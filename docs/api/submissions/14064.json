He never stood up for me, but when we were alone he went back to being fun and nice so I always forgave him.\n\nWhen we were teenagers and got part-time jobs, I started buying him birthday and Christmas presents even though he never did the same. Our parents said it was because he's younger and would eventually, but to this day I have never received a gift from him personally. Now that we're adults, I call and text him occasionally to check in, and though he's nice when he responds, he doesn't initiate. I figured that was just how he is. I always put more work in, but he's my brother and I love him.\n\nI'm graduating from graduate school soon, and I invited my whole family out to celebrate. Everyone got a plane ticket and hotel room I'm paying for and it's been planned out for months. The other day, my brother called me to say that he was picking up a new puppy the day before my graduation and that he couldn't make it. Something inside me broke a little. I asked if it really had to be that day, if he couldn't postpone it for a week or something, but he said no dice and to cancel his reservations. I said okay and hung up. I decided I was done being in a one-way relationship with him, even though I always thought of him as my best friend.\n\nLater, I was talking to our mom and she was saying how excited she is to see us, and I told her, \"Oh, brother's not coming. He chose a dog over me.\" She asked what I was talking about, and I explained. She said she was disappointed but not surprised. Word got out and my brother called me, really hushed and sad and said what I said wasn't cool. I said I just told the truth. He called me an AH and we haven't spoken since. I said what I said in anger and bitterness, but now I'm feeling really guilty because I've always forgiven my brother and I've never heard him sound the way he did on the phone.

Wish you had said it to him directly, but in either case he finally heard the truth.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s upset **not** because he hurt your feelings, but because he knows you recognize the imbalance in your relationship. He\u2019s also upset because other people either now see how he treated you or now \u201cpublicly\u201d acknowledge it.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the following statement to be mean, I\u2019m saying it so you can see how obvious it is to a Reddit Rando who has never met you or any of your family members: Your brother is self-centered and absolutely puts his own interests above you. Even your mother acknowledges this when you told her he was not attending because he was picking up a puppy: \u201cShe said she was disappointed but not surprised.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I can imagine being on the outs with your brother hurts a lot.

The fact that you're even questioning whether you are, speaks volumes about the long-term emotional abuse you've endured from your brother. You need to cut contact with him and be done. Your brother sounds extremely toxic, callous, and cruel. You don't need someone like that in your life. And I know it's hard to hear, but he's not your *best friend*, and he never will be. He's not worth the energy, trauma, and heartache, sweetie. Just move on.", "NTA, there\u2019s no way that he planned to get the dog BEFORE knowing when graduation is. Especially since you graciously got him a FREE room. He purposefully chose to be selfish, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s on his side.

I haven\u2019t spoken to my brother for over 10yrs\u2026. Long story short. I hadnt seen him for 2yrs He and his wife planned a surprised trip to town, so I wasn\u2019t able to book time off work. Which meant I was unable to see them. When they were free I was working and when I was free they were busy etc. after their trip I told my mum I was disappointed they didn\u2019t make more effort to see me (or atleast give me a heads up they were coming).. brother got angry and told me not to ever talk to him again and i haven\u2019t. It\u2019s sucks but what can you do", "NTA. You just called your brother\u2019s behavior what it is, and now he\u2019s shifting his guilt onto you and trying to dodge accountability.

You have great things coming in your future! :)\n\nNTA. That's just so shitty. I'm so sorry.\n\nYour brother is a taker and an AH. Don't feel guilty for calling him out on his bad behavior to you.

We can't possibly know all of the context of your relationship from your post, but you've described an extremely one-sided need for his approval, that seems to be some combination of him/his friends bullying you and you trying desperately to force a relationship with somebody who is very clearly trying to ice you out, and you definitely need to work through that sort of thing professionally. The \"choosing a dog over you\" is a wakeup call that something here is deeply screwed up and needs re-evaluation more than anything.", "NTA for the comment because it's true.\n\nBut. I do think your relationship with your brother is unhealthy based on what you describe. It's pretty clear that you two want to be in each other's lives a different amount and there's no easy answer to handling that. I do think you should talk to him about how one-sided things have been for so long but I also think you should back off. He's made it pretty clear with his apathy that he doesn't value your relationship as much as you do. It's unfortunate but you're setting yourself up for disappointment by expecting otherwise.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your brother is either. It\u2019s pretty bad of him to cancel after all the reservations has been made. But do you think you tried to push a relationship on him.", "Nah. \n\nIt sounds like you're hurt and he has never returned your intense attachment to him- which is his right. Inviting yourself to stuff, following his friends around unwanted, and describing yourself as his best friend aren't marks of a healthy sibling dynamic.", "NTA If your brother is offended is because he knows he is doing wrong. Your brother count to much on your good will to have a relationship with you and is taking you for granted. I think that this a good opportunity to talk about reciprocity with him.", "lol NTA, the brother is kind of an asshat.", "NTA - but if you continue to think of him and his feelings over your own your whole life, you\u2019d be TA to yourself.", "NTA. It's sad.", "NTA. But I don't think your brother is the AH either. I totally understand why you'd be frustrated and disappointed, I would be too. But adopting a pet is hard and if he puts the adoption appointment on hold, there's a very strong chance that the dog would be adopted by someone else. So he probably saw that opportunity as now or never. That said, if he had to miss your graduation trip to adopt this dog, he should have at least made it up to you by planning a trip to visit you at a different time.", "NTA and if I were you I'd take the opportunity to expand on your thoughts in an email or text. He knows you're upset about this one instance. I'd let him know it's not just the dog. That how people act shows their priorities, and you've always gotten him presents for birthdays and Christmas, and you always initiate conversation but he never responds in kind. Tell him the fact that he blew off your graduation confirms what you'd been feeling for a long time. And that you will stop trying so hard to be involved in his life, though it may be difficult for you.\n\nThis might give him the wake-up call that it's more than just deciding to adopt a dog right when you are graduating. He probably doesn't know how you are interpreting his actions and how much it bothers you. Once you do this, he will either rise to the occasion or he won't. This is giving him one last chance. Plenty of people don't appreciate what they have until they don't have it anymore.", "NTA, and that sound you heard from him was his being called out. When my father died, I tried to establish a relationship with my half brother. I made all the attempts, he didn't do anything. The last conversation we had I had asked if he wanted to get together at Christmas (my dad died on Thanksgiving). He never replied to anything and never reached out. It was then that I decided that if he didn't think enough about me to want to attempt a relationship, then all I could do is walk away, Yeah it hurt, but life is too damn short to put effort into a one sided relationship. He has shown you time after time that he has no intention of cultivating a relationship, believe him.  You can love him, but you don't owe him the right to make you feel bad.", "NTA. You told the truth and he got upset. I would recommend low contact or no contact because it seems like your brother does not care about you and you've always forgiven him and given him gifts but he has never reciprocated.", "He did choose a dog over you. He chose bullies over you. He chose never to give you a gift. You're not his sister.  You are just an afterthought.  Sorry. NTA except to yourself.", "NTA, I thought my sibling was my best friend as well until one day it literally hit me on the head that I wasn't when she knowingly hurt my feelings and didn't care. I had to take a step back, she's not my best friend and it hurt a lot more to even realize I've been spending a lot of time and energy on somebody who I consider to be the most important person in my life and I didn't register as important to them at all. At this point in time she's just a step from being an acquaintance, had been for the last 13 years. You can't force somebody to want something that you do that they don't. Wish you the best of luck.", "YTA - it sounds like you don't care for your brothers personal space and have spent most of your life inserting yourself into his plans and friend groups without any consideration to him or his friends. you need to give him space and stop pushing yourself into everything he does, its kinda creepy.", "NTA, but it's time to stop contacting your brother. At all. Ever.", "NTA. You told the truth. He's not upset that he hurt you, he's upset that you're finally calling him on his bullshit.", "NAH, it\u2019s fair that your upset he missed your graduate. But a dog is a 10+ year commitment and missing one thing to find the right dog is totally reasonable.

I'm wondering where your parents were in all of this when you were growing up: were they pushing to have you two do everything together, so he got resentful of always being told to include his sister? Did they ever try to help you both establish some healthy space? I think your parents let this misunderstanding go way too far, it seems like they noticed that things weren't balanced but decided to pretend everything was fine.", "NTA, I think you\u2019re in deep, **deep** denial over your brother. He doesn\u2019t act like your friend or even your sibling so not sure why you latched on to him so hard. \n\nEven now, knowing how excited you are about your graduation and knowing your plans, he decided to get a dog. He is telling you without words exactly where you stand in his life. Time to cut the cord. Maybe send him one last letter detailing one sided relationship and your hurt and confusion as to why he doesn\u2019t seem to want you in his life and conclude with \u201cmessage received, will not contact you again\u201c.", "I had a friend once, we used to go out a lot and it was really cool, we laughed, we had fun etc. But somehow I was always the person who would call up and ask if we should go out, or if we could meet. One day I thought I will test it and did not call her. Our friendship ended that day. She never phoned or texted me, never tried to make any contact. There are weird people out there. \n\nObviously your brother is not this extreme, but it's kind of the same one sided relationship where he just takes what you give and does not bother to invest anything. NTA", "NTA for how you feel, those are your feelings. \n\nBut all I could think about while reading your post is, your younger brother having his older sister always tag along with his friends. No brother/sister wants their sibling to always tag along, and I think we\u2019ve read stories on Reddit on how much they would hate to be forced to invite sibling/ and share friends. To me it seems like you were the annoying sister, and made this whole one sided relationship. Have you discuss any of this with him? You may have your side of things but he also has his, and you may need to hear his reasons as to why he\u2019s not close to you.", " My sister has been gone for many years. She was just like you but the difference was,so was I. We were *each other\u2019s* best friends. You obviously always wanted that and I don\u2019t blame you because it\u2019s great,but he definitely is not that kind of sibling. I think that anything you thought that was great about him was really just you filling in the blanks. There may come a day when he\u2019s older when he thinks back and realizes that the best peer in his life was always right there in front of him,but you can\u2019t count on that. For now,you have to see that you didn\u2019t lose your best friend. He never existed to begin with. NTA,obviously,and congratulations on graduating. Good luck moving forward.", "As I read your post, I thought I could be reading about my life. In my case, my brother is younger. I was two years old and in love with him from the moment my parents brought him home.  I was so excited to be a big sister, but like you, I was always the one chasing him to have a relationship.  It took me until I was around 25 to really see what was happening, and I stopped.  I don't know if he even noticed, but my mom did and asked me about it.  I told her I realized he didn't care about me, and I wasn't going to chase him anymore.  She argued with me about it for months and finally told me how much it hurt her, so I started trying again for her, and I did it for years.  I regret that so much now. After she passed away, I was proven right, and he started a fight so he wouldn't have to pay me back the money he owed me.  That was 5 years ago and I haven't seen him since, and I don't expect to. I grieved as if he had died and moved on.\n\nPlease don't let other people guilt you into continuing to chase him. It will bring you nothing but pain. Be civil when you see him at family gatherings, but please stop chasing him for a relationship that will never happen. I'm not going to lie to you, it's going to hurt, but after the grief, there can be peace.", "NTA\nHe got called out and is sore about it. You are valid in your feelings and your relationship has been one sided. Leave him be your really not missing anything since he doesn't care to reach out or do anything. Ripe that band-aid off and accept it for what it is.", "ESH. him for allowing his friends bully you and you for not getting the hint that he doesn't like you.\n\nAt the bare minimum, he should at least get you gifts, but I do think he just sees you as his annoying older sister. The graduation thing tho is a sign that you need to move on and limit your contact at least till you feel better. He's not the worst person but that's actually very hurtful. I would advise you to seek therapy.\n\nESH. him for allowing his friends to bully you and you for not getting the hint that he doesn't like you.ve shown. Although, you acknowledge that you've bothered him a lot for a very long time and that you're sorry for not picking up on the signs.  But it's very disappointing that he doesn't even do the bare minimum like getting gifts etc.  And that you have gotten the message clearly that I wish you happiness but I'm going to stop making any effort with you from now on. Bye.\n\n He's your distant relative at this point.", "NTA, but he honestly never had your back, I understand why you were attached to him, but it's really time to reassess the relationship.\n\nIf your celebration mattered to him, he would not create a situation where he needed to pick up a puppy and couldn't go.", "NTA\n\nYou just told truth. Maybe your brother doesnt want to see you, beacuse you make him feel that he must repay you for all of this so this \"payed\" hotel would be another bill. Or he just dont care about you, but he have problem to be painted in bad light in front of yours family", "> I've never heard him sound the way he did on the phone.\n\nBecause you've never called him out on it before. \n\nThink about your mom's response: she wasn't surprised at all by your brother's behavior.

Sometimes Reddit people say something along the lines of \u201cif you\u2019re upset people are being told about your behaviour, the problem isn\u2019t the telling, but the behaviour\u201d.

Move on and love those who love you.", "NTA, but you should articulate all of your feelings and why you won't be driving the relationship anymore.", "Nta there's no reason why you should feel bad. If he's mad it's because the truth got out how he treated you and he doesn't like it. All you did was say the truth.", "NTA. He's not even upset about what he's done, he's just mad that now other people see him for the AH he is.", "NTA. You told people the truth about what he did. If he doesn't want to look bad when people tell the truth, maybe he should make the truth less shitty looking. Also I'm very glad that you've decided to stop giving him everything in this relationship. You don't have to be nice to shit people just because you're related. Him sounding sad is likely just a guilt trip to make you feel bad - hey look, it worked! He's manipulating you.", "NTA - one thing to bear in mind. He is genuinely upset. You have always let him do what he wants and now, by not forgiving him and not lying to others for him you have stopped protecting his feelings and he feels bad. \n\nHe responded by calling to get you to make him feel better. Which you normally would have done. If someone feels bad because you literally state what they have done, then you did not make them feel bad, they did something that any non-AH would have immediately realised was bad, or wouldn't have done in the first place.", "NTA, he's used to you being a pushover. You finally standing up for yourself probably shocked him more than anything.", "NTA. He did pick a dog over you, and I am so sorry for that. I can't imagine how that must've hurt your feelings and don't let him make you question your feelings at all. Again I am so sorry.", "NTA it really hurts when your own family doesn't care about you.", "NTA obviously. Sorry he burned the bridge.", "He really did chose a puppy over you though, of course there is nothing cool about that\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d NTA", "NTA\n\nShow him your post or write it out again and show him.

Focus on your friends outside of your family for a bit.", "NTA. Your brother sucks and you should have called it quits on this one sided relationship a long time ago. You deserve people around you who love you and want to spend time with you.", "NTA. This is a really toxic sibling relationship and you need to close the door here for your own sake. He is so far up his own ass because he is use to you always being there. \n\nIf we just dip out nose into you brothers behaviour from kid to now. When you hang around him and his friends he probably did not want you there and when friends bullied you he just let it go on. That with you always coming back and hanging around has led him to treat you like nothing. \n\nThis tickles my brain on behaviors. \n\nYou need to break this wheel. We believe in you!", "NTA. A spade doesn't get to be surprised at being called a spade. He did choose a dog over you.", "NTA- you told the truth and you should keep telling the truth.

Your bother is though, very mean of him to cancel with such short notice.", "Nta. Good on you for finally recognizing that its a toxic relationship.", "Don\u2019t feel guilty. Keep thinking about what you wrote", "NTA - For whatever reason, and I suspect there are things you are leaving out, your brother doesn't like you that much. He's not obligated to like you, either. I would have selected N A H but your brother needs to admit that he chose a dog over you. But you need to just accept that your brother doesn't like you or want to hang out with you and move on.", "Okay, let me get this straight. \n\nAll your life you have sort of idolized your relationship with your bro. You have been good to him, regardless of how he treats you. \n\nAll your life, he never cared how you were treated by anyone, including himself. He would be nice to you at home mostly, and because he had noone else at home to hang out with. \n\nHe literally had you spend money on him and promised to come celebrate one of your milestones, then decided he needed a puppy more? \n\nHe  then gets mad that, for the first time, you said something derogatory about him flaking on your graduation. And he calls you the ah??!!\n\nNope! You are within your rights to be upset. He is used to walking on you, so he sees no issue. But I think it is high time you stopped allowing it!!\n\nDo not let your brother, or his social successes, cause you to undervalue yourself!! He isn't worth it!", "NTA your brother has treated you like crap forever he is taking you for granted. Do yourself a favor and let him initiate from now on.

Probably, but most breeders charge a fee. And brother doesn\u2019t sound close to sister or interested in a close relationship, so he chose to not go instead of paying the fee.", "Tell me you we're the golden child, without telling me you were the golden child.", "Yeah, honestly the post is pretty open that she always wanted to be close and he never did. Nice in response to her reaching out but not initiating is like the definition of low contact, as so often recommended on here. \n\nAlso, I absolutely adore my siblings, but I probably would skip a graduation to pick up a puppy (and celebrate with them later), so that colours my view.\n\nBoth rescue and waiting on responsible breeders can absolutely cause time-sensitive clashes like this.\n\nI don't think OP is a bad person for being sad like this, but even their post clearly paints the brother as someone who's trying to keep an over-invested sibling at arms length without hurting them.", "I don't know if I would go so far as to say OP is TA but I agree with your reasonings. Like just because you are lonely and don't have friends does not mean you should force relationships with people they clearly don't want to have. I think she gets a pass for it as a kid but she needs to accept now that it's a really one-sided relationship and to stop maintaining it if she's gonna feel resentful over him not reciprocating it (and that is totally fair).", "I voted NAH but agree with this post.", "The vibes I'm getting are a clingy older sister won't leave her brother alone, so the brother and his friends escalate their mean behavior to get the message across, but literally nothing works. And now that clingy older sister is confused on why her brother is \"choosing a dog over her.\"", "this is terrible advice.", "This is an absolutely valid and important question. I appreciate the insight you had to ask this question, because I realized I simply *assumed* the brother had agreed to attend. While my assumption turned out to be correct, it still was not a good thing to assume.\n\nI\u2019m very glad to see that OP answered this question. (Apparently, yes, the brother agreed to come before OP booked anything.)", "Maybe that\u2019s why he never cared for you? You brought your problems to his social life by following him around like a dog. His friends didn\u2019t like you and you probably ruined a lot of hang outs by forcing yourself there.", "NTA, I appreciate you are upset, but be careful of looking at this with an 'all or nothing' perspective (either your brother was your best friend or didn't give a damn). I think it's much more likely to be somewhere in the middle. Your brother has been taking you for granted, and now you can hopefully repair your relationship to something more even rather than one sided.", "This! Exactly. The second she did take the hint he called her up to complain.", "Cause she exposed him \ud83d\udc80", "It's time to really explore these feelings with a therapist. You're NTA  for saying what you said, but you would be the asshole to yourself for not resolving why we ended up here.", "What information provided here makes you feel that way?

I'm not saying you're wrong, but like, you said that in a hurtful way.", "You couldn't be anymore reddit if you tried.", "Came here looking for this comment. From the OP I was getting some undertones of maybe childhood resentment from the brother. I would recommend speaking to a professional about this as well.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve just read too many of these posts at this point but I think I could see a post from the brother on his side of the story and I\u2019m not super sure whose side I would take on it re:the history.

Just because OP has initiated contact or gift-giving, doesn\u2019t mean he wanted or expected it.", "Pretty much everything Op wrote feels that way. She couldn't make her own friends so forced her way to her brother's friends group. Even if they bullied her she wouldn't leave them alone. Those children were communicating in they own way that they don't want Op around and she couldn't take the hint. \n\nWhy is it on him to communicate? You realize he was a small boy, 2 years younger than Op and this started early on. Children aren't known for their great communicating skills. Perhaps he tried and Op once again couldn't take the hint or his parents just forced him to take her with him. Everything that Op wrote is about how she forces herself and her feeling on him, it's clearly not reciprocated.\n\nEven now it's Op always reaching out although she knows he doesn't care. She's not owed a relationship no matter how much she wants one.", "It's wild to me\u2014OP clearly built her entire childhood around her younger brother's life. I can only imagine how resentful her brother must have been and how much of a target for bullying *he* likely became when his self-admittedly \"awkward\" older sister insisted on *following him and his friends around all the time*. How much he probably hated the feeling of obligation you get when someone you don't like gets you a gift and clearly expects you to reciprocate or at least perform a lot of gratitude.\n\nThe guy does not and never has wanted a deep relationship with her, and I understand why.", "True, its hard to tell what the brother wants.

Thank you for clarifying this, OP.", "I'm sorry you are going through this. You have nothing to feel bad about. Chin up! Congratulations on your great accomplishment!!", "Then why is he upset when she points out the same? If he feels resentment for how his sister was during their childhood and he doesn't want a relationship with her, wouldn't he feel relieved she finally got the message?", "Not sure how that relates to the unfounded assumption that he\u2019s taking anything \u201cfor granted.\u201d", "You\u2019re so intent on being right that you\u2019re not paying attention to the facts here.", "Thats a lot of words to say \"I'm wrong and don't want to admit it\"", "OP replied to your original comment to correct your assumptions.", "He didn't sound upset that she \"got the message,\" but upset at the way she was framing his decision not to attend to family members who were then harassing him.", "Because by accepting the gift you're allowing it to continue without putting a stop to it while knowing he will not reciprocate it.

It seems to me like what she said was pretty accurate.\n\nEdit: and to add to that, she told *her mom* and then the word spread, she didn't call the relatives one by one to tell them - at least that is the story we got and I'm judging based on that", "Allowing something to continue =/= taking it for granted.", "We have no idea if the brother's dog adoption situation is time-sensitive (i.e. has to take place on that day), if he only gave a tentative agreement to the graduation plans, etc. I'm getting an unreliable-narrator vibe from OP, and I wonder if this was a \"last straw\" situation for him where OP has once again sicced family members on him for not going with her plans. We don't know if their parents forced the brother to bring OP with him to things with his friends or simply enabled her by encouraging her behavior and supporting her if she came to them crying about being left out. Maybe the parents, too, have been trying to force this relationship and he's annoyed that she didn't just say he couldn't attend anymore, or at least redirect them to ask him why he wasn't going to be attending.", "\"No, he's not coming, he has to pick up his new puppy\"?\n\nOP feels the way she feels but the way she frames it **is** intentionally pointed.", "\"Brother chose his own life and priorities over mine\" pretty much covers it.

He's a grown man who is allowed to put his own life first.", "You're getting \"unreliable-narrator\" vibes from OP so you are creating a scenario about a little brother who had his childhood ruined by an obsessive sister, so I'm also going by a different scenario that I find equally possible where the brother was simply never interested in a relationship with his sister but also didn't mind her thinking there was one. \n\nIn my scenario, why would OP try to cover for her brother, and why would it be so weird that she complained about him (dramatically, exaggerating, whatever) to her mom?", "This is a good point. I didn\u2019t even consider the potential siccing of family angle, I could definitely see a last straw situation here.", "And again, she was talking **to her mom**", "OP said that to her mom, I don't think it's weird.\n\nAnd I find \"he chose his own life and priorities over mine\" equally pointed an answer to \"why isn't your brother coming to this family celebration\"."]}
