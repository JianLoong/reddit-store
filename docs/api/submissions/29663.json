Our mother works, while our dad, who was born with very small arms and legs due to thalidomide, struggles to look after the kids on his own. For a long time, we had a live-in nanny to help, but things changed when our mom decided, \"Why pay for someone to look after my far-too-many-children when I can get the older ones to do it for free?\"  \nMy twin sister has moved away to college, leaving me to handle the daily childcare responsibilities.  \nThe situation has become so extreme that my youngest siblings now call me \"Mummy\" instead of our actual mother, who rarely interacts with them. She doesn't know their preferences or interests (for Christmas, she bought 6F a Charlie and Lola book forgetting that it is actually 4F who likes those and 6F hates them).  \nShe spends her mornings at the gym, works all day, and when she returns, she retreats to her bedroom, claiming she's too stressed and exhausted to engage with anyone. Even on weekends, she's glued to her phone in the living room while the younger kids seek her attention, misbehave, and even put themselves in dangerous situations to get noticed. And I get blamed for not taking care of them properly.  \nRecently, I reached my breaking point. I was already busy calming down one of my brothers during a panic attack when my mother came downstairs, dragging another sibling along and insisting that I watch over them better because they were \u201cbothering her\u201d. She reminded me that now that I'm 18, she can kick me out at any time if I want to keep living at home, so I need to be more responsible.  \nThat's when I lost my temper. I explained that my grades are suffering because I'm juggling my own important exams with taking on the role of a mother of seven. I told her that she needs to be a real mother to her kids and be more responsible herself. I also stressed that I'm worth much more to her than she's acknowledging, and if I leave, her freedom to pretend she doesn't have any children would disappear.  \nIn response, she claimed I didn't understand the pressure she's under. My dad later mentioned how challenging it is for her to provide for eleven people nearly single-handedly. He said I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on her because she\u2019s dealing with a lot of stress.
