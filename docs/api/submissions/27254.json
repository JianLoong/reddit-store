Her for the \"not the sort of person who uses public transport\" comment, and you for not allowing her to take the car after a 12 hour shift. Is it an environmental thing, or a cost thing with you?", "Calling 50/50 on this one because, given someone just worked a 12 hr shift at a hospital (helping others), you don't really get to dictate how tired they are and justify it off your personal metric of tiredness-enough-to-get-public-transport.\n\nIf someone said they just finished 12 hrs at a hospital I'd be more inclined to just make their life easier (for that particular day, not like every single day), whereas if someone said to me that they just finished 6 hour shift sat in an office, and said they were shattered, then yeah I'd like \ud83e\udd28 \"really?\".\n\nBut I think some of your reluctance comes from the fact that yes I'd definitely say she seems to come across as \"snobby\" if she thinks she's too good for public transport. Although that is a lesson I think you and your wife need to decide if it's something you make her to do or not (and if it'd worth the arguments which are clearly going to ensue because of that) because at the end of the day the car is legally yours, you can say no at any time you see fit.", "ESH.

She's already gotten somewhere in life.\n\nHer attitude towards people who take public transportation might suck, but she's an adult who can take responsibility for her own actions. If her attitude comes back to bite her later on, that's her problem, not yours.\n\nShe asked for the car because as an adult who makes adult decisions, she chose to drive to pick up her package after a long day at work.

It\u2019s mentally taxing to be on alert at all times, make sure I\u2019m holding my keys so I can use them to defend myself if needed, making sure my safety alert app is working so everyone knows I\u2019m in an Uber and will make it to my destination. There are entire niches dedicated to protecting women from other people where i don\u2019t think men really think about it in the same way. I\u2019ve had times where men have acted yucky towards me on public transportation. Less so on the train, more so on buses. And it has nothing to do with class or status. People behave badly everywhere, from every walk of life. Even walking in my neighborhood at night, I\u2019ve had men acting badly (for example, a dude pulling up next to me and wacking off, come to find he\u2019s done it to many women and police can\u2019t find him) so my husband would rather he walk our dogs or at the very least insists I always carry my mace. \n\nI would rather my child, who has been responsible with my belongings and not abusing the privilege, take my car and have less to worry about.

No matter how snobbish Ellie's comment sounded, a doctor who works multiple 12h shifts, helping people, deserves some comfort on her rare day off.

Shoes are so important to helping recover from those shifts. Every single one of doctor/nurse/hospital employees friends and family have always needed a day or two to recover from hospital work, especially since Covid. Some just sleep for 20 hours after back to back shifts. It can be heartbreaking work, they might lose a patient (a kid can affect most I know the most), they might have mental health patients that abuse them for hours on end fighting physically, heck some mean old person can hurl more insults and be more demanding and aggressive and taxing than any of the others. The stories I hear are intense. \n\nYour daughter is newer to the scene and might get the worst cases that no one wants to handle, a little new resident hazing of sorts. Dealing with the stress of all this pain and suffering takes a while to get numb to, she might not be comfortable telling you everything. Those little comforts like a drive by herself, new shoes, a quiet day without people might make or break her own mental health. She might be saying things she doesn\u2019t mean really because she just is at the end of her rope. It might take a while to desensitize to all the drama and trauma of hospital work, maybe give a little grace in the meantime.", "ESH, her attitude towards people who use public transport is pretty gross. And her private school upbringing could be it. But I feel a jealousy or like a power play coming from you. It would have been so easy to just let her use the car. \n\nBut also I get only wanting to use your car for certain things, and you allow her to use your car for work. Which is already nice of you. But since she is literally a doctor, she could just buy herself a car and save everyone the trouble. You would have your car whenever you want, and she wouldn\u2019t have to stick to your odd rules. \n\nESH: you should have let her use it, but she does have a bad attitude toward poorer people. Probably not good as a literal doctor. Also she\u2019s a doctor, she can buy her own car", "Or a power thing", "Couldn't agree more.", ">whereas if someone said to me that they just finished 6 hour shift sat in an office, and said they were shattered, then yeah I'd like \ud83e\udd28 \"really?\".\n\nI'd give this person the benefit of a doubt because that was me a few years back. My work is mentally demanding and it caused me a lot of anxiety and stress. There were days where I would be so fatigued at 6pm that I would take a nap when me and the kids made it home.", "I'm far more exhausted sat in an office then when I was working on my feet, it's far more mentally exhausting.", "Totally agree with this. ESH", "Having a terrible attitude towards the people she's supposed to be helping is definitely not just a \"oh well, that sucks\" sort of situation.", "She's a doctor living with her dad, she can afford a car if she wants one. NTA.", "It\u2019s not her car, an adult child is not entitled to their parents car. If she was that desperate not to walk she could have called an Uber. She\u2019s an adult, if she\u2019s too good for public transport, she can get her own car and use it whenever she wants.", "And as an adult who makes adult decisions, if she wants to drive to get that package, she can get her own car.\n\nBeing an adult who makes adult decisions doesn't mean the car isn't OPs and he doesn't get to choose when it's used.", "She can\u2019t make decisions using things that belong to other people. That\u2019s for them to decide.\n\nBoth slightly assholes in this situation.", "You explained why she sucks too. Remember there's ESH as an option", "She's an adult making the decision to use someone else's property when another option was available. If I was in OP's shoes, I would have let her use the car (a 20 minute public transit journey is probably a 10 minute car trip), but she is still an AH for thinking public transit is beneath her. If she is too good for the bus she should buy her own car.", "She's a DOCTOR who has a condescending attitude about other people. She's certainly gotten somewhere in life where that attitude can have terrible outcomes for people left in her care.", "Lady called her mom because her dad wouldn\u2019t let her use the car. She\u2019s not a doctor, she\u2019s a child", "An adult and a doctor living at her Dads house without a car.", ">Why\n\nNot wanting to waste gas on a short drive, not wanting to search for parking, enjoying the exercise and fresh air. If OP lives in the US, it's hard to find places where a walkable lifestyle is possible. His attitude towards modern car culture isn't the issue here, it's his attitude towards his daughter.", "Because he wants to be conscious of the environment? Or maybe he doesn't want unnecessary wear on the vehicle. The \"why\" doesn't really matter, both OP and his daughter are adults, adults get to decide who uses their property and when", "Its 5 minutes, its not like she\u2019ll die if she doesn\u2019t get her shoes at that very moment or if she takes public transport", "Its HIS car calling someone an AH for not letting someone use your car is stupid, also she doesn\u2019t have to get her precious yeezies at that very moment.", "Tell me time is not an issue next time you pull an 120 hour week. In those circumstances, if you get more than 6 consecutive hours off, you sure as shit don\u2019t want to be spending them sitting on a bus.", "The answer is literally in the post.", "Or, he called someone who knows what a petty tyrant OP can be over those he has little power over....", "My judgment is also Esh because at the end of the day she did work a12-hour shift and she is tired on her feet which I can honestly understand but her comment on not being the sort of type to use public transport and her mindset of it being for unsuccessful people is quite snobbish indeed. Opie is right about the whole she should step back from that attitude or else she won't make her life any easier because not everyone in this world has the whole Prestige as her but Opie should have realized that her daughter is tired and 12 hour shifts are no joke.\n\nESH again\n\nAlso the mother was totally exaggerating by the whole holding her back and robbing her of her life because that's just ridiculous", "Yep, science involves a lot of computer work (data analysis, strategy, slide deck making) that can be extremely fatiguing and stressful.", "Ah right, you know what I mean as in a typical sense that someone working a 12 hour hospital shift, compared to say a sit-down office job, in a day-to-day basis. I understand that there could be people dealing with scientific calculations, Air traffic control, who sit down at a desk all day and is high-intensity but I was just referring to easy office-jobs in a sense", "Working in a hospital means you can be on your feet for 12 hrs and mentally exhausted at the same time.", "Right and I'm assuming that the OP's daughter can relate to office-work in regards to a 12-hour shift working in an office or doing her admin (which im sure she probably has abit of). But have you done a 12 hour shift as a doctor before? And hence can you directly relate?", "Doctors aren\u2019t making bank fresh out of med school\n\nThey typically have to complete four years undergraduate, four years in medical school, and then three to seven years in a residency program. It usually ends up being 10-14 years at the absolute shortest which would put her at age 28. She\u2019s only 26, possibly still a resident, possibly still paying off med school loans.", "She could have a lot of student debt. Not excusing her attitude though.", "And I'm sure she's going to buy one today, but until now she had an arrangement with OP that seemed to be working for both of them.", "Probably not yet. Unless she skipped a couple of grades, she's likely still in residency", "At 26 it's HIGHLY UNLIKELY she's a doctor but possibly she's a med student.  Likely can't afford a car-- but according to OP mommy is quite wealthy and could buy her a car--if this is even a true story and not rage bait.", "I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s they are in the U.K., based on the vocabulary used, so that really might not be true. Physicians are not paid nearly as well.", "She can definitely get her own car, but she and OP had an arrangement that seemed to be working for them until now. She had no idea there were these weird strings attached, but now that she's aware, I'm sure she's going to get her own car ASAP.", "Or she\u2019s just close with her mom and tells her everything. Kids vent to their parents when they trust them.", "Or, she called the one person who knows what a petty tyrant OP can be to those he has a little power over.", "She called her mom because her mom knows what an asshole her dad is and is the right person to commiserate with. \n\nShe is doctor. Your erroneous belief that only a child would need to vent to someone doesn\u2019t negate her being a doctor.", "At any given time that's reasonable, but having a hard and fast rule is not.", "The \"why\" is incredibly important. If the why isn't a good reason, then he's being an asshole by making somebody's life more difficult for no good reason.", "Its 5 mins to the bus stop, its 20 mins for the whole journey.", "Honey, I work in film. I work 14 hour days regularly, 5 days a week, and then will often work weekends on a different project. I still don't believe I'm entitled to someone else's vehicle to run my personal errands.", "  Missed that. Thank you", "Yes! This is so true before I used to do a lot of fieldwork which is understandable why i would be exhausted. With my current work, it\u2019s so much thinking about thinking, strategy, and creation which is mentally exhausting.

At the end of the day, it's OP's car and he gets to decide who uses it and when. NTA", "OP didn't state where they live, so hard to judge based on location for usual university and training times, but I was a doctor at 23 and so were the majority of my peers. That's normal in our location. So definitely possible she's a doctor.", "It makes a lot more sense if you consider that they\u2019re probably in the U.K.\u2014So the daughter can definitely be a doctor but she\u2019s not likely to be paid anywhere near what a doctor in the U.S. would make", "Lady called her mom because her dad wouldn\u2019t let her use the car. She\u2019s not a doctor, she\u2019s a child", "She and OP had an arrangement that she could use the car to go to work, if you are so hung up on the arrangement surely the fact that this falls outside the arrangement is relevant right?", "She's not a kid, she's 26. She's not venting, she's whining, and she should know from experience whether her mom's going to stick her nose where it doesn't belong, and not tell her things that aren't her business if she can't keep out of them. And if mom feels so bad, she can lend out her car. I just can't imagine being an adult for 8 fucking years and not learning to get somewhere on your own without depending on somebody else. 26 year old kid, give me a break! A fucking doctor!", "Well, if she doesn't like OP enforcing when his car gets driven or not, she can buy her own. Not go crying to mommy.", "Petty is calling somebody's spouse or ex-spouse, whichever it is, to whine because you are minorly inconvenienced. What a tyrant OP is, letting her live at his home as an adult, allowing her to drive his car to work every day. Absolute monster.", "Bullshit, she called mom because she wanted her mom to guilt her dad into letting her have her way. It's a teenage girl move. She's not Doogie Howser, it's time to grow up.", "It's his car, why doesn't he get to decide on a hard and fast rule?", "Whatever reason he gives is a good enough reason. The fact of the matter is that the car is owned by OP, not his daughter. She doesn't get to dictate when she \"needs\" the car, no matter how long she's worked; it just shows what an entitled, spoiled and snobby brat she is.", "So a 5 minute walk and 15 minutes sitting on a bus. Sounds excruciating /s. \nI\u2019d much prefer the bus option if I had just worked a 12 hour shift. My feet wouldn\u2019t need to be on the pedals, I only need to focus on which stop to get off at and not all the potential hazards operating a vehicle has. If she\u2019s too tired to walk to a bus stop then she is too tired to drive safely", "My bad, but it\u2019s still a similar situation. If it\u2019s the uk, she was probably in med school till age 23 or so and is now on some type of training pathway that will take about 8-10 years. Still comes with bad debt a lot of the time, but higher pay for medical residents if that\u2019s what she is, so she might pay it off more quickly.", "Picking up her shoes on her one day off isn\u2019t a frivolous trip.", "Or she\u2019s just close with her mom and tells her everything.

Her venting to her mom isn\u2019t the same thing as whining. And her mom may live too far away to loan her her car.", "Because the rule doesn't make any sense. He *can*, but making and enforcing such a rule makes him an asshole, and he's asking if he's being an asshole.", "*shrug* agree to disagree. I'd lend any family member my car for pretty much any reason. OP sounds like he's just petty to me, and envious of his daughters upbringing. Glad we're not family.", ">So a 5 minute walk and 15 minutes sitting on a bus.\n\nYou forgot the journey back so its a 10 minute walk and 30 mins bus ride, 40 mins back and forth.

If she\u2019s too tired to walk to a bus stop then she is too tired to drive safely\n\nWhy should she do a 40 mins journey when she can drive and get it done in a much shorter time? Just sounds dumb.
