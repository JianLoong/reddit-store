It's about a 20 minute journey. \n\nElla asked if she could borrow the car to pick up the shoes. I said no. I only use the car to get to work, if I'm carrying a lot of things. I don't use the car for anywhere that is walking distance or a short journey on public transport. \n\nElla got upset, and argued that she's been on her feet all day for several days and is too tired. She then said that she's \"not the sort of person who uses public transport\". \n\nHer mother's and their family are extremely well off. Ella went to a very prestigious private school. Unfortunately they also have certain... attitudes towards people not as fortunate, one of which is that public transport is used by \"unsuccessful\" people.

She swore at me and stormed off, but did end up going on the bus to get the shoes. \n\nWhile she was gone Ella's mother called me, shouting at me for \"making our daughter's life difficult\" and accusing me of \"trying to hold her back\" etc. She said I should \"show that I care\" that she's worked so hard at the hospital.\n\nI accept that I shouldn't have said the private school comment, but Ella isn't so tired she can't brave a 5 minute walk to the bus stop.

Her for the \"not the sort of person who uses public transport\" comment, and you for not allowing her to take the car after a 12 hour shift. Is it an environmental thing, or a cost thing with you?", "Calling 50/50 on this one because, given someone just worked a 12 hr shift at a hospital (helping others), you don't really get to dictate how tired they are and justify it off your personal metric of tiredness-enough-to-get-public-transport.\n\nIf someone said they just finished 12 hrs at a hospital I'd be more inclined to just make their life easier (for that particular day, not like every single day), whereas if someone said to me that they just finished 6 hour shift sat in an office, and said they were shattered, then yeah I'd like \ud83e\udd28 \"really?\".\n\nBut I think some of your reluctance comes from the fact that yes I'd definitely say she seems to come across as \"snobby\" if she thinks she's too good for public transport. Although that is a lesson I think you and your wife need to decide if it's something you make her to do or not (and if it'd worth the arguments which are clearly going to ensue because of that) because at the end of the day the car is legally yours, you can say no at any time you see fit.", "ESH.

She's already gotten somewhere in life.\n\nHer attitude towards people who take public transportation might suck, but she's an adult who can take responsibility for her own actions. If her attitude comes back to bite her later on, that's her problem, not yours.\n\nShe asked for the car because as an adult who makes adult decisions, she chose to drive to pick up her package after a long day at work.

It\u2019s mentally taxing to be on alert at all times, make sure I\u2019m holding my keys so I can use them to defend myself if needed, making sure my safety alert app is working so everyone knows I\u2019m in an Uber and will make it to my destination. There are entire niches dedicated to protecting women from other people where i don\u2019t think men really think about it in the same way. I\u2019ve had times where men have acted yucky towards me on public transportation. Less so on the train, more so on buses. And it has nothing to do with class or status. People behave badly everywhere, from every walk of life. Even walking in my neighborhood at night, I\u2019ve had men acting badly (for example, a dude pulling up next to me and wacking off, come to find he\u2019s done it to many women and police can\u2019t find him) so my husband would rather he walk our dogs or at the very least insists I always carry my mace. \n\nI would rather my child, who has been responsible with my belongings and not abusing the privilege, take my car and have less to worry about.

No matter how snobbish Ellie's comment sounded, a doctor who works multiple 12h shifts, helping people, deserves some comfort on her rare day off.

Shoes are so important to helping recover from those shifts. Every single one of doctor/nurse/hospital employees friends and family have always needed a day or two to recover from hospital work, especially since Covid. Some just sleep for 20 hours after back to back shifts.

Some things may not be easily found in the chart - for example perhaps Mrs. Smith won't take her meds without apple juice specifically... And one of them may be a critical medication.
