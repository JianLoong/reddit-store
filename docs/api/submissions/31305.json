In my family vacations are somewhat frequent because my great aunt has a bunch of condos all around the US and she lets the family use them. I\u2019m currently staying at the one she has in Florida with my grandma (62F) when I overheard her in the living room on the phone with my mom talking about my little brothers (11M) Christmas present which is a plane ticket down to one of the condos my great aunt has. I later confronted her about who all was going and she said my aunt and her family then my mom and brother. I asked her where my invite was (thinking that I was invited) and she told me I wasn\u2019t going and when I asked why she said it\u2019s because no one wants me to come. A little bit of back story as to why I think they don\u2019t want me around is because I have BPD 2 and I have very bad mood swings but I\u2019m on medication for it that my mom controls but refuses to tell me how to refill or even let me do it so I\u2019m currently not on the medication. I\u2019m not too sure if I have a right to be upset since I sort of understand why they don\u2019t want me around but it still hurts knowing my whole family all agreed they didn\u2019t want me to come on a vacation with them like I usually do and I will admit I definitely got very upset and started yelling which probably didn\u2019t help but I was just upset.

It's time to think about more education or vocational training that will let you have a career that lets you support yourself comfortably away from your family of origin.\n\nYou get to pick your partners and your friends, and to build a nuclear family of your own when you're ready.  You get to spend vacations with friends and family you choose as you become self-supporting and self-sufficient.  You get to leave people who don't treat you well in the dust behind you.  \n\nBPD will not prevent any of this from happening.\n\nNTA", "I can see that many of the people responding here have little or no knowledge of BPD. My 30 year old daughter has it and it can be managed but you need appropriate assistance and you\u2019re clearly not getting it.\n\nOne of the worst things that can happen to someone with BPD is to be rejected or excluded by loved ones - it a key trigger for distress. If you\u2019re unmediated and unassisted then you do probably have episodes of anger and distress and I understand that\u2019s hard for other people but they could be part of the solution instead of the problem.\n\nOther aspects of BPD not working in your favour include the intensity of every emotional state. So when you\u2019re fine, you feel so good that there\u2019s no motivation to seek help. But when you feel bad you\u2019re basically paralysed by bad feelings and can\u2019t seek help either. It\u2019s common to also have generalised anxiety which makes asking for help and focusing on problems difficult.\n\nSo having said all of that, your life really could be easier for you if you can get through a couple of steps. Perhaps your grandma can help you.\n\n- get medicated. You\u2019ll be stunned at how much easier the inside of your head can be. It won\u2019t be 100% all of the time but it will be better\n\n- find some online resources about CBT and DBT - these are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Dialectic Behavioural Therapy. They are highly effective in the management of BPD and will help teach you to regulate your behaviour when you become overwhelmed by emotion\n\n- find a support group of some kind, so you can meet and talk to other young people with BPD.\n\nYou can have a happy and productive life and rebuild your family relationships but this will take a bit of time. In the interim, you ARE a worthy and worthwhile person who deserves love. And I think your family does love you but they just don\u2019t know how to give you what you need.

I wasn\u2019t allowed to know the kid had an appointment, let alone make one.  I had to show proof that I had paid full price for appointments that the kid ditched\u2026 and insurance didn\u2019t cover as a result.

That's stealing.", "Here\u2019s a basic explanation from Wikipedia: \n\nIn cognitive psychology, a schema is an organized pattern of thought and behavior. It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information. In schema therapy, a schema specifically refers to an early maladaptive schema, defined as a pervasive self-defeating or dysfunctional theme or pattern of memories, emotions, and physical sensations, developed during childhood or adolescence and elaborated throughout one's lifetime.[4] Often they have the form of a belief about the self or the world.[4] For instance, a person with an Abandonment schema[5] could be hypersensitive (have an \"emotional button\" or \"trigger\") about their perceived value to others, which in turn could make them feel sad and panicky in their interpersonal relationships.\nCoping styles are a person's behavioral responses to schemas. There are three potential coping styles. In \"avoidance\" the person tries to avoid situations that activate the schema. In \"surrender\" the person gives into the schema, doesn't try to fight against it, and changes their behavior in expectation that the feared outcome is inevitable. In \"counterattack\", also called \"overcompensation\", the person puts extra work into not allowing the schema's feared outcome to happen. These maladaptive coping styles (overcompensation, avoidance, or surrender) very often wind up reinforcing the schemas.[6] Continuing the Abandonment example: having imagined a threat of abandonment in a relationship and feeling sad and panicky, a person using an avoidance coping style might then behave in ways to limit the closeness in the relationship to try to protect themself from being abandoned. The resulting loneliness or even actual loss of the relationship could easily reinforce the person's Abandonment schema. Another example can be given for the Defectiveness schema: A person using an avoidance coping style might avoid situations that make them feel defective, or might try to numb the feeling with addictions or distractions. A person using a surrender coping style might tolerate unfair criticism without defending themself. A person using the counterattack/overcompensation coping style might put extra effort into being superhuman.[7]\nModes are mind states that cluster schemas and coping styles into a temporary \"way of being\" that a person can shift into occasionally or more frequently.[8] For example, a Vulnerable Child mode[5] might be a state of mind encompassing schemas of Abandonment, Defectiveness, Mistrust/Abuse and a coping style of surrendering (to the schemas).\nIf a patient's basic emotional needs are not met in childhood, then schemas, coping styles, and modes can develop.[9] Some basic needs that have been identified are: connection, mutuality, reciprocity, flow, and autonomy.[9] For example, a child with unmet needs around connection\u2014perhaps due to parental loss to death, divorce, or addiction\u2014might develop an Abandonment schema.\nThe goal of schema therapy is to help patients meet their basic emotional needs by helping the patient learn how to:\n\nheal schemas by diminishing the intensity of emotional memories comprising the schema and the intensity of bodily sensations, and by changing the cognitive patterns connected to the schema;\nreplace maladaptive coping styles and responses with adaptive patterns of behavior.[10]\n\n\u2014-\n\nThere\u2019s also a book, Reinventing Your Life, that is basically self help through it.
