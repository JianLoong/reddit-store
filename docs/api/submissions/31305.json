In my family vacations are somewhat frequent because my great aunt has a bunch of condos all around the US and she lets the family use them. I\u2019m currently staying at the one she has in Florida with my grandma (62F) when I overheard her in the living room on the phone with my mom talking about my little brothers (11M) Christmas present which is a plane ticket down to one of the condos my great aunt has. I later confronted her about who all was going and she said my aunt and her family then my mom and brother. I asked her where my invite was (thinking that I was invited) and she told me I wasn\u2019t going and when I asked why she said it\u2019s because no one wants me to come. A little bit of back story as to why I think they don\u2019t want me around is because I have BPD 2 and I have very bad mood swings but I\u2019m on medication for it that my mom controls but refuses to tell me how to refill or even let me do it so I\u2019m currently not on the medication. I\u2019m not too sure if I have a right to be upset since I sort of understand why they don\u2019t want me around but it still hurts knowing my whole family all agreed they didn\u2019t want me to come on a vacation with them like I usually do and I will admit I definitely got very upset and started yelling which probably didn\u2019t help but I was just upset. AITA??\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about why exactly I can\u2019t get control of the meds is because my mom won\u2019t give me my insurance information and obviously I\u2019m not on my own insurance but I\u2019ve been trying to get the info :).\nEdit 2: I\u2019m taking your guys advice and I will be getting ahold of my pharmacy when I get home this coming week!", "created_utc": 1700414762, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17z237z/aita_for_getting_upset_after_my_family_planned_a/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
