In my family vacations are somewhat frequent because my great aunt has a bunch of condos all around the US and she lets the family use them. I\u2019m currently staying at the one she has in Florida with my grandma (62F) when I overheard her in the living room on the phone with my mom talking about my little brothers (11M) Christmas present which is a plane ticket down to one of the condos my great aunt has. I later confronted her about who all was going and she said my aunt and her family then my mom and brother. I asked her where my invite was (thinking that I was invited) and she told me I wasn\u2019t going and when I asked why she said it\u2019s because no one wants me to come. A little bit of back story as to why I think they don\u2019t want me around is because I have BPD 2 and I have very bad mood swings but I\u2019m on medication for it that my mom controls but refuses to tell me how to refill or even let me do it so I\u2019m currently not on the medication. I\u2019m not too sure if I have a right to be upset since I sort of understand why they don\u2019t want me around but it still hurts knowing my whole family all agreed they didn\u2019t want me to come on a vacation with them like I usually do and I will admit I definitely got very upset and started yelling which probably didn\u2019t help but I was just upset.

It's time to think about more education or vocational training that will let you have a career that lets you support yourself comfortably away from your family of origin.\n\nYou get to pick your partners and your friends, and to build a nuclear family of your own when you're ready.  You get to spend vacations with friends and family you choose as you become self-supporting and self-sufficient.  You get to leave people who don't treat you well in the dust behind you.  \n\nBPD will not prevent any of this from happening.\n\nNTA", "I can see that many of the people responding here have little or no knowledge of BPD. My 30 year old daughter has it and it can be managed but you need appropriate assistance and you\u2019re clearly not getting it.\n\nOne of the worst things that can happen to someone with BPD is to be rejected or excluded by loved ones - it a key trigger for distress. If you\u2019re unmediated and unassisted then you do probably have episodes of anger and distress and I understand that\u2019s hard for other people but they could be part of the solution instead of the problem.\n\nOther aspects of BPD not working in your favour include the intensity of every emotional state. So when you\u2019re fine, you feel so good that there\u2019s no motivation to seek help. But when you feel bad you\u2019re basically paralysed by bad feelings and can\u2019t seek help either. It\u2019s common to also have generalised anxiety which makes asking for help and focusing on problems difficult.\n\nSo having said all of that, your life really could be easier for you if you can get through a couple of steps. Perhaps your grandma can help you.\n\n- get medicated. You\u2019ll be stunned at how much easier the inside of your head can be. It won\u2019t be 100% all of the time but it will be better\n\n- find some online resources about CBT and DBT - these are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Dialectic Behavioural Therapy. They are highly effective in the management of BPD and will help teach you to regulate your behaviour when you become overwhelmed by emotion\n\n- find a support group of some kind, so you can meet and talk to other young people with BPD.\n\nYou can have a happy and productive life and rebuild your family relationships but this will take a bit of time. In the interim, you ARE a worthy and worthwhile person who deserves love. And I think your family does love you but they just don\u2019t know how to give you what you need.
