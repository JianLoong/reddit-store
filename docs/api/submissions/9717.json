Also what\u2019s in them is mostly mass market paperbacks and such, with low resale value.", "i am not at all okay with him stealing from communal libraries\u2014we constantly fight about it and i think it\u2019s disgusting and the lowest form of low.", "i misspoke and neglected to explain that i am not at all okay with him taking books from the community. by supportive i meant financially in helping him get amazon subscriptions and stuff to get off his feet. \n\ni realize how fucking gaslit and used to financial, mental, verbal abuse from him that i am and how ridiculous this all is.", "Yup- The books in those little free libraries are usually mass market paperbacks. He\u2019s not going to find anything of great value to resell.\nI got lucky at thrift shops and such a few times, finding a valuable art book or some thing and reselling it for a profit, but those are few and far between.  He\u2019s just seeing free stuff and hoarding it.", "All the LFL's in our city vanished; like someone STOLE the actual libraries. People like him are awful humans.", "My ex had a thing for ordering off Amazon...just ordering crap that he doesn't need...if that wasn't bad enough he would keep the boxes...he never lived with me..but if he stayed then crap would be delivered to mine...I'd find amazon boxes on top of my wardrobe...on top of my kitchen cupboards...my spare room...I did bin them all...but his flat was full of empty boxes!!!", "he doesn\u2019t and never has paid any rent at all. he claims that he\u2019s doing this for \u201cour future\u201d but nothing actually gets done. he doesn\u2019t have money for a storage unit so i actually rented one for him solely because i want the books out so so badly. he has excuses every single time:(", "I don't understand how people are landing on NTA. She's only concerned about him disrespecting her by filling up her apartment. She's not doing anything to stop him from stealing these books from free libraries for a cheap buck. She doesn't say anything indicating she thinks that's a problem. \n\nThey're both massive assholes.", "And he is using you OP.\n\nSeriously you are with a guy who uses you for a free place to stay, free storage.\n\nThe man takes a charity resource that\u2019s there to help others and particularly children - to try make a profit for himself. He is scummy.\n\nAnd you are worried about the space the books takes up and if you are the AH. . . \nYou don\u2019t ah e a storage problem or a boom problem you have a human sized parasite problem.\n\nGet him out of your home and do not pay for the pleasure of kicking his ass out. You\u2019re lucky not to have him officially leaving there so you don\u2019t need to worry about evictions etc.\n\nAnd report him. What he is doing might not be strictly illegal, but it would certainly get him barred from places with those libraries .", "I\u2019m not at all okay with his \u2018business model\u2019! I think it\u2019s disgusting and morally wrong and I am very, very outspoken about the way he is going about this.  I misspoke in describing my \u201csupport\u201d\u2014 I am supportive financially. He says it\u2019s not illegal and doesn\u2019t care that I don\u2019t like it.", "i hate what he\u2019s doing and that he\u2019s taking from communal places.  i am waking up to how utterly abusive this all is and how gaslit and dissociated from reality i am. you are right.", "Time to come up with an exit plan to get him back in his parents house. I'm so sorry op.", "OP, that's pretty alarming.  Are you sure that this is a healthy relationship for you to be in?", "Make sure to ask your landlord to change the locks if he won\u2019t return any keys.   \n\ud83d\ude4f", "Stand up for your morals and dump his ass then. He's basically a scammer and you're supporting him by not doing anything about it....and actively helping him even with storage and shit. I would never have been even remotely ok with my SO STEALING books from underprivileged people to resell. That's so dishonest, terrible, and speaks volumes to his character.", "It became a horde a long time ago.", "Tbh if he ever does get around to selling them, he's going to be in for a big surprise. Most books aren't worth much and it's unlikely he'd get much of anything. I'm a librarian and I  love books but once they're used, most books have a pretty low monetary value, especially the kind that tend to be placed in little free libraries.", "Report him to police and return the books.\n\nSo far, you've been storing stolen goods and helping him to steal and to hide it.", "So you're so against it that you've feel the best way to make it right is to tell him to store them somewhere else? Wow, what a grand stand against this outrageous behaviour. Never mind taking them all back or handing them in somewhere, just ask him to store is stolen property elsewhere. Good thing you've paid for the thief to store his stolen goods elsewhere, that's a great course or action.", "Why are you with someone who you consider to be the lowest form of low?", "OP, I don't get it.  What is going on that you value yourself so little that you remain in this relationship?\n\nI can't say what it is, only you can figure that out but you should 100% focus on that. \n\nDo NOT allow one more book enter your apartment. \nIf you continue to allow him in your apartment (please don't) he needs to have a box of books with him each time he leaves and those books can go wherever he wants (preferably back to a little library) except your storage unit. He gets until the end of the month then you need to stop paying.", "Well, that\u2019s good you realize it. Now he and his hoard need to GTFO of your apartment. NTA.", "Ok, it's a relief really thay you don't like his behaviour nor believe what he is doing is ok.  Frankly, from an outsider's perspective about his \"business model\" this bloke is just not a very nice person. Not in a \"he's a bit misguided and needs to learn and grow up a bit\" kind of way. In a \"he is a user\" kind of way.  He will take advantage of everyone and anyone in life, and that is something you are going to have to put up with for however long you stay with him.\n\nHe will not care who he hurts, because in his head, there is nothing wrong with the things he does - he can, and will continue to twist semantics to excuse or justify his actions.\n\nIf you are able to recognise this now,  maybe it is the time to ask yourself some really hard questions about the future of your relationship with someone who behaves like this.", "No offense but doesn\u2019t sound like this guy has much going for him. Have y\u2019all been together long?I don\u2019t get how selling used books is going to pay off or be profitable to the rate that any of the effort  is worth it , ya know things like Amazon are big nowadays for a reason. Kinda curious how long he\u2019s been unemployed and how long you\u2019ve been paying for a 40 year old man\u2019s lifeWhich from the sounds of it strictly consists of living with you, and then stealing community books? What does he do when you work, and if he\u2019s got no money why not start trying to sell them now.  All sounds a bit mad", "Yes! Good! You are worth so much more than this! Seriously I am rooting for you so much right now. You sound awesome and strong and patient and supportive and you deserve to be with someone who will put as much in to a relationship as you will. I know ending a relationship is hard but you can do it! I believe in you!", "Excuse me??\n\nNope, it's time for ultimatum. Either he starts paying rent or he's GONE. It sounds like the only thing he brings to the table is the sheer audacity.", "Sorry, but this relationship is already dead. You just haven\u2019t acknowledged that fact.\n\nHe and his book hoard are gone, end of story.", "Wait....you pay all the rent and now rent for a storage space?  No...No...No!  First, cancel the storage rental.  Second, set a date for boxes/books to be out of YOUR apartment.  Third, when this doesn't happen, start taking the boxes to your local library and telling them to donate them (even back to the Little Free Libraries).  He has a job, no?  Obviously, you'll have to do this when he's out.  Oh, and while he's out, working or stealing books (because, yes, this is theft), have the locks on the apartment changed.  You may have to have management help you here, but you really, REALLY need to make sure you put a stop to this.  At this point, YOUR apartment is a FIRE TRAP!  If management sees this, they may evict you!  Please, for your own safety.  And really, you don't really see \"a future\" here, do you?", "I mean this in the nicest way, but your SO sounds  mentally ill. I\u2019m also seriously side eyeing him for STEALING all those books then intending to sell them for profit. I don\u2019t think he is a good, or well, person. \n\nNTA, but ya\u2019ll need to break up.", "You are 32 years old now. You can\u2019t be wasting time with a loser of this magnitude. \n\nEvery moment you waste with this man is preventing the man you should be with from entering your life.", "yeah no, that\u2019s not the case at all. i hate all of this and expressed how disgusting and wrong i feel this is\u2014it simply didn\u2019t matter; he kept going anyway.  i have experienced so much abuse and trauma living with him that i\u2019ve been in some level of  dissociated on a regular basis. thank you for your feedback.", "It's okay if you don't have reading comprehension, but you don't have to embarrass yourself like this", "...I feel like it's a bit hair-splitting to say, \"Oh, I don't approve of this at all, but I am still going to allow my apartment to be used to store the books indefinitely as well as pay for a storage unit for the books, and I do hope he succeeds at this reselling business.\" I stand by my original NTA, but there just doesn't seem to be as much of a distinction here as I think you think there is.", "Well you're with someone without a moral compass. Behavior is consistent.  Is this the person you want to be with? I apologize if I misunderstood your feelings on his \"job\".", "It really sounds like hoarding, and I\u2019m guessing he did that at his parents house too.  He needs to seek treatment, but OP needs to not be part of the equation anymore.", "thank you for bringing this to light with your comment.  it sounds pathetic, but i feel like i don\u2019t have a say over anything because he has never really cared about how his actions affected me or what i thought of him.  he has been an abusive for years and through trauma and dissociation i feel powerless\u2014but it\u2019s time to take agency back and stop being complicit in his bullshit.", "This right here. He doesn't give a toss about the ethics of what he does, nor the people he steals from, the ones he is taking advantage of. What next in his business model - reselling on food from a foodbank?", "thanks for your feedback. i appreciate your uniformed commentary on the state of my moral compass, and encourage you to educate yourself about abusive relationships and complex trauma.", "I don't think they did comment on your moral compass, they stated the person you are with has no moral compass, and questioned whether you really want to be with someone like that.", "oh my bad i misunderstood\u2014 he doesn\u2019t have a\nmoral compass and i don\u2019t want to be with him or in this relationship any more at all. \n\ndespite his abuse (which goes way beyond this), i some how feel guilty about giving up on him. i am the child of an alcoholic and my dad died by s* when i was 25\u2013there are some deep unconscious issues here. i am learning i shouldn\u2019t feel guilty."]}
