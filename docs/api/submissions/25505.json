She picked out most of the furniture for the apartment because I didn\u2019t care what furniture we had. I helped by picking up the furniture from various buyers, helped move it, assemble it, etc.\n\nHowever, there is a chair that I have had since I started college a couple years ago. It was with me in my first year in a dorm and my second year in a different dorm. I want it to stay with me in the apartment. My fiancee does not like the chair. She says it is ugly, has rips, is flimsy, takes up space, and doesn\u2019t fit the aesthetic of the apartment that she worked hard to create. I still like the chair because it works, and I think she is exaggerating about the ugliness/rips/flimsiness/space. It fit in my dorms that were much smaller than our apartment.\n\nThe chair also has sentimental value to me because I have done a lot of important things in this chair over the years. I write a lot for my major, and a lot of the papers I wrote were done in the chair. It is also very comfortable, and I like to sit in it to relax.\n\nWe have argued for hours about this. She is very adamant that we should get rid of it. I am very adamant that we should keep it. AITA for refusing to give up my chair?\n\n[EDIT: Here is a picture of the chair](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/732410463698157650/1144774973341311025/IMG_3559.jpg)\n\nEDIT 2: A couple things: My fiancee is great. I love her. She just really hates my chair.\n\nI am willing to compromise by moving the chair to the bedroom or covering the chair with a blanket when it isn't being used.\n\nI don't want to reupholster the chair. I like it how it is. It works, and it being the same is comforting to me. I also don't want to spend money on the chair when I think it works how it is.\n\nEDIT 3:  Another reason why the chair is so important to me is that I was in it when I decided to go vegan, which is a really important part of my life. I was in it when I watched dominion for the first time and learned how cruel factory farming is. It was a really powerful experience that changed my life.", "created_utc": 1693001212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161crtk/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_chair/", "score": 454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those memories are almost as flimsy as this garbage chair.\n\n[Read this old aita post, because you sound just like this dude.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sgln7w/aita_for_yelling_at_my_girlfriend_for_throwing)", "Of course I would let him choose a chair that doesn't look like a sweat rag straight out of the locker room! We chose all of the other furniture together. His parents gave us their couch, he kept his old desk chair. I'm not picky, I just hate repulsive things. The only furniture that we bought \"new\" was our desks, my desk chair, and our bed set. Everything was either thrifted or a hand-me-down.", "BuT hE wEnT vEgAn In ThAt ChAiR", "Wait, it's broken and he still wants to keep it?", "But it's broken", "Depends on what her idea of a \u201creplacement\u201d chair is imo. \n\nIs she going to let him get something HE genuinely likes and wants to use (even if, yes, it\u2019s another cheap $20 chair) or one that fits her \u2018aesthetic\u2019?", "It's a broken piece of junk after only two years. It's a terrible chair, even compared to other cheap chairs.", "And watched *Dominion* in it!", "It just officially died. It gave out when he decided to sit in it. He suggested that we both sit in it together to prove how strong it was and when I simply LEANED it fell apart.", "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only person who had this thought.", "And thus the saga came to a happy ending.", "You\u2019re so brave for even leaning on it", "Lol I live the ending to this.\n\nI have an old leather chair from college that my wife hates.  It lives in tye basement for the dog to sleep on and I wouldn't dream of having it out and about haha.\n\nIf it works with the decor get your boy a poang.  Great chair, looks nice, comfortable, and you can wash/replace the cushion.", "Buddy... I hate to do this, but it's just a chair. Things come and go. Everything in your life has a limited lifespan. The chair's life is over. It had a great run, and was with you for some important milestones in your life. Honor that memory, take some commemorative photos, and say goodbye. It's time to let her rest.", "Info: Did you express to your partner that you wanted to keep the chair at any point? If you expressed it, was that before or after you chose to not participate picking furniture because you didn't really care? Who is or has paid for most of the furniture?  \n\n\nHonestly I'd lean more towards YTA mostly because I find it hard to understand such a sentimental attachment to something you've only owned for 2 years after you already gave up decorating power. If it was so important it would have been something she likely already knew would be coming with you to the new apartment (did she?). Additionally, as other people mentioned, if you already noted you didn't care about the furniture and IF she is paying for the furniture, I'm more inclined to feel she has free reign over aesthetics. Now if she told you, you couldn't keep X important item you've had since you were 3, I think it would seem/feel different then a chair you've had for 2 years.   \n\n\nMaybe a good compromise is going and picking out a loveseat or something together so that you can have memories and sentimental value from something you and your partner share for the future.", "NAH but dude, a chair is a BIG thing to make your comfort item. Take an artsy photo of the chair and frame it. Done. This is not the hill to die on and I agree with your girlfriend it's not a great looking chair and sounds like it broke anyway.", "This is the real life equivalent of Bruno Kirby's wagon wheel coffee table in When Harry Met Sally but with an added \"vegan is my identity\" layer", "That chair is disgusting and should go to the dump. It\u2019s a fucking chair ffs.", "Yes it is very ugly.  I believe keeping it is a compromise your gf should make.  I think your compromise is to cover it either permanently or when you are not using it with a fitted textile that fits the style of the apartment. By fitted I mean probably a cover with elastic around the edge so there is not excessive cloth hanging on the floor.", "It's your living space too. NTA.", "it's not just your apartment, let the man have his chair, why does your wants take priority?", "Relationships are all about compromise, you\u2019ve been able to choose all the furniture in the flat, all he wants is one chair. It\u2019ll be fine with something thrown over it.", "Maybe there IS a higher power.", "I can smell the chair through the screen after seeing the picture and know exactly what went down in it \ud83e\udd22", "Yup, I was just about to say that the chair has seen some things...", "I thought you said you liked it!\n\nI was being nice!\n\n \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05", "It actually broke, see wife's update", "The only throw I approve of is a throw into a dumpster.", "OP updated on the comments that the chair bit the dust after they both sat in it.", "It is!

The picture was ooof-worthy.", "It's enough of a deal for him to ask total strangers on the Internet for advise.\n\nAs someone who went from a wonderful, everything working great long-distance relationship to a pretty shitty and soon over living together relationship in the past: Don't think your long-distance experience transfers so easily. You guys have to do the whole setting up a relationship thing again. Everything has changed. Before it was your (singular) place and his place, and now it is your (plural) place. It seems that you both have not yet fully grasped that.", "I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t try to keep the toilets from the dorm too.., probably had plenty of epiphanies sitting on them as well.", "That looks like it smells so bad too.", "Nope. It doesn't matter if it's ugly. It's important to him. How would you feel about getting replaced by someone more attractive?", "He would.", "No way will anyone grab it from the curb for their own use. That chair is so worn out even the trash collection service will leave it by the dumpsters.", "He didn't seriously come on here for advice. Just to see what the consensus would be. We literally laughed when we saw the post reach 100k views lol. It was a small, petty thing. At the end of the day we're very happy and lucky to have each other. We've never fought. This is actually our first argument, not fight.

Ridiculous how many people are on that side", "lol so embarrassing", "It's because you loved and spent a lot of time in it that it looks that way. Be appreciative of the service it gave and let it go. If you want to give it a new life, put it on the sidewalk with a \"free\" sign and it will be gone within minutes to someone who needs a chair."]}
