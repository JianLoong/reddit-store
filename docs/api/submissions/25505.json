She picked out most of the furniture for the apartment because I didn\u2019t care what furniture we had. I helped by picking up the furniture from various buyers, helped move it, assemble it, etc.\n\nHowever, there is a chair that I have had since I started college a couple years ago. It was with me in my first year in a dorm and my second year in a different dorm. I want it to stay with me in the apartment. My fiancee does not like the chair. She says it is ugly, has rips, is flimsy, takes up space, and doesn\u2019t fit the aesthetic of the apartment that she worked hard to create. I still like the chair because it works, and I think she is exaggerating about the ugliness/rips/flimsiness/space. It fit in my dorms that were much smaller than our apartment.\n\nThe chair also has sentimental value to me because I have done a lot of important things in this chair over the years. I write a lot for my major, and a lot of the papers I wrote were done in the chair. It is also very comfortable, and I like to sit in it to relax.\n\nWe have argued for hours about this. She is very adamant that we should get rid of it. I am very adamant that we should keep it. AITA for refusing to give up my chair?\n\n[EDIT: Here is a picture of the chair](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/732410463698157650/1144774973341311025/IMG_3559.jpg)\n\nEDIT 2: A couple things: My fiancee is great. I love her. She just really hates my chair. \n\nI am willing to compromise by moving the chair to the bedroom or covering the chair with a blanket when it isn't being used.\n\nI don't want to reupholster the chair.

And we tried the blanket and it didn't fix anything. It hung too close to the ground and didn't sit right. He's had his computer for longer.", "He\u2019s had it 2 years. This isn\u2019t an emotional attachment. This is a mental game he\u2019s playing.", "But she didn\u2019t agree to that tradeoff. He opted out of having opinions about the other furniture; that doesn\u2019t make him entitled to that one chair as if he actually gave up something else in exchange.", "Because it's literal trash and the op is the one who doesn't want to do those things", "I mean\u2026I\u2019m all for history but no one loves it that much lol", "I don't think it's about the chair, man. We've seen the chair. The chair is not worth this.", "So let\u2019s say you got him some little gift last year that you put a lot of thought into. By your logic, it\u2019s only been a year, he couldn\u2019t have any attachment to it, so he should just get rid of it right?  \n\nTime is not the only thing that makes sentimental attachment. \n\nYou want unilateral control over the living space and he just does what you tell him right? You are a horrible selfish human. The chair won\u2019t last long, he won\u2019t repair it, let it die it\u2019s natural death under his ass on some random Thursday afternoon and he\u2019ll mourn it, won\u2019t resent you.  Have a little funeral for the chair to show that you actually care about him.. and then choose a chair together that fits the rest of the aesthetic.\n\nBut for now, back the hell off and let the man have his fucking chair.", "Exactly. It\u2019s not like they negotiated this trade-off. He opted out of the rest and is trying to assert that this means he should get to not compromise on this chair. But she never agreed to that deal, or wanted him to opt out otherwise.\n\nOP, you don\u2019t get to give away points you don\u2019t want and claim that this means you\u2019re entitled to the ones you do.", "That changes the solution - because it sounds like your concern/complaint then is you would've got rid of if you could recline in the desk chairs.\n\nGet a new one. Invest in a comfy chair that isn't falling to bits and you actually love and will last for more than the two years you've had this one.\n\nA comfy chair that's yours to chill in, wind down, relax, and doesn't trigger a breakup\n\nYou don't even sound that attached to it.\n\nReplace it with a new relax chair, my guy. Your body also won't be getting proper support in this, so your spine will be happier too.", "Yeah, I would die on this hill then. She gets 99% of the design choices. If she can't live with this one thing you're willing to hide that's wildly unreasonable. \n\nYou're a partner not an NPC for her perfect house.", "It looks dirty though. It\u2019s like looking at an unwashed homeless person in torn clothing. \n\nYou\u2019re saying the dirtiness can\u2019t be cleaned out if it? Ugh gross", "You always this stubborn?", "as long as nothing she deems unsightly passes beneath her regal gaze, I guess", "I vote it depends the most on how flimsy it's become.  The metal rods can break over time if someone isn't careful, and somehow I suspect a college chair hasn't been the most taken care of", "It could be covered with a blanket, she just isn't happy with that solution.", "I dunno, from the comments it seems like she wanted to. I could be wrong but some people do like doing that stuff. The ones who don't are also less likely to be arguing about it.", ">refusing all attempts to improve it or salvage it\n\nExcept he hasn't. He's said he's fine covering it with a blanket or putting it in a different room, numerous times. He has been weirdly reluctant to accept some of her other solutions, but he has offered some options.", "Please op let her replace it\ud83d\ude02 it could be the same style! Just functional and not looking like it sat on the curb for a month", "I feel like from your other comments you've already invested too much into this mentally. It sounds like he finds decorating boring and didn't want to do it and left it to you, but then suddenly wants a say and counts the time he didn't want to have a say as the reason why he gets the final say now.\n\nHe either needs to redecorate a room to fit the chair or he has to accept your unpaid mental labor of decorating the apartment. One off tasks of picking things up from the store don't live rent free in your head like designing a living space does.\n\nAlso, if it doesn't fold anymore and is a 'folding chair' then it's broken and thus needs to be replaced or repaired. If he doesn't want a replacement or a repair job done, put it away under the bed or something. If there are other seating arrangements available in the apartment he will eventually get 'sentimentally' attached to those once it's too much of a hassle to get the broken chair out to use and then put back once he's done.", "Yeah, given that the chair is so flimsy you can't even fold it to move it anymore?  It's broken.  It's a few steps from collapsing under someone, and that is dangerous enough that I'd just chuck it.", "Relationships are about compromise. I\u2019ve had the equivalent of that chair in my living room for 5 years (along with some ugly mirrors). I don\u2019t like my husband\u2019s decor choices, he does. Neither of you are right. We compromise to share our lives together.", "Agreed!", "Oh. OP. It is bad.  I am so sorry. I understand sentimental value but that poor chair is begging to go chair heaven.  And this comes from a woman who never wants to throw anything away. Please let your GF cover it or buy it cushions or do something to hide it.", "NAH. I get it\u2019s sentimental but it\u2019s also gross. That\u2019s a messed up chair.", "That belongs in a basement, game room, or folded up in a closet, and pulled out when you need an extra set...   \nMaybe invest in a chair cover if you want it more in the open... Your new wife might be able to find something that will be ok...\n\nYTA - you should find something else from your bachelor days & get a new chair OP...", "Well wait it out. Eventually the chair WILL break!", "Which makes it seem like a power struggle that isn\u2019t about the chair. \n\nEspecially that beseeching \u201cI love you please let me keep my chair\u201d\u2026which to me sounds kind of manipulative even if that wasn\u2019t his intent. \n\nOP, this isn\u2019t some narrative where your overbearing gf wants everything on her terms. The chair is bad. It\u2019s cheap and bad. Let it go or make it into a cushion", "Why is a throw and pillows not a possible solution?", "\u201cHad it since college\u201d HE IS STILL IN COLLEGE!

I see what the fiancee is saying.", "I feel like I can smell that picture. It\u2019s gross.", "He\u2019s still in college! He\u2019s had the chair for two years! Please look at the picture of the chair. Won\u2019t someone think of his spine! (The literal bones, I mean).", "So again, the apartment can only have the things in it you approve of. That\u2019s a terrible way for him to live. It\u2019s not really his apartment, I guess, it\u2019s yours and he should just be grateful you tried to make sure it appealed to him, even if he isn\u2019t allowed to have what he wants there.", "It looks usable with a thin blanket, but I guess that's hard to tell for sure via photos. \n\nMaybe the compromise is that if he fails to cover it back up often enough, it goes, but otherwise he can keep it. That way you aren't tidying up after him, it looks better, and he keeps it.", "He\u2019s being churlish and refusing to compromise in the most minor ways.", "Obviously, the chair is important to him. I get you want your place to be beautiful,  but it also needs to be livable and happy. If it makes him happy, let it go. Eventually,  as someone said, the chair will break, and the problem will be resolved.", "i had a dining room chair i wrote my thesis in. i get it.", "I\u2019m fully on your side with this but I think your best play is to let the chair die its natural death. Like. The amount of time it would take to fix it might be beyond its lifespan.", "Just let him keep it and use it till its unusable/it breaks then he has to throw it away. But he has to only use that chair in the meantime.", "Honestly, the fiancee's probably going to win this fight by attrition.", "Yeah if it's actually dangerous to use then it should go, but if it were that bad one of them probably would have said.", "Honestly I\u2019d agree with you on the last bit if the chair in question wasn\u2019t on its last leg (sorry to OP if they see this but you gotta admit it looks like it came from a dump)", "If it matters so much to you, you really should cough up the money. Especially if you want it to *last.*", "I definitely think people were expecting something that wouldn't fall to pieces if you looked at it too hard.", "It sounded cringily pathetic and manipulative to me lol", "IT BROKE!!!!!!", "Neither of them are right?? Lol. I get you are trying to be fair. But the chair is literal trash, it\u2019s broken and ugly and probably smells awful. OP needs to take a few pictures of it for memories and then let it go", "My ex and I had a similar taste, I didn\u2019t like everything he already had, but we still made it work. I agree with you there.\nBut in this particular case, the chair is broken and he doesn\u2019t want it to get fixed.  It\u2019s one thing to have items in your house that show signs of aging, that adds to the charm. It\u2019s another thing when it\u2019s apparently flimsy and has tears.", "This seems less about sentimental value of a cheap ripped chair and more about seeing your fianc\u00e9e willingness to compromise on something you say is important to you...\n\nFor everyone saying she decorated the WHOLE place and won't let him have *one* chair... I would personally be more willing to compromise had my fiance not allowed me to invest so much in getting the space a specific way just for him to be like LOL but I'm keeping this ripped up chair", "You\u2019re not in college anymore.  Time to grow up.  It\u2019s an ugly, cheap chair.  Let it go.  You\u2019ll still have your memories.", "I think if you keep the cheap ugly chair you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use any of the nice furniture. It\u2019s the only chair you can use in the apartment, since it\u2019s so important to you. \nAnd it needs to be folded up and put away whenever you are not using it.", "This is a great dorm chair. Do you have a younger sibling. Cousin. Or friend living in the dorms who would be able to make use of it?", "Keep it then, although it's was only for 2 years, it still hold valuable memories", "Claiming sentimental value on it is silly, anyway\u2014 he\u2019s only had that chair for two years!", "Made look nice or barely tolerable lol", "IT BROKE!!!!", "If there's a power struggle it's the girl not being able to handle only having 99% of the place exactly how she wants it and trying to run over the one thing the guy wants to keep.", "I don\u2019t. There\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t have something he likes in his home. So what if it\u2019s ugly?

His spine deserves better.", "He's only had it for 2 YEARS he has had his computer for longer than that thing. He is sizing it up so much, he only used it when I suggested we toss it. At the end of the day I'm the one who cleans and maintains the apartment.", "Babe I was with you but did you see the chair?", "We don't have thin blankets and like I said he refuses to let me invest in this.", "It's a very livable apartment. I made sure to not only make the apartment pretty, but also make it super cozy. This chair is not nearly as cozy as our couch and his desk chair. I will say that it's life is over soon, but it's just annoying to have around.", "I mean yeah, it probably will break soon anyway, so they might as well just wait it out.", "A win is a win\ud83d\ude0c", "For some people (my husband) semi-broken and not aesthetic is fine/preferred.

Look, I get it-it\u2019s ugly, and worn out, but\u2026it\u2019s important to your fianc\u00e9. Why are you so insistent that he HAS to get rid of it right this moment? This is someone you allegedly love, right? This is a chair, not an ex-girlfriend. Let him hang onto this monstrosity until he\u2019s ready to let it go. \n\n\nIs \u201cthe aesthetic\u201d THE most important thing here? \n\nESH, because this is a stupid hill to die on.", "Have you looked at it? It's past \"ugly\" to \"disgusting\". You can literally see what I'm fairly sure are sweat stains on it? I'd bet money the fabric has that vaguely greasy feel that cheap decor fabric gets after seeing hard use for a few years. As another commenter said, I feel like I can smell that picture.\n\nIf this were just a matter of tastes being different, that would be something you'd expect them to compromise on, and I'd be siding with OP. Problem is, this is not a matter of taste. This is a matter of not wanting a slowly decomposing biohazard of a chair in your house.", "I mean. Welcome to living with other people. \"She hates it\" is a reason not to keep it, just like \"I love it\" is a reason TO keep it. He doesn't trump her, and vice versa. But this is a $20 chair that doesn't really have any merit other than his attachment to it and it probably isn't going to last much longer, anyway. And he doesn't want to let her try and do something to make it look better. His only solution is to throw a blanket over it while it's not in use. Like... He's ASKING us if he's the AH in this scenario. The partner who is the least willing to work it out usually gets the AH title.", "People are allowed to have an emotional attachment to ugly things. If somebody threw away my ugly warped tiny bookshelf i would be devastated.", "Okay, then use a thicker one and make him responsible for keeping it on the chair, like I suggested.", "Do you guys have shared finances? If not, just go buy whatever you feel will make the chair less of an eye sore. It's unfair of him to demand the chair and refuse any ways of making it better. And he can't just ban you from buying a dang throw pillow or cover.", "He's said in several comments that he's open to covering it with a blanket. You're good with crafts, if your comments are anything to go by. Measure the (ugly) chair, figure out what size throw you'd need to cover it, and then find or make a throw in the proper size, just for the chair. Toss it over the chair when he's not actually sitting in it.\n\nAnd when, eventually, it falls apart when he sits on it, he'll get rid of it and it won't be a problem any more.", "I get it, I had deer head trophies in my LR for 8 years.

Lots of all-nighters studying/writing papers. It has been with me through my entire college experience so far. I'm an introvert, so I've spent most of my time at college inside a dorm, and a lot of that time was in this chair.", "Why would she want that in her bedroom?", "Is your unwillingness to part with the chair maybe really attached to other feelings?

But big changes can be subconsciously scary.", "Then get off Reddit and go buy one.", "You'd put that thing in your bedroom? It'd give me bad dreams.

I get it doesn't fit with the aesthetic you've set up, but is this argument really worth it?\n\nHe was okay with picking everything out and decorating how you wanted. He helped move it all and set it up. This is one chair that he likes and has had for years. Sure, you can call silly to have an attachment to it, but it's the something he wants in what is also his home. I doubt it's the only thing he wants or picked, but the way the post is worried and the way you've been speaking makes it seem that way. Is it so hard to let him have this?", "Reddit will just keep tearing him a new one lol"]}
