You just have to talk about it before hand to determine if the pizza can be held without the crust (is it a mess of grease?), or does someone eat the pizza to a point and then cut the crust off below the bite marks. But a lot of pizzas can be eaten without the crust if you expect it to not have crust", "That sounds like my cousin as a kid...\nShe wouldn't eat the cheese or any crust that touched the sauce because she didn't like tomatoes or anything made with tomatoes, not even ketchup.

We\u2019ve only been dating a month so it\u2019s the first time I ate pizza with him. We only finished about half, and then we went to watch TV. I was still hungry, so I ate all the toppings off the pizza. \n\nWhen he saw, he absolutely flipped out. He said that he was saving it for lunch tomorrow, that he had never met anyone who would do anything like this, and was just generally really upset. I thought he was joking and laughed it off, but it\u2019s been a couple hours and he is still upset. He\u2019s talking about how he was looking forwards to having the leftover pizza for lunch, and now I\u2019ve ruined his lunch.\n\nI offered to buy him another pizza, but he kept saying that it wasn\u2019t about that, and I just ruined his day. \n\nIs he overreacting or AITA?", "Thank you.
