Also, get cameras or similar?\n\nWeird about the petition thing, never heard of people getting leeway with the council/housing association like this? Lists/waiting times vary from council to council, I had *slight* leeway in that I was in supported living accommodation and when put onto the housing register, they agreed I could be slightly picky about where I bid for places in South norfolk and not just anywhere in order to have support system nearby/public transport (as in, not taking longer than an hour by car to other side of the city/more than 3 buses).", "Report him.

Actions, meet consequences.", "Report him!!! If you don't and by some miracle they don't end up next to your mother, he will still abuse whoever is unfortunate enough to end up beside them. I am also guessing if they got in and he does intimidate the neighbors he can ruin any chances for her to get housing in the future...guys like that tend to either end up in jail or moving on to the next woman once they ruin everything for the current woman.", "Whether this, makes you an ah irrelevant.

Why increase your mum's fears..", "NTA.\n\nTbh, I don't think a petition isn't going to make any difference. There's a housing crisis and people with greater housing needs other than wanting to live across from her mum and a garden for her kids.

I\u2019d focus more on calming mom down and explaining to her she is perfectly safe to leave her house if this guy does move in.

That is sad she can\u2019t even come and go to her own home.", "YWBTA if you reported him.\n\nNothing in your post gives me any confidence that it would work.
