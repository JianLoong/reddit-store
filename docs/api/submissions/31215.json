White teens disturbing the peace at a party with loud music are more likely to be called troublemakers or hooligans. Their Black peers are more likely to be labeled thugs for the same offense.\n\nBeing taller and larger than someone does not automatically mean they are using their size to try and intimidate someone.

I frankly wouldn't be surprised if the reason the neighbor wants them nearby is so she can keep a better eye on her daughter and grandkids.  \n\nAnd you're right that the police may not intervene for a single incident if it's just a one-off like people yelling over a parking spot outside a grocery store.  But they don't take kindly to harassment if they have reason to think the person being harassed is vulnerable (like an elderly person whose harasser wants to move into a house on her street), AND the harasser knows where she lives and that she lives alone.  \n\nIn my state, the law regarding harassment states that \"a person commits an offense if, with intent to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, or embarrass another, the person...initiates communication and in the course of the communication makes a comment, request, suggestion, or proposal that is obscene; threatens, in a manner reasonably likely to alarm the person receiving the threat, to inflict bodily injury on the person or to commit a felony against the person, a member of the person's family or household, or the person's property....\"  There's a lot to interpret there, but if a panel of judges can interpret flicking your headlights (to warn oncoming traffic that they're approaching a cop car) as part of the right to free speech, then it's not a big leap to say that revving your vehicle with a pedestrian in front of the car could be interpreted as a threat on someone's life.
