It was really good, lol.  My FIL proceeded to shame me for 15 mins about how they would never eat that \"dog food\" and I was an asshole for giving it to their 3 grandkids(my kids).\n\nAlright... so last night my wife said my MIL needs help installing some program and setting it up on her work laptop and they'd be coming by around dinner.  I said let's grab a pizza to eat, which she said sounds great.  In the fridge I had the leftover box from Sunday's takeout pizza we bought on a ride home.  Last slice was stale, and tossed, but the box was in perfect shape.  You can probably see where I'm going with this!\n\nI heated up the Walmart pizza extra hot and put a new square of parchment paper, and loaded the hot pizza on top.  Then sat it on the counter.

Thanks.\"  My reply was \"Yep, picked up a pizza...\" Which is the truth. \n\nWe ate the entire thing, FIL commented how tasty it was, and that was that. I told him \"not bad for dog food, eh?\" He was confused so I told them it was a Walmart store sold pizza that I placed in the box from 3 nights ago. \n\nHe actually laughed, smiled and called me a sneaky SOB.  I'll bet my life he's going to secretly start buying them now.  My MIL and wife had no issue with it at all, but a buddy I told today thinks this was really F'd up and out of line.  He mentioned allergies, which... there are none.  I've known these people 20 years... it's just a pepperoni pizza.  0 allergy risks.  I said it was harmless but he didn't budge, thinks this was highly deceiving and that I got lucky my FIL responded so well.  And that this could have gone worse.\n\nSo.

Two of us used to buy the store brand to save money so we switched the bags in the box and she ate them and commented on how gross ours were (we were eating the \u201creal\u201d ones in the store brand box).

Makes me happy", "NAH. This particular case has nothing to do with allergies\u2026 which I\u2019d assume you know if your in laws had. If your friend/their child had allergies I can understand why they would be concerned. In general changing packaging like that is something an allergy family isn\u2019t going to find entertaining because it can be life threatening. \n\nI hate shopping at my local Walmart. It\u2019s a always horrible experience.

Now if he knew that and went on to lie about it then it would be different.", "I see your viewpoint and i dont disagree entirely but i will say if you have allergies like that, it is your job to question what you are eating as well. My cousin has celiac disease and she would never just eat something that is presented to her. She always has to verify brands and all that. It sucks it limits where she can eat and such. But everyone who knows her, knows that and if she didnt know them she wouldnt blindly eat something like that. So i will stand wit my original standpoint and say Op didnt do anthing wrong", "The altered packaging was used deliberately to lie about where the pizza was from and its composition, as clearly admitted by OP.\n\nMany inmates consider their imprisonment to be an absurd reaction.\n\nLogically and legally, you have no valid point.", "Yeah, but if you can't even trust the packaging it's presented in there's a major issue (again case here isn't awful but out of context could be). I have a lot of issues with different flavorings among other things, meaning that I'm sometimes oddly brand specific. If somebody poured me a drink from a diet coke bottle,  I wouldn't suspect they put off brand in that bottle to prove a point and depending on the off brand I'd really start having issues.", "To add on, if you dont know someone that well then yes you should not do what op did.

The world does not and will not bend to you. Its up to you to ultamitly decide what you take into your body, if you are that sensative (do not mean that in a negative way, im pretty picky when it comes to food myself) then you if you were in this situation should be asking hey where is this from, im allergic to certain foods.

How? Maybe the take out pizza is also not that great, might as well go for the frozen/chill one. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this qualifies me as a snob, I am not even one of the really inflexible Italians, I am fine with pineapple, but this is where I draw the line! :) \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Well played.", "I love this kind of gag.\n\nI had an uncle who loved indie rock but refused to listen to the New Pornographers just because he could not get over the name.  So my brother and I put in a CD with a lot of their catchiest tracks, and played it in the car with my uncle, just mentioning it was this supergroup based out of Vancouver that also included Neko Case.

You owe no one an apology. NTA.", "I was worried how your FIL responded. But looks like you know him better than me. NTA.", "NTA, and your friend needs the stick out of his backside. The fact that the inlaws didn't flip out and appreciated the tastiness was great.\n\nNGL, there are a handful of \"house\" brand items at the WallyWorld that are actually better than the brand name equivalents.

I do comment critically when someone messes with food to slip in an allergen or disliked ingredient. \n\nAll you did was substitute an equivalent. Point made.", "NTA. It's a pizza, not a grand deception. They should be grateful you even fed them!", "NTA  The fact that he laughed tells you all you need to know.  He knows they're snobs.  Good on you!", "Nta. And those pizzas are surprisingly good", "Love the response from FIL! NTA of course.", "Haha! The fact that they look down on others while simultaneously believing target is a high-end store is hilarious. \n#bottomshelfbougie", "NTA. My Grandpa was a massive snob and he used to treat my Mum like a servant because she was working class and thought she was too common for my Dad. He used to demand she go to the market to the cheesemonger to buy his cheese for him because he didn't like the rubbish from the supermarket. My Mum did go to the market a few times but parking was difficult, my Dad was an idle SOB and she had a job and 2 small kids to look after so after a while she decided it was too much effort and it wasn't like my Grandpa was even grateful. So... she started buying standard mass produced cheese at the supermarket every week and taking it out of the plastic and wrapping it in parchment. My grandpa said how delicious it was. She never told him.", "NTA - I was tense and waiting for some massive explosion from the elite and... was shockingly (and pleasantly) surprised at your FIL's even-keeled and accepting response!

They were being ridiculous about food, and I think going to these kind of lengths about it was petty, but they took it in good spirit, all of you sound like decent people. Your friend's allergy concern is weird, though. If allergies were a danger they'd be just as much of one from whichever other place.", "NTA. Slick!", "NTA\n\nYour friend is being super weird by making a big deal out of this.", "ESH. You knowingly lied and then also lied by omission.

Them for saying their biased/classist views to other people.", "NTA for secretly replacing your inlaws pizza with Folgers Crytstals.", "My mom did something similar to my dad when they were younger and just started living together (I was told this story later on in life). My dad used to only eat Jif peanut butter and thought anything else was inedible.

He now buys store brand for most things lol. \n\nNTA.", "Right? I mean Does the friend think they\u2019re actually allergic to Walmart? It\u2019s pepperoni pizza!

It was the water I used \ud83d\ude02 he was used to bottled water for making his coffee and I, trying to be helpful, made him coffee one day using just our tap water(we lived in the country if that matters). He was GUSHING about how good the coffee was and what did I do to make it taste so much better than normal. I said nothin. Just one tablespoon for every two cups like you said and then I filled it up(gesturing to sink). \u201cYou used tap water?\u201d He goes. One sip. Eyes narrowing. Two sips. Puts the cup down and doesn\u2019t take another drink again lol", "In my area Sam\u2019s Club food court is the best deal for pizza.

I avoid Walmart for various reasons but if someone else serves me food from there that\u2019s fine. And when we did thanksgiving with SIL\u2019s family in podunkville, you bet we went to Walmart because it was the nicest grocery store in town.", "I do find that WalMart has a greater quantity of actual unwashed people than most other places.

I don't think she likes pizza much in general.  I don't recall who had how many, but there was 1 slice left in the fridge, when they left.", "Oh I have a similar story too: when my parents first got together my Dad would only drink Mayfield milk, which was fairly significantly more expensive than the store brand.
