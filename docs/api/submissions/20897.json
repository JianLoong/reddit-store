They think shopping at Walmart is where the \"great unwashed\" go, and never for them.  They'll talk about Target like it's some massive step above, despite everyone I know shopping at both stores.\n\nRegardless, a week ago I mentioned in passing that I picked up a few of the store sold deli-chilled pizzas from Walmart, heated them in the oven on our pizza stone and was shocked how good they were, right up to the extra hot grease sitting on top of the pepperoni curling, just like at a Pizza restaurant!  It was really good, lol.  My FIL proceeded to shame me for 15 mins about how they would never eat that \"dog food\" and I was an asshole for giving it to their 3 grandkids(my kids).\n\nAlright... so last night my wife said my MIL needs help installing some program and setting it up on her work laptop and they'd be coming by around dinner.  I said let's grab a pizza to eat, which she said sounds great.  In the fridge I had the leftover box from Sunday's takeout pizza we bought on a ride home.  Last slice was stale, and tossed, but the box was in perfect shape.  You can probably see where I'm going with this!\n\nI heated up the Walmart pizza extra hot and put a new square of parchment paper, and loaded the hot pizza on top.  Then sat it on the counter. They showed up 5 mins later, walked in and he said \"Nice, you grabbed takeout.  Thanks.\"  My reply was \"Yep, picked up a pizza...\" Which is the truth. \n\nWe ate the entire thing, FIL commented how tasty it was, and that was that. I told him \"not bad for dog food, eh?\" He was confused so I told them it was a Walmart store sold pizza that I placed in the box from 3 nights ago. \n\nHe actually laughed, smiled and called me a sneaky SOB.  I'll bet my life he's going to secretly start buying them now.  My MIL and wife had no issue with it at all, but a buddy I told today thinks this was really F'd up and out of line.  He mentioned allergies, which... there are none.  I've known these people 20 years... it's just a pepperoni pizza.  0 allergy risks.  I said it was harmless but he didn't budge, thinks this was highly deceiving and that I got lucky my FIL responded so well.  And that this could have gone worse.\n\nSo. I'll respect the results here and apologize to my inlaws if I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1688052815, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m832v/aita_for_secretly_feeding_my_inlaws_a_store/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is truly one of the most disgusting unorganized stores they've ever been to. Every Target I've ever been to is clean and well organized.", "NTA - first off, Target > Walmart by a mile. Second, good for you. My parents were like that and honest people like that need a reality check. Same shit with when people shop at Aldi, they think it\u2019s \u201cpoor people food\u201d which it\u2019s not.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t even think you were an AH.", "If you are really worried about it, next time you are with the in laws just say something like \u201csorry if that was out of line\u201d and I\u2019m sure they will reassure you you are NTA", "NTA.  You knew there were no allergies or anything health-related that could result from switching out one brand of pizza for another.  And as someone who grew up with a mother who had/has ill-informed preconceptions about SO many things, this is the only way.  I can't tell you the number of things I've opened her eyes to over the years because I've decided she would enjoy them enough that it was worth the effort to out-stubborn her (sushi, Indian food, various tv shows, etc.).", "NTA. My college roommate used to always say Triscuits were good but the store brand equivalent were horrible. Two of us used to buy the store brand to save money so we switched the bags in the box and she ate them and commented on how gross ours were (we were eating the \u201creal\u201d ones in the store brand box). She couldn\u2019t even tell.", "NTA - Regardless of where the pizza was from, if you there was an allergy at play presumably you would know that and not get a pizza that includes the allergen?!", "NAH and it\u2019s actually really refreshing to read a story where your in-laws are laughing and okay with the ending. Makes me happy", "NAH. This particular case has nothing to do with allergies\u2026 which I\u2019d assume you know if your in laws had. If your friend/their child had allergies I can understand why they would be concerned. In general changing packaging like that is something an allergy family isn\u2019t going to find entertaining because it can be life threatening. \n\nI hate shopping at my local Walmart. It\u2019s a always horrible experience. And I too will also go to Target and spend more money over experiencing our Walmart\u2026 but there is nothing wrong with the products they sell just the way the store operates. Your in laws are TA for the extent of their classism but that\u2019s not what this post is about.", "NTA. No harm, no foul. If the in laws were ok with it then no one should be offended.", "Im gonna actually go with NAH here. Everyone actually seems pleasant and reasonable. Even FIL sounds more like someone that just enjoys talking shit more than actually holding genuine hatred against Walmart.", "NTA. Food snobs are the worst. I don't like Walmart as a company, but damn if I won't eat their pizza when I can", "NTA.  You know your in-laws well enough to know that this would be a plausible swap. \n\nMy husband is like that about the Aldi groceries. Except some of the same items are sold at the base commissary and he has bought them from there. I tell him the kids do not care if the crackers are brand or not because their unrefined palates cannot doscern the entire difference.  And given how hollow kids' summer bellies are and the amount of food they consume, we save a lot of money on groceries for them. He doesn't have to eat any of it.", "Hi, I have food allergies, your buddy is a dumbass. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s strange how upset a third party individual got about the situation.

Just know if I serve it on the stone from Walmart, nothing changes.  More being a classist douche. And he wouldn't have touched the pizza.", "To be fair to op though, I think they don't like Walmart and hadn't actually tried the pizza until this happened. It was a bias based on elitism, not experience.", "I get the feeling FIL doesn't give a shit about Walmart employees. Everything OP has actually said ('great unwashed', dog food) points to his objections being truly classist, yes.", "As the OP stated, he's known them for 20 years and would be aware of any dietary restrictions.", "He just said it was a pizza, he didn\u2019t even specify where it was from. If ingredients were a concern they would have asked", "Hi, I have celiac disease. This comes with many food restrictions. I say this to let you know I know what is in food. None of your made up concerns are relevant when comparing a uncooked pizza vs a restaurant pizza.

The friend was was just looking to be offended.", "He had stated he has known these people for 20 years and knows there wasnt any allergies. Plus  its a pretty safe bet that if they had eaten pizza before, that one from walmart is going to magically give them allergies. Obviously the sistuation would be different if it was a different situation but in this case from what op has given us it was safe  and the worst that could of happened would of beem FIL blowing up, which he didnt.", "Except this isn't mislabeling food.\n\nIt's a Walmart pepperoni pizza instead of <restaurant name> pepperoni pizza.\n\nIt would be a different situation if FIL (or MIL) was allergic to something and OP gave them food with the allergen.", "As a former daughter-in-law of assholes, I completely understand.", "And that is his right. Why is everyone on here so cavalier about deceit? Because the consequences were nex to non-existent?\nSry OP, but YTA. Deceit should never be the answer.

And there's definitely cases of stuff being brand specific because people struggle with an ingredient.", "I have a form of IBS, as does about 15% of the population. Walmart deli refrigerated pizza will leave me in extreme pain unable to leave a bathroom for one or several days.\n\nOther low quality pizza, like Domino's, won't cause inflammation of my intestinal lining (without compounding influences).\n\nNot only was this food mislabeled, if it was done to me I would press civil and criminal prosecution.", "Yeah, the case here isn't bad, but I think it's a valid thing to object to on principle because people who don't have (especially rare) allergies keep on making dangerous mistakes all the time. And I know a bunch of cases where people tolerate some brands but can't have others.", "They never asked which pizza place it was from or for an ingredient list. This is an absurd reaction", "I guess for my criminal record, it's a good thing I know my inlaws of 2 decades a lot better than you do!", "Thats on you. If you have that issue you shouldnt be just willy nilly eating whatever is in front of you. Now if he knew that and went on to lie about it then it would be different.", "I see your viewpoint and i dont disagree entirely but i will say if you have allergies like that, it is your job to question what you are eating as well. My cousin has celiac disease and she would never just eat something that is presented to her. She always has to verify brands and all that. It sucks it limits where she can eat and such. But everyone who knows her, knows that and if she didnt know them she wouldnt blindly eat something like that. So i will stand wit my original standpoint ads say Op didnt do anthing wrong", "The altered packaging was used deliberately to lie about where the pizza was from and its composition, as clearly admitted by OP.\n\nMany inmates consider their imprisonment to be an absurd reaction.\n\nLogically and legally, you have no valid point.", "Yeah, but if you can't even trust the packaging it's presented in there's a major issue (again case here isn't awful but out of context could be). I have a lot of issues with different flavorings among other things, meaning that I'm sometimes oddly brand specific. If somebody poured me a drink from a diet coke bottle,  I wouldn't suspect they put off brand in that bottle to prove a point and depending on the off brand I'd really start having issues.", "To add on, if you dont know someone that well then yes you should not do what op did. But if you legit know them pretty well than this is harmless, which i would think in 20 years op would of known if FIL had any allergies", "Not everyone is like that and you would be in the minority that is. The world does not and will not bend to you. Its up to you to ultamitly decide what you take into your body, if you are that sensative (do not mean that in a negative way, im pretty picky when it comes to food myself) then you if you were in this situation should be asking hey where is this from, im allergic to certain foods. I mean if i knew i had a weird reaction with different brands the first thing i would state to someone offering food is info on the food. If they procede to still do it after that then yes they are the asshole.", "Yeah,  unlabeled it's on you, but to distrust the packaging that's actually on or distrusting the info people actively give you when they could just.... Be decent and not lie to your face about it....?  In the case here it's not much of an issue, again,  but mislabeling or mispackaging food is dangerous and disrespectful."]}
