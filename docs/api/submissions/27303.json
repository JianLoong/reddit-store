If that's your \"best\" friend... find a new one.", "Question... when was the last time you were in friends house?", "Not only are you NTA, your \"BF\" is definitely an AH.\n\n\"she wanted to hang out with me and get dinner after the gym\"\n\nThis was her idea, and you graciously offered to pay for her whole family.  That would be the last time I paid for anything for her.", "She\u2019s an Ahole. I would no longer consider her a friend", "NTA. I mean it depends on how big the argument you started was, but probably not the arsehole. I don\u2019t know in what universe a person buys everyone food and then has to eat by themself, that\u2019s clearly not right. \n\nIf she didn\u2019t want to host you in her place that\u2019s fine, but she should\u2019ve suggested eating somewhere else.", "NTA she sounds like a crappy friend.", "NTA but do you often drive when you do things? If so she just wanted to avoid delivery fees. Stop being generous with her. If you go to the gym together, meet her. Don't offer to pay, don't offer to drive her.", "NTA.

Shit- I'd test her too & see if she's really trying to hang out or just using you.", "NTA, This person is not your friend.", "NTA. You bought the food, she should at least offer the place to eat. She just took advantage on you.", "What a weird friend you have.\n\nYNTA", "NTA- she is not a friend to you.", "NTA, weird", "NTA - it sounds from this one experience that your friend is using you.  For money, free rides and isn't considerate about you or your well being.  Maybe time for a friend upgrade?", "NTA. You totally got used for a free meal. I wouldn\u2019t call that a best friend.", "Wtf?? NTA your \u2018friend\u2019 is though. SHE invited YOU, she got free dinner and a free ride. There\u2019s no way id continue being friends with someone like that", "Don't buy your so-called friend any more meals.\n\nShe's a mooch, and very inconsiderate.\n\nNTA. \n\nand she's NOT your friend.", "NTA\n\nThat behaviour is not that of a best friend. More like a mooch.", "NTA - Only because she initially said she wanted to hang out after the gym.  Normally I'd say she is under no obligation to let you inside her home just because you offered to buy her dinner, but the initial offer included spending time with her as well.", "NTA, but something appears to be missing here.", "NTA - she often uses you?", "NTA\n\nwhat she really meant was \u201cbuy my family food and then get lost.\u201d", "Honestly sounds like miscommunication, especially since you were there earlier so no issue with you being at the house. \n\nNta instead of n a h because she reacted poorly", "Unpopular opinion, but ESH. Your friend is an AH for taking the free food and not showing enough courtesy to let you eat with her. You are an AH for insisting on entering her house when she already said no. Just eat it in your car or warm it up at home and remember this the next time she wants to go out for dinner. Maybe tell her it\u2019s her turn to pay.", "Usually I would say she\u2019s the AH but she does have kids who might require (in her opinion) an evening routine where it\u2019s difficult to involve other people. It really depends on the kid\u2018s age obviously! \nI understand that you\u2019re annoyed but also, consider her situation and whether there might be a harmless explanation for her behaviour?", "IDK!  Tie?  This one is hard.\n\nEdit:  leaning more towards your friend, but maybe her house messy\u2026idk", "This guy is trying to win over friend but she has friend zoned him and he doesn\u2019t even know. She\u2019ll call you again when she need something.", "ESH\n\n\nShe lacked decorum. You obviously made it weird being hangry. Let it go and see if she will pick up the tab next time. People get tired having kids and working out, just as muchbas you do working out and driving out of the way. Are you really going to make this a \"thing\"?", "I mean, you probably should have discussed if you\u2019d actually be eating together or if you were just getting her food", "She's not obligated to invite you in/over just because you bought her dinner. She has a right to say she doesn't want the company.\n\nYou offered to buy food. She didn't trick or mislead you into it. Maybe next time verbalize your full intent first?\n\nDo you not own a microwave? You don't HAVE to eat cold food.", "Unpopular opinion- Maybe she was just tired and wanted you to go home. It's not that big of a deal. My bff never comes in my house for a quick minute. You come in and sit down. Now you have to chit chat. She still has the nighttime routine for the kids to eat, bathe, go to bed, and get ready the next day. Your day ends with dinner and a drive home. \n\nSo, ESH. She was kind of inconsiderate, but you were kind of inconsiderate as well. Eat a few bites before driving home. It's only 20 minutes.

She rook the money and ran.", "She\u2019s the one who reached out wanting to hang out after the gym. So maybe she shouldn\u2019t initiate that and then refuse to spend anytime with the person she asked to hang out.", "Did you miss the part where he says she\u2019d said let\u2019s have dinner after and hang out?

I\u2019ve also had certain times where I find myself suddenly wiped out. I probably would have given OP money for my food if I knew she was expecting to stay. Either way, bowing out early, especially if it\u2019s not a regular thing, is fine. I\u2019d have thought getting dinner \u2018together\u2019 meant eating at a restaurant - not having her come back to mine.", "Well, you don't put it as, \"let's hang out at the gym then have dinner after\" if you're gonna just ask to be dropped off then tell them to go home. Creates a false expectation. Only way she isn't the AH is if OP misinterpreted what she said originally", "This. I had a friend years ago that would make up all kinds of excuses. Home was disgusting. Nta op it sounds like your friend has some reason to not want you in the home and it\u2019s nothing to do with you.", "I can definitely understand that, but then why suggest to have dinner with OP in the first place if they knew they weren't going to feel comfortable letting them in? It's fine to have a messy house, not fine to have OP buy them and the kids food, just to be told to leave. NTA OP, cut this person off.", "Oh, yeah, the place being a mess is the sane explanation for this dumb mistake. So OP is NTA but I'd still give the friend another chance. (Though I don't think I'd offer to spring for dinner again soon if there's a chance that I am just buying them groceries and not having dinner together)", "Been there with the embarrassing home mess. I bet it is this with all them kids.", "The only thing sad would be if you let her do it again she's a user. Let her go! She's a bad person. She is. You can do better!", "Lmfao aight that makes my thought invalid lmfao\nThat's weird of your friend then... suuuper weird.", "Then she shouldn't have invited OP to get food. Typically when you do that you're not inviting your friend to be your ride to get food separately and then tell them to go home once you got what you wanted", "I\u2019d maybe just stop doing her favors and distance yourself if you have to.", "Sounds like she\u2019s nice to you until she gets what she wants from you and then she\u2019s mean so she doesn\u2019t have to reciprocate the same effort.\n\nShe is emotionally manipulating you to her advantage. Take a break from her and focus on yourself.", "She\u2019s using you, get some self respect and dump the trash.", "You don\u2019t sound sensitive to me. You sound perceptive and communicative and a bit distrustful of your intuition. Which then becomes passivity and denying your needs. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, people can change their minds at any time and that\u2019s fine, but this sounds inconsiderate at best and manipulative at worst.", "Girl, when people show you who you are believe them.", "It's not likely to only be 30 minutes. Why can't the friend just be tired? She just wants to get the kids fed, bathed, and in bed. Maybe she doesn't want to entertain anyone.", "I completely missed the \u201cand hang out after\u201d part. You are absolutely right.", "Uhhh, so its definitely rude but wanting the free food seems like a leap unless she somehow knew OP would offer to pay? Which is possible if OP is always doing this but isn't stated", "If you change your mind, then the least you can do is acknowledge that you\u2019re changing the plan and apologize and pay for your own food. Friend is unquestionably the AH.", "Yeah, it\u2019s a tricky one. Maybe just poor communication", "I guess this seems like a weird scenario to people. My best friend and I often buy each other dinner. It doesn't require me to eat it at her house. We hang out, go home,  and get ready for the next day.", "[deleted]", "Yeah she shouldn't have let her buy them food or hung out at the restaurant, I agree with that but no one is owed entry into someone's house.", "Clearly the house stinks like marijuana and OP is a prude. (jk, lol)", "Yea I was thinking if he\u2019d never been in her house that would change things but yea sounds like she TAH here.", "Or there is something deeper not properly explained here. Probably a much broader discussion.", "Yea, probably as poor as my texting skills.", "If that's your deal in advance then fine but taking back an invitation and making someone drive 20 mins before they get to eat their (now cold) food after they paid for you and your kids meal is very bad manners. She and kids were going to eat anyway, not like she was going straight to bed.", "Then they could have eaten at the restaurant. \n\nHanging out with someone doesn\u2019t always mean hanging out at your home, but it *never* means buy me dinner, act as my Uber, and then get lost.", "Lolololol yup must be", "That applies to every post. We can only work with the information presented.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from, but I still think that would require an explanation. Like, \u201cI know we were meant to get dinner together but the kids are crashing can we do this another time?\u201d Something like that.", "I said the friend was a bit inconsiderate, but it's ok for someone to change their mind. \n\nAnd you are right, the friend was not going straight to bed. In fact, she likely had a few more hours of family work before she actually got to go to bed. \n\nMaybe there's other stuff going on that OP didn't disclose, but I would just go home and talk to my best friend tomorrow. She's tired.", "[deleted]", "Eh... I think people should try harder.", "The other thing we are missing is her side of the story."]}
