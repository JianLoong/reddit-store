I never assume I\u2019m allowed in someone\u2019s house.    It was kind of you to pick up dinner, but this sounds like a miscommunication.

Did OP state before they bought the food that they wanted to eat at their friends house? Or were they originally supposed to eat out together & then someone decided that sinced they worked out the should just get food to go instead & then it snoballed from there?", "Then suggest eating somewhere else? \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick up dinner for us and we can eat at your place!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we eat at yours instead?\u201d", "To be fair, even with my best friends, if my house is a mess, NO ONE is coming inside. Part of it stems from childhood habits, but I've never been comfortable with anyone entering my living space unless it's clean.", "Then she shouldve just ate out with OP- she wanted to hang and have dinner but dipped when OP got them dinner\n\nOr they couldve gone somewhere else and ate or smthing", "She also wanted to hang out together. Now she just wanted to be dropped off and for OP to screw off. That's pretty assholey. OP balking at the sudden change in plans and wanting some time with the friend to still eat dinner -- per original plans -- is not unreasonable before a 20 min drive. Where else were they going to hang out with take out? \n\n> And then not gracefully taking the no? Now awkward.\n\nThat was awkward -- but I'd be pissed in OP's place. And, I mean, this isn't Am I The Awkward. This is Am I The Asshole?", "Than she should have just said that after the gym\u2026", "OP had no obligation to feed those kids.", "Can eat whatever is in the larder at home.\n\nIt's his friends job to feed her kids and have food at home. If she doesn't than the only thing OP needs (and should do) is call CPS, not let himself being used to buy them dinner and than being treated like he's \"trying to force his way into her home\". \n\nI totally understand if she was too tired for more company, I get overwhelmed easily. But than she needed to say so before getting Dinner together that she's done with company and just wants to go home, pay for herself or give him the money back if she changed her mind during the drive home (or at least offer to). This is just exploitative.", "I understand as I have strict almost ocd standards myself but as I commented if this was the reason then she could have been mature and explained it or at least given a bit more detail in why she didn\u2019t want the best friend who picked her up and went to the gym and then stopped to get food for her and her kids to come inside or why she wanted the outing to end as it did. Seems weird.", "I don't think anyone would say OP was wrong to be unhappy since \"let's get dinner together\" does not mean the same thing as \"give me dinner (apart),\" The moocher may not have realized how dumb this was, somehow, and forgiving one absolutely ridiculous thing is just what people tend to do.", "Asshole for feeling miffed?  No.  Everyone is entitled to their feelings.  Asshole if OP can\u2019t take a hint after this yeah, maybe.  //But I was hangry and I lived 20 minutes away // Are you serious?  They\u2019re the AH just for that.  What a baby.  Don\u2019t do nice things with string attached.", "Fair enough. One time is not quite a deal breaker", "OP's friend wanted to get dinner and hang out with OP after the gym. OP was up for that and offered to get dinner. Great. OP and OP's friend do so. Everything's great until OP pays for the food and OP's friend starts separating the food. Well, looks like OP's friend has changed her mind and doesn't want OP around anymore after she's gotten her free dinner for herself and her kids. \n\nOP is entitled to his feelings of being \"miffed\" (ie. ***used*** by a \"friend\") because \"everyone is entitled to their feelings\"? How generous.\n\nEDIT: You know, I get when circumstances change and change quickly where you can no longer host people at home and when plans need to shift because life happens and it sucks. I think how OP insisted on staying is super cringey and it's not a cute, funny, or good look (\"hangry\"). That said and barring the aforementioned circumstances happening, OP's friend is TA and this is a yucky and gross way to treat people."]}
