I never assume I\u2019m allowed in someone\u2019s house.    It was kind of you to pick up dinner, but this sounds like a miscommunication.

Now she just wanted to be dropped off and for OP to screw off. That's pretty assholey. OP balking at the sudden change in plans and wanting some time with the friend to still eat dinner -- per original plans -- is not unreasonable before a 20 min drive. Where else were they going to hang out with take out? \n\n> And then not gracefully taking the no? Now awkward.\n\nThat was awkward -- but I'd be pissed in OP's place.

But than she needed to say so before getting Dinner together that she's done with company and just wants to go home, pay for herself or give him the money back if she changed her mind during the drive home (or at least offer to). This is just exploitative.", "I understand as I have strict almost ocd standards myself but as I commented if this was the reason then she could have been mature and explained it or at least given a bit more detail in why she didn\u2019t want the best friend who picked her up and went to the gym and then stopped to get food for her and her kids to come inside or why she wanted the outing to end as it did. Seems weird.", "I don't think anyone would say OP was wrong to be unhappy since \"let's get dinner together\" does not mean the same thing as \"give me dinner (apart),\" The moocher may not have realized how dumb this was, somehow, and forgiving one absolutely ridiculous thing is just what people tend to do.", "Asshole for feeling miffed?  No.  Everyone is entitled to their feelings.  Asshole if OP can\u2019t take a hint after this yeah, maybe.  //But I was hangry and I lived 20 minutes away // Are you serious?

One time is not quite a deal breaker", "OP's friend wanted to get dinner and hang out with OP after the gym. OP was up for that and offered to get dinner. Great. OP and OP's friend do so. Everything's great until OP pays for the food and OP's friend starts separating the food. Well, looks like OP's friend has changed her mind and doesn't want OP around anymore after she's gotten her free dinner for herself and her kids. \n\nOP is entitled to his feelings of being \"miffed\" (ie. ***used*** by a \"friend\") because \"everyone is entitled to their feelings\"? How generous.\n\nEDIT: You know, I get when circumstances change and change quickly where you can no longer host people at home and when plans need to shift because life happens and it sucks. I think how OP insisted on staying is cringey but the want (and request) to eat per original plans (and quickly) before a long drive is not unreasonable. And what's more, OP changed her mind because she wanted to sleep. She is TA and this is a yucky and gross way to treat people.", "I mean I'd be tired and may not want company after a workout too, but I would DISCUSS THAT first, not just let my friend buy me dinner under the assumption they'd be staying and eating at my place, then kick them out after they'd already paid and given me a ride home... that's what makes the friend TA here, The lack of communication beforehand. I'd sit down and talk to them about that - make it clear that you wouldn't try to force yourself in their home, but this was quite a shock to you and you clearly have different expectations, so going forward you'll be hashing out details like this *before* any offers are put on the table. If friend accepts this, then it really was just an innocent miscommunication. If they fight you on it... then yes, it was an intentional move to take advantage of you.", "Are you sure there wasn't a miscommunication? She said she wanted to hang out with you after the gym, but maybe she meant at a restaurant or at your place. There could be a number of reasons why she doesn't want you to go inside her house.

This chick was just after a free meal for her and her kids. And a free ride. Since you obviously drove and I bet didn't get offered gas money. Take a hard look at this so called friendship.

And noises.", "That's assuming that OP said \"hey let's just pick food and go to your place and eat.\" Which it doesnt sound like they did. It sounds like the plan possibly changed from eating out to picking up food and there was no discussion about where the food was being eaten until they pulled up to her house. If OP said I'm just gonna order food to go, then I'm assuming they're going home after bc you changed the plans and didn't make any mention of coming inside my house until we pulled up to the house, you know. I think that's why this part of the comments is curious about what the exact conversation was about going out to eat. If OP made it known that they planned to eat at the friends house and she waited until they were at her house to say \"no you can't come in\" then she sucks for bot making that clear beforehand. If OP didnt make their intentions known until they got to her house, then to me that's different. If my house is a mess, no one is coming inside & the friends intial request was to eat out not in.", "It does seem weird. I'm curious as to whether the plan was for them to always pick up food or if they were supposed to sit down & eat. Like what was that conversation, you're right though, the exchange between them was super weird.", "No, not really. I think any change of plans from eating out together to ordering to take away would/should prompt the discussion of how/where to eat the take out. \n\nI do agree that knowing exactly how the conversation went would be helpful, but I do think that since they had planned to eat *together*, it's reasonable to think that wouldn't change automatically.", "For me personally that would change things, if I want folks at my house, I'd ask them to come hang out and we order food. If I dont want folks over but wanna go out to eat, I ask folks if they wanna go out to eat. If it was decided that we were doing take out instead, I'd assume they weren't coming over, bc that's not what I invited you to do. Now if you asked me if you could come over, I'd be more open to the idea, but we dont know if that was asked before hand or not. If my home is not clean then the idea of having people over, gives me anxiety and that's to include friends and family. Especially if I have kids, things can get messy pretty quick when there's children involved.", "I can mostly see that, except OP still paid for all the food, so I'd expect that to change as well if I invited someone to eat and then that changed...", "That's fair, but this is why I wanna know the conversation, bc it didnt seem like OP was supposed to pay for all of the food originally. OP said they offered to buy food for her and her kids. If I'm not mistaken, the original invite was just for OP and their friend to go out and eat together, and then that changed. Who changed the original plans? To me it matters bc if OP's friend made that request of them, then she's wrong, especially if they were clear about their intention to hang out at their house afterwards. Like I can sees both sides of this and because OP is vague about the conversation, I really can't say. \n\nAnother thing is, as a parent you can't come home with takeout and eat in front of tour kids & not have food for them also, so perhaps she declined the food at all bc she couldn't afford to buy for everyone and that's where OP offered to cover, idk. It's just weird that this wasnt discussed during the change of plans & I feel like if they did discuss this before hand, why wouldnt OP put that. Like how did yall get from eating out, to take out, to OP buying everyone's food .", "She's inconsiderate rude and an a-hole dump her as a friend", "NTA, I would have said \"oh okay well since you're just going straight to sleep..\" **grab both bags I paid for** and drove off to enjoy my food in my car in a random parking lot", "I am confused - she asked YOU to hang out with her - is that right?

Honestly, maybe OP did aske before hand and maybe the friends said no already, we dont know, bc all OP stated was that they were supposed to eat out. That turned into picking up takeout, that OP offered to pay for. It's so vague, how was this not a conversation beforehand. It's not excuses l, the exchange literally doesnt make sense. You can show appreciation by saying thank you, gratitude doesnt nees to be in the form of giving access to your home. Like I've said in my other comments it's very possible that the friend was completely in the wrong, providing that this was clearly discussed and they waited until the last minute to say no. But if it was sprung on her when, initially they were never supposed to be at her home, then I dont think she's wrong for not wanting people at her house. Especially if that wasn't the plan and wasnt asked about before they got to her house. That's why I just wanna know what the actual conversation was."]}
