Her mom Emily (30f) had Kira young and was a single mother up until 4yrs ago when she married. Emily has always seemed very annoyed by Kira and had told us several times when she was younger that she \"wanted a boy.\"\u00a0 She eventually had my nephew, that she dotes on and she has become increasingly disinterested in Kira.\u00a0\nAs a result, Kira spends a lot of time with me, my sister, and her grandma. We have taught Kira things her mother has failed to teach her like hair care and basic personal hygiene. When mentioned to Emily about something she probably should've already taught Kira it is dismissed as \"not a big deal.\" Kira knows to ask her mother questions before she asks us to give Emily the first chance to address her concerns. Almost everytime Kira would come back days later to tell us her mom wouldn't/didn't answer, dismissed her, or told her the question was silly/dumb.\u00a0\n\nA year ago we noticed the impending signs of puberty happening for Kira. We talked with Emily several times over the next few months that she needed to start prepping for the puberty talk. Almost every conversation would end with her referring to periods as 'nasty' or 'disgusting.' Last month I picked Kira up from school as her mom was busy at work. As soon as she settles in the car she asks me about periods. I was initially caught off guard by the sudden question but out of habit asked Kira what her mom had told her. Her response: \"she told me to stop asking her about such nasty things.\" I was pissed- so when we got home I told Kira everything she needed to know about her period. As we were talking through menstrual products Kira tells me that she thinks she started her period. After clarifying, I went to my bathroom, got her the items she needed, and instructed her on their use and disposal. We got back to talking about calendar tracking and it came out that she didn't start that day like I thought, but the day prior. She'd been using a pad given by the school nurse and TP for the last 24hrs! She'd told her mother and was again dismissed! Livid, I tried to call and text Emily over the next hour telling her what was going on. All I got was an eye-roll emoji. So I called our mom who did get a hold of her and she told her off. Hours later Emily calls back mad calling me an AH saying that I made her look bad and mad that I talked to Kira about something \"so personal.\" She has not let Kira come to my house until I apologize for \"taking the opportunity from her.\" Per my older sister, Kira says her mother is giving her the cold shoulder for making her look bad and has still not talked to her! Emily is telling family members and mutual friends that I ruined a special moment for her that she'll never get back. A few are split, whereas some that know how Emily is with Kira are on my side.

Like just calmly approach the witch and be like 'hey, you don't want a daughter, you've admitted that, why not just let us take her and take over her care?'\n\nEither she says yes, and it sucks because she's awful but at least the kid gets out, or she says no and basically admits that she enjoys abusing and traumatizing her child, which leads to a call to child protective services and filing for emergency custody. I wouldn't be shocked if she already beats her or starts to soon.", "Except the neglect and abuse she's facing is only getting worse. What's it going to take for one of y'all to finally do what's best for the kid and (un)officially take her in? I mean, something should have been done already based on the fact she didn't even know how to take care of her own personal hygiene. \n\nScrew the fact that heartless woman is your sister, she doesn't deserve to keep her daughter.", "Girl, this is ABUSE!!! You SHOULD officially take her!!! This is neglect!!!", "That mindset needs to change. She is mistreating that child. She is neglecting that child. That is emotional abuse and you and your family are no better than her if you don't take actions and get kira out of there.", "okay but someone probably needs to try and take her. her mother is negligent at best and downright abusive at worst. and it\u2019s only going to get worse as Kira gets older. she deserves stability and a parental figure that actually wants her around.", "It\u2019s good that you guys are doing what you can for Kira, but if you\u2019re able, you need to do more, as a product of a neglectful parent, you guys need to stop doing what your sister wants and start doing what your niece needs regardless of the former.\n\nIf your niece hadn\u2019t felt comfortable enough to come to you she very well might have had that one pad on for the duration, which is needless to say, not safe.\n\nThis does not even broach the fact that anything her mother does say to her is obviously going to be about how it\u2019s nasty and gross, and all Kira will hear is that she\u2019s nasty and gross", "I'm so glad I am not the only one who sees the sense of urgency here. Kira is in legitimate danger. Maybe I've watched one to many episodes of \"Deadly Women,\" but I don't see a good outcome if she is left in her mother's home.", "Yes, I was going to suggest fake apologizing, too, just keep peace and get the girl back.  While it\u2019s well within f your right to not do such a thing, you appear to care about the girl, and the fake apology is just crap one deals with to avoid an abuser.  The mother is probably abusive enough for CPS, and getting them involved is always fraught, but keeping the girl with you as much as possible is best for her.", "Hey, in addition to considering a call to CPS, you can absolutely let someone at your niece's school know about this. At the very least, they are involved because they ended up giving her a pad. Bet someone made a note of it! It might be useful to expand to them on why they had to give her a pad.. because the girl was told nothing. And now that she's been told something, her own mother is still trying to pass it off, and her attitude has been hostile toward her little girl. She has refused to let you have any contact. I am sure the school has heard this type of story before, and I will just bet that they have a much easier access to cps.", "CALL CPS she's neglecting and abusing her child", "Your sister wanted a son. She got one so now the daughter is just an annoyance and nothing to be bothered about. \n\nSome people get really crazy about the gender of their child/children. Your sister is obviously one of them. In her head she has one child, her son. \n\nSo now she lashed at you because your mom forced her to take care of her daughter. She doesn't want to, she also doesn't want it to be known, and she is furious about it. If your sister follows the same pattern as one of my friend's mother, she will also take it out on Kira. And she will still refuse to acknowledge her daughter. \n\nBe ready to be there, in a parental role, to your niece for everything because your sister will never do it. From acne treatment to protection to college.\n\nNTA", "This makes me so sad.  :(", "Im not entirely sure why you didn\u2019t educate Kira when your own sister kept blowing YOU off when you brought up periods.\n\nThat being said, you should probably handle the birds and the bees talk before lack of education regarding her body becomes a greater problem for Kira.", "In addition, at the very least start documenting all instances of neglect that you become aware of to have proof when you contact CPS or one of you wants to officially take custody", "I'm hoping someone is trying to move her out of that situation.", "But what if Kira had gotten a tampon from a friend? Fortunately that didn\u2019t happen, but her mother neglected to teach her important health information, and it could have put Kira in danger.", "It is possible from using pads, just rare, and not really worth the risk for someone to take. And even if it wasnt possible there are the uti\u2019s etc that the child could get that if left untreated can cause all sorts of issues.", "This sub is *infested* with trolls and karma farmers.", "I used kidshealth.org when I was that age, it was really good too. They have separate websites for kids, teens, parents, and now they have one for educators too.", "Considering mom has also neglected to teach her about things like basic personal hygiene, hair care etc I'd recommend the book The Care and Keeping of You! It teaches things in very simple easy to access language, everything from deodorant to periods.", "yes yes yes. it is even more! It talks about consent and expectations. There is a quiz \"are you ready\"?  Take it! I realized I was \"ready\" in my late 30s. [here it is]   (https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/ready_or_not_the_scarleteen_sex_readiness_checklist)", "I've never heard of that site before, thank you.", "She is a terrible mom, don\u2019t get me wrong, but CPS is never going to waste their time or resources on case like this. The child isn\u2019t being physically harmed, has a roof over her head, food to eat, and goes to school. Their hands are tied here. Unless there are other things going on that OP hasn\u2019t mentioned, CPS cannot help this kid.", "Exactly - I also question whether OP has stepped up enough given the available information.", "Unfortunately, CPS would not step in on a case like this.  In my state, CPS is overloaded and focus on children who are physically abused, molested or starved.  With the way the mother talks her way out of things, she would be able to convinced overworked CPS caseworkers that this is just a \"misunderstanding\".", "This behavior will only get worse until something drastic happens. Might be outside intervention, might be when Kira cuts all contact ASAP. It's up to those who care about Kira to decide which comes first.", "I think she hates women. She likes having a son and thinks periods are shameful and didn\u2019t bother teaching her daughter how to care for her body.", "In my area at least, CPS won't do anything if there is no visible physical abuse.  And even then, very little happens. I spoke to CPS many times about my cousins neglect of her kids. When the worker went to the house, there were over 100 black bags of trash in the house, mice living in the oven, and the kids clothes smelled like cat pee. They gave her 2 weeks to ckean it up, and as long as there was an improvement, the case was closed. The worker finaly told me that unless they find very clear evidence of physical or sexual abuse, they will not take the kids away. I would make sure to document everything though, just in case.", "I agree with everything here.", "It sounds like any attempt at all, whether it be family approaching with love or CPS approaching with police, would probably be met with resistance and yet more theatrical fake dramatics. Seems like it might work best if family can make her think it\u2019s her own idea to get rid of her unwanted child so Kira can live with her real family members who actually love her\n\nNTA; good luck, op & Kira!", "Deadly Women has profiled a lot of horrific women. I hope Kira can live with OP or her other caring aunt and grandmother.", "Mother isn't going to kill her, just mentally.", "Question, if you don\u2019t mind answering. Could you explain what that reference means?", "This is the part that made me so upset. Like what can you do with a daughter that you can\u2019t do with a son (or vice versa)?\n\nMy daughter is a complete tomboy, and she loves when I take her fishing or to sports games. My four year old son loves when we have tea parties or when he gets to dress up like a princess.", "Oh god yes it\u2019s disgusting and awful. The risk of TSS is low but other infections and just general smell", "Yup. My sister had this book and then it was passed down to me. Really covers all sorts of things, like bra shopping and different types of bras, braces/teeth care, shaving/deodorant, periods, emotions.", "I put Care and Keeping and some other American Doll books in with the gender neutral and boy-focused puberty books in my 9 year old son's room. There is ZERO chance he'd choose those books at the store or library, but he's definitely looking at them when we're not around. They're a great reference for boys, too!", "Oh man, that book came out right when I needed it.  It was invaluable to me as a kid.", "I forgot all about this book. I really reading it. Thanks for the memories", "yeah, my nieces are a few years away from needing it but I'm already keeping my eye out for a couple of copies.\n\nmy feeling is that they could share a copy but it's the sorta of book that it's probably worth them each having their own copy.", "Thank you for this link! I just sent it to my partner so he can review it as a possible resource for his teenagers. You helped someone today.", "Unfortunately, if this country is anything like my own they won't even check anything. We reported a child being physically abused, we took care of her for a week after she ran away. We called every day, to check was was happening. They in the end told us to send her home. They said \"sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind\" and told us to either send her home, drop her off at a women shelter (SHE WAS 13) or they'd send the police over to take her home. We had no choice. She's still there and they never sent anyone to check it out.\n\nThis was after 4 people had reported her abuse. Her older brother, the school, us, and herself. They didn't do shit and we all know it. It's horrible and this isn't uncommon.", "Yeah, people on this sub are way too quick to suggest CPS. This is shitty parenting but it\u2019s not the kind of thing CPS would bother with. Maybe she can talk to a school counselor?", "Thats just wrong. Neglect and emotional abuse are also mandated reports and investigated by CPS and 100% should be called when neglect or emotional abuse is taking place. Yikes.", "Nonsense, psychological abuse is also a concern of child protection services. They can insist on putting a support worker in the home to train mom.", "It\u2019s a true crime show that focuses on women. There have been many episodes of abusive parents who isolate their victim once other people start to catch on. It\u2019s extreme, I know. But the \u201cmother\u201d in this post will not want others to know how poorly she treats her daughter because it will not only reflect badly on her, it also takes the spotlight off the golden child. That makes it a very dangerous time for this child especially now that she is being isolated.", "I kept mine under my bed for YEARS as a reference, so i could try to solve the problem myself instead of calling for my mother every time i had an easy to answer question/forgot about something. Lifesaver for all sorts of things I preferred not to ask my mom about.", "Love this. I plan to do the same for my boys when they reach that age.", "Yeah, like I wish we lived in a world where CPS would help set that mother straight or give custody of the kid to grandma or OP, but they have bigger fish to fry and not enough resources even for the extreme situations. \nConsidering all of that, a school counselor is probably the most viable option in this case.", "It is a mandated report. But CPS generally still won\u2019t do anything.", "Unfortunately, emotionally neglecting your child won\u2019t get the CPS on your butt. At least not in the US. Like I said, this mom is shit, but CPS\u2019s hands are tied unless there is more going on.", "Unfortunately this is hugely dependent on where they are. The city I live in has great resources for things like this, there's terrific prevention and family strengthening services. However, I used to work in a rural area of another state and couldn't even get CPS to remove a child from a home where a person who had been convicted of sexual abuse of that child was living. They told me the child was old enough to know to tell someone and could lock her door at night, and it's not like there's anything they could do, she was old enough for a group home and there weren't any foster beds.\n\nThe completely disjointed and dysfunctional system we have for child protective services in this country is a disgrace.", "I don\u2019t know where you live, but in the US this wouldn\u2019t even be a blip on their radar.", "It should be a concern. In reality, it usually is not.", "Oh, no. Those poor kids.): Thank you for explaining, it\u2019s helpful.", "Yes! And it had great tidbits. I remember my friend had the same book and she told me that\u2019s why she always wore camis when we were younger - the book said if you felt left out about not wearing a bra yet when other girls already were, wear a cami under your shirt. That book also taught about the importance of cotton underwear and cold water to get blood stains out of things lol", "Canada"]}
