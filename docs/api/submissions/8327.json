I am dumb, I have no other reasoning. \nI have had a chance to speak to both of my children regarding this situation.\nSon- he was never asked if he wanted to go. His father assumed, since he doesn\u2019t like to fly he wouldn\u2019t want to go. My son agreed that he would not want to go on this trip. Son is the child that my ex put his hands on when he was angry with him. Ex later blamed me for his inability to de-escalate a situation. My ex is currently a therapist for teenagers. \nDaughter- she is very conflicted. She also thinks she will make it back in time for her gymnastics meet (her final meet is the same weekend they would be gone) there is no way she will make it back in time. (When I asked the ex if he knew she had a meet he said \u201cyes, but Disney\u201d) I told my daughter to take time to think about it and we can discuss it once she has had time to process. I am not a perfect mother but I am trying.\nParenting plan modification- he said all that stuff to scare me because I asked for child support to be recalculated (he easily now makes 3 times what I make, I was a stay at home mom for a very long time). He didn\u2019t ask for extra time with our son because he knows better. He spoils the kids with money. They currently have 5 snakes, three dogs, a hedgehog and a Guinea pig at his house. Don\u2019t get me started on name brand stuff.\nMy ex was and still is in incredible my abusive. He messed me up in ways I hope my kids never have to deal with. I could go on about what he did to me for hours, but this is already a wall of text. \nTL:DR I probably responded too quickly when my ex asked, and I have brought my daughter into the conversation, but, as she was just recently at Disney and my family rarely is able to all be together I think her attending the party is more important. (And yes, it is my birthday, but also a good excuse to get people together. ) \nAnd just one more thing. My dad has cancer and recently had two heart attacks. He is in his 70\u2019s, so yes, I prioritize family time over a theme park that will still be standing for the rest of her life.\n\nThank you for the feedback, 99% of it was helpful. \n\n\nI have a (13F) with my ex. My ex and i had a horrible divorce and we only communicate through a parenting app. He is the worst and regularly denies me time with the kids.\nHe just asked me for a Wednesday evening through Sunday (my parenting time is Wed-Friday and this also happens to be my weekend). He said the time was to take daughter to Disneyland. (We live in the Midwest.) There was nothing in there about taking our (16M) son. I declined the trade because I don\u2019t think she should be missing school for a vacation and the trip is the weekend before my 40th birthday and I have a huge party planned. If my daughter finds out I said she couldn\u2019t go she is going to be so mad and the ex is petty enough to tell her. I do feel bad about saying no so am wondering if IATA.\n\nEDITED TO CLARIFY: This is not just a normal party I am hosting. This is a huge party with another friend and I have friends and family traveling from other states to be here. (My brother even said he could take half a day out if the field to be there for a little bit. Farmers never take days off during planting season. \nHe didn\u2019t tell me why our son was not included. I have no problem with him taking her another time. Even if it is my weekend. Just not this specific weekend.\n\nLAST EDIT I SWEAR: A few hours after I declined the time trade I received the following from his attorney (edited to remove names): \n\nEx\u2019s proposal is as follows:\n\nRegarding daughter, he would have final say on all school, activity, religious and medical decisions, after seeking your input, effective immediately (upon entry of a stipulation).\nYou both would maintain the current physical custody arrangement through the spring semester to complete this school year in current town.\n\nBeginning in Summer, 2023:\n\nDaughter would live with him Monday through Friday and every other weekend (aligning with the current weekend schedule).\nYou would get her regular holidays aligning with the decree/parenting plan, plus daughter\u2019s birthday every year, 4th of July every year, and Labor Day every year. You would also get an additional week (7 days) in the summer not overlapping with any of his weekends and to be chosen AFTER both parties select their additional week already in the joint stipulation.", "created_utc": 1674743202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lszqd/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_to_disneyland/", "score": 2704, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also make sure your daughter knows before he will let her know, as you mentioned he's rather petty. He will most likely phrase it as \"I wanted to take you to Disney, but your mom doesn't want you to go\" and that puts the blame on you (plus it'd twist your actual point). Instead, it's more of a \"I love for you to go, just not that specific period. Your dad and I will find a more convenient time\" or something to that effect.

Sure, she\u2019ll be pissed once your ex tells her, but the fact that he had planned this during YOUR time with YOUR daughter without consulting you what-so-ever is pretty fucked. And if the argument of \u201cconsulting with you was asking to take her during your time off\u201d is a defense to be used by him I\u2019d say there\u2019s a difference between consultation vs. being stubbornly petty over getting shot down. \n\nYour time with your child is temporary, don\u2019t lose out on what time you have left with them while they\u2019re young.

It's fairer and less confusing for the kids.", "NTA. Your reasoning is more than understandable.", "NTA. There's no reason ex can't take daughter during his time. He's being manipulative. You're not saying no to Disneyland, you're saying no to a time switch.\n\nBut you should definitely talk to your daughter before he does, because he's totally going to spin it like you're the evil witch who said no to Disney.

Look, if your ex offered some of his days in exchange then I\u2019d say it\u2019s a fair trade but it also falls on your birthday party. A trip to Disney land is not time specific.

You're still TA if you don't ask her what she wants. You wanting her at your special birthday party is not the same as her wanting to be there. You should not be prioritising your hurt feelings as her nearly 40-year-old mother over her feelings as a 13-year-old. That's just completely inappropriate. \n\nFrankly, from a parenting perspective, I'm kind of horrified that you're more worried about your birthday and your hurt feelings, and not even curious much less asking about why he's taking one of your kids to Disney and leaving the other one out.

He can always plan it on his weekend. I feel he did this on purpose", "NTA he can and should take them on his time and when they don\u2019t have school. And both kids should be invited. There\u2019s no reason he HAS to take her on this specific week unless he like, won timed tickets or something.", "NTA, part of planning a trip is making sure the people involved are available. Your daughter is not available, so he will need to make a different plan.\n\nIf she gets pissed at you, then it\u2019s probably him trying to alienate her from you and I\u2019m not sure how effective explanations will really be, but I would stick with being confused and surprised by the idea that he would plan a trip around time when she\u2019d in school AND you have her, and then not be able or willing to reschedule for time when he\u2019s knows she\u2019s available.

My dad (even if he never said it explicitly) resented me for it. It took years of introspection for me to forgive myself for choosing -- to realize that I was a *child* and that it was unfair of them to ask me to make these decisions in the first place. Unfortunately this dynamic had lasting effects -- it continues to affect my relationship with both of my parents as an adult, even though they are now on much better terms.\n\nWhile it's wonderful that you want to hear what your daughter thinks about this and to give her some agency, you might be putting her in a tough spot should she feel like she needs to choose between her parents.
