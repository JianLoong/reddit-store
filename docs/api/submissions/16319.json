{"id": 16319, "submission_id": "136yjlk", "title": "AITA for making my husband change his custody agreement?", "selftext": "Yes, I'm an evil stepmom. Judge accordingly.\n\nMy (38f) husband (40m) and I have 4 girls - H1 (14), H2 (12), M1 (10), and O (2). We've been married for 6 years. While we are a blended family, all of our daughters are, well, ours. \n\nThe issue comes in with my husband's ex, J (38f). She chooses not to drive (not a medical issue or disability), so transporting our oldest two always falls on my husband or I. This means all doctor appointments, school events, extra curriculars. Everything. \n\nIn November, we got a call from the principal that H1 and H2 were missing a lot of school, and their attendance would need to improve after winter break to avoid summer school. We talked with girls, who said that if they missed the bus, they missed school because J didn't have a way to get them there. So my husband started driving them every day. It worked for a while, but the girls complained about waking up even earlier, since hubs has work. It also meant I was left trying to get M and O out the door myself before getting to work.\n\nStarting January through March, I noted every time my husband needed to do something for his girls on J's time, and how long it took. I also factored in time my husband lost time due to J not driving, like needing them home by 8 instead of picking them up at 8. At the beginning of April, I sat him down and showed him my data. Over 3 months, he/we ended up with his girls nearly 70% of the time. I also showed him how the current schedule was impacting our life together. \n\nThis may be why I'm the AH. Hubs asked what I thought we should do. I told him it was obvious, that we should petition to change custody so we had them more regularly. I pointed out that we had them 3 nights/week minimum already, and saw them for dance and softball and most weekends. It made sense to switch the custody agreement so that he wasn't paying CS for time that we had the kids. I also brought up we live in a better school district, and H1 would be starting high school in the fall. She's such a brilliant girl, I think being in our district would help her tremendously. \n\nWell, today the custody agreement was settled. It flipped so we have them 6 days/ every other, and J has them 1 day/ every other. The girls got to have a say, and both want to live with us. After meeting with the judge, J pulled me aside and told me I was hateful, that I was stealing her children away, that I was flaunting my privilege, and I was \"basically robbing her\". I didn't say anything, but I'm still upset and wondering if I should have left it alone.

Y\u2019all were doing that much driving anyway, the two older kids verbalized what they wanted, and now everyone (minus the ex wife) is happy.

You're far from an evil stepmother, you're a great one.", "NTA\nThe judge asked the kids what they wanted, and the custody agreement reflects what the kids want.", "NTA  \nEspecially since the girls got a say in it and wanted to stay with you guys. You did the right thing imo.", "NTA. You didn't make him do anything. He was on board, the kids were on board, J is just mad she isn't getting as much child support anymore. You're putting the kids first.", "NTA. This is why they have custody hearings. If she wants to be able to spend more time with them, perhaps she should take driving lessons.", "NTA. J wanted it both ways. She was inconveniencing everyone around her due to her personal choice. This makes more sense for everyone, especially the kids.", "NTA. Nothing you did was malicious. It was in the best interest of the children, his, yours, and shared. The ex can choose not to drive, but it is up to her to arrange transportation when the kids are with her. Not rely on her ex-husband to do everything. And there is NO EXCUSE for not getting them to school.", "NTA, this was the best arrangement for everyone. If J gets a license, she can petition the court to change the arrangement.", "NTA, you are doing what is best for the kids and that is what is most important. If J cannot get the kids to school she shouldn't have custody full stop. Getting your kids to school is literally the bare minimum as a parent (fed, clothed, healthy of course as well).", "NTA - You are the complete opposite of an evil stepmother to these girls. And good for you. They need stability and the two of you seem to provide it.", "NTA. Evil you are not! You're thoughtful and caring and absolutely did the right thing. It's obvious this was the way to go. The ex is mad because she's losing her money. She was lazy anyway and I can't believe the courts awarded her majority custody if she can't even drive. Good for you. Keep up the good work. The kids clearly like you because they chose you over their own mother.", "NTA, you are absolutely correct that your husband shouldn\u2019t be paying child support on days you have the kids. And if their mom isn\u2019t reliably getting them to school (whether it be getting them to the bus stop or driving them), she wasn\u2019t doing what she needed to do as a custodial parent. In the end, you\u2019re looking out for these girls\u2019 well being.", "NTA NTA NTA!!! I love that you stepped of for these kids and made the appropriate changes through the court. Mom\u2019s circumstances are unfortunate, but this is in their best interest and mom should be able to see that.", "It says a lot that the kids were happy to move to yours for most of the time over their being with their mother. Do they not have a good relationship with her?", "NTA. Her situation was negatively impacting the girls. You did the right thing. You also didn't make him do anything, you made a decision together, a good decision.", "NTA\n\nIf J can\u2019t drive, she needs to come up with other solutions. Public transport, taxis, walking, rising, asking friends and families, carpools she contributes gas money too.\n\nOr even changing her decision not to drive if there\u2019s not a trauma- or deep fear- based reason for the decision.\n\nSo many options. Letting her kids miss school is NOT one of those options.\n\nAlso, the girls are old enough to clearly state what they want. If they want to live with you, they should.", "NTA\n\nIt really just sounds like you formalized an arrangment that was already taking shape on its own through J's own neglect.", "NTA, this is sort of a sensitive subject because my parents are divorced, and the thought of my stepmom making decisions like this irks me\u2026. because my mom was a good mom. but these girls\u2019 mom is not. you\u2019re looking out for these kids as if they\u2019re your own and stepping forward as a motherly figure, i know that it\u2019s probably tough as you most likely feel like you\u2019re overstepping boundaries in a way. but this was better for the girls and it showed with how they wanted to live with you and their father. you\u2019re a good person for this.", "NTA. It seems like you have the girls\u2019 best interests at heart. Your primary motivation seems to be getting them to a good school on time every day and making sure they are happy. Money seems to be secondary? So based on what you\u2019ve said think you are in the clear.", "You're in no way evil at all! NTA. It sounds like your girls will be so much happier and that's what counts. Their mother is a grade-A AH.", "Easy NTA. What you did was what was best for the girls and their father. J can stay mad all she wants, but ultimately it doesn't matter", "INFO: \n\n>Yes, I'm an evil stepmom. Judge accordingly.\n\nWhat do you mean by this? After reading your entire post it sounds like you only want the best for your stepchildren?", "NTA. Those kids are old enough to decide where they want to be. Kids recognize integrity and their mother chose to have them miss school because she\u2019s lazy. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Its the schedule that works best considering the extra time you two spend with the girls due to driving requirements. If the mom wanted to learn to drive and share in that responsibility it would make more sense to split time more evenly. \n\nAs it stands now, its not fair for her refusal to drive to continually impact and make difficulties for you and your husbands household.", "NTA\n\nI was expecting to get to the part where you complained or caused a scene or something but I was wrong, you might\u2019ve raised the concern about the old arrangement but it wasn\u2019t working for anyone, kids included, they chose to be with you and your husband chose to take up your suggestion of them being with you more often. You didn\u2019t steal her kids, she didn\u2019t parent them well enough for them to want to stay.", "NTA. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re an evil stepmother. I think you made a sound judgement on the situation you were facing which works out best for the children. I had a similar situation which I hope will turn out for the best.", "NTA you are putting the kids first this new arrangement will be more consistent", "NTA. \n\nJ wants to \"have kids\" without putting any effort into it, and the kids don't even want to be with her. She's trying to manipulate you, too. Ignore her, and don't talk to her.", "NTA you made records to back yourself up and the bio mom was being useless.", "NTA the court did what's better for the kids and let  what they wanted play into the decision. I expected something completely different when you made the evil stepmother comment. You should like a great stepmom.", "NTA you have done absolutely the best thing for the kids and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. They also choose to stay with you and your husband. What J thinks is irrelevant it\u2019s what the kids think that matters and if they are happy then you have absolutely done the right thing", "NTA, you are the opposite of evil stepmother!  You wanted the arrangement changed so it worked better for the kids, especially his.  That's heartwarmingly wonderful. The fact the girls even testified that they want to live with you speaks absolute volumes with how they feel being there.  J is probably just horked that she's losing the income and the chain she could use to yank your husband around with.", "NTA that is just life", "NTA.  The decision you made was what was best for the kids, and also what THEY wanted as well.  It sounds like J is more concerned about her own feelings (and possibly financial situation) than her children's well-being.", "NTA It's what the girls wanted. I would have assumed it was what their mom wanted, too, given how little effort she puts in.", "NTA - you are an AWESOME step-mom!!  You did what needed to be done for your kids, and they will be happier and thrive as a result.  J had her chance and fucked it up.  \n\nAs for the current time-sharing that she DOES have, I hope you have it in there that the party whose time is starting is supposed to pick them up.  So J would pick them up from your house and you would pick them up from her house.  And that way, if she doesn't show, the kids stay with you.\n\nDo NOT feel guilty.  The girls had input, this is what they want.", "NTA. It sounds like no one forced anyone to do anything here and it was a mutual decision with your husband. It also provides the kids with a little more stability and if they had a say too it all seems very fair", "Easy NTA at all. You have those girls best interest at heart more then they\u2019re own mother. Hell you are more of a mother than she is. She\u2019s being selfish and lazy by not even making sure her own children get to school. I\u2019m surprised that she didn\u2019t get a notice for truancy court. She can\u2019t have it both ways, and she needs to think of they\u2019re futures. Definitely not an evil stepmom.", "NTA. My experience with a legal judgment like this is zero but I would assume that the court would have allowed her to show how she could remedy this for the custody to remain as it was. She clearly didn\u2019t have a plan", "\ud83d\ude44 why post this?", "I'd say NTA based on the girls themselves want to stay with you and your husband, I do believe ultimately it should be their say.\nBUT there's a lot of missing information here.\nSuch as:\nWhat's her reason for not driving? If not physical is it psychological? Financial?\nWhy did they miss the bus/school bus constantly? \nWas there ever enough communication between the 3 parents about ways to solve this and have your husband given her an ultimatum before this custody situation changed?\nI'm conflicted between NTA and NAH, all we knew about her character is that she doesn't drive and that somehow in her own words she's less privileged. Not owning a car shouldn't warrant a bad parent title. So I'm not sure that she's the AH here either unless we know more about her situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
