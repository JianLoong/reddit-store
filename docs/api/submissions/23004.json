{"id": 23004, "submission_id": "1581x4p", "title": "AITA for kicking out my girlfriends dad, making him drive 15 hours home at 10pm?", "selftext": "My girlfriend (23F) and I (22M) recently bought our first house together, a 1970s fixer-upper. Her mother was a tremendous help during our move-in and the initial unpacking. Meanwhile, her dad had plans to visit later, bringing some furniture and assisting with house fixes.\n\nNow, here's some backstory on her dad - I've never been a fan. He's a textbook narcissist and treats the women in his life like maids. We've clashed before, and I was worried about him coming over, fearing a big blowout.\n\nMy girlfriend shared my concerns about his visit - she doesn't like him any more than I do. But if we asked him not to come, he'd freak out, and we'd never get our furniture. Plus, we didn't want to make things harder for her mom by starting family drama.\n\nWhen he finally arrived, things were tense from the start. He was rude to me, criticizing my plans and even laughed at me for wanting to bring some electrical up to code. He insisted on telling me that he knew better, despite my background in construction, trade school, and woodworking.\n\nAs frustrating as that was, it got worse when he started belittling my girlfriend. He told her she should be cleaning or cooking, that she wasn't capable of doing any home repairs. When she offered to help him lift something, he outright laughed in her face. She wanted to learn about basic repairs, and he mocked her for it. I couldn't stand to see him treat her like that.\n\nI talked to my girlfriend privately about it. I was furious at how he disrespected her in her own home. She's incredibly capable and smart. I wanted him out, but I didn't want to make things harder for her mom or take away my girlfriend's autonomy. It was her family, her house, and her decision.\n\nUltimately, we decided I would call her mom the next day and brainstorm ways to talk to her dad about his behavior without causing a massive argument. We both agreed I had to be the one to talk to him, as he wouldn't respect my girlfriend enough to hear her out.\n\nThe next day, as we were about to head to the store, my girlfriend went to help him clear out some stuff from his truck. During, I heard him call her stupid for taking something out of the truck bed, though he had told her to clear it out. She stood up for herself, saying he couldn't talk to her like that, and that's when I heard him call her \"just an entitled, spoiled brat.\" That was the last straw.\n\nI got out of the truck and told him to leave. He claimed he did nothing wrong. I lost my temper, expressing my anger at how he treated his daughter, and called him a sad excuse for a man. I made him pick up instantly and drive home - a 15-hour drive.\n\nI don't regret making him leave, but I'm wondering if I am the asshole here. My girlfriend supports my decision, but I wonder if taking it away from her was wrong. After all, he was here to help, and maybe I should have tolerated the abuse until he decided to leave.

I am sure he could have found a motel *somewhere* between your house and his. \n\nAnd you had your GF and her mother backing you up, it sounds like. Never again let him darken your door. The distance should help a lot with that. NTA", "NTA. You and your gf are better off cutting ties with him. You both don\u2019t need to be surrounded by a man like that. Your gf is lucky to have a man like you to show her that his behaviour is not how you treat a woman. He wasn\u2019t helping, he was abusing and causing a hostile environment for the both of you. I wish you both nothing but the best, and congrats on moving in together.", "I think the best judge of how you acted here is your GF.  If she\u2019s content with how things turned out, you\u2019re good.  When you act to defend someone else, the most important thing is often the way it leaves that person feeling - they\u2019re the injured party, so they should have a say in how things get resolved.  As it sounds like your GF is fine with how things happened, NTA.\n\nI\u2019d have been a bit irritated in her shoes, but I really don\u2019t have a problem with handling conflict and I would\u2019ve told you to stand down while I took care of the situation myself.  My husband knows this about me, so he only steps in when it\u2019s his own family causing problems.  Relationships are all about figuring out where you as a couple balance on these kinds of things.  If you\u2019re still concerned about how those went down, you could ask her \u201cIf this kind of conflict happens with your dad in the future, would this be a good way to handle it, or would you prefer for me to step back and let you handle it?\u201d", "NTA screw him. You don\u2019t need his help. The best way to deal with a narcissist is to set boundaries, which both of you did.", "NTA\n\nJust because someone is helping doesn't mean they get a free pass to be disrespectful.", "NTA but I\u2019m sure some clown is going to say YTA for taking the decision away from her. IMO you just reinforced her own boundaries when she couldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t. If she supports you then she must\u2019ve wanted to say something similar to him but didn\u2019t because of whatever reason - family dynamics, not feeling comfortable, being non confrontational etc. You stepped in and laid down the law which is very respectable and you\u2019re clearly a good man.\n\nDefinitely NTA, everyone should hope to have a partner that has their back like that.", "NTA at least not the biggest one! I think you may have been able to handle it a bit better, but totally understandable that you lost your temper. It sounds like you were already coming up with a plan to handle it more civilly, but blew up before you had the chance. I would say if you want to help me the relationship, apologize for blowing up, but do not apologize for anything else. You could explain that first and foremost you disagree with his attitude towards your partner, and say the same things you said about her here. Apologize for blowing up and nothing else. I would try to remember that the goal of kicking him out seems to have been to send a message about his actions, so you want to redirect things toward that message and away from the anger. You could probably best do this through a letter or text message though, as I'm sure a face to face conversation would go poorly.\n\nAlso, just to clarify I don't think he deserves an apology. Just figured if you want to patch things up before they get worse, that's what I would do.", "NTA she should never be treated like that and never in your presence. You talked to her she is on same page and probably loves you more for being on her side and standing up for her!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
