Your dad may have had a lot of emotions mixed up inside of it.", "Ok so that's a charge that probably had a degree of impact on your family.\n\nFor me - every random breath test is an opportunity for the police to clock my last name, haul me out of the car and treat me like a criminal. I'm always on extra security for flights etc. Also having the police raid my home because they suspected a family member had left drugs there wasn't fun. It's also curtailed by job prospects a little - even though I was only a very young kid when they committed the crimes.\n\nThere is shame, stigma and real world impacts associated with having family in prison ... and that doesn't even touch on the stress that using would have had on your family.\n\nIt's not great that your family didn't visit you but it is a little understandable.\n\nI think if you're angry at your father you shouldn't take it out on your brother. You should probably talk to your brother about how the lack of his visits affected you - well in the future because now is not a constructive time to start that dialogue.\n\nI think whether or not you help now will probably impact how your relationship with your brother will go - do you want to risk destroying it? Your brother has reached out for help at a time when he's probably vulnerable and upset so what you do now will probably have a big impact.\n\nIf I were you than I'd consider helping in ways that I feel able to help, a little would go a long way at the moment. I don't think anyone is wrong in this situation but no-one is right either.\n\nNAH", "I can see why this would make \\*some\\* more conservative people feel really extremely about your crimes. \\*Some\\* people just cannot stand the idea of drugs. \n\nGrief is a difficult time, and your complex relationships don't help. I don't think you should have been expected to help out to \"make up\" for doing something that sent you to prison. This is of course assuming that you have some remorse for your actions and regret for your bad decisions--if prison worked to rehabilitate you, the it should be the only punishment. But they are also in a state of grief, so its not far-fetched that they make some selfish demands. \n\nThat being said, you are still being selfish in your demands too. But you are also allowed to be slightly selfish because it doesn't sound like your father gave you an opportunity to make up after or during your imprisonment. I think you came up with a good compromise of attending for the sake of peace and your own grief, but not contributing to the planning. \n\nIf you would like to maintain your relationship with your brother, you're going to have to be the one to offer an olive branch. I'm sorry to say, but the reality of the consequences of prison extend long after you're released. I could go on a tangent about how wrong I think the prison system is, but I think that's too controversial. So my advice would be to reach out to him and apologize for being selfish. \n\nI think if you show him a little remorse, and offer to do one thing to contribute to planning, then he might be more willing to understand that you don't really want to take part in planning the funeral. Because even without prison as a factor, maybe detachment is how you handle your grief, plenty of people experience grief in that way for what ever reasons. Still, funeral planning can be a lot of work, and its not an easy thing to arrange alone, especially when you're grieving, which is why you should offer to do one thing to help out, and then hold your boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I'd say ESH. because most people \\*do\\* suck when they are in grieving.", "He said drug trafficking in another comment", "It essentially esures that the reason they didnt visit him was due to the nature of the crime...which you cant blame them for.  So him being upset they didnt visit him makes him clearly the asshole", "6 years really isn\u2019t that far off, especially with how drug laws are now", "I have no doubt that he did have a lot of emotions about it. I can\u2019t deny that. But after mom died, idk I guess I thought that we were closer than 6 years of no visits", "I get all that. It\u2019s hard to talk to him about it because I get the feeling he blames me going to prison for dads decline.", "It was drugs as he mentioned in a different comment. He was involved with bad people.", "My god you\u2019re still not giving us the full story 6 years over a drug trafficking alone doesn\u2019t make sense. Tell us more", "And there's more to this story.  So, would your dad be feeling that he thought you were close, but he didn't really know you?  Would your dad be feeling that he thought you were close, but when you were in trouble you turned to a street gang over him and dug in deeper?  \n\nThere's a lot that we are not getting here.  Initially, I was very sympathetic to your cause, but you're just not being very honest here, in an anonymous internet thread.  So, that leads me to believe that you're aware that the whole story doesn't paint you in a great light.", "To be fair that's also a legitimate complaint. The stress is real and has an impact on the body and mind. If your Dad wasn't up to it that probably had a negative impact on his overall health. \n\nAlso I noted that you told someone it was a 4 hour trip to see you? Even if your Dad's health was up to it that's not an easy thing for an over 60 person to manage (8 hour day travelling, accommodation/getting through the prison etc). Like I live 4 hours away from my Nan, some years I don't see her at all. \n\nSo I guess the question is do you want a relationship with your brother and your wider family? If yes, you should swallow your hurt feelings and help your brother now. You can always raise the issue at a later point - and I'd do it with a professional on hand.", "He's probably right. And now you won't even do the minimum amount to try and make up for it? YTA. Talk about a disappointment.", "In my state quick google search for \u201caverage sentence fore drug trafficking\u201d shows \n\n> If this is your first offense, you may be sentenced to between 5 and 40 years in prison with a mandatory minimum sentence of three years.", "My uncle turned witness during drug traffickimg and still got a 10 year sentence.  They come down hard on drugs. My cousins dad killed a guy by drinking amd driving and got less time.", "Umm yes it does. Have you people never heard of mandatory minimums? Or the war on drugs? Depending on the drug, they could\u2019ve locked him up for longer. Y\u2019all are nosey as hell, and asking for way too much information", "It depends on how much drugs or illegal products you had , my father spent 3 years in prison for the same reason and from my understanding he had hella cocaine (abt 2 loads) in the basement of his fathers home , kinda expected more time , but that\u2019s the justice system for ya", "Yes it can.", "YTA\n\nYou're not owed visits, which are quite intrusive to endure, by people who haven't committed any crimes. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be searched and go through metal detectors and all that crap, just so that a felon can have a distraction for a day. \n\n If you actually cared about your family, you wouldn't want them to go through it the physical and emotional stress of visiting you in prison. \n\n Your brother isn't owed any help planning funerals. Funerals are for the living, which you obviously don't care about.", "Not knowing why you were locked up makes it kinda hard to judge. 6yrs is what you did, sentence was probably longer so had to be serious. That said, you didn't visit him during that time. Yes you were locked up, but probably because of your choices, how is it fair to hold him solely responsible when your actions led to this? You have a reason you didnt visit him(wasnt allowed), maybe he had a valid one too. But a lot of older ppl dont visit for many reasons. Ranging from shame & embarrassment, to it being a trigger for them because there is nothing they can do to help their child, to being angry or feeling like if they show up, it in a sense tells their child that they are ok w their choices. You can hang on to grudges all you like but in the end, it will usually hurt you the most. We all make mistakes & choices we wish we could change. Make sure you have done nothing to anyone else b4 you try to hold anyone else accountable for their actions. Because otherwise, you are a hypocrite on top of everything else. And once your dads service is done, its done. Theres no going back to change it", "Apples and oranges bud. My dad passed just over a year ago, still haven't even been able to have a funeral cuz of covid and finances. This could be a chance to heal or a chance to hold grudges. You're free now, only one holding you back is you. Make it count.", "Yeah, context is important in this case.  My father spent plenty of time in prison while I was growing up, for drugs, prostitution, and the like. I remember visiting him when I was a kid, my mother (who had divorced him by that point) still took us to see him. I didn't understand what he'd done then, as I was very young, but I do now. If he'd done something REALLY awful, like SA of a minor, I don't think my mom would have taken us to see him. And I definitely would not have attempted to maintain a relationship as I got older.", "YTA\n\nThis is not something you will get a second chance at.  Not only refusing to help your brother who has reached out to you, but you're robbing yourself here of an opportunity to have a meaningful role in laying your father to rest.\n\nIt sounds like you're quite a selfish person, still trapped in an unhealthy mindset, which landed you in prison in the 1st place. Learn impulse control and stop hurting others, and yourself.  \n\nTry and think of someone else, besides yourself.", "I mean 4 hrs one way is a bit of a distance plus the hassle of security checks and all that and that the prison tells you when you can visit not their choice. It's not easy. \n\nAnd as someone who knows plenty of family members who did drug trafficking, yeah not gonna lie I don't blame them. Before they went to prison, they stole, they assaulted, they lied.to their family. If you had done that I can't blame them for not wanting to visit on top of how much it is a pain in the ass to visit", "NTA. Pops wouldn\u2019t do for you. You won\u2019t do for him. I don\u2019t see the problem with it. When someone you value is down you go to see them. He didn\u2019t. For over half a decade.you don\u2019t owe him anything for having to do your time. Your brothers statement was dumb. Continue to do you.", "YTA. They didn\u2019t want to go to a prison and I can\u2019t blame them. You aren\u2019t seeing their side.", "YTA. I think you need to remember that your criminal activity had an impact on your family. You were 4 hours away, which is also much more difficult for people to visit, what with travelling time, working, booking hotels etc.\n\nSix years is a long time to go without visits, and I can\u2019t imagine how much that hurt. \n\nBut I think you need to look at the bigger picture and see that your dads funeral planning really isn\u2019t the time to hold a grudge against your brother. \n\nYou\u2019ve said that you\u2019re working on your relationship with your brother, if you don\u2019t act now, I would imagine this would have a really negative impact on any future relationship with your brother. \n\nAbsolutely have the conversation about how much this has hurt you, but not now. Now is not the time. \n\nWork with your family to plan the funeral. In the future, you can work with your brother to work through some of the pain you are feeling (but also - the pain he is feeling. He lost his dad too. He also lost his brother for 6 years - the impact of prison isn\u2019t just on you).", "INFO: was your prison in the same city/less than a one hour drive away? And we you incarcerated because you did violence against someone?", "And COVID restrictions could also have been a reason they couldn\u2019t visit for a good part of the incarceration.", "And prisons are for people who have broken the law (theoretically) and no one owes OP driving an 8 hour round trip to see him where is actions put him", "Like you seem to be pretending it wasn\u2019t your fault that you ended up in prison?", "He also blames it on the fact that he was with bad people like no personal accountability for his own actions it was the people who he CHOSE to hang around with fault", "He has every right to be hurt his family didn't visit him once for 6 years, and if they couldn't bother to visit him, why would he help pay for funeral", "Just because OP only got caught by police once and sent to prison once doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t putting his family through hell for years before that  does it? What has OP done to take accountability with his family or is it only about what the family did to him because of situation he got himself into", "You was a shitty person yourself. Don\u2019t say stuff like it was the people around me and they was bad. NO! YOU made choices for yourself, YOU got yourself in prison. No one else, YOU", "If they were so ashamed of him, then why do they ask him for help?", "Then the brother shouldn\u2019t feel comfortable asking OP to plan a funeral or be allowed there if it was such a horrible crime. If my kids did something like pape or theft or murder, I couldn\u2019t bear the have them visit my grave", "When they were ashamed of him then they have no business reaching out now. Such hypocrites!", "I hate that phrase \u201cI was involved with bad people\u201d like somehow it absolves them of the choices they made.", "But if we go that road, isn't OPs upbringing somehow a reason for OP getting into drug dealing?   \nThere's a reason there's a lot of shame stigma when a family member is involved with drugs - the family made them in the first place."]}
