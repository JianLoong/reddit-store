How?", "Just so you know, in Washgton servers make the same base wage as everyone else because we aren't some bass-ackwards hellhole that takes every excuse to scew our workers. Furthermore, in Seattle, we are required to give sick days, and I choose to give health care, transit passes, PTO and 401k because I have to to be competitive for workers. We have a growing restaurant workers union out here that is putting on the pressure (in a good way!) to make sure that everyone in the restaurant has a living wage. Tip sharing is normal. You can't keep kitchen staff or dishies without it.\n\nTruthfully I'd prefer just to abolish tipping, but the market isn't there yet.", "typical american assuming everyone lives there :)", "Not where I live. My state is not one of those lame states that let's you pay servers a lower wage so they can make it up with tips.

My main argument is the op of this post is NTA but a dumbass.\n\nMy example before was food service, especially the difference between getting fries and fresh out of the frier fries.\n\nEveryone would love if all food service people gave 100%, and if you give a 30$ tip the restaurant will fie you 100% Hot fries etc etc.\n\nIf you tip 30$ then take it away when you get your food......
