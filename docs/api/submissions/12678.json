You were in a very tough position, though, and I\u2019m not sure that you had a lot of control over things. Your son, being young and clueless did a lot of damage from the start. Her aunt also made a fuss and embarrassed your daughter. Then she felt humiliated by your insinuation that she was being a pig and because of her there would not be enough food for the other guests. [I realize you did not say it that way - but a 14 year old may very well hear it that way.]\n\nWas this a sit-down meal or a walk-around open-house thing? How many people were expected?

Seems like the pieces could have been cut smaller, you and your husband could have passed on having a piece or it should not have been served until every was sitting down at the table.

You want her to gain weight. You Also say she is a picky eater. She was enjoying something enough to want to go back a few times.

You weren't trying to stop her from enjoying the food, but trying to make sure everyone else was able to enjoy some as well. \n\nI would try to make it up to her, after explaining this. Maybe ask for the lasagne recipe from her aunt, and allow her to have as much as her heart and stomach desire. \n\nI definitely understand why this is confusing for her, but like I said, you weren't trying to prevent her from enjoying the food, you just wanted to make sure everyone else could too.", "Somewhat soft YTA.

But you should have handled it privately and explained you\u2019re happy she\u2019s eating but lets wait for a while to see if anyone else wants some.", "YTA for how you said it. You are broaching into ED (not diagnosing) territory with your daughter behavior. Her not eating enough but now changing over to forcing food down as fast as she can is not healthy in the slightest. So telling her \"save some for the rest of us\" is implying it is bad to eat/eat that fast/that amount. The conversation should have went \"honey, there are still guest who have not had a chance to try the lasagna and Your aunt only made enough for everyone to have a plate. Why don't we get you something else since your still hungry and then once everyone else has had the chance to try it, we can see if there is anymore left.\" This removes it as a her eating to much issue and changes it to a sharing/hospitality issue. Further you can offer the suggestion that since you enjoy it so much we can ask your aunt if she could make you one at a later date to enjoy at home?\n\nFurther a 14 year old should be satisfied with a serving of Lasagna and something on the side. You need to be teaching her healthy eating habits. Not just double/triple everything she likes only (which is probably all high calorie foods to start with) Most 14 year old girls eat like 2000 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight. Since she is needing to gain that needs to be higher but she should be getting those extra calories in a healthy way that will not damage her relationship with food. Like a high calorie smoothie in the morning with breakfast or slightly larger portion. Not Second helpings of a full meal.\n\n(all of this is barring a neuro diagnoses that could impact hunger cues and or ability to recognize them, i.e. autism.) I know people say there is nothing wrong with seconds and that's true when it happens every once in a while. But think of it this way. If you were out to dinner with your husband and you finish the first plate of an actual meal (not talking those tiny all you can eat plates), would you then order the same meal again to have seconds??? Most people would say no... Because one meal should satisfy your nutritional needs while filling you stomach. You should never be FULL. You should no longer be hungry. And your daughters needs are no different. While she does need to gain, she should never be eating to the point she is full or sick even. That may mean for her she has to eat 6 small meals a day to get her calories in but she needs to learn to eat when hungry and stop when she is no longer hungry. Your body is amazing at telling you things.", "I don\u2019t understand all these Y T A votes..

Binge eating is also an eating disorder. While it's a good thing that she's enjoys lasagna, it's not healthy to stuff on one food. Also, there's the social aspect of it.

One can be understanding, but that's very different from inconsiderate to others.\nIt's a good thing that she likes this particular food, you can prepare it for her and it's a good way to get the carbs and proteins that she needs.

You shamed her instead. For doing what you\u2019ve pushed her to do.", "YTA you forced her to eat then shamed her when she does.. Big yikes", "YTA - She needs professional counseling and y'all forcing her into binge disorder eating is ***not*** going to help her at all.  On top of that she finally started to eat on her own and you immediately shame her for it.\n\n1. Get her in Professional Counseling\n\n2. Get the aunt to teach you to make lasagna\n\n3. stop doing all that bullshit and actually listen to her \n\nforcing her to binge eat and then her eating food too fast are both horrible things to learn and y'all shaming her is going to make things so much worse", "YTA girl needs therapy and a doctor", "Are you sick in the head OP? Do you know what body dysmorphia is? Have you any idea how you just humiliated your daughter. YTA", "This is going to backfire trust me. They did a simmerler thing to my sister and she ended up being way overweight.. at one time my sister was almost malnourished looking, people thought she was sick with cancer or something and the doctor had my parents do the same thing with her and it was a huge mistake.  And this was years ago though I thought they didn't recommend this anymore because of that.. if she's going back for a thirds and fourths and fifths you guys got to know where this is headed..", "YTA for everything but more so for highlighting the \u201cthirds\u201d as if her eating 3 servings was a monumental crime. \n\nDo better", "Let me repeat myself just in case you don't understand this is going to backfire and you will have an overweight child.", "You have just sent your daughters process back by 1000 steps. This comes from someone who\u2019s had an eating disorder for years and years. Do better. YTA.", "INFO: how shit is your cooking if you need to *force* this kid to eat? Do better.", "Maybe she\u2019ll eat more food if you give her food she actually likes? That way she won\u2019t feel the need to binge on food she enjoys when it becomes available. If you know she likes the lasagne, why aren\u2019t you making it? She enjoys her aunts cooking, so why aren\u2019t you all asking her to show how she makes her food? YTA", "YTA and your sister is too because your daughter asked for each helping and was served before guests arrived. If there was not enough for multiple servings your sister should have said something about how happy she is that Cindy likes the lasagna but needed to wait for another serving until the other guests were served and offered some other foods if she was still hungry. It was not really your son\u2019s or your place to tell Cindy not to eat food her aunt said she could have. If there was not enough food you could have offered to get something more to add to the meal.\n\nIf your daughter is underweight and struggling to eat she might need professional help or more calorie dense foods/drinks instead of larger quantity. (Smoothies may be easier than eating sometimes) If she likes her aunt\u2019s cooking maybe her aunt could teach her to cook.", "NTA. I learnt from a very young age to always see to it that me eating a lot doesn't leave the others hungry, especially when I'm in someone else's place.\n Cindy is 14, she should know better than this.\n The aunt probably had a couple more guests coming, so two trays were probably enough, don't blame someone without the details first.", "YTA.", "ESH because normally at a party, you have some snacks or appetizers out before the meal and you wait until everyone is there to serve the main dish, so the aunt should\u2019ve told her niece to wait for everyone else. The mom for how she told her daughter to save some for the rest of us, she should\u2019ve explained that it was polite to wait until everyone else had a portion. The daughter for not being mindful of manners, it\u2019s just common sense/good manners to not make a pig of yourself as a guest at someone\u2019s party when there\u2019s a limited amount of food. Those saying there should\u2019ve been more food, there likely was a full spread, the aunt was probably counting on people also having salad, garlic bread, veggies, dessert, etc., and figured on everyone having one serving of lasagne (which is very filling). I understand eating disorders, I\u2019ve struggled with them myself, but this seems to be a lack of good manners to me, all the way around.", "The way you said it was wrong knowing that you have been asking her to eat more. For that YTA. However, is called being Considerate of the other people coming to the party. You could have tell her that she should wait for everybody else to grab a plate before going for a third portion just to make sure everybody gets some. I don\u2019t agree with some of this comments.", "YTA if you\u2019re not listening to the pediatrician about her eating habits (and a HUGE one at that). If you\u2019re following their recommendations (including finding her a therapist), then you\u2019re NTA. \n\nAs for the party, i don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for asking Cindy to wait until the other guests arrive to eat more. I get she\u2019s sensitive because of the continuous emphasis on her diet, but everyone should be conscientious about making sure there\u2019s enough food for everyone. It\u2019d be great if you had asked your sister if it was ok, or encouraged Cindy to ask for herself as a way of teaching her about appropriate behavior. I\u2019d probably go soft YTA for the way you went about it, but the instinct to be mindful of other guests was right.", "YTA for all of the previously stated reasons.  \n\n        \nNow you know that if really want her to eat, you need to make her a pan of lasagna. Maybe (and I'm not sure it will be accepted by her after you stepped in it so badly), you can make her a pan of lasagna, and tell her it's all hers.", "I think I figured out why she's underweight. YTA", "Is she a picky eater or are guys as parents not good cooks? Yta either way.", "YTA you are confusing a 14 year old girl. She just told you at that moment. Why were there only two trays of food for a party???? How does that make since that her having thirds will drastically put a dent in how others will get food? Someone did not plan correctly then. Your daughter is about to have body image issues and an eating disorder because of the route you\u2019re going. Fix yourselves now, don\u2019t fix her\u2026.FIX YOURSELF.", "NTA it\u2019s a party, everyone needs to eat. Just being a polite guest.", "I'm wondering if OP is either not listening to her daughter or OP and her husband are really bad at cooking.", "Not just that but ask the aunt to teach her process for making it.  Sometimes someone makes a dish so much that they learn a few tweaks that they don't think to mention because they do it so much.", "This!!", "This. Get her into treatment now op. Good luck.", "THIS!  My first thought was someone who doesn't eat that much normally should not be scarfing down this much food at once.  But then makes you wonder why she's eating so much this time.  She needs medical help to eat proper servings and gain weight responsibly.", "I totally agree. Forcing an underweight picky eater to eat \"as much as possible\" is a recipe for disaster. \nShe already seems to have an unhealthy relationship with food, and the parents are making it worse.", "I know you mean a dietician and/or therapist. I know that. But my immediate thought to reading professional help was \"yeah, OP really should get some cooking lessons if their kid hates their food so much she's severely underweight\".\n\nOP, consider the problem might be your cooking too, and get some of the aunts recipes.", "Honestly this comment made me lol. And agreed YTA. Poor girl.", "Yea.. it\u2019s pretty fucked up.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t already have an eating disorder, her mom is forcing her into one. Terrible parenting.", "Exactly. You could have called for a few pizzas to be delivered if it was going to leave them short. Your daughter is worth it.\n\nAnd I\u2019d get your aunt to make a big batch to freeze, so that your daughter can eat lasagne any time.", "Also, how come are allowed to eat before all guests arrive?? We always have snacks or a light dinner for the kids at family parties so they endure the wait before the family feast starts.", "Agree on the YTA verdict, and on #2 comment. \n\nRegarding comment #1: OP and family were early to the party. We don\u2019t know how many people were invited or what other sort of appetizers, foods, or desserts were planned, so \u201conly\u201d two trays of lasagna might have been enough. The aunt shouldn\u2019t be blamed.", "I agree with you, but they were the guests and the daughter was going to eat a large portion of what was made. Maybe the aunt only had like 5 other people invited and that\u2019s how much they prepared for and then they would have looked like the assholes when there ends up being someone who doesn't get to eat. This is a complicated matter and I don't thinks it's so black and white.", "What!? What entitled person shows up to a party and eats all the food before anyone else even arrives?\n\nI agree OP is YTA but just because she could have phrased her words a little more gently and attempted to resolve it without upsetting her kid or being entitled.\n\nWhy is Op only just finding out that daughter loves lasagne?", "On the first point, how is it OP's fault? Since it's the niece's party, preparations were presumably handled by the aunt/uncle. They were the ones who decided how much food was appropriate for the party. OP just realized that her daughter was about to gobble up all the food at SOMEONE ELSE'S party and stepped in", ">but my sister also says that if I hadn't said something the lasagne would have been finished.\n\nI don't understand this part at all. If Cindy ate two pieces of lasagna, it's okay, but if she had a third piece, the lasagna would have been FINISHED? How small are these trays? \n\nThis whole post sounds like justification to make Cindy all kinds of effed up about eating.", "In the case of ED's you usually do have to 'force' the person to eat more.  There is some serious psychopathology going on although it usually requires professional help to correctly address.", "This is where I'm landing. Clearly she feels hunger and appetite--I think she just doesn't like what she's regularly being served, whether that means OP and husband are bad cooks or the school food is terrible or whatever.", "My son would quite happily eat seconds at 14! Teens have huge appetites. My 17 year old will eat me under the table and he will happily finish what's on my plate and his father's plate if we are full up. 14 year olds are starving most of the time because they are having massive growth spurts. There's a reason people say 14 year olds have bottomless legs", ">Further a 14 year old should be satisfied with a serving of Lasagna and something on the side. \n\n\nDo you actually KNOW any 14 year olds??", "Started good took a weird ass turn, esp bc clearly this kid isn\u2019t chronically stuffing herself & doesn\u2019t need to becoming vigilant about portion control over a single instance of a strong hankering for lasagna", "Are you this girl\u2019s doctor?", "Not everyone can cook and this is rude", "If you have a child that is underweight and picky, the correct thing to do especially with lasagna that's easy to freeze, would have been to ask her sister on the qt to make a third lasagna as if Cindy enjoyed it you want to encourage her to eat as much as she would like to as an opportunity to get more calories in her.", "No, she is being taught that everyone pays attention to exactly how much she eats, and how that compares to everyone else in the room. Yes, one should be considerate of others when eating shared food, but now she knows that whatever amount she chooses is the wrong amount and that she is going to be publicly called out.", "OP is s an asshole for making Cindy eat things she doesn't like.", "This is obviously a different and nuanced situation", "Except this child has been told by her mother to eat as much as she would like to put on weight then changes the rules and tells her she can't!", "Yeah. The language OP uses about the daughter\u2019s food issues kinda gives us a clue where those issues came from.", "Yes, that\u2019s where my mind went too. Cindy clearly wants to eat, if she\u2019s going after her aunt\u2019s cooking with such gusto. They need to make food that appeals to Cindy like that available at home too. Maybe see if the aunt will teach Cindy, and ensure she has the ingredients available and the freedom to make what she wants.", "her being a horrid cook adds a level", "This", "So much this.", "You should always make more food than you think you need. That's just common sense. The daughter clearly has an ED of some manner, so who cares if they look like assholes if the daughter is actually eating? They could've been like, \"Hey, we know she ate a lot, but it's a step in the right direction for her, so we'll just order some more food so everyone has a chance to eat.\" There's other obvious solutions instead of jumping down her throat the moment she shows an interest in food, holding double standards over her head, and then wondering why she has eating problems.", "The parents could each give the daughter their portion and just get takeout or eat a sandwich or whatever extra food can be scrounged up. Even if there was one serving per person, there is still 3 servings available for her this way if the parents wait to eat until she\u2019s done.", "Basically, what they did here was punish the behavior they\u2019ve been wanting to see, which is a great way to get the kid to hate them and also exacerbate what is obviously an eating disorder.", "OP doesn\u2019t say it would have been finished, just that there wouldn\u2019t be enough for the guests that were still to arrive", "Agreed.  I think the upvotes are people who didn\u2019t read the whole thing", "Yeah, well, so is the way they treat their daughter.", "Ye she should be having brains enough at that age to guess that depends on context? Eating everyone's food at someone else's party clearly isn't what her mother taught her, I'm sure.", "It reminds me of that post about a teenage girl who also had an eating disorder and was severely underweight, and her family constantly guilt tripped her into eating. And when she started gaining weight and became \u00e0 tiny bit chubby, they once again policed her eating and told her she was eating too much. \nThis \"all or nothing\", extremist mentality is so harmful, regardless of one's size or health. It's just disordered eating rebranded as a \"health\" diet.", "Eh, maybe they DID make more food than what they thought was needed, but not all of it was lasagna. Thing is, the daughter, being picky and loving the lasagna, only wanted it and not the other food? If the parents were going to order more food, it should have been for the daughter and not the guests. It would be rude to the guests for one person to eat what is prepared while everyone else has to eat takeout rather than a homemade meal, and maybe rude to the aunt for her to have put the effort into making lasagna to share, only to be forced to feed her guests takeout instead of the homemade meal she prepared. It all depends on factors not explained in the post, I think. \n\nEither way, mom didn't handle this the best way possible.", ">You should always make more food than you think you need. That's just common sense.\n\nHave you considered that not everyone has unlimited funds, domestic help, or the time to cook for days?", "Did you see the part where I directly quoted OP at the top of my comment? So, yes, OP said [her sister said] exactly that. \n\nYou can also find that *direct quote* at the end of the OP. It's the second-to-last sentence in the post.", "Its literally just a figure of speech to refer to the fact that was previously stated.\n\nIt's a perfectly normal part of the English language."]}
