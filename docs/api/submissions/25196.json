Over the past few weeks we have been discussing Dan moving into my house since his lease is soon up for renewal and at a higher rate.\n\nNow I am very lucky being able to inherit the house from my grandparents when I was 20 and did a lot of redecorating since then and during the lockdown. Also as my mental health started to degrade during lockdown I have decided to adopt a cat. My baby has helped me tremendously and I made sure she has the best home since she came from not so nice household. It is important to note she is indoor cat only and doesn't really like being outside and because of this has a lot of space in the house dedicated to her as her play area.\n\nNow Dan is aware about my cat and never said anything about it, in fact him and my cat went along really well, so I thought him moving wouldn't be an issue, but apparently it is.\n\nDan's mother passed away about 1.5 years ago and left her dog, which Dan has been taking care of since. The dog is 9 years old and is one of those reactive dogs. His mother never bothered training the dog to behave and when Dan started caring for it, the dog would still misbehave. By reactive I mean it is agressive towards everything and everyone, including Dan himself. Even when we take the dog for walks it would try to attack not just other dogs, but people too. And since Dan is responsible for it, he is fully expecting to move in with the dog. Now I love dogs, but as mentioned this dog needs training and I don't trust it being around my cat. So I have told Dan his dog absolutely can not move in to my house and how dangerous it is to my cat (who is very small in size too and has a few medical conditions). I have asked him to consider other options, like giving the dog to his aunt since she lives in the countryside, has dogs and significantly more experience in looking after \"problematic dogs\" and correcting their behaviour (that's a part of her job).\n\nDan is understanding where I am coming from, however his entire family and friends have been contacting me and him calling me an asshole for \"wanting Dan to give the dog away when it is family and the only thing left from his mother\".", "created_utc": 1692642137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xflqq/aita_for_asking_my_fianc\u00e9_to_give_away_his/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I used to be a dog trainer and it doesn\u2019t matter how reactive or difficult a dog is to live with if you love it, rehoming is often out of the question (understandably) and this is without the added connection to a deceased loved one. If Dan does choose to keep the dog over living with you I hope you won\u2019t take it personally and are able to understand that there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cjust a dog\u201d especially in this situation.

He should have already gotten the dog trained when he took ownership.", "No decision yet.\n\nAny way of sending the dog to a trainer? Not just short term, but intensive behavioral training.

It is a traumatic time for your late almost MIL\u2019s dog, but being in your house would be no less traumatic for her. \n\nJust be there for fianc\u00e9 and support him still having a relationship with the dog assuming that\u2019s enough for him.

Instead:\n\nGive Dan an ultimatum. Either the dog goes to training or it doesn't stay with you. Tell him the dog needs to start training before moving in and it needs to be worked on.

One slipped collar, or leash yanked out if hand, and the dog might be confiscated and euthanized after an attack.", "NTA. \nAnd if you are in the USA then this is also a huge liability you would be taking on if you let Dan move in with his dog. \n\nThe dog needs to be registered to an owner and an address. If the dog moves in that means your address. \nYour homeowners insurance MAY cover you for this dog if it doesn\u2019t have a record of aggressive behavior that has been reported to animal control or it may tell you that it will not cover the dog and now that it knows you have a dog in the home can potentially cause your rates to increase. \nIf they will cover the dog and that dog attacks anyone or another pet and those people decide to take legal action (very common in the US) then YOU and your insurance will be on the hook as the homeowner along with Dan.

You think training a 9 yr old dog is easy after years of neglect?", "Yeah but he could have said \u201cWE made the decision\u201d. Or he could have said he thought it would be best for the dog.

Its not like your boyfriend took in his mom's dog and then you decided to get a cat knowing that it could cause an issue if you ever decided to move in together. This was really the only thing that would have pushed you into the YTA territory for me, and based on the additional information its a definite NTA.\n\nThis is coming from an avid dog lover that advocates for almost anything besides rehoming the pet, but in this scenario the dog could have just a moment of natural aggression towards your cat and that's all it would take to seriously harm or even kill your cat.", "If you're serious enough to talk about moving in together, you should be able to talk about your concerns over each other's pets.
