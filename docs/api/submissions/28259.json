Around late august. \n\nMe and one friend, lets call her Anna are both in relationships while my other friend, lets call her Stina, is not. Stina likes to sleep around wich I don't have a problem with, what she does with her body is none of my business, but her constant need for male attention can get annoying sometimes. She is known by our friendgroup for running off with some guy, causing everyone to panic, and then crying about us \"leaving her\" and putting her in a dangerous situation. When there is a group of guys around her personality changes drastically and she starts talking the other girls in the group down to seem more appealing, she constantly flirts with guys in relationships, etc. Some people would describe her as a bit of a \"pick me girl\"\n\nSo now you have the context of how Stina is. Lets get to the story. \n\nWe'd all been having a great time partying at the festival, it was around 3am and me and Anna wanted to get back to our tent and call it a night, Stina did not. There was no convincing her to come with us and she had ran into a group of people she knew from her hometown and seemed to be having a good time with them, so we let her know we were leaving and told her to call if there was anything.\n\nAt around 6 am i wake up to laughing, kissing and a lot of movement. I dont feel like making a fuss so i pretend to be asleep untill the guy falls on my back, i lose it and yell at them to get out of the tent and go fuck in the car. The guy gets apologetic, Stina just laughs at me and tells me to chill, they werent doing anything, just waiting for a taxi so they could go to his place wich was semi nearby. There was not gonna be a taxi at this time, in this side of the country, (iceland) during such a big festival for probably 4 hours. I got even angrier and tell them that i dont want this random man in our shared tent, it was far from safe, and if they or him didnt get the fuck out i would call the campsite security. They both got out and i went back to sleep cause i was drunk and had been awake for almost 24 hours. Anna somehow slept through the whole thing, probably since she was really drunk as well.\n\nThe next day there was no sight of Stina. We call her and she says she will get herself back to the city so me and Anna packed all her stuff for her and drove home.\n\nNow more than a month later Stina is still mad at me because I kicked her out of the tent and put her in danger. I never said she had to get out of the tent, i just wanted the man out. My friends say I overreacted because they weren't having sex or anything.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: i realized that from the way i describe her in the post it seems like i overall dislike her, wich i don't. Aside from this quirk of hers she is a very sweet person and i really dont want to lose our friendship over this", "created_utc": 1696501161, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170ebkv/aita_for_not_wanting_a_random_man_in_my_tent/", "score": 1447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's willing to constantly inconvenience her friends and not only put herself in danger which is her choice BUT put YOU and other friends in danger for the sake of Male Validation and put the blame of her chosen danger on you and other friends! Stina is ONLY sweet when men are not around and in all honesty being selectively nice only when it benefits her is not a good quality to have in a friend. And she's deeply immature to not be able to take accountability for any of her actions, why is something always somebody else's fault??\n\n Her pickmeness is not just one quirky trait it's a accumulation of a lot of negativity traits rooted in deep insecurity that will become more and more apparent as the friendship goes on. \n\nAND Girl 101 and just general concert safety, DO NOT BRING RANDOM PEOPLE into your SHARED tent without asking first!!! This girl really thought flirting with some random was more important than her friend's safety, comfortability AND SLEEP! Who gives a dam if they weren't having sex(they definitely were going too) you and your friend were SLEEPING and it was 3AM! You guys are entitled to sleep comfortably and with no one giggling and flirting in the tent. And this girl had the gal to have YOU ALL pack her things for her after all that. If she wanted to go home with others she's responsible over her stuff and shoulda gotten it. \n\nThe reason I'm so serious about this is that I've had friends like Stina. People like Stina are selfish and will constantly put friends in danger for the sake of male validation. It's a \"quirk\" that's excusable until and it will go too far and you or another friend ends up getting physically harmed. \n\nLooking back it was maddening how my friends and I would end up in such shitty situations cuz our current group pickme wanted to impress or chase some guy. It truly was insanity how we kept excusing the girls actions cuz they were decent other times ie when men weren't around \ud83d\ude44. I'd try communicating these issues with these pickmes but it was always in one ear and out the other with no change in behavior. And years later these bitches are exactly the same. Deep insecurity is a hell of an issue and takes a lot to overcome, no excuse for their actions that hurt other people though.\n\nIt needs to be talked about more but girls like this lead other women to danger and will defend the man at the end of the day. It is sooo important to have friends who at bare minimum care about your safety! It doesn't matter how \"nice\" they are sometimes even the worst people have good moments but at the end of the day if your friend doesn't respect you and your boundaries they ARE NOT a good friend!

I\u2019ve known girls who are more than happy to share a tent together and not take it to the city but do it then and there.\n\nAs an extension the guy has no way of knowing how your particular girl group takes to him being there. The onky thing he has is your friend inviting him over, which implies that it\u2019s okay _as usually people agree on these things beforehand_. He assumed that you are adults anf know what you are doing. Assuming that there\u2019s some global ethics code on this is not a realistic pov.

He deserved to be yelled at too, that's rude af.\n\nOP's friend is ALSO in the wrong and earned OP's ire for creating this whole situation. But the dude went into a tent with sleeping people and then fell onto one of them, he isn't innocent here.", "Well, at least you went back on what you said. Cause before everyone disagreed with you, you had said the dude did nothing wrong \ud83d\ude44", "It\u2019s okay to disagree as long as your opinion isn\u2019t dumb. Alas, yours was dumb as shown by constant downvotes on every comment", "It just seems like the courteous thing would have been to ask OP if she was okay with her bringing a guy back to their tent. I don't know why she didn't at least do that.", "It's quite basic to address someone's behavioral issues beforehand when you know you'll be drunk and sharing a sleeping space.", "To you and I, sure. Does she seem like someone who learned the same values?", "The reason it was dangerous is they were in a tent at a fesitival, this means people were probably very intoxicated (vulnerable), they were in their provite tent asleep (very vulnerable and unaware of the situation), and usually these places have bad reception and most of the other people are also very high/drunk (you likely wont be helped in an emergency)..... i think as a woman partying in a setting like this it is important to stay as safe as you can which to me means no strangers in the sleeping place while we are passed out drunk is a given.\n\nI think it is situationally based and there can be times to trust strangers, male and female, this just wasnt one of them at all.", "I assume every man is a threat until proven otherwise. I'd never bring an unknown man home or go to his house. I've met too many seemingly normal men who become dangerous when you're with them alone.", "It\u2019s more that they were drunk, asleep, vulnerable and in an unfamiliar place. Sure three women could probably overpower one man but he could easily grope one of them and run away before any of them are awake enough to know what\u2019s going on.", "Unfortunately men are threats. Girls can't walk down the street without being catcalled or  worse, take a bus or streetcar without being groped and dress how they want without being judged. If anything happening it's our fault. Problem is nobody teaches boys no means no.", "I\u2019m a guy,but I have a pretty good perspective on this issue. I grew up with a twin sister who was considered very attractive and we were teens well before men were being called out for certain behavior. \n\nDude,I\u2019m not kidding,I saw grown men giving her the side eye since she was 9 or 10. Grown ass men would make random comments to her in the grocery store,the bus stop ,on the way to school and everywhere else. Often,I was *right next to her* and nobody was trying to make *me* chuckle! It was chilling. \n\nThis world\u2019s eyes are a little more open these days,but it\u2019s still a jungle out there.", "An average dude probably could take on 3 chicks\u2026 especially if he was crazy and set on doing harm.", "I don't understand what your argument is.\n\nYour initial point hinged on you being pedantic on the specific words used, so your argument here could be used *against* your first comment.\n\nYou seem a very confused person, I wish you the best of luck.", "Dude, you are all over this thread trying to die on the weirdest hill imaginable.", "Ok, boomer.", "I agree that she's owed some peace of mind and body. No argument there. But how rambunctious was he being? How loud was the kissing? How light of a sleeper is OP? Everyone, including myself, is making assumptions and basing our judgements based off of them. I could be wrong, others could be wrong. This is also a one sided story from OP, and in order to get a better picture, we'd need the others sides of it.", "I definitely see that she felt unsafe. No argument from me on that. But if he was invited in, and we don't know if OP's friend lied and said the other women were fine with it, then he might not be at fault. I definitely give the stupid award to OP's friend, and still think OP could have acted more rationally, especially since she was awake and pretending to be asleep. It's not like she was startled awake and reacted suddenly. She had time to acclimatize herself to the situation.", "That's fair, and I should have said that he's not as guilty as OP's friend rather than saying that he's not in the wrong. Again, we don't have more context and probably won't get any, but it could have been accidental as well.", "Yep. It's called personal growth and allowing another person's perspective to change what you think. I still think OP was the AH for reacting as badly as she did to the guy when she should have aimed that at her friend instead. But I do admit that the guy and the friend shouldn't have went into a tent with other people sleeping inside to do anything romantic.", "Lol, popular opinion doesn't measure what's actually dumb or not. It just measures what the masses are thinking which falls under \"group think\". It's an incredibly dangerous way of thinking because you won't consider any other opinions unless they agree with all aspects of what you believe, or what the masses say is ok to believe.", "[removed]", "From OP's post, it sounds like this is a new level of disrespect.\n\nIt's not OP or anyone else's job to spell out this stuff to their friends. The friends behavior is completely inappropriate and OP is in no way at fault for what their friend did.", "I agree with the tent and the sleeping people, I guess I'm having a hard time with gendering the situation?   If I were at a festival and someone barged in my tent while I'm sleeping I would also be upset, and fearful until I knew what was going on.  In much the same way I would have made the inconsiderate couple go somewhere else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess it just makes me really sad that random man=dangerous.  I have second guessed stopping in my car to help someone in distress if they are female, because me stopping might be more stressful than what they are going through.  Every time I've stopped to help a man(or 16yo boy that just needed a boost) it has been a positive experience.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I just want to be pointed at a creepy, rapey guy so I can beat some sense into him and feel like I'm actually helping.", "so, for you, this was a learned defense mechanism to deal with a real and immediate threat, presumably more than once. \n\nWere you told to never trust men?", "does this apply to all situations or just this one in particular? \n\nI am totally on board with this being inappropriate, it was just the way I saw all the top comments talk about it.  Then more stories shared how other similar situations had occurred.  \n\nDo I tell my girls never to be alone with a man?  I'm in the weeds here...", "my parents taught me... I think the nobody statement is a bit of an overreach", "Not confused at all. My point is that in the chaotic heat of the moment when being threatened, people may not understand the complexities of those threats as they go into \"fight or flight\" mode.\n\nMy initial comment was referencing when OP replied to a comment saying that she never wanted her friend to leave. OP replied to that, presumably under a calmer set of circumstances, which contradicted what she actually yelled saying that either he or both of them leave. If she didn't want her friend to leave, then she should have just threatened the guy, not her friend.", "We only get one side, that\u2019s how this works. Op literally says he fell onto her back. If you were Op in this situation, are you really saying you wouldn\u2019t get snippy with him?", "Having a strange man enter your tent can still be startling, even if you\u2019re awake. Having a man fall on top of you, is startling. Getting handsy next to someone that didn\u2019t consent to being next to your canoodling, is not okay. She didn\u2019t owe this dude any pleasantries. Could she have been a little less aggressive? Sure. But dude was still in the wrong in some spots here.", "Oh, OP's friend absolutely sucks more! She's the main asshole. She is the one that owes OP & the other woman consideration because of their friendship, and she's the one who knew it was a shared tent when she brought the guy there.\n\nBut from my POV, even if it was accidental the guy still sucks too. He isn't nearly as responsible for the whole situation, but he went into a tent with sleeping people to make out. It really doesn't matter if the fall was an accident - he still willingly went in there which means he was completely uncaring about if he disturbed them in some way.", "Growth is always good! But you should have let your original comment stand for accountability.", "Again, nobody is gonna consider your opinions as well if it\u2019s stupid", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They don't look a particular way. It is impossible for us to know how a man (generally physically stronger, and more likely to have an unpredictable reaction to rejection) will react. They are all races. They are all heights. They are all ages. Rapists don't have a \"look\".\n\nThe way to help? Teach your daughters that they don't owe politeness to anyone that sets off alarm bells or makes them feel uncomfortable for any reason. Not to hold open the apartment building gate for strangers. That \"no\" is a full sentence. Call out your friends for making objectifying comments or misogynistic jokes. Be the change.", "I would also be upset if the stranger was female. Strangers in personal \"safe space\" while i am intoxicated and sleeping  would make me feel unsafe and vulnerable. The gender plays a role only because around 1 in every 3 women are sexually assualted or coerced by a man in their lifetime, and these particular men tend to go after vulnerable, intoxicated women.", "Yes, I was told that, like every woman is. Then I ignored that warning, like every woman does, and found out the hard way that the women who warned me were in fact correct.", "You're obviously having a pretty tough time with this concept based on your comments, so I'd say the wisest thing to do is just to find someone who can be a trusted role model for your girls and have that person teach them safety. You should also learn about it, but for their sake, have someone who knows the subject teach them until you can get up to speed.\n\nSome safety tips for girls:\n\n- Don't be alone with a man you don't know and trust if you're in a vulnerable state (intoxicated, drugged, asleep, physically disabled). (Edit: When I say \"don't be alone,\" I mean there should be at least one other person there whom you trust, and that person should ALSO not be vulnerable or impaired.)\n- Always have a way to reach out for help, whether that be a phone, or being in public with other people around\n- Professional settings are *generally* (not always) safer than private settings because they are less isolated and because there are likely (but not guaranteed) professional consequences for bad behavior\n- That said, harassment can still happen in professional settings. Document everything, and know whom you need to report to (e.g. if a doctor abuses you, where to report the doctor; if a boss abuses you, how to get in touch with HR and/or Legal and/or how to get your own legal representation)\n- Isolation is more dangerous than being surrounded by strangers, and being surrounded by strangers is more dangerous than being surrounded by good friends\n- In general, try to keep yourself in such situations that if someone hurts you, there will be immediate consequences for that person\n- Always keep an eye on your drink in any situation where strangers have access to it. If you let it out of your sight, discard it and get a new one. Restaurants are generally fine because you're usually there with other people and nobody's really trying to roofie people at Applebee's. But bars and college parties are places where you can never leave a drink unattended.\n- Just generally, if you're in a place where people are looking to get laid, be aware that anyone could be looking to get laid *without your consent.* \n- Always know what's in every drink you drink. Don't let someone hand you a drink that you haven't witnessed being made. \n- Use the buddy system. Always go to dangerous or even *potentially dangerous* places with someone else you trust, and don't break off from the group.", "I wouldn't get snippy with him, I would get snippy with the friend. OP says this has happened multiple times with this friend, so I don't know why she's not more mad at her friend.", "That's fair, and those are all good points. I still think the majority of the anger should have been directed at the friend, and not the guy though.", "I agree with that.", "The top comment wasn't edited and someone quoted the unedited comment in their response so it's all good. Don't worry, I think people will keep downvoting my comments if that's what you're concerned about.\n\nPersonally, I don't care how many upvotes/downvotes I get. I state my opinion and am open to discussion, changing my opinion when a good argument comes along that convinces me of something else.", "Again, judging moral arguments based off of group think isn't smart. If you close yourself off from other opinions because they're going against what the group thinks, you're closing yourself off from growing as a person in a healthy way.\n\nI could be wrong, I've admitted that in other comments. But I could be right as well. We disagree on this topic and that's ok in my eyes. We both have the opportunity to be challenged on our standpoint. I'm trying to take in what others are saying, and admitting where I think they're right and trying to clarify my opinion where needed. You're just telling me my opinion is stupid and reasoning that by the downvotes I've received. That doesn't mean that I'm wrong, it just means I'm in a thread where the majority disagrees with me.", "our workplace actually has that exact mandate in place.  I work in a historically male only environment and getting the \"good 'ol boys\" to grow the fuck up has been a challenge.  My girls will have the confidence and the knowledge to stay safe, and I will use your description to warn them.  \n\ncalling out friends misogyny usually doesn't have the intended result of swaying minds, but I feel I'm probably better off without those friends in my life.  On the flip side who else in their life will be the one to stand up to that behavior...", "This makes me fearful as a parent, and angry.  Is this a bad apple scenario or do most women agree that pretty much any man can/will become hostile given the \"right\" situation?", "That is incredibly disheartening.  I hope you were able to move on from that trauma and be successful in whatever way you desired", "How about this then? Say you and a friend share a room, ie in an apartment or dorm. If that friend brings in strangers you aren\u2019t the least bit concerned?", "Changes like this often have to start small. But thank you. It is sad that it takes a man to get through to men who are like that, but we appreciate real allies. It may not make a difference today with one particular friend, but he heard it from you. And maybe he will hear it again, and again, and maybe eventually it will start to get through. If it helps even one person even a little bit, it was worth it.", "No, it's just that you can't tell in a glance who the bad apple will be. It's similar to worrying about being robbed, but with additional physical/mental consequences. You can't tell by looking who might be a thief. You want to believe that no one you know would do it, but you still don't leave your wallet sitting out everywhere you go. You don't expect that just because you left your wallet out, that someone who wouldn't normally do such a thing will suddenly turn into a thief.", "If it's any comfort, I'm not alone. But me and most other women on the planet thank you.", "Honestly, not really. I've been in that situation where I shared a room and my roommate had girls over that I didn't know. I've been in similar situations where I woke up to my roommate and the woman having a little too much fun and I either would ignore it or ask them to finish up soon so I could get back to sleep.\n\nBut again, I hadn't disagreed with that aspect of this post in any of my comments. I do get her being frustrated, scared, and concerned. I think she just took it out on the wrong person.", "Got it. That makes sense.  But isn't there a statistic that most women know the perpetrators?  Maybe that's for child abduction..."]}
