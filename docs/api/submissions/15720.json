Just to begin this, I firmly believe once you\u2019re married or even in a committed relationship, the \u201cmy money is your money\u201d saying applies. \n\nAnywho, my husband has been struggling with mental health issues (ADHD and severe anxiety) on and off for about 3 years now and it\u2019s gotten BAD when we moved back to our hometown about 2 years ago. He had a great paying job and would take days off here and there because of this, but overall enjoyed going and had no other issues. Fast forward to approx 19 months ago we found out I was preggo (now have a 9 month old). All of a sudden he couldn\u2019t hold a job, would get a job and not even be able to go on the first day and was just lying to everyone about it (he\u2019d tell his mom or whoever he\u2019d been working). Eventually it got to a point where his account was overdrawn and he kept needing to borrow money from his mom. Just to be clear, I pay rent, utilities, groceries, both of our phone bills, his credit card payments all from my maternity leave money. The only things he\u2019s responsible for are his truck payments and his insurance. His mom was giving him money every month for this but he kept spending it on beer and weed and so he\u2019d need to keep borrowing more and last week she finally cut him off. \n\nI had been BEGGING him to see a therapist this entire time and he has ADH and anxiety medication but with the drinking I\u2019m not sure if it even works properly. \n\nAnyhow here\u2019s the AITA part. On top of being in the hole and not being able to dig himself out, instead of continuing to look for work or help provide for his family, he sleeps in and rarely helps with our son and when he does he\u2019s so frustrated when our son is fussy and gives up. My dad has been sending me $20 here and there to do things for myself because I\u2019m so stressed and I saved enough to get my hair done for the first time in years. My husband is now calling me an AH because I won\u2019t give him the $150 I\u2019ve saved to help with his truck payment and instead want to do something for me and get my hair done.

Your husband is allowing his disorder to take over both your lives and he has to make changes. It's very common for people with ADHD and anxiety to self medicate with rec drugs and you are correct that this will be affecting the results of his other medications. I'm not a doctor, but I live this. I can tell you what helped me but ultimately your husband needs to desire, seek, and find his own help. Boundaries are an act of love - it is both reasonable and demonstrates that you care about him - and you need to not accept this wretched behaviour.

He will continue to drain you emotionally and financially.", "Maybe he used to be a good person.  He isn't being one now.  He's being abusive.\n\nHonestly, this reads like he is a garden-variety financial abuser who is using his issues as an excuse to freeload off of everyone.

All of a sudden he couldn\u2019t hold a job...\n\nYou may think this is unique to your husband because of his particular issues, but it is pretty common for a partner's worst traits to manifest with the first pregnancy or birth of the first child.

Divorce doesn't need to be about you stopping loving him-- you can love who an addict was before their illness took over and the  best thing to do is still not to live with them. There is an inherent trauma that children of addicts often deal with, even if their addicted parent isn't an angry drunk, because substances affect your reasoning abilities. Do what's best for your child, even if you still love him.", "Good luck!", "No there's not", "It's not mooching.
