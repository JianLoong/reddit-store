Just to begin this, I firmly believe once you\u2019re married or even in a committed relationship, the \u201cmy money is your money\u201d saying applies. \n\nAnywho, my husband has been struggling with mental health issues (ADHD and severe anxiety) on and off for about 3 years now and it\u2019s gotten BAD when we moved back to our hometown about 2 years ago. He had a great paying job and would take days off here and there because of this, but overall enjoyed going and had no other issues. Fast forward to approx 19 months ago we found out I was preggo (now have a 9 month old). All of a sudden he couldn\u2019t hold a job, would get a job and not even be able to go on the first day and was just lying to everyone about it (he\u2019d tell his mom or whoever he\u2019d been working). Eventually it got to a point where his account was overdrawn and he kept needing to borrow money from his mom. Just to be clear, I pay rent, utilities, groceries, both of our phone bills, his credit card payments all from my maternity leave money. The only things he\u2019s responsible for are his truck payments and his insurance. His mom was giving him money every month for this but he kept spending it on beer and weed and so he\u2019d need to keep borrowing more and last week she finally cut him off. \n\nI had been BEGGING him to see a therapist this entire time and he has ADH and anxiety medication but with the drinking I\u2019m not sure if it even works properly. \n\nAnyhow here\u2019s the AITA part. On top of being in the hole and not being able to dig himself out, instead of continuing to look for work or help provide for his family, he sleeps in and rarely helps with our son and when he does he\u2019s so frustrated when our son is fussy and gives up. My dad has been sending me $20 here and there to do things for myself because I\u2019m so stressed and I saved enough to get my hair done for the first time in years. My husband is now calling me an AH because I won\u2019t give him the $150 I\u2019ve saved to help with his truck payment and instead want to do something for me and get my hair done.

Your husband is allowing his disorder to take over both your lives and he has to make changes. It's very common for people with ADHD and anxiety to self medicate with rec drugs and you are correct that this will be affecting the results of his other medications. I'm not a doctor, but I live this. I can tell you what helped me but ultimately your husband needs to desire, seek, and find his own help. Boundaries are an act of love - it is both reasonable and demonstrates that you care about him - and you need to not accept this wretched behaviour. (Not saying he is a bad person, I deeply know his pain but also come the FRIG on my man, this is NOT who you wanna be.) \n\nEDIT: to add advice - finding the right balance of meds for ADHD+anxiety is tricky because the thing that usually works best for ADHD (stimulant) can aggravate anxiety. Personally I have not yet found an anxiety medication that works better than cannabis, but I managed to cut out drinking and lying and harm reduction is a good model that works for most people so I'm happy with myself and my progress. I'm talking to my doctor about how to transition off cannabis onto something else. (I'm lucky to live somewhere it's legal and I can do that, also I don't have to pay money to see my doctor.) Most anxiety meds say you shouldn't drink so there's a lot of them I was scared to try until I was confident about not drinking. (Another fun little way anxiety traps you in anxiety.) \nMeds lose their effectiveness even if you are using them right. \n\nMeds aren't magic, you have to pay attention to yourself, make good choices, and build new pathways. Your brain is a big magic electric meatsack that can do souch more than we know but it only works if you work it.\n\n Good luck to you both!

You no longer have a partner. All these people telling you to issue an ultimatum are right. He's pissing away the money his mother gives him and not bringing any other money into the house.

I  think you've sunk enough energy into this worthless pit.", "This is not someone who you should be married to. NTA, I hope you take care of yourself and your baby and do what is best for you!", "19 months of this sort of behavior is, FYI, easily a justification for divorce.  You're NTA.

They will take you down with them without a care. \n\nMy situation was different but similar with my ex developing bipolar and refusing to get real help.

Drinking will absolutely affect medication. and if he's sneaking off to drink and neglecting stuff... he's on a bad path.

Give him an ultimatum and stick with it or file for divorce. Either way you\u2019re going to be in debt for the rest of your life if he doesn\u2019t get it together. And the fact that he\u2019s showing frustration towards a baby for crying is alarming and itself and you should watch that. He\u2019s a bum who smokes weed constantly and can\u2019t hold down a job and can\u2019t contribute financially to your household who is taking advantage of you.

Go see a lawyer OP.", "NTA.  I have sympathy for him dealing with mental health issues, but at some point, you have to realize it would be easier on your own.  He's not contributing to the household or childcare in anyway, you and his mother have been paying all his bills.

Do you know if you can MAKE someone check into rehab or get other forms of help?", "Thank you so so much this was very helpful. I\u2019ve spoken with him and together we\u2019re going to look up the effects of alcohol with the two medications he\u2019s taking. My issue now is I said if they don\u2019t mix with your medication (I know they don\u2019t), will you give up alcohol? And he said he\u2019ll think about it.

Depending on what medications he\u2019s on, the alcohol is likely going to cause him to become depressed sending him into a downward spiral if the weed hasn\u2019t already negated the effects of the medication anyway. IIRC smoking weed with adderall or Ritalin can increase your chances of psychotics episodes as well, but I\u2019m not 100% on that. Ultimately, the longer it goes on, the worse it\u2019s going to get. If he\u2019s only just been diagnosed and treated three years ago, he\u2019s gonna have detrimental behaviours that he\u2019s lived with his entire life as a result of being untreated, and that\u2019s more than likely going to take a therapist to unlearn. I was diagnosed and treated for ADHD two years ago, and although taking medication every day has significantly improved my life, I still have bad habits that are going to take time to break.

He knows you'll keep taking care of him, so why change? \n\nYou should separate from him for now. At this point you are a single mom of two toddlers since he's behaving like this, and its not fair that he's putting all the management of his mental health on you.

Be the mom he deserves.", "Believe me, FROM EXPERIENCE, people like this always figure out a way to take advantage of someone else.

Never again. Besides, depending on the medication it can be really dangerous. Mine says that it can lead to stopped breathing if you drink too much.
