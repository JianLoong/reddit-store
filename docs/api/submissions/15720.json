Just to begin this, I firmly believe once you\u2019re married or even in a committed relationship, the \u201cmy money is your money\u201d saying applies. \n\nAnywho, my husband has been struggling with mental health issues (ADHD and severe anxiety) on and off for about 3 years now and it\u2019s gotten BAD when we moved back to our hometown about 2 years ago. He had a great paying job and would take days off here and there because of this, but overall enjoyed going and had no other issues. Fast forward to approx 19 months ago we found out I was preggo (now have a 9 month old). All of a sudden he couldn\u2019t hold a job, would get a job and not even be able to go on the first day and was just lying to everyone about it (he\u2019d tell his mom or whoever he\u2019d been working). Eventually it got to a point where his account was overdrawn and he kept needing to borrow money from his mom. Just to be clear, I pay rent, utilities, groceries, both of our phone bills, his credit card payments all from my maternity leave money. The only things he\u2019s responsible for are his truck payments and his insurance. His mom was giving him money every month for this but he kept spending it on beer and weed and so he\u2019d need to keep borrowing more and last week she finally cut him off. \n\nI had been BEGGING him to see a therapist this entire time and he has ADH and anxiety medication but with the drinking I\u2019m not sure if it even works properly. \n\nAnyhow here\u2019s the AITA part. On top of being in the hole and not being able to dig himself out, instead of continuing to look for work or help provide for his family, he sleeps in and rarely helps with our son and when he does he\u2019s so frustrated when our son is fussy and gives up. My dad has been sending me $20 here and there to do things for myself because I\u2019m so stressed and I saved enough to get my hair done for the first time in years. My husband is now calling me an AH because I won\u2019t give him the $150 I\u2019ve saved to help with his truck payment and instead want to do something for me and get my hair done.

Your husband is allowing his disorder to take over both your lives and he has to make changes. It's very common for people with ADHD and anxiety to self medicate with rec drugs and you are correct that this will be affecting the results of his other medications. I'm not a doctor, but I live this. I can tell you what helped me but ultimately your husband needs to desire, seek, and find his own help. Boundaries are an act of love - it is both reasonable and demonstrates that you care about him - and you need to not accept this wretched behaviour. (Not saying he is a bad person, I deeply know his pain but also come the FRIG on my man, this is NOT who you wanna be.) \n\nEDIT: to add advice - finding the right balance of meds for ADHD+anxiety is tricky because the thing that usually works best for ADHD (stimulant) can aggravate anxiety. Personally I have not yet found an anxiety medication that works better than cannabis, but I managed to cut out drinking and lying and harm reduction is a good model that works for most people so I'm happy with myself and my progress. I'm talking to my doctor about how to transition off cannabis onto something else. (I'm lucky to live somewhere it's legal and I can do that, also I don't have to pay money to see my doctor.) Most anxiety meds say you shouldn't drink so there's a lot of them I was scared to try until I was confident about not drinking. (Another fun little way anxiety traps you in anxiety.) \nMeds lose their effectiveness even if you are using them right. \n\nMeds aren't magic, you have to pay attention to yourself, make good choices, and build new pathways. Your brain is a big magic electric meatsack that can do souch more than we know but it only works if you work it.\n\n Good luck to you both!

But I need to share something. I have Panic Disorder and PTSD after dealing with years of trauma earlier on. The Panic Disorder is treatment resistant. For nearly two decades I have tried every medication that I could, done so many different types of therapy the list is kinda shocking. When that didn't work I tried self help stuff and support group programs etc. while continuing with psychology. I have never given up and continue searching for new things to try even though I'm exhausted. \n\nMy Panic Disorder is severe and is a psychosocial disability despite what I've done to try to treat it. I also have a chronic physical condition that causes chronic pain and other issues. So what do I do with my days? I keep our house immaculate. I do all the housework, I weed the garden and I make sure that my husband's only job is actually going to work. I do 100% of the emotional labour and 100% of the running of the household, bills, financial management, savings plans etc.  I do all the chores, all the laundry. With my free time, knowing that boredom is my enemy I taught myself three seperate hobbies that help me manage with my daily panic attacks. I do not drink. Not a drop. I do not do recreational drugs. Addiction cravings have been proven to make anxiety worse. Alcohol is a depressant so it'll make depression worse.  \n\nI have the nausea variety of panic attacks and I panic daily. I fight to keep my weight up as a result. Still, I do the housework and cooking and stuff around the attacks and around my chronic pain. There are days when I can barely be upright with my pain. I catch up on housework when I'm better and I meal prep so that if I'm laid flat for a whole day or even two it doesn't affect the running of the household. \n\nThere are many ways to contribute to a household. We're lucky enough to be able to live off one income. But even without working, my contribution to the household is huge. My husband goes to work and then he comes home to all chores already done, groceries sorted, meals sorted. \n\nYour husband needs to do something to get help and alcohol and weed need to be banned from your house asap. The timeline for that shift should be set by a medical professional. Aside from the medical issues with alcohol and meds, alcohol is expensive. If he can't afford his truck payment he can't afford beer. That's it. No negotiation. \n\nPlease don't drive yourself into exhaustion. There's empathy, then there's enabling. There's mental illness and then there is addiction and a refusal to seek help. And I also only have a flight and freeze response. That's not a reason to not get help. Geez even on YouTube there are videos that show you how you can breathe and move and assist yourself when in one of these states.\n\nGet your haircut and enjoy. Then give your husband an ultimatum. He either gets help and contributes or he's out. There are so many treatments for anxiety. I've tried dozens and dozens.

You are taking a lot of responsibility and stress onto your shoulders.  It isn't fair and you have every right to be frustrated.  You also have every right to treat yourself to luxuries.  That would be no matter what your husband's financial or health situation was.  In case no one tells you, you are doing a great job and you deserve to have your husband step up, get the help he needs, get a job and help you.\n\nConcerning your husband, you mentioned his mental health struggles being in the last three years and especially after you moved to 'our' (so I am assuming his as well) hometown.  Has he always had some history of mental health struggles?  Is there anything (job situation, life situation, loss, etc) that happened three years ago?  Is there anything you know of that is traumatic connected to this hometown that happened to him or that he went through at any point in his life?\n\nThe reason I ask is it sounds a lot like your husband has had something specific that set off this mental health struggle.  It might have been an event that happened three years ago that has just gotten worse because he didn't address it.  It might have been losing someone or experiencing an interaction that reminded him of something.  The reason I mention your hometown is because you specifically said it got worst after moving there.  I am not in any way shape or form licensed or certified to diagnose, but this is just my own experience both struggling with mental illness and watching loved ones who do too.\n\nThis still doesn't excuse him not helping.  Having mental health issues is the same as having any other issues.  The illness is just as valid, but it also means you are responsible for getting yourself help.  You are also responsible for the level to which you let your struggle become the struggle of your loved ones.  There is so often the focus on supporting those with mental health issues.  The people supporting those people needs sympathy and encouragement as well.  So, again, your emotions and needs in all this are valid.\n\nI agree with others to give him the ultimatum of either finally getting help or realizing what it means for the future of your relationship.  Decide yourself if that means separation with a chance to possibly work through it or divorce.  Nobody can tell you what the right choice in this situation.  It is a situation you are in and that is affecting you and your son.  So if/when anyone else shares a negative opinion on how you are handling this/yourself, do not give it thought.  I also suggest couple's therapy or at the very least therapy for yourself too.\n\nI know, easier said than done, but you deserve to put you and your son first.  If you can't do it for yourself then do it for your son who deserves to have a father who doesn't get annoyed by him being a child.

It helped her decide if she wanted to stay with her husband because she loved him and not because she felt trapped by him. \n\nOn the other hand. Her husband didn't drink.
