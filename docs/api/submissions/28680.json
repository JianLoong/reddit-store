If they didn't think you were responsible, they wouldn't have asked.\n\nBut, maybe they're not loved ones for you, and you gave them more than enough notice, and your mom either lied to your sister, or was just in complete denial about all this. She handled all this poorly. Sometimes, it's justified to be an asshole. You have every right, and have given ample notice, that you should be excused from babysitting. \n\nIf she has the means to pay someone, she should be able to find someone qualified to do it. If I was you though, I would regret not doing this for her, only because I like children, and I cherish every moment I get with my nephews and nieces. If you don't have that desire though, all good. However, I think it will always be an asshole thing to say you don't *like* kids, which is different from saying you don't *want* kids.", "Hahaa good Response", "Why would just not wanting to babysit for two years, twice a week make you an asshole? That\u2019s a huge ask from anybody, but asking this from someone you don\u2019t have a relationship with  and who doesn\u2019t even like kids is beyond unreasonable. If the mom thinks her daughter is owed childcare, she should do it. She shouldn\u2019t try to force someone else to do this."]}
