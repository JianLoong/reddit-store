Her car isn't though and it is currently at the mechanic for repairs. I give her a lift to work in the morning and she usually gets back home on her own.\n\nThe other day, I had a rather long day at work. I texted Eve and asked her if she wanted me to pick her up so we could go home together. She said yes. She's a doctor and works at the hospital. I got there and I texted her where I was. I waited for half an hour and there was no response other than I'll be there shortly.\n\nI've never really been inside the hospital and she hasn't been to my workplace as well. We never discussed this there was just no need for it. Eve has always managed to keep work and home life very separate and prides herself in doing that.\n\nAnuway our kids' sitter's time was going to be over in a short while so at least one of us needed to be home soon. I called her, texted her and still no response after half an hour. I got worried so I got into the hospital, and asked for her. They didn't just tell me so I introduced myself as her wife.\n\nI waited inside for 15 minutes and learned that they had an emergency and she had rushed into the OR for a patient. Eve finally came and we went to my car. She asked me what I was doing and I explained the situation. \n\nShe got really angry and said she didn't really want everyone to know about her private life at work. I was really confused because from her tone, it felt like she didn't want people to know we were a couple, let alone married. \n\nShe kept pushing that if they knew her spouse was a woman she wouldn't hear the end of it from her coworkers. She said she didn't want me to be dragged in the middle of this and that her workplace was toxic at best. I may be TA here because I got mad and went on a rant about us being together for 11 godd*mn years, having two kids and that being a fact, not something to be ashamed.\n\nThe argument went on, and even after we got home, I can't bring myself to accept that she sees this as a liability. Eve tried to apologise but I  still can't let this go. My friend told me she works in a ridiculously male dominated field of speciality and her concerns were valid. Was I being an AH?

But you'll run into more situations like this inevitably, that's just life as a couple and parent, I've seen my parents navigate parents not wanting one of my moms on the pta because she \"wasn't really my mom\" (the 90s).

Maybe the two of you can find a way to get her out of that toxic environment so you can live your lives openly.", "NTA~ you didn\u2019t know that her coworkers weren\u2019t aware of your existence. I can understand why finding out like that would hurt.\n\nEven though she absolutely should have told you, your wife isn\u2019t wrong for wanting to keep her home & work life separate. I wouldn\u2019t take it personally.  Being a woman in a \u201cboys club\u201d work environment is a constant uphill battle. I don\u2019t doubt that your wife is correct in thinking that her being a \u2728queer woman \u2728 could add to the imbalance. It\u2019s bullshit, but it\u2019s true. \n\nCommunication is key in resolving this & ensuring something similar doesn\u2019t happen in the future. Good luck!", "Nta she hiding something deeper.", "She should report anyone harassing her about her sexuality, because it is literally not safe to have homophobes working in a hospital where lgbt+ patients come through. Being secretly closeted when you\u2019re married is an asshole move to the spouse, too. OP is NTA for being hurt about being kept a secret.", "We fight back and normalize it, not keep our spouses secret.", "It\u2019s not fine. Homophobes shouldn\u2019t be allowed to work in hospitals. It\u2019s not safe for gay patients. OP has an obligation to report coworkers with dangerous beliefs.", "Yeah, with the sitter issue I would have just said \"I was here, but I have to go get Kiddo - let me know if you want us to swing back by to get you otherwise see you at home!\"\n\nI might be concerned something was wrong if I didn't get an answer from my spouse, but knowing her profession emergencies are probably not uncommon.", "I bet the wife is an ortho, it's such a boys' club", "NTA but if she does not want you to out her at work , then you should respect her wishes. Outing someone against their wishes is not ok.", "INFO:\n\n> Eve has always managed to keep work and home life very separate and prides herself in doing that.\n\nWhy would that be something to be particularly proud of?", "NAH\n\nSounds like your wife is a surgeon? The specialty has stereotypically been toxic, male-dominated, and conservative. Her colleagues knowing about her private life could potentially make daily work and career advancement more difficult. So her concerns are valid. And yours are, too. (Also I imagine if she were mid-operation when the hospital called her, the person taking the call likely just yelled out across the OR that her wife is waiting for her in front of everyone). \n\nIt just sounds like unfortunate timing and a communication gap.", "Nta but I can see your wife's side, every nursing facility I have worked at whether it be a hospital or nursing home, is nothing but drama amongst coworkers. It feels like high school all over again except 10x worse. I just want to give you insight and validate that what your wife is saying does actually happen.", "NTA. And the reason is if she's in the closet her spouse needs to know about it. What if something happened to her and you had to deal with her work? \n\nHell what happens if she ends up injured at her workplace. \n\nAlso being in the closet is a deal breaker for more than one LGBT person I know. \n\nHell if she had been honest you could have known for sure to just go home after 20 minutes or something.", "NAH. It\u2019s unfortunate for you both, but it\u2019s your wife who will have to deal with this everyday, as well as the shame of hiding it. The problem isn\u2019t with your wife, it\u2019s society. You\u2019re a team, don\u2019t forget that", "> maybe has the so-called work wife.\n\nOr work husband.", "Not to mention, many hospital systems are faith based and therefore can skirt some of the rules. Based on handbook bylaws, codes of conduct, etc. She could also know that this would get her the garbage shifts, or prevent her from advancing, getting better equipment or staff, etc", "She's a surgeon, she most likely can afford to Uber home. I'd be mad if I waited 30 minutes to pick someone up and they were taking out an appendix and I'm sitting there like an idiot. Do I think my 30 minutes is more important than another person dying? No. \n\nHowever, I would appreciate my time being respected. a surgery tech could text OP and tell them the situation while they do their job. No one needs to know the relationship as long as it doesn't say \"wife\" if the contact info.", "okay", "Maybe she should just (wo)man up.  If she has the intestinal fortitude to become and work as a surgeon, she most certainly has the cojones to stand up to other people for being gay.  What if there is a work gala?  Would you not be invited by her, or are you passed off as her plutonic friend?  At some point, you have to stand up for yourself and, more importantly, for the ones you love.  NTA.", "NTA", "Nah. Yeah, I can see why that stung. And it\u2019s shitty she feels the need to hide at work. But some workplaces are not safe places to come out. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by coming to her workplace, because it seems like she never communicated that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that.", "If your wife doesn't feel she can be safely or comfortably out at work, you do not get to be upset with her for it. Have you forgotten about hate crimes? YTA.", "NTA. What\u2019s happens if there is an emergency at work for either of them? What\u2019s happens if one of the children has an accident? Not being honest about her work life is a recipe for disaster. If OP had not found out about spouse being in the closet at work, could she even be considered a \u201cspouse\u201d? What about the legality of the relationship? OP has every right to be upset not being told spouse was not \u201cout\u201d at work.", "This! Eve is a huge AH for never bringing this up at home", "She should have sent a message.   What I fear is that if OP left she would be in trouble with the wife.  If she doesn't solve the problem caused by her wife's poor communication and somewhat selfish attitude about time, then she is rude to the babysitter.\n\nI would say NAH, but really the biggest issue is the partner's poor communication about both the delay and about the situation at work.", "Report to who? The hospital board? They\u2019re notorious for being the reason hospitals are toxic workplace environments", "I on the other hand know plenty of surface level details about my coworkers. I usually know the ones that are in a serious relationship, rough ages of kids, pets, and/or a hobby or two.\n\nI don't know their deepest fears and secrets or if they're fighting with their spouse or their day to day personal details and accomplishments. But they are allowed to be human at work so after a while I tend to have a small collection of surface level personal details about their life.", "Maybe she was afraid that leaving would just cause the wife to call her an AH.  A lot of people are afraid of their partner's reactions to reasonable things."]}
