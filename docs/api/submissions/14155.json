She is an amazing person but her behavior the other day honestly left me speechless.\n\nEve got into an accident last week. Thankfully she is perfectly fine. Her car isn't though and it is currently at the mechanic for repairs. I give her a lift to work in the morning and she usually gets back home on her own.\n\nThe other day, I had a rather long day at work. I texted Eve and asked her if she wanted me to pick her up so we could go home together. She said yes. She's a doctor and works at the hospital. I got there and I texted her where I was. I waited for half an hour and there was no response other than I'll be there shortly.\n\nI've never really been inside the hospital and she hasn't been to my workplace as well. We never discussed this there was just no need for it. Eve has always managed to keep work and home life very separate and prides herself in doing that.\n\nAnuway our kids' sitter's time was going to be over in a short while so at least one of us needed to be home soon. I called her, texted her and still no response after half an hour. I got worried so I got into the hospital, and asked for her. They didn't just tell me so I introduced myself as her wife.\n\nI waited inside for 15 minutes and learned that they had an emergency and she had rushed into the OR for a patient. Eve finally came and we went to my car. She asked me what I was doing and I explained the situation. \n\nShe got really angry and said she didn't really want everyone to know about her private life at work. I was really confused because from her tone, it felt like she didn't want people to know we were a couple, let alone married. \n\nShe kept pushing that if they knew her spouse was a woman she wouldn't hear the end of it from her coworkers. She said she didn't want me to be dragged in the middle of this and that her workplace was toxic at best. I may be TA here because I got mad and went on a rant about us being together for 11 godd*mn years, having two kids and that being a fact, not something to be ashamed.\n\nThe argument went on, and even after we got home, I can't bring myself to accept that she sees this as a liability. Eve tried to apologise but I  still can't let this go. My friend told me she works in a ridiculously male dominated field of speciality and her concerns were valid. Was I being an AH? I feel like I am losing my mind?", "created_utc": 1680801738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dr7q6/aita_for_showing_up_at_my_wifes_workplace/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were valid in your concern about her and walking into the hospital to check in on her. And she is right in trying to safeguard her personal life from a system and space that will be discriminatory and potentially even hostile upon learning her sexuality and marital relationship. \n\nIt is super concerning though how you both have spent 11 years not ever discussing the toxicity and duplicity of working in the industry that she is in and how she might have to safeguard and keep her personal life away from her work life. \n\nIt is easy to assume that she is embarrassed of you or your relation but as someone who has known people in medical field it is equally possible she did it to not create a hostile environment for herself or to avoid people making unwarranted comments about you and her relationship. This could be a big emotional and psychological toll. You both need to sit and talk. Check in on why she felt exposed with your visit and if she is keeping her sexuality hidden and work and how that would make you feel. \n\nNot ever queer person wants to be an activist at their work; it is a hard battle up hill and shouldn't be their burden to fight always.", "NTA because she never told you **not** to come to work. So my guess is she's in the closet or maybe has the so-called work wife. See if you can get an honest explanation. If it's a male dominated field, if it's a gossipy work place, there might be a more innocent reason.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but I find it curious that in 11 years, neither of you have ever visited the other person\u2019s place of business. Have you met any of her coworkers and vice versa? It seems like there is a very long history of keeping your personal life together and your professional lives completely separate.", "NAH.  You both have what appear to be legitimate concerns.  When things are calmer, talk them through.  It may be she\u2019s seen a track record of discrimination and is seeking to avoid it.", "NTA. You had a need to know what was happening- and whether you needed to stay or leave.\n\nHer response is worrisome. You need to talk to her about it.", "INFO Where do you live? In a lot of ways it doesn't matter because there are biggots everywhere but some places make it easier to be openly biggoted.\n\nDo the two of you never discuss work?", "NTA.\n\nAnd if you did accidentally out her by going in, that's on her, for not telling her wife of 9 years that she's still in the closet at work and hiding your existence from her coworkers.", "NTA. because you had no idea she wanted you to obscure your relationship with her when you inquired about her at work. \n\nWhat strikes me is your utter lack of intimacy or communication. Frankly. But I don't think you did anything wrong this time. If you continue to out her knowing she doesn't want that? Different story.", "It honestly just sounds like your wife doesn't want to deal with anyone who is toxic in her workplace. It doesn't make her ashamed or embarrassed but she just doesn't want to be harassed about her sexuality especially if it's male dominated. Women can also be cruel in that as well.", "NTA\n\nYou expressed your emotions and feelings to your partner, which is appropriate. And you were valid.\n\nShe's only mad that you basically outted her at work probably, either as a wlw or as a person who's married. I hope for your sake it's the former and not the latter.\n\nI'd recommend working with a couples counselor if you can't get past your hurt.", "NTA. She is clearly embarrassed of the relationship in some way. Is there any way she isn\u2019t out to her colleagues at work?", "ESH. You went wrong when you went on a rant and continued the argument even after the apology. I understand why you went inside and why it makes you angry but I also understand why she might not want people at work to know because of this - \"My friend told me she works in a ridiculously male dominated field of speciality and her concerns were valid\". Maybe she is not outed at work because she knows it won't be accepted by her colleagues and it is not a safe or comfortable environment for her to come out. That does not mean she is ashamed of you but she should have told you earlier that she did not come out at her workplace yet.", "NTA. It sounds like she\u2019s ashamed of her sexual orientation. In this day and age, as far as I can tell, most people don\u2019t care who you\u2019re sleeping/in love with.", "As the child of two women I have to go with NTA. I understand where eve is coming from, she seems less ashamed and more protective. But you didn't know what she expected in that situation, your focus was on your kids as it should have been. And I agree with what others are saying that communication between you two relating to work needs to happen. But you'll run into more situations like this inevitably, that's just life as a couple and parent, I've seen my parents navigate parents not wanting one of my moms on the pta because she \"wasn't really my mom\" (the 90s). So male dominated work environments aren't going to be the only places you might run into friction because unfortunately intolerant people just exist. But I think you should accept your wife's apology and talk.", "Her response sounds like she\u2019s ashamed of the relationship", "ESH.\n\nYou for being in a same-sex relationship for 11 years and not understanding that homophobia is a real thing. I mean, you insisted she must be ashamed about your relationship rather than undrstanding that there are workplaces where knowledge of a same-sex spouse could make that person's life a living hell.\n\nHer for never having spoken to you about this before. Had she told you how toxic her workplace is to queer people, then you would've been forewarned and forearmed about it, rather than blindsided by it.\n\nBut TBH, you must know that people can be gigantic AH about queer people. Patients may even say they \"don't want to gay doctor\" or other BS like that. I'm kind of surprised that you're surprised that there are many unsafe places for queer people...", "Your wife is a homophobe", "NAH because you weren't in the wrong, but your wife is understandable.\n\nThat said, if she didn't want anyone at work to know about her being married to a woman, she ought to have told you this. She has reasonable, if very sad, concerns. I'm sure you two could've worked this out if you'd been clued in on it. But she can't be mad at you for breaking \"rules\" that you didn't know existed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It makes sense that she might not be able to answer your text right away. Unless you thought she was injured or something you had no reason to go in. I\u2019m not even addressing whether her coworkers know about you or not. That\u2019s a whole other issue but I don\u2019t see why you had to go in when your wife is a doctor. You know she can\u2019t always talk when she\u2019s literally dealing with patients all day. Why try to rush her out? You could have just waited or texted her that you were going home to relieve the sitter and she could call you when she could.", "NTA-\nThe real root of it is consent.  Had she told you about her concerns regarding her work beforehand, how she didn't want them to know due to politics in the workplace, and you had a chance to give feedback.\n\nInstead, you come across as your wife's shameful secret, and that must have hurt a lot.\n\nOn a level of this I recommend couples therapy of some sort.", "The AH here are your wife's toxic homophobic colleagues.  \n\nI'm sorry you have to put up with this.  \n\nNTA", ">It is super concerning though how you both have spent 11 years not ever discussing the toxicity and duplicity of working in the industry that she is in and how she might have to safeguard and keep her personal life away from her work life. \n\nI mean, it doesn't sound like she ever told OP about any of this or even that she was still in the closet and hiding her relationship from her coworkers. So it's not weird or concerning that OP hasn't brought this up.\n\nThat said, it is a bit weird that they've never really talked about her work, at all. But everyone is different. I myself do my best to avoid talking about work to anybody, cause I don't like thinking about work when I'm not working. So I get it.", "Very wise", "> So my guess is she's in the closet or maybe has the so-called work wife. \n\nEh, I wouldn\u2019t jump to this conclusion based on the fact that they\u2019ve been together for 11 years and neither one of them has ever visited the other person\u2019s place of work. Sounds like they both keep business and personal strictly separated.", "She's a surgeon it seems, to be going into an emergency OR. I can't imagine her job not being secure in today's climate. She's already at the top, pretty much.", "I agree. Like wouldn\u2019t OP know about her wife\u2019s work schedule? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy for a doctor to have to stay 30 minutes late", "I wish this was true, but there's plenty of queerphobia and homophobia these days. There's an enormous difference between not wanting to be harassed and undermined at work for being gay/queer and being ashamed of your relationship.", "In her defence, most workplaces in healthcare are TOXIC. She may just be very private and closed off and keeps to herself to avoid being pulled into drama. But if that is the case, she should have a discussion with her partner and explain.", "Based on what? Her tone? That\u2019s not really reliable evidence of anything.

Homophobia is real.", "I totally missed it was 2 women. Still shouldn\u2019t be ashamed or worried. As a whole. I think most people are not homophobic. Those that are tend to be the loudest.
