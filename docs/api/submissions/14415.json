OP escalated it.  They are all assholes.", ">There is nothing in your description of what your sister said even remotely offensive\n\nI am not sure of that. She was jealous and was definitely being passive aggressive. I think it's an ESH situation where the parents are the biggest a**holes. \n\nAs someone whose parents have always drilled it into us that my sister and I are a team and need to always have each other's backs, this is sad. While we definitely were doing the cats n dogs fight thing while we were young, my sister and I are extremely close now.

Not morally, but practically it is a very unwise move.", "So the sister gets a pass for bullying and telling something that really wasn\u2019t any of her business, yeah I don\u2019t think so.

Therefore, I conclude that no one can absolutely know for certain who the instigator of the argument is. It's best not to assume information (and that applies to both parties involved, the OP's written statement can still be false).\n\nThank you and have a good day.", "It don't see how he was \"lording\" his position.

OP far less so, if even at all. I\u2019m still leaning NTA. \n\nI can absolutely understand him having zero respect for an older sibling who has continually targeted a sensitive topic of his, for what appears to be years.

His toxic glee is obvious. \n\n The truth is,this *whole* situation seems fucked. Mom and Dad are Bible Garotte caricatures,sister seems to be a clueless sheltered kid who learned some things the hard way and OP is a spiteful petty incel who uses his achievements to make others feel bad and himself feel good about it.

I\u2019ll bet money part of his treatment of his sister is a reflection of how their parents treated his sister when she got pregnant. I find it hypocritical for the parents to be mad at him when they likely encouraged the behavior.

To me, he clearly hates his sister and that makes his take on the situation questionable.", "Sorry, getting a train run on you is slang for many males one female group sex, as implied by OP in his counter punch at his sister. \n\n\nIn all seriousness, there are multiple reasons why she might not know who the father is, and no one in this story has tried to figure that out in the last 4+ years. OPs sister is an AH for needling him for never having a gf, and OP is an AH for lashing out an a disproportionate way, especially given the public setting.", "Jesus doesn't have a shred of envy or bitterness in his words or characterization. The only people he disliked were religious leaders using religion as a guise for their own schemes... hmmm... seems like a lot of people these days haven't read his actual teachings.", "He said that she has become known as the W word. While I loathe slutshaming idk if you should hold it against him that he relays what her reputation in the Bible Belt has become.

Meanwhile she's still taking every opportunity to piss on his social life and (lack of) relationships.

No need to be nice and pleasant with someone who's constantly putting you down.", "That's guesswork", "No, he said his parents called her a whore. He insulted her only after she took continued shots at him.", "I\u2019m not saying OP isn\u2019t an AH for what he said, but to be fair, he doesn\u2019t call his sister a whore - he\u2019s describing how she\u2019s perceived in his town and by his parents:\n\n> She broke our Alabama Bible Belt parents hearts and became known as the W word that got knocked up in college\n\nOf course, he does say something disgusting after his sister put him down\u2026 but I don\u2019t see any evidence that he\u2019s been initiating conflict through micro-digs, and I don\u2019t think we can just *assume* that he is the instigator\u2026 especially when his sister - having \u201cfallen from grace\u201d - would have just as much motivation to vent her frustration via attacks.", "He didn\u2019t call her one. He said she became known as one, which implies people in their hometown were saying this due to them living in the Alabama Bible Belt.", "He doesn't call her one. This is classic reddit nonsense.

What do you think the local town folks will call her?!", "I mean to me, it\u2019s pretty normal to be resentful towards a toxic family member that has treated you like shit for years. You\u2019re telling me that you wouldn\u2019t feel resentful towards someone, especially a family member, that has continually insulted you, put you down, and treated you horribly.", ">Didn't call her a whore,\n\nYes, he did.... coyly saying \"the w word\" doesn't take the meaning away.\n\nAgain, the level of bitterness in the OPs words leads me to think that he is more the instigator than the energy matcher.\nAlso, outright saying that his sister spent her time on her back with a queue out the door is in no way energy matching.", "I suppose he could've said her social life, unlike his, was extremely rich back in college. Does that sound like matching energy to you, then? \nYou're focusing on wording way too much, imho, while the issue is much deeper. \n\nHe did say he snapped after her constant mean girl throat jumps, so I figure people don't usually choose their words wisely when snapping at someone anyway. I for sure don't."]}
