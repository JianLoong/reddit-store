Last year, at my visit she told me they offer a new treatment \u201cRussian lip filler\u201d and told me a bit about it. I have naturally thick, plump lips but was super curious what they would look like with filler. We discussed it and I was persuaded so I got 0.5ml fillers. It was very painful and didn\u2019t make much difference. \n\nSo, I met B(M28) in Feb, we got on well but my mum was severely sick from March to Aug so we didn\u2019t really speak or hang out. We started talking again 2 months ago we\u2019re now dating. Not official-official but going well.\n\nWhen we met, B complimented my lips and asked if I had filler and I said \u201cno, all natural\u201d. This was about 8 months after my treatment, so the filler had faded at this point. Also this was our opening conversation, so I didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to share that I had had filler in the past. \n\n3 nights ago I get an email for my 6 month appointment and messaged my aesthetician to reschedule. B is beside me and asks what I\u2019m doing and I explain. He\u2019s asking about the cost and how often I get it done, then says that it\u2019s a waste of money. He\u2019s a financial advisor so I guess it\u2019s his job to say things like this but I ask him to mind his business in a light hearted way. He\u2019s still asking how many treatments I\u2019ve had done and how much it has cost me in total. I\u2019m annoyed but I scroll up to see what date I first message her and scroll past pictures of my lips swollen after having filler. He asks what they are and I explain I sent her a picture of my lips to ask if the swelling was normal. \n\nB gets angry and demands to know why I lied to him. I\u2019m confused and say I didn\u2019t lie about anything. He starts shouting that he specifically asked me if I had had filler and I straight up lied about it. I said I had only had filler once and it had been 8 months before I had even met him, the effects had already worn off and he didn\u2019t ask me if I had EVER had filler. He had asked if my lips looked like this because of filler, which they don\u2019t, because this is how they naturally look. He said it was a waste of money, I\u2019m wasting money I should be spending on my kids on filling my lips with toxic crap and then lying about it. I asked him not to comment on how I spend my money. \n\nHe was so offended and angry. He said he couldn\u2019t trust me cause if I\u2019d lie about something small, I\u2019d lie about something big just as easily. At this point I was stunned, didn\u2019t know how to handle a grown man shouting at me and wasn\u2019t even being heard cause he kept interrupting and huffing every time I spoke so I asked him to leave and he stormed out. \n\nI texted him the following morning and he didn\u2019t reply. It\u2019s been 2 days now and no contact I assume he\u2019s ended things. I\u2019ve never seen him even raise his voice and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it, I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m right or wrong.", "created_utc": 1698413138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hnilm/aita_for_lying_about_getting_lip_fillers/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's your money, your body and he shouldn't be sticking his nose into your business at this stage. Are you supposed to disclose all past beauty treatments? How about every color your hair has ever been, oh did you go up 5lbs in 2017?", ">When we met, B complimented my lips and asked if I had filler and I said \u201cno, all natural\u201d.\n\nThis would be a really dumb thing to ask in the first few dates.", "NTA.  He sounds controlling and like he has some damage he needs to work out.  \n\nAlso, your timeline is confusing with the mother getting sick and then you began talking again two months ago so I don't know how serious it was... \n\nBUT for me....unless you'd been together about 8 months and you were exclusive, I would say he is wildly overreacting if the relationship wasn't solidified.", "NTA. Not his fucking business plus a major red flag.", "Mm NTA. This was a miscommunication and maybe there would have been a way to clarify that you didn't have filler AT THE TIME you were talking  but honestly, that wasn't an appropriate question for him to ask you the first time you met so I understand why you gave the simplest answer of 'no', and his extreme reaction to your personal choices about your beauty regimen is out of line, offensive, controlling, and judgmental. Insisting on seeing your miscommunication as a lie rather than being willing to see what you'd meant at the time is really unhelpful and makes him TA here.", "NTA, he\u2019s wildly overreacting to a minor miscommunication. If he\u2019s unwilling to date someone who ever had a past cosmetic procedure, he needs to be a lot more specific in his questions when he meets people.  \n\nAlso, he may be a financial advisor but he\u2019s not YOUR financial advisor so no it isn\u2019t his job to tell you your personal spending is wasteful. In a committed relationship where you\u2019re thinking about sharing expenses or combining funds, you should discuss priorities and budgets for personal spending, though it shouldn\u2019t be in an accusatory or belittling way. But anyway you\u2019re not there and hopefully this was a breakup so you won\u2019t be there with him.", "NTA - He isn't allowed to speak to you that way. Nobody is allowed to speak with you that way. \n\nAnd if you care for someone, you don't speak to them the way he spoke with you. \n\nRUUUUNNNNNN!!!", "Dude he\u2019s fucking CRAZY and controlling. You need to dump him. Seriously stay away from him. NTA", "NTA. He has no right WHATSOEVER.", "Oh boy\u2026 dude sounds like a controlling piece of work. I\u2019d just bounce after this if I were in your place. NTA", "NTA and whether or not he feels he has ended things you should send him a message definitely ending your relationship. This guy is a jerk.", "Oh my dear, you dodged a bullet.  This man's reaction was controlling, intrusive, and hostile, showing a real problem with anger management and a belief that he has the right to comment on and control intimate aspects of your life.  You are so much better off without him.  Don't let him back.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He sounds like an asshole though. He should have heard you out before going off.", "NTA. 0,5 ml of filler dissolves way earlier than 8 months. Whatever lips you had when you met B, the filler had already been gone by that time. B sounds very controlling and disrespectful.It is not his call to decide which cosmetic procedures you should or should not go through. You are not obliged to report that to him. And making a scene about nonexistent lip filler is ridiculous and worrying. This is a red flag, consider breaking up, because it will only get worse if you continue dating.", "NTA, and good riddance to this man.", "ESH Your bf sounds extremely controlling, especially for such a short relationship. However, you weren\u2019t totally honest with him, so are also in the wrong. The honest thing would have been to say, \u201cI have naturally full lips, but once tried a temporary filler. It didn\u2019t do much and the effects have worn off, so my mouth looks the way it always has.\u201d You could even have shown him an old photo of yourself if he\u2019s that interested in your mouth.", "I am going with NTA, even tho you did lie to him a bit . However, his reaction (and other behavior mentioned) is a huge red flag and over the top. Block him and move on.", "YTA. You told a lie. He is not okay with it.  I can\u2019t say as I blame him because in his mind - \u201cdo you use lip filler?\u201d Is the same as \u201chave you used lip filler?\u201d  The fact that you did it 8 months prior is not a mitigating factor.  Scratch a lie find a thief. If he asked you if you cheated on him and you answered no because the other guys dick wasn\u2019t inside of you at the time he asked that would not be an acceptable answer either.  Trustworthiness is a far more attractive quality than full lips.", "YTA.  You did get lip fillers and though and you thought you could get away with lying about it because it was 8 months ago. You should ask yourself why you feel ashamed of admitting that you got lip fillers? You shouldn\u2019t hide who you are if you\u2019re trying to get to know someone, that\u2019s simple deception and you wouldn\u2019t want your date to do that to you, would you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We hung out from feb-march, kinda kept in touch but not as much between march-Aug. And now we\u2019ve been dating since sept, so nearly 2 months. I don\u2019t really count the first couple of months since we were just getting to know each other but the last 2 months have honestly been great. I\u2019m still so stunned at his reaction", "Thank you!!! Thanks for all of this. Yeah the financial comments annoy me, he thinks it\u2019s okay to say this because I\u2019m on benefits. He\u2019s made a few comments about how I spend my money and I always dismiss them. But it is controlling, you\u2019re right.", "Haha thank you. God help me, I\u2019ll hold my dignified silence to the end of my life", "She does not have to report to the dude every cosmetic procedure she ever had. Especially those which had no effect on her by the time they met.", "Yeah i guess that\u2019s true. Thank you \n\nI\u2019ve always had full lips and have always been complimented on them so I guess I was just accepting the compliment, and the fact that I had had filler before didn\u2019t seem important, since he was essentially complimenting my natural lips (at this point he had only seen photos of me and they were pre-filler). But maybe I should have just said that at the beginning. Thanks for the input", "I disagree. I think questions like \"Do you use...\" meaning \"Have you ever...\" are VERY subjective. \n\nIf you ask someone 'Do you smoke' you don't mean 'Have you ever at any time in your life smoked?' and especially for people who have just met it would be weird for her to err on the side of reporting her ENTIRE history relating to a question of a personal nature. \n\nIe 'Your lips are great - is that filler?' should not necessarily have caused OP to need to reply \"Well to be honest I did once use filler many months ago however I did not really like it and feel confident it has dissolved / faded away now SO thank you for the compliment and no, there is no filler in my lips currently but you should be advised that if you really are asking if I've EVER used filler I have to say yes I have.\"", "Well I have full, plump lips and I took his question to mean, is the reason you have full plump lips because you have filler? \n\nObviously the answer is no and that\u2019s not a lie. The filler faded after 4 months, maybe less. By the time I met him I had zero filler in my lips and in my mind I was answering honestly", "I\u2019m not ashamed! I talk about it all the time and was open about it when I had them done. \n\nBut they had dissolved months before I even met him. When he was complimenting my lips he was complimenting their natural size and shape.", "Yeah, I think you may be very lucky having this dude just ghost like that. Hope he stays out of your life. The first time you see someone act like that you know damn well it won't be the last. It usually escalates the more familiar they get, too, and our boy here was getting waaay too familiar too fast.", "If he doesn\u2019t agree with how you budget and spend money, that\u2019s a legit reason in itself for him to break up with you (or just keep it casual). But belittling you about it isn\u2019t useful or appropriate.", "No, you shouldn\u2019t have. It was an inappropriate question for a first time meeting to begin with. And you didn\u2019t need to explain anything to him, let alone everything the previous comment told you to say. And to suggest you pull out your phone and show a complete stranger pics to prove it?!? How ridiculous. \nConsider yourself lucky this dude ghosted you.", "Let\u2019s not forget that you met him not long ago and you don\u2019t owe him anything. Just live your life as you want it without other telling you what you can/cannot do with your own money/ body.", "I don\u2019t think you owe him a damn thing but lip fillers don\u2019t usually dissolve that quickly. Mine still weren\u2019t dissolved after 2 years. Also Russian lip filler is an enhancement to the shape, not just the volume. I\u2019m surprised with .5 cc you think it wasn\u2019t noticeable. \n\nBut again, it\u2019s none of his fucking business.", "There\u2019s no way you can possibly know if 100% of the injection has been absorbed or not, or if there were any residual particles left or any residual side effects.  The fact is that some people (most people) are extremely sensitive to facial alterations and it\u2019s really obvious because your natural facial proportions are off.  Also in relationships honesty is extremely important, so by not being 100% honest it\u2019s a very big turn off.", "Thank youuuu \ud83d\ude4f", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let him near me again after he raised his voice for no reason, but I get what you\u2019re saying", "Thank you! Yea I keep telling myself that too. The first doubt I ever had about him was he kept commenting about it being a waste of money and the comment about how the money should be going to my kids. It seemed out of character, I so shrugged it off but then everything that followed for the next hour was like several nails being hammered into the coffin simultaneously", "Honestly it hardly made any difference, so much pain for nothing \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBut thank you! Appreciate the input and low-key jealous your filler lasted 2 years", "But this still comes down to their respective interpretations. He didn't ask 'Have you at any time had filler' which would have been an inappropriate Q by the way. He asked if her full lips were the result of filler. Asking that does not obligate OP to deliver a full history - to someone she just met no less - of her prior experience with fillers!\n\nIf he was 'sensitive' to those things because her facial proportions were off as you put it, he could have decided he wasn't attracted to her. They had just met, she did not owe him TOTAL historical honesty and her saying she did not at the time have filler also was not blindsiding or misleading him.", "Yeah do not let him control you or your finances as you\u2019re a free woman to do as you please; even if you were married to him (let\u2019s say) you should still feel and be free to do whatever you want with your body. If he doesn\u2019t know how to digest your answer in your first date it\u2019s his problem. Be aware of the possible red flag there. Good luck!", "Sure this isn\u2019t a court case and they aren\u2019t under oath or anything, also cheating isn\u2019t illegal but it\u2019s typically frowned upon in monogamous relationships.  This is why I think she should have erred on the side of being more openly honest.  I personally would consider this being untruthful by omission, and a red flag.", "Expecting a total, historical account of something of such personal nature - once again from someone you've **just met** \\- to be off the walls as an expectation, completely overbearing and inappropriate. You really think you can ask a girl you just met to give a full rundown of a whole background on something like this, AND on top of that, judge her for not **offering** that information in response to a question like \"you have great lips, is that because of fillers?\" ? The entitlement and judgment is mind boggling.", "She could have declined to answer if she felt it was inappropriate, she chose to lie about it.  It\u2019s that simple.  Nobody\u2019s expecting any sort of total historical account of anything, not sure why you\u2019re straw-manning this lmao.  It was one question.", "Wrong. He asked DO YOU HAVE FILLERS and she said she did not which was accurate. \n\nHe meant to ask, or really intended to get the answer to a different question, one that he didn't ask probably because he knew it would be batshit to ask that in that setting. \n\nNow he - and you - want to judge her for answering the question he asked, and / or for not being a mind reader."]}
