Last year, at my visit she told me they offer a new treatment \u201cRussian lip filler\u201d and told me a bit about it. I have naturally thick, plump lips but was super curious what they would look like with filler. We discussed it and I was persuaded so I got 0.5ml fillers. It was very painful and didn\u2019t make much difference. \n\nSo, I met B(M28) in Feb, we got on well but my mum was severely sick from March to Aug so we didn\u2019t really speak or hang out. We started talking again 2 months ago we\u2019re now dating. Not official-official but going well.\n\nWhen we met, B complimented my lips and asked if I had filler and I said \u201cno, all natural\u201d. This was about 8 months after my treatment, so the filler had faded at this point. Also this was our opening conversation, so I didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to share that I had had filler in the past. \n\n3 nights ago I get an email for my 6 month appointment and messaged my aesthetician to reschedule. B is beside me and asks what I\u2019m doing and I explain. He\u2019s asking about the cost and how often I get it done, then says that it\u2019s a waste of money. He\u2019s a financial advisor so I guess it\u2019s his job to say things like this but I ask him to mind his business in a light hearted way. He\u2019s still asking how many treatments I\u2019ve had done and how much it has cost me in total. I\u2019m annoyed but I scroll up to see what date I first message her and scroll past pictures of my lips swollen after having filler. He asks what they are and I explain I sent her a picture of my lips to ask if the swelling was normal. \n\nB gets angry and demands to know why I lied to him. I\u2019m confused and say I didn\u2019t lie about anything. He starts shouting that he specifically asked me if I had had filler and I straight up lied about it. I said I had only had filler once and it had been 8 months before I had even met him, the effects had already worn off and he didn\u2019t ask me if I had EVER had filler. He had asked if my lips looked like this because of filler, which they don\u2019t, because this is how they naturally look. He said it was a waste of money, I\u2019m wasting money I should be spending on my kids on filling my lips with toxic crap and then lying about it. I asked him not to comment on how I spend my money. \n\nHe was so offended and angry. He said he couldn\u2019t trust me cause if I\u2019d lie about something small, I\u2019d lie about something big just as easily. At this point I was stunned, didn\u2019t know how to handle a grown man shouting at me and wasn\u2019t even being heard cause he kept interrupting and huffing every time I spoke so I asked him to leave and he stormed out. \n\nI texted him the following morning and he didn\u2019t reply. It\u2019s been 2 days now and no contact I assume he\u2019s ended things.

Not his fucking business plus a major red flag.", "Mm NTA. This was a miscommunication and maybe there would have been a way to clarify that you didn't have filler AT THE TIME you were talking  but honestly, that wasn't an appropriate question for him to ask you the first time you met so I understand why you gave the simplest answer of 'no', and his extreme reaction to your personal choices about your beauty regimen is out of line, offensive, controlling, and judgmental. Insisting on seeing your miscommunication as a lie rather than being willing to see what you'd meant at the time is really unhelpful and makes him TA here.", "NTA, he\u2019s wildly overreacting to a minor miscommunication. If he\u2019s unwilling to date someone who ever had a past cosmetic procedure, he needs to be a lot more specific in his questions when he meets people.  \n\nAlso, he may be a financial advisor but he\u2019s not YOUR financial advisor so no it isn\u2019t his job to tell you your personal spending is wasteful. In a committed relationship where you\u2019re thinking about sharing expenses or combining funds, you should discuss priorities and budgets for personal spending, though it shouldn\u2019t be in an accusatory or belittling way.

He should have heard you out before going off.", "NTA. 0,5 ml of filler dissolves way earlier than 8 months. Whatever lips you had when you met B, the filler had already been gone by that time. B sounds very controlling and disrespectful.It is not his call to decide which cosmetic procedures you should or should not go through. You are not obliged to report that to him. And making a scene about nonexistent lip filler is ridiculous and worrying. This is a red flag, consider breaking up, because it will only get worse if you continue dating.", "NTA, and good riddance to this man.", "ESH Your bf sounds extremely controlling, especially for such a short relationship. However, you weren\u2019t totally honest with him, so are also in the wrong. The honest thing would have been to say, \u201cI have naturally full lips, but once tried a temporary filler.

I can\u2019t say as I blame him because in his mind - \u201cdo you use lip filler?\u201d Is the same as \u201chave you used lip filler?\u201d  The fact that you did it 8 months prior is not a mitigating factor.  Scratch a lie find a thief. If he asked you if you cheated on him and you answered no because the other guys dick wasn\u2019t inside of you at the time he asked that would not be an acceptable answer either.  Trustworthiness is a far more attractive quality than full lips.", "YTA.  You did get lip fillers and though and you thought you could get away with lying about it because it was 8 months ago.

Especially those which had no effect on her by the time they met.", "Yeah i guess that\u2019s true. Thank you \n\nI\u2019ve always had full lips and have always been complimented on them so I guess I was just accepting the compliment, and the fact that I had had filler before didn\u2019t seem important, since he was essentially complimenting my natural lips (at this point he had only seen photos of me and they were pre-filler). But maybe I should have just said that at the beginning. Thanks for the input", "I disagree. I think questions like \"Do you use...\" meaning \"Have you ever...\" are VERY subjective. \n\nIf you ask someone 'Do you smoke' you don't mean 'Have you ever at any time in your life smoked?' and especially for people who have just met it would be weird for her to err on the side of reporting her ENTIRE history relating to a question of a personal nature. \n\nIe 'Your lips are great - is that filler?' should not necessarily have caused OP to need to reply \"Well to be honest I did once use filler many months ago however I did not really like it and feel confident it has dissolved / faded away now SO thank you for the compliment and no, there is no filler in my lips currently but you should be advised that if you really are asking if I've EVER used filler I have to say yes I have.\"", "Well I have full, plump lips and I took his question to mean, is the reason you have full plump lips because you have filler? \n\nObviously the answer is no and that\u2019s not a lie. The filler faded after 4 months, maybe less. By the time I met him I had zero filler in my lips and in my mind I was answering honestly", "I\u2019m not ashamed! I talk about it all the time and was open about it when I had them done. \n\nBut they had dissolved months before I even met him.

The first time you see someone act like that you know damn well it won't be the last. It usually escalates the more familiar they get, too, and our boy here was getting waaay too familiar.", "If he doesn\u2019t agree with how you budget and spend money, that\u2019s a legit reason in itself for him to break up with you (or just keep it casual).

How ridiculous. \nConsider yourself lucky this dude ghosted you.", "Let\u2019s not forget that you met him not long ago and you don\u2019t owe him anything.

The fact is that some people (most people) are extremely sensitive to facial alterations and it\u2019s really obvious because your natural facial proportions are off.  Also in relationships honesty is extremely important, so by not being 100% honest it\u2019s a very big turn off.", "Thank youuuu \ud83d\ude4f", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let him near me again after he raised his voice for no reason, but I get what you\u2019re saying", "Thank you! Yea I keep telling myself that too. The first doubt I ever had about him was he kept commenting about it being a waste of money and the comment about how the money should be going to my kids. It seemed out of character, I so shrugged it off but then everything that followed for the next hour was like several nails being hammered into the coffin simultaneously", "Honestly it hardly made any difference, so much pain for nothing \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBut thank you! Appreciate the input and low-key jealous your filler lasted 2 years", "But this still comes down to their respective interpretations. He didn't ask 'Have you at any time had filler' which would have been an inappropriate Q by the way. He asked if her full lips were the result of filler. Asking that does not obligate OP to deliver a full history - to someone she just met no less - of her prior experience with fillers!\n\nIf he was 'sensitive' to those things because her facial proportions were off as you put it, he could have decided he wasn't attracted to her. They had just met, she did not owe him TOTAL historical honesty and her saying she did not at the time have filler also was not blindsiding or misleading him.", "Yeah do not let him control you or your finances as you\u2019re a free woman to do as you please; even if you were married to him (let\u2019s say) you should still feel and be free to do whatever you want with your body.

I personally would consider this being untruthful by omission, and a red flag.", "Expecting a total, historical account of something of such personal nature - once again from someone you've **just met** \\- to be off the walls as an expectation, completely overbearing and inappropriate. You really think you can ask a girl you just met to give a full rundown of a whole background on something like this, AND on top of that, judge her for not **offering** that information in response to a question like \"you have great lips, is that because of fillers?\" ? The entitlement and judgment is mind boggling.", "She could have declined to answer if she felt it was inappropriate, she chose to lie about it.  It\u2019s that simple.

He asked DO YOU HAVE FILLERS and she said she did not which was accurate. \n\nHe meant to ask, or really intended to get the answer to a different question, one that he didn't ask probably because he knew it would be batshit to ask that in that setting. \n\nNow he - and you - want to judge her for answering the question he asked, and / or for not being a mind reader.", "NTA. You sure it's not Italian lip filler? Cuz you've got marinara flags all over here.\n\nYour boyfriend shouldn't be telling you how to spend your own money - and you were correct in lightly telling him to mind his own business.\n\nThen he claimed you were lying, when you clearly were not - you interpreted that whole thing correctly, you said your lips were natural **when he asked** \\- maybe he doesn't understand that lip filler is a temporary procedure, not like breast implants? But you tried to tell him that and he was just yelling at you.\n\nI'm sorry this relationship turned out this way, but I think you dodged a bullet here by learning about his controlling tendencies and temper now rather than later.", "NTA\nHe is probably the type of guy who only likes \u201cnatural women\u201d but his socials are full of women in bikinis that have had lots of procedures and full face makeup in a nude color palette. \n\n(Also nothing wrong with people that express themselves with cosmetic procedures and makeup  in case anyone thinks I\u2019m being a jerk about it.)", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s definitely got some issues with women who get plastic surgery/fillers. I\u2019m surprised you even responded to his initial remarks about your lips because it\u2019s just such a rude comment. I guess he\u2019s mad you\u2019re not the all natural beauty he thought you were and he\u2019s too oblivious to realize that lots of people get things like filler and it\u2019s oftentimes not noticeable.\n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. It probably would have been better to tell him you had gotten filler in the past, simply because you would not have wasted your time dating him, but I think you answered the question honestly.\n\nIn the future, it might be better not to date men who have hangups about surgery/fillers, which I think his initial remark about your lips hinted at. It seems like you put a lot of effort into maintaining your physical appearance and a guy who\u2019s going to be judgmental of that is not going to be a good fit for you.", "Edit: ESH. So while his tone seems wholly inappropriate, don't you think he may have had a point? Getting lip filler and beauty treatments while you get government assistance and have 4 children *does* seem financially irresponsible, especially to someone who works in that field. Since you also do freelance work on the side, I'm not sure what your reasons for not working are but I also don't feel like it's my place to ask.

I don't see how benefits could cover their expenses and luxuries like cosmetic treatments but hopefully it works for you. \n\nINFO: in the comments you said you're on benefits. What does that mean? And how does that factor in to cosmetic treatments? And do you have kids? He said you could be spending the money on your kids but you didn't mention having any in the post.", "NTA and this guy is not someone you need in your life.

Only spend what's exactly necessary or save. Even people on limited income deserve a little fun money of their choosing.\n\nAnd sure, I wouldn't necessarily spend that on lip filler, but when I have all my bills paid, including my groceries, my expensive physical therapy and anything left over can be put aside to save and to use for myself, I'm going to use some of that for myself.\n\nI've seen the same kind of criticism thrown at people who've cut out a lot of things in the cost of living crisis, who don't surrender literally every single pleasant thing in their lives while trying to save.
