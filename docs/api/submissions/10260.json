It's not your fault they decided to walk up to some strangers door trying to sell cookies. You being in a robe was the least of their problems doing that because what if they happened to walk right into a serial killer?

One night after dark, there was a knock on the door, so she and her dog (a big boxer) went and opened the door. The boxer went crazy with barking and lunging. The man\u2019s eyes get really big and he said \u201cit\u2019s okay lady, if you can back up I\u2019ll close the door.\u201d  She then looked out the pep hole, and saw 2 men were runners from the house. \n\nIf you have a closet by your door, keep a quick change of clothes in there. You may never need it. But stay safe.", "NTA\nBut I thought the GS discouraged members doing door-to-door sales a few years back? (Maybe it was just my state or area, idk.)
