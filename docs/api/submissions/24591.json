She could have come to you to get the key. She has legs, they work.", "NTA", "Info: how old is your stepsister?", "YTA, get over yourself, mate. Your probably weak as hell at the gym to lolol.", "NTA. Since she forgets her key 3 or 4 times a week - it's unreasonable to expect you to drop all your social life this often. I'd drop all my plans if my family member forgets her key once in 2 or 3 years, but since it's a habit, she has to just wait.", "NTA", "I was going to say no.   But YTA.   If you had just gone to lunch and THEN went home that's one thing, as she cannot expect people to drop everything they are doing because she yet again forgot her key.   It's not like it's a rare occurrence.    But to make her wait 3 hours, that was way overboard and a complete asshole thing to do.

You for being an AH about it.", "NTA it's not your responsibility to be home to let her in, that's why she has a key. It sucks she had to wait, but that's why it's important to keep track of your keys. Unless there were some weather conditions that would made it extra shitty or dangerous or you live in a bad neighborhoods or something I think you're fine.", "NTA - she should remember her key or contact her sister and not just rely on you, what would happen if you were injured at football practice and needed to go to the emergency room.  Also, you mentioned you had to take the train home, was she willing to pay for the extra train trips so you could go back and meet up with your friends?", "NTA - you cant base your schedule around her just because she cant be bothered to remember her key. it was a good lessen and its not that big a deal if she's just waiting in your homes backyard.", "NTA she\u2019s the one who forgot her keys and that\u2019s her problem, you don\u2019t have to stop whatever you\u2019re doing just to open the door for her and she should learn her lesson.", "INFO: how old is she? Are we dealing with 12, 20?", "NTA. She needs to be more responsible, and you shouldnt need to rush home or anything like that. Shes lucky you keep coming to let her in.

Just read the title out loud to yourself.", "ESH - your step sister needs to get her shit together because forgetting your keys that much is ridiculous. \n\nYou however, are not responsible for that. If you had plans or were busy thats totally fine. What made you an AH was purposely waiting and staying out to spite her. Even if something else came up and you were going to be longer, no issue. But you did do this on purpose.", "Nta, it is not your fault your family put the responsibility on you to let her in.

You literally kept her out extra hours for no reason but spite. It\u2019s not horrible not to have rushed home, as long as she was waiting in a safe place, but why make her suffer extra?

She needs to learn responsibility. Even us older adults have this happen at times (not so many times a week but) & even we understand not to just expect someone to drop everything to fix our faults. \nYes ok it was a touch mean to stay out even longer after the fact of lunch knowing but same time, you also were already out with them in first place. \nMaybe store keys outside only the family know so she can get in", "NTA for not rushing home, but dragging your heals afterwards was a dick move. \n\nBeing locked out is totally on her. See if your dad can get a keypad lock for the back door so she can get in with a code.", "NTA, if your step sister is old enough to going out and about alone, then she's old enough to be responsible for her keys. She and your dad can't expect other people to drop what they're doing and let her in.

Especially because this was the first time she would've realised how important it is for her to have her key.", "NTA. I used to forget my key sometimes, and I'd have to chill until someone got home. There was no calling someone to come home early. It was just sitting in the backyard and relaxing.", "NTA. She should quit depending on you and just remember to take a key. How hard is it to keep one in her purse or book bag.", "NTA.  She needs to be made responsible for her own problems with not taking a key.  Forgetting your key 3-4 times per week isn't a mistake, sounds like its her being irresponsible, and you are her step brother, not her parent.  The parents need to step in here, and do something about it, and that is not making you responsible for her.  Hopefully she learnt her lesson.", "I used to be horrible about forgetting my house key & my roommates at the time would have to constantly let me in. One night, I got home late, & my roommates were out of town & the other was at a bar. I called the one at the bar but she didn\u2019t want to leave. I didn\u2019t blame her, but I was completely stuck, & felt like I was going to die after being outside for at least 2 hours in shorts, in 12\u00b0 weather. I went to a neighbors house who thankfully let me in to warm up, charge my phone, & call someone else to stay at their house until my roommate got home. I would never have dreamed to blame my roommate for her not leaving the bar early because I was irresponsible with my keys. I haven\u2019t forgotten my keys since that brutal lesson was learned.. hopefully it\u2019ll do the same for your sister.", "NTA. Might I recommend advising your parents that a code entry deadbolt may help her issue of remembering her keys?", "As a parent, I would tell them they need to remember the key. \n\nEverything is a life lesson at this age. She needs to learn to take care of herself.  This is the time to make these mistakes. She has a safe place to make these mistakes. \n\nIt was a little petty. And if she had called her sister then maybe she would have been able to get inside earlier. \n\nParents gave her a key and it is her responsibility to remember to bring the key when she leaves. Backpacks usually have a spot to clip the key ring in.", "NTA - if she legit forgets her key 3-4 times a week she needs a swift kick in the reminder area of her brain and you gave it to her.", "NTA\n\nShe has a set of keys and decides to not bring them with her, why is that your problem. You don't forget them 3-4 times a week, you elect not to bring them 3-4 times a week.", "NTA. She is relying on you to have a key. Forgetting 3-4 times a week is ridiculous. Next time she calls just let it go to voicemail and when just before you get home switch your phone off.\n\nAlso, parents should help and hide a spare key in the backyard or something. They can also put a spare key somewhere she isn't likely to forget like attached to her phone.\n\nUltimately it's your stepsisters responsibility to bring the key if she wants to get into the house.", "ESH Your stepsister needs to be more mindful and check she has the house key before she leaves home.

If it was that urgent, she would have remembered her own key. Or she could have come and met you for your key if she felt like it.

Im surprised the other sister is mad at OP, considering I don't see her offering to come home and unlock the door. Maybe it is her turn to help the sister from now on.

I would love to kick it with you guys, but I can't stay longer because my sister forgot her keys as usual and I would, apparently, be an asshole if my life didn't revolve around my sister.

Why is it op responsible?", "The dad is just essentially making OP responsible for fixing the stepsister's repeated mistake. I'd like the dad if he said OK, we're getting a lock with a code or something like that which would actually fix the problem instead of just giving OP a job and allowing the sister to continue to be irresponsible.", "Which justifies OP being a jerk on purpose why?", "Hindsight being 20/20 you should've told them once it became habitual", "15 is old enough to be responsible for taking a key. Hopefully she learned some type of lesson about making sure she has it. When I forgot my keys at that age I had to wait a few hours outside for family to get home from work/school, nobody was going to rush home to let me in. A wise man once said; if you're gonna be dumb you gotta be tough.", "Im assuming she does not have any major issues then?\n\nIf you can remember your key so can she. \n\nNTA\n\nSide note: maybe your parents can invest on a digital lock, to prevent this from happening again.", "He could stay out as long as he wants - but doing it solely out of spite is what makes him an AH.", "Nobody is going home to let her in. He lets her in as he walks in himself. If she had a key, would he shut and lock the door anyway, so she had to let herself in separately?", "Yes, she hasn\u2019t learned. That doesn\u2019t mean her family hasn\u2019t been mean enough to her yet.\n\nHe didn\u2019t simply not rush home\u2014he stayed away extra time on purpose.
