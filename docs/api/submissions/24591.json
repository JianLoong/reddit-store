Next time she calls just let it go to voicemail and when just before you get home switch your phone off.\n\nAlso, parents can help and hide a spare key in the backyard or something.

She needs to learn to be responsible, and you will no longer be changing your plans because your stepsister can't be bothered to take her key.  And having to wait for a while in the backyard might just be the lesson that helps her remember her damn key.", "NTA. Have your dad install a lockbox outside with a combo that contains a spare key. They make small ones for this exact purpose. That way, your stepsister never needs to remember her key--she just opens the box, uses the key, and replaces it in the box. No need for anyone to be inconvenienced.", "NTA and who cares if you stayed late? Maybe now she will learn. She was in your backyard, it\u2019s not like she was stranded somewhere scary.

You can not expect to inconvenience people on a daily basis, nor can you expect to always have someone available to come let you in. You have to learn not to forget your keys. I have no idea how I learned to make sure I have them, but it is the 1 thing I've learned to never leave the house without. At least 99% of the time. NTA. Some people need to learn the hard way.

You go home.  \n\nI also said he should have lunch.   He had plans.", "Doesn't matter. He was in a position to help her, and he chose not to. If he ever needs help and she tells him to go fuck himself, it serves him right. The fact he was milking the time for no other reason than to irritate her is what makes his behavior childish. Yes, her forgetting her key so often needs to be addressed. But this isn't addressing that. All it does is build resentment.", "\n\nWhich is why I said the parents should invest in a keypad.    I also said he should totally have gone to lunch since she does this on the regular, there is no need to rush home.  She has to learn.   BUT to not go home when he was done and just stay out knowing she's sitting waiting is just as bad as her forgetting her key 3-4 times a week.  He stayed out and extra 2 hours just to upset her.   Had he gone home AFTER lunch then I would agree n.t.a.  but he didn't, he stayed.  So I stand by my original response.  \n\nBut I also say his parents and sisters are too.
