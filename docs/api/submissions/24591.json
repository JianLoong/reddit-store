And having to wait for a while in the backyard might just be the lesson that helps her remember her damn key.", "NTA. Have your dad install a lockbox outside with a combo that contains a spare key. They make small ones for this exact purpose. That way, your stepsister never needs to remember her key--she just opens the box, uses the key, and replaces it in the box. No need for anyone to be inconvenienced.", "NTA and who cares if you stayed late? Maybe now she will learn. She was in your backyard, it\u2019s not like she was stranded somewhere scary.

You can not expect to inconvenience people on a daily basis, nor can you expect to always have someone available to come let you in. You have to learn not to forget your keys. I have no idea how I learned to make sure I have them, but it is the 1 thing I've learned to never leave the house without. At least 99% of the time. NTA. Some people need to learn the hard way.
