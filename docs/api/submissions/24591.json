And having to wait for a while in the backyard might just be the lesson that helps her remember her damn key.", "NTA. Have your dad install a lockbox outside with a combo that contains a spare key.

No need for anyone to be inconvenienced.", "NTA and who cares if you stayed late? Maybe now she will learn. She was in your backyard, it\u2019s not like she was stranded somewhere scary.

Imagine she forgets her key that often when she lives alone, one day. I don't understand why your father doesn't see the problem with her forgetting the key over and over again. Of course it's not a big issue right now but it's best for her to lern it before it's becoming a problem. Also you shouldn't have to suffer because she keeps forgetting the key. You should be allowed to stay with your friends after practice.", "You could\u2019ve milked it for 25 hours and you still wouldn\u2019t have been the asshole.

Parents need to figure out a way to deal with this without you paying for her mistakes", "NTA\n\nShe has no trouble remembering her phone, right? I'm sure there exists some kind of phone case that can have a key tucked into it.  Even if there isn't - if she can remember her phone, she can remember her keys.

As a mom of 3 boys, 1 who lost his house key regularly...I got a digital lock.  Might suggest that to the folks, that way if she \"forgets\" her key she can still get in and not inconvenience anyone else.", "Make her wait until you finish lunch, fine. I think the extra 2 hours makes you the AH.", "C'mon people, yes YTA for hanging out for an extra \"hour or two\" (by which you clearly mean 2hours) when you _know_ someone is waiting to be let in.\n\nNo, you don't have to drop everything immediately, but to _intentionally_ drag it out is _obviously_ AH behavior.\n\n3-4 times a WK, is more or less every day, so while I find this slightly hard to believe, if this truly is the case then you need to bring it up with your family to find a solution that doesn't require you to always be available to let your sister in; but deciding to leave them stranded for an additional 2hours is definitely not the right (sane / mature) way to make this point if you want to be respected by your family.", "Yeah, the part where you intentionally didn't go to let her in even though you hadn't made plans prior to that day to keep hanging out makes you an AH. If you had just gone to lunch like you planned and went straight home to let her in you wouldn't be, but you stayed out longer for no reason than to milk some extra time? YTA", "NTA for having lunch but an AH for extending unnecessarily.", "YTA because you Lied to her instead of just telling her that you will not make in time since you are budy.

Just making her wait until after lunch was enough, the extra hours was overkill.", "I\u2019m gonna have to swing the other way and say you\u2019re TA.\nYou imply that you deliberately extended the time BECAUSE she was locked out. That\u2019s kinda assholish. You definitely should NOT have dropped what you were doing to run to her aid, but to deliberately make the wait time longer is a jerk thing to do. I was on your side 100% until that.", "She should have remembered her keys, but you're definitely TA for milking the time after lunch.

Install keypad lock. \n\nHonestly makes me wonder if this story is true.", "It's... still less work for her to drive home than for you to get public transport, though. More gas, sure, but less work, and less time. There is no world in which it is fair to expect you to drop your social life literally half of all days because your stepsister apparently can't remember the simplest things. Like I see someone else pointing out: Start telling your stepsister that if she needs a key so badly, she can get it on your terms. She can come to wherever you are and pick it up... or she can start bringing her own from home in the first place, like anyone with even a shred of responsibility would do. Not sure how old your stepsister is, but I've been doing it every single day since I was eight or so. I'm sure she can handle it.\n\nGranted, it was a bit of an AH move to give her a vague timeframe (\"I'm having lunch and I'll be home after\"), and then change those plans entirely; if she knew you were going to take three hours rather than one, she might've wanted to find some other solution. Once you've made a schedule - a promise - you should stick to it, since it's affecting someone other than yourself.

Why did she stay in the garden for 3 hours instead of coming to collect the key from you?", "It will never happen as long as the parents keep up the enabling", "Tell them how often this happens. Wtf does your Dad expect you to do if you got a job and couldn't come home to let her in?", "Or they could just \"forget\" their keys, have the keys on them but said they forgot in situations when the ss does actually forget. As well as have a book or something to pass time. See how that works for dad and older sister", "Some lessons haven't been so easily learned, but that one...\n\nBeing stuck outside on my own while the sky turned dark in freezing temperatures was a very good motivator for not making the same mistake again.

Not on a school day, but when I was being taken on a shopping trip by a friend of my parents. That one was funnier because I wasn't alone or in danger, and had an adult in the same boat with me. We got back home to find that my parents had gone out to run an errand; thankfully when we went into the back garden to wait, we found that my parents had accidentally left the kitchen window open, so my very responsible adult shared a giggle with me about becoming a burglar and then gave me a boost into the window, so I could climb over the sink and go open the front door for her.)", "Lol.

Her own sister would tell her no. \n\n>She forgets her house key like maybe 3 or 4 times a week\n\nHas this been communicated to your dad and her mom? She needs consequences.

I don't think you should have cancelled your plans, but staying out just to spite her is mean.", "NTA, but also YTA. You know why, you about said as much. You were not wrong for making her wait. It\u2019s bullshit she keeps forgetting her keys, and she should have to live with the consequences. You shouldn\u2019t have milked the time though. That was petty and beneath you. That makes you a jerk, and has invalidated your argument in the eyes of your family.", "You took upon yourself to teach her a good lesson, and that always have a bit of sorf AH-lery to it. Unfortunately, she sould be able to count on her older sister and her parents for help, not just yours. The only thing thant I find is missing for a clear judgement is the age of the sisters and you. Like, if the younger stepsister is 9 or 10, it is much mor an AH move than if she is 14 or 16. So ESH, parents souldn't put it all on you : if the younger kid forgets her key so often they need to find a way to help her directly, not use you as a crutch and bug you social life.", "Gonna go against the train here, YTA. \n\nYes, it is annoying for you that your sister is forgetful. Yes, it is annoying for you that she called and tried to convince you to come let her in. And yes, it is perfectly understandable that you stayed and finished your lunch with your friends.\n\nWhat makes YTA is that you intentionally made a person's situation worse for no reason. All these people freaking about how she should just fix that, have obviously never experienced ADD or any other attention disorders. I'm an EXTREMELY forgetful person. It's really stupid some of the things I forget, important major things. I'd be more understanding if there was some reason, but I'll honestly forget things just sitting around. This includes remembering to pack things I don't keep packed.\n\nSo to be clear, I do think you should've finished your lunch and enjoyed that time with your friends. I also believe that once lunch was over, you should've just gone home instead of intentionally making her wait twice as long. Do you honestly believe that's going to help her remember anything? Of course you don't, you just wanted to be mean cause this situation was annoying you.  Maybe instead of just being mean about it, you could make some suggestions for how she can help herself avoid that, simultaneously helping YOU avoid THAT.\n\nThe only thing that worked for me for house keys, was literally never letting them leave my purse if it wasn't to open the door.
