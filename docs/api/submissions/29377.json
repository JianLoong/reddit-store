We often go to one another when we have problems and have just constantly been each other's closest friend since we met. \n\nAbout a couple of months ago, he started dating this girl from one of his classes and ever since then we haven't talked or seen much of each other. I didn't really mind since I figured they needed the time to bond and get to know each other better.\n\nWell a week and a half ago, I had my birthday and he completely forgot about it. He sent me a text around lunch time asking  if we could meet up on campus and I agreed. When we met up at the library I thought he was going to greet me a happy birthday but ended up asking me if I could help him finish his girlfriend's report for her corporate finance class (I'm not in finance but I'm quite good at making presentations and have a good visual eye when it comes to editing). I was surprised since I've never even met his girlfriend but he said he'd pay me for it and would get me coffee if I did it so I agreed.\n\nAfter finishing the presentation, he leaves me in the library and says he had to go and that we would talk later. He talks to me casually throughout the day but I wasn't really replying much since I was kinda bummed out and I had to get ready to drive home since my parents were taking me out to dinner. \n\nWhen we got seated at the restaurant I told him I might not reply until later because I was having dinner with my parents. I told him it was my birthday dinner with them. He ignored it and went on to talk about a different topic. \n\nDays after that we never talked about him forgetting my birthday but I just brushed it off because I thought I was being overdramatic. His birthday was today and I didn't get him anything. But I did wish him a happy birthday. He asked me what I got him as a gift and I told him I didn't buy him anything but wish him a great day. Now he's being snappy at me and said he was disappointed because I had asked him what he wanted as a present 3 months back. I kind of think I was being overdramatic and pettt and should have just gotten him a gift.\n\nMy other friends said I didn't do anything wrong since he forgot my birthday and stopped hanging out with me anyway ever since he got with his girlfriend. AND ALSO he hasn't paid me for finishing the presentation for him nor has he gotten me coffee. LOL.

Tell him you were hurt that he totally blew off your birthday and didn\u2019t really feel like getting him a gift since he doesn\u2019t seem to have any time for you except to ask you for favors. I get you guys are only 20 and are still learning about these things but in life effective communication will take you very far \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA but he sounds like he\u2019s using you and is not a real friend. I recommend having a conversation about him forgetting your birthday and how it made you feel. Also mention that you\u2019re disappointed he still hasn\u2019t paid you or gotten you coffee. If after this things don\u2019t change that would be a sign the friendship has run it\u2019s course", "I'd be reminding him how dismissive he was of your birthday and how he didn't give it a second thought.   He sounds like one of those fairweather friends who will be right back to being your friend again the second he splits with his girlfriend.\n\nPersonally, I'd be dialling down the effort put into this 'friendship' if he's going to be like that.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  NTA.", "NTA- he didn't forget, he ignored it. He's not your friend anymore", "NTA\n\nTell him that he sucks as a friend for not even wishing you a gappy birthday on your birthday, just getting you to do his girlfriend's presentation, bit then getting pissy you didn't get him a gift.\n\nDid he ever pay you for the work you did for him or get you that coffee he promised?", "NTA\n\nI am so offended on your behalf. Please tell him he didn\u2019t even greet you on your birthday even after you told him you were having your birthday dinner. Stop letting this mofo take advantage of your kindness. The fact that he is going out of his way to help his gf, to the point of asking you to help him help her, but he can\u2019t even be bothered to greet you?!?!!! And then he acts all entitled as if you owe him a gift?! Wowwww.", "NTA but please drop him as a friend. Just ghost him. You don\u2019t have to make this grand departure.\n\nHe\u2019s TA. Cut your losses and peace out.", "NTA\n\nBut use your words!", "NTA ask him where YOUR gift was and that at least you YOU remembered his birthday.", "NTA\n\nMaybe explain him your point of view. And ask him about his. Why does he expect a gift if he doesn\u2019t make any? Why did he not give the money he owes you? Why he doesn\u2019t think your birthday is important? Etc. If you understand why he thinks what he thinks you won\u2019t get mad at him. Maybe you won\u2019t feel like it makes you happy being around him but who knows. You may decide to try making him a better person but you may decide to let him be the person he wants to be. You may also just warn him, as a friend, that he might hurt the people he care about eventually.", "Well, NTA, but frankly you messed up by simply writing off your own feelings as you being \"overdramatic\" - if someone hurts your feelings, tell them.\n\nI almost said NAH but his behavior is pretty oblivious and self-centered if he can't make the connections here.", "NTA. He\u2019s using you but it\u2019s a cannon event", "he\u2019s not much of a friend, it sounds like. more of a user. nta.", "NTA\n\nHe invested 0 in your friendship since he met his gf, didn't remember your birthday and didn't congratulate you when you reminded him, he hasn't paid you for work you did on the gf's presentation, and now expects a birthday gift? Lol, no!", "He forgot your birthday, and didn\u2019t get you a present.  That\u2019s not great, nor is it a big deal.  So far he\u2019s doing okay.\n\nYou remembered his birthday, and chose not to get him something when it is has been customary in the past to do so.   Little bit of AH energy here.\n\nAnd then he complained about you not getting him a gift for his.  Total AH move.\n\nSeems like ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Granted this statement is only based on your post so I could be wrong.", "NTA \n\nYou matched his energy, end of. Stop being \u201cfriends\u201d with this dude. He isn\u2019t your friend at all.", "NTA . You should reconsider how this friendship benefits you both since it seems like he doesn\u2019t seem to value your friendship as much. Coming from someone who who spends more time w my partner rather than friends, I still try to make my close friends feel special on THEIR day. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that from someone you care about. Maybe it\u2019s time to sit down with him and talk about your concerns within your guys\u2019 friendship.", "NTA but I'm willing to bet that he's thinking \"well, I have a girlfriend now, so it's not okay for me to acknowledge *her* birthday, but she has no legitimate reason to do the same to me!\" Which is shitty btw.\n\nThe *only* thing you're kind of TA on here is doing someone's work for them. She can do it herself. And don't let him treat you this way, friends don't do that.", "NTA\n\nYour friend, however, sounds like an AH that you' be better off without. I'd tell him that since your birthday passed without any acknowledgement, that you figured you weren't doing presents this year. And that he still owes you money.", "I would also tell him that you are not risking your academic career to cheat on schoolwork for this girlfriend (who didn't even ask herself?) and that moving forward everybody needs to do their own work.", "Can\u2019t be bothered to tell OP happy birthday or even acknowledge her, but wants her to help this girl she\u2019s never met cheat on her assignments. Great morals, dude.  \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t have bothered wishing him happy birthday. It feels petty, but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. At work, emails get sent around for everyone\u2019s birthday. \u201cWe have a birthday today in (department).\u201d Everyone else on the team has a string of \u201chappy birthday\u201d messages, but for whatever reason, on my birthday...nothing. Next birthday in the team, I just opted out from the birthday wishes. It hurts when people you think you\u2019re close to just...ignore you.", "I had a \u201cfriend\u201d like this. Regular meet-ups until she starting dating this guy. The next time we went out after she started going out with him (it was a weekend trip) she talked non-stop about how he had a car. I don\u2019t even know. Great, he can drive you places? Yay?  \n\nThe friendship eventually ended when she told me \u201cwe have nothing in common, we\u2019ve never really been friends anyway\u201d (news to me) and *then* berated me for unfriending her on Facebook. It took years but I finally realised she only kept me around for when she didn\u2019t have any better offers. She was also a massive liar - always saying what she thought I wanted to hear, even if she then contradicted herself later. The only regret was not cutting out on her sooner, all the clues were there, I just wanted to think the best of her. I see similarities in this guy OP describes.", "HOW IN THE WORLD IS THIS AN E... S... H SITUATION? \n\nYou are NEVER obligated to get anyone a gift for their birthday, and she didn't expect him to get her a gift just acknowledge the day. She still wished him a happy birthday, and acknowledged his day. He's the AH because he's entitled, well wishes isn't enough he's expects a present. meanwhile he still hasn't bothered to even wish OP a Happy Belated Birthday.\n\n He still hasn't even acknowledged OPs birthday, he forfeits any reasonable expectation of a gift. That's not an AH move that's just matching energy.  He changed the parameters/expectations of the relationship when he didn't get OP a gift even after her birthday passed. If it's tradition to get gifts and he still didn't get one for OP, she's correct to assume that it's a tradition that has ended, unless the friend is creating a new tradition where OP gets him a gift and he gifts OP extra homework.\n\nHe gets a slight pass for initially forgetting the birthday, shit happens, I've been so busy with work that while in my head I might be aware of someone's birthday, know the date, I'll be so all over the place I won't make the connection... the difference is once I remember I correct the mistake. Once I realized I forgot, I'm calling, texting emailing, a belated birthday acknowledgement. and depending on how close we are running to store/online to buy a last minute/late gift. Once he was told it was her birthday that was his moment to correct the error, but he didn't bother. \n\nHe forgot OPs birthday but didn't manage to forget that she has skills he can use to help him out. It's easy to get caught up in a new relationship, but allowing that to take over where you ignore your friends is not ok. The way he's treating/using OP, he's not treating her as a friend at all. He becomes a full AH when he gets snappy and cold to her over a gift, meanwhile OP has not been snappy with him despite the fact that he still hasn't wished her a Happy Birthday, still hasn't apologized for forgetting, and is existing as though her birthday never even happened. \n\nI'm glad OP has other friends, start building those bond more because this friendship may have run its course. We don't put friends on shelves to pick up and use when ever we remember they're there and need them, it's not fair to OP that if/when his relationship ends suddenly he was to be BFFs again. NTA"]}
