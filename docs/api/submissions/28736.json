We managed to get out unit and moved when my girl turned 1 month . \n\nI couldn't stand doing my confinment there . I was breakdown to no end due to the constant pressure.  Now it so much better but I really dislike the way she talk to my girl and I know my girl.hates it cos the moment she says she naughty or smt my girl acts out immediately.", "This is called victim blaming. What are you dong to bring about your own abuse and it's wrong.   I hope to heck my kids marry into families that are kind to them if they choose to marry, but if not - I won't ever gaslight into thinking it's their fault.", "You really need block mil and everyone else who thinks they are allowed to abuse and berate you. \n\nYou need to up and move away and go no co tact will mil and all of them. \n\nStop talking to her and stop letting her visit with you and baby. \n\nShe is abusing you all and it's going to get worse if you don't put a stop to it and keep the baby away from her. \n\nStop letting her abuse you. \n\nYou forget that your a freaking adult, you are her equal and she can literally do bothing you but scream and send people to scream t you. \n\nStop entertaining her and her family. They can't punish you, so just stop. \n\nYOUR AN ADULT, HER EQUAL. STOP CATERING TO HER AND STOP MAKING PEACE WITH HER \n\nLet her have a freaking tantrum, scream and cry and send people to your house. Don't answer the phone, don't cater to her, don't open the door, and stop letting her into your life. \n\nYou really want baby to grow up thinking that it's OK for mil to abuse their parents, and the husband isn't supposed to shut their mother down when she's abusing the wife??\n\nYou need to cut mil off now.", "It sounds like your mil is what makes your life difficult... cut her off and enjoy life.", "So your mom cares more about your mil than you and you feelings? Yikes", "Sounds like it\u2019s time to go no-contact with the entire lot of them.", "Oh sweetie, he most certainly xlud he's just CHOOSING not to.", "Oh 100% and that\u2019s good! I would definitely attempt to set some strict boundaries and then stick to them. Sounds like you\u2019re doing good considering all the verbal attacks", "The reality is that OP's mom isn't the one sitting with the monster MIL, OP is the one who will suffer, who is suffering.  If OP gives in now then MIL will never stop and she will escalate, there is no appeasing this beast.", "Unfortunately she would rather just make excuses and continue contact since it's so much easier than leaving.", "I'm like a thank god I don't see his relative halfof the fking time . I made the greatest call to enroll my girl to school at 2 months and to move away from her. She wanted my hub to stay longer in her house. \n\n\nWe are tryinf to go no contact,  now co currently low contact until my hub gets the rest of his things from his mom's place . High chance it gonna happen once after baby first birthday. Cos there no longer a reason to invite them :/", "I'm numb . My mom was equally nuts when I was younger so when I turn 18 I left. I stayed with my dad went almost no contact for 4 years with my mom . I'm able to pull myself out . I really wanted to say some mean thing to her but for the love of my hub and he told me he can handle I decided to shut up but she know I'm mad. \n\nAt this point I really wanna go 0 contact especially since I'm.hurt . I treated her nice and I mean I tot she see me as a good person since she would tell their relative I'm good and all and she was rather proud of our achievements but I think eventually the cousin and sister manage to poison her. This whole henpeck shit started recently after the yelling issue during chinese new year.  That when things went down hill I feel.", "Yeah that's not how it works. \n\nIf you raise your kid right, to be a well adjusted adult and caring person then he would have no reason to cut you off. \n\nJust because you cut off abusive family, does not mean your kid will. That's not how that works. \n\nYou love him and treat him right, he won't have any reason to cut you of because your not toxic. \n\nAnd no, your husband does not have a responsibility to care for his parents. Culture or not, its not his responsibility to care for his parents. \n\nYour job is your child, not your abusive husband's families feelings. \n\nYou should be thinking of your child, not what's easier on you and your husband. \n\nStop making excuses. Their are bone for cutting off abusive people.", "Sometimes you have to do what\u2019s best for you without thinking of how others will feel.

You lived my life , you live my family life . You know how our culture works.  You totally know how everything works right :) . You do you sweetheart all I ask is should I apologise no need to get so up tight over the comments I share with others ya. :)", "No but everyone agrees that your comments sound like you making excuses. \n\nYeah it sucks to have this kind of family, I know from personal experience. \n\nBut I cut them out fr my kids sakes, and told my parents that they were on there own that I wouldn't be caring for the so don't count on me later in life. \n\nIt's so easy to say I can't do this and can't do that. Instead of just walking away. \n\nIf no one can force you to care fr the family or bein contact then just leave. \n\nHou ding you isn't forcing you. Just don't share your new address with anyone \n\nI feel for you, but some of your comments sound like yourmaking excuses. \n\nI hope it gets better for you and you won't talk or visit with them at all soon.", "I'm south asian and when. young, and visiting India would be constantly trashed by older relatives for being too: loud, laughing, fat (after puberty hit and I gained weight which wasn't abnormal) and dark.

The one that complain to his aunt about me.  Has a son who is violent and in my hub words a hazard . He would.hit his relative and his mom and the grandma would play it as he just a child.  Idk I feel.his family is has issues,  my hub never liked his relatives neither does he hangs with them . He was a more introvert person plus they use to bully him. maybe that's why he more normal"]}
