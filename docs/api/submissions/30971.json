And when you did prompt her, she admitted your point yet still dismissed it's validity. \n\nThis isn't a matter of who's the AH (though it's clearly her), this is a matter of you understanding that this is how she engages with the emotional experiences of others.

But she's the AH in any case.)", "NTA. A joke is only a joke if the victim thinks it's funny. Otherwise it's just poorly thought out bullying.  Your girlfriend seems immature and thoughtless; if she dismisses your feelings like this, is she even relationship material??

No, something like that could jeopardize a relationship and honestly you handled it very calmly. I know she's only 20 but that was too immature for even someone her age.

If she can see your point that you would've been heartbroken and this is her stance, she doesn't care about your feelings. Marriage and proposals are a huge deal, it's concerning that she thinks it's no big deal to joke about that, especially if she can see that you have a point. Also, people always go on about how much pressure public proposals in situations like this put on people, but doing this all while not even being serious about it is suddenly not a big deal? Nah, NTA dude.", "The \u201cit\u2019s not that deep\u201d line kids are saying these days is hilarious to me - it\u2019s taking pride in how shallow their thinking is.\n\nLike saying \u201cI\u2019m brainless\u201d, maybe the tiktok era consumption has made short attention spans and limited cognition \u201ccool\u201d, but especially when you say it in response to someone expressing how hurt or uncomfortable you\u2019ve made them, it\u2019s saying \u201cI don\u2019t have the capacity to care how you\u2019re feeling, or ability to think these implications through in advance. Im an idiot, and this shallow puddle of a mind is as deep as it gets\u201d. \n\nNTA, but your gf gives me the ick.

I understand what you are saying about being embarrassed but come on you can clearly see that the camera panned to you both. She didn't tell them to pan it round.
