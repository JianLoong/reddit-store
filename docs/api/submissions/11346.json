My mom got remarried about 3 years ago to my horrible stepdad. \n\nHe is so overbearing. He forced me to download Life360 on my phone and constantly yells at me for little stuff. He calls me lazy if I get home from school and take a nap, etc.\n\nI\u2019ve put up with his nonsense for the past 3 years, but I\u2019ve started to get fed up. I\u2019ve started talking back more and defending myself which seems to be making him angrier.\n\nThis happened yesterday night. I went to my friends house after school, I had already informed my mom about this.\n\nAbout 30 minutes into the hang out, I get a bunch of angry texts from my stepdad asking me where I was. I calmly texted him that I was at my friends house and he proceeded to send me a voice note telling me that he always needed to know where I was at at all times and that he needed to be informed as well. I told him that I already told my mom so I don\u2019t see the issue. He continued blowing up my phone with texts and calls so I put my phone on silent and ignored it.\n\nI completely forgot about my stepdad. About 20 minutes later though, we hear a knock at my friends door. My friend opens it and my step dad is standing there (I still don\u2019t know how he got the location??). He yells at me to come over and I come over reluctantly. He starts screaming at me and asks me why I am ignoring his texts and calls. I try to explain myself but he interrupts me. He then tells me to come outside which I do and he proceeds to scream in my face. \n\nAfter he finished his rant, I went back inside and he tried to follow me but my friend shut the door in his face. He started pounding on the door like a maniac and demanded to be let in. My friend told him he wasn\u2019t welcome but he refused to leave. I threatened to call the police and he didn\u2019t believe me. So I called them.\n\nHe ended up getting detained and taken back to my mothers house. When I got home my mother and stepdad screamed at me and called me an ungrateful brat. They took my phone and now I\u2019m grounded for a month. (Using my friends phone at school to post this.)\n\nI really don\u2019t think I was being an AH, but my other friend said calling the police was excessive.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677804782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gmhg8/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_stepdad/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He took this WAY too far. You told him where you were & informed him that your mom already knew. It sounds like he\u2019s got some control issues he needs to work on.

I stopped asking permission for anything,  and just ignored him.  Not the best thing, but he eventually left me mostly alone because I'd stonewall him.

As a former teacher who has a Criminal Justice degree, I urge you to speak with a trusted teacher as soon as possible.  Even if you can't get an appointment with your counselor (I know they can get pretty backed up), your teacher can get to them.  Your teacher is also a mandatory reporter, which means (s)he is required by law to report the sort of incidents you described.  Police officers/social workers will speak with you at school in a private area.  I had to report things a few times.  None of the reports were ever deemed \"unfounded.\"  That means the kids were believed.\n\nHe found your location either because your mother told him where your friend's house was or because he has a tracking app active on your phone.  It's unfortunate that the police merely returned him to your home.  They should have at least given your friend the opportunity to have him trespassed from the property.  I'm extremely concerned about your safety.  Something is definitely wrong with this situation.", "NTA. Sounds like abuse and your mother is allowing it. Can you go stay with a family member ? Where is your bio dad ?", "Absolutely not.  Your step-dad is a control freak.  If it was me, I would have called the cops, immediately, rather than threatening him.  What your step dad did was out of line, on, almost, every level.  Spying on you, like that, is a form of abuse of a minor.
