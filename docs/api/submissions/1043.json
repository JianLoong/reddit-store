My housemate \"Leanne\" who is a 2nd year mental health nursing student. I didn't know her before we moved in. She's older than me (25). I'm cordial but we don't have anything common. She's into the party scene and talks A LOT about all the drugs she takes. She also talks a lot about how mentally unstable she is. I'm not saying she should be ashamed but if it's such a big part of her identity I don't know if it's the right time for her to be working with vulnerable patients (student nurses in the UK do placements while training where they work as a member of staff). \n\nWe recently went to a club night for another housemate's birthday and Leanne was there. She was drunk/taking drugs as were some other housemates. I wasn't included because it's not my thing. I was a little drunk but still clearheaded. During the night Leanne was like \"oh my god, that guy was a patient at my last placement!\" and pointed a guy out to everyone. I thought she was saying it because she was worried so I suggested we go somewhere else. She said it was fine and she wanted to go over, she hugged him and start talking to him. I felt weird so I went to the outside area. \n\nA little later, Leanne and the guy came outside and she was going round introducing him to everyone. He said he was 19, he was quite good-looking which I guess is why she was all over him. He seemed like a bit of a mess though (he was thin with marks on his arms and he seemed a bit manic). He was talking about how rough his life was as if it was funny but it was just sad. Leanne laughed though and said stuff about herself almost like she was trying to outdo him. She was also offering him drugs and trying to get him to go to the bathroom with her. I tried to take her to the side to tell her I didn't think it was appropriate but she told me to f\\*\\*k off. I went home because I didn't want to be part of it. \n\nI was asleep but I woke up when Leanne and the guy got in at around 4am. They were being pretty loud. I could hear Leanne offering him more alcohol but he was saying he felt sick. I put music on my headphones because I didn't want to hear it and I guess I went back to sleep. Then I woke up again at about 7am and heard the guy throwing up in the bathroom for a while then leaving the house. Leanne didn't get up til about 4pm and looked really rough. I told her she'd been really inappropriate because he was a patient and seemed like he still wasn't well. She said it was none of my business and she's been avoiding me since. I've tried talking to other housemates and some agree she went too far but they don't want to cause drama. \n\nWIBTA if I reported her to her course? I don't know for sure they hooked up but I think she was inappropriate even if they didn't.

I thought she was saying it because she was worried **so I suggested we go somewhere else.** \u201d She was not concerned with violating divulging patient health care, she only brings it up after the fact she judged the nurses\u2019 personal choices, only brings it up in the comments after other have brought it up. She didn\u2019t say \u201chey don\u2019t divulge patients, not cool\u201d. She waited to accumulate some questionable personal choices of her nurse peer.  It really comes off immature. It comes off as\u2014if a well behaved peer divulged the same OP would not report. That is the immaturity.", "Because the only actual professional misconduct was not a big deal for you until you accumulated a bunch of her personal choices. You didn\u2019t react with \u201cdon\u2019t divulge inpatient info\u201d, you said let\u2019s go somewhere else because there might be interpersonal conflict. That is pure immaturity.", "Should she keep a record of every single person she ever comes into contact with as a nurse to make sure she never dates a patient ever? No right that would be unreasonable. Why do you think you get to decide what is appropriate or not? \nNurses getting drug tested is pretty standard practice.", "Yeah it was really uncomfortable. I know I keep saying it but he really didn't seem well. He kept mentioning things that sounded really traumatic like being hurt as a child and then laughing hysterically but also seeming like he was nearly crying. He said it was the anniversary of something horrible. A couple of times he started getting upset but went \"fuck it! It's fine! I'm fine!\" and repeating \"it's fine\" for a bit. But instead of being concerned for him, my housemate was just like \"YEAH! FUCK IT!\" and trying to \"cheers\" him. Some of the things he said seemed really random, one of the first things he said to me was \"I think I might be gay... do you think I might be gay?\" He seemed to really want an answer even though I never even met him before. \n\nI'm not saying he *should* feel embarrassed because he didn't do anything wrong but a lot of people would feel really anxious and humiliated if they said all that personal stuff to strangers when they were drunk/high/mentally unwell and I don't think it was fair for my housemate to encourage him. If he was someone I knew I would have wanted to encourage him to slow down and go somewhere quiet especially when he was upset. \n\nI know its not for me to say, but I honestly think my housemate thinks being mentally ill makes her cool and interesting and she doesn't seem to empathise that it's not like that for everyone. This poor boy seems to really be suffering and it was quite hard to see it especially when no one else seemed to want to do anything. \n\n(Edited for typos)", "Flat occiput (positional plagiocephaly) is *never* caused by a few minutes of obstetric forceps because babies' skull bones are separate and too moldable. The most common cause is leaving an infant of less than 6 mos lying on her back by herself in a crib a lot, but there are rarer causes. We can speculate why your mother would prefer to blame it on the \"intoxicated delivering doctor\".", "If you work in a specialism (mental health, sexual health, cancer care, etc) saying they\u2019re a former patient implies what they were treated for - I doubt he was in her care because he had an ingrowing toenail. Deductive disclosure is still a breach of confidentiality and anyone working in the NHS will have been taught this - she\u2019s committed misconduct (possibly gross with the wider context) even if it\u2019s not illegal.", "As they're in the u.k, and that's where I am, yes. I have no knowledge of other countries confidentiality laws.\n\nHowever, it would still be very inappropriate, particularly as a student or practicing health professional, to announce that he was a former inpatient under her care.", "This is less of a situation, but I used to volunteer to do peer support for other students. Even in that situation, in our training we\u2019re told not to interact with people we\u2019ve provided peer support for outside of the facility. And that\u2019s not even about nursing, which is much higher stakes. \n\nI think you\u2019re seeing it too separate as \u201cthis was another job\u201d but with nursing, it\u2019s more \u201cthis is what you\u2019re legally not allowed to do because you\u2019re a NURSE\u201d. Kind of like how if a doctor moves from one hospital to another, that doesn\u2019t mean confidentiality can be broken for all the other patients they\u2019ve treated at the old hospital.\n\nThe issue OP is having from my perspective is both the identification of the former patient, introducing the former patient to people (i.e. revealing name), and also not following duty of care. This guy said he was in a bad place and someone who\u2019s supposed to be a nurse encouraged him to do drugs, even pressured him to drink more even though he said \u201che wasn\u2019t feeling well\u201d? I think that is way more of an issue.", "He literally is much younger though, someone joked that he didn't look old enough to be at the club and he started showing his ID around to prove he's 19. Leanne is either 25 or 26. She was working in an inpatient ward which is for people who are severely ill and have to be in hospital for their own safety. Yes, we're in the UK. I actually didn't \"hate\" Leanne until she did this, I just didn't really get on with her.", ">Not true about the genders thing.\n\nIt's absolutely true. You thinking it isn't true doesn't refute centuries of precedence regarding how gender affects the type of behavior we're socialized to find acceptable.\n\n> But mostly, OP WBTA b/c she clearly hates Leanne. She has no GENUINE concern for the patient. \n\nThis is pure speculation on your part.", "I will get advice before actually reporting if that's what I decide to do. I just wanted to ask anonymously if it would be fair as if i ask for advice they might go ahead and report it anyway if they think it's serious enough. I want to be certain I'm comfortable doing it before I go any further. Thanks for your concern, I found the situation quite upsetting because he really didn't seem well and this might have made him worse. He also might regret saying so many personal things to strangers and whatever happened with my housemate.", "A lot of the points you keep making don't actually apply to nurse training or mental health services in the UK. \n\n1. Her placement was in a specific ward where she would have had lots of contact with all the patients for several months. All the patients would have been very ill. \n2. Student nurses aren't paid a salary so her rent has nothing to do with it. Her parents pay her rent and bills anyway so I'm sure she'll be fine. \n3. Someone who gets out of hospital will still be a patient of mental health services, they'll just be having outpatient treatment not inpatient treatment. People are often discharged when they're still quite ill because there is such a shortage of beds and someone else might need it even more. \n\nYou're right, I don't like her. I was fine just keeping my distance but I'm really uncomfortable with this. I don't see how you can assume I don't care about the guy's welfare or that he's definitely capable of reporting. \n\nIt's fine that you think id be wrong for reporting, I asked because I wasnt sure myself. I find it really weird though that you think there was no issues with what she did, especially when you said somewhere else you're 40. How would you feel if you had a son his age who was ill and someone who's supposed to be responsible treated him like that?", "I disagree that it was \"the only actual professional misconduct\" actually. And her personal choice was to offer drugs to a mentally ill person who was recently her patient, encourage him to drink a lot, then take him home with her. I haven't done a single thing about her \"personal choices\" before she did that and I haven't actually done anything now, I'm just trying to figure out what the right thing is to do. Can I ask what age you are? I really hope you're younger than me because this would be a strange attitude coming from an adult.", "I don't know how it works. I'm sure that could happen accidentally with nurses who have long careers but thats not the situation here. In this case she very obviously *did* remember him and worked with him very recently. In the short time I stuck around after she introduced him, I saw her on several occasions putting her arm around him or hugging him and literally saying \"Aww! You were always my favourite patient!\" \n\nAnd yeah I guess it isn't standard practice here with student nurses and least, I don't know any qualified nurses.", "We could speculate, certainly, but considering he was permanently relieved of his practice following an inquiry into my delivery, I don\u2019t see that it\u2019s necessary.", "I picked up that they were in the UK in the post, I was not sure where you were posting from.", "You have made a good case, you have changed my opinion  I agree OP would be correct to bring the roommates behavior to the attention of program administrators.", "I think gender MUST be the reason people think this is ok, I can't imagine anyone would be fine with a 25 year old man behaving the way Leanne did with an intoxicated mentally ill 19 year old woman who used to be his patient. If they were fine with it I'd seriously question their moral values just like I'm doing with the actual situation.", ">This is pure speculation on your part.\r  \n\r\n\nBecause I can read. She lists a whole bunch of criticisms about Leanne's lifestyle and never once mentions her concern about the kid. She does speculate about his age (he could be 30!), that he is manic & a cutter. That's on her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You thinking it isn't true doesn't refute centuries of precedence regarding how gender affects the type of behavior we're socialized to find acceptable.\n\nAlso, not true, but tbh even if reported, Leanne won't get fired or even reprimanded. All Leanne has to say is \"my roommate is a bitch, and it's the other way around - he recognized me\". But either way, it's really easy to lose people in a nightlife neighborhood ( - a female who repeatedly ditched people that harassed me at bars the entirety of my 20s, including inappropriate clients).  The guy wouldn't be around hours later. (And I don't like the implication from other commenters that Leanne \"caused a relapse\" - he is in a bar!)", "You also might see him professionally at some point in your future practice. You'll get to know some patients well, and I'm sure you'll work again with people that you first met in placement. More to the point, she might work with him again.\n\nI can understand why you bought it to an anonymous place first, but reddit tends to be a very divisive platform, without understanding of the in depth issues that you're having to think about (nmc code, nhs values, professional boundaries, safeguarding, MHA....all that stuff).\n\nYes, if the person you talk to believes its serious enough, it might be reported. If they think its a safeguarding issue, they have to. I can't advise you on what to do, but look after yourself, and I wish you all the best in your career. The second year of training is hard, make sure you take time for yourself, even if it's hard to find any!", "She is a student nurse and as such, is bound by confidentiality laws. She CANNOT identify someone as a former patient. You must report her to the college or to the NMC. Student nurses must by their conduct 'uphold the reputation of the profession'. I know that this might seem a daunting proposition for you but you are already aware that this student's behaviour is inappropriate or you would not have posted.", "I'm 32. My friend is my lawyer and yet he gave me weed in a national park (federally illegal) in the presence of others. Did I go report him to the Bar? No, and if I were a lawyer I wouldn't either. I'm glad you are thinking about this deeply though, because it may bite you if you do report, or don't report. I know enough to not report in the above case. I don't know here, I would suggest seeking the mentorship of a peer you can trust who would know what to do before reporting, including you were drinking too, waited to report, and the friend group may or may not corroborate, the nurse may lie, etc. My \"grow up\" doesn't mean you WBTA for reporting, it's more make your reasoned choice and don't regret it - maturity.", "That is pretty irrefutable evidence of intoxication, & strong evidence of impaired performance.", "It's absolutely the reason some people are giving Leanne a pass.", "> Because I can read. She lists a whole bunch of criticisms about Leanne's lifestyle and never once mentions her concern about the kid. She does speculate about his age (he could be 30!), that he is manic & a cutter. That's on her.\n\nLOL, it's speculation when other people read into OP's words, but when you do it, you're just, like, stating the facts, man. Seems reasonable.\n\n>Also, not true...\n\nYour point seems to be not that Leanne did nothing wrong, but that Leanne could undermine OP's credibility sufficiently to experience zero consequences. I'm feeling more and more like YTA in this conversation.", "*Can* you read though? \n\n- \"he could be 30!\" - he's literally 19, he was showing his ID because he looked younger. I didn't just pull that number out of the air. \n- I used the word \"manic\" to describe how he was behaving (edit - the link didnt work but theres a comment un my history describing how he was acting).  I wasn't trying to diagnose him with bipolar disorder. He could have been agitated, upset and uninhibited for a lot of reasons. I'm not a mental health expert but the word manic doesn't just mean bipolar. \n- His arms were covered in old looking and new looking cuts and a couple of bandages/dressings. I didn't have to be a psychiatrist to make that assumption. \n- It's not up to me what the consequences are, I just feel very worried about doing nothing at all. I feel sick thinking about it. \n- I really don't care if you were able to ditch people in bars, how is that relevant. If a vulnerable person doesn't walk away from a risk situation does that mean they deserve anything that happens next? Gross. \n\nI don't think you've responded to a single one of my comments where I clarify information btw.", "Thanks for the advice. I'm actually not a student nurse, I'm on a different course. That's part of why I'm not fully confident if I would be doing the right thing or what the consequences might be for her. It just seems like common sense to me that her behaviour was inappropriate even if she wasn't in a professional setting at the time. I guess another reason to report would be that a professional might want to check in with the guy to see if he's alright. I know that's not my business but it was concerning and I hope he has support.", "Ok well I'm definitely younger than that and I know I'm obviously still figuring things out. Thank you for being polite in your reply and I'm sorry I wasn't that polite. I don't personally think the example you gave is the same at all. They weren't friends so before that they only knew each other as student nurse and patient. He was very obviously in a bad frame of mind (I described what I mean by that in another comment that should be near the top of my history if you're interested). And she brought him home with her even though he was very recently her patient, he was not someone she had a personal relationship with outside that, he was upset/unwell, and he was very intoxicated. I know she wasn't just trying to look after him because she was trying to get him to do shots when they got in even though he said he didn't feel well. \n\nI'm really trying to think through whether i report which is why I wanted anonymous advice. I don't want to do something like that if it's not justified.", "Ah, okay. That makes it even more difficult in a way. If you were a nursing student, it would put more obligation on you to speak up about it. As a non nursing student, it would be more appropriate to speak to a third party such as student services.\n\nI do commend you on your compassion for the people affected, and for your instincts to get advice, and carefully weigh before you act. Everything about reflection and self care still applies! Any form of study is hard work, but worth it for lots of reasons.\n\nGood luck in your studies, whatever you're doing, I'm sure you'll succeed.", "You're doing the right thing by figuring it out and you're more polite than I was. I'm just a voice among the masses. Trying to put myself in your shoes, I'd hope there's someone more senior at work who can give guidance for *your own best interests* and I wish you luck and your patients are lucky to have you.", "I've been looking and the university has a \"safeguarding\" department which I think would make sense to speak to rather than her course."]}
