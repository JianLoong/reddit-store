Well, I mean, staying married is definitely to the benefit of the children, and if no other reasons applied, then yes, that would be enough reason for you to live a miserable life, because what's more important than being a good role model for your children? You really want to teach your children that relationships are dumb, that marriage means nothing and that you should not try to work on your relationships? That you should just throw in the towel? You want your kids to get into situations like the one presented by OP, where they get into personal struggles between the divorced parents and even third parties, ergo step-\"parents\"? There is nothing worse than getting a divorce for your children, it is literal abuse. You are destroying the foundation that they base their entire live on, their nuclear family, ripping it apart and forcing your children to readjust their whole existence, and for what? For your happiness? Seeing the person you swore eternal love to build a life with someone else, having to start from scratch yourself, and having to navigate the absurd complexities of dealing with ex-spouses and their new partners alike while still trying to keep up a healthy relationship with your permanently scarred kids who are getting influenced by third parties against your will? Does that mean happiness?\n\nYou should not stay married for the childrens sake, even if that would be a good reason on its own. But there is a much more important and much simpler reason why you should never get a divorce: Because it's impossible. When you say \"till death do us part\", then only death may do you part. If you swear eternal loyalty to your partner, then you owe that to them. There is no getting out of that vow, you can only betray it, which is what divorce means. You don't even have to be religious to see how deeply immoral that is.", ">You realize that marriage as a social concept has been around for longer than whatever mythology you believe in, right?\n\nDid you just prove my point? I think you did. That's exactly what I am saying. Husband and Wife has alwass been what Man and Woman ought to be, and it was always regarded as sacred, no matter the religion. \n\n>Marriage is about as \"sacred\" as any other social contract. \n\nWrong. Literally no one saw it that way until nihilistic idiots came around to destroy the family a few decades ago, resulting in massive divorce rates, the breakdown of the nuclear family, depression and loneliness. Marriage has always been regarded as sacred, because my definition, it is. If it's not sacred, then ontologically, it cannot be a marriage, because a marriage by definition is a sacred institution.\n\n>The fact that you grew up in a home with a forced, loveless, toxic marriage has left you with scarring.\n\nYes it did. While I am glad that my parents worked on their relationship and did not get divorced, they were (and still are) not religious and did not regard their marriage as sacred. If they had, I would have had to suffer way less, and they would have had it much easier. No man is without fault. \n\nBut I can live with the scarring I have.
