So, I decided to take her for a weekend trip there on her birthday at the very beginning of June.

I also mentioned that I'll never again plan any trip for her if she doesn't want to contribute in any way.\n\nNow she is mad at me, because apparently I ruined her birthday and \"she doesn't need plan to have a good trip\".

You sound so much like my sister, it\u2019s wild. I was offered a trip overseas for my graduation gift one year and I was so so excited.

Two days in and my sister yelled at me at a restaurant for not having an outline of places to go to. Another day in and I was told that she had made plans and I couldn\u2019t go do my own thing because \"this is a family vacation too.\" A lot of other things happened on that trip that made is a miserable experience for me, but suffice to say that she *did* ruin what was supposed to be a celebration for me with her attitude.\n\nWhile I get your frustration, it really sounds like you didn\u2019t discuss this much with her beforehand and just told her what you expected based on your planning preferences.

Neither way is right or wrong, but when you have someone of each style there are often going to be issues.

So the fact that she even went might be significant if she had romantic dreams.

Sometimes you don't smile out loud, and it doesn't mean you're unhappy.", "i couldn\u2019t agree more.  i live in a tourist city and have for forty years.  in those years i have never done the stupid, in my opinion, crap that is in guide books.  when i travel i feel the same way.  enjoy wandering, see what i see, watch people, listen to the world around me and go home with terrific memories of a time well spent.  the idea of tourist attractions and lines makes my skin crawl.", "i don\u2019t know why you are getting down voted.  the idea of waiting in lines to do what others consider to be \u201c must do \u2018s \u201c sounds hideous to me.  just because it is a tourist trap doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t lovely things to do that aren\u2019t in some stupid guide book.", "Funnily enough, this reminds me of why I don\u2019t talk to my dad and grandma anymore.\n\nFor years, my grandma has been wanting to travel but for some reason can\u2019t leave the country or do anything because she is scared she\u2019ll die on an airplane. Okay then, I booked a visit and overnight stay at Epcot, 2 hours away, which would be like basically the same thing for her.\n\nWe all talked about that Epcot trip for a year and seemed all excited, I planned it and made sure EVERYTHING was up to her and my dads standard (because she complains about everything, and my dad complains about her). Well, when I flew in from across the country for this trip, they tried to see if they could worm their way out \u201cfor my sake\u201d because I must be tired. They even tried to be like \u201cthere won\u2019t be separate AC for grandma to make it hot\u201d and I was like \u201cI\u2019ll sweat then for the night so she can enjoy the trip\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s day of, we are driving to Epcot (which mind you, another reason we were all excited was to eat all around the world). My dad made it a point and was throwing a hissy fit that he HAD to eat a full breakfast on the way about halfway through (we woke up extra early, and again, it\u2019s only 2 hours)\u2026.he then tried to force me and my partner to eat, which we refused. He wouldn\u2019t start the car until we each took a bite.\n\nGot to the park, and after 15 minutes and 1 quick ride, my grandma said she wanted to go back home because she was done with the park. Mind you, we got a hotel nearby that at that point we could no longer cancel. I honestly thought she was joking, and mentioned that we paid nearly 3000 dollars for this trip (including airfare to visit them an extra time that year during the most expensive season, and a really nice hotel suite for all of us to split since we needed 3 rooms). They were \u201cfine\u201d with it, then told me and my partner to enjoy a ride without them (we went on a ride with no line, so again in and out ~10 minutes total)\u2026.only to find that they binge ate an entire Chinese meal in those 10 minutes and are now too full for the rest of the day.\n\nWe told them they could leave and that we could get a taxi later at that point if they really weren\u2019t enjoying themselves (because they were still complaining about how everything wasn\u2019t to their standards), which they were insulted by that and that I wasn\u2019t just shutting up and letting them complain to me constantly.\n\nEventually, it came time for the special Disney fireworks show that was only happening for their anniversary or something, and it was 5 minutes before, only for my dad to publicly pick a fight with me because \u201cI looked mad\u201d. I wasn\u2019t mad, I was hungry (they didn\u2019t let us break off anymore to go get food for the whole day after the Chinese food incident because they weren\u2019t hungry, all I was able to get was a pretzel while walking by a free stand, and my partner at this moment was trying to get me a meal while we were waiting), and the last time I was at at Disney I actually had a seizure (and similar situation that day, barely ate). I reminded my dad of that seizure, which I told him of when it happened, only for him to say *to my face* he thought I was making it up for attention(??????)\n\nSo fucking offended by that still, since it takes a lot for me to admit I\u2019m even in pain or hurt. They could have even verified and asked my partner, who was with me and was able to catch me and put me down gently on the floor\u2026\n\nAnyways, he kept on escalating the fight and honestly, I\u2019m trained in deescalating conflict now and so I used those techniques only for him to get even MORE mad and said that I must think I\u2019m a psychology god for \u201cknowing how to get to him\u201d (I was just like, I\u2019m not fighting, but it seems like you\u2019re upset, are you okay? What\u2019s really going on?). It ended with him getting physical with me, mind you at this point we are SURROUNDED by a giant crowd of people because the fireworks show was already starting. Security had to get involved, but damn\u2026.the fact he thought I was still 6 and not 30+ and that he was in his right or something to physically hurt me.\n\nOh, and I found out later from relatives that they were saying I was super drunk and high and attacking them to try and safe face\u2026lmaoo what??? I was his golden child daughter before and it was known that I don\u2019t like drinking (not a fan of the taste) and only smoke weed as far as drugs go\u2026which you can\u2019t do in Florida w/o a medical license and I was only there for 2 days. Also, I called my cousin 5 minutes after my dad got physical and security was with us and told her what happened, so lol to my dad for not knowing I knew he\u2019d do that!\n\nSo yeah, fuck planning trips for people like this lmaoo!!!", "I wholeheartedly agree!", "I'm amazed you would even go on a trip with people like that in the first place. This couldn't have been new behavior, could it?", "They were the last of my nuclear family I had contact with, and I was just trying too hard to make us a happy family. Chasing my dad and grandmas love (before thinking \u201cdo I like them as people?\u201d lol)\n\n I am a shame baby to both of my parents and their families. I was isolated and never met any of my extended relatives besides the two times, three days each, I visited the old country when I was like 8 and 11. \n\nMy mom got pregnant before marriage with me (in a highly religious country), and my wealthy capital city dad knocked up my super tiny village farmer\u2019s daughter of a mom. My mom kept me to come to America, parents divorced quickly afterwards, and she ended up (along with her bf) doing SA shit to me from ages 7-18. Oh, btw, that bf?? My dads best friend from college she cheated on my dad with, because he has more money.\n\nSo I thought my dad was better than my mom, and I was looking for feeling like I was part of a family as an adult. I thought I was kept away from my dad all my life, but really, he only wanted to see me once a year or two for a few days and that\u2019s it (because I take too much of his vacation days when I visit, even though i always told him he never had to take off and it was nice just hanging with him like I lived there).\n\nBetween going NC with my mom and going NC with my dad, there was only about 2 visits (including that Epcot trip). I think I needed to go NC with my mom first, process that, to fully see my dad for who he was and that there were things I didn\u2019t like that before I would look over. \n\nHe would hit on high school and college girls (always in service roles where they had to be nice to him), in front of me, in really sickening ways. He kinda brainwashed me about being abusive too - he\u2019d call slaps \u201ccookies\u201d, and then tell me he was giving his girlfriends cat cookies all the time and after a while I forgot what we were talking about and would think he was being nice and giving cookies and I\u2019d ask about the cookies. He called any young attractive girl \u201ca chicken\u201d he was going to get. I started calling him out on that those last two visits, and that didn\u2019t go well either. Honestly, I feel like he wanted to get close to me as an adult and over the last few years because I actually made some money and a name for myself (I\u2019m an artist, and have work hung in galleries around the world now). He only visits me if I move to a new city, and makes it a trip for him and his gf and uses me as a free hotel spending the whole day out and coming back only for sleep, and will never visit me again. My grandma asked me for 30k on that Epcot trip so she could buy a second home (a trailer in the middle of nowhere, when she can\u2019t drive and needs to see a doctor each week).\n\nIt\u2019s weird though\u2026I wanted family my entire life, but now that I no longer talk to these toxic people, I feel more relieved and at peace. Maybe I\u2019ve just accepted the card I was dealt, and am more than okay with the concept of chosen family because that means I get the opportunity to surround myself with good people (when I find them) who actually love me with no strings attached\u2026and that I\u2019m not tied to anyone just because we share DNA.", "NTA Unfortunately she is very self centered. If she had to pay for her half of the trip, I\u2019ll bet she wouldn\u2019t have acted this way. While I don\u2019t travel well with my siblings, we always made basic plans knowing stuff can change. Pretty much a requirement if you are traveling during high tourist season.", "Or here\u2019s a thoughts OPs sister didn\u2019t care about doing all the touristy stuff and just wanted to visit the town.", "So why not tell OP that?", "I assume they were American or Canadian?", "That's highly likely. Blown away by the gift, but having trouble enjoying it knowing what it's costing the giver.", "I imagine OP knows more about how her sister acts when she's excited than you do.", "I\u2019m so sorry. Your family kinda sucks :/ I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve realised you\u2019re better off without them tho."]}
