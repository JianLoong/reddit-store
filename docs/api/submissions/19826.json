{"id": 19826, "submission_id": "14avzb6", "title": "AITA for telling my sister that our weekend trip for her birthday was a mistake?", "selftext": "My (F29) sister Meg (F25) mentioned many times that she wanted to visit one particular town in the southern part of our country. What's important for the story, the town in question is always full of tourists and lines to museums, restaurants and basically everywhere are very long. In summer you have to reserve tickets to some places long time before your trip if you want to visit them at all.\n\nPersonally I don't like overly touristic places but Meg's previous visit to given town went poorly and it remained an unfulfilled dream of hers. So, I decided to take her for a weekend trip there on her birthday at the very beginning of June. I told her beforehand that I'll pay for the hotel, train and some of tickets/restaurant bills but she has to make a list of places she wants to see, so I can make a reservation. I gave her a \"deadline\" - second half of May - so I can make reservations etc.\n\nMay 15th came, I asked her if she has the list ready. She hadn't. No biggie, I gave her few additional days. May 21st, still nothing. Eventually I booked some places I found interesting myself (some of them were no longer available anyway).\n\nIn the end, she didn't give me a list at all. We went for a trip, seen the things I was able to book or we were able to see without reservations. But, what upset me, was that even when we reached our destination, she still didn't really knew what she wanted to see. (She only twice during the trip mentioned that she's interested in seeing something - both places were unavailable or had very, very long lines.)  All the time her behaviour was like \"meh, anyway\" - even though it was her who in the last three years constantly mentioned visiting this town. I was feeling as if I was babysitting and forcing a toddler to see things she wasn't interested in.\n\nI also want to mention that I don't earn much and the trip, even for only a weekend, was hard for my budget, especially as I paid for almost everything.\n\nEventually I snapped at her that if she has no idea what she's doing here, she shouldn't constantly mention the place as she can sit in her room and play on her phone at home instead of this town. I also mentioned that I'll never again plan any trip for her if she doesn't want to contribute in any way.\n\nNow she is mad at me, because apparently I ruined her birthday and \"she doesn't need plan to have a good trip\". I didn't want her to plan every second of the trip, only an outline, so I was able to make reservations.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686919658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14avzb6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_our_weekend_trip/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I understand not wanting to have a trip planned down to the second, with this kind of place, that's very touristy and typically requires reservations, you need to at least have an outline of what you want to do, just so you can make the proper reservations. And if I were you, I would probably be upset by your sister's \"meh\" attitude too, especially if she's been talking about this for three years and then when it happens- nothing.", "NTA\n\nSo this town was meant to be her dream destination, but she had no idea what she wanted to see?\n\nHow can this place possible be her dream when she apparently knows nothing about the place and doesn't have a list of places she wants to see?\n\nI am planning my dream holiday for next year, I have wanted to go for years, my difficulty is cutting out things I want to do/go as I only have a limited time to visit.\n\nI wouldn't bother planning anything for her in the future. Plan what you want to do or go and see. Tell your sister this is where I am going and this is what I am doing, you are welcome to come with me (paying for herself). She either goes with you or you go by yourself or another friend.", "NTA, when you need to make reservations to go places then that needs planning. If your sister is such a fan of the town she'd know this", "NTA\n\nMy brother is like that. More than once I found myself in some big european city with him and his gf and they both were like, let's just look around. \nYes, sure, you can do that. \nBut not every City has some touristy hotspot where everything is gathered. And many places come with long waiting lines, huge crowds or are closed on some days. \nSo you may not want to plan your visit like a general going to war, but some planing is helpful! Otherwise you sit around in a mediocre restaurant in one of the most beautiful foodie cities on earth...", "The only reason you would be the asshole is \u2018cause you provided monetary support for this trip.\n\nNTA", "I think NAH.  I\u2019ve been in the sister\u2019s shoes before, and had no plan and part of the charm was in getting to the destination.  The blowback for the sister is that she just couldn\u2019t visit some of the places she may have wanted, which she seemed to be fine with.  However, because this city is known for being touristy and not conducive for a \u201cfree spirit\u201d type of trip from the sounds of things, she should have taken that more into consideration, and OP isn\u2019t an AH because she made the plans, paid the money, and it seems left feeling taken for granted over this trip.  OP, I wish the best of luck for both you and your sister\u2014from one \u201colder sis\u201d to another.", "NTA. A good deed got punished.", "ESH - your sister for her 'meh' attitude and you also because you overreacted to her 'meh' attitude. It's not your job to force people to feel or react the way that you think they should. It sounds like your sister is extremely 'laidback' and you definitely require a set plan beforehand. You have different personalities, so of course, you will clash", "YTA for making a big deal out of this. Your sister is just not a planner. You could have let her just wander around to get the feel of the place. You gave her the trip she wanted but got mad because she didn't want more. You could also have saved a lot of money by not booking anything that she didn't ask for.", "ESH.  No one made you plan or pay for this trip - you decided to by yourself.  It was a nice idea but obviously your sister wasn't into it.  You made yourself a martyr for no reason. Her attitude sucked but you also brought this on yourself.", "ESH. Not everyone plans things to do on vacation, they just see where the winds take them", "> I also want to mention that I don\u2019t earn much and the trip, even for only a weekend, was hard for my budget\n\nIs it possible your sister was anxious/excited about this trip and couldn\u2019t pick things to do because she was worried about straining your budget and was having trouble articulating that?", "YTA. You sound so much like my sister, it\u2019s wild. I was offered a trip overseas for my graduation gift one year and I was so so excited. I had cities and neighborhoods I wanted to explore, but I just wanted to wander and see where I ended up, stop into stores I thought were interesting, eat where it looked good, take my time. Two days in and my sister yelled at me at a restaurant for not having an outline of places to go to. Another day in and I was told that she had made plans and I couldn\u2019t go do my own thing because \"this is a family vacation too.\" A lot of other things happened on that trip that made is a miserable experience for me, but suffice to say that she *did* ruin what was supposed to be a celebration for me with her attitude.\n\nWhile I get your frustration, it really sounds like you didn\u2019t discuss this much with her beforehand and just told her what you expected based on your planning preferences. You\u2019re not compatible travel companions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
