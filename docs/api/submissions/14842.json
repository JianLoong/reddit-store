It is something I tried pursuing years ago, but I had opportunities ruined by my own family who I no longer associate with (including ruining a living opportunity just before I was about to start college) as well as constantly encouraged to pursue another path because it's not right for me and my personality.\n\nI was already studying IT at community college when I met my now fiancee, and the living opportunity I mentioned was ruined a few months after we became a couple. It really crushed my spirit and I lost confidence in myself and my abilities. About 9 months ago, I finally built up the confidence to give it another go at college since we had moved to another town. I have always had a love for technology and keeping up with the latest tech developments, etc. I've wanted to work in the industry since I was a kid.\n\nMy fiancee entered the IT field him 2 years ago and I was/am super happy for him.\nEvery time I have told anybody my fiancee knows (family, friends) that I'm studying IT, they immediately ask \"Oh the same thing as (fiancee's name)?\" or \"To do what he is doing?\" or other similar phrases. Whenever I see them, I am still constantly questioned if I'm aiming for what my fiancee does, will be working with him at his workplace etc., or just general comments as though he helped me to find my path. It feels belittling, as though I'm only entering a field because my fiancee is doing it and it's an \"easy\" option, or because he's helping me or something. I'm aiming for a different field to what he works in and I am chasing my own career. I have repeatedly answered no and that I will be persuing my own path. \n\nIt also hurts that they have seemingly forgotten what I went through 4 years ago with the ruined college opportunity, and I love my partner but I am sick of people crediting him for my choice of career because it is something I'm genuinely passionate about.\n\nI snapped back the other day at his parents (not in an agressive, loud or angry manner, just in a bit of annoyed tone) and said \"I have my own wants, desires and abilities and I would appreciate if I was asked more about me and my own interests instead of crediting [fiancee's name].\" My fiancee said I was a bit too harsh and that we should sit down and explain where I'm at.

My fiancee thinks I was harsh and that I need to be the one to teach them more about me and sit down with them to explain myself.

Especially if they are aware of what you went through with your parents.", "NTA. If your fiance's family knew about what you went through four years ago, and are still running with that narrative of \"oh to do what he's doing?\" that would be incredibly frustrating to me. \n\nI think you're right in your assesment and it is condescending, especially if it's something you're hearing over and over again from various people. I think if the question was framed as \"did you bond over that interest\" etc it would obviously be fine, but people automatically attributing your lifelong interest and expertise in this area to your boyfriend is really patronising. And maybe something to do with the field being quite male dominated and (wrongly) seen as \"masculine\". \n\nMaybe you were a little bit harsh in snapping  - but tbh if I got the same patronising assumption over and over I would eventually snap too! I don't think you're being too sensitive at all. Maybe it could be worth apologising for snapping and talking though all this with his parents so they can see where you're coming from.", "ESH.\n\nIt is *really* frustrating for your efforts to be tied to someone and not your own merit. I get that a billion percent! That said, people are awkward and are trying to make conversation with you on something they don\u2019t know (most likely) as much about as you and are likely far more innocent in their questions, even if again, it is super annoying. \n\nIf you want to really improve this, talking it out before you reaching the snapping point is your best bet.\n\nWay to not give up on your aspirations, I hope things work out wonderfully for you.", "First of all, congratulations, you deserve to be proud of yourself for finding your way back through time, sabotage, and just life stuff to pursue your dream. Go you! That being said, just the slightest whiff of a gentle breeze, yta. I think you really have to take a deep breath and look at people's intentions. They don't know your story, or not the whole story, and a lot of times people like to put other's lives in safe little boxes and well-worn tropes. \n\nMaybe the next time someone flings that dismissive talk out there, just laugh a little and say, \"No, actually, I've been pursuing this my whole life. Isn't it great that bf and have such similar interests?\"", "It is belittling. Absolutely. I think you snapped because you are always told to be polite, and you kept it in until you hit your limit with the nasty comments. In that, you were a bit of an AH, but not for standing up for yourself. In the future, tell people immediately and calmly when they are being rude for ignoring your own achievements and desires. If this is fianc\u00e9's family, he needs to tell them to stop doing this.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I think part of the issue is that (relatively speaking) there are relatively few women in STEM fields.  Thus, if you say you are studying IT and so is your male fiance', it is easy to assume that he led you in that direction.\n\nI've been in IT since the '80s (yes, I am old as dirt).  I've worked with many thousands of people of all job titles related to IT.  To this day, the smartest, most efficient IT person I've ever met was a female network administrator who happened to be an Air Force NCO at the time.  She taught me a LOT.  I've held senior SA and NA positions, been chosen to manage world-wide teams of SAs, but met this young lady about 5 years ago and wow....\n\nWhat impressed me most is the few times I was stumped, I could call her for help.  She always had the exact information I needed (pulling from her own memory) without having to Google it.  Amazing.  The two of us together made a legendary team.  I've got mad respect for her.\n\nI know (beyond any doubt) that women can excel in the IT field.  But there's so few women who even think to try.  Sigh...\n\nThe IT field is changing, even swiftly within the past few years.  Two words you need to keep in the back of your mind as you are choosing your specialty.  \"CLOUD\" and \"SECURITY\".  If you are starting your IT career now (or soon) you need to be focused on cloud services, network security, or somewhere those overlap.  Be a white hat hacker, helping to secure cloud services.  If you can do that, you can name your price, practically write your own paychecks....\n\nAnd all other jobs in IT will be declining sharply soon, due to things like cloud services and AI.", "NTA - People always conflate \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201charsh\u201d. You were direct. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were harsh though.", "I think you are depressed and should explore counseling. You didn\u2019t have to snap at his parents. You seem way too sensitive when people are probably just trying to be friendly. You might respond by saying  \u201cthis is a career path I\u2019ve been passionate about for as long as I can remember.\u201d and leave it at that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like you are carrying hurt and disappointment from your first attempt at study, which is perfectly normal. People who know your fianc\u00e9 are making a logical connection: he does a thing, now you do the thing, they must be related. \n\nOP, duckling - you are being too sensitive. Of course you have your own goals and dreams, no one OSS saying otherwise. Do some reflection and you\u2019ll see that there is nothing to be mad about here.", "Soft YTA. I get it. But unless you explain, most people are going to jump to that generalisation. \n\nWhich is what you did, but probably a bit too harshly.\n\nIf you can, tell people you've been wanting to get into it for years and then give him some real competition in the field, something humorous but that shows you're not just 'following ' him around.", "Yeah I do think it is mostly the way the questions are being asked/how the comments are being made. Whether it is there intent or not, it does come across as a bit condescending.\n\nI have a feeling they either completely forgot about the experience I had four years ago or they just didn't realize how much it affected me.\n\nThanks for your comment and advice, I appreciate it.", "I appreciate your perspective. I thought too that it may be just awkward small talk, but I personally would never feel comfortable bringing somebody else into an individual's own choices or accomplishments. I know that nobody has any malice though. I have just never known how to respond to questions/comments like that. As well as knowing that my fiancee and his family were in the picture when I had that college experience ruined for me.\n\nThank you for your kind words anon!", "Thanks for your comment.\n\nI don't believe my fiancee's family are misogynistic in any way, but I think it is just natural in society to assume certain jobs with men and women.\nI believe my family on the other hand, who sabotaged past opportunities, are a different story.\n\nAlso yes, cyber security is the field I'm shooting towards.", "I have responded with that, but it feels as though it is forgotten and the same comments are made whenever I see them next.\nWe live kind of far away from them so we see them every 2-3 months, so it is a long time in between seeing them and it would be fair to assume that conversations have been forgotten. But it is still frustrating.\n\nI do have struggles with mental health as a result of various experiences, and I am working through it so hopefully I can learn to disconnect my past experiences from current situations.\n\nThanks for your perspective.", "You could answer things like \"we are on the same page, we like the same stuff, our brains are wired the same way, we this and we that, fiance and I have this in common, etc\", talking about how alike you are and how much you share the same interests instead of pointing out who was first to study what or how a career olan all started \n\nIt would be a way to make your point while keeping a civil discussion going\n\nYou know who you are, your fiance knows you as well, it's ok, you'll succeed anyway", "NTA. It\u2019s annoying and doesn\u2019t speak well of your fianc\u00e9s family that they apparently can\u2019t see you as your own person but merely an extension of your fianc\u00e9.\n\nWhat\u2019s Really Not a good look though is the fact that your fianc\u00e9 never correct them or stand up for you. Apparently he\u2019s fine with you just being a shadowy in his life. \n\nI\u2019d be having some Serious conversations with him about it.\n\nBecause you should Not be with someone who won\u2019t put you at least on the same place as themselves and be ready to defend you when people makes assumptions about you.", "The delay in pursuing your IT career is clearly a really sensitive spot for you. That's okay, we all have things that get our back-up it's how we manage the defensive impulse that matters.\n\nYou mentioned you would never feel comfortable bringing others into somebody else's choices or accomplishments. Which is fine but socially it's a very accepted and even encouraged practice. Pretty much anyone being acknowledged for anything starts off their acceptance speech by thanking all the ppl who inspired, encouraged or assisted them on that path. Likewise, interviewers often ask who inspired a person or who supported them. This question isn't asked to diminish the interviewees work, passion or commitment but rather to draw out the person's story and show interest in the journey.\n\nI really don't think anyone was in any way looking to diminish your achievement or credit your partner. It sounds like they were just trying to be nice, show interest and maybe draw out your story. You may find that if you lower your defences a bit and respond with a simple \"actually, this is something I've been working towards for a long time, well before BF, but I'm so glad he shares my passion\" that you get to have meaningful conversations about what drew you to the industry. Right now I doubt anyone you snapped at will show interest in what your doing for some time.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Just say that he is copying you and not the other way around."]}
