If your fiance's family knew about what you went through four years ago, and are still running with that narrative of \"oh to do what he's doing?\" that would be incredibly frustrating to me. \n\nI think you're right in your assesment and it is condescending, especially if it's something you're hearing over and over again from various people. I think if the question was framed as \"did you bond over that interest\" etc it would obviously be fine, but people automatically attributing your lifelong interest and expertise in this area to your boyfriend is really patronising. And maybe something to do with the field being quite male dominated and (wrongly) seen as \"masculine\". \n\nMaybe you were a little bit harsh in snapping  - but tbh if I got the same patronising assumption over and over I would eventually snap too!

I think you snapped because you are always told to be polite, and you kept it in until you hit your limit with the nasty comments. In that, you were a bit of an AH, but not for standing up for yourself. In the future, tell people immediately and calmly when they are being rude for ignoring your own achievements and desires.

Thus, if you say you are studying IT and so is your male fiance', it is easy to assume that he led you in that direction.\n\nI've been in IT since the '80s (yes, I am old as dirt).  I've worked with many thousands of people of all job titles related to IT.  To this day, the smartest, most efficient IT person I've ever met was a female network administrator who happened to be an Air Force NCO at the time.  She taught me a LOT.  I've held senior SA and NA positions, been chosen to manage world-wide teams of SAs, but met this young lady about 5 years ago and wow....\n\nWhat impressed me most is the few times I was stumped, I could call her for help.  She always had the exact information I needed (pulling from her own memory) without having to Google it.  Amazing.  The two of us together made a legendary team.  I've got mad respect for her.\n\nI know (beyond any doubt) that women can excel in the IT field.  But there's so few women who even think to try.  Sigh...\n\nThe IT field is changing, even swiftly within the past few years.  Two words you need to keep in the back of your mind as you are choosing your specialty.  \"CLOUD\" and \"SECURITY\".  If you are starting your IT career now (or soon) you need to be focused on cloud services, network security, or somewhere those overlap.  Be a white hat hacker, helping to secure cloud services.  If you can do that, you can name your price, practically write your own paychecks....\n\nAnd all other jobs in IT will be declining sharply soon, due to things like cloud services and AI.", "NTA - People always conflate \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201charsh\u201d.

But unless you explain, most people are going to jump to that generalisation. \n\nWhich is what you did, but probably a bit too harshly.\n\nIf you can, tell people you've been wanting to get into it for years and then give him some real competition in the field, something humorous but that shows you're not just 'following ' him around.", "Yeah I do think it is mostly the way the questions are being asked/how the comments are being made.

I thought too that it may be just awkward small talk, but I personally would never feel comfortable bringing somebody else into an individual's own choices or accomplishments.

That's okay, we all have things that get our back-up it's how we manage the defensive impulse that matters.\n\nYou mentioned you would never feel comfortable bringing others into somebody else's choices or accomplishments. Which is fine but socially it's a very accepted and even encouraged practice. Pretty much anyone being acknowledged for anything starts off their acceptance speech by thanking all the ppl who inspired, encouraged or assisted them on that path. Likewise, interviewers often ask who inspired a person or who supported them. This question isn't asked to diminish the interviewees work, passion or commitment but rather to draw out the person's story and show interest in the journey.\n\nI really don't think anyone was in any way looking to diminish your achievement or credit your partner. It sounds like they were just trying to be nice, show interest and maybe draw out your story. You may find that if you lower your defences a bit and respond with a simple \"actually, this is something I've been working towards for a long time, well before BF, but I'm so glad he shares my passion\" that you get to have meaningful conversations about what drew you to the industry. Right now I doubt anyone you snapped at will show interest in what your doing for some time.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Just say that he is copying you and not the other way around.", "NTA, you are your own person with your own career.

You're being treated as your fiance's lesser.\n\nIt's condescending. Your fiance should have put a stop to it the moment he knew it was an issue. \n\nThere might be two ways of using language to address this.\n\nThe first is the one you use to stamp out arguments without directly addressing it. It's the language of slightly subtle situational passive aggression, so you don't have to, but they're calling you the issue when you're mad about it. I've had to use it on some extended family for the same reason. If he's not taking you seriously, your fiance might learn his lesson of hears you speak about it like you've been spoken to about it.\n\nYou can also change the wording to however you like. The point is the message.\n\nYou'd need to use gentle humor to get this across. Everytime someone asks, preface the situation with you're not doing this because of your husband. You're only saying this because that's what people seem to think at the start. \n\nAnd if they ask why, say that you don't entirely know.\n\nThis shuts people up about it because their minds wander and they realize how shameful they might've acted towards you. I used this with older female family members because the unsaid reasons were them being cruel or misogyny.\n\nThe second application is the normal one. Just say that you're resuming your studies because Covid delayed them. The timeline is close enough and no one questions Covid.

People used to constantly assume that when he said \"we're both engineers\" somehow it meant that I had to be a SAHM and have no degree or was somehow trying to borrow his achievements or that he pushed me into the field somehow.\n\nIt's insulting.  We've started answering that he works for X company and I work at Y company. We still get comments, but I just respond that I met my spouse while we were in school.\n\nYeah, you'll get better responses if you can keep it light and friendly as you correct people who assume you're an extension of your partner's achievements, but I don't think you're TA for pushing back against people crediting your partner for your hard work.", "I may be down voted to all oblivion, but soft YTA.\n\nI struggled tremendously with my self-worth for a time. I won't bore you with the details, but it boiled down to being a college dropout and my folks saying, \"here, call these people if you want to work\" because they knew what industry I wanted to pursue and had contacts who could help.\n\nI resisted HARD for a while, until I got a job on my own merits outside the industry and had the \"ah-hah\" moment that their help/encouragement didn't have any strings attached and me making those phone calls wasn't piggy-backing. (Also I loathed that temp job, lol) I was ride or die on my own terms. They just provided the numbers to call.\n\nI got off easy-ish since my name isn't necessarily associated with either of my parents, so I was able to \"fly under the radar\" as it were and build my own name for myself. And then the calls kept coming. I wasn't saying, \"XYZ gave me your number, and I'd like to join your crew\" anymore. It was them saying, \"hey skandranon, we heard good things about you and would like to hire you for ABC job.\" The difference in confidence was HUGE.\n\nAll this to say, needing to be seen for your own merits is entirely understandable, and it is easy to be blinded by your own personal failures in the face of a genuine question. It sounds as though your fianc\u00e9's relatives were looking for a way to connect with you outside of their own ken, and so resorted to associating the two of you as a way to play connect the dots. When you aren't so established in your career and have had setbacks already, it can definitely feel like an attack even if it wasn't meant as such. \n\nI do think, though, that as time both distances you from that previous version of yourself and establishes you more in your current trajectory, you'll find the curiosity is turned more toward *your* latest project and accomplishments, especially as they deviate from your partner's. That is absolutely the path of optimism, but from one woman in a male-dominated industry to another, *you got this*.", "\"I learned some of this before I ever met him.

I think many people just have an old-school mentality when it comes to job roles and gender. Growing up and into my early 20s, it was normally questioned by people if anybody else influenced my future decision and that people would give me a bit of a \"talk\" about how I should find my \"own thing\". Which always felt a bit condescending.\n\nI have no doubt that once I finish my degree I may still get questions or comments about being in the same industry as my partner. But I think it will matter much less to me once I'm actually in the industry.", "Congrats on creating your own path. Not that there is anything wrong with falling back on the connections that may already exist, but I can understand wanting to make a name for yourself instead of being known as  \"____'s family member or friend\" or whatever.\n\nFocusing on making a name for myself is the goal too. I appreciate your comment and perspective.", "I experience the questions/comments from mostly females too. Males normally don't question it and are are usually the ones who say \"that's a great career choice because you'll always have a job due to the growth of the industry\" and females are the ones that associate my choice with my fiance or try to encourage that I choose something that I want to do (even though it is clearly what I want to do if I've chosen this). It is a bit devistating that some women aren't on board with encouraging other women to enter male dominated industries, but there isn't much I can do about it except just succeeding at my own career and proving others wrong.", "I had no idea there was a difference in the spelling. I learnt something new today.", "The *really* fun and unexpected part of that is when introductions go around and the coworkers who travel in Venn diagram-type circles with you and yours say to your partner, \"oh you must be OP's partner, she speaks so highly of you!\"\n\nThe first time that happened to my mom she told me her hackles immediately went up: \"I've been in this industry for 30 years and NOW I'm known as skandranon's MOM?\" And then she realized what that meant for her daughter (me); that I'd made a name for myself entirely outside of her, and it was only those who'd had interactions with the both of us that would make the connection. Now she makes a game of it and is proud as punch whenever it happens.\n\nI hope the same for you - that through your accomplishments you're able to both turn those initial comments on their head, and more importantly laugh about them later. Best of luck to you!", "It's definitely ridiculous. I don't know what part of IT you're studying, but I know things like programming or hardware are something that can go way beyond the college class/normal study time. You're learning a language that can be used for necessary programming with hardware and software that can leave you behind in a few years if you don't keep up with it. Some places require basic certification in a specific area or they won't even think of hiring you. ETC\n\nIt's very much a lifestyle takeover. Minimizing that is insulting.", "Or \u201cour love for IT was one of the things that bought us together.

Among couples, it's more unusual than not to have the same interests and education - so it's something that would be commented upon.\n\nI think you need to let up on his family and not see bad things where they don't exist.", "I guess I won't know if it is truly misogyny until I finish my degree and fully commence my own career. If people still question if I'm in the industry because he is and he doesn't get asked the same questions about his career, then I can definitely make that assumption.", "I think the issue is you didn\u2019t use your words. When they ask next time just say \u201cactually I started studying IT x years ago but kept having to stop due to life obstacles. But now I\u2019m finally back on the course I set for myself years before I met fianc\u00e9, so I\u2019m super happy to finally be getting closer to my dream.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s really all that\u2019s needed. Then they\u2019ll know this was your dream for a long time and any subsequent questions will prob be about you and your journey. \n\nGood luck.", "I for one think NTA . \nYou already answered before that it is your decision and your path .they are ah for keep lumping you with your fiance and implying it his merit alone.\n\nTell you fiance HE needs to have a chat with his family so that they can start acting and treating you like your own person with a brain and your own aspirations.\nIf he doesn't it's on him and them how you react to the next unrespectful situation", "You may have to keep repeating it until it sinks in.

The content I'm learning is definitely challenging and I don't think just anybody is cut out for it (just as I would find certain things difficult that some others wouldn't). As you mentioned, I will constantly need to be learning new and updated skills once I am in my career, even after getting the initial college degree. Speaking of my fiance working in the industry, throughout most of his career so far he has worked on certifications outside of his work hours. It does very much require a lot of work and updating your knowledge & skills. You have to be passionate about the field. I think a lot of people just don't understand the industry or technology in general, and the field was quite stereotyped for a long time (geeky males with a lack of social skills, or something along those lines)."]}
