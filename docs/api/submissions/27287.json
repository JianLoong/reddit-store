He only sees them once or twice a week on his days off. Its because of his work schedule that he can\u2019t see them often. When they come over they usually stay for a short time, eat dinner or lunch, and talk with their dad. Sometimes they go out for a couple of hours\n\nThe problem is that they have no respect for me, my kids, and 16F constantly steals from our home.\n\nI don\u2019t mind if they just didn\u2019t want a relationship with me. But they constantly disrespect me, and insult me when I enter the room. They have insulted me for not working (i have a job but just recently had a baby), and make \u2018jokes\u2019 how i\u2019m using their dad for money (I make more money him). I have two sons from a previous relationship (7M, and 9M) Which they insult because they think my sons are too dumb to understand what they are saying. Yet they understand clearly and are hurt by it.\nI have talked to my husband about this, and he says its all just jokes, and that he acted like that to his siblings. I have talked to them about it and they told their mom who argued with my husband about it.\n\n16F also steals, she\u2019ll say she\u2019s going to the bathroom and then enter the bedroom and take some cash. I have caught her doing this multiple times. My husband will make her give it back then give her money from his own wallet. When I try to talk to her about it she tells her mom, who again argued with my husband. We have gotten locks for our rooms but she has just stolen other stuff instead.\n\nMy kids avoid going to the kitchen or living room when the girls are over, and i\u2019m tired of being worried that something is missing. I told my husband that he could spend time with the girls outside the house, and if he brought them over i\u2019d just take the kids and leave until they\u2019re gone.\n\nMy husband called me childish, and my mom said its unfair to make him do that for me.

This does more harm than good because these kids grow up with no boundaries. \n\nThe girls are out of control. They are way too old to be acting like this.

He is not willing to address it.  The kids are what they are.  You can't control them or change them.  You can expect your husband to protect you from them.\n\nI would usually say that it's inappropriate to ever bar one spouse's kids from the house, but these kids are stealing things and openly disrespecting you.  The 19-year-old is an adult so your husband is not responsible for her.  In this situation, I would talk to your husband and ask him to meet them outside the house until he can figure out how you and your belongings can be safe and treated respectfully in your own home.

I had the same situation in my second marriage except we had primary residence of all our children.  I tried talking calmly to them, then my husband.  When his 12 year old called my 4 year old a b!tch I was done.  I told my husband if it was okay for my children to be abused then his children would also suffer.  I told my 8 and 4 year old there were no longer any rules.  Besides name calling his children would go through my childrens things and destroy them.  The 12 year old liked to poke, pull hair, pinch and turn off tv while my children were gaming.  Cue that night.  My children were playing video games in the living room (he had his own console in his room).  He sat just behind but between them and started the touching so they would lose the game.  When they died on the game both turned, pushed him over on his back and started pulling his hair. He was suddenly in tears.  My husband objected and I reminded him he had agreed to no more rules.  When we sat down to eat my 8 year old said, \"fatso, pass the bread\".  Once again my husband became upset but if my 4 year old can be called a b!tch he can be fatso.  Then when his 12 year old was leaving the house with friends my 4 year old called out the window, \" Fat A$$, I'm gonna play your games while your gone.\". He ran back into the house and cried.  My husband looked at me in shock.  How could my children be so mean.  Well your son taught them.  Within an hour we had all agreed to be better.  When the older child came home she was relieved that we were setting the rules for everyone.

He only sees them once or twice a week on his days off. Its because of his work schedule that he can\u2019t see them often. When they come over they usually stay for a short time, eat dinner or lunch, and talk with their dad. Sometimes they go out for a couple of hours\n\nThe problem is that they have no respect for me, my kids, and 16F constantly steals from our home.\n\nI don\u2019t mind if they just didn\u2019t want a relationship with me. But they constantly disrespect me, and insult me when I enter the room. They have insulted me for not working (i have a job but just recently had a baby), and make \u2018jokes\u2019 how i\u2019m using their dad for money (I make more money him). I have two sons from a previous relationship (7M, and 9M) Which they insult because they think my sons are too dumb to understand what they are saying. Yet they understand clearly and are hurt by it.\nI have talked to my husband about this, and he says its all just jokes, and that he acted like that to his siblings. I have talked to them about it and they told their mom who argued with my husband about it.\n\n16F also steals, she\u2019ll say she\u2019s going to the bathroom and then enter the bedroom and take some cash. I have caught her doing this multiple times. My husband will make her give it back then give her money from his own wallet. When I try to talk to her about it she tells her mom, who again argued with my husband. We have gotten locks for our rooms but she has just stolen other stuff instead.\n\nMy kids avoid going to the kitchen or living room when the girls are over, and i\u2019m tired of being worried that something is missing. I told my husband that he could spend time with the girls outside the house, and if he brought them over i\u2019d just take the kids and leave until they\u2019re gone.\n\nMy husband called me childish, and my mom said its unfair to make him do that for me.
