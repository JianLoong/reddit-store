Some relevant context, when we first met she had a little extra weight on her, but I didn\u2019t ever really notice it and I found her very attractive. Fast forward to around 2 years ago, she got serious about getting into better shape and made significant changes to her lifestyle, particularly diet. The weight came off really quickly and in total she\u2019s lost about 25 pounds. She\u2019s 5\u20194\u201d and now weighs around 123 pounds, and has been this stable weight for about 6 months. I\u2019ve been supportive the whole time.\n\nWhile that\u2019s all great, since she first started losing weight she\u2019s expressed to me that\u2019s she\u2019s now terrified of gaining weight again and being \u201cfat\u201d, even though I\u2019ve told her that I never thought she was fat before and definitely isn\u2019t now. She keeps pretty close tabs on calories and gets very stressed out if she feels she\u2019s eaten too much throughout the day. I know it isn\u2019t a great state of mind, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious because it doesn\u2019t really affect her functioning in life. \n\nNow for the current situation. She\u2019s been very frustrated about the little bit of \u201cpouch\u201d she has on her stomach, that she doesn\u2019t understand why it hasn\u2019t gone away. We work out together every other day, and she\u2019s told me that she tries to eat 1200 calories a day or less to try and lose the last bit of fat and get a flatter stomach. A couple days ago she told me that she\u2019s been reading and thinks she\u2019s probably actually been eating too little and is going to now try to eat 1400 calories per day to boost her metabolism or something like that. I said cool. Yesterday morning we both had the day off, and for a late breakfast / early lunch she ate avocado toast, 2 eggs, and an orange. About an hour later she said she was hungry and had a small bowl of frozen veggies. It was kinda surprising to see her eat so much so I just made the observation \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of food.\u201d She gave me an upset look and said she\u2019s hungry, to which I replied \u201cI\u2019m not hungry and I\u2019ve only eaten a hotdog today\u201d (which was true). \n\nI didn\u2019t say that to be a jerk, I just kinda didn\u2019t understand how she could\u2019ve been hungry when I wasn\u2019t hungry and I\u2019m 6\u2019 185 pounds. It just kinda caught me off guard, that was all, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Anyways, she got kinda sad and said ok, that she wouldn\u2019t eat anything else until dinner. We\u2019ve both kinda been avoiding each other since then, and I can definitely tell she feels hurt.\n\nPersonally, I think she\u2019s being too sensitive.

She in fact, did not eat a lot of food. Even if she had, there was no need for you to comment on it.\n\n Also If the \"pooch\" she's worried about is midline and in the lower part of her abdomen, it is probably her uterus.

Some relevant context, when we first met she had a little extra weight on her, but I didn\u2019t ever really notice it and I found her very attractive. Fast forward to around 2 years ago, she got serious about getting into better shape and made significant changes to her lifestyle, particularly diet. The weight came off really quickly and in total she\u2019s lost about 25 pounds. She\u2019s 5\u20194\u201d and now weighs around 123 pounds, and has been this stable weight for about 6 months. I\u2019ve been supportive the whole time.\n\nWhile that\u2019s all great, since she first started losing weight she\u2019s expressed to me that\u2019s she\u2019s now terrified of gaining weight again and being \u201cfat\u201d, even though I\u2019ve told her that I never thought she was fat before and definitely isn\u2019t now. She keeps pretty close tabs on calories and gets very stressed out if she feels she\u2019s eaten too much throughout the day. I know it isn\u2019t a great state of mind, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious because it doesn\u2019t really affect her functioning in life. \n\nNow for the current situation. She\u2019s been very frustrated about the little bit of \u201cpouch\u201d she has on her stomach, that she doesn\u2019t understand why it hasn\u2019t gone away. We work out together every other day, and she\u2019s told me that she tries to eat 1200 calories a day or less to try and lose the last bit of fat and get a flatter stomach. A couple days ago she told me that she\u2019s been reading and thinks she\u2019s probably actually been eating too little and is going to now try to eat 1400 calories per day to boost her metabolism or something like that. I said cool. Yesterday morning we both had the day off, and for a late breakfast / early lunch she ate avocado toast, 2 eggs, and an orange. About an hour later she said she was hungry and had a small bowl of frozen veggies. It was kinda surprising to see her eat so much so I just made the observation \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of food.\u201d She gave me an upset look and said she\u2019s hungry, to which I replied \u201cI\u2019m not hungry and I\u2019ve only eaten a hotdog today\u201d (which was true). \n\nI didn\u2019t say that to be a jerk, I just kinda didn\u2019t understand how she could\u2019ve been hungry when I wasn\u2019t hungry and I\u2019m 6\u2019 185 pounds. It just kinda caught me off guard, that was all, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Anyways, she got kinda sad and said ok, that she wouldn\u2019t eat anything else until dinner.

It\u2019s so easy to visualize. 6 of something big is so much easier than 200 of something small.  \n\nIf you\u2019re raised in pure metric you definitely don\u2019t need it because you have a much better and more flexible grasp on just what 180cms is. You have a frame of reference for probably any number of cms I can throw at you. I can\u2019t picture it at all. I have to think\u2026 that\u2019s 1.8 meters, a meter is about 3 feet, so that\u2019s like\u2026 almost 6 feet?\n\nAnyway, sorry for the tangent. It\u2019s such a weird phenomenon to me, to be in a metric country yet we\u2019re still so reliant on imperial.", "There are ways to make this joke funny, this is not it.", "I think the metric system makes a lot more sense but when that\u2019s what our govt has us use it\u2019s pointless to blame individual people, it\u2019s forced on us.", "BTW, 55 Kgs (I had to calculate it, thank you so much) is perfect for a 162 cms tall girl, the standard formula to calculate the ideal weight in kgs for women is their height in centimeters -105, so 57 kilos would be perfect for her, and she is below that", ">And I won\u2019t make anymore comments on her eating, that was an AH move of me.\n\nI'm glad you get this but I want to add -- beyond whether or not YTA, it's dangerous to support her in eating less than she is. She's already disordered and she probably will be until she makes peace with the fact that women often have a body with \"pouch\" because that's how our bodies *are*. \n\nYou aren't the kind of AH who wants her to be rail thin and would leave her otherwise, but I think you might want to seriously look at how much anxiety she has about food and her body. You aren't the cause of it, but if you want her to be healthy, you can underline it by being supportive of her eating when she's hungry (a very smart thing to do), exploring things like intuitive eating, and continuing to appreciate her body as it is and as it was.", "She needs to see a registered dietitian, not a nutritionist. Please help her find an RD.", ">I can see how it was an extra AH thing when what she was eating was healthy\n\n\nIf she'd been eating a bowl of fudge, you still should have kept your mouth shut. She can figure it out for herself without pointless commentary.", "Honestly. It\u2019s comments like this from an old boyfriend that made me come very close to having an eating disorder. Thankfully I had flatmates (who hated him for other reasons) who kept an eye on my and I was able to get back on track and eat healthier. \n\nPlease don\u2019t make comments like this. It\u2019s really not helpful and can have the opposite effect.", "A BOWL OF FROZEN VEGETABLES! \n\nI'm agape. Never in a million years did I think that was where this post was going to end up.", "I\u2019m legitimately concerned for OP\u2019s girlfriend and her food/body relationship based on his description of how she stresses over calories and fears weight gain.\nI\u2019m glad she decided she should stop restricting herself to 1200 calories. I\u2019m also glad that when she\u2019s hungry after a meal, she eats something nutritious.", "Hey! I can eat hotdogs for breakfast and certainly wouldn\u2019t harp on someone for eating vegetables! There\u2019s no good excuse for some people.", "Same.  It's these comments that get stuck in your head and play on repeat while you're puking your brains out.", "Thank you for your calm and rational responses to the judgments", "Not only AH but ignorant and judgmental. \n\nWhen she began her process of losing weight she should have been next to a specialist and check with a specialist from time to time if she feels she needs it, now her strugglings with body image and food maybe should be checked with a mental health specialist (specialist in ED).\n\nYou say you support her but... idk OP, you reproached her when she was eating frozen veggies, your reproach make it sound like she was wrong or there is something wrong with her being hungry and eating a healthy snack.\n\nYTA.", "Also keep in mind that women\u2019s hunger can vary with their menstrual cycle because of hormonal changes, and different foods keep you feeling full at different rates. There is a lot if complexity when it comes to eating, so it really is an individual game. I\u2019m also going to jump on the dietitian, not a nutritionist recommendation, they have different requirements.", "She may have interpreted that as \"You're eating more than ME, a bigger person\" and seen it as a criticism. I don't think that's what you meant, but it could be interpreted that way.", "It's good that you realized it was unfair. \n\nYou ate something that is more satiating. Hot dogs and other processed foods make you feel more satisfied but that doesn't mean they are healthier. \n\nAlso, men's weightloss and women's weightloss are worlds apart.\n\n Did you know that based on her menstrual cycle, her ability to lose weight changes with the hormones produced during each week of the cycle? There are things that affect women's weightloss more than you know. \n\nIf you don't feel like reading medical journals on the topic, James Smith PT does a crash course on how those hormones affect weightloss in a woman.", "Before you ever fall into a trap of intentions versus actions make sure you understand that in situations like this the intention means nothing. This will serve well throughout life especially being a good partner, friends, etc. You seem like you\u2019re aware that YTA - so better to learn this now rather than later - good luck.", "Eh, my brother and I absolutely loved snacking on semi-frozen peas as a kid. They have a nice crunch.", "Agreed completely, no wonder she lost the weight so fast. I can\u2019t imagine how tired she must feel.", "\u201cI\u2019ve never told her she needs to lose weight\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you over eating\u201d \n\nYou can\u2019t be serious right now\n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I wasn\u2019t saying that you said those things, the reason I reiterate those things is because they are concerning- and she may need help from a therapist or nutritionalist to really do some shadow work on these problems. Wishing her the best.\n\nMy point also being that you have typed those things, you are aware that this is how she feels, and the concerns she has. You even mention that her worries regarding eating cause her a lot of distress.\nAnd still made the comment you did.\nThat\u2019s why I chose YTA.\nIt wasn\u2019t like she was eating ice cream sandwiches after a double bacon cheeseburger with fries,\nit was a snack of veggies after a healthy brunch.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine you were raised that this was an okay comment to make to anyone, much less someone you love who has disordered thoughts surrounding weight gain and eating, yknow?\n\nI understand you were trying to be supportive but this was not the way to do it. This only amplified her worries.", "Ok, fair.", "There is no \"ideal weight\" for women. Bodies are different, builds are different, what people find beautiful is different.", "Thank you for the advice. I\u2019ll make it a point to support her desire to start eating more, and I\u2019ll continue to tell her she\u2019s beautiful the way she is, because she is.", "Thank you, I don\u2019t know much about this stuff so I\u2019ll do some research and help her look for one.", "All that \u2018concern\u2019 in the post - for what?

I tried it a few times - it was pretty good.", "Even if it was an ice cream sammy after a cheeseburger and fries - is it still okay to make these comments?", "I understand your point, I definitely needed to be more aware of the impact my comment would have on her.", "You\u2019re still getting downvoted but you\u2019re both living in a world that sets you up to have baggage around food and weight. You\u2019re clearly a good guy overall. This just wasn\u2019t your best work \ud83d\ude09", "Do NOT suggest one or do research for her unless she approaches you several times.
