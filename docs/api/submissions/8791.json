Some relevant context, when we first met she had a little extra weight on her, but I didn\u2019t ever really notice it and I found her very attractive. Fast forward to around 2 years ago, she got serious about getting into better shape and made significant changes to her lifestyle, particularly diet. The weight came off really quickly and in total she\u2019s lost about 25 pounds. She\u2019s 5\u20194\u201d and now weighs around 123 pounds, and has been this stable weight for about 6 months. I\u2019ve been supportive the whole time.\n\nWhile that\u2019s all great, since she first started losing weight she\u2019s expressed to me that\u2019s she\u2019s now terrified of gaining weight again and being \u201cfat\u201d, even though I\u2019ve told her that I never thought she was fat before and definitely isn\u2019t now. She keeps pretty close tabs on calories and gets very stressed out if she feels she\u2019s eaten too much throughout the day. I know it isn\u2019t a great state of mind, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious because it doesn\u2019t really affect her functioning in life. \n\nNow for the current situation. She\u2019s been very frustrated about the little bit of \u201cpouch\u201d she has on her stomach, that she doesn\u2019t understand why it hasn\u2019t gone away. We work out together every other day, and she\u2019s told me that she tries to eat 1200 calories a day or less to try and lose the last bit of fat and get a flatter stomach. A couple days ago she told me that she\u2019s been reading and thinks she\u2019s probably actually been eating too little and is going to now try to eat 1400 calories per day to boost her metabolism or something like that. I said cool. Yesterday morning we both had the day off, and for a late breakfast / early lunch she ate avocado toast, 2 eggs, and an orange. About an hour later she said she was hungry and had a small bowl of frozen veggies. It was kinda surprising to see her eat so much so I just made the observation \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of food.\u201d She gave me an upset look and said she\u2019s hungry, to which I replied \u201cI\u2019m not hungry and I\u2019ve only eaten a hotdog today\u201d (which was true). \n\nI didn\u2019t say that to be a jerk, I just kinda didn\u2019t understand how she could\u2019ve been hungry when I wasn\u2019t hungry and I\u2019m 6\u2019 185 pounds. It just kinda caught me off guard, that was all, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Anyways, she got kinda sad and said ok, that she wouldn\u2019t eat anything else until dinner. We\u2019ve both kinda been avoiding each other since then, and I can definitely tell she feels hurt.\n\nPersonally, I think she\u2019s being too sensitive.

She in fact, did not eat a lot of food. Even if she had, there was no need for you to comment on it.\n\nAlso If the \"pooch\" she's worried about is midline and in the lower part of her abdomen, it is probably her uterus.

Some relevant context, when we first met she had a little extra weight on her, but I didn\u2019t ever really notice it and I found her very attractive. Fast forward to around 2 years ago, she got serious about getting into better shape and made significant changes to her lifestyle, particularly diet. The weight came off really quickly and in total she\u2019s lost about 25 pounds. She\u2019s 5\u20194\u201d and now weighs around 123 pounds, and has been this stable weight for about 6 months. I\u2019ve been supportive the whole time.\n\nWhile that\u2019s all great, since she first started losing weight she\u2019s expressed to me that\u2019s she\u2019s now terrified of gaining weight again and being \u201cfat\u201d, even though I\u2019ve told her that I never thought she was fat before and definitely isn\u2019t now. She keeps pretty close tabs on calories and gets very stressed out if she feels she\u2019s eaten too much throughout the day. I know it isn\u2019t a great state of mind, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious because it doesn\u2019t really affect her functioning in life. \n\nNow for the current situation. She\u2019s been very frustrated about the little bit of \u201cpouch\u201d she has on her stomach, that she doesn\u2019t understand why it hasn\u2019t gone away. We work out together every other day, and she\u2019s told me that she tries to eat 1200 calories a day or less to try and lose the last bit of fat and get a flatter stomach. A couple days ago she told me that she\u2019s been reading and thinks she\u2019s probably actually been eating too little and is going to now try to eat 1400 calories per day to boost her metabolism or something like that. I said cool. Yesterday morning we both had the day off, and for a late breakfast / early lunch she ate avocado toast, 2 eggs, and an orange. About an hour later she said she was hungry and had a small bowl of frozen veggies. It was kinda surprising to see her eat so much so I just made the observation \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of food.\u201d She gave me an upset look and said she\u2019s hungry, to which I replied \u201cI\u2019m not hungry and I\u2019ve only eaten a hotdog today\u201d (which was true). \n\nI didn\u2019t say that to be a jerk, I just kinda didn\u2019t understand how she could\u2019ve been hungry when I wasn\u2019t hungry and I\u2019m 6\u2019 185 pounds. It just kinda caught me off guard, that was all, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Anyways, she got kinda sad and said ok, that she wouldn\u2019t eat anything else until dinner. We\u2019ve both kinda been avoiding each other since then, and I can definitely tell she feels hurt.\n\nPersonally, I think she\u2019s being too sensitive.
