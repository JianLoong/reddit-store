Despite having mixed feelings since *Jessica* has a history of causing trouble, I congratulated them.   \n\n\nThe news came coincidentally right when I was preparing to propose to my GF I'd be flying back to shortly after. We had been entertaining the idea of getting married for a while at that point especially since the 2,5 years of forced seperation during covid had been a nightmare none of us wanted to repeat. Considering our different nationalities, getting married was necessary to get a visa to live together. Essentially all our future plans depended on it.   \nI proposed in late March and we started researching how long everything would take. The answer: **LONG.** So our choice was simple: Get married soon. Best before september even. Only on paper. No big ceremony/party until we live together.  \nKnowing that Jessica is very emotional I expected that it would cause stress, so I sat them down, explained the situation, telling them that I really hope they understand. While my brother nodded in approval, Jessica remained silent. That was until she got home and wrote me a huge text about how *they* (meaning herself - a reoccuring theme) would feel like *something was being stolen from them* if they weren't marrying 1st and that we'd have to delay our plans until after September.   \n\n\nI didnt tell my fiance about this right away to spare her the stress but I needed to process what happened so I talked to my mom, who gathered us together in an attempt to settle the dispute. Jessica stormed out of the room crying that day. My brother then nicely asked us to leave, knowing that she'd stay in her room.  \n\n\nFast forward 6 weeks. I had moved on from the incident and was ready to forget, when Jessica wrote me another long text, breaking her silence, calling me rude & \"mama's lil boy\", saying I needed to give her special treatment because of her childhood trauma and that I hurt her, indirectly threatening a long family feud if I wouldn't apologize and delay the wedding.   \n\n\nBecause it wasn't the 1st time she pressured me to get what she wanted & I made my point, I didn't reply, trying to talk to my brother instead which took another week because Jessica wouldn't let him. I then told him that I wasn't going to change my plans, that I found her message absurd & that she most certainly wasn't getting an apology.   \n\n\nOver the next 2 months Jessica would send a text every 1-2 weeks, getting more aggressive, blocking me despite me literally saying nothing, then unblocking me again to write more, texting my mom and my fiance about me (the latter doesn't even have contact with Jessica), sending my bro as messenger to put even more pressure on me. I eventually had enough and blocked her for good.", "created_utc": 1696938486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174j6dh/aita_for_not_delaying_my_wedding_so_my_sister_in/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What took you so long to block her? After the first text she would\u2019ve gotten blocked because instead being an adult and telling you to your face how she felt she waited until later in a text to do so. Don\u2019t even worry about going to the wedding I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be your brother\u2019s only wedding. NTA", "NTA. Just live your life. Maybe your brother can see that he's about to marry a spoiled baby and change his mind. Your marriage has nothing to do with her. You aren't hurting her or taking anything away from her. You are doing a quick, legal ceremony.", "NTA some people have long engagements and plan weddings far in advance, other people for various reasons get the wedding over with sooner. I don't see what is wrong with you getting engaged and married within the time that they're engaged. It seems such a weird thing to get upset about.", "Info:\n\nAs it\u2019s now October has the wedding now taken place?", "Oh dear god, I didn\u2019t even read  your whole post. \n\nGo get married on paper, OP, and start your life. You don\u2019t even have to tell your family exactly when the papers are signed and it is done, since it might be so upsetting. I roll my eyes. \n\nThis has nothing to do with *Jessica*. Jessica can do her own thing and she can have her protected meltdown without you being involved.

You\u2019re not even having a wedding, it\u2019s just an official marriage.", "NTA,\n\nJessica sounds like she has BPD and I feel sorry for your brother if he ever marries her. \n\nAs for the continuing to send you and your family nasty messages, I'd fire off a 1 paragraph message that any future messages will be considered as harassment and you'll take them to the police.\n\nI'd also send copies to your brother. He probably doesn't know what she's doing. Make it clear to your brother that you love him and will always have his back. He will need to know that one day when he finally sees through her and she directs that rage at him.\n\nJust press on with your plans and don't let Jessica know anything about your wedding. I wouldn't put it past her to do something petty to try and ruin it. \n\nI wish you both the very best for the future and congratulations on your engagement.", "NTA, block her permanently! You are not even going for a big wedding, just getting the paperwork so you can live your life. What does it matter the order that people get married. She is going to be a thorn in your side the whole time she is in the family.", "NTA. I have no tolerance for people like Jessica. Heck, it used to be common for people in a family to get married on the same day so they didn\u2019t have to spend money on two receptions and guests didn\u2019t have to travel twice. You aren\u2019t getting married at her. You are just living your life.
