That finally happened one long weekend. P had decided to head back home, but had left his door open. K walked past P\u2019s room and saw a 750ml bottle of vodka sitting out on P\u2019s desk.\n\nSo I reported him.

And then you\u2019re associated with him when he goes out and is a mess everywhere", "[removed]", "All it takes to be an alcoholic is for alcohol to be negatively effecting your life. \n\nAs a chip carrying friend of Bill, gatekeeping alcoholism helps nobody.", "TLDR: NTA, but I would've tried a few other solutions first.\n\n\r  \nAs someone who worked in Housing & ResLife for a few years (and someone who lived on campus as a college student), I would've recommended having addressed P first about the food, but then if issues persisted, you should've gone to your resident assistant (or the equivalent) for a moderated facilitation. Usually this involves rehashing any roommate contracts or ground rules for living with each other with a trained, unbiased party to help make sure everyone is heard.\n\n\r  \nAs for the drinking and reporting, I'll come at this both from a professional standpoint and student standpoint.\n\n\r  \nAs a student, I understand being wary of confrontation and finding the nerve to do something when P wasn't there. I also understand the hesitation on reporting him and causing him to get in trouble and also of potentially causing an uncomfortable living situation or a strain on your relationships, not just with P, but with K&W too. I was also the kind of person who would've just sucked it up and not said anything when I was in college--confrontation was a big no-no for me. But, also as a student, I think you were right to do something, especially since you seemed to be the only one to want to do ANYTHING.\n\n\r  \nAs a Housing & ResLife professional, you DEFINITELY did the right thing, and for many reasons! His heavy drinking and keeping alcohol in his dorm had the potential to negatively affect everyone in the suite. While you, K, and P are of legal drinking age, W is underage, and that alone makes this situation SO much more serious. Not only is that a violation of campus policy\u2014that's illegal. (This is also assuming you're from America\u2014your language suggests that, but I may be wrong.) If there was an inspection or someone else outside your suite reported you, you would all be fined for having alcohol, W could be charged for MIP, and you, K, and P could be charged with distribution to a minor. (I have dealt with this EXACT situation, and all four students got charged both by the school and the state.) Even if W wasn't underaged, if school authorities aren't able to tell who the alcohol belongs to, all members in the suite get charged until someone comes forward and takes the fall.\n\n\r  \nAnd furthermore, P's sudden binge-drinking could also be a sign of mental health struggles and the appropriate people should be made aware of this\u2014your school probably has a CARE/Advocacy team and trained counselors who would be able to help him, and the only way they could know about that is by people who know him reporting this change in behavior. \r  \n\r  \nRegardless, it may feel shitty to \"snitch\", but you held out for a long time under stressful circumstances, and you need to take care of yourself. You did the right thing, and you're Not The Asshole.", "NTA. If someone is doing something that won't hurt anyone else, then it's more of a grey area. Do you help them help themselves or leave it alone?\n\nBut in this case, you all would have been fined. P doesn't get to be irresponsible and reckless with others' finances and housing.", "NTA.  P knew the rules and he obviously doesn't care if he's using the rest of you.  Get rid of this guy.", "NTA\n\nQuite apart from being a jerk, this guy may have or be developing a serious problem with alcohol and actually need a wake up call or some help, which feasible reporting him would bring.\n\nHim not paying for groceries is not ok and the three of you need to confront him and ask.", "[removed]", "ESH seems like he was going through a tough time, I do feel like you were glad to have something to report him for, but hopefully he gets the help he needs.\n\nI defo wouldn\u2019t wanna be friends with someone like you though based off your post doesn\u2019t seems like you tremors to talk to him much get to the heart of the issue.", "No body likes a grass", "I didn\u2019t include it in the post but we did mention it to him.

Feels so good to judge this college student for drinking alcohol, doesn't it? Just bathe in the self righteousness and screw him for not listening to OP's version of reason, even though OP admits that they are afraid of confrontation. That's what's wrong with passive people. They'd rather tattle and manipulate the authorities into solving their problems than have an uncomfortable conversation, and once the decision to involve the authorities is made then the OP has an overwhelming incentive to make the room mate out to be as bad as possible. \n\nI don't believe for one moment that the OP's description of the room mate's behavior was fairly described, so I voted the way I voted, without looking to the group to tell me what to think. I think people like the OP are assholes for not making an honest effort to solve their interpersonal conflicts with their words and just take the coward's way out when they tattle."]}
