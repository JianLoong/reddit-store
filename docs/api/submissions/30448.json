Basically if paraphernalia is found in our doom or your on campus apartment, everyone will receive a pretty steep fine and then have to go to a 2 hour \u201cwhy we don\u2019t do drugs\u201d diet-AA type counseling class. But if someone reports the paraphernalia the punishment only comes down on the owner of the paraphernalia.\n\n\nStory: I didn\u2019t know P before he moved in with us at the start of the semester. He was friends with W and W though he would be a good fourth roommate. P moved in and for the first week seemed like an ok guy. Then the problems began. Original we were going to buy groceries as an apartment and then split the bill four ways. So we all load up and go to the store. After we purchase the groceries P says that he\u2019s not gonna pay his 1/4 and never intended to. This really makes K and I upset cus we ended up paying his part and we are broke college students. \nLater that week P proceeded to eat a large amount of the food that he didn\u2019t pay for. I have other stories that I can add to this but simply he is a had person to live with and is very disrespectful of our things.\n\nThen the drinking starts. Three times at least in the first month of him living with us, P was so drunk he could barely stand up. This would happen semi regularly. Apparently he\u2019d buy whatever was the cheapest and the strongest to try and get drunk as quickly as possible. \n\nP getting that drunk had happened enough times that I told K and W that if I saw evidence of alcohol in the apartment I\u2019d report him to our Residence Director. That finally happened one long weekend. P had decided to head back home, but had left his door open. K walked past P\u2019s room and saw a 750ml bottle of vodka sitting out on P\u2019s desk.\n\nSo I reported him. I am not a very confrontational person irl and I kinda feel bad that he had to receive the punishment from the school for it\n\nTLDR: roommate violated my campus alcohol policy many times and I finally reported him", "created_utc": 1699281153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p41mf/aita_for_snitching_on_my_roommate/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
