My boyfriend chose to go to one of his friends parties instead. Later that night she invited her twin cousins, one of them i used to talk to in middle school. Yes middle school. Me and him have no close relationship at all after that, we are still friends but he has a girlfriend and i have a boyfriend. So later that night I decide to check in on my boyfriend to see how his party was going, i told him that the twins showed up and he begins to act very uncomfortable. I asked him if he was okay and he said he was worried because a guy i used to talk to (in middle school by the way, i\u2019m a sophmore now) was there and his twin brother. I told him there was nothing to worry about because they both have girlfriends and they were keeping to themselves most of the night while me and my friends watch horror movies. Earlier that night my friend wanted to recreate a trend that was on tiktok with Ghostface where the victim lays face down on the floor, he sits on you and lifts ur head up by ur hair and holds a knife to your throat and I stuck my tongue out. I had no problem with it and I thought is was just a fun picture she wanted to take. I sent it to my boyfriend thinking he\u2019d find it funny and he didn\u2019t. He began freaking out and saying he didn\u2019t like it because the picture had a sexual vibe to it and because i\u2019m bisexual. I\u2019ve known the girl i\u2019ve taken the photo with since elementary school and i\u2019ve never saw her more than just a friend, maybe even a sibling. I tried reassuring him everything was okay but he wasn\u2019t having it. I just told him I was going to bed and i\u2019ll talk to him in the morning. Now he seems perfectly fine when I texted him this morning. \n\nI asked my SIL for advice and she said she\u2019s on my boyfriends side because it looks like the person who threw the party wanted to try and ruin my relationship with my boyfriend by taking the sexual picture and \u201cinviting an ex last minute.\u201d So AITA?", "created_utc": 1667147741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhir27/aita_for_going_to_a_halloween_party_my_friend/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is exhausting. You all sound immature and insufferable.", "NTA. Your SIL is out of touch. You were just having fun at a house party with friends. Nothing weird happened. You took a picture and your friend\u2019s family showed up. You don\u2019t control the guest list. Everyone needs to calm down.", "Yeah, no. You seem like the only one with any level of maturity\u2026including your SIL. You are very much NTA. That said, you may want to double check you\u2019re dating the right person for you. Most highs school relationships have a bit of jealously (as you\u2019re still new to relationships and learning how to have a functional and respectful one), but your bf\u2019s behavior is very discomforting. The fact that your SIL (am adult) agrees, is even more disturbing. I\u2019d be careful who you ask for advice from. \nYour judgement is solid. Trust it\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA- He's just young and insecure. He'll grow past it AFTER y'all break up. And I say after because as long as he's holding onto you he won't have room to check that mess and actually grow. It's probably a lesson he'll learn repeatedly. However, that being said, he has no real place to be mad. And the \"oh I don't like that because your bisexual\" is commonly (often without them realizing it) a method of control. Insecurities breed toxicity, if he feels he can't trust you then he shouldn't be with you because it puts an unnecessary burden on both your shoulders.\n\nTldr: if you didn't cheat on him and have no plans of cheating on him then you did nothing wrong. Don't expect this relationship to last forever AND be a healthy route. And sister is def taking his side bc it's his sister.", "NTA\n\nA dude you \u201cdated\u201d during the school day while in middle school is not an ex.   Your boyfriend is absurdly jealous and you\u2019d probably be better off without him.", "Not the AH. But people cheat on each other all the time (in as much as there seems to be endless reddit posts about it) and you guys are young and it takes years to develop self confidence. He's being silly, but probably isn't an AH overall (unless he is).", "Wow your boyfriend is BAD NEWS. So young, and he's already jealous and controlling? Break up, break up, break up.
