We were told that the wait would be around 20 minutes. We didn't mind it, wasn't too cold and there were maybe 4-5 people in front of us. Maybe 10 minutes later, the man in front of us started to get impatient and he complains out loud to everyone. Just being disrespectful , yelling into the restaurant at the staff to be faster or pointing at empty tables. My date tells him to calm down, she's tired of hearing him complain. Yes, he was annoying but I was just trying to enjoy my day and paid him no mind. He starts telling my date to shut up and that he can say what he wants. She tells him that she can do the same as well. Now, I'm the one getting bothered by all of this, very childish and it's been going on for more than 5 minutes.  The man and her were still bickering but the yelling stopped. I tell her that we can find another restaurant, I don't want to eat there anymore.\n\nShe got upset about that and asked me if I was going to let that man ruin our plans. I told her that,  no but her reaction to him will. She tells me to leave then, she will enjoy it by herself. I try to reason with her one more time but she tells me again to leave. So, I decided to go. As I crossed the street, I see the man tell her something and she chuckled. I'm pretty pissed about the whole situation especially since she said I was acting like a jerk in front of the real asshole.  And I did eat somewhere else and we met again afterwards.

This is a misleading title. Your title makes it sound like she wanted you to confront him and you refused. The description seems like she confronted him and didn't pull you into it until you said you didn't want to eat there.\n\nShe's not TA for confronting him - people being entitled crybabies in public isn't okay and more people should try to shame them. I think it's silly you didn't want to eat there anymore, but were willing to eat somewhere else (in my mind. the evening is either already ruined because of the interaction or it's salvageable, regardless of where you eat). But I also don't think her telling you to leave so she could eat alone is the right move on her part.\n\nI'm not sure how long you two have been dating, but if it's not long, it seems like your personalities might just not be compatible. If it's been a while, then you have to determine if this is who she is (and whether or not that's acceptable to you) or if it was a one-off situation where she just had enough", ">I told her that, no but her reaction to him will.\n\n...seriously?\n\nESH.  You're fine for not wanting to engage, but you're acting like the disrespectful yeller is totally blameless and also like she bears complete responsibility.  But mostly you two aren't compatible.", "ESH. This is one of those situations where you defend your partner in public, but later have a conversation about your real feelings on the matter with them. Have their back around others because nothing stings like the humiliation of confronting someone in public and your partner not having your back. You didn't need to \"go off\" on the guy, but just saying something like \"hey, please don't talk to my date like that. How about we all sit here quietly while we wait? I get that you have freedom of speech but you've had your complaint, so why keep repeating it?\" Then if he wants to continue on, you could say something to her like \"how about we leave the jerk here to complain and go somewhere ese?\" I bet she would have gladly agreed, thinking that you were \"getting one over\" on that guy. And if the roles were reversed, I'd say the same to her. Later you could tell her that you don't really want to go through that again, and while you understand her frustration, you'd likely not want to step in again. That way she has fair warning that it's not something you want to do, and she can adjust herself next time. And if she doesn't, then you have every right to say \"I told you I wouldn't do that again.\" So just take it as a learning experience. TL;DR: stand up for your partner in public, explain your feelings/expectations in private.", "You two should just go your own way. Not compatible at all. ETA", "NTA and it\u2019s wild to see people say otherwise. Obnoxious, irrational people can\u2019t be reasoned with not matter how much they deserve to be \u201cput in their place\u201d. If I were out with someone and they started an argument I\u2019d be annoyed that they dragged us into it, because now we don\u2019t know how the person they\u2019re arguing with is gonna act towards us over the course of an entire dinner.\n\nA lot of people in this thread have a weird dream of winning an argument against an annoying stranger in public but it just doesn\u2019t work that way. Keep to yourself and save your sanity.", "If you aren't going to have your partner's back in public, even when they're maybe not 100 in the right, that shouldn't be you're partner. YTA in my book for that", "NTA, but you might want to reexamine your compatibility with this woman, as you are very different people.", "So I am torn on how exactly I want to answer this. But I'm leaning towards YTA as opposed to esh like everyone else. But not necessarily how you've phrased you're reasoning.\n\nThe man in front of you was being a baby and also harassing the restaurant. I think this girl should be commended for trying to put him in his place. People have gotten too used to throwing tantrums and getting placated because it's easier. But at no point did she ask you to get involved.\n\nYou then acted like a child in a slightly different way. Because you decided you just wanted to leave. As someone else stated. It was either salvageable or not. Changing venue really wasn't going to affect much on that. Especially since you then blamed her for ruining the night.  That is what makes you the asshole.\n\nCould she have stopped bickering, sure. But in the end, honestly, it is what it is, and that guy deserved to be told off.", "Ahhhhhh, typical reddit. Of course morally, she's right to call out assholes, and asshole behavior. Realisticly she and everyone else who thinks that confronting them and making a scene in public is pretty dumb. You don't have any idea how someone will react to a situation. This dude could have any reaction to you calling them out. It is definitely not worth getting stabbed, hit, or any other negative outcome, in hopes of the positive one. Being morally right doesn't feel so good when a potentially dangerous person harms you. So NTA for not wanting to engage, but soft YTA for leaving her there alone.", "I see both sides. Comparability might be the real question here.", "I get your point about not wanting to get involved and you are right about the fact that her reaction to what happened is what ruined your date. \nBut you didn't have to tell her that there just to hide the fact that you rather avoid confrontation.\nSo yeah YATA. You should have stood up for your girlfriend first. \nAfterwards you could have investigated why your girlfriend felt the need to speak up before dismissing her reaction and feelings.", "NTA", "NTA. Your date loves drama and loves the attention, good riddance.", "Normally I'd say NTA, but your question is misleading. She didn't ask you to confront someone, she confronted someone herself and you were upset with her for it. To the point where you even said you wanted to leave.\n\nIf I were your date, I would have felt like you were trying to shame me by that. So I get her telling you to go without her. I don't know why you both met up later, it seems you're incompatible so why not just write off the whole thing?\n\nNAH. I get both sides, I get why each of you were annoyed by the other.", "How did she think she was helping the situation??", "Your gf should learn to shut it. Don't she know people have been killed in situations like this? All the people answering must be nerds from good neighborhoods.", "NTA - your date lowered herself to this guy's level by arguing with him.  It's fine if she is *that kind of person*, but she tried dragging you into the fight, even though you were clear that you didn't want to confront this guy.  And again, she instigated the confrontation, so it's not like you failed to defend her against an unwarranted attack.   She sounds like a loudmouth who likes to involve herself in other people's drama.  You sound reasonable, calm, and non-confrontational.  Personally, it sounds like you two are very incompatible.", "NTA. I would say you dodged a bullet. This wasn't her fight and she TA for trying to make what wasn't even her problem, your problem.", "YTA", "Dude, you won the bad date lottery. You found out she's a shitty person. BEFORE ordering food! \n\nHit the eject button and find someone else. NTA", "NTA.  \n\nYou met with her afterwards?  Why?  DO NOT DATE THIS WOMAN.  She sounds like the kind of person who would look through your phone and then slash your tires because you were texting your sister and she thought you were cheating.", "YTA You allowed another man to disrespect your girl. She was in the right and instead of having her back you ran away and left her in that situation. I get you may have been scared of the guy but your girl should mean enough to you to overcome your fear.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She decided to directly confront the guy. Maybe I'm biased as a New Yorker, but if you decided to make every person acting out is your business, you're gonna end up in hot water.", "Please do not listen to this, if you knock him out and he hits his head and dies she will not visit you in prison. If you get knocked and and hit your head, she will not be there for your mom next Christmas. Do not associate with people that are willing to put your safety on the line for their own attitude.", "Exactly! They're not compatible at all. They should each go their own way smh", "Kinda this, he was harassing the restaurant staff who can't really tell him off. She got him to stop yelling, and you told her that the behavior that did that ruined your night.

Don't pick a fight and expect help to be on the way.", "Um\u2026 WTF?", "You're not biased, it's the side effect of being chronically on reddit. You can say whatever you want to whoever you want with minimal consequences.

I guess people really do project their insecurities on others.", "where did she tell him to handle it?", "Okay first of all I wasn't trying to insult you anymore then your rage filled comment was insulting to me.\n\nSecondly the OP's girlfriend wasn't asking the OP to 'handle it for her'. But simply support her by not opting to change their plans because of a random guy and her reaction to him.\nThere was no fight and the OP's girlfriend was still able to chuckle at something the guy said even after he left.\n\nAnd you're right I shouldn't have lowered myself to your level! Thanks for the lesson.", "So were you not trying to insult me or did you lower yourself to my supposed level because you can't really have it both ways. My comment had no rage in it and was not personally directed at anyone person. You were trying to insult me by calling me a keyboard warrior and questioning my courage and if I could even stand up for myself. \n\nKeep back tracking all you want but it's clear that you just got caught in your feelings and lashed out, kinda like some type of qwerty soldier."]}
