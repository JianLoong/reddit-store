Whilst it\u2019s not a good solution to the problem and the kid didn\u2019t get hurt, but you shouldn\u2019t have done that. I know some kids don\u2019t make it easy but patience is key! I hope your little sister is okay. \nThe Mother is probably the biggest AHole here though. Yes, she has every right to be angry that you shoved her child but as an adult it would have been better to be stern than scream in a teenagers face. Even more so since she accused you of hurting your sister and not acknowledging her child\u2019s heinous attitude. He 100% acts like that because his Mother\u2019s attitude is just as bad. Learned behaviours.", "I mean. Yeah. You are. Dude, you're mad because he pushed your sister over, then you did the same to him, a kid 10 years your junior.\n\nYTA. I get you're angry, but you don't get to hurt kids, no matter what. You should have diverted him away. Stayed at your sister's side and blocked him off with your body. Generally not engage. Not push a seven year old, damn.\n\nWhen this happens to my niblings, I stand next to them and block the kid off from them, take back the toys from him, and just remain vigilant. At most I'd ask them to go to their guardian/tell me who is their adult/tell them to go away. I'd never push someone else's kid.", "I mean yes you are because you were 17 years old and he was 10 years younger than you. It would have been better for you to remove your sister from the situation if you couldn\u2019t find the parent of the child who kept harassing her.", "Technically, YTA. But fair play to you.

Maybe next time, just report it to the staff at the play area instead of giving that brat a shove though.", "Oh, we have all wanted to do that! Well played! You're NTA - but the mother of the 8/9yo is.\n\nWhere was she and why wasn't she supervising her child? If she'd been doing her job, you wouldn't have needed to step in. Typical case of crap parent thinking that play facilities are a babysitter and then deciding that \"little Johnny can do no wrong\" when I'm sure she's well aware that he misbehaves for attention (likely because she gives him none). She didn't witness the incident, so was going entirely on the word of a little brat, and considering that you were underage, too, she was out of line. If she'd been any kind of parent, she would have been watching him, reprimanding him, and checking that your little sister was ok. You were young and your sister could have had a head injury. As the only over 18 in the scenario, she should have acted like an adult. Instead, she showed where her kid gets his horrific attitude from...\n\nAs harsh as this sounds, you did more parenting (by standing up to that kid and reprimanding him) than his mother did that day... Was it the best way? Probably not, but you were 17. At least you intervened before someone was seriously hurt, which is more than she did. Crap parents like her create brats - you taught him a valuable lesson. Good on you!", "NTA,\n\nIt happens, obviously holidays one year my little lad was getting antagonised by another boy persistently, all my son wanted was to go down a slide..

The biggest AH is the mother who wasn\u2019t watching her child and didn\u2019t take responsibility when she was told by yourself what he was doing to your sister.", "I understand you felt that way but the best thing to do was to remove yourselves from the situation. \n\nI get that this feels unfair as you both had done nothing wrong and were not the aggressors, but at the end of the day this was where you needed to be the older party and take the relevant steps to protect your sister without putting hands on a child.", "Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nIt is the judgement. You were an AH. The 5yo was an AH. His mum was a huge AH. But you were still one too. You don't shove. You don't teach kids to not shove by shoving. Violence begets violence yadda yadda; no matter how careful you think you are you can still seriously hurt a kid like this.", "I know I definitely shouldn\u2019t have, but I just figured he\u2019s doing this because he knows he\u2019s bigger then her and my brain just though the same in the moment, I mean she was pouring her heart out because of the bump", "I definitely see that and can definitely say I was an asshole, but in the moment it felt like the right call", "Then you absolutely did what you felt was right and I don\u2019t think YTA. Anyone would do the same for their sibling I suppose", "Thank you I appreciate that. I absolutely know I was at fault somewhere but didn\u2019t think I was necessarily an AH", "Nah there\u2019s a reason why \u201cgo pick on someone your own size\u201d is a saying. The spoilt bully hopefully learnt a valuable lesson. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t have been as polite to the mother as you were. Id have given back more than she could handle so both her and her child went home crying but I\u2019m petty and vengeful\u2026 maybe I should work on that\u2026"]}
