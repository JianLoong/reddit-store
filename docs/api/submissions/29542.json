Looking for outside perspective as I don\u2019t want to talk to other relatives about this yet because I\u2019m worried it could cause an ugly conflict. This started roughly 8 months ago. My niece Sammy, in her mid 20s, was told to move out by my brother and his wife. At first she was doing well it seemed. She was working at a restaurant and got her brother Joseph, 18, a job there.She started missing work for what I understand to be various reasons, arguments with her boyfriend, not feeling well, etc. From what I\u2019ve heard, she would beg her brother to cover her shifts to keep her from getting suspended or fired. I was appalled to hear that on at least one weekend, Joseph worked his 2 shifts and 2 of Sammy\u2019s shifts between Friday and Sunday.\n\nUnfortunately Sammy was fired. Instead of finding another job she has roughed it by buying/re-selling merchandise online and about once a month making social media requests asking for money. Sammy lost her vehicle and was trying to save for another so she could begin working again. At the same time, Joseph was saving up to buy himself season tickets for the next NFL season. From what Joseph told me, his parents convinced him to give the $1500 he had saved up to Sammy as a way to pay her back for getting him his job. He did, and they also gave her $1500 dollars.\n\nWell, instead of getting herself a used vehicle, she \u201cloaned\u201d the money to her boyfriend to pay his lease. Of course both of them were in the red a month later. They have since moved back into my brother\u2019s basement because they are now expecting a child. For now my brother\u2019s plan is to keep them there as long as both of them find and keep jobs. Joseph lived in the basement and now moved into a much smaller room upstairs. I did not know most of this until this weekend when Joseph came to stay with me.\n\nHe tried to pass things off as normal but, after noticing he was acting strange, I pressed him and he finally opened up and told me all of this and then some. Yesterday I sent him home with a check for $1500. I told him to buy his season ticket, or something else fun for himself, and to deposit it immediately (I guess you can do that on phones now) and to under no circumstances give any of it to his sister or anyone else. I\u2019m not yet sure how, but his parents learned of it. I am, as they say, an AH for giving Joseph fun money while Sammy has needs. They accused me of playing favorites.\n\nAfter a day of contemplating, I am torn. I stand by my decision, but I do understand that it might look bad and like I am ignoring Sammy\u2019s situation. I just do not know how to help her in a way that will actually be useful, but I do know that this was useful to Joseph. He is still in high school (graduating in December) and should be having fun.

You can name any reason for that and I believe that\u2019s somewhat fair. \n\nSecond, I personally think it\u2019s a bit high of a price to expect 1,500 for help getting an entry level restaurant job. He repaid that- in my opinion- by trying to cover her shifts for her to help her keep hers. 4 shifts in a weekend sounds rough. \n\nAlso, Sammy is the older sibling. I feel like working in high-school should be for fun things you want. It\u2019s the only time in your life you get to do that! I bet she had that opportunity at his age. You simply gave that back to him. \n\nLastly, Sammy seems to have created her poor situation. Her brother shouldn\u2019t have to pay for that. I could see giving some cash to both, but not the full sum to Sammy. She makes poor choices with money and that alone is enough to not give her any. I would only offer to buy her groceries or things you can control the spending of due to her poor track record.", "NTA at all. WTF are these parents doing? They guilted the boy into giving up hard earned and saved money - some of which was earned covering his sister's ass at her job? I've got news for these parents, and for anyone who thinks a favor needs to be repaid until the end of time - this boy already repaid the favor of getting his job and then some. Moreover, they have NO right to tell you who you can give YOUR money too. They are playing horrible favorites and I feel sorry for their son. I hope he is able to move away from them ASAP.", ">They accused me of playing favorites.\n\nThat's really funny coming from the people who are enabling the sister and pressuring the hard working brother to also subsidize the sister.\n\nYou were really good to reimburse the brother for the fun money he was pressured to give to his sister.\n\nIt's clear that any money given to the sister at this point would simply enable her and her bf to put off getting a job. Don't feed the bottomless pit.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. \n\nJoseph\u2019s parents are failing him, but you don\u2019t have to. Kinda funny they\u2019re accusing you of playing favorites when they pressured him into giving his sister $1500 because she makes objectively shitty life choices.\n\nThis has \u201cwhy does my son not talk to me anymore\u201d written all over it in 10 years.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your nephews job at ALL to help bail her out so he should have never been made to give her the 1500. Sounds like he already \u201cpaid her back\u201d for getting that job by simply\u2026 constantly covering her shifts. Not to say he should have to \u201cowe her\u201d at all.\n\nI understand their parents are probably panicked and figuring their son will survive the changes, but they\u2019re totally ignoring his well being to dump energy on a proven unreliable daughter. Hopefully the parents don\u2019t completely abandon paying attention to Sammy when they inevitably are primary caretakers for the new baby on the way. Glad you\u2019re there to keep an eye out for him, many kids out there don\u2019t have that extra support. \n\nIncredibly kind of you to not only be keeping a close eye on his well being but also gifting him so generously.", "NTA at all, sounds like you are the only one really advocating for Joseph\u2019s best interests. My guess is the parents found out because they are still on his bank account (which also means they may have access to/may have already taken the money from him). It would be a good idea to help him set up an account at a separate bank and help him plan financially to get out of the house asap after graduation. This situation sounds like he is at high risk for financial abuse where he is expected to pay high rent and babysit for free. If you live nearby and can take him in, even better. You can spin it to his parents that \u201cYou all need more room with the baby on the way! So Joseph is going to come stay with me, you\u2019re welcome!", "NTA. Good job Uncle Don!\n\nI am **horrified** that the parents made him give his money \u2018as a thank you\u2019. But bright side time\u2026it\u2019s clear that the parents enabling their daughter is what contributed to her being the way she is. Same goes for your nephew. So all this BS from them has a payoff for him in the end bc he sounds like a great \u2018kid\u2019.", "NTA. Joseph worked hard and saved enough money to spend on something he wanted to do. He earned it and then his parents made him give all his money to his sister. He\u2019s being punished for her actions, but he did nothing wrong. He deserves a treat", "NTA- if anyone has a playing favourites it\u2019s the parents..", "NTA. Your nephew sounds like a great kid.", "**NTA**  Your brother and SIL are the ones playing favorites.   They let Sammy take advantage of Joseph then took his savings from him on the flimsiest of pretexts.   Then they took his room so spoiled sis and her deadbeat baby daddy could move in.   Your brother should be glad that *someone* is looking out for Joseph.\n\nDon't give Joseph any money that his parents can trace.   Put it in a special account for him and give him a debit card that only he can use to access *his* money.   Warn him to keep mum about the existence of that money.", "NTA. It is your money to do as you wish.  He gave money to his sister, his parents gave money to his sister, and she essentially threw it away.  You are giving him money to make up for the money he wasted on his sister.  He's lucky to have you as it is obvious the sister is the one getting all the attention and support in that house.", "NTA. You're basically replacing money he was forced to give away. It's great you're in a situation to do that and are teaching him to be mindful about money by making him deposit it immediately.\n\nYou are not responsible for digging your niece out of a hole. Even if you wanted to teach her to be responsible with money, the fact that she and her bf were in the red a month after receiving 3000 means she's a money pit.\n\nThose kids parents are... frustrating to put it mildly.", "NTA; it's your money and you do whatever you want with it. They're adults. Sammy has poor judgment and her parents are just enabling her victim/charity entitlement.", "This is my second \"tell me who the GC is without telling me\" in a couple of days\n\nThat makes me really, really sad to have to do, but alas, facts are facts\n\nNTA \n\nI can understand, from an objective, outsiders perspective, why Joseph and Sammy's parents are upset\n\nIn their eyes, Joseph is in high school, and not an expecting parent \n\nBUT\n\nHE'S IN HIGH SCHOOL and not continually making poor life choices like trying to bulldoze his younger sibling into covering his work shifts, and then getting his gf pregnant with a child they can't afford\n\nIts not his fault that his older sister is making poor life choices, and he should have never had his money taken from him by his parents to try to cover his sisters ass because she can't get her life straight \n\nAll you tried to do, was right a wrong that you saw was done to your nephew\n\nEta I accidentally posted my same post twice, I deleted the second copy, my bad!!", "NTA at all. All of the situations that Sammy is in she\u2019s put herself in. His parents should have never manipulated him into giving his hard earned money to his sister for her to spend it on her boyfriend. Sounds like the sister needs a wake up call. You were right to give Joseph that money.", "To you NTA, the siblings\u2019s parents are likely the butts, your nephew isn\u2019t and I\u2019m not really gonna say your niece is either.\n\nAll the issues seem to stem around the boyfriend and everything bad that has happened recently is seeming to be associated with him. Maybe mention to the parents and check in with the niece to ensure she\u2019s actually ok and this guy isn\u2019t taking advantage of her or abusing her.\n\nYou can get illness from stress after all.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t give him fun money, you gave him back the money that his parents stole from\nhim using emotional blackmail. In this situation his sister still got more then him, 1.5k from him and 1.5 from her parents. The sisters is 3k in the red, while you just insured you nephew was back to net zero.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Giving money added to the conflict (though it shouldn\u2019t have, but they\u2019re those kind of people), likely they\u2019ll try to guilt/force the money to be given to them by nephew and that puts the pressure on him again. Maybe they already did and now he has to deal with that. \n\nI find it hard to hold it against you though, you were trying to make up for the unfairness your nephew is experiencing when you don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d anyone your money and can give it, or not, how you want. \n\nI don\u2019t think your intent is wrong, but how you went about it sucks a bit as it should have been a bit obvious how they\u2019d react (entitled, rude, wanting money). \n\nSending a cheque, rather than direct deposit or etransfer or something electronic (even through the bank), which is easily findable is also something that was foolish in that situation. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet how\u201d \ud83d\udc40", "Soft YTA\u2014I applaud Joseph\u2019s efforts but $1500 is a lot of FUN money for a high school kid.

There is no entry level position in ANY restaurant which justifies a monetary gift as thanks, let alone $1,500. That\u2019s absolutely insane. Your niece is an intentional leech to society with her social media posts. If that\u2019s the way she wants to live her life then let her. Your nephew was coerced by people he views as figures of authority to give away his hard-earned(incredibly hard, working in restaurants) money to support his sister\u2019s newfound, non-working lifestyle.\n\nEdit to add: the only ones playing favorites here are your brother and his wife, shunting your nephews hard work and ambition so they can coddle their daughter.", "NTA!!!  Your post is clearly written & I agree with your point. Who the heck pays a sibling $1500.00. For \"helping\" get a job?!  Mid twenties, I was working full time, married & house hunting then.

Your niece and the parents need a full reality check.  They also owe your nephew every cent back plus interest.", "NTA. Sammy put herself into her current situation with her repeated poor choices.

Hopefully, your nephew will be able to get out of that house soon. They all sound terrible.", "NTA", "Of course you are not the AH here.  The parents think the female child needs help because she obviously cannot manage for  herself.  Parents and Sammy will always have a thorn in their paw over this unless you do something to even it up, in their eyes.  \n\nA possible solution to your unnecessary guilt might be to even things up, for now, but not for forever.\n\nTell them straight up you don\u2019t agree that things should always be \u201cfair\u201d because life is not fair.  Joseph worked for the money it is rightfully his.  Sammy fooled around and lost it all. \n\nTell them you have decided to gift Sammy the same amount BUT it won\u2019t be in cash form.  It will be a savings for when her child is born and which you will control.  She has proven that she is not responsible enough to manage money and that the money will be for items for the child and only the child.  You will use it to pay doctor bills for the child, only the child\u2019s doctor bills.  Give the bills to you, you pay them and when the money is all gone, it\u2019s is done, you are done with cash gifts from then on.  \n\nMaybe Joseph can lean on you privately so he has some support.  \n\nFrom here on out you will be giving gifts as you wish and if the parents have a problem than you will give no more gifts period.\n\nFor Joseph, you can do lots of activities with him and spend as much on those outings as you wish..Sammy will be busy with baby and bf (if he sticks around) so she won\u2019t be invited.  Buying Joseph stuff will only cause problems for him when he gets home, but the good times will never be forgotten.  \n\nGood luck and best wishes!", "NTA. Period.

It doesn't sound like you approve of the choices your niece is making, and you're looking for a way to show your disapproval.  Maybe she is headed towards the life of a deadbeat, but 20 years old is still young enough that you shouldn't write her off so fast.  Your family deserves at least a little more benefit of the doubt and a chance to turn things around.  Your explicit instructions to your nephew not to share the money feels punitive towards her, and possibly putting him in an awkward position.  It's causing family drama already.  The better approach would have been to gift your nephew the season tickets directly, so that it was clearly a gift for him and not a jab at her.", "Marx suggested \u201cFrom each according to their abilities and to each according to their needs.\u201d   Sounded good but in practice it incentivized the population to be incompetent and needy.
