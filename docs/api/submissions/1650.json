I had to tell her that not only did I not know, but I didn\u2019t want to find out until the baby was born. I want it to be a complete surprise to not only me, but everyone else. I\u2019ve heard too many stories about people having sly remarks about not having a certain gender and I don\u2019t want to have to worry about any of that throughout this pregnancy. My future MIL asked if she could go to my next appointment and learn the gender in private so that she could order gender specific items for the baby to have when it arrived. She promised not to tell anyone but I don\u2019t trust her. She is very upset and keeps making remarks about how inconvenient it is for everyone to not know the gender because they can\u2019t gift properly. She also says a baby shouldn\u2019t be surrounded by a boring beige nursery room, but I haven\u2019t even decided on decorations for that. She\u2019s now hounding my fianc\u00e9 to find out the gender but he\u2019s on board with not knowing.

They\u2019re not the one popping a watermelon-sized tiny human out of their hoo-hah!\n\nJust be prepared that your MIL will probably try to get in your husband\u2019s head and be sneaky about it. Also, inform your doctors that if they get a call asking about the gender to shut that down and inform you ASAP.", "NTA at all. Things like this will happen pretty much the babies whole life.

Best wishes to you and your growing family!", "NTA, absolutely. And \"can't gift properly\" is a crock. With my first, we sincerely did not know the gender. We still had plenty of clothes in green and yellow. With my second, the tech nearly told us the wrong gender! Initially, she thought the baby was the same gender as my first. At the end of the appointment, the baby shifted, the tech got a better view, and corrected herself. So, yeah, that can happen. Feel free to share my story if you think it'll help.

We did keep his name a secret however and I\u2019ll never regret that. That being said, we had the same comments of \u201cinconvenience for others\u201d to which we replied it was not in any way inconvenient as we didn\u2019t want them to gift anything anyway.

You get to be all anxious for months about whether she will keep her mouth shut. All so she can have more fun shopping?! \n\nThat's really selfish.", "NTA. Plenty of people wait until birth to find out the gender. Because of this, plenty of baby items are sold in \u2018gender neutral\u2019 colors and styles. Those items are no less fun for baby, and pretty easily available. And a lack of gender assignment does NOT mean a boring beige room. Colors aren\u2019t for specific genders! The \u2018pink for girls blue for boys\u2019 mentality is at best traditional and annoying and at worst transphobic.\n\nIf MIL really has a problem with it, could she wait until the baby is born to gift you with her items?", "NTA.  This is your and your fianc\u00e9s baby.  There is no reason for anyone else to know the gender if you don\u2019t want to know.

Congrats and I think electing not to know is great.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want to know, specifically instruct your doctor and ultrasound technician that you don't want anyone knowing and don't want your baby's gender noted anywhere on your records.\n\nBe warned that a grandmother who is this insistent about knowing the baby's gender will also push boundaries in other ways.  For instance, she may push to be in the delivery room, voice her opinion about your baby names, want to stay at your home after your birth, etc...  \n\nYou need to put MIL on an information diet immediately.", "NTA. You've told her what you want but she can't respect your choice and can't even shut up about it. She needs to find better ways to spend her time.", "NTA there are tons of cute ways to prepare for a baby without relying on typical gendered clothing and decor. She can get creative.", "NTA\n\nLemon, mint, grey, white... there are lots of gender neutral colours. You don't need specific coloured items to go along with gender of baby. \n\nI mean how did people survive before gender scans was available?! Its not a inconvenience either.

Stand your ground and set boundaries with your MIL because if she is acting like this now I can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019ll be like once the baby is born.

As for nursery themes you could so jungle themed, rainbow themed, Disney themed, a specific animal like parrots, etc none of which are boring beige.  She's using a poor bullshit reason to try to manipulate you into letting her find out the sex.", "NTA. When I was pregnant I refused to find out the sex of my child. I felt that giving birth was just like Christmas and the baby was the present. Finding out these at birth was all part of the surprise. I don\u2019t understand what everyone needs to know the sex.", "Sad that your future MIL has made it to her age and doesn't realize all people can wear all colors. There is literally no baby product/ gift that your child will be operating with their genitals. Problem solved.  NTA.", "NTA. Gender is not a big deal, and the longer you keep your future child from gender-specific stereotypes the better for them. Your family will survive the non-gendered gift giving process, and it might make them a little more open minded.  I say all the colours of the rainbow is the way to go!", "NTA.

Keep it up grandmama and risk going NC. NTA.", "NTA. Why are people so obsessed with gender? There are plenty of colors that you can use for a baby. Blue and pink are colors that society tells us are colors for boys and girls.", "NTA 100%\n\nI\u2019m a midwife and the majority of the couples I care for don\u2019t want to find out the sex of their babies, but some end up doing so because of pressure like this from their families. \n\nThe presence of a penis or vulva should make absolutely no difference to gift buying. \n\nStay strong! It will absolutely be worth it when you and your partner find out together, I promise!", "NTA.", "NTA, obviously.", "NTA this is your first baby. There is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing how you want to do any of it. People will have to deal with it. This is 100% your choice.", "NTA\n\nWhile I see her intents might be good if she just wants to get some baby clothing in advance and stuff, there's plenty of good gender neutral stuff out there.

You\u2019re the parents, and you get final say. I wouldn\u2019t trust her to not spill the beans. I\u2019d be worried that she\u2019d tell you since she\u2019s against you not knowing. Don\u2019t let her know and let the doctor know just in case she tries to call", "NTA. Firstly, this is the only true surprise you experience in life. No one, except the medical staff, knows your baby\u2019s gender. Secondly, for 100,000+ years, humanity has managed to figure out a way forward without knowing a gender. Your MIL isn\u2019t special, she doesn\u2019t need special knowledge. \n\nWe did not find out the gender of either of our kids and we loved it. It made the surprise at birth extra special, as well as the guessing game. Do what works for you, not everyone else.", "Absolutely NTA! \nI wish someone would've told me what I'm about to tell you. It. Is. Your. Baby. And. Therefore. It. Is. YOUR. Choice!\nI didn't even need to read the whole thing to know this. It is your decision and if you let MIL influence you otherwise, she will continue to do it when baby gets here and rhen you'll have a whole new set of problems on your hands. Establish your boundaries now so there won't be an issue later.", "NTA. Mute her messages.", "First off, Congratulations!!!! Second umm no. Your baby, your privacy, your choice!\n\nJust wait! The next annoying thing is \"WHY CANT I BE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM?!?!?\" \n\nStand your ground. You run this show! Future husband needs to set her straight. This will stress you and the baby out if he doesn't nip it in the bud.", "I did this, it was the best. Called the baby the Alien as she/he was changing my body beyond belief! I was 40.\n\nYou do your pregnancy as you want it, and your MIL can keep her nosey nose out of your business. Set your boundaries now.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If people are confused about which color to get, just tell them green or yellow or white or something. It's really not that complicated, I don't understand all the hand-wringing about pink or blue. Baby isn't going to get a rash from wearing the \"wrong\" color.", "NTA You baby, your rules.  That being said, I'm old so that option was not available to me, so I find it weird that you wouldn't want to know.  I say finding our you are pregnant is surprise #1, then a few months later with surprise #2 you get the gender.  Then surprise #3 is the date birth finally happens & #4 is the actual sweet baby that I get to hold in my arms upon delivery.  The I & friends & family can decorate the nursery & buy gifts to suit the gender etc. That being said.  This isn't about me & what I wish I could have done with my kids.  You do you & MIL is just gonna have to suck it up.  I would also notify your Dr. that you don't want to know, nor do you want him to tell ANYONE else. Congratulations & good luck.", "Congratulations! Definitely NTA!!!", "Your MiL will absolutely tell everyone. Also all colors should be gender neutral. Nta", "NTA \nPeople used to welcome their babies just fine before there was a way to determine the gender. Or buy gifts just fine. \n\nMy sons favorite color is pink. He\u2019s got a pink accent wall in his room that he adores. And he\u2019s perfectly well and awesome. He loves trains, his pretend power tools and putting his doll to bed and cuddles with a Thomas the train plushie and a ballerina kitty plushie. \n\nColors don\u2019t have a gender. So that argument is null. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve got invasive and impatient family. I hope you can distance yourself a little so they don\u2019t annoy you too much.", "NTA. Paint the nursery a beautiful green or bright sunny yellow. So not beige. Not boring at all. It's not hard to buy gender neutral clothes either. She's just being difficult.", "NTA- it is your choice to have a surprise! They can buy neutral colours or wait until the birth! \n\nhe needs to tell her to back off", "NTA\nwtf is YOUR child you're carrying them so the choice is only up to you and your fiance don't let her ruin what you want", "NTA, my mother in law did this with both of my children\u2019s births, except with their names, not genders. she even pulled the same thing, she wanted to \u201cmonogram stuff\u201d (which btw she never did) and she said it \u201cwasn\u2019t fair to her friends who wanted to know \u201c", "NTA. I just had my own surprise gender baby a few weeks ago and it was so worth it. Don\u2019t let her find out, there\u2019s really no point. She can buy gendered clothes when the baby gets here.", "NTA.  No way is that woman not going to blab it to everyone she sees.  It's your body, you get to decide who goes to appointments and how involved anyone else is.   If she continues to be so pushy, keep her out of the delivery suite (most hospitals now have the area secure and only those allowed can get anywhere nearby) and even make it so she is the LAST person to know.", "NTA \n I'm old enough to remember when you didn't have an option of knowing the gender before the baby was born. I had no clue what my kids would be and the grandmother had no place in the dr. appointment or the delivery room. We did just fine and so will you. Every color is acceptable. Not everything is pink and blue! Enjoy your little one.", "If you truly want the gender to be a surprise, go against convention and don\u2019t find out the gender before hand. Wait for the birth. We didn\u2019t know what we were going to have back when i had my kids. Pink or blue outfits can be picked out later. For that matter, people have been having baby showers for years. You can still do that. We did have boy and girl names picked out. Oddly enough, I never really got attached to a particular girls name. Never had a girl, but had two boys. Let MIL know that most newborns aren\u2019t too picky about what they\u2019re wearing. There will be plenty of time to shop.   \nYou know, today, so many things are instant gratification, I\u2019ve seen so many gender reveals online, as well as thousands of cupcakes with pink or blue icing. Frankly, I find it repetitious. You don\u2019t have to follow everyone else. I assume you want a happy, healthy, baby, boy or girl. Stick to your guns. Be different. Let it be a surprise for you and your fianc\u00e9. Then call the new grandparents.", "NTA. In my country, we've had incidents of babies been born, the opposite gender as the one the doctor claimed. So we have boys in pink for 3 months and girls in blue. But so far, I haven't heard of a single child dying of wearing blue or pink.\n\nYour MIL is just firing warning shots of the kind of grandma she'll be. Overbearing, without boundaries etc. Just ignore her, she'll get the hint soon enough.\n\nI have 4 children and I always found out sex after giving birth. I love the pleasant surprise of being told the sex", "NTA she isn't the pregnant person, she has no say in when she gets info, or how much she's told.\n\nAlso, she may need to be reminded that there are more colors out there than pink, blue, and BEIGE.", "You're absolutely NTA.\n\nYour body, your rules.\n\nHead on over to r/JNMIL too. There will be many a person who's been in your shoes and they may have some good advice, if you're interested.\n\nCongrats on your pregnancy!", "NTA!!!! Your baby your choice to know. \n\nOn a complete side note if you do let your MIL come to the ultra sound ask the clinic before hand to not tell, and the reason it\u2019s so important. Most clinics will simply say oh sorry mom in law but baby just is not cooperating today and we sadly can\u2019t see the babies gender. Saved a friend of mine from his mom finding out.", "NTA, I'll never understand why people care so much about this stuff.", "Most of human history, nobody knew until it came out.  People need to chill.  It's not a forever secret.  NTA.", "They should fuck with everyone and ask people to get green gifts.  Leave them questioning.", "We bought my soon to arrive Grand nephew mostly green stuff (blankets, hooded towels, wash rags, paci clip, wicker storage basket with green and pink trim , no clothes yet)to go with the woodland nursery theme his parents chose. Why would you assume people would only buy pink or blue??", "You don't even need to go with a color theme, I did jungle theme until my daughter was old enough to express her own likes and now her room is Minnie Mouse this and Blues Clues that. Why does it need a theme anyway? Have fun with it! Isn't it the child's room anyway? Soon she'll have to redecorate anyway! No gender means more wide range of gifts!", "My mom and dad decorated my nursery with pastel yellows, pastel and medium greens, some blues and pinks, too. I think they had a dinosaur theme for me, too. But my memory on their \"theme\" is a bit fuzzy, I'll admit.  Same for when my little sister was born (they did not know either of our genders pre-birth). They literally did not care what color anything was. My mom has said several times that she would have put boy or girl into whatever pink or blue clothes she got. As she said \"baby doesn't care\" what color they wear.", "Except do it like 3 or 4 times. Why not both? Tell her you having twins, one of each", "Savage!

Baby girls were dressed in nonpastel blue because it was considered a \u201cdocile\u201d color and baby boys in red, because it was a \u201cstrong\u201d color. But though various washings, the dye would fade to baby blue and pink. Somewhere along the way the colors switched for the genders. But for some reason the pastel trend stuck.", "Pink is for girls and blue is for boys is actually a relatively recent thing ~1940s. Before that (and even to this day in some countries) it is the opposite. Pink is masculin because red is a strong colour. Blue is strongly associated with femininity - if you look at older paintings you\u2019ll notice girls (esp the Virgin Mary) are always in blue! We can blame the deregulation of advertising on TV as well as the fact that sailor suits for boys were blue for the current state of things.
