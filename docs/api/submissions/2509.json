{"id": 2509, "submission_id": "yx7x2z", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go on vacation with a guy who makes me uncomfortable?", "selftext": "Some background: a few months ago, my friend Jesse (25F) threw a party where she introduced me (24M) to her friend Brian (23M). Brian instantly seemed to instantly take a liking to me. I've seen Brian quite a few times since then because I go clubbing/bar hopping with Jesse and her friends pretty often. Basically every time I see Brian, he'll ask why/how I'm single, tell me I'm such a catch, and act very touchy with me. \n\nBrian has had a few instances of boundary-crossing behavior. One time Brian started asking me questions about my sex life in front of a group of people. I told him I don't talk about my sex life with people besides my partners. But he wouldn't take no for an answer and started loudly making up his own narratives (I bet OP likes getting spanked in bed, OP you would probably like being pegged, etc). Brian has also tried a few times to set me up with random girls despite me not asking. On a couple of nights out this has led to some poor girl awkwardly following me and my friends around because Brian misled and encouraged her.\n\nGenerally it seems like Brian enjoys putting people in awkward situations for his own amusement, which along with his over-touchiness makes me slightly uncomfortable. Nothing too malignant and he seems like a nice person otherwise.\n\nA few weeks ago, my friend Anna (24F) asked if I wanted to go on a vacation to [nearby city] with Jesse and a few of our other mutual friends, I initially said yes because it seemed like fun. Yesterday they made the vacation group chat and none of the mutual friends Anna mentioned are in it. The people going on the vacation are Jesse and her boyfriend, our friend Becca and her boyfriend, Anna and her hookup/situationship, along with me, Brian, and another guy Daniel who I don't know well. \n\nNot wanting to go on a couples trip, I lie and say something came up so I can't make it. Anna privately messages me to ask why I'm backing out when I enthusiastically agreed last week, and after some pestering I admitted why Brian makes me uncomfortable. I thought she might understand and maybe tell Brian to lay off but she instead got really angry with me, called me homophobic, and isn't responding to my texts. I'm not yet sure if she's badmouthing me to our mutual friends. \n\nAm I being homophobic in my reasons for not liking Brian? Anna thinks so because in her words I was \"sooo comfortable\" when Jesse's friend Natalie was acting touchy last weekend but uncomfortable with Brian being touchy. But that's totally different? I'm fine with close friends or a girl I'm flirting with being touchy but not someone like Brian who I'm not close with. Plus I'm uncomfortable with Brian for other reasons besides the touchiness.

She changed everything to the point that it's a different trip. That's on her.\n\nAlso, Brian needs to take a hint and having a crush on someone does not allow you to make them uncomfortable or force them into situations publicly or privately that they object to.
