There\u2019s nothing wrong with sleeping in, but you make preparations for that. Have clothes laid out the night before, shower the night before, have your stuff ready to go, etc. She didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a her issue. \n\nI get she\u2019s pregnant and emotions get to be a bit much. You could have reminded her to get everything together the night before, I guess, but what else can you do?

It sounds to me like she is overextended and perhaps exhausted, and needs more rest now in the last trimester.  \n\nYou don't say how many children you already have, but it is more than one.  The church needs to find someone else to teach the children during the service for at least the next year, starting soon.  If she has a job, start planning when she will be able to go on leave.\n\nThe health of your wife and the little one who is not yet born is more important than any church or community obligations that your wife may have.  Your wife sounds like the kind of person who consistently works hard and does a great job at whatever she takes on.\n\nYou did a lot to help your wife today, OP, and it's understandable that you want some appreciation.  My take on this is that she is cranky from being very, very tired.  \n\nTalk to her.", "NTA", "6 months pregnant other kids she's exhausted", "NTA. She chose to sleep 30 min more. Yes she\u2019s pregnant but there are always consequence to one\u2019s actions. She couldn\u2019t expect you to be late to church for her late start. You helped a lot. Just let it slide.  She\u2019s pregnant and tired. Few more months and she should be normal again.", "NTA But my dude, your wife is six months pregnant and you're quite right, nothing IS good enough...  everything sucks, her boobs leak, her stomach has new scars, she's not sleeping well and a thousand other small annoyances. Give her a LOT of grace.", "She\u2019s pregnant, dummy. She not thinking like a regular person. NTA but neither is she.", "NAH, It sounds like you guys have a pretty solid system that is being challenged by the pregnancy. She sleepier and weepier than usual. Keep communicating and be civil together. It will blow over.", "NTA.\n\nYou did your best, she didn't ask for more help and the silent treatment is a toxic behaviour.\n\nShe has to learn to communicate. You don't read minds.", "YTA, being a little late to church isn\u2019t going to send you to hell \n\nIt\u2019s essentially a big book club that\u2019s discussing the same back for thousands of years I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve missed out on anything important, your wife is pregnant with your child and you\u2019re worried about being late for church, come on dude", "NTA. But this should be a fairly minor situation. Basically every family with kids will be late to church at some point. If you and your wife are having enough of a fight over this for her to give you to cold shoulder and you to turn to reddit, then maybe you guys need some marriage counseling. Even healthy marriages sometimes need a tune up.", "NTA you did help! Your wife shouldn\u2019t have slept later if she can\u2019t manage in shorter time.", "You sound a bit petty, but when you say \u2018nothing is ever good enough\u2019 it makes me think you may always have excuses. What do you mean by that? Cuz if thats how you feel another kid isnt the best way potentially.", "NTA- buy her favorite snacks or give her a foot massage though I'm pretty sure it's pregnancy hormones", "NTA.  Your wife is not being very Christian.  She probably should not be teaching Sunday School.", "The flesh is weak..", "Did you check she was good to go/needed anything else before going?", "No, nothing is every good enough.  Does your church have trained counselors attached to it?  If not, you need to find a licensed marital therapist yesterday.  The silent treatment is not OK.  This level of high demands and low gratitude is not OK.  Deal with this now, before there's a child in the mix.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t think God really judges someone for being late to worship them. \n\nYou know what God does judge, though? Husbands who make their pregnant wife lift heavy items\n\nYTA", "NTA- You're 100% right here. I did have to think back when you said she was 6 months pregnant lol but you did get up on time take care of the crafts and kids into the car etc. It was her decision to sleep in. Note to self DO NOT SLEEP IN ON SUNDAYS! haha", "NTA. \n\nYour a good guy. She maybe dealing with hormones but see if she can see later how much effort you have already made.", "NAH\u2014she\u2019s pregnant, nothing is rational when pregnant even when we try to be lol!! give her some grace & maybe take a break from church/sunday school for her. let the woman sleep, she\u2019s growing another human!!!", "Nah they\u2019re still banging out the old stuff", "He gets really mad when folks don't show up on time to praise him.\n\nOh Lord, you are so Big...", "Remastered version", "It sucks, but unfortunately many churches believe that the parents with the most kids need to do the most to help Sunday school, since they benefit the most from it. I think that's stupid, since parents of toddlers have the least time and sanity, but it's a common belief. Thankfully our church has teens and empty nesters run childcare and Sunday school, but that's pretty rare.", "Few more months and she'll be even more tired from being up with the baby.", "yes plus that third trimester exhaustion starts to hit!!!", "your judgment should be NAH, \u201cNTA\u201d implies wife is the AH :) just for your information!", "Sounds like your issues are more with christianity than my actions", "What a bigot.", "How I feel is under appreciated for helping when I rarely get much help in return", "The wife is probably tired and cranky, pregnancy is not an easy thing. And it has nothing to do with being more Christian or not lmao emotions and feelings are something natural. Damn, even Jesus got really angry when he found out about the black market, remember?", "Gosh we\u2019re all really impressed down here I can tell you", "and taking care of the other kids, they already have, as well \ud83d\ude05", "Yeah Christianity isn't well recieved around reddit my man.", "So your wife is unappreciative in general?", "You can dislike Christianity but the man's religion is not the topic here, respect people even tho they have beliefs you don't endorse. That's just basic moral compass stuff.", "Shouldn't be anywhere.", "One of the reasons I heart Reddit", "Which is dumb, only the sects that don\u2019t marry gay people or the ones who don\u2019t allow women equal positions of authority should not be tolerated but the other ones are fine.", "For good reason.", "I agree im just saying reddit is ruthless with that stuff.", "The ones that marry gay people and give women full equality shouldn\u2019t be shunned, and when one happens hell will freeze over lol"]}
