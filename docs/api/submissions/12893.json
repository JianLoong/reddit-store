Jane and I were both tech majors and had the same intro to programming class. In order to graduate you need to at least know how to code. From the very beginning, it was clear that Jane was struggling in class. Midway through the semester, she would ask me to teach her how to do the basics. But no matter how she tried, she still couldn't do it. In the end, we both passed the class, but she still couldn't write any code.\n\nEvery so often, we would be in the same classes. She would always ask me for help with homework. We are not exactly close, but we are on friendly terms. We do not really hang out outside of class except when we're studying together or when I am teaching her something. She also does not text me except when she needs help with homework or studying. I always end up helping her because I don't like refusing to help people. It's also because I truly understand what she is going through; I know what it's like to not instantly understand what you're learning no matter how hard you try. However, it's clear that she has made no attempt to at least learn how to code or understand basic concepts or theories. She gave up on trying to figure out new topics and often asked to see my answers. By the time I graduated, she still couldn't code even if her life depended on it.\n\nOne of the final classes we need to take is our senior project class. In this class, we have to make a functioning application and write a research paper explaining our design process. Everyone in our major knew about this class long before they took it, and I know for a fact she was aware of it.\n\nJane took the class the semester after I graduated. A few weeks into the class, she suddenly texted me. She was begging me to help her with her senior project. She wanted me to code the entire application for her and said that she would write the research paper. All I literally had to do was write code. and she even offered me money. She sounded really desperate, saying that she just really wanted to graduate. This time, I refused to help her for multiple reasons. First, it didn't sit right for me to have someone claim they did all the work on their own when they didn't. It's unfair for our classmates who worked hard to complete their projects. Second, I honestly did not have the time nor motivation to do it. I'm the eldest daughter, and I spend a lot of my time helping out my family in addition to prepping for interviews, applying to jobs, practicing coding, etc. It also makes me wonder why she let herself get to this point. She could have done a lot of things like switching majors or taking the time to learn the material, and yet, she didn't.\n\nIt's been months since I refused to help her, and I am still not sure if I did the right thing. It would honestly be really terrible if she didn't get to graduate all because I refused to help her.

Good thing you didn't do it.", "10 PRINT \"NTA\"\n\n20 GOTO 10", "NTA as someone who's also in college right now and who is a people pleaser I hate how willing some people are to take advantage of or rely on the kindness of others. I'm taking 5 classes which are basically all seminars right now yet every class I am one of the very few, if not the only one who shows up prepared to engage and everyone just slacks off because they have no desire to contribute to group learning. Also, it's not your responsibility to clean up when your friend doesn't have the clarity to be aware of the fact that she chose a major that was unsuitable for her and she has no right to be mad at you about it. Plus, you can say that you do not want to face any future ramifications it could have on your professional or academic life if it somehow was revealed that you were involved in and enabled blatant academic dishonesty. Be confident in knowing that any rational person would take your side lol.", "NTA. You taught her repeatedly or at least tried, she has to take charge and responsibility eventually for her own actions and as you said, she could've taken a lot of different approaches, but decided for the most risky route, namely trying to get someone who helped her time and again to do the project for her.\n\nTL;DR: The risk she took was calculated, but turns out she is also not good at math.", "NTA. You would have been the A if you did do her project.", "NTA. If she can't do the work, what does she expect to happen in the real world?", "NTA. If you got caught, that could ruin your relationship with the school and future employers. \n\nIdk if they could take back your degree. \n\nIt\u2019s not about not helping, but not risking your livelihood.

Bad juju letting her tag along without learning anything, then cutting her off. Still her fault, but you have to face your role in enabling her. \n\nPeople in school have to do their own work, or work with a tutor, but they have to learn to do the work. Especially something like coding. You can't fake ability or knowledge in the real world.", "NTA - If she wants to graduate then have her earn her degree by putting in the work just like everybody. You definitely did the right thing. -If- you had helped her that would've been the wrong decision and would have made you an AH.", "NTA", "NTA.  Jane had multiple opportunities to learn to code, the fact that she is nearing graduation, has a senior project that she is required to complete on her own by building an application and coding it herself, and is still only contacting you when she needs to cheat. Let's be honest. That's what she is doing and what she is asking you to do.  \n\nI think you're lightly T A for allowing her to cheat off of you for so long, but you're definitely not one for not doing her senior project for her.  How does Jane expect to work in the field if she doesn't know how to code? Is she going to keep contacting you once she is employed to do her work for her? There's a big difference between helping someone learn, studying together, and just outright doing the work for someone else or allowing them to copy off of you (which is cheating and most schools have policies against this).\n\nHonestly, you are better off having declined her. Jane's not your friend. She only wanted to talk to you when she could benefit from your kindness.  I'm glad you finally learned how to say no and to stick with your decision.  I'm also hoping that Jane got a wake-up call and will switch majors. Employers are not going to be happy that she's incompetent when it comes to coding and is happy to steal other people's work as her own. There is no way she is going to be successful in her field unless she actually learns how to code. \n\nPlease, forget about her.  Again, she's not your friend. Jane used you. Don't doubt yourself at all. Jane will have to live with the consequences of not taking her education seriously and failing to put effort over the years to learn how to code (how on earth did she even pass her classes? ). You, on the other hand, should forget about Jane and look to your future.  \n\nGood luck, OP!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re not obligated to help her\u2014 even if you were close.", "NTA she should have dropped out of the subject ages a go tbh. She has not bothered to learn how to code which is an essential part of the course, and should not come close to passing.", "You are under no obligation to help, in fact your previous willingness to help has probably allowed her to get to this position. She hasn't had to learn effectively because she had you. It sounds like it was a one way street, did she return the favour in any way?\n\nEither she finds another helper, actually learns the material, or fails. That is up to her, and how far she is willing to go to finish her degree.", "NTA\n\nAnd I can't stress this enough; *Don't do this!* It's cheating. It's obviously cheating. And if you get found out, you'll both be thrown out.", "NTA\n\nWhat do these people do later, when they're hired as software engineers?\n\n**THE EXACT SAME THING.**\n\nDamn code vampires sit there smugly committing other people's work. Yuck.", "NTA OP, people need to learn that it\u2019s important to do shit themselves because having a certificate or diploma implies that you did the work. If you did her work & then she graduates, she\u2019s gonna learn the hard way that getting others to do her work isn't gonna make herself stand out for employers or managers.", "NTA.\n\nWhat was Jane going to do when she got into the real world? No adult is going to be conveniently placed to help her with the job she gets. She was going to have to face the consequences of her inaction sooner or later.\n\nJane was lazy. And used you, and others likely, to glide through college.", "That\u2019s was so perfect I just spilled my tea", "I believe she would return the favor if she could, but I think she never had the opportunity to. I don't really like asking people for help unless I absolutely need to because I always feel like a bother. I also always tried to help her in a way that would help her learn. For example, I would point out which chapter to read or which problems the professor did in class that showed exactly how to solve a question. But I do see your point. She might have learned to rely on my hints instead of learning the material for herself.", "She might have accidentally helped you, because the best way to understand a subject is to explain it to someone who doesn't.\n\nStill NTA.", "So here's the thing. You feel bad because you refused to commit **academic dishonesty** that would have helped her graduate.\n\nShe didn't ask for your \"help\". She asked you to be a willing participant in her cheating. Spend some time thinking about that. Ask yourself what price you put on your own personal integrity. You spent years helping her cheat *because you haven't learned how to value yourself enough to say \"no\"*.\n\nSuppose you'd written that application for her and she'd passed? Suppose she then manages to get a job on the strength of her degree? It will take them less than a month (possibly less than a week) to figure out that she's not capable of the work that her degree said she could do. And then she'll be out of a job. And she is never going to be able to get and keep a job in this field, because she doesn't know what she is doing.\n\nAnd then you would also have helped devalue your university and *your* own degree, because everyone who ever had the misfortune of working with her, for however short of a period, would have the opinion that your university, and degrees from it, are useless.\n\n(I can say this with some certitude because at a couple of different points I worked with people with degrees, one in Comp Sci and one in Journalism, who were absolutely incompetent, and not only is my opinion of their alma maters and degrees from those institutions shit, I have told other work colleagues about it.)\n\nPLEASE. Do yourself a big favor and learn how to stand up for yourself and say \"no\" to users and takers.", "NTA You should have cut her off a long time ago. If she was in over her head in this field she should have chosen something else. Why should she get credit for something you did? You and your classmates worked hard to pass and prepare for your futures. Now it's her turn.", ">We are not exactly close, but we are on friendly terms. We do not really hang out outside of class except when we're studying together or when I am teaching her something. She also does not text me except when she needs help with homework or studying\n\nY-T-A to yourself for putting up with this for four years.\n\nNTA. How is Jane going to do do her job (if she gets one) if she doesn't know how to code?", "NTA, you did the right thing.", "NTA - you absolutely  did the correct thing.  Its time for her to admit that she can't code.\n\nA degree is evidence that you have applied yourself to X number of project, for 4 years, have met deadlines etc.  It gives an employer the confidence that somebody could be a reliable employee.  she's a cheat\n\nWhat if she got a job and was pulling the same number on coworkers?  How many years does she plan on pulling this?", ">By the time I graduated, she still couldn't code even if her life depended on it.\n\nShe doesn't deserve a degree she didn't earn. You probably shouldn't have helped her as much as you did. Not doing her actual project is completely fine. I'm not sure what would happen to you if she got caught. You graduated from the same university. I don't think they would revoke your degree since you did earn yours but you would burn a lot of bridges. \n\n>She wanted me to code the entire application for her and said that she would write the research paper. All I literally had to do was write code. and she even offered me money.\n\nDoes she understand she's not going to be able to pull this at jobs? I wouldn't worry about this, she probably just found someone else to sucker into it. NTA.", "NTA. If she does not get to graduate, not only would that not be terrible, it would in fact **be perfectly appropriate, because she hasn't fucking learned anything**.\n\nWhat's the point of her graduating without having learned the skills she's supposed to be qualified in? OP, you're prepping for interviews; what the fuck is she going to be able to do in a job?", "This was my question. Like, ok so she passed college. Any job she interviews for will expect her to code properly. And that's not something you can fake or simply learn as you go. What's her long term plan here?\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "She was asking you to commit academic fraud. Plain and simple. Which is a crime that would get her degree revoked if that ever got out anyways. Technically it was already too late as she cheated off you before.", "END LOOP"]}
