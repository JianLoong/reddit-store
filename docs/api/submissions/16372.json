That would have been the decent thing to do and your friend who invited you should have spoke up for you too.", "YTA, you're making a stink over 50$ at your friends party? Why did you even go? Just to show everyone up? Yeah, you sound pretty stingy to me.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get the same things as they did.", "NTA.  You pay for what you consumed, not to subsidize someone's expensive taste in food and drinks.", "This happened to me with a small group when they all has lots of money and did not.  I purposely did not have any appetizers, split a dish with another person and only ordered one beer, while everyone went crazy.  We \u201csplit the bill,\u201d and I was too embarrassed and worried about appearing stingy.  I was secretly pissed.  Ok, lesson learned.  \n\nFast forward to an outing with 2 of the same group who said everyone should split the bill. I was working so had a bit more money. I figured we were splitting it anyway so participated in the shared dishes, and ordered like everyone else.  Bill comes, and she insists on divvying it up bc she did drink anything.  WTF?  Those people sucked and I\u2019m glad they moved away to CA.  This was a long time ago, but I\u2019m still salty about it!!  I get both sides, but flip-flipping like this is true assholery.\n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, we usually split the bill, but I try to note if someone is eating like a bird, or not drinking, etc., and suggest they throw in their fair share based on what they ordered, and everyone who pigged out splits the rest evenly.  It comes up more now bc many now have other obligations and it\u2019s common just to join for a drink, or just dessert, etc.  It helps that we\u2019re older, I know the people I\u2019m dining with better and they aren\u2019t cheap assholes, and people are generally more financially comfortable, so it\u2019s not a real pressure point.", "By what custom should you pay for their food?", "NTA. You did not drink, nor did you order a pricey meal. You should not have to pay for other people's night out drinking. Also, if the decision had been made that the bill was going to be split evenly, they should have said something before the bill came. I'm petty af. I would have ordered another meal to take home and a bottle of wine to drink once I got home since I would not be drinking and driving.", "Really, that's surprising. I've been in a similar situation to ops a few times, but thankfully, everyone used common sense and automatically deducted the alcohol from my portion of the bill.\n\nIf everyone's orders are about the same price, splitting is OK, but so is only paying for what you had. Both options are normal. Sometimes, I'll pay the whole bill and other times my friends will. It just depends on the dynamics of the group.\n\nI've heard of people getting shitty about this before, and it's always the people who order expensive food/drinks who act shocked/offended when people don't want to bankroll their dinner. It's selfish.", "We've had very different experiences then. When I was younger I was all for splitting the bill, reasoning that it would all work out in the end (over time...)  I still use it for restaurants that serve sharing dishes (mostly pizza and asian cuisine.) \n\nThen I met a few people who used and abused the concept of splitting. To the point where my partner and I ended up covering much more than we would have had we paid for our own orders. When the bill triples, I get annoyed. \n\nIt's your \"more or less\" that becomes the issue. \n\nIn OP's instance, we have a case where it should have been clear to everyone there that even splits were simply not fair - yet OP's being criticised for requesting a separate bill at all... \n\nThese days, unless it's with my ex-partner or a few very close friends, I bring it up either as arrangements are made, or at the start of the meal that I'd prefer a separate cheque. And if it's a special celebration, I bring it up BEFORE the event. \n\nI try to live by this: \"Assumption, my dear Mitz, is the mother of all fuckups!\"", "I feel the opposite. If he was the only one not benefitting, why make him pay so much more. He needs to hang out with better people.\n\nAlso, it's not complicated to split the bill. Any restaurant I've gone to notes down what everyone ordered. Taking multiple payments takes a tiny bit longer, but it's not hard.\n\nMaybe they weren't intentionally taking advantage, but it's thoughtless and shitty.", "I would have replied \"oh? I'm sorry you didn't mention that earlier. I'll pay for my own, thanks.\"", "I've never encountered anywhere that didn't allow for separate bills, what kind are you thinking of?", "Fair play - I guess it's not a bad shout if you're out with people you don't know. I've generally taken the view it all evens out in the end but equally I'm not teetotal or a vegetarian so no reason why my bill should always be lower than anyone else's.", "It's absurd to me. I'll pay for what I consumed. The fuck am I expected to pay for everyone else to indulge themselves for? Hard pass", "Seven people celebrating, though? That's more like chipping in for a party than splitting dinner IMO.", "Have been to South Korea several times, and we all paid our own bills. Nobody so much as blinked at that. And yeah, I was eating and drinking with the locals. \n\nAlso...xenophobia is a harsh accusation, and I don't appreciate it.", "I'm going to quibble...\n\nPaying more than your share voluntarily and without discussion is pretty common: the expectation that a split will happen without discussion is the issue here. \n\nStigma associated with spending money in restaurants is bullshit stigma. \n\nAnd finally, every point of sale system out there in the modern world can do a by seat bill split. It's not rocket science for programmers, and it's no less convenient for the patron.", "I spent a decade as a vegan as my partner had health issues. It didn't kill me to do it (I did miss barbecue... everything barbecue) but I assuredly noticed when the \"split\" was being abused. \n\nI much prefer the mode I'm in these days with a few very good friends; we always end up \"you did last time, I think it's my turn\" even when we know full well who paid it the time before... it allows for kindness, generosity and changing circumstance.", "Again, then you must not get out much. Glad you haven't gotten taken advantage of by people who do that, but it is A Thing.", "Of course, I agree. \n\nIt's an engagement celebration, you know? Like, it's not just dinner, it's a once in a lifetime party, and paying for it evenly is not, like, out of the question. OP doesn't give enough detail to really assess motive.", "Yikes. Okay deep breath.\n\nDid we read the same post? OP went to a dinner to celebrate an engagement of a friend. It was an intimate dinner of 7 people. This is a special celebration, once in a lifetime for many, and it is normal to, out of generosity, split the cost of the party evenly among close friends. OP doesn't give much detail but it doesn't sound like anyone else in this friend group was surprised about an even split. This strikes me as a reasonable misunderstanding overall and I rated it NAH\n\nNow you said that if anyone suggests splitting the bill evenly then you never speak to them again. That's a pretty extreme thing to say and why I replied to your previous post.", "Again: you\u2019re being solipsistic, the world extends beyond your selfish moocher friends. FACTS", "One of my sisters was a server at mid to high end restaurants in the US for many years, and I asked her about separate checks (this was years ago). She told me that as long as it was asked before ordering, it was no big deal. Now (with technology in most places), there\u2019s no reason to not be able to tell the server to put X amount on whatever card.", "NTA. She only called you stingy because you didn't pick up part of her (and everyone else's) bill.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't split the bill evenly if other people drank and got expensive meals, I would offer to evenly chip in on the tip, even if it was more than 20% of my meal.\n\nEdited to add- I'm thinking you all don't tip where you live, so I dunno, maybe offer to pay for the engaged couple a dessert instead of chipping in more than your share of tip.", "Eh, it depends on social norms in both your friend-group and country.\n\nIn the US, it is quite common to split tickets by what each person *actually* had to eat/drink. Even here, though, there are some friends who dine together often and splitting evenly works out to be fair in the long-run.", "NTA. No one should ever suggest splitting the bill unless everyone had basically the same thing, and even then, if someone wants to just pay their own, you let them.", "NTA i went to a friend's hen dinner and I am a non-drinking vegetarian, the other girls were eating steak and drinking fancy cocktails. A plate of pasta with tomato sauce and a glass of water cost me \u20ac100. \n\nI don't mind splitting the bride's costs between everyone else, but it's not fair to ask me to subsidise everyone else's excess.", "Info: did you chip in appropriately for tax and tip or are those not a thing in your area? Were there any shared appetizers? I don\u2019t think you should have had to fully split the bill, but I hate when the people only paying for what they ordered don\u2019t actually pay as much as they should because they aren\u2019t including everything.", "NTA\n\nYou should only have to pay for what you ate.", "NTA, in a world of Venmo it makes zero sense to split bills like this. If y'all don't want to bother a waiter with splitting the bill then simply take a picture of the receipt and have everyone pay you their portion+ relevant tax and tip later.", "NTA. My roommate only pays for their shit if a bill like thst pops up.", "NTA. \"Separate checks please\" is my favorite term at restaurants.", "NTA. You should never be obligated to pay for someone else\u2019s alcohol, and it is exceeding unfair for vegetarians- or anyone eating a less expensive meal- to have to subsidize everyone else\u2019s splurge.", "NTA. This is a common problem. Everyone should just pay for their own meals, for real. Especially when the meal and drink situation is vastly different, like here.", "Splitting the bill does not mean splitting it evenly. It means you're just too lazy to do the real math so everyone throws in about what they owe. If everyone has about the same, then sure, just split evenly. When you had way less than everyone else, then you pay less than everyone else.   \n\n\nI say this as the person who usually has above the average of people at the table. That being said, we usually just pay our own bills. Really not sure why that's so hard. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "I have family that always tries to do this with me. Even though I typically get the cheapest thing on the menu (because I don't like meat) and they'll \norder things like steak, drinks, and desserts.

What asshole doesn\u2019t notice that one othe party had a much smaller bill and offer to split by amount?", "I hate beer, but will have whiskey drinks which costs more. For this reason, I get my own tab and my beer drinking friends split their bills. Sure, I could just buy my drinks at the bar and split the meal with them, but this way they don't have to pay for my whiskeys and I don't pay for their beer. I'm sorry if this is extra work on the wait staff, but so far none have seemed put off by it.", "Wow that\u2019s rude.\nI\u2019ve been the friend that orders less but just offers to split the bill anyway, but to be the one to order more expensive and split is really rude", "The main girl's friend failed to see how stingy it is to expect people to pay for things they didn't buy.", ">One thing I can't tolerate though is people who pull out their calculators and suddenly forget that tax and tip are a thing.\n\nMy husband and I have worked for tips since we met and tip well.\n\nI reconnected with a very old friend from when I was a little kid a while back and he happened to come in to town to visit. On his last morning before I took him to the airport we stopped for breakfast at our local breakfast/lunch restaurant. He wanted to pay.

Most meals served in Korean restaurants are communal by default, and it\u2019s still the case that some restaurants won\u2019t serve you if you choose to dine alone (this practice is becoming less common, again due to Western influence, but it still happens). You split the bill evenly because in most situations, you eat the meal equally.\n\nETA: I see your lack of appreciation, and downgrade my comment to xenocentrism.
