I think it\u2019s one thing to say \u201chey we\u2019re gonna split the engaged couples\u2019 meal between everyone\u201d and it\u2019s another to take on the expense of everyone when you didn\u2019t eat/drink as much. I hate splitting bills and I really don\u2019t understand the custom.", "NTA. Splitting the bill evenly only makes senses f everyone's actual totals are the same or close. If there were two of you and the total bill was \u00a3100 where your actual total was \u00a349 and the other person's was \u00a351 and you didn't want to just split it evenly, sure, that's kind of stingy. But when your actual total is less than half the even split amount? Absolutely ridiculous to be expected to agree.", "Nta you did not eat any of the stuff they purchased, when going out always start out by telling the server you\u2019d like a separate bill so they can\u2019t pull this stuff on you", "NTA. For an engagement, I get picking up the brides or grooms check, or splitting that amongst the attendees, but outside of that, separate checks, always.", "NTA. You\u2019re not stingy, and they could see that you ordered less. I agree that knowing yours was going to be a lot less ahead of time you should have told the server. \n\nThe way my friend group does this if we have an outlier in meal price among a large group is to have that person put in what they owe first, subtract that amount from the total and then evenly divide the remainder for everyone else.", "NTA. I have some friends that don't drink and I always suggest we deduct the booze first since it's really not fair on them. Splitting the bill evenly is fine when there's very little difference in it but ultimately your share would have doubled on this occasion. That person who called you stingy is either incredibly entitled or simply didn't do the math.", "NTA. But I am biased.\n\nThis always seems so odd to me. Must be cultural, but whenever we got out, we never split the bill evenly; everyone pays for their own. The servers start by making seperate cheques for people. I cant imagine being asked to pitch in for what others eat, how do you even budget for that?", "NTA they tried to make THEIR bill cheaper by trying to make everyone split it evenly. They were the ones being stingy not you. The only way this could be a thing is if it was some sort of engagement gift to the friend who is engaged where you were all agreeing to split it so that the friend didn't have to pay.

There's no way you should have had to pay more than double what you ate/drank just to pay portions of their bill.", "Did you know that this was a celebration in honor of someone?  Usually that implies that everyone there will be chipping in for the honorees meal.", "NTA. I don\u2019t see why when there is such a big difference. If it was only by \u00a35 or 10 then fine. It that is too much to pay double what you actually owe.", "NTA, I've lost friends over this and it's a hill I will die on. We went out for dinner with like 15 people, some people bought wine and beer, they had meat ect, I was really struggling at the time and was counting pennies. We were all in our last year of uni and it was around dissertation time so I wasn't doing extra work, me and my ex had our own place and we had bills. My total was 7.50 as I had veggie meal and water. They wanted me to pay nearly 20 quid and when I refused one girl shouted at me that the bill needs to be paid, I agreed that it did, but by the people who ordered all the stuff. I was literally going to aldi with a calculator to make sure I was on budget. Don't be paying for someone else's good time", "Interesting how they are so upset about having to pay an extra \u00a37, but you're the one being stingy about not paying \u00a350 more than what you ate. \n\nMy rule of thumb is that if I'm splitting the bill, it only works if everyone's totals are within a few dollars of every one elses. I think this is why some restaurants have a fixed menu for dinner parties and things. The people hosting the party want to make sure that (even though they are covering the cost), all of their guests stay under a max budget per guest. \n\nNo wagyu beef or black truffle grilled cheese please, please stick to a more modest dish, unless everyone agrees to be generous. \n\nNTA", "It's always funny when the ones with the higher bill are mad that the ones with the lower bill won't split evenly.

Not only should you not have to kick in as much for your meal, they made the person being celebrated kick in instead of everyone kicking in for their meal. NTA", "NAH. This doesnt sound like a typical night out with friends and splitting the bill. This sounds like it was either formal or informal bachelor/ette outing. So if thats what the atmosphere was. Its normal to pick up more of the tab so the engaged couple/person doesnt have to. That said. Going forward id just request a separate bill up front and confirm expectations on contributing to the event. I don\u2019t think anyone is really and AH here. Just sounds like a big miscommunication on expectations.", "ESH. They assumed, and you assumed.\n\nNext time announce you'd like a separate bill for your orders, and perhaps that you'll share the newly engaged woman's tab with the others. Do that either during the arrangements-making or when you're seated. NOT after service is complete.", "NAH, I hated it when I\u2019m put in that position as well. I think it felt more painful when I was younger and more income restricted. Now, we are good splitting bills if pretty close or we go with regular group of friends and it roughly evens out over time.\n\nIf it was a large group / noisy venue, people may not have realized you were not ordering at the same level as them.
