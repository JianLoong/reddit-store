Our biological parents are dead. The only reason we ended up split up in the foster care system was because the state made a mistake only removing me from the home before our bio parents died and by the time they realized this the bio parents had fled the state with my siblings.

You can\u2019t set yourself on fire to help someone else and you can\u2019t force your roommate to do so either. Your roommate could also, possible, make a stink with your landlord and get your sister kicked out (and you too, maybe). But even if they don\u2019t it\u2019s just rude to them when they have expressed their opinion. \n\nIf your parents are so insistent on helping her they need to do it themselves. It\u2019s AH behavior of them that they are expecting you to put yourself in an unstable financial situation when they aren\u2019t willing to help (assuming they can, and it sounds like they could since they have two guest rooms). \n\nAlso OP if you do hope to move in with your sister in November and your parents are helping have some sort of written agreement with them. The last thing you need is for them to promise to help and then go back on their word. Preferably you would pay separate rent to the apartment, and they would co-sign for her. \n\nNone of this is your sisters fault or your fault, and her situation sucks, but you can\u2019t help her at all if you can\u2019t support yourself.

It's insane that your parents are being so very aggressive about this with you when they have two available rooms yet are not willing to take your sister in even for a few months. Infuriating. But not at all your fault: you are just not in a position to take her in right now, unfortunately.\n\nI hope that you find some solution. I can tell that you're working hard to help your sister find one.", "[deleted]", "She has no credit or income so if we tried to add her they'd deny her pretty fast, but yea, she does have legal rights and she said no so it's just the whole - what tf do we do with her for 2 months", "Actually, it is fairly common for one or more siblings to be adopted by one family, while others remain in foster care or are adopted by another family, particularly in larger sibling groups. Efforts are made to keep siblings together, but that doesn't always happen for various reasons.", "For context, we were seperated as children - I was the only child placed in foster care and by the time the state realized they fucked up my bio parents had already fled the state with my siblings. They only ended up in foster care later because their parents died.", "Hi I'm adopted! My parents (then my foster parents) were asked to be placed with my baby brother (3ish months old but like 9lbs with various health issues) so they were asked if they wanted an 18 month old. I was placed there, then my big sister was placed with me as well. After the evaluation, they decided to separate my sister and I because she wouldn't eat until I ate, freaked out if she couldn't see food and wouldn't put me down whatsoever. She was basically our mom and could cook food on the stove at 4 for us. My big brother went to a few foster placements and has fond memories of an aunt of mine who loved/still loves him dearly. My baby brother was placed with another couple.\n\nThe state did say that they would build on to the house my parents had then but they declined due to the previous mentioned issues. I locked myself in the bathroom and my sister shoved candy under the door freaking out. My dad opened the door to a blue mouthed toddler who was happily enjoying her candy.\n\nMy older sister and brother were placed together along with another boy. I was placed with my parents who had a 16yr old and once they sent her off to college they sent me to kindergarten. My baby brother was placed in a home with 3 older brothers. Were like 28, 27, almost 26 (me) and 24 (he'll be 25 a couple months after I turn 26). The court ordered the kids keep in contact which we did until my older siblings parents left to FL. But they'd had me alone, my brother and me there as well. And I see my brother a lot if I feel like it. We all keep in contact and still have a good sibling bond.", "Yep, my adopted parents.\n\nUltimately I have a good relationship with her, even if it is over sparse visits and texts/facetime. I am probably closer with her than my parents are, but they have tried to be involved, so it's baffling to me now that they aren't willing to lend a bedroom for a couple months and trying to make me do it when I am unable to.\n\nEdit: For context, we were seperated as children - I was the only child placed in foster care and by the time the state realized they fucked up my bio parents had already fled the state with my siblings. They only ended up in foster care later because their parents died.   \n(My message got wonky sorry so im just slapping my og explaination here)\n\n(My other sibling has other arrangements as she's aged out for a while and doing well - but also cant take her, and my other hasn't aged out yet.

I looked into the fine print myself. Plus, summers and winter break she'd need somewhere to go then as well.\n\nI definitely wish they would too! I would support her in a heartbeat if I could, I'd already considered moving her down - adopting her even (Which is funny because the day I turned 18 her social worker asked me if I wanted to adopt her because I was next of kin, and I was like... no because I'm still in highschool wtf do you expect me to do with a 14 yo. But when I was 20, they said I was too young :') ) I just don't have the financial capacity to take care of the full rent of a 2 bedroom, electricity, her transportation when she does get a job, etc.\n\nIts hard :') Very stressful.  \n\n\nEdit: Didn't consider Govt support - but I will look into if her gov support can transfer states :')", "It's not their kid nor is it a child", "Adoptive.

With that being said, in my country, we do have a better security net but it is also very difficult for young adults just out of foster care to succeed in the transition. Improvements have been made, but there should be even more support and programs.

After a year in the dorms she can apply to be an RA and get free room and board.  Summer camps always need workers.  This is pay and room and board.
