This is usual and has been happening ever since I'm 18. My sister (F21) lives with them at the moment.\n\nI've been talking about this with my therapist - they seem to think I'm the responsible one and they don't trust my sister with anything, and she lives her life as if she were still a teenager. When I told my mom it wasn't fair that I had to look after the house while my sister did nothing and was already living there, she told me I was right and that she would ask my sister \"to help\". I don't think I need to explain that \"help\" shouldn't be the word - I think we both should take equal responsibility.\n\nOne of the dogs is diabetic. He needs to be injected with insulin two times a day, around 9am and 9pm. My sister has never injected him - she doesn't even want to try. So the responsibility is mine - however, it's almost imposible to do this task alone because he always moves and barks and growls. The injection doesn't hurt him, he's always been kind of a grumpy dog. So we always need someone to hold him while the other injects him (and keeps the needle in for at least 10 seconds, which is the hard part). \n\nFirst few days, my sister was nowhere to be seen during the morning and I did my best alone. Later I started calling her or waking her up (she sleeps until 11am most days) and asking her to help me. Thing is, I've been planning my life this last 10 days around this task - I know I need to be home 9am and 9pm every day to do this. She hasn't - she goes to her boyfriend's, a friend's, and if I don't ask her she doesn't really seem to care.\n\nWhat would happen if I acted like her? - like, I had my boyfriends's birthday, and I went late because I had to wait until 9pm - what if I had left, like she has done several times, and left her to inject the dog by her own? I won't do this, of course, because I love the dog and I don't want to harm him in any way. But this isn't fair, isn't it?\n\nSo, yesterday, my sister wanted to go to a concert out of town. I told her she could go, but only if she was home by 9pm to help me. She didn't know if she was going to make it and didn't decide to go until the very same day at the last minute. I was talking with a friend when she texted me \"hey I'm going to the concert, mom says it's fine, I'll be back at 10pm and mom told me it's okay if we wait an hour to inyect him (the dog)\". I was busy and I trusted her. So she went.\n\nShe wasn't home until 1am. She says there was a lot of traffic. I had to ask a friend to hold my dog while I injected him the insulin, and it was OK, but thing is I shouldn't have. My sister should have been here. It's only 10 days she needs to be more responsible and not party/go to concerts.\n\nI've just texted my mom \"next time, I'll schedule a concert the very same day you go on vacation and leave my sister alone to care for the house, sounds OK?\".", "created_utc": 1677418744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11chdx7/aita_for_being_mad_and_telling_my_sister_and_mom/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not easy, but let me be the voice of reason here. Your parents clearly have the ability to pay for a house sitter or a dog kennel. Your sister should be able to be totally responsible for the house at 21. You are trying to be the good daughter and be loving, but they are taking advantage of you. If they are paying you then that's one thing, because then you're basically working for them, but if you're doing this for free then you're actually doing harm by letting them get used to relying on something they shouldn't be relying on. You're giving a drunk a drink. \n\nYour sister needs some serious help. You're parents should be kicking her out or forcing her to get a job and do some chores if she doesn't want to move out, and you need to let them learn the consequences of their behavior. You're being used, and that's not what happens in a loving relationship. You don't need to be a jerk or anything, you're heart is in the right place, but you have a one sided toxic relationship and you're getting walked all over. Learn to say no. They shouldn't be relying on you to go on vacation when your sister is at home, and if they do and they try and make you feel bad then that is toxic and controlling and you need to tell them so.

Im one possible result of what they are doing though Im on the opposite spectrum as her. Instead of partying I stayed at home all the time.

Yes she needs to say no to her parents, but her sister is obviously a lazy bum who does nothing but mooch, so she should in no way be praised for \"saying no\". If she's living there then she should be completely responsible for watching the house when the parents are gone. Are you kidding me? She is 21 for Peet's sake!", "The arrangement was that we both would be working together to care of the house. I mean, first thing they asked me, then I asked why should I go if my sister lives there, and then there was this conversation about them asking her to \"help\" me. So she agreed to help at least.\n\nI'm not even asking her to feed them or take them for walks or anything, I'll happily do that. She just needed to be here 9am and 9pm to hold the dog so I can inject him the insulin. Before the concert we had discussed that it wasn't a good idea that she went - there was no way of being sure she would come back in time. However, at the last minute she decided to go, my mother \"let\" her, and with that permission she went.\n\nI guess having a good time with her friends and boyfriend in a concert was more important than her promise.\n\nBut whatever. I get your point tho - this is definitely a me problem. My sister can do whatever she wants, she's an adult. I can't change her.", "She's not paying rent but it's currently summer here, so she's on a break from college. She had a job last year but she lost it and is looking for a new one.

This would be a great compromise, but sadly it's not feasible.", "But my point is, if it is for a short period of time and the sister is staying with her parents, then is it not expected of her to helo? Don't take this in the wrong way, But I am not from the West and there is not much boundary concept for our parents really. So my question is, either the sister has to stay at her own place and set boundaries or if she is staying with her parents then has to take care of some household duties? Because where we live, we don't move out of our parents house as soon as we turn 18 and we help out with whatever we can. We can't have the best of both options is what I am saying. Hope I am clear.", "The relartionship between her sister and her parents is NONE of OP's business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe parents asked OP, and OP AGREED to do it. So it is HER responsibily. She could have refused, then it would not have been.  ... She is an AH to expect her sister to do the things SHE agreed to do.", "Rights, so she owes your parents chores, whereas you don\u2019t.", "Ahhh yeah. That does make a big difference there.", "No: Especially when someone else had agreed to do it. It is reasonable to let THAT person do it than, just as they promised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" So my question is, either the sister has to stay at her own place and set boundaries or if she is staying with her parents then has to take care of some household duties?\" ... Yes. But refusing to take care of a diabetic dog needing special treatment is a reasonable boundary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We can't have the best of both options is what I am saying.\" .. This is something between the sister and the parents, and THEY seem to be fine with it. So sister CAN have it the way they have agreed on. This has NOTHING to do with the promise OP made to her parents to take care of the dogs. And that promise does not concern her sister, she did not make that promise, so: NOT HER DUTY.", "Okay I understood the point here. Her accepting the tasks is her responsibility and not to be passed on when the other person who has not accepted or promised to take care of them.\n\nThank you for the clear response as sometimes it is really difficult to think in other ways when there is cultural/regional difference on how certain things are perceived!! \ud83d\ude0a"]}
