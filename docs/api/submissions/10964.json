This is usual and has been happening ever since I'm 18. My sister (F21) lives with them at the moment.\n\nI've been talking about this with my therapist - they seem to think I'm the responsible one and they don't trust my sister with anything, and she lives her life as if she were still a teenager. When I told my mom it wasn't fair that I had to look after the house while my sister did nothing and was already living there, she told me I was right and that she would ask my sister \"to help\". I don't think I need to explain that \"help\" shouldn't be the word - I think we both should take equal responsibility.\n\nOne of the dogs is diabetic. He needs to be injected with insulin two times a day, around 9am and 9pm. My sister has never injected him - she doesn't even want to try. So the responsibility is mine - however, it's almost imposible to do this task alone because he always moves and barks and growls. The injection doesn't hurt him, he's always been kind of a grumpy dog. So we always need someone to hold him while the other injects him (and keeps the needle in for at least 10 seconds, which is the hard part). \n\nFirst few days, my sister was nowhere to be seen during the morning and I did my best alone. Later I started calling her or waking her up (she sleeps until 11am most days) and asking her to help me. Thing is, I've been planning my life this last 10 days around this task - I know I need to be home 9am and 9pm every day to do this. She hasn't - she goes to her boyfriend's, a friend's, and if I don't ask her she doesn't really seem to care.\n\nWhat would happen if I acted like her? - like, I had my boyfriends's birthday, and I went late because I had to wait until 9pm - what if I had left, like she has done several times, and left her to inject the dog by her own? I won't do this, of course, because I love the dog and I don't want to harm him in any way. But this isn't fair, isn't it?\n\nSo, yesterday, my sister wanted to go to a concert out of town. I told her she could go, but only if she was home by 9pm to help me. She didn't know if she was going to make it and didn't decide to go until the very same day at the last minute. I was talking with a friend when she texted me \"hey I'm going to the concert, mom says it's fine, I'll be back at 10pm and mom told me it's okay if we wait an hour to inyect him (the dog)\". I was busy and I trusted her. So she went.\n\nShe wasn't home until 1am. She says there was a lot of traffic. I had to ask a friend to hold my dog while I injected him the insulin, and it was OK, but thing is I shouldn't have. My sister should have been here. It's only 10 days she needs to be more responsible and not party/go to concerts.\n\nI've just texted my mom \"next time, I'll schedule a concert the very same day you go on vacation and leave my sister alone to care for the house, sounds OK?\".", "created_utc": 1677418744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11chdx7/aita_for_being_mad_and_telling_my_sister_and_mom/", "score": 750, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So my question is, either the sister has to stay at her own place and set boundaries or if she is staying with her parents then has to take care of some household duties?

Any veterinary pharmacists on this thread?", ">The relartionship between her sister and her parents is NONE of OP's business.\n\nThat's beside the point, and also untrue. As her sister she is right to worry about her sister, and she's right to do her part to help her family. The wrong way to do that is to interject yourself into their lives (breaking their boundaries). The right way to do it is to not enable them, and to give kind words of advice and encouragement when there is opportunity. \n\n\n>She is an AH to expect her sister to do the things SHE agreed to do\n\nWhen giving the dog shots is a two person job and the sister says she'll be home at 10 to help but doesn't get home until 1 AM that's simply wrong. I already stated that OP needs to set her boundaries, not agree to something she doesn't intend to do happily, and that she needs to stop enabling her parents, but that doesn't make her an AH, that makes her a person who is a victim to those who abuse her giving nature. She's 100% right that the sister at home should be house sitting because she LIVES there. She's right that the sister needs some serious help, and that the parents enable her, and she knows that the parents will guilt trip OP if she stops enabling them.\n\nYou're right that OP shouldn't have agreed to do this. That's exactly what I said. But her sister is a lazy AH enabled by her parents, and OP is a victim here.", "Yes, reusing needles hurts.  Just Google images of needles after one use.", "OP is WRONG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer sister did not agree, SHe did. SO the sister does not have to help, but SHe has to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe needs to learn to say NO to her parents, instead of harassing her sister about HER OWN incapability to set boundaries to her parents. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and OP is a victim here.\" .. Maybe. But not of her sister. Her sister has NOTHING to do with her weak personality and her incapability of setting boundaries."]}
