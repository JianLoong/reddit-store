We've been together since 2014, married since 2019. No kids.\u00a0\n\nabout ~4 times per year, my wife has what I can only describe as a rage attack. She has an (untreated) disorder that causes her emotional regulation issues, and she sees a therapist (though not a psychiatrist). They are very frustrating to me. She is functionally \"unreachable\" as she goes through them, and she just... gets mad. At me, obviously, but just everything in her life, no matter if it makes sense or not. It's like her amygdala just freaks the fuck out at a tiny thing (mild conflicting opinion from me, or not being able to find her phone, etc) and pumps out anger hormones.\u00a0\n\nshe returns to a baseline afterwards, apologizes earnestly and honestly, and returns to her normal self. Her normal self has big emotions too, but I almost enjoy them - I don't feel emotions as deeply as her, so it's nice to feel along with her, if that makes sense.\u00a0\n\nthree nights ago, she had one. We had a little disagreement, so I went into the kitchen, and she threw something at the wall and started just *yelling*. She wouldn't let me leave the kitchen. Again there is no reasoning with her when this happens, words mean nothing.\u00a0\n\nI escaped, told her to go to bed, cleaned up the mess she made, and that was \"that\".\n\nThe next day, she came home from work and started apologizing, and I told her that I wasn't really willing for this to happen again, and she has to take action to prevent this from happening. We kept talking and a couple minutes later she said, \"I feel really bad, you know\" and my response was **\"right now, I don't care how you feel. I'm telling you this can't keep going on.\"**\nwe dropped it and moved on.\n\na couple hours ago, she brought up that it was hurtful that I told her I didn't care about her feelings, but I think that's a pretty reasonable way to respond when I was on the floor of our condo cleaning up her rage choices the night before.\u00a0\n\nAITA?\u00a0", "created_utc": 1693612237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167n3n4/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_didnt_care_about/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s decided not to control herself around you.", "NTA\n\nThere is only so much any person can take. You are right: this cannot continue, no matter how she feels in the light of day. You are not her emotional punching bag. You have your own feelings and one of them is that her contrition is not enough. \n\nShe should feel bad. More importantly, she owes it to everyone in her life to STOP these episodes. If she can't, do what you must to protect your own sanity. I'm sorry you are struggling with something so volatile. I hope it gets better soon.", "NTA, it\u2019s gotta be exhausting going through that all the time.\n\nThat being said, if this is a verifiable disorder, there not much you can change if she\u2019s getting proper treatment but it sounds like what she\u2019s doing doesn\u2019t seem to be enough, since you called it \u2018untreated\u2019. \n\nHow come she didn\u2019t understand your response? She wasn\u2019t in her \u2018rage mode\u2019, so surely she has to see how exhausting this is for you? \n\nBe careful, please. This could get violent.", "NTA\n\nShe threw stuff and actively prevented you from moving to where you wanted to go. Apologising later without really doing anything to fix it means zero, so yeah I would also not care about how sorry she felt, I'd only care about what she's doing to make sure it doesn't happen again.", "NTA\n\nWhat you said sounds to me like you have decided to prioritise your own safety and well-being, and that's okay.", "NTA\n\nTwo thoughts: One, your wife is not taking this near seriously enough. Just seeing a therapist for the type of incidents you are describing is like saying you're going to slap a bandaid on a heart attack. Not going to cut it. Sorry. She needs to, at a bare minimum, be under the care of a psychiatrist, and be on medication to control and level her out. I read in one of her responses that she doesn't want to go on meds because she doesn't want the side effects? Too darn bad. She has violent outbursts. She needs to be on medication to regulate herself. If she is not willing to do that, she is saying \"I would rather abuse you, than manage my unstable mental health condition.\" And if that is her position, you need to get out of this relationship.\n\nI also agree with another person who responded that it's notable that she has not been arrested and that these \"outbursts\" do not happen when she is at work. That tells you right there that she DOES have some ability to self-regulate and that these outbursts are not so random and completely uncontrolled as she might like you to believe. If they were completely random, she would be having them at work, too. If they were completely random, she would be having them at the grocery store and getting arrested. Why isn't that happening? I think she is more manipulative than she is letting on. I am not saying you need to get out tomorrow, but I would start setting some boundaries, the first being that her getting in to see a psychiatrist (staying under their care to manage her condition) and staying on meds to control and regulate her moods would be a hard limit.", "NTA she needs help. A psychiatrist. They have meds to help with those issues", "NTA.  Apologies have to come with some effort to do better in the future or they are worthless.  In her case, either a different therapy approach or other coping mechanism has to happen.", "NTA. I think you both need to seek more help for her, the therapy isn't cutting it seemingly.", "NTA  \nAbsolutely reasonable response. That declaration was about you and what you need in order to move forward. What you are going through seems emotionally exhausting and having to care about her feeling bad about her actions, is just another thing she wants to put on you.", "NTA. I think you may be minimizing your own feelings. You say your wife has \"big emotions,\" but that doesn't mean you have none, or that yours are not as important. She does not seem to care about your feelings at all after these episodes.  You were probably hurt and angry (I know I would have been) and just fed up with being treated this way. She needs to get herself under control before you get hurt. I wish you the best.", "I couldn't live with a person like this. NTA do you really want to spend the rest of your life dealing with this?", "NTA. What a terribly sad way to live.", "I n f o: So is there a chemical way to treat this she isn't taking?  If she went to a psychiatrist would they be able to prescribe something that would help?  Is she trying to just power through with good thoughts?\n\nEdit: NTA.  So, she's afraid of how meds will change her- so she's ok with wild rages as long as she feels like herself????  She needs to put whatever effort she has to in order to get a psychiatrist and get on something.  Once on meds doesn't mean forever, it means working with your doctor to find something right for you.  There are things she can try and isn't doing - that is not ok.", "NTA. There's a time when enough is enough. You put your foot down and justifiably so.", "\"I don't care how you feel\" wasn't the most diplomatic way to put it.\n\nBut your wife should listen to the \"this can't keep going on\" part, rather than argue about the way you phrased things. She always apologizes but does she really care about how this makes you feel, or does she think that apologizing makes it okay?\n\nI guess you should apologize for saying you didn't care about her feelings, and then insist that she takes action to treat what looks like mental illness.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "INFO: when she has these rage attacks is she ever threatening toward you? Has she ever harmed you? How do you feel during these attacks and afterward? Do you ever talk about how you feel? \n\nBecause if I was having to deal with someone in an uncontrolled threatening state I would care very little about their remorse if they aren't willing to change anything. Her feeling guilty doesn't trump the crappy situation and her unwillingness to take responsibility. I am leaning N-T-A.", "NTA. You are setting a reasonable boundary. She needs help.", "Info: does she ever get these rage episodes at work? Does she scream and throw things at her friends? \n\nOr is it just you?", "NTA. I can appreciate the way you feel. You are an abused spouse. She could control herself if she wanted to. As someone else pointed out, married, employed, no jail record, no pending lawsuits. She has you conditioned to take her abusive and downright shameful way she treats you. You take, try to make her feel better after the fact, but she can control her rage if she wanted she just doesn't want to. I am willing to bet you don't see her treating anyone the way is treating you. Which is further proof this rage response is not uncontrollable making you a victim even more.", "ESH. Obviously it can't go on and she needs to seek professional help, and her thing is definitely way worse, but you still never, ever, ever tell someone you love \"I don't care how you feel.\"", "ESH, only because it was a stupid thing to say, and it's not true if you love your wife.  You should have said that you understand, but that her feeling bad does nothing to solve the problem or make you feel any better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it was wrong of you to say \"right now, I don't care how you feel\", but the next part \"I'm telling you this can't keep going on\" is understandable. She needs to work on this however she can, both for you and for her. She needs to get some medication to regulate her emotions some more. I also just looked it up, and I think I might know what she **could** have. However, I do not want to say what it is since people often misuse medical information from strangers on the internet which could be dangerous. What I will say is, if she has what I think it is (or something else likely would too) then there are medications that can help. Keep in mind all mental health medications can have serious side effects. As such, if she gets a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist prescribes a medication, it will likely start at a low dosage that may have little to no effect or cause serious side effects. I would suggest she goes to a psychiatrist. I myself have a mental health issue, and I know how difficult it can be to get help, but it is essential that she gets the help she needs.", "NTA.

If that is true, where is your safe place? \n\nIf she does nothing else, at the very least, she needs to walk away from you when she gets like this. She also should be cleaning up any mess she makes.

But the manic episodes were everything from rage to euphoria, wanting to unalive myself to incredible motivation.

I can say, I did find myself more deeply on the other side, even more than when I clung to the highs. I actually have a personality now, if that makes sense.

I'm telling you this can't keep going on.\"**\n\nThese are your own words. You even bolded it.\n\nBut the issue is actually not just this rage thing, but her selfishness in being offended that you feel a certain way about it. Seems she needs you to exist partially to validate her feelings with no reciprocity. \n\nGood luck.", "But that's not okay. The normal number of times per year to scream and throw things at your partner and trap them in a room with your rage is ZERO.", "She could very well cause you to lose your children one day.  Or hurt one of them.  Your minor disagreements trigger her.  There are few things in life more genuinely aggravating at times than toddlers.  Results of her flying into a blind rage could be utterly tragic.\n\nI agree with other posters who advise you to devise an exit strategy.  I think your future with her is far from bright."]}
