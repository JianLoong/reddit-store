We kept talking and a couple minutes later she said, \"I feel really bad, you know\" and my response was **\"right now, I don't care how you feel. I'm telling you this can't keep going on.\"**\nwe dropped it and moved on.\n\na couple hours ago, she brought up that it was hurtful that I told her I didn't care about her feelings, but I think that's a pretty reasonable way to respond when I was on the floor of our condo cleaning up her rage choices the night before.\u00a0\n\nAITA?\u00a0", "created_utc": 1693612237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167n3n4/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_didnt_care_about/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wasn\u2019t in her \u2018rage mode\u2019, so surely she has to see how exhausting this is for you? \n\nBe careful, please. This could get violent.", "NTA\n\nShe threw stuff and actively prevented you from moving to where you wanted to go.

Just seeing a therapist for the type of incidents you are describing is like saying you're going to slap a bandaid on a heart attack. Not going to cut it. Sorry. She needs to, at a bare minimum, be under the care of a psychiatrist, and be on medication to control and level her out. I read in one of her responses that she doesn't want to go on meds because she doesn't want the side effects? Too darn bad. She has violent outbursts. She needs to be on medication to regulate herself. If she is not willing to do that, she is saying \"I would rather abuse you, than manage my unstable mental health condition.\" And if that is her position, you need to get out of this relationship.\n\nI also agree with another person who responded that it's notable that she has not been arrested and that these \"outbursts\" do not happen when she is at work. That tells you right there that she DOES have some ability to self-regulate and that these outbursts are not so random and completely uncontrolled as she might like you to believe. If they were completely random, she would be having them at work, too. If they were completely random, she would be having them at the grocery store and getting arrested. Why isn't that happening? I think she is more manipulative than she is letting on. I am not saying you need to get out tomorrow, but I would start setting some boundaries, the first being that her getting in to see a psychiatrist (staying under their care to manage her condition) and staying on meds to control and regulate her moods would be a hard limit.", "NTA she needs help. A psychiatrist. They have meds to help with those issues", "NTA.  Apologies have to come with some effort to do better in the future or they are worthless.

I think you both need to seek more help for her, the therapy isn't cutting it seemingly.", "NTA  \nAbsolutely reasonable response. That declaration was about you and what you need in order to move forward.

I think you may be minimizing your own feelings. You say your wife has \"big emotions,\" but that doesn't mean you have none, or that yours are not as important. She does not seem to care about your feelings at all after these episodes.  You were probably hurt and angry (I know I would have been) and just fed up with being treated this way. She needs to get herself under control before you get hurt. I wish you the best.", "I couldn't live with a person like this. NTA do you really want to spend the rest of your life dealing with this?", "NTA. What a terribly sad way to live.", "I n f o: So is there a chemical way to treat this she isn't taking?  If she went to a psychiatrist would they be able to prescribe something that would help?  Is she trying to just power through with good thoughts?\n\nEdit: NTA.  So, she's afraid of how meds will change her- so she's ok with wild rages as long as she feels like herself????  She needs to put whatever effort she has to in order to get a psychiatrist and get on something.  Once on meds doesn't mean forever, it means working with your doctor to find something right for you.  There are things she can try and isn't doing - that is not ok.", "NTA. There's a time when enough is enough. You put your foot down and justifiably so.", "\"I don't care how you feel\" wasn't the most diplomatic way to put it.\n\nBut your wife should listen to the \"this can't keep going on\" part, rather than argue about the way you phrased things. She always apologizes but does she really care about how this makes you feel, or does she think that apologizing makes it okay?\n\nI guess you should apologize for saying you didn't care about her feelings, and then insist that she takes action to treat what looks like mental illness.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "INFO: when she has these rage attacks is she ever threatening toward you?

You are an abused spouse. She could control herself if she wanted to. As someone else pointed out, married, employed, no jail record, no pending lawsuits.

You take, try to make her feel better after the fact, but she can control her rage if she wanted she just doesn't want to. I am willing to bet you don't see her treating anyone the way is treating you. Which is further proof this rage response is not uncontrollable making you a victim even more.", "ESH.

I also just looked it up, and I think I might know what she **could** have. However, I do not want to say what it is since people often misuse medical information from strangers on the internet which could be dangerous. What I will say is, if she has what I think it is (or something else likely would too) then there are medications that can help. Keep in mind all mental health medications can have serious side effects. As such, if she gets a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist prescribes a medication, it will likely start at a low dosage that may have little to no effect or cause serious side effects.

Pharmacogenetic testing helped me find an SNRI that doesn't dull my emotions, but allows me to feel a full spectrum of them without the extreme severity of depression.", "Too damn bad for her - she NEEDS to change because her behaviour is abusive.", "Then if she cares, she needs to get psychiatric help.", "Sometimes demonstrating care means taking action though. For example an addict who is very remorseful but continues to use is deciding on some unconscious level that the suffering of their loved one is less important than their own, often because the loved one is shouldering and hiding the pain.  \n\nAs someone who's had mental health struggles amidst other things, I think it's really important you don't let genuine remorse allow her to continue pursuing the same track she has been. You say \"I recognise your apology, however I will no longer pretend I care about your remorse when we both know you will use me as a punching bag again. Show me your remorse by making a change.\"", "You keep saying she\u2019s not in control\u2026 why do you think that? She obv is in control everywhere else. That\u2019s just an excuse she gives you \u2026. \n\nTurn the genders around if it helps. If your mom/sister/woman friend was married to a guy who went into a blind rage every few months, made threats, threw things, and trapped them in a room\u2026. Would you think it was okay\u2026 because they love their wife and can\u2019t help it?", "So you both need a circuit breaker. Talk to her about it but have a clear agreement that if she's that out of control she either lets you have space or you call the police. Not as a punishment or to press charges but to stop this escalating further.", "this is the first time she broke anything or threw anything", "I appreciate this perspective thank you", "Yes, but the once in a great while, controlled rage and apology seems a bit \u201coff brand\u201d for thyroid issues. The big emotions could be explained by it possibly. But it would also come with additional symptoms like fatigue. \n\nWhat a lot of people don\u2019t know is that depression could explain \u201cbig emotional mood swings\u201d and occasional rage. It was something I experienced, but more related when I was actually ON medication. It was the generic meds, time release that didn\u2019t quite work right. By 4pm I was raging. Once I figured that out and tweaked it with my doc, it was much better. \n\nHowever- I never came home from work and started freaking out in a blind rage at my spouse like an absolute maniac without reason.  OP\u2019s spouse needs some serious therapy to get to the bottom of this and he is 100% justified in his response.", "It's the first time she broke anything? So, she's escalating?", "that\u2019s good! nta, i would keep an eye on her behaviour if i were you, and do not ever agree to couples counselling. therapy should be separate.\n\neta: (it\u2019s good that it hasn\u2019t happened before, i mean. the escalating behaviour is \u2026not good. it\u2019s bad.)"]}
