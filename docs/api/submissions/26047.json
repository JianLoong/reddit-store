She wasn\u2019t in her \u2018rage mode\u2019, so surely she has to see how exhausting this is for you? \n\nBe careful, please. This could get violent.", "NTA\n\nShe threw stuff and actively prevented you from moving to where you wanted to go.

Just seeing a therapist for the type of incidents you are describing is like saying you're going to slap a bandaid on a heart attack. Not going to cut it. Sorry. She needs to, at a bare minimum, be under the care of a psychiatrist, and be on medication to control and level her out. I read in one of her responses that she doesn't want to go on meds because she doesn't want the side effects? Too darn bad. She has violent outbursts. She needs to be on medication to regulate herself. If she is not willing to do that, she is saying \"I would rather abuse you, than manage my unstable mental health condition.\" And if that is her position, you need to get out of this relationship.\n\nI also agree with another person who responded that it's notable that she has not been arrested and that these \"outbursts\" do not happen when she is at work. That tells you right there that she DOES have some ability to self-regulate and that these outbursts are not so random and completely uncontrolled as she might like you to believe. If they were completely random, she would be having them at work, too. If they were completely random, she would be having them at the grocery store and getting arrested. Why isn't that happening? I think she is more manipulative than she is letting on. I am not saying you need to get out tomorrow, but I would start setting some boundaries, the first being that her getting in to see a psychiatrist (staying under their care to manage her condition) and staying on meds to control and regulate her moods would be a hard limit.", "NTA she needs help.

I think you may be minimizing your own feelings. You say your wife has \"big emotions,\" but that doesn't mean you have none, or that yours are not as important. She does not seem to care about your feelings at all after these episodes.  You were probably hurt and angry (I know I would have been) and just fed up with being treated this way. She needs to get herself under control before you get hurt. I wish you the best.", "I couldn't live with a person like this.

If she went to a psychiatrist would they be able to prescribe something that would help?  Is she trying to just power through with good thoughts?\n\nEdit: NTA.  So, she's afraid of how meds will change her- so she's ok with wild rages as long as she feels like herself????  She needs to put whatever effort she has to in order to get a psychiatrist and get on something.  Once on meds doesn't mean forever, it means working with your doctor to find something right for you.  There are things she can try and isn't doing - that is not ok.", "NTA. There's a time when enough is enough. You put your foot down and justifiably so.", "\"I don't care how you feel\" wasn't the most diplomatic way to put it.\n\nBut your wife should listen to the \"this can't keep going on\" part, rather than argue about the way you phrased things. She always apologizes but does she really care about how this makes you feel, or does she think that apologizing makes it okay?\n\nI guess you should apologize for saying you didn't care about her feelings, and then insist that she takes action to treat what looks like mental illness.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "INFO: when she has these rage attacks is she ever threatening toward you?

You take, try to make her feel better after the fact, but she can control her rage if she wanted she just doesn't want to.

I also just looked it up, and I think I might know what she **could** have. However, I do not want to say what it is since people often misuse medical information from strangers on the internet which could be dangerous. What I will say is, if she has what I think it is (or something else likely would too) then there are medications that can help. Keep in mind all mental health medications can have serious side effects. As such, if she gets a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist prescribes a medication, it will likely start at a low dosage that may have little to no effect or cause serious side effects.

You say \"I recognise your apology, however I will no longer pretend I care about your remorse when we both know you will use me as a punching bag again. Show me your remorse by making a change.\"", "You keep saying she\u2019s not in control\u2026 why do you think that? She obv is in control everywhere else. That\u2019s just an excuse she gives you \u2026. \n\nTurn the genders around if it helps. If your mom/sister/woman friend was married to a guy who went into a blind rage every few months, made threats, threw things, and trapped them in a room\u2026. Would you think it was okay\u2026 because they love their wife and can\u2019t help it?", "So you both need a circuit breaker. Talk to her about it but have a clear agreement that if she's that out of control she either lets you have space or you call the police. Not as a punishment or to press charges but to stop this escalating further.", "this is the first time she broke anything or threw anything", "I appreciate this perspective thank you", "Yes, but the once in a great while, controlled rage and apology seems a bit \u201coff brand\u201d for thyroid issues. The big emotions could be explained by it possibly. But it would also come with additional symptoms like fatigue. \n\nWhat a lot of people don\u2019t know is that depression could explain \u201cbig emotional mood swings\u201d and occasional rage. It was something I experienced, but more related when I was actually ON medication. It was the generic meds, time release that didn\u2019t quite work right. By 4pm I was raging. Once I figured that out and tweaked it with my doc, it was much better. \n\nHowever- I never came home from work and started freaking out in a blind rage at my spouse like an absolute maniac without reason.  OP\u2019s spouse needs some serious therapy to get to the bottom of this and he is 100% justified in his response.", "It's the first time she broke anything? So, she's escalating?", "that\u2019s good! nta, i would keep an eye on her behaviour if i were you, and do not ever agree to couples counselling. therapy should be separate.\n\neta: (it\u2019s good that it hasn\u2019t happened before, i mean. the escalating behaviour is \u2026not good. it\u2019s bad.)", "you told her you didn't care that she *felt bad* about hat she had done? yta.", "Inb4 she just rage stabs you one day because you ate the last pop tart.", "NTA. Would you want to be separated from her? And reconcile with her when she improves as part of the condition?", "NTA. Seriously, seriously stop and think about what this is doing to you. A partners rage, even if not directly fully at you, profoundly affects you. Do you feel like you need to walk on eggshells? Do you start to feel hopeful only to have her fly into a rage again? Do you feel emotionally safe? \n\nMy response to you is influenced by my own trauma. This sounds like my parents. For nearly 50 years my mom has delt with my dad's \"episodes\" - the rage, the breaking things, shouts that she should just take the kids and divorce him \nor that he should drive his car off a bridge and kill himself, the bashing his head into a wall, then waking up in the morning like nothing happened. At least in your case she apologizes. He is undiagnosed because he refuses to seek help - convinced that medication will cause him to become suicidal. \n\nMy mom is a loving, creative, funny, wonderful woman who has been emotionally crushed by the burden of the mental health issues he refuses to treat. She has developed crushingly low self esteem and has told precious few about what she experiences because she loves him and wants him to get better. Every time his explosions gets bad and she considers leaving, he gets good again and that glint of hope keeps her stuck and \"I mean, he's never hit me or anything.\"\n\nIt breaks my heart to think about how different her life could have been. How different my siblings' and my childhood could have been. I hope, if she refuses to take action, any potential children are reconsidered. \n\nSetting boundaries is loving your wife. Taking a firm stance that this can't continue is loving your wife. If you want to stay with her but want this to end, some things may need to fall apart first.", "Nta if your roles were swapped people would be screaming abuse.... DON'T under any circumstances have kids with her.", "NTA. It sounds like you've been very patient, empathetic, and understanding. Love is love. Everyone has a line, though, and she's crossed yours. You're entitled to have that line/limit. You also spoke up about it instead of shoving it down or avoiding it, which I find admirable. \n\nHold your ground. Reach out to her doc to see what else can be done to find her better/amended or different treatment. I'm not going to advise leaving her bc I don't know your relationship and I do know that it's never that simple. However, you're not wrong for reaching your limit with how much you're willing to take. Her mental health is very important. Conversely, so is yours.", "NTA - you put the qualifier \"right now\" which was an in the moment thing. I think letting her know you do care about her feelings but right there in that moment, she needed to set her feelings aside and listen to you could be what she needs to hear.", "A lot of people here are so quick to condemn her, and telling you to leave her. You stated she's the love of your life. Please go to therapy with her. She obviously needs that. You do need to set boundaries though, but as it's a disorder on her part you can't really \"blame\" her other then that she really needs to seek help.\n\nGood luck to you.", "This woman is an abuser. It will only get worse. Please take steps to protect yourself, OP.", "NTA. this sounds like BPD to me.\nI have it and my rage builds until I blow up then I feel better.\nSounds like the cycles your girlfriend is having\nShe needs to find a less destructive way of getting it out of her system.\nBest of luck!", "It sounds a lot like Intermittent Explosive Disorder..", "NTA. Damn, you married Jan Levinson. She needs to get a grip before she hurts *you*. Or someone else. This is a huge, waving red flag. Just be careful and stay safe in case this escalates further. And as others have said, have an exit strategy.", "NTA.  She knows it will happen and does nothing to prevent it when she can do so.  Talk is cheap and apologies are meaningless, this is intentional behavior.", "NTA. She's being abusive and you're done with it.\n\nAre you ready to end the marriage? If not, why not?", "INFO : what actual disorder was she diagnosed with? \n\nIf it\u2019s bipolar or BPD, specific therapies and medications (i.e. mood stabilizers for bipolar) DO exist. Strategies to control strong emotions also exist.\n\nIt\u2019s generally worrisome that she is hiding behind her illness when all she seems to be doing is escalating abusive behaviour towards you (has she had those \u201caccidents\u201d in other settings such as work or in public?). Has she noticed things have ramped up? Have you investigated why that would be? Honestly if I realized I was being abusive towards my partner because of mood swings, I would desparately want to try and find a solution. Has she made any kind of effort without an outside prompt?\n\nGet a psychiatrist\u2019s opinion if she\u2019s never gotten one.\n\nEdit : I forgot, NTA, good on you for trying to set boundaries.", ">She CAN control this. Wanna know how you know? She doesn\u2019t lose her job bc of her tantrums. She\u2019s not in jail. She\u2019s never been arrested. She can control this. She\u2019s decided not to control herself around you.\n\nSorry but this is bs.  Home is her safe zone.  It's where she feels safe melting down.  Obviously she needs help but saying she can control it is rather ignorant.\n\nPlease get her professional help and a proper diagnosis.", "I just wanted to hop on top comment to say something directly to OP: I think I know what disorder your wife has, because it sounds a lot like a disorder I have. You said she\u2019s in therapy, but doesn\u2019t see a psychiatrist. \n\nThere are no medications available to treat this disorder, but sometimes they can help with some symptoms a little bit. I personally don\u2019t find meds helpful for this disorder, but I take them for comorbid things. \n\nIn my opinion, she\u2019s not doing enough therapy. If she\u2019s just doing once a week individual therapy, it\u2019s clearly not enough. I went part time so I could do more intensive therapy along with group therapy for a while. \n\nThere\u2019s a specific type of therapy that was created just for this disorder, and that\u2019s what I did in group therapy. It changed my life and helped me get my emotions under control. \n\nThe hardest part of my whole mental health journey was confronting my shitty actions and taking full accountability for them. If she can\u2019t see the damage she is doing to you and your relationship and does not have a desire to change, she never will. \n\nAbove all, you need to keep yourself safe. You have to do what\u2019s best for you. If she isn\u2019t willing to pursue more intensive treatment AND be an active participant in said treatment, nothing good will come of your relationship. She\u2019ll get worse and worse and continue to escalate.", "I mean it is a medical condition and out of her control. Has she tried getting help before?", "But isn\u2019t that the point? If she is in fact able to control her behavior and manage her emotions all day and around everyone else, then she could choose to develop the skills to control herself at home.", "Yeah, I agree here.  I am not a therapist, but it makes me wonder if there's a deep-seated trauma that's being triggered here.  OP, maybe look into trauma-informed therapy.", "Shouldn't *you* be able to regard your home as a safe space? \n\nThere's no way she should be allowed a safe space where she's allowed to abuse you without ever having to feel bad, whereas you're not even allowed a safe space that's free of abuse.", "If by \u201csafe space\u201d you mean that she knows she can get away with it there, then yeah", "Maybe by the time she makes it home she isn't able to control it anymore. I'm not trying to excuse what she does, but we all have limits and times when just once more tiny thing just makes it all too much. Her issues sound very cyclic, so it might be something that builds over a few months until she can't contain it any longer. She also might be afraid enough of expressing it that she reigns her anger in tighter and just ends up magnifying it instead. She definitely needs more help than she's getting tho. A therapist alone isn't cutting it and maybe OPs reaction will be a catalyst to getting to the kind of help that actually makes a difference.", "What a toxic reaction. \"Too bad for her\". \n\nIn this story both are the victim. But people love to demonize her, and are quick to condemn.", "This isn\u2019t a newly developed symptom. According to Op it\u2019s an untreated reason.\n\nShe\u2019s choosing to be abusive when she rages like this. Because she has had years of knowing this happens and is a problem and she has not treated it. \n\nShe\u2019s not a victim at all. Mental health disorders suck but treating them is the responsibility of the individual and since she has chosen to not look for effective treatment she is responsible for being abusive to her partner.", "Why are you so against couples counseling?", "Especially since they seem able to afford a psychiatrist and meds.\n\nBut God forbids meds will make her sleepy for some months whilst adjusting to the meds. And tbh, since she\u2019s able to control these outbursts at any other place that\u2019s not OP and her house, I would think she doesn\u2019t need as much medication as needs good psychotherapy.", "Quick to judge again.", "Couples counseling doesn\u2019t work if there\u2019s abuse.", "Hon, your wife is being abusive. She may not mean to, she may have a medical condition that is behind this. But if she is not actively choosing to seek out help for the times when she is abusing you, then she is failing you as a partner. \n\nHer mental health may not be her fault, but it IS her responsibility and I say this as someone who has both been abused in the past but also have my own mental health issues that I work on so that I don't take it out on the people I love.\n\nYou do not deserve to be abused and nor should you accept abuse, just because most of the time she's great.", "Yeah we\u2019ll those few times a year may kill you next time and then those heartfelt and genuine interactions won\u2019t matter. You sound like you\u2019re looking at this through rose colored classes. She needs mental help and while no it\u2019s not easy on the inside but, you tolerating this just because you love her is gonna make it even more difficult when shit hits the fan and now she\u2019s 50-1-50\u2019d. You can love her from outside too ya know.", "Yea I'm sure she has a deep well for you to stick around \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "the violence is escalating. first time she's thrown something. where is this going to end?", "You deal out your judgement so very easily. Do you also have some sympathy to spare?", "yep. it just gives the abuser another avenue to control and manipulate their partner. to be fair, individual therapy also doesn\u2019t work on abusers, unless the therapist is a specialist, but it\u2019s less harmful if the abused partner is not part of the abusers therapy.", "I have been in a similar situation myself. I\u2019ve been prescribed medication and psychotherapy. I know how it feels to have intrusive thoughts and act on them because you can\u2019t control yourself no matter what. And when you have that, you can\u2019t really control when they happen, be it in your home, a park, the grocery store or a psych ward. \n\nI have sympathy for people that are willing to change for the better. She clearly doesn\u2019t. Prescribed meds don\u2019t critically alter your personality, they balance your chemistry to give your body what it\u2019s lacking (some hormones, inhibitors to keep random outbursts in check\u2026), it\u2019s no different to taking insulin when you\u2019re diabetic. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t be afraid of change, but if she were truly sorry (and she, in fact, knows and is in decent control of what is happening to her) she would try and change. She has a problem and she should get help."]}
