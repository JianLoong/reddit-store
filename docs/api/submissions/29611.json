When we were 12 my father was taking my sister \"Clara\" to lacrosse practice. My dad got into an accident, a drunk driver, killing him instantly. She was a complete wreck after this, and I became her rock. She blamed herself because she hated lacrosse she only played it to get in good with the popular girls in our class. She felt extreme guilt over it, and I tried to help her through this. She nearly dropped out of school, and barely finished 6th form (high school equivalent in UK).\n\nI had no time for anything but school or my sister and devoted myself to her and my schooling.  My sister on the other hand fell in love with \"Matt\" (34M) shortly after graduating. She fell pregnant and they married shortly after.\n\nClara gave birth years ago to a son we'll call \"Carl.\" (12M) Carl seemed to be a slow starter in everything, he didn't even speak until he was 4. After tests it was revealed he is on the autism spectrum and will likely not be high functioning for his entire life. He is very destructive and has a meltdown whenever he doesn't get his way. Due to to the damage he has inflicted to theire home and the therapy he requires Clara has had to take a part time job.\n\nI and my partner \"Liza\" (30F) are childfree, but we happily agreed to help her with babysitting while Clara works. it is only a few hours, usually 2-5 on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. I work from home and Liza works the night shift so this isn't a great problem. Liza works as a behavioral psychologist for kids, she's seen many kids like Carl. I also googled appropriate ways to interact with Carl, coupled with her advice. We've got a working relationship with him and his meltdowns have tapered to minimum.\n\nRecently though he's started to fuss and get loud whenever he leaves my home. Clara tells me she cannot handle him after h comes back from our house. Recently Clara was complaining how she had to decline a shift because Matt is going to a training seminar. I said of course she doesn't have to decline, I and Lisa can take care of Carl. She said my \"influence wasn't necessary\" and it would only cause more problems. I asked what she meant and she said Carl would always scream that Auntie would always let him do this or that.I gently reminded her she could use the same techniques I and Lisa do, but she blew up at me and said it's way easier for me to be the \"cool parent\" because he is only there for a few hours and I don't have to deal with him all day. I lost my temper and said maybe it means something that a person other than her can get Carl to behave. She started screaming at me, and called me an asshole for backseat parenting.\n\nMy family has blown up my phone saying I don't know true parenting. I'm wondering if I really did underestimate, and if I overstepped my bounds, when I have fairly little contact with Carl.\n\nEDIT: I do not spoil Carl, I have a fairly strict set of rules, where if he does chores and homework he gets tablet and video game time. Also since Lisa and I have odd work schedules and can't cook regularly we often order takeout foods which he doesn't get at home.", "created_utc": 1698194391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fs8l7/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_can_leave_her_kid/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is normal for them to meltdown and lash out at their \u201csafe person\u201d upon returning to their care. If Carl is doing chores and homework while with you and that is not the norm while at home - that would be considered masking. If he is able to articulate his frustrations to your sister once he has had his meltdown and is feeling less overwhelmed, then to me, it sounds like he has a pretty spectacular support system in both your sister and her husband. At the end of the day, those few hours you spend with Carl every wk isn\u2019t an accurate representation of what life is like with an autistic child. Sincerely,  Mum of a PDA Autistic Child.", "NTA, you were kind enough to spend the time learning how to help the child cope in his world and you had the expertise of a professional who actually deals with this regularly help you even further.  Not being a biological parent doesn\u2019t mean someone is instantly ignorant about children.  She just bit the hand that was helping her.  Try not to be too distressed, she has chosen this route out of jealousy and there is nothing you can do about it.  Her child was happy at your house because the child felt communicated with.  She noticed it when she picked her kid up and that when she came in the door everything was fine. You had mad progress she hadn\u2019t been able to achieve.  She prob was just giving in to the child\u2019s demands rather than trying to learn how you did so well and is doing more harm than good in the long run.  The child is the one that will suffer from his mother\u2019s ignorance.  I wish you all the best.", "It is true that parenting is about more than 9 hours a week, but it\u2019s also great that you provide free childcare for a child that would probably not be accepted at most daycares.\n\nIt\u2019s possible your sister hasn\u2019t mentioned any of her frustrations because she doesn\u2019t want to mess up a good thing/upset you, but, if she hasn\u2019t asked you to avoid certain things, it\u2019s not fair of her to suddenly act like you\u2019re ruining everything. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible she was having a really rough time of parenting a child with special needs and hearing you imply that it\u2019s easy or that you\u2019ve got it down has to rub her the wrong way. It\u2019s very normal to have some easy moments with kids and to think you\u2019re a professional at parenting. Actual parents do it all the time, just with enough access to a kid to get the humbling afterwards. So, NAH.", "NAH. I think everyone could use a break from the situation, and some breathing room. For what it's worth, autistic kids saving their worst for the primary caregivers is extremely common.", "Special needs mom here: this is ESH in my opinion.\n\nWhen it comes to transitions, discipline, and boundaries, I think it\u2019s his mom\u2019s job to tell you what they are and how to effectively keep things consistent. Consistency is key, like an \u201call for one and one for all\u201d deal. That\u2019s what evals, therapies, IEP\u2019s are for. When adults aren\u2019t on the same page regarding a SN child, the child suffers most. Let\u2019s give your sister a swat on the hand for not communicating that well enough to you. \n\nBut also, she\u2019s not doing this to make you feel bad. It\u2019s for you to understand the reality of raising a child with autism. Where he\u2019s at on that spectrum, well you don\u2019t mention that, but it doesn\u2019t matter-whatever you\u2019ve been doing to help him out at your home to makes things easy for YOU is clearly different than what she uses at home. You need to understand that if you\u2019re a fun person and fun space without structure, he WILL struggle outside that bubble. Your house is Disneyland. Of course he\u2019ll struggle to leave. Do you not help out in that at all? You get to step back and watch, I take it. And it doesn\u2019t even mean you\u2019ll deal with the continuous fall out of it bc you give him back and it\u2019s over for you.\n\nYou\u2019re child free by choice. Great, but \u201cgetting him to behave\u201d is what child free people say in regards to training animals and pets. Parents raising children-let alone one on the spectrum, we can\u2019t just take a class and get a bag of treats at the end. We\u2019re constantly learning and adapting, stumbling and getting back up, and you will never know what it\u2019s like, as long as it\u2019s your choice. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to continue to watch ANYONE with autism, you need to educate yourself on what to expect, and how your actions and treatment of him affect everyone, whether you like it or not.", "soft ESH As the parent of a special needs child they do act their worse (as any kid) at home.  I had teacher always telling me how much better the child acted in school.  It is a different environment and the teacher is not their soft place to land. That being said my husband and I took more than one parenting class because things that works with our other two certainly did not work with this one.   I hope you show her this because taking the classes help so much and everyone could use help.   Second I hope maybe you keep offering to watch Carl but refrain was saying how much better you and partner are at this.   Unless you have a special child 24/7 you will not understand this.", "Yta", "YTA - you pretty much shamed your sister and told her she was a bad mom. \n\nKind of makes you an AH.\n\nAlso the addition about your sister\u2019s mental health issues when your father died doesn\u2019t seem relevant to her as a mother?", "NTA\n\nBut I didn't know nightshift for behavioral psychologist was a thing. Is it in a hospital or something?", "YTA\n\nYou and Lisa are making Clara look like a bad parent to her son, when in reality she tries her hardest to take care of Carl. If he's doing bad after he comes back to Clara's after spending time with you and Lisa, then she's right, he's going to act out more and be harder to handle. While you didn't mean to, you still did a very bad thing to Clara. You should apologize to her and try to help her more with Carl.", "[deleted]", "NTA If I were your sister, I would be grilling your partner and taking tons of notes as well as spending time with the both of you to learn how to make mine and my son's life better.  But that's just me.  You and your partner are awesome women.", "YTA. You lax attitude toward the child led to problem for your sister when he was under normal rules in her house. Instead of asking you to handle her child properly, she found other way so she doesn't have to inconvenience you.\n\nAnd you yell at her in return.", "Soft YTA. Kids, on the spectrum or not, typically behave better for other people than they do their parents.   That doesn't make you capable of doing what she does 24/7/365 with the same results you currently get. \n\nHowever she should be open to the fact that some of the approaches you two use could be beneficial.", "NTA. Your sister has complete control of the situation. If she doesn't like what you do then she can stay home with him. Or have somebody else take him.
