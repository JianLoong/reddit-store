When we were 12 my father was taking my sister \"Clara\" to lacrosse practice. My dad got into an accident, a drunk driver, killing him instantly. She was a complete wreck after this, and I became her rock. She blamed herself because she hated lacrosse she only played it to get in good with the popular girls in our class. She felt extreme guilt over it, and I tried to help her through this. She nearly dropped out of school, and barely finished 6th form (high school equivalent in UK).\n\nI had no time for anything but school or my sister and devoted myself to her and my schooling.  My sister on the other hand fell in love with \"Matt\" (34M) shortly after graduating. She fell pregnant and they married shortly after.\n\nClara gave birth years ago to a son we'll call \"Carl.\" (12M) Carl seemed to be a slow starter in everything, he didn't even speak until he was 4. After tests it was revealed he is on the autism spectrum and will likely not be high functioning for his entire life. He is very destructive and has a meltdown whenever he doesn't get his way. Due to to the damage he has inflicted to theire home and the therapy he requires Clara has had to take a part time job.\n\nI and my partner \"Liza\" (30F) are childfree, but we happily agreed to help her with babysitting while Clara works. it is only a few hours, usually 2-5 on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. I work from home and Liza works the night shift so this isn't a great problem. Liza works as a behavioral psychologist for kids, she's seen many kids like Carl. I also googled appropriate ways to interact with Carl, coupled with her advice. We've got a working relationship with him and his meltdowns have tapered to minimum.\n\nRecently though he's started to fuss and get loud whenever he leaves my home. Clara tells me she cannot handle him after h comes back from our house. Recently Clara was complaining how she had to decline a shift because Matt is going to a training seminar. I said of course she doesn't have to decline, I and Lisa can take care of Carl. She said my \"influence wasn't necessary\" and it would only cause more problems. I asked what she meant and she said Carl would always scream that Auntie would always let him do this or that.I gently reminded her she could use the same techniques I and Lisa do, but she blew up at me and said it's way easier for me to be the \"cool parent\" because he is only there for a few hours and I don't have to deal with him all day. I lost my temper and said maybe it means something that a person other than her can get Carl to behave. She started screaming at me, and called me an asshole for backseat parenting.\n\nMy family has blown up my phone saying I don't know true parenting. I'm wondering if I really did underestimate, and if I overstepped my bounds, when I have fairly little contact with Carl.\n\nEDIT: I do not spoil Carl, I have a fairly strict set of rules, where if he does chores and homework he gets tablet and video game time. Also since Lisa and I have odd work schedules and can't cook regularly we often order takeout foods which he doesn't get at home.", "created_utc": 1698194391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fs8l7/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_can_leave_her_kid/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to understand that if you\u2019re a fun person and fun space without structure, he WILL struggle outside that bubble. Your house is Disneyland. Of course he\u2019ll struggle to leave.

Your sister and her home is safe for him, which is why she gets all his meltdowns. ASD meltdowns can be incredibly full on and it sounds like he has one everytime he leaves your house. Your sister is overwhelmed, and you basically told her you are better at parenting her son. \n\nIt's great that you help out with babysitting, but while moderating his behaviour with takeout and an ipad works for you for 3 hours, it doesn't mean you are better at managing her child. YTA", "It's funny how the NT and Autism Moms(TM) this all thinks that OP is an asshole while the grown ND people don't. Food for thought.", "YTA you give him take away pretty much every time he's there ? ? Obviously he prefers it at your house but that's not an appropriate or healthy way to feed a child.", "Here are my thoughts as an autistic person, and you might not like them, but please listen c carefully.\n\nFirst of all, NTA. Definitely. Now..\n\nAutistic people don't have meltdowns because we \"don't have our ways\". We have meltdowns because when our very essentials needs aren't met and we can't otherwise communicate. For most people, those needs might be completely unseen, or not seem essential; but remember, *we have different brains.* So as much as I understand the perception, it's like that. We aren't brats or immature for having a meltdown, simply what's to you nothing at all can be perceived as extreme for us because our brain is wired differently, so our senses are reacting differently. We literally *feel* that stuff and sometimes, things that go unnoticed by others can *hurt* us. This is very important. This person might never have a voice of their own, so I speak for them in saying this, so do other high functioning autistic adults.\n\nWith that out of the way, there's the fact that your sister is highly traumatized. Autistic people are extremely attuned and sensitive to others and the world. Unfortunately, I grew up with traumatized parents and had meltdowns that they weren't able to take care of, so they too ended up having meltdowns - *remember that autism is genetic, too. At least one of the parents is could very well be autistic as well. I don't know if your sister could seeing you don't seem ND and she is your twin. Would that still be possible? I dunno.*\n\nMy guess is that, simply, you are a better guardian for this kid right now because she's burnt out. You know how to help him to control his meltdowns. You know to let him exert his special interests which is essential to us.\n\nAnd his mom, who's controlling - like a lot of autistic kids moms - and who felt all the guilts for all those years, and who have all this trauma, she doesn't want that. Having said that, lots of neutorypicals will judge me for saying this but this is my gut feelin :\n\n*She knows that her kid feels better with you but she won't accept it.*\n\nThere, it is said. I only say this because Carl specifically doesn't want to go home. That's pretty telling, isn't it? That's no different than any other child on that matter. Telling his mom is just very autistic-like, we are too directly honest for our own good.\n\nHaving said that, plenty of kids will say they like their aunt of uncle or cousin better after coming home. Still, seeing that you really weren't a \"cool auntie\" who doesn't care about homework and stuff...\n\nAlso, she probably tricked your family into thinking you're the bad guy, which is unfortunately typical of a trauma-bound relationship. I only hope you can sort it all out.\n\nWhatever happens, remember that autistic kids are can unable to function and stay unhappy often because of trauma-bound parenting, which is a result of both untreated and unresolved trauma and guilt pushed on parents of autistic kids.\n\nYou're given her much needed relief and she needs to be a better mom. Plain and simple. I am absolutely certain Carl wants nothing more in the world than to feel better when he is at home.\n\nHelp him, and help your sister. Have a thorough discussion with her. I don't know exactly how to help you, but I have a gut feeling that this kid isn't happy at home right now, and her not taking the breaks she desperately need will only make much worst.", "YTA. You really don't know what it's like to parent him. You just babysit.", "carl thrives under you care. what is wrong with that. i dont get it. NTA", "NTA\nYour sister is so focused on Carl seemingly preferring your home and the environment there rather than on the bigger issue - is she applying any certified and professional expertise to how she cares for Carl. Regardless of where he falls on the spectrum, it's common for children on it to dislike their environment changing. If you foster an environment where he feels safe and can safely explore his interests with boundaries and rules he understands, I don't get why your sister is more focused on \"I can't handle him\" and not asking \"what do you do to help my son and how do I do that too.\"\n\nYou may not get the brunt of what comes with raising him, but you acknowledge that when you first started watching him, he had the same behavior towards your household that he had at his mother's. Again, NTA and next time you speak to your sister, ask her why she's so focused on how it effects her rather than on how it effects her CHILD. \n\nYou as the aunt shouldn't be the one more focused on him and his comfort - that's her kid and if she wants to play the \"I have him full time and you don't\" card, press her further and find out if she and her husband actually foster a healthy environment for a ND child - it doesn't sound like they do if the rules are so vastly different and his meltdowns are deemed something they can't handle (and that bothers me because it sounds like your sister is viewing them as TANTRUMS rather than a proper meltdown from being over or under stimulated or overwhelmed).\n\nAdd On - she acknowledged you as a parent, tell her as much because calling you the \"cool parent\" means you have far more involvement than she wants to give you credit for.", "I\u2019m glad you described her previous trauma. She may not want to let you down again. She maybe so scared of losing your good opinion, her fear turned to anger because she\u2019s at the end of her rope. \n\nI only know you are NTA.  Just tell her she is your super hero for all she has been able to achieve even with her incredible trauma. Reassure her she is amazing, strong, and kickass. \n\nRemind her of her badass self. Offer her a break longer than a few hours to just be her for a day. She really really needs it.", "The last thing an autistic kid with difficulties coping needs is a disruption of their routine.", "I fully agree. \n\nCarl would not tell his mom that he liked auntie better unless he felt very secure with his mom. Kids save their worst behaviour for their nearest and dearest. \n\nAbsent any evidence that mom isn\u2019t doing a good job, I think it\u2019s arrogant in the extreme for OP to think she manages Carl better because she googled some things. I also think mom is being a bit of a jerk for blaming OP for Carl having difficulty with transitions. Transitions are hard for most kids, especially autistic kids. \n\nESH", "I agree with most of what you've said but not with your conclusion. I'm also parent to a special needs child and yes, he acts differently with me and let's all his feelings out when it's just us. But I've worked extremely hard to learn what he needs and how to support him to develop the various skills he struggles with. \n\nHe can pretend to be OK and follow rules with others but there's always a limit before he starts acting out. He rarely acts out with me cause I see the warning signs and address the underlying need proactively. For example, I see him getting more easily frustrated with his play so I run through my checklist of whether he might be hungry, tired, need specific sensory input, need quiet time, etc. Then I get him what he needs and he settles without a meltdown. \n\nWhen my kid does well with others, my first instinct is to ask how they're handling things with him. Much of the stuff they do won't work if I do it, but I've learned a few things that have been really helpful and built them into our life. He's more compliant when there's social pressure, but I don't count with that so it doesn't work at home, for example. But certain boundaries hadn't occurred to me and made a huge difference for him. \n\nOP you're NTA. Your sister is feeling inadequate but it doesn't seem like she's putting in the effort to learn from you to see what strategies might work for them. I get that it's an ego hit, but being the best parent you can be requires humility and willingness to learn, especially when it comes to children with divergent needs. It is different when you're with them all the time and it's exhausting, but it's also powerful if you do it well. I hope your sister comes to realise that she can be a better and happier, less stressed parent by accepting help from people who have tools she doesn't yet know how to use", "Autistic adult here...\n\nAll children behave better outside of home.\n\nBut Carl doesn't want to go back home. \n\nThat's as telling as any other children. A traumatized, burnout mother who doesn't know how to help with his meltdown, and OP, who is in those conditions better at it, and let him explore special interests, which really people have *no idea* about unless they are, themselves, autistic.\n\nOnce again, autistic adults have to raise their voice for an autistic kid. This mother need more support and needs to accept that therapy for herself might be needed to relieve her trauma and the guilt society had put on her shoulders.", "Obviously it's quite individual but my son has autism and the psychologist he saw recommended keeping everything as similair as possible wherever he goes. So the same rules, key physical objects (like his water bottle) and schedule whether he's at home, staying with family or at school.\n\nShe said that every young child struggles to some degree to transition to different environments but that it's even more difficult for neurodivergent children. Especially if they get lots of what they want in one place (say takeaways) but don't get as much in another (like more healthy meals at home).\n\nIt's also possible that sensory overload from your house may kick in once he's back in a settled environment, OP. There's been many times my son has been excited and happy to experience new things in the moment but has had a meltdown as soon as we get home while he's processing all that new information.\n\nI'd also agree with a lot of people's sentiments that spending a few hours a week with a child who has autism is not going to give you a true reflection of that child. For example my son attends school part time and his teacher is adamant that he's barely verbal, but he speaks in full contextually correct sentences at home. He just finds speech hard so he ditches it when he's processesing interactions with his peers, focusing on lessons etc.", "Do you think she's just been guessing for 12 years?", "I'm talking about the adults in the situation.", "Little reminder, as an autistic adult.\n\nWe tend to be so face-value honest that we can tell someone we could feel insecure with, that we are indeed, insecure.\n\nRemember this kid has zero notion of social cues on anything.

People also forget that autism is genetic... ya know.", "Some parents do the research, especially those that use their kids NDs as a \"boost\" to themselves, but don't put it into practice all the time. I was unfortunately one of those kids who's parents did this. It was horrible and scarring.

It didn't. It was biased shit information that actually hurt our relationship way more than helped anything.", "You'd be surprised by how many parents just don't bother with the research and trial phase of finding what works best for a special needs kid. Ranging from autism, to ADHD, to anything really - you'll find that most parents tend to NOT utilize any recommendations from professionals or even bother with seeking one out beyond an initial diagnosis.", "Thank you! This is an important insight!", "As someone who has worked with autistic kids and have autistic cousins I was raised with, Carl saying that most likely isn't about getting whatever he wants.

You're making it seem like OP is spoiling him when they're not - Carl is just in an environment where he feels safe and heard.

You ***are*** the \u201ccool aunt\u201d. *Period.* I don\u2019t know why you think you\u2019re anything but and where the hell you get off losing your temper over a **true statement**. \n\nYour arrogance that you are anything but the \u201ccool aunt\u201d and that you could actually handle the real shit 24/7 is why I\u2019m not saying E.SH. This is clearly YTA. You need to check your crappy superior parenting attitude. You want to be a parent? Then have kids. Otherwise stay in your lane and accept that you are **NOT** in any way a better parent to someone else\u2019s child, you are the \u201ccool aunt\u201d get tf over yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou did your due diligence to learn the best way to work with Carl--something she could do as well. Yes, you spend less time with him compared to her, but that doesn't mean your input is worthless. Clearly, Carl is responding to something you all are doing, and I think mom is upset about *that* because she is not able to get him to do what she wants him to do*.*", "YTA-  it really sucks when people tell you how to parent your child. Yes you are helping it that does not give you license to criticize her. I know you said gentle. I guarantee you it didn\u2019t feel that way to her. It sounds like she\u2019s trying her best. \nAnd I imagine you\u2019ve tried helping several times before and this was the last straw.\n\n\nAnd I say this as a mom to a pretty unruly kid. And has a sister too that loves telling me how to parent. \nIt does come from a loving place I\u2019ll say that. Still annoying as hell", ">Carl specifically doesn\u2019t want to go home. \n\n\nReally? Where was that said? \n\nYou should try sticking to the facts that have been shared instead of *whatever this* is. I can\u2019t even count the amount of insane *awful* assumptions you\u2019ve made that have nothing to do with the mom and son and everything to do with *your own trauma.* Calling someone a controlling trauma laden burnt out mom because their kid has a meltdown is an extraordinarily disgusting thing to do ***particularly*** when you know **NOTHING** about the mom in question.", "You literally don\u2019t know **any of** that. You\u2019re just going with the \u2018explanation\u2019 that fits your desired narrative that OP is a better \u201cparent\u201d and mom is bad. \n\nIt\u2019s also just as likely that OP is spoiling the kid. She\u2019s obviously allowing him to do things that aren\u2019t allowed at home and **that** is a problem in and of itself that you just want to ignore and act like it\u2019s okay for babysitters to alter rules and restrictions to make their life easier."]}
