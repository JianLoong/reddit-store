BUT, had anyone brought this up to him before you yelled at him, giving him a chance to address it? Some people are impulsive speakers and not socially aware enough to realize that they are dominating the conversation and stuff. He probably felt super humiliated when you said that and a bunch of people laughed and agreed with you.

You sound like you've been socialized to think that a public addressing of an issue is rude or uncalled for.

And also that cis men are often socialized to speak over and loudly voice their opinions or do this devil's advocate thing as a kind of game.
