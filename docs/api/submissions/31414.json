Hard pass", "This 100%. The failure in communication is going to lead to hard feelings regardless. IMO I\u2019m not the guy with a camper and nowhere to put it, that was his mistake. I also think no reasonable person would ask to camp in your yard by way of asking to park the camper there bc of high lot fees at the campsite, especially this time of year.\n\nAny reasonable responsible adult would have asked and clarified the obviously large burden of using my yard like his retirement vacation spot. He\u2019s in his days of fishing and relaxing, but who would assume to live out their retirement days squatting in their sons yard. Just ridiculous. Consider I\u2019ve spent a decade across the country and \u201cjust brought his daughter home\u201d, like dude she\u2019s 30 minutes away chill out with the \u201clet\u2019s camp in the yard\u201d\n\nI keep saying yard bc the 4 acres don\u2019t mean much when he\u2019s gonna be right behind the house. It started when he\u2019s like, oh I can run some power right to the edge of your land so you won\u2019t have to see the trailer, like bro that\u2019s 1/4 mile your not gonna just run some cord that way to power a camper.

I wouldn't have a large dog leaving large poops in my yard and wouldn't want it running and making noise all over nor the man making noise talking to it. I have cats but even if I had no pets I wouldn't want all that ruckus and if I had a dog it still wouldn't matter because my dog would be trained to my preferences and anyone else's would still be an annoyance. Four acres is alot when it comes to mowing but it's not much when it comes to noisy jerks. How is your wife ok with this?", "Then he'll want to take an enormous moose dump in your toilet, destroying your plumbing and flooding your house, ruining your flooring. Then, since you need to do so much work on your house anyway, you might as well build a big moose room on while you're at it. \n\nI made up that part of the story,  but OP's FIL probably has similar plans. He's going to be like Cousin Eddie, emptying his \"shitter\" into your storm system.", "She is just being hyper defensive bc of the situation that I am asking her to deflate.
