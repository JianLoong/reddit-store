He still lives in his room that he has had from childhood.  \n\nI love my son but I am tired of supporting him.  My wife won't let me charge him rent or make him pay for groceries.  She still does his laundry.  \n\nHe took a year off after high school to relax.  But he didn't go anywhere.  He did not get a job or anything.  He just sat at the beach for a year.  \n\nWe paid for his university.  He graduated when he was 22 and got a job right away.  And he has wasted all his money.  He has a truck that costs as much as we paid for our house 25 years ago. I am not even going to get into how much he spends on his computer and other hobbies.  Him and my wife have turned his sister's old room into his Lego room.  He also lost a bunch of his savings on crypto. \n\nI am getting close to retirement and I think I should not be supporting him any more. But my wife won't let me kick him out.  It is becoming a real issue with us.  \n\nI approached my wife last week with the idea of selling the house and moving south.  She won't hear of it and called me cheap and miserable for wanting to abandon her \"baby\".

You have an adult son who behaves like a 16 year old, and an adult wife who enables this.     I'm not sure what you mean by drastic, but you have every right to have him move out, or move out yourself if you and your wife are not on the same page.    \n\nI do suggest having a firm but civil conversation with your wife, explaining that you won't be around forever, and he had better learn sooner rather than later how to take care of himself.  Also, you will not tolerate this living situation, and if the son doesn't leave, she will have to decide which man she wants to live with, as it can't be both.", "Nta.\n\nI don't think it's automatically weird when adult children live with their parents... HOWEVER, the adult children at least offset their costs (utilities), pay rent, buy their own food, DO THEIR OWN LAUNDRY, help clean/maintain the home, etc.  One of my siblings ended up, for various reasons, staying home until they were hust over 30, but it was more of a roommate situation. \n\nAnd they did their own damn laundry.", "NTA - Why would he leave? He has just about the easiest possible life. And your wife's coddling has all but guaranteed he never moves out. She says it's her culture that he should stay til he's married? Who does she expect to marry him - he's not a fully functioning adult. He doesn't do his laundry. He doesn't pay bills. And even IF (big huge if) he did find a woman who was willing to take that on, I doubt your wife would accept her as good enough for her \"baby\". \n\nYou have a serious decision to make.", "NTA.\n\nHe is old enough to have his own place, he has a job (that I assume can afford atleast a decent 1 bedroom apartment), and he seems very capable.\n\nUnless there is more to this story, put your foot down, draw some boundaries, and make him grow up.", "So tell wife she eithers gets a job to pay for her 'baby' or he gets a job and pays his own way.\n\nHe needs to learn how to take care of a house if he is going to be a good husband.\n\nMost of the young people that age from other cultures who live at home would be mowing the lawn, painting the fence etc. Yard work, fixing things in and around the house AND paying towards the food bill. \n\nNTA- your son is working, he can pay for his own things now and your wife needs to quit treating him like a child.", "\"He just sat at the beach for a year.\" I can't even imagine that life. \n\nNTA.", "Nta. Even in \"old country \" sons are expected to start earning and take care of their parents if they don't move out", "Yes, in many culture children do stay in the house till they are married. Although, and I could be wrong, but they also contribute to the family \n\nNta", "NTA. He needs to grow up and get out. Allowing him to live at home is only making things worse. He NEEDS responsibility, of which he currently has none.\n\nI will admit that I lived with my parents for a while in my 20\u2019s, but I also had moved out several times as well. But when I was living with my parents, I was paying rent and helping around the house, and doing the best I could to stay out of their way and not interrupt their life more than was necessary. \n\nCUT THE CORD.

He knows she will protect her \"baby\" from the big mean dad and the world.", "NTA\n\nI can understand wanting some time to relax after graduating and working hard towards it but your son is taking full advantage of that and your wife is enabling him.", "NTA. Sounds like it\u2019s time to consider drastic measures. Your wife is never going to let him move out. No potential life partner he finds will ever be good enough for her baby. I have a feeling this is going to devolve into a me or him situation and if you take it that far, you need to be prepared that she will pick him and you will need to walk away from both of them.", "NTA - Well, he's never going to get married because who in their right mind would want someone so totally useless?  If your wife is that dead set on continuing to enable and coddle this mobile lump, it might be time for you to consider going south on your own.  You said drastic measures might be on the table--a trial separation might be what it takes.  I don't know if your wife works or not, but when she realizes that she is in danger of losing her husband and having nothing left but a son who can't even take care of himself, let alone her, it might be the wake up call she needs.  And if not, you'll know where you stand and can make your further decisions accordingly.", "NTA. Unless there's not a good reason for him to contribute (ie demonstrating clear saving to buy a place and everyone agrees some concessions) then he should be contributing as a grown man with a job. \n\nWhere I'm from at least it's simply common courtesy to pay rent if you're living with family.", "idk about y\u2019all ladies but i would never marry a man that\u2019s living at home and has mommy calling him her baby and doing his laundry", "Nta. He's working and not like he's newly 18. You've been supporting him as an adult for 7 years. \nAt some point he needs to grow up", "NTA, at the very very minimum he should be saving for his future.  \n     \nIn an ideal world, 3 years ago he would\u2019ve been saving his money from not having to pay rent- more if possible- and be able to buy a house by now. Especially if he wasn\u2019t paying for any necessities really; presumably he would\u2019ve been able to save up over 100k by now", "NTA, fyi, in order for him to be traditionally living at home until he's married, he actually has to go out and meet people to find a future wife. Frankly, a grown man living with his parents when he doesn't have to is going to be a hard enough sell, but a grown man living at home with a \"Lego Room\"! Hell no! Run away ladies, run fast. That just screams \"husband who won't even pick up after himself and as you juggle 2 screaming babies, he'll be complaining about the noise as spends all day on his playstation.\"", "Nta however for the truck costing as much as your house was 25 years ago. Yeah, cause you bought your house *25 years ago*.  That's not really a legit complaint. Trucks are expensive. \n\nThe other stuff, sure.", "Is she expecting to find a willing future DIL to take him off your hands because I assure you they are unlikely to be lining up to take over looking after a mooch... NTA he needs to start adulting.", "NTA\n\nAsk your wife what type of women will want to stay with a man who has mummy still doing his laundry. Most people these day will accept times are tough and adults live with their parents what they won't accept is basically a free loader who isn't contributing to the house they live in. No one wants to look after a grown adult.\n\nDid you leave it abit late trying to get him to grow the hell up yup, but better now then never.  Your wife is doing a great injustice to your son.", "NTA. \n\nI have two in their 20s. They both pay rent and one of the household bills each and for their own cellphones. \n\nOne buys all her own groceries and prepares her own food, pays her own car insurance and gas. The other eats our groceries but shares in the cooking and chores. \n\nBoth do their own laundry. I still carry their insurance, but they make their own appointments, pay their own copays, and for any prescriptions they might need. \n\nDo to a disability, one of them only works part time, but still does the above. \n\nYour wife is enabling your son.", "NTA. My parents never paid for a car or university. I had a job since 13. Did laundry since I was 9. At 18 I was to pay half rent. \n\nWhy would he grow up and be responsible when he doesn't have to?", "Wife has\u2026\u201dissues\u201d.  I wish you luck.  NTA", "INFO - if you\u2019re son marries his Legos or his computer, will your wife make him move out quicker?", "NTA. Honestly, an intervention now will actually be good for him so he doesn\u2019t turn into a 40yo old who can\u2019t live without his mommy and daddy\u2026.", "NTA, a cold chill of fear ran through me, I really hope that my daughter launches way before that. If your wife doesn\u2019t get on board you may need to get family counselling and move along if she refuses.", "NTA\n\nYou know the situation isn't doing your son any favors because he's not prepared to live on his own like an adult. You're probably not going to change your wife's mind, so what are you prepared to do to stop this?", "NTA your kid is a mooch and your wife an enabler. You need to think about YOUR retirement. That's not going to be comfortable at all if you have nothing left after supporting a full grown extra man.", "NTA - family does not mean a free ride, and he has that confused. That said you and your wife have modeled privilege to him and now he is acting entitled and self focused.", "The asshole. Clearly your son.", "NTA - He's never going to get a girlfriend let alone get married the way he is living. You need to sit both of them down and set a time line. He has X number of months to save up. Pay some sort of rent or move out.", "NTA it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask your adult son to help pay for rent. At his age he needs to start learning responsibilities and doing things on his own. It might even motivate him to get his own place. I do understand her thoughts on not wanting to move away from her son. Maybe in a few years after he has his life together. But being young and moving out it is beneficial to have your parents until you start to figure things out. It built my relationship with my parents. My boyfriend moved out his parents moved away and they are not as close as they used to be\u2026 don\u2019t get to see the grand babies or celebrate holidays as easily. That\u2019s just my options", "NTA. The kid has some life lessons to learn, and your wife is doing him a disservice by coddling him. \n\n\nMaybe to get through to her, you need to reframe the situation not as you being \"cheap\" but as making sure your son has the skills needed to be a competent adult. I'm also assuming here that he doesn't have any undiagnosed mental health issues that is stopping him from moving on.", "NTA. \n\nHe's living there rent free and you won't get any kind of government support for the child anymore as he's not a child (or thats how it works in the UK anyway).\n\nIts normal for him not to move out until he gets marries because he literally couldn't afford to, even if he was motivated to do so, which it sounds like he isn't.\n\nI didn't move out of my parents until I was in a relationship and 26. But the way he's living, it makes no sense for him to want to move out and lower is disposable income.\n\nYour wife just has her mothering instincs and doesn't want her baby to leave home. Try a different approach and explain your side of things and she might understand better.", "NTA\n\nAnd your son can thank your wife when he finds himself alone, totally incapable of living on his own when his parents can no longer take care of his needs. He has gotten used to living beyond his means, complete with a maid/mother. And the way he\u2019s living, he\u2019ll probably not be able to restrain his spending to make a relationship or marriage work, so expect him to leech off of you for a long, long time to come.", "NTA set a hard deadline that he needs to get out because the house is going up for sale. Your wife can buy you out if she wants to stay in the home with her spoiled child", "NTA tell them you are retiring and he is to be responsible for all of the bills for the home.", "I would say take off and leave them both, but will you end up paying for the house and alimony?\n\nYou'd still end up supporting them, but maybe not as much as now.", "NTA in this circumstance, but you and your wife (more your wife by the sound of it) have certainly done the world a disservice by raising yet another entitled and incompetent man. Oh goodie, just what we all need more of in our lives\u2026", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s babying is crippling her son. You might want to ask her what will happen to her baby if/when something happens to her. She is depriving him of becoming an adult.", "NTA, sorry you even feel the need to ask.", "Take drastic measure because she is not.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \nMy brother is like this. \nHe is 43. \nDO SOMETHING NOW", "NTA she is doing him a big disservice as he's not a functional adult.  Paying rent is the least he can do.", "Split finances and bills. She wants to pay for him cool.", "Sure, its one thing if he lives there until he marries. Doesn't mean his parents should are supposed to be pamper him, he should definitely be sharing bills with you at the very least. He shouldnhe ashamed, he is spending his money fo4 his hobbies, but isn't helping or contributing in any way possible. In my culture, when kids grow up, its their turn to help out parents, if possible, and especially when they are living at home. Your wife is probably th3 one who made him this wayy sh3 enables him, and who knows how long its been going on", "ESH? First of all 25 years ago houses sold for dirt cheap and today cars are not cheap so I do think you have some boomer ideas about the economy, that said, he's 25 and I do think capable of working out a plan to leave the nest or contribute, at a minimum to his own food and share of the utilities.
