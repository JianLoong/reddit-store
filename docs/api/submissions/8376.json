You have an adult son who behaves like a 16 year old, and an adult wife who enables this.     I'm not sure what you mean by drastic, but you have every right to have him move out, or move out yourself if you and your wife are not on the same page.    \n\nI do suggest having a firm but civil conversation with your wife, explaining that you won't be around forever, and he had better learn sooner rather than later how to take care of himself.

Frankly, a grown man living with his parents when he doesn't have to is going to be a hard enough sell, but a grown man living at home with a \"Lego Room\"! Hell no! Run away ladies, run fast.

Clearly your son.", "NTA - He's never going to get a girlfriend let alone get married the way he is living. You need to sit both of them down and set a time line. He has X number of months to save up. Pay some sort of rent or move out.", "NTA it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask your adult son to help pay for rent. At his age he needs to start learning responsibilities and doing things on his own. It might even motivate him to get his own place. I do understand her thoughts on not wanting to move away from her son. Maybe in a few years after he has his life together. But being young and moving out it is beneficial to have your parents until you start to figure things out. It built my relationship with my parents.

That\u2019s just my options", "NTA. The kid has some life lessons to learn, and your wife is doing him a disservice by coddling him. \n\n\nMaybe to get through to her, you need to reframe the situation not as you being \"cheap\" but as making sure your son has the skills needed to be a competent adult.

But the way he's living, it makes no sense for him to want to move out and lower is disposable income.\n\nYour wife just has her mothering instincs and doesn't want her baby to leave home. Try a different approach and explain your side of things and she might understand better.", "NTA\n\nAnd your son can thank your wife when he finds himself alone, totally incapable of living on his own when his parents can no longer take care of his needs. He has gotten used to living beyond his means, complete with a maid/mother. And the way he\u2019s living, he\u2019ll probably not be able to restrain his spending to make a relationship or marriage work, so expect him to leech off of you for a long, long time to come.", "NTA set a hard deadline that he needs to get out because the house is going up for sale. Your wife can buy you out if she wants to stay in the home with her spoiled child", "NTA tell them you are retiring and he is to be responsible for all of the bills for the home.", "I would say take off and leave them both, but will you end up paying for the house and alimony?\n\nYou'd still end up supporting them, but maybe not as much as now.", "NTA in this circumstance, but you and your wife (more your wife by the sound of it) have certainly done the world a disservice by raising yet another entitled and incompetent man.
