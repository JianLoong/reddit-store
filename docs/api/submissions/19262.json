They paid split rent and me and my siblings stayed part time while my cousins stayed full time. My mom and my aunt got into a fight over my aunt's boyfriend who has had multiple DUIs and it led to my mom moving out. My sister got dirty emails from my aunt, I, a ten year old, got screamed at by my aunt during an uncomfortable car drive as well as watched her bait my mom into an argument in front of me (my mom tried to ignore her because I was there but she got in her face), and worst of all, when my brother came to pick up his stuff, my aunt called the police on him for breaking in and he spent the night in jail. He never stole anything, he was just picking up his stuff before my mom was fully moved out, and my aunt was fully aware of this. As a kid, I was horrified, I genuinely thought my brother was going to be stuck in jail and falsely accused, and the anger and helplessness I felt towards my aunt when I was just a kid... It is a moment I will never forget. There is a lot more to the story but I don't want to go over the word limit. \n\nMy family decided to play neutral and me and my siblings never got an apology. Nobody in my family stuck up for us. Not even a private message. Soon we stopped getting invited to the family parties because \"my aunt would be there and they didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable.\" When my mother had her wedding, only her sister came, and the rest of the family admitted they didn't want to go and hurt my aunt's feelings.  After that I removed everyone from Facebook and decided I didn't need them in my or my future family's life.\n\nWell I guess one of my cousin's (not my aunt's child) noticed we were no longer friends on Facebook when inviting everyone to her baby shower. She reached out and said something along the lines of \"now that you're an adult you can come back to family gatherings without your mom\" but a little less blunt, as well as asking why I removed her in an offended kind of way. I told her that I unadded her for a reason and I did not want to talk to her, she and the rest of the family were never there for me as a kid, and I want nothing to do with them or any kids they have in the future. She tried to argue a little and say \"there's two sides to every story you know\" and I snapped and told her \"I was there to witness everything, I'm not going to spend money on a family who was never there for me, I don't care about your baby shower and I definitely don't care about your baby.\" Obviously the entire family is pissed at me for stirring up 10 year old drama and I got texts from them all saying I should get over it by now.\n\nI think I may have been the asshole because it's not just my one cousin, it was the entire family, and I probably shouldn't have said all that to a hormonal and pregnant lady. I just got so upset at the idea of being expected to care about their baby when they never cared about me, my siblings, and what we went through.", "created_utc": 1686184641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143u8cm/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_i_dont_care_about_her/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

BLOCK ALL OF THOSE TOXIC PEOPLE. connecting with those people only cause u more DRAMA in the future. protect your family and cherish every moment with them without those TOXIC PEOPLE", "NTA you have your reasons. The only thing you messed up on, is just removing them. You are supposed to block them altogether.", "NTA. It\u2019s a little ridiculous for the family to say that you brought up the 10 year old drama when they can\u2019t seem to invite your mom back to family functions still.", "NTA. She's only interested in your wallet.  If she really cared she'd have noticed you removed her before she was making a guest list.", "NTA.\n\nThey weren\u2019t neutral. They chose your aunt and they chose to believe your aunt\u2019s side of the story.\n\nYou\u2019re also, by their example, playing \u201cneutral\u201d it\u2019s just that your on the other side of the neutral coin to them.", "NTA- They showed their colors to you when you're at your most vulnerable.

I would never forgive anyone putting my brother in jail in BS charges, not would I forgive those who ignored how awful that was. That's just one incident. I probably would never speak to that family again. Let them find someone else to abuse. Stay strong. Good luck in life. You deserve only the best.", "NTA, she probably just wants gifts for her shower.", "NTA, tell the bi\\*ch of a cousin that you have been and adult for two years and the only time she gets in contact with you is when she wants a fu\\*king gift.
