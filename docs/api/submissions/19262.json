Having to listen to excuses and attempts to minimise what happened, all while the sound of my sibling crying was still clear in my mind, led to me saying some pretty blunt things (I still don\u2019t regret it though). \n\nSo I stopped engaging. I haven\u2019t spoken to any of them for over a decade and I got to tell you, it was a relief. Like a weight was off my shoulders. All that energy went to my friends and my (immediate) family.

And you're right, your cousin **isn't** your entire family, but everything she said to you was indicative of the entire family. She caught the entirety of your rage because she made the hideously pregnancy brained choice to suggest that it was some kind of act of charity to invite you now that you're older, and to act offended that her ass wasn't on your friends list when she didn't pay attention to you for **10 years.**\n\nAnd yeah, it might be harsh to brush her actions off in the fashion written, but that's honestly the charitable approach. That's me assuming your cousin isn't generally this incompetently insensitive and selfish, and that it's only when she's up the duff that she's like that. It's very possible that in ten years she's just developed to be that lacking in consideration. Either way, why should you give a jolly rats ass about her baby when she didn't give a shit about you or your family in ten years?\n\nAs for the rest of your family.
