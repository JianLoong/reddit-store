Maybe there is some financial fanagiling (second mortgage, etc.) so that the brother can stay in the house. If they are doing so well, maybe they just want to give your husband the equivalent of your husband's share. Maybe they want to buy the house between the two of them, and take care of all of the taxes and expenses while letting the brother live there for free. Frankly, if he's not saved any money, he's not going to be able to afford to live there, will end up selling the house, and he alone will be getting the profit. He's an adult. He's known all his life that the FIL will pass away - and he either does or diesn't have his own plan - the brothers shouldn't be treating him like a 55 yo baby.\n\nBut, the father has said he wants his estate shared equally and that is what should be done.

Ideally Dan would buy out your daughters 25% of the house. Clearly he is not the type of person who will step up and do that. I think the decision is 100% your husbands though. You are not in the will and its not your dad. You really dont get a vote in this situation. I get its very frustrating but you are the a-hole here. Imagine your little brothers wife tried to dictate what should happen to your parents estate. Would you stand for that?", "Perhaps the wealthier siblings can buy out OP's husband's share, if he's not in a position to make a multi-hundreds of thousands of dollar's gift to Dan.", "NTA you have already bailed them out of their debts, however, depending on how much the house is worth 1/4 may not be worth it.", "I commented on another post about our contributions and can comment more if it helpful.  Years ago we asked FIL to change will and just have the portion for hubs to go to daughter.

This way should any beneficiaries decide to donate their portion to Dan and his wife so they can purchase a house that seems most reasonable and removes any pressure or obligation for others to do the same or to have to buy out anyone that doesn\u2019t want to do the same.

Assuming that the property is not in a Transfer on Death Deed state if it had been set up beforehand by FIL where it can be transferred without probate, then all four parties would need to agree that BIL and wife/family would have to agree they buy out the other three for their share equally.  Otherwise it would need to be sold, and based upon how much FIL paid for it and it gets sold for, the Fab F4 would need to potentially pay huge capital gains tax on the proceeds and the probate attorney isn't going to do it without money up front without issue by the executor.", "After reading OP's comments which definitely clarify that Dan didn't seem to be doing much caregiver, just freeloading off of FIL, overall id say NTA. However, 1) it's your husband's inheritance not your daughter's, he gets the final say. Is the house paid off, because if it isn't it sounds like you'll be on the hook for mortgage payments and it doesn't sound like Dan will be reliable to pay 75% of that or property taxes and the like. Giving him the house and writing it off as a loss in order to cut ties might be cheaper in the long run depending on how much that 25% stake is worth. \n\nIf it is paid off already and Dan will be able to pay his share of taxes and such then you should consider 2) what will 25% ownership give your husband/daughter? Doesn't sound like Dan will be able to buy her out, so unless if his plan is to sell the house and you would get your cut, then it seems like you'd just own 25% of a house that Dan is going to continue living in and your asset will be tied up forever.", "YTA... it's not your daughters portion. You made that up to manipulate the story.  The inheritance is your husbands portion. This is his decision to make. If he feels tha Dan has earned it by caregiving- then the decision is your husbands to make. I'm sure he has heard your opinion enough already.", "YTA not your family, not your fight.

Dan will own 3/4ths of the property, the controlling interest. He'll still get to stay and ultimately decide what happens to the property. Your best bet would be to get him to buy you out of your 1/4 ownership.", "If you live in America: YTA\n\nI mean\u2026 Dan and his wife are the primary caregivers of your FIL, they don\u2019t pay rent but the money they would be giving would otherwise be going straight to a caregiver. Just because Dan likes to take the occasional vacation without his Father (who sounds like because of his age and health concerns, a deep sea fishing trip wouldn\u2019t even be feasible for him). So even if you take care of FIL every weekend for an entire year while Dan and your SIL take care of him during the week, you take care of him just 102 days compared to their 260 (give or take).\n\nI don\u2019t think you realize how expensive nursing homes or personal health aides are (in America at least). Often times, if the elderly person is the owner of their home when they go into a nursing home, the nursing home takes ownership of that home as collateral, because they\u2019re fucking expensive. For a shared room your looking at over 7k a month, for a private, your looking at 9-10k (again that\u2019s just the average in America). For a home health aide for that level of care, you\u2019re looking at about 5k per month (60k annually).\n\nIf you are so concerned about your daughter\u2019s financial future immediately put the money that goes to your husband into a fund for her. Cause frankly without your BIL and SIL, there wouldn\u2019t be any money to inherit anyways.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live in America: NAH, caregiver burnout is real and they truly are the unsung heroes of families. I don\u2019t know if you have ever dealt with a sundowning person, but it\u2019s not for the weak. They will attack you with some inhuman strength, they might not even know who you are, they might not even know who they are.

A lot of times they will go through multiple health aides before finding the right fit (my own grandmother went through 5 different ones through the state before we realized we would have to hire through a private company) and even with nursing homes or assisted living facilities the kids have to stay on top of the nurses and staff because elder abuse is unfortunately rampant in these industries.\n\nThat being said, Dan and SIL are also dicks for using his dad\u2019s credit cards without permission- however it is possible that he did give permission and then forgot. (In this case - especially with the wedding, is unlikely) The amount of times my grandmother has blamed my mom or one of my aunts on losing her EBT card saying that they were the last ones to have it, and then one of us proceeding to find it somewhere in her room is honestly laughable.

I hope the fil is ok, as people are squabbling over the inheritance before he\u2019s even passed, won\u2019t be a nice feeling for him. \n\nPersonally, I think the fairest thing is do what the fil has decreed in the will, don\u2019t cause him any more stress when you should be focused on spending time with him whilst he is still here.\n\nOnce things have been divided up, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s else business whatever each sub,ing plans to do with their share. Keep it, gift it\u2026 give it away, just stop squabbling over it for goodness sake.", "Info: What are your husbands thoughts about this prior to you giving your opinion?", "This is confusingly written. You seem to have three brother in laws, but sometimes refer to one of them (Dan?) as \"BIL\". Also, learn the difference between to, too and two. \n\nESH. You are assuming a lot, example that your husband's share goes to your daughter (unless part of the confusingly written bit is that your daughter has a part of the inherence that you've left out, but then it wouldn't be 1/4). You should let your husband handle his family affairs and stay TF out of it. But also Dan sounds like a user so he is also an asshole - HOWEVER you aren't making it clear how much daily caretaking he is doing for FIL.

He committed fraud by using his fathers credit card and the other siblings had to pay it off. He didn\u2019t want a caregiver coming into the house because?!?! Conditions his father was living in? I think OP is right. The house, as per FIL\u2019s wishes, should be divided between the sons. Dan can get a mortgage and give  them their share and continue to live there or sell the house, share the money and use his share to set himself up. We don\u2019t know the conditions his father was living under because Dan is away a lot in leisure pursuits. I feel that if the house was given to Dan the other brothers will be paying all the bills in the future because Dan won\u2019t be. He knows the others will bail him out as they did over the credit card debt. Does his wife work? OP is definitely NTA.", "YTA he is not even dead and you already have the greedy $ eyes", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re super critical of Dan and maybe some of the fraud and elder abuse you\u2019re insinuating is true or maybe you\u2019re trying to find causes to justify vilifying your BIL. I don\u2019t know. But I believe you will find most people unsympathetic to you claiming 1/4 of house assets in favor of your daughter and I think you need to consider being less involved for a few reasons. \n\nFirstly, if you don\u2019t have need of the house assets, and clearly you don\u2019t if you\u2019re looking out for your offspring. Is there an executor noted for when your FIL dies? Are you looking to have 1/4 of house assets willed to your daughter or are you going to transfer and if the latter, why? If you and your husband do not need the money, you might be better off not entangling your daughter in inheritance assets of this nature for the sake of future fafsa and such. \n\nSecondly, I think you\u2019re totally overlooking how hard it is to be a caregiver and how much of oneself it takes to be on call like that. If BIL didn\u2019t expand his business, maybe it\u2019s because he was keeping FIL alive and happy in his home? \n\nLastly, consider the money your BIL saved by keeping your FIL out of a long term facility. In a lot of situations he probably would have had to sell his house, which would have not been ideal for him, I\u2019m sure! If BIL doesn\u2019t even have insurance and you can afford it, perhaps you can follow lead of other siblings. \n\nSo in conclusion, before you go grabbing for assets that aren\u2019t yet yours, let your husband know your concerns, discuss if you\u2019d also like to donate your combined 1/4 share, and maybe have him deal with his siblings directly so your bias doesn\u2019t create conflict during assumedly what is end of life care.", "It's not hers...or yours...", "YTA.

FIL ain't dead yet, you said he's mentally sound, and you're literally arguing over his corpse before it's a corpse! It's still FIL's decision who he leaves what.  I guess it's productive to have discussions like this among family ahead of time to clarify FIL's wishes and comment, but it seems very presumptive to argue over the proceeds of a will before someone is even in the ground.

You\u2019re not giving your daughter\u2019s inheritance to anyone. Your husband is choosing to give HIS inheritance to his brother. That is his choice and really you have no right to an opinion. Tell your husband to do well and your daughter will have that inheritance when he dies.", "Info: You say FIL would not have been able to stay in the house without Dan. In most case, this means either the parent is unable to pay the rent/mortgage on their own & the child is paying a portion or/and the child is a caregiver.
