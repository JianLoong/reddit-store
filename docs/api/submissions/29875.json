One of her two sons lives with them.\n\nFIL has said that when he passes he would like for his house to be divided equally among his four children including my hub.  Father-in-law would not be able to remain in his house if Dan and his spouse were not in the house with him.  Dan is self employed and has never had health insurance except for when he married his wife. He makes money ,managing a window cleaning business.

He also can not control his bowels and needs to be changed washed.  We now have full-time help but it was a struggle as Dan and his wife and son did not want anyone coming into the house. It is also a struggle because FIL does not want anyone helping him but now understands that he needs assistance.\n\nSib 1 and Sib 2 have never been involved with their father since graduating college.  The two grandchildren have only seen their grandfather probably a total of seven times for a day.  Sib 1 has done very well, Sib 2 exceptionally well.\n\nDan and his wife have not been financially responsible and used their dad\u2018s credit card to pay for their wedding and honeymoon.

Dan and his wife have really not saved any money.  \n\nI told my husband I would be very upset if he did not have the 1/4 of the estate given to our daughter. Just because Dan and his wife have not saved money, I do not think our daughters should give her portion of the estate.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my husband that he should say he does not agree with giving up our daughter\u2019s portion of the estate.  It is fine if his two siblings want to do so but they should not be telling us what we should be doing.  \n\nYes it\u2019s a lot of work for BIL.\n\nEdit1: Hubs asked Dad to change will to Daughter so she is entitled. My hubs is the youngest and is the executor. Dad had an accident 4 years ago which is when everything changed.  Up until that point he could get around.  He wants to be in his house which we support.   I do not think his sibs have the right to ask her father to give up her portion. She loves her grandfather and has a close relationship.

Maybe there is some financial fanagiling (second mortgage, etc.) so that the brother can stay in the house. If they are doing so well, maybe they just want to give your husband the equivalent of your husband's share. Maybe they want to buy the house between the two of them, and take care of all of the taxes and expenses while letting the brother live there for free. Frankly, if he's not saved any money, he's not going to be able to afford to live there, will end up selling the house, and he alone will be getting the profit. He's an adult. He's known all his life that the FIL will pass away - and he either does or diesn't have his own plan - the brothers shouldn't be treating him like a 55 yo baby.\n\nBut, the father has said he wants his estate shared equally and that is what should be done. It's not up to anyone else to change the terms of dad's will or try to force others to bend to their will.\n\nI've never seen it end well when the will is not followed.", "NTA, Let me explain why: You have repeatedly bailed Dan and his wife out. So, the final bailout is your husband gives away his inheritance?\n\nIf you'd never rescued Dan and Wife , then I could see your hubby playing Mr. Nice Guy.

Ideally Dan would buy out your daughters 25% of the house. Clearly he is not the type of person who will step up and do that. I think the decision is 100% your husbands though. You are not in the will and its not your dad. You really dont get a vote in this situation. I get its very frustrating but you are the a-hole here. Imagine your little brothers wife tried to dictate what should happen to your parents estate. Would you stand for that?", "Perhaps the wealthier siblings can buy out OP's husband's share, if he's not in a position to make a multi-hundreds of thousands of dollar's gift to Dan.", "NTA you have already bailed them out of their debts, however, depending on how much the house is worth 1/4 may not be worth it.", "I commented on another post about our contributions and can comment more if it helpful.  Years ago we asked FIL to change will and just have the portion for hubs to go to daughter.

You say FIL is mentally there so did he gift them money or are you implying they stole it?", "Not clear on how your husband\u2019s portion became your daughter\u2019s ??? \n\nAnyway - it seems to me the house should be sold and divided as intended. This way should any beneficiaries decide to donate their portion to Dan and his wife so they can purchase a house that seems most reasonable and removes any pressure or obligation for others to do the same or to have to buy out anyone that doesn\u2019t want to do the same.

Assuming that the property is not in a Transfer on Death Deed state if it had been set up beforehand by FIL where it can be transferred without probate, then all four parties would need to agree that BIL and wife/family would have to agree they buy out the other three for their share equally.  Otherwise it would need to be sold, and based upon how much FIL paid for it and it gets sold for, the Fab F4 would need to potentially pay huge capital gains tax on the proceeds and the probate attorney isn't going to do it without money up front without issue by the executor.", "After reading OP's comments which definitely clarify that Dan didn't seem to be doing much caregiver, just freeloading off of FIL, overall id say NTA. However, 1) it's your husband's inheritance not your daughter's, he gets the final say. Is the house paid off, because if it isn't it sounds like you'll be on the hook for mortgage payments and it doesn't sound like Dan will be reliable to pay 75% of that or property taxes and the like. Giving him the house and writing it off as a loss in order to cut ties might be cheaper in the long run depending on how much that 25% stake is worth. \n\nIf it is paid off already and Dan will be able to pay his share of taxes and such then you should consider 2) what will 25% ownership give your husband/daughter? Doesn't sound like Dan will be able to buy her out, so unless if his plan is to sell the house and you would get your cut, then it seems like you'd just own 25% of a house that Dan is going to continue living in and your asset will be tied up forever.", "YTA... it's not your daughters portion. You made that up to manipulate the story.  The inheritance is your husbands portion. This is his decision to make. If he feels tha Dan has earned it by caregiving- then the decision is your husbands to make. I'm sure he has heard your opinion enough already.", "YTA not your family, not your fight.

Dan will own 3/4ths of the property, the controlling interest. He'll still get to stay and ultimately decide what happens to the property. Your best bet would be to get him to buy you out of your 1/4 ownership.", "If you live in America: YTA\n\nI mean\u2026 Dan and his wife are the primary caregivers of your FIL, they don\u2019t pay rent but the money they would be giving would otherwise be going straight to a caregiver. Just because Dan likes to take the occasional vacation without his Father (who sounds like because of his age and health concerns, a deep sea fishing trip wouldn\u2019t even be feasible for him). So even if you take care of FIL every weekend for an entire year while Dan and your SIL take care of him during the week, you take care of him just 102 days compared to their 260 (give or take).\n\nI don\u2019t think you realize how expensive nursing homes or personal health aides are (in America at least). Often times, if the elderly person is the owner of their home when they go into a nursing home, the nursing home takes ownership of that home as collateral, because they\u2019re fucking expensive. For a shared room your looking at over 7k a month, for a private, your looking at 9-10k (again that\u2019s just the average in America). For a home health aide for that level of care, you\u2019re looking at about 5k per month (60k annually).\n\nIf you are so concerned about your daughter\u2019s financial future immediately put the money that goes to your husband into a fund for her. Cause frankly without your BIL and SIL, there wouldn\u2019t be any money to inherit anyways.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live in America: NAH, caregiver burnout is real and they truly are the unsung heroes of families. I don\u2019t know if you have ever dealt with a sundowning person, but it\u2019s not for the weak. They will attack you with some inhuman strength, they might not even know who you are, they might not even know who they are. They will cuss, spit, degrade, and you can\u2019t blame them cause they don\u2019t really have any control of themselves and they sure as shit ain\u2019t gonna apologize come morning cause they ain\u2019t gonna remember ever doing that.", "YTA.\n\nThis is none of your business. \n\nYour husband's portion of the estate is his. \n\nTypically,  an inheritance is not considered martial property.\n\nNot yours,  not your daughter's. \n\nYou come across as greedy and manipulative.", "YTA because your daughter is not an heir.

A lot of times they will go through multiple health aides before finding the right fit (my own grandmother went through 5 different ones through the state before we realized we would have to hire through a private company) and even with nursing homes or assisted living facilities the kids have to stay on top of the nurses and staff because elder abuse is unfortunately rampant in these industries.\n\nThat being said, Dan and SIL are also dicks for using his dad\u2019s credit cards without permission- however it is possible that he did give permission and then forgot.

The Will should stipulate that the house be sold and the proceeds divided among the heirs.  If one or more heirs wish to keep the house then those heirs can purchase it from the estate.\n\nBTW here is why you don't leave one house to multiple non-married heirs: one will want to live in it, one will want to rent it for income, one will want to sell it, and another will be on the verge of bankruptcy which puts any equity in it at risk of being taken to pay off that heir's creditors.\n\nHeirs don't collect anything until the creditors have been paid.  This discussion may be moot depending upon the value of the rest of FIL's estate.  If he doesn't have enough other assets to cover his medical and other final expenses and/or he's on Medicaid, then the house would have to be sold by the estate to pay those expenses.  Getting old, getting sick, and dying aren't cheap these days.

I get where you\u2019re coming from but your reason isn\u2019t valid. I know that in your mind you are just looking out for your daughters, but this literally has nothing to do with your daughters. Life is shitty sometimes and gkd forbid but your daughters could both die tragically tomorrow. People get run over by buses. Your husband could divorce your and disown your daughters and run off to Tahiti with a model. He could sell his portion of the estate to the other siblings, and then blow all that money on gambling. Or he could just use it to pay for the family\u2018s day-to-day living expenses. \n\nOne of the things that was drilled into our heads in property class in law school is that there is no such thing as an inheritance prior to someone actually dying. In other words, even your husband does not have an inheritance right now. His father is still alive. On a technicality, his father could sell that house tomorrow. So there is no inheritance here for your daughters because there\u2019s no inheritance here for your husband yet either. \n\nI don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s a good idea to leave Dan the house either simply because he sounds like the type who won\u2019t keep up with the property taxes and it will end up getting repo\u2019d. But you don\u2019t actually have a dog in this hunt, especially because in most places an inheritance is not considered part of marital property. It\u2019s fine to state your opinion once, but getting angry about it or insisting that your husband follow your chosen preference isn\u2019t a position that you have any moral obligation to take right now. The siblings get to make the decision on what to do with **their** inheritance, and you get to go along with it. \n\nNow, if your husband is discussing this with you, and basically agrees with you, but doesn\u2019t feel like going up against the other two siblings, I suggest that the other two siblings buy out your husband\u2019s share. If they want to be generous, that\u2019s fine, but they should buy out his share. Alternately, a life estate plan would be good as well, where Dan is allowed to live in the house for the rest of his natural life, but he does not actually own it. These kind of arrangements are extremely common in situations such as this, and in ones, where say somebody remarried, and wants to leave the estate to the children of the first marriage, but also doesn\u2019t want their spouse to be homeless when they die. The estate of the deceased owns the house until the person who lives there either leaves or dies, and then it gets split among the next in line in the succession.

And casually keep up to date on when the will reading and probate execution court date will happen, and then be there.\n\nNTA.", "Jfc y\u2019all arguing about dividing up a man\u2019s wealth before he even dies. Y\u2019all all trash. Tf she gonna do with a 1/4 of a house?", "YTA why would your husband ask to have it changed to your daughter? And did that happen?", "Yta. It is none of your business where his money goes. I think 3 of the 4 brothers would want Dan to have the house. 4 if your husband didn't have to listen to your opinion about it. Your daughter should inherit from you and you and you hubs, not from the father in law.", "> We now have full-time help but it was a struggle as Dan and his wife and son did not want anyone coming into the house. \n\nSo Dan's portion should be given to the paid caregivers his father needed but he didn't want to let into the house? I guess that's a reasonable response to credit card fraud.", "Why does she think it's up to her? It's not her money and she's not an hier. Geesh.", "Dan and wife already received more than everyone else.  Paid wedding/ credit cards with they're making no reimbursement.  And the 2 well to do siblings who never participated--keep your opinions to yourselves!", "My aunt is currently living with my other aunt until we can get her into hospice. She has a caretaker that's paid, they come in twice a day, once first thing in the morning for like 20 min to wash her up and get her dressed, and once at night (if theyre lucky) to tuck her into bed. Outside of that, every time she needs the bathroom, every time she needs to move from a chair to a bed, every time she has an accident,  needs anyrhing, its my aunt. And if my sick aunt has an early appointment, it's my healthy aunt that gets her up and washed and dressed because usually it's before the time the caregiver is scheduled to show up. Having in home help, for most people, gives like an hour reprieve. Even if you can afford 24/7 service, the odds of actually finding someone with the current Healthcare situation is basicslly zero.", "If anything all of those things he sucked out of his parents should be taken out of their share, but that\u2019s not reality. In no way should they just be handed everything. That\u2019s rewarding bad behavior.", "But it's not how FIL wants to divide it, either. He wants to divide it into four parts- three out of four of his children are trying to strongarm it into all going to one child.", "This is the advice. You definitely sound like you've been around the block with this stuff before.", "Read a little more closely-- OP's husband asked Himself for his portion of the inheritance to go straight to his daughter instead, before this.", "So \u2026. DAN STOLE MONEY FROM HIS DAD FOR GIS WEDDING AND HONEYMOON?!?!?! How is this not in the post!!!", "By thr sounds of it the fil didn't want it either until he was forced into it. I'd guess Dan and his wife were taking care of dad at least fairly adequately. I'm sure if he was filthy and full of bedsores she would have mentioned it", "Fortunately I was not personally involved, I just watched the train wreck from a safe distance.", "If OP's husband is the executor, he can take his 1/4 share. If the other two don't take their shares, the executor can have it go to Deadbeat Dan (if no one contests it, noones will be looking in go it). Or the other two brothers can take their share and then gift it to Deadbeat Dan, either $16K to Dan and $16K to his wife tax free each year, or all at once and just count it as part of their personal estate.", "It appeared to me that she wanted her husband's family to get 1/4 of the FIL's estate that the FIL would will to them. She is related to the FIL through her marriage to her husband. She says \"our daughter\" which would mean the daughter and FIL are related. If her husband doesn't claim his 1/4 then his daughter gets no benefit from her grandfathers estate, and it is logical to assume the FIL would think his grandchildren were in essense included in his will since they would inherit from their fathers. She wants her daughter written into the will to get the money instead of her husband, since it appears her husband can be swayed - meaning the daughter is disinherited. And why should deadbeat Dan get 100% and loving granddaughter get nothing? It's not what FIL wants.\n\nIf her husband can't stand strong, I can see why she is concerned for her daughter's sake.", "Which still doesn\u2019t make it OP\u2019s.", "No, but especially if the daughter is a minor, it does make OP part of the decision making process on her behalf.  \n\nAnd OP never acted like it was hers to begin with.", "I\u2019d like to know how old the daughter is and whether she has an opinion on the situation.", "Perhaps they are upset about the $10k because Dan and his wife used the father's credit card to pay for things, and then went long enough without paying back that it went to collections.", "Honestly, does it really matter?  OP is worried their kid is getting screwed out of a guaranteed inheritance because their brother in law is shit with his money and stole from the grandfather.  Sounds perfectly reasonable", "If we take her version as gospel maybe, but she also says the BIL and SIL are the reason her FIL could keep living at home. So which is he? Useless or a critical element of elder care? Their home health care worker almost certainly isn\u2019t there to change and clean the FIL in the middle of the night. That\u2019s the BIL and SIL. Something about her depiction of them and what they contribute just doesn\u2019t add up which for me puts the whole thing into some question.", "Feel free to wait until Dan chimes in", "So one good deed justifies fucking over the grandkids in favor of someone who stole from the family.", "Nah, not one good deed. But years of wiping his dad\u2019s ass counts for something. At least enough to not just dismiss him as a deadbeat. I don\u2019t think the daughter should give up her quarter btw. It\u2019s possible to both be right and maybe an AH. Something about her presentation just doesn\u2019t add up for me. YMMV of course. Who knows? Maybe he\u2019s a freeloader who pushed the housework and nighttime adult diaper changes off in his wife."]}
