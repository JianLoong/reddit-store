Maybe there is some financial fanagiling (second mortgage, etc.) so that the brother can stay in the house. If they are doing so well, maybe they just want to give your husband the equivalent of your husband's share. Maybe they want to buy the house between the two of them, and take care of all of the taxes and expenses while letting the brother live there for free. Frankly, if he's not saved any money, he's not going to be able to afford to live there, will end up selling the house, and he alone will be getting the profit. He's an adult. He's known all his life that the FIL will pass away - and he either does or diesn't have his own plan - the brothers shouldn't be treating him like a 55 yo baby.\n\nBut, the father has said he wants his estate shared equally and that is what should be done.

So, the final bailout is your husband gives away his inheritance?\n\nIf you'd never rescued Dan and Wife , then I could see your hubby playing Mr. Nice Guy. But, supporting his brother is not his duty ad infinitum.\n\nIts not wrong to expect him to provide for his child as much as he provides for his brother.", "This is a very common occurrence that causes problems in tons of families. Ideally Dan would buy out your daughters 25% of the house. Clearly he is not the type of person who will step up and do that. I think the decision is 100% your husbands though. You are not in the will and its not your dad. You really dont get a vote in this situation. I get its very frustrating but you are the a-hole here. Imagine your little brothers wife tried to dictate what should happen to your parents estate. Would you stand for that?", "Perhaps the wealthier siblings can buy out OP's husband's share, if he's not in a position to make a multi-hundreds of thousands of dollar's gift to Dan.", "NTA you have already bailed them out of their debts, however, depending on how much the house is worth 1/4 may not be worth it.", "I commented on another post about our contributions and can comment more if it helpful.  Years ago we asked FIL to change will and just have the portion for hubs to go to daughter. And yes, even though he is mentally there, Dan did not ask to use cc to pay wedding etc.  however, my hubs made him share it with FIL.

This way should any beneficiaries decide to donate their portion to Dan and his wife so they can purchase a house that seems most reasonable and removes any pressure or obligation for others to do the same or to have to buy out anyone that doesn\u2019t want to do the same.

Assuming that the property is not in a Transfer on Death Deed state if it had been set up beforehand by FIL where it can be transferred without probate, then all four parties would need to agree that BIL and wife/family would have to agree they buy out the other three for their share equally.  Otherwise it would need to be sold, and based upon how much FIL paid for it and it gets sold for, the Fab F4 would need to potentially pay huge capital gains tax on the proceeds and the probate attorney isn't going to do it without money up front without issue by the executor.", "After reading OP's comments which definitely clarify that Dan didn't seem to be doing much caregiver, just freeloading off of FIL, overall id say NTA. However, 1) it's your husband's inheritance not your daughter's, he gets the final say. Is the house paid off, because if it isn't it sounds like you'll be on the hook for mortgage payments and it doesn't sound like Dan will be reliable to pay 75% of that or property taxes and the like. Giving him the house and writing it off as a loss in order to cut ties might be cheaper in the long run depending on how much that 25% stake is worth. \n\nIf it is paid off already and Dan will be able to pay his share of taxes and such then you should consider 2) what will 25% ownership give your husband/daughter? Doesn't sound like Dan will be able to buy her out, so unless if his plan is to sell the house and you would get your cut, then it seems like you'd just own 25% of a house that Dan is going to continue living in and your asset will be tied up forever.", "YTA... it's not your daughters portion. You made that up to manipulate the story.  The inheritance is your husbands portion. This is his decision to make. If he feels tha Dan has earned it by caregiving- then the decision is your husbands to make. I'm sure he has heard your opinion enough already.", "YTA not your family, not your fight. If your husband doesn\u2019t like it he needs to voice that, but he\u2019s not your mouthpiece.", "Your daughter has no inheritance if I understand your post, it\u2019s only for siblings, so idk", "It's irrelevant. Dan will own 3/4ths of the property, the controlling interest. He'll still get to stay and ultimately decide what happens to the property. Your best bet would be to get him to buy you out of your 1/4 ownership.", "If you live in America: YTA\n\nI mean\u2026 Dan and his wife are the primary caregivers of your FIL, they don\u2019t pay rent but the money they would be giving would otherwise be going straight to a caregiver. Just because Dan likes to take the occasional vacation without his Father (who sounds like because of his age and health concerns, a deep sea fishing trip wouldn\u2019t even be feasible for him). So even if you take care of FIL every weekend for an entire year while Dan and your SIL take care of him during the week, you take care of him just 102 days compared to their 260 (give or take).\n\nI don\u2019t think you realize how expensive nursing homes or personal health aides are (in America at least). Often times, if the elderly person is the owner of their home when they go into a nursing home, the nursing home takes ownership of that home as collateral, because they\u2019re fucking expensive. For a shared room your looking at over 7k a month, for a private, your looking at 9-10k (again that\u2019s just the average in America). For a home health aide for that level of care, you\u2019re looking at about 5k per month (60k annually).\n\nIf you are so concerned about your daughter\u2019s financial future immediately put the money that goes to your husband into a fund for her. Cause frankly without your BIL and SIL, there wouldn\u2019t be any money to inherit anyways.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live in America: NAH, caregiver burnout is real and they truly are the unsung heroes of families. I don\u2019t know if you have ever dealt with a sundowning person, but it\u2019s not for the weak. They will attack you with some inhuman strength, they might not even know who you are, they might not even know who they are.

From what I\u2019ve experienced in my work and dealing with my own grandparents are that old people are very stubborn and their children tend to be very protective of them. A lot of times they will go through multiple health aides before finding the right fit (my own grandmother went through 5 different ones through the state before we realized we would have to hire through a private company) and even with nursing homes or assisted living facilities the kids have to stay on top of the nurses and staff because elder abuse is unfortunately rampant in these industries.\n\nThat being said, Dan and SIL are also dicks for using his dad\u2019s credit cards without permission- however it is possible that he did give permission and then forgot. (In this case - especially with the wedding, is unlikely) The amount of times my grandmother has blamed my mom or one of my aunts on losing her EBT card saying that they were the last ones to have it, and then one of us proceeding to find it somewhere in her room is honestly laughable. It happens once every other month for the past 5 years or so.", "Unless I read it wrong, Dan isn\u2019t the caregiver", "Dan and his wife aren't full time care givers.

He's paying it back to his dad - not the people who keep bailing him out financially.", "I agree, the $20k she mentions giving him would be only be like... 5 months of elderly staffed rent where I live. So if he continues to care for dad when \"he needs help\" he'll have figuratively paid that back real quick.\n\nBut OP will want to make clear boundaries and divide the financial burden equally between siblings going forward.", "The OP's husband can suggest that the the executor get legal advice, which will not fall on the side of 'Dan keeps the house'. Also, the executor is *personally* liable for the decisions they make. Liability is not limited to the estate alone. If, as seems likely, it is one of the 'successful' siblings, there are more assets than just the estate at play. An executor who fails to follow the will faithfully can lose their house.\n\nIANAL, but I have shared an estate, and the jurisprudence on this all goes back to English Common law, so it's much the same in any jurisdiction based in common law tradition. Which basically means the anglosphere and most or all of the commonwealth.\n\nOTOH, if anyone lives in a place that uses the Napoleonic Code (France, Quebec, maybe Louisiana and Haiti, etc) then ignore anything I've said."]}
