Fake names.\n\nI (37 F) decided a couple months ago with my husband (40 M) that it was time to get our kids a dog because they were old enough to care for one. My kids are Rose (8 F) and Isabella (10 F). My husband had a boxer as a kid and said that he has fond memories with that kind of dog so we decided to get one and surprise the kids. He is now five months old. I'm sure many of you will understand that because he is a puppy he needs a lot of exercise because he is very high energy. We often take him on walks at the park near our house because it has several very long walking paths.\n\nWell, this past weekend there was an event going on at the lower half of the park, so it was closed off so all we had left was the top half. It was just me and my daughter Rose because my husband had to pick up Isabella from a friend's house. While at the park my daughter kept begging me to hold Coopers leash. After a while I gave in. While Rose was walking him another dog came by and Cooper got excited and started running over which pulled my daughter who let go of the leash. Cooper ran over to the other dog trying to play and all of a sudden I heard screaming at me to \"get my dog\". My daughter ran over and started crying while the girl (2oish F?) held her dog down with her arm in his mouth and screamed at me to stop standing there. The man with her started yelling at me to stop my dog who was jumping with excitement. After the shock wore off, I rushed over and removed my dog checking Cooper and Rose. The man with her started yelling at me that I was being irresponsible by letting the dog walk free in a leash required area and that people like them take their rescues there for training and I probably just destroyed months work of progress with their dog. I explained he was being held but my daughter dropped by accident and that he needed to stop yelling as it was scaring my kid. He started yelling that if my daughter wasn't strong enough to hold the dog she shouldn't be walking it or take it to a unleashed area to practice. When we got home Rose was still crying. When my husband asked what happened and I told him, he was angry at me telling me that I need to be more responsible and that I was at fault. I told my mother about it and she told me that dogs like the girls shouldn't be allowed to go to parks and I agree.

After my dog was attacked several times by loose dogs, I don't have much patience for loose dogs and do not trust them. You know that your dog is friendly and wants to play but they may not or their dog might be aggressive but is okay on leash. From their perspective, you were moving very slowly to grab your dog and were allowing him to potentially do damage to their dog. \n\nYour daughter is not yet strong enough to hold onto the leash and should not have had it. While it was good that she let go because she could have done a good deal of harm to herself by trying to hold it, she should not have been in that position in the first place.  \n\nAlso, why should they not be allowed at the park? They had their dog on a leash and it doesn't sound like the dog got loose.", "YTA. You are an irresponsible parent and dog owner.", "YTA. I work in animal rescue, and if the park requires that your animal be leashed, then you should have had him secured on his leash. The other party most likely went to the park BECAUSE there was a leash requirement and they could safely train their reactive dog. \n\nAn 8 yo cannot hold onto a half-grown boxer dog if it gets excited. This is where you pull up your big mom pants and tell her no, because it's not safe. You would have had to deal with much a much worse situation if the other dog's owners were not so careful and that dog had attacked and hurt or killed your puppy. Y", "Yta he could have reacted better sure but you created the situation,  handled it very poorly were unapologetic and clearly still don't see you were in the wrong. The only out of control animal there was your dog. And it was 100 percent your fault.", "YTA. walking a reactive rescue dog wouldn't be an issue if everyone else had good leash practices. \n\nso your kid wanted to hold the leash? that's perfectly fine if the dog behaves well and/or not strong enough to overpower your kid. but  letting your kid handle the dog when she wasn't prepared isn't much different than irresponsibly letting it off-leash. \n\nmy dog is 80lbs, and i let my partner's kid walk her sometimes. but i'm always sure to keep an eye out, and if there's anything in our path that could attract my dog (other dogs, someone on rollerskates, construction workers eating lunch, etc), i ask for the leash back until we're somewhere safe again. \n\nand that was after months of us holding the leash together, just in case. \n\nyou may feel like that lady overreacted, but honestly it was probably warranted.", "YTA\nIf your daughter cannot keep hold of the leash, she should not walk the dog.", "YTA\n\nYes your daughter dropped the lead unintentionally but it's your responsibility to keep your dog secure which might mean she doesn't get to hold him.\n\nI've an anxious rescue and once you've had so many run ins with out of control dogs, regardless of how well meaning they are, your patience wears thin. As soon  as some over excited dog comes at us I will shout at the owners to get their dog. \n\nAn untrained puppy of that age, not knowing proper manners and not respecting other dogs boundaries will cause a fight and potentially serious injury. Doesn't matter the usual character or the intentions of the dogs involved, any anxious, stressed or untrained dog can snap, and as your dog wasn't secure it would be your fault.", "No bad dogs. Just bad owners. The dog was doing what a dog does. You were negligent in your dog owning duties by letting your daughter hold the dog knowing that's she's not fully capable.\n\nIt's not hard to accept your responsibility and take accountability in this. Remember, you accosted their dog, YOU let the dog free out of your own lack of consideration for others. \n\nI'm glad your dog is safe and the other people are okay.\n\nYTA", "YTA, sorry. If your daughter can't hold the leash because the dog is stronger than her, then she shouldn't be holding the leash.\n\nPlenty of dogs are leash reactive, protective of their people, just flat out don't like other dogs, have trauma from being used as bait dogs, were poorly socialized prior to rescue due to a variety of factors, etc. It is not for you to decide how another dog should react to your puppy.\n\nYour dog did nothing wrong, the other dog did nothing wrong. The dogs are not the issue here, the people are. My own dog is trained to listen 100% to voice commands and never leaves my side, but when we are in leash areas or public spaces, she has a leash so that _everyone else_ feels comfortable around her. She's got the best manners out of every dog we meet, but the leash is for _her_ safety.\n\nGotta accept responsibility for this one lady dude.\n\nEdit: typos", "YTA. The people were right\u2026 if your daughter isn\u2019t strong enough to hold a rowdy puppy, she shouldn\u2019t get the leash. Yes, saying no makes you a bad guy to your daughter but it also prevents things like this, and worse, from happening.", "YTA, your story is full of useless information, so I believe you know you are the asshole here. The only pertinent information in this story is your dog escaped from your daughters grasp and charged another dog...   How you could believe you are not the asshole is beyond me.", "You're NTA but you need to understand most communities require leashes. I hate them and see a clearly friendly dog as okay, but there are a sh\\*\\* ton of people who dislike dogs or fear them. I really hate not letting my dog free roam but I find the places where he can do so (usually a dog park) and take my losses.", "YTA it was your dog which was not under control.", "YTA for reasons explained clearly by others. But, if your girls want to be involved in walking your dog (and I remember the huge treat it was as a kid to be allowed to hold the lead), consider using a harness to which you can attach two leads. Your daughters can feel as if they\u2019re walking the dog, but you\u2019re there just in case. Obviously, you\u2019d need to show them just how to work it so the poor dog isn\u2019t confused, but it\u2019s entirely possible as long as you\u2019re disciplined.", "Yta. Letting your 8yo hold the leash when you knew other dogs would be around is irresponsible", "YTA.... Also lucky... My care and responsibility is for my dogs only.... I'll always make sure they're safe and never hurt... But Yours is catching this boot if I have an ounce of doubt in it's intentions.", "YTA\n\nShe screamed cause you TERRIFIED her. She probably thought her dog was going to kill yours, and although it would have been your fault, she'd have had to face consequences. And as she was screaming for you to grab your dog, you took your sweet time, then stood there and made excuses.\n\nMost leash laws state that dogs have to be leashed and under the care and control of their handlers. An 8 year old with a few months of ownership is FAR too inexperienced and small to be the primary handler, and evidenced by her dropping the leash at the first sign of the dog running.\n\nYou are very much in the wrong here.  If you see that couple again, you owe them a massive apology. You also owe your daughter an apology for putting her in that position.\n\nMaybe your inexperience with dogs is a mitigating factor here, but you exhibited TERRIBLE judgement.", "ESH. You way more though. Until your daughter is physically able to handle the dog, she shouldn\u2019t be the one to hold the leash. You also don\u2019t seem to care. \n\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t have yelled at your kid.", "YTA\n\nAn 8 year old is far too young to hold the leash of a hyperactive puppy, in a public setting such as this. You really should know better and I don't care how much she whined about it, she is too little for that. \n\nSO MUCH could have gone catastrophically wrong here, including a massive dog fight, which is what it sounds like that woman was trying to prevent. How the hell do you know how reactive another dog will be? You don't! Your daughter could have been hurt, your puppy, you would have been liable for it all as your dog was running unsupervised. Yes they shouldn't have screamed at you like that, but at the same time, you completely lost control of your dog and it sounds like you didn't do much to get him because \"cute puppy\".", "YTA, if a giant dog runs up to my dog to \"play\" my dog will eat it. My dog is a wiener dog. Don't mess with him. Double leash until your kid is strong enough to manage a fully charging large dog that it will grow into. Learning opportunity. Also, dog parks are a horrible place, so many fights and bad dog owners there\n\nEdit: boxers are AH too", "ESH, but you're definitely the bigger AH in this situation.\n\nThe man is an AH for screaming at your daughter, but he's right that you shouldn't have given her the leash if she isn't strong enough to hold onto your dog. When you're out in public with your dog, you're responsible for maintaining control of him and ensuring he doesn't terrorize other people and animals.\n\nIt doesn't matter if this other girl's dog has behavioral issues. Your dog should've never been anywhere near it. You're not more entitled to a public space than anyone else is.", "YTA\n\nIf your daughter is too young to properly control the dog.

You don't let a small child walk a dog, even more, a puppy and even more in a place where traumatized dogs are socialized.

Public spaces are meant to be enjoyed by all and no one should have to worry about something like this happening when it can be avoided by simply being responsible.", "YTA... unintentionally but now you know better.  I know not to let my dog get held by anyone inexperienced because of her high prey drive. She is gentle and easy until she is not. Use A second leash if you want your kids to learn. My dog is only 70 pounds but has pulled over several adults holding the leash.\n\n\nEdit: ok you are an intentional AH. Your comments are showing how ignorant you are, and dangerous you are to your dog and daughter. \nHAVE YOUR DOG UNDER CONTROL and on leash in an on leash park. Simple", "You made a mistake. After the fact you\u2019re trying to justify your mistake by saying that if another person hadn\u2019t been trying to train their dog that your mistake would have been consequence free.\n\nYTA. Instead of realizing your error you are searching for reasons to make the people who were controlling their dog the villains. That\u2019s not how this works (unless maybe you\u2019re Tucker Carlson).", "YTA. Do better and learn from these comments so we can build safer communities for all. Dogs are great but they need routine, discipline and control regardless of age, size, breed. An 8 year old shouldn\u2019t be left to handle that.", "That man was correct - you didn\u2019t have control over your dog, because yours daughter is not in control of the dog, even on a leash. \n\nYTA \n\n\u201cMy dog is friendly\u201d is not an excuse to get your dog in a dangerous situation.", "YTA. You do not allow a child to walk an untrained dog. Your comment that he was jumping because he was excited shows that you have no control over him. \n\nOne of the responsibilities of a dog owner is to make certain that the dog is properly trained and socialized so things like this don't happen. Please invest the time and effort in training. Pay for classes if you can't manage it on your own.", "EDIT: After reading everyone else's comments, I'm going to take away the \"SOFT YTA.\"  I'm going to leave it at YTA for all the reasons the other commenters said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my mother about it and she told me that dogs like the girls shouldn't be allowed to go to parks and I agree.\n\nWait, what? \"Dogs like the girls shouldn't be allowed to go to parks.\" I hope this was a typo. Anyway, yes, YTA. Soft though. You wanted to let your daughter walk the dog, and maybe you didn't realize that she couldn't handle the dog. So, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. But now that you know she can't, do not let that happen again. You also might invest (WISELY) in some serious dog training. Your dog is old enough to learn to behave.", "Info: Did you not realize that your daughter had lost control of the puppy before the shouting started? I\u2019m really confused by the timeline of events. Your daughter lost control and then you didn\u2019t attempt to get control again until you were told to? When did the other woman\u2019s dog start biting her arm? Did she stick her arm out to keep her dog from biting your dog? If she had the time to do that where were you during this?", "NTA. I am really surprised by the responses.  I don't even like dogs.* I especially don't like dogs in public.  A boxer isn't a very large dog so, I would think that an 8 should be able to hold the leash.  Your daughter accidentally/unexpectedly lost her hold on the leash and it was able to approach another dog. It didn't attack the other dog or it's owners.  I am assuming that the other female was 20 not 2. If the other owners cannot control their dog from biting, fighting or attacking they need to be more concerned about what they are doing in their practice. You should also get you pet trained. \n\n*I would snuggle up an a baby puppy any day.", "This!!!", "I mean, it really sounds like OP did absolutely nothing to try to get her dog under control after her daughter let go of the leash, so yeah I do t at all blame them for screaming at her. If your dog starts running at another dog YOU RUN AFTER YOUR DOG AND GET IT UNDER CONTROL. You don\u2019t stand there until you hear screaming and then keep standing there until someone else starts yelling and then KEEP STANDING THERE \u201cuntil the shock wears off\u201d. The second your dog gets off leash (or gets it\u2019s leash out of a persons hand) you GO GET YOUR FUCKING DOG - signed a responsible dog owner who has owned dogs her whole life and would never in a million years ignore the dog who got off leash until someone else started yelling", "OMG - 100% YTA.  OP your comments make you sound worse. You came here asking for judgement. You got on that you were the asshole. Instead of accepting this and LEARNING from your mistake and making sure this never happens again, you keep arguing how friendly your dog was.  SMH.", "Upvoted.  \n\nSame.  Just posted an encounter my puppers that I had with aggressive loose dogs.  I am traumatized from that experience because I know how bad it could have been.  Loose dogs are a menace whether they are friendly or not.  I also have a young daughter and don\u2019t want to see a loose dog running up to us when I\u2019m out with her.  Especially a boxer or other breed that can be deemed \u2018aggressive\u2019.  Some of them will wag their tails while mauling you.  \n\nFor reference, I have a rescue with pit in her.  Not hating on breeds, but recognize what some of them can and have done.", "I'm sorry, I completely disagree. The big issue here is how damn long it took OP to get their dog back under control - so much could have gone wrong due to their negligence", "Why should the dog owner have to suffer because your dog has an irresponsible owner that thinks her small child can do things that she very obviously can\u2019t?", "Why should other dogs who have gone through trauma that wasn\u2019t their own fault not be allowed outside for walks because you can\u2019t follow the rules.\n\nAlso\u2026 your dog running up to another dog is not friendly dog behaviour. It is aggressive and plenty of perfectly nice dogs would have had a problem with your dogs behaviour.\n\nIrresponsible pet owners are the worst", "My dog has aggression issues. As a result I only take her to ON LEAD AREAS! Owners like you make it damn difficult for owners like me to keep our dogs safe.", "It doesn\u2019t matter that your dog is friendly. The point is that the other dog ISN\u2019T. The other people don\u2019t want your dog to be injured either. They weren\u2019t mad at your puppy, they were rightfully infuriated with YOU. How are you not getting this???", "A dog not listening to commands isn't a friendly dog, it's a liability. \n\nLearn to socialize your dog properly or keep him on the leash.", "Because this was an on leash area so the other dog owner shouldn't have to deal with dogs off the leash", "Because you\u2019re in an area where dogs are required to be leashed.\n\nAs a dog owner of a reactive dog, I do EVERYTHING in my power to keep my dog safe. It\u2019s dogs like yours that ruin it for everyone.\n\nOP bottom line is YOU did not control your dog, and YTA in a major way.", "Your dog was out of control as well.", "Because their dog is reactive, they won\u2019t be able to go to off leash parks. But every dog has a right (and need!) to be walked and luckily, most public areas require dogs to be on a leash. Bad dog owners who break the rules screw this up and cause danger to their own dogs as well as the dogs and owners who are following the rules. \n\nNo, you didn\u2019t anticipate that your daughter was going to drop the leash after spotting a reactive dog. If you\u2019d scrambled after your dog immediately, apologized profusely, and learned that in the future your daughter shouldn\u2019t hold the leash I\u2019d give you a N. A. H.  \n\nHowever you doubled down on how friendly your puppy is, how it\u2019s their dog\u2019s fault (even though it was leashed), and that the real problem was the yelling. \n\nYTA", "They had their dog under control. You did not.", "For some reason I read that it was off leash, but I did skim. Thx.", "I defer to your greater dog knowledge.", "This is 100% the type of dog walker I try to avoid when I go out. You are responsible for your dogs behavior, and your ability to keep your dog under control. My dog is not always friendly - if your off leash, untrained dog came running up to mine, and my dog happened to attack your dog, it would still be your fault because you couldn\u2019t be responsible and keep your dog under control. Not everybody wants to interact with your dog, and it\u2019s your job to contain it. \n\nBig YTA.", "Exactly! A lot of dogs that have aggression towards other dogs it is fear aggression or aggression from not knowing how to socialize. The responsible thing to do is gently expose them in a controlled environment- ya know? Like walking past another dog while both are contained to show they're not going to get attacked? Another dog running at this is going to scare them and cause them to respond aggressively. Not. Because they're an aggressive dangerous dog in general but because they're fucking scared!!! Yta.", "Exactly this. \n\nMy friend had a pit that a bait dog in a fighting ring before being rescued. After she proved she was good on a leash and could follow commands, my friend started taking her for walks around the neighborhood. She absolutely hated people like OP because they were putting her, her dog, and their dog at risk.", "That would be great if your feelings were the only feelings that mattered here. But here's the thing, when you're out in public you have to be considerate of others and their right to use the space too. \n\nYou thought your dog was being cute & playful, they clearly didn't see it that way. Do you not understand that others don't necessarily want your dog running up to them and jumping on them? What if it had been a small child and he jumped on them and knocked them over in his excitement? And can you imagine seeing a strange dog just running wildly up to you? You don't  know if the dog is coming to attack you or play with you until it's right on top of you, so imagine how scary that might have been. \n\nI just don't get it, are you just lacking in empathy? Can you not put yourself in their shoes? \n\nAnd lastly, if a dog has had trauma in it's life it will be very nervous and & jumpy in public and around other dogs. The last thing a dog like that needs is another dog running up to them. You don't seem to have heard what they were trying to tell you. You were in the wrong here, you dog needs to be under control when in public. A small child cannot be expected to maintain control  over a hyper dog. I think you know all this. It's hard to believe an adult of child bearing age needs to be told any of this.", "That's an interpretation that relies very heavily on knowing your dog. Many years ago  large dog came running at speed towards myself and my then-toddler. Owner says \"oh don't worry, he's just being friendly\". Not what it looked like to me and my kid was wary of big dogs for years after. \n\nYou had your dog inadequately controlled in a public place. YTA.", "Honestly\u2026 BFFR. I don\u2019t care what demeanor your dog has. My childhood dog was nearly killed by one like yours because \u2018he just wanted to play\u2019\u2026\n\nYou are a careless owner. Shame on you. Husband is right.", "My dog was attacked by another dog while she was on leash and after that incident, it didn\u2019t matter. Any time another dog came up to her while she was on leash, she reacted as if she was going to be attacked. The other dog might be friendly or not. I only took her to places where dogs were supposed to be on leash and all too often people like you ignored the rules, and set back any progress I had made with her to greet other dogs. YTA", "And it would have been your fault if your dog got injured", "Any dog rushing me or my dog in any area that is not a dog park is presumed an unfriendly dog.\n\nYour dog does not get to invade anyone\u2019s personal space- human or canine. Teaching your dog manners and being in control of him is for everyone\u2019s safety. If he had rushed up to someone who is fearful of dogs and/or has past trauma he could have been physically hurt, pepper sprayed, etc. \n\nMy pup was attacked while walking in our neighborhood (on leash) at 5 months old. A neighbor\u2019s dog ran out from his garage and charged at us down the street. We were at least two blocks from his house. Owner yelled: \u201cOh, he\u2019s friendly!\u201d No, no he wasn\u2019t. He attacked and bit my puppy and I kicked him to get him off my dog. He was not responsive to commands and evaded attempts by his owner to pick him up. He was older and a \u201cnon-aggressive\u201d breed, but it still happened due to negligence and lack of control and training. It took months for my pup to regain his confidence and not be fearful of new dogs. The next time your dog does this, he may not be so lucky. If you care for him, do right by him and train him appropriately or restrain him. \n\nThere are leashes with multiple handles. Get one. You hold the main handle and daughter holds the lower handle. There are also leashes that clip to a belt loop for extra caution. \n\nAlso, your pup is not only energetic because of his age, but also the breed. A friend of mine had a boxer with a 6 1/2 foot vertical spring jump from a complete stand still. You need to be prepared to give him the mental stimulation and physical exercise he needs to be healthy and content. Do your research and start now. Owning and training a dog is not a passive hobby.", "Imagine this: You are walking in a park and a man runs up to you and very directly enters your personal space. \"Hi! Let's be friends! Give me a hug!\" He shouts while grabbing for you. You stiffen as he approaches, step backwards as he enters your space, shout \"No! Leave me alone! Get away from me!\" He disregards all of your signs that you don't want to engage. \n\nNow, who is behaving inappropriately in this situation? Is it the woman shouting to be left alone and physically defending herself? Or is it the \"friendly guy who wants to play\" who has ignored every signal from the other party and persisted?\n\nIf your dog was really friendly, he would have read the signs from the other dog which could have been anything from the dog equivalent of polite disregard to the dog equivalent to brandishing a knife and shrieking obscenities. It sounds like this dog was more the latter type, yet your incredibly rude dog kept trying to engage in play. \n\nYour dog is rude and so are you. Do better.", "Doesn't matter if their dog was aggressIVE, your dog was the aggressOR because he instigated the situation by approaching. It doesn't matter how friendly he seems, he's an aggressor when approaching an unaware dog. And you allowed him to approach because you weren't practicing good leash safety.", "You seriously need to do some research on dog behaviour.\n\nWhat your puppy did in dog terms was aggressive. \n\nThat pet owner went out of their way to ensure the best environment possible for their dog to succeed\u2026.\n\nYou on the other hand, seemingly did no research on dog behaviour, didn\u2019t obey the park rules and think your dog is some sort of exception to the rules.\n\nJust to be clear, you were the irresponsible one here who should not be allowed in the park.\n\nAlso boxer puppies shouldn\u2019t be walked more then once a day. Their growth plates are still growing and too much exercise can impede their growth.", "Your dog was off the leash in an on leash park. Your dog was the trigger.
