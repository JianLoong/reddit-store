Either it fits or it doesn't, and as you noted, you are old enough to determine that for yourself. Her demanding to see you in it is super intrusive and very, very inappropriate.\n\nIf that's her personality, I'm not sure it will help, but I would suggest using that word with her, specifically: \"Mum, I get that you want to know if it fits, but trying on bras is hardly new to me, and there's literally nothing you can do and no input you can give as a person who is not the one wearing the bra at this point that would add insight to my experience of actually trying it on.

Around the same age, I felt like my mum literally didn't realize that I wasn't part of her - that she saw me as a limb of hers that wouldn't do she said. I was also reading lots of Freud etc at uni, and they kept talking about the trauma where a boy breaks away from identifying with his main caregiver (assumed mother) to identify with the father. My theory was, girls aren't offered that breakpoint. In a sexist / gender-role assigned society, we go from infant adoration to identifying with our mothers - no natural point to say \"No, I end here and you start there.\" And the mother doesn't have that breakpoint either. Even when the girl healthily wants to be a separate person, the mother doesn't see her as separate. \n\nI'm sure this isn't universal. Freud was writing in a heavily patriarchal society centuries ago.

I\u2019ve only asked that once after we switched bra types and when I specifically asked her if it was too tight or loose she said I don\u2019t know.

Best case scenario, she is upset because she's being faced with the fact that you're all grown up, can make decisions for yourself, and don't rely on her/ her opinions anymore.

Option 2 is you mom is more on the narcissistic side, and feels she is entitled to you/ your body still because she made you. She'll intentionally withhold things from you now to punish you for attempting independence.

I'd say age 16, it never came up again.", "NTA\n\nI saw another comment along the lines, but if she's refusing to back off, then you've got a couple of options. Either make her realize how creepy it is that she wants to see you in underwear, or just bounce the crazy back. She wants to see you in a bra? Then reciprocate. Oh, she doesn't want to do it because it's creepy and uncomfortable that you're asking? Now she knows what you've been dealing with.", "What you are describing is abuse.

And you have heard the sentence 'they grow up so fast....' There you are, not needing her anymore like you used to. But don't get me wrong: while this might be the explanation for her irrational behavior, it didn't mean you did anything wrong. You set your boundaries, and that was good. She will come around. But sometimes even parents need there time. In your age it is a good thing when the kids can leave the house for some time, making it easier to see them as adults when they come back...the process can still be the same, but you are not there to see it. If you gave the possibility to study somewhere else for a term it could be a good idea. She would probably miss you a lot and appreciate you more as an adult when you come back.", "I was in my early 20s when my mom stopped talking to me for 2 weeks; my crime?

Either way, OP definitely has the right to say no, but I could at least maybe understand mom more if it didn't fit and she was trying to see how it was not fitting to help with finding new one.", "Right? The only time I've seen my daughter in her underwear since puberty is if she feels to hot and takes off her pants while reading. (To which my response is usually, \"Seriously?? You still four?\" and then we both carry on as we were.) *Asking* to see her in her undies? Would feel seriously gross and inappropriate. Even if I do still occasionally stick colourful knickers in her Christmas stocking.", "One of my daughters is 20. I still buy her bras (not underwear. She can pick that out herself).

If she told me she didn't want me to buy them, I would stop. But all in all, there aren't a lot of 19-23 yr olds who can afford to be completely self-reliant and 2 bras can easily end up to be $100 which would be the difference between buying the bras and not having enough gas money/food money for the week.", "Maybe she has an alternative motive, like a tattoo check?", "But she wouldn\u2019t ask you to model it for her.", "Nope.

It's like they have \"non-bodies.\" Seeing someone else's body would cause me to feel one way or another. Seeing theirs is just neutral/nothing. The only thing I feel is protective.
