I understand that she cares but I\u2019m an adult who is not comfortable with showing my body (which I told her), but she kept screaming and being pushy. I told her no and that I am an adult that knows if a bra fits or not. I was uncomfortable and I told her to let me be an adult and make my own decisions. I didn\u2019t talk to her the rest of the day, mostly due to me being stuck in my room doing assignments for university.\nIts the next day and It\u2019s dinner, I wanted to make myself garlic sauce the way my mum makes it so I asked her how to make it.

At 19, I have to assume that you've been wearing bras for at least a few years. There's literally NO LOGICAL REASON why she NEEDS to get a visual of you in it. Either it fits or it doesn't, and as you noted, you are old enough to determine that for yourself. Her demanding to see you in it is super intrusive and very, very inappropriate.\n\nIf that's her personality, I'm not sure it will help, but I would suggest using that word with her, specifically: \"Mum, I get that you want to know if it fits, but trying on bras is hardly new to me, and there's literally nothing you can do and no input you can give as a person who is not the one wearing the bra at this point that would add insight to my experience of actually trying it on.

At this point in your life I'm sure you've been wearing a bra long enough to know if it fits properly...weird.", "NTA. You are correct, this is a ridiculous thing to get mad about. Since you live there you\u2019ll know best to just let it blow over or gently bring it up. \u201cMom I appreciate your thoughtful gift but it\u2019s not necessary or comfortable for me to show you how my underwear fits.\u201d I personally find it a little odd she would take it upon herself to buy you a bra, that\u2019s a pretty personal choice and I would not expect anyone to know my requirements for fit/style.", "Nta. Is your mum always like that? Seems an odd thing to get up in arms over.", "NTA, you set a boundary, she needs to learn to accept it.  It's not an unreasonable boundary, and there was no malice behind it.\n\nSounds like mommy is a bit overbearing though, hopefully you can afford to move out on your own soon.", "I mean I get it. My mom used to ask to see if my bra fit but when I got older that stopped. Whoever I go shopping with for a new bra usually sees it so I can make a good choice on whether it fits good for my boob type and looks good on me. I still show my mom my bra sometimes when I get a new one and I love it, so it\u2019s not too weird to me. But you told her you were not comfortable with showing her even though you are family and she kept pushing.

You're 19, your mum needs to respect boundaries and stop demanding to see you in your underwear, that's weird.", "NTA\nI afford my nine year old daughter all the privacy she wants even though she's not hit puberty because body autonomy and consent are everything. If she wants to get changed in private or doesn't want me seeing her in her underwear, I respect that. Your mum's in the wrong here.", "NTA - your mom is just realizing that you're growing up and she doesn't have the same control that she used to. she's handling it wrong. instead of accepting the fact that you're figuring things out for yourself, she's having a tantrum that only shows her fear of losing you to adulthood. (that's my guess as a 48 year old mother, to a 17 year old son, and i have these occassional pains myself. i'm powering thru and letting him forge his way, but i don't think your mom is seeing it this way yet.) talk to her!!", "NTA\nThe only reason that your mom may be justified is this is a way of coping as a mother soon having her child leave the nest, but even then she shouldn\u2019t vent that frustration on you. I have a mother that does the same thing on occasion although not nearly as bad, so my best advice is to try and be patient for her to simmer and just continue being an adult\n\nEdit: my man\u2019s right, it wouldn\u2019t be justified necessarily, it just explains the behavior.

I don't understand why she wanted to see so badly", "NTA why do mom\u2019s do this? My mom also gets weird if I ask for privacy like that. She genuinely doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m in the room and will just change her clothes or pull up her shirt to ask me to check medical things, but I don\u2019t get why it offends them to hear their adult child decline to do the same.", "NTA.\n\nI think your mother's just sad she's losing part of your childhood role and is worried about what her role will be now, whether she's still relevant.
