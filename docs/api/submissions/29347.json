Def not the asshole.", "NTA.  I\u2019m wondering myself what her game plan is.  She knows good and damn well exactly how much sex you are not having, so her indignation was misplaced and bullshit on of that.", "NTA But I think you should address this issue with your sex life in couple's counseling. \nYou took a week long romantic anniversary trip and didn't have sex at all?", "NTA.  \n\nShe's not being honest with you, saying one thing but doing another.  She's angry because you called her on her bullshit, but it's still a fair criticism.\n\nIMO, don't have kids.  Things won't improve.", "NTA because you've put up with way too much not to be a bit sarcastic about things, but talk about missing your chance to have a deep conversation about it that could result in you actually having sex regularly. \n\nHaving said that, a sex life is pretty important to a marriage. That sort of intimacy is hard to come by if you aren't sexually active in a normal sense. You may want to consider that the two of you are not as compatible as you think you are. \n\nI would say there is a good chance that your wife would be on board with having sex a lot to start having children, but once she has the kids she wants, she will likely go back to her current ways, or worse, she just won't want sex at all. The kids will become her perfect excuse to never have sex again. \n\nIf you can't work out why your wife has no interest, I'd say it's not likely to ever really get better. It might be best to pull the plug.", "NTA, just maybe read the room wrong and touched on some insecurity. Even though you\u2019re NTA, you should still apologize and verbalize to her that you clearly made her feel bad. I\u2019m sure she will come around", "NTA it's harsh but true. For the sake of your relationship I think it would be good to apologise but explain to her your frustrations and explore solutions. Therapy and the like.", "The comment was somewhat assholic but I understand why you made it. I'm sure your wife does, too. Though, I think it would be a good idea to talk to her about why you said what you did, that you were triggered, etc. My concern, though, is the idea of bringing a child into a relationship that is clearly not a happy one. There is a big underground river of discontent on your part that your wife is choosing to ignore. Have you considered going to couples counseling to discuss what's going on? It's not okay that your needs aren't being met.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If she is still sour... apologize, but ask her if she understans that making a baby involves at least weekly  sex for up to a year for many people. Those, that get it in couple of months are exceptions. Getting lucky on one go is a fluke. Tell her, that un less she comes clean about what her issue with sex is, it's simply not happening...", "lol that is funny", "She will not improve, she will not get better. As a man with 30 years of a dead bedroom behind him, I know, so you need to decide. Is sex important enough for you guys to break up. I chose one way and it has its benefits, you need to do the same. But don't think it'll magically get better and when kids come along you will get nothing, ever. Are you prepared to do that?", "Soft NTA\n\nYour wife could be Asexual, which means she has little to no sexual desire, (a quick google will tell you about it), and this makes it very difficult to engage in sexual activity.\n\nThat being said, your response to her question was perfectly understandable, if a bit insensitive.  Your wife is fully aware that she is not sexually inclined and might even feel guilty about it, hence her reaction to your comment.\n\nIf you do want children, then you need to have a discussion about the fact that she will need to have regular sex on a monthly basis and how you are going to achieve this.", "Perhaps instead of worrying about your wife in the bedroom, you might worry about yourself. Some positions are actually very painful for many women. Ask her what she needs.", "NTA \n\nYou're understandably frustrated.\n\nDoes your wife have depression or a hormone imbalance? Is she ace? I'm wondering if you guys have explored possible reasons for the missing spark.", "NTA because I understand you're frustrated. \n\nBut this seems to be a sore spot for both of you. Sometimes joking about it can be hurtful.\n\nYou have said in your comments that you both have depression and anxiety. Some meds reduce your libido to practically 0, especially combined. Has she talked to her doctor about this problem? Sometimes it's awkward or something people overlook considering the bigger picture (the diagnosis and other \"worse\" symptoms) but it's something to consider.\n\nAlso, you said you have been to therapy. Have you been together to a therapist that specializes in sex? You can do both and see if you can improve, even if slowly.", "NTA\n\nYes, it is her right to say no and you're obligated to respect that, but at this point I'm just not sure why you guys are married.\nIf you divorced and just decided to be friends or even housemates and searched for romance elsewhere, absolutely nothing will change.\nI don't know why she doesn't want to have intimacy with you, and it doesn't have to be your fault, as a woman that just absolutely HATES physical contact, I know that I'm just not capable of having sex and decided to just not get married, it's not fair to trap someone in a marriage, then refuse completely to be intimated with them, and in result forbidding them from having sex with anyone at all, s3x twice a year is just no sex at all.\nI'm not sure how she expects herself to have a baby without having sex, she needs a reality check and you gave her one.\nAGAIN I totally belive it's her right to say no and that you HAVE to respect that, but THIS is just.. wrong.", "NTA but your relationship isn\u2019t going anywhere if you can\u2019t get your sexual needs met. It\u2019s a huge part of my marriage \u201cemotional contract\u201d and if my husband changes that \u201ccontract\u201d then I get to call for renegotiations. I hope you let her know that the sarcasm is hiding pain. And maybe see a doctor to get her hormones checked and figure out why her drive is so low.", "This absolutely won\u2019t get better if you have kids. Personally, I couldn\u2019t live like this. If you\u2019re truly happy then you\u2019re also signing up to very little sex throughout your life. I wonder if your wife has any sexual interests that she hasn\u2019t shared with you yet? What really gets her going?", "NTA. That shit was pretty funny.\n\nOn another note, only having sex a couple times a year at 30 and being married is insanely unfortunate. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re sexually compatible and doesn\u2019t seem like a recipe for long term happiness if you have to constantly coax her to be sexual.", "Unknowingly marrying a semi-asexual person is hardly a small thing. I\u2019m speaking as someone who was in a similar relationship for 20+ YEARS (due to kids).\n\nIf you do truly love her, perhaps explore why she\u2019s so sexually repressed. Sexual trauma? Religious upbringing? Lack of experience?  Belief that sex is for a man\u2019s pleasure?\n\nNot to be crude, but has she ever even had an orgasm? (My ex certainly has not - still true, quite regrettably, but also quite common). If so, does she pleasure herself? If not, why? \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible she was raised that sex is about pleasing your man rather the a shared orgasmic response. Maybe give her a few nights that are \ud83d\udcaf% about her pleasure, not yours. Not necessarily orgasm related as much as extended intimate contact like a sensual massage.\n\nThat said, I regretfully feel your pain. Ouch.", "Nope, got the same \u201ctomorrow night\u201d every night", "This is so true, it's incredibly unlikely their sex life will improve after having kids.", "It can barely get worse\u2026.", "> I\u2019m sure she will come around\n\nAfter all, it's only been four years", "Yes, we both have depression and anxiety and decided to do therapy after couples counseling a few years ago.\n\nAnd we have discussed it many times why buy it\u2019s always a moving target.", "Possible reasons include she just doesn't want to have sex with him because she feels that marriage is about security", "Well... A man who will stay with a woman who is up for sex for 2 times a year must be pretty low libido himself... They may be more compatible than people think. I do wonder what he considers adequate sex life? BUT... There is something brewing with her and the promises that it \"will get better\" that just isnt happening are off. There is something she is not being honest about.", "maybe she feels fat"]}
