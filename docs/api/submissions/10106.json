Sure for a lot of jobs having to take a week off with only two weeks' notice might not be a problem, but for a lot it would be. What if she's in the middle of a big project with some tight deadlines? What if she doesn't have enough PTO or they already had it earmarked for something else later in the year? What if her job schedules vacation on a seniority system months in advance? What if she doesn't even want to go to wherever this is he's planned without asking? \n\nOverall I agree that everyone should try to enjoy ife and put that first over work but two weeks is very short notice for a lot of working people.

I must have missed that in your OP, and was just offering my differing perspective.", "That's not accurate. She said he takes time off and goes camping, doing things he wants to do with his life, where work is a means to live. However, OP just says she \"can't wrap her mind around why he didn't ask her first,\" which is totally different. \n\nLike I said, she's not an AH for wanting a heads up, you'll note I didn't give a Y T A judgment. It's just concerning that her husband's reaction is one of despair and frustration, which makes it sound like he's not happy in the relationship.

Like, live a little.", "If that's the case, then it's fine! I understand there are caveats to every argument. I'm in a managerial role and I need to give a decent amount of heads up if I want to take time off, so I know what you mean. But OP didn't say that.

This instance is not the issue, I've already said that twice. I'm only saying it appears to be part of a pattern of behaviour on OPs part.\n\nLook, when your partner is mad at you, or you're mad at them, there has to be a willingness on both ends to self scout. Why does the other person feel the way they feel? Did you contribute to their being upset? How does the way they act impact you or make you feel? How can you come to a common ground? That's a partnership, not saying \"well, you need to be spontaneous all the time\" or \"well, you need to give me six months notice at all times.\" Abusive relationships live in the space where one partner makes excessive demands of the other without care for their feelings. If both are to be happy, the partnership needs to be mutually fulfilling. OPs partner's reaction was childish and rude, but speaks to a larger issue that we haven't been given the whole picture of. \n\nI'd rather be with my partner and jobless than be highly employed and divorced.

Instead of being thankfully, you're being nasty and said, \"you did not attain my approval prior, so I choose to make this not succeed.\" That is a total YTA move.  This feels like you're just mad because you're not the one calling the shots.\n\nIf you think this is a nice vacation you would probably enjoy, but you TRULY cannot take time from work, could you work things out to find a way to move things a little.\n\nThe problem is the tone I see in your email.

Maybe if you were just dating and he was planning to engage I could understand why he was trying to do this big gesture, but you are married and he doesn't understand how life works.", "YTA asshole for marrying an idiot!", "Not even having a job, but having a life.

I get the feeling OP is stressed out a lot and maybe isn\u2019t seeing the forest from the trees.

You can surprise someone by making a nice unexpected meal, or taking them out for a mani-pedi, but a unilateral plan to go on a week-long trip without even knowing if they're available to go is selfish. Just because it's \"a surprise\" doesn't mean you get props for that", "Why do you assume that she doesn't know her job and work load well enough to make a decision without checking with the office?  I have projects that I am in charge of.  I wouldn't need to check with my boss to see if I could take vacation when a major deliverable is due to the client.  I would know better than to even entertain the idea.  It's my responsibility, not my colleagues', to meet my deadlines and it would be career suicide to ask to take a spontaneous vacation instead of fulfilling my obligations.

She's an independent woman and I wouldn't dare try and manage her boss behind her back.\n\nMost jobs require a 2 weeks notice, which it sounds like her husband planned for. Obviously not every job is like that, and maybe her job is just really busy right now. But it sounds to me like he was attempting to be considerate.", "Context matters.  I could take vacation with 2 days. \n\nI would be surprised the husband is completely oblivious to his wife's job.  Maybe he is, and that's a bigger, different problem. \n\nThis feels like a power play.", "I don't know if that's most companies. Or maybe in USA. I live in Europe and have never worked anywhere that needed two weeks notice. A week has been enough in many places or for a shorter vacation just a couple of days. I once worked in a place where you needed to give so much how long your vacation was.

I told him I had a work conference and asked him to take off 3 days while I was \u201cgone\u201d to take care of our daughter, but actually booked the two of us a trip. Then I told my mom about the surprise trip and arranged for her to actually watch our daughter. \n\nThat was in January 2020 for a May 2020 trip, so it didn\u2019t even end up happening and now I can\u2019t use that excuse again without him being suspicious.", "Sounds like your scenario and Ops are different.

His gf just found out where they live so he needs his wife out of town?", "Based on this, it could be a NAH. Let's try a generous read of the situation (usually a good approach for any long lasting relationship). In his mind, he planned this trip for the two of you to connect and have fun together. He put effort into doing something nice, in a style that's familiar to him. He probably had a fantasy of a spontaneous, romantic trip in mind. Could it have been a sweet but misguided gesture? \n\nHe needs to learn and accept that you're not going to be the spontaneous trip partner. That's not your style, there's nothing wrong with that and he was wrong to criticize you for it. He'll have to rely on his friends for spontaneous trips and it sounds like you're cool with that, which is great. But it seems  like it was a sign of his love for you that he wanted to include you in that part of his life that he clearly enjoys. Acknowledging that piece of it will prob make it easier for you guys to get past this and grow from it.", "We have a bit of an argument going on above; is the cost of a 6 day vacation - hotel, restaurants, entertainment, etc. - something that you can easily afford out of pocket and not think twice about it?", "Oof. That\u2019s the kind of disconnect that ends relationships.", "Definitely seems more a personality thing to me, judging by her responses her relationship may be verging on coercive. Hopefully not and he learns he can't order her around like this and things improve.", "Most adults won\u2019t spring a trip on someone they supposedly love and who they already kind of know won\u2019t be able to join. And then to be upset because his \u201cgrand gesture\u201d wasn\u2019t well received only adds to my suspicion that the spouse in question is a child.", "That's exactly the point the comment you're responding to is trying to make. Prioritize your personal life and partner, and your job after. Not doing that doesn't mean you don't take pride in your work. Switch off once in a while. Enjoy your life outside of the sterile office walls.", "Right, he did give her two weeks to put in some vacation notice. OP should do better in explaining this as she is just \u201cvery busy\u201d to have reacted like this.

If it is just normal \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d at work stuff, when do you have time for a vacation? Is it ever? Has hubs been trying to get you to plan a vacation with him but you never do?

One implies you can't be trusted to handle your own schedule, the other implies you have a good marriage and you're prioritizing them over your job.\n\nObviously every career is different, and I'm not saying that it isn't the case for OP either.

We work under multiple contracts with other companies so my company needs to have an idea of the staff numbers so they can communicate that to the companies we are contacted during their monthly meetings. If it was an emergency, yeah I could leave, and if I found people to cover me I could leave, but it puts the company in a tighter position of I don't give them good notice.", "Two weeks is the bare minimum in the us.

Demanding someone take extended time off on short notice with no clue if they even have that flexibility is a massive fuck up, even more so when money has been spent to do it.", "Except that he only gave her two weeks heads-up, making it unlikely she\u2019d be able to go since most jobs will want *way* more notice than that for a full week off.\n\nOPs TA for that alone. Then compounded it by getting pissy that op has adult responsibilities.", "My husband did this but he told me he had something planned and I should take the week off WELL in advance. I\u2019m a lawyer and my husband knows what my work schedule is like - i think spouses should be aware of this!\n\nSo I got it off from work and was bursting at the seams trying to figure out what was happening. The anticipation was delicious and I knew I had something cool to look forward to during very tough periods at work (my husband has excellent taste in gift going). Husband would not tell me and put the expenses on one of the cards we don\u2019t use so I couldn\u2019t snoop. There is a way to be thoughtful and surprising. Not hard. \n\nWe talk about our projects, stresses and deadlines regularly. Right now I know he has massive deadlines in March and June and so we have something special planned together in July. Communication is key to a healthy marriage I believe. Even when it comes to surprises!\n\nEdit: money for us is not an issue as it might be in this post as my husband and I are both diligent budgeters. \n\nIn conclusion, for this post NTA", "I highly doubt it's all planned. Maybe he booked the hotel and flights, but I have no doubt that literally everything else will fall on OP to put together at the last minute. Arranging childcare and house/pet sitters, shopping for anything they'll need on the trip, picking up prescriptions, dealing with their cell phone and credit card companies for overseas travel, all that will almost certainly fall on OP. Someone who springs a last minute vacation on you isn't worrying about details, and someone who throws a pissbaby tantrum that you aren't grateful about it doesn't care about the burden they're putting on you.", "I'm thinking, would it have killed her to get swept up in the excitement and tried to get the time off?

He'd apologize for getting carried away and behaving childishly, and work with OP to plan a vacation that works for both of them. It sounds to me like he just assumes OP's work and plans are less important than his and should take a backseat to whatever he wants to do.", "Umm not really. I disagree that she should drop everything or make up a reason to be off if it causes her anxiety. My compromise with my spouse came from us talking about it well in advance.

He automatically assumes that his wife's work and plans are less important than his, and that makes him TA.", "If this is the first time it's come up, they don't have a roadmap.

At the time I was living in a different country for work (New Zealand) and he was in the USA. He said he was really busy for work but I was burnt out so he said he would do something nice for me and insisted I take a week off. I agreed work had gotten too much. He said he would try to find me some cool stuff to do that week off around town and book it for me from abroad. My brain was fried and I agreed. I told him the only thing I need is a very long massage and sauna session. \n\nInstead he turned up on my doorstep and we went on a week long vacation to the South Island. We stayed at a lovely lakefront property and did all the things to fill my very empty cup. The first day I had a spa day for 6 hours while he slept in and recovered from jet lag \ud83d\ude02 It was bliss. \n\nBeing long distance for significant periods of our relationship has been very tough but we survived and have been in the same place now for over 3 years!\n\nI\u2019ve been dying to return the favour and I\u2019m in the same boat with him.
