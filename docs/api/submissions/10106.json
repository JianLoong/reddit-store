He used trips and vacation as a form to fix everything and he feels he can\u2019t relax from work if he\u2019s in the same city as work. So I had go along with his chaos.", "Okay, gotcha. So it sounds like he's just able to do this for himself and likes to plan trips on short notice. I get that. But he definitely needs to understand that not everyone operates on his level.

Its not about good or bad companies, its about the respect one has for their team and their job role.", "I am confused as to why you're digging down on this. I would say that probably the majority of people have inflexible work schedules, regardless of field. If you work in the service industry, retail, if you're a mechanic, if you're a teacher, if you have an office job--most of these professions require more than a couple week's notice of vacation time. There are some lucky people out there who have a very flexible work schedule, but that isn't the norm. And if you think it's the norm, congrats! You're one of the lucky people. Most of us have to plan vacations well in advance.", "Okay you pick out all the jobs that wouldn\u2019t be able to give a two weeks notice all day long.

Fact of the matter is we don\u2019t know what OP does. So either she\u2019ll have to reschedule the vacation or not. It\u2019s not a big deal. Why are you so angry?", "We know she said she can't go. You are the one who is stomping around telling people off, but you think people who reply to your weirdly aggressive energy are the angry ones? Its a big deal to her because her husband is acting out based on her response and she posted here.", "You got the aggressive energy lady not me.", "That's silly, I am giving you explicit examples of why 2 weeks notice isn't sufficient to take a week off and you can't even take in information because you seem like you're frothing about how there isn't a reason she can't go and if she can't then reschedule. You're livid she even posted or?"]}
