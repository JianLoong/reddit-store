Like\u2026 \u201cI did something bad so I\u2019m going to surprise my partner with something I find nice but I\u2019m too self centered to think about their point of view on it?\u201d Maybe I\u2019m reading too much Reddit\u2026", "Honestly would seem to me like the trip was planned for him and someone else who dropped out, given the suddenness and his sulk.", "Why do I not understand this?", "but this wasn't two weeks it was six days", "She said she\u2019s busy so it may not be the right time to take off if it\u2019s going to cause her to feel more stressed and have even more on her plate when she returns. My wife planned a lovely trip for us this week and our agreement is that I do 2 hours of work in the mornings to ensure that my project stays on track and the rest of the time is spent in vacation mode. I would not be able to relax knowing that I was going to miss the deadline and sully a project that I\u2019m extremely proud of that will help me meet my goals. It\u2019s ok to take pride in your work.", "OP said it wouldn't work for her job. For this sub to work you mostly have to believe what OPs say, barring their accounts not making sense.", "OP is not prioritizing work over him. She clearly says that he does this all the time because his work is super flexible and he doesn\u2019t have to plan in advance like she does.", "There's some pretty big caveats in your statement. Sure for a lot of jobs having to take a week off with only two weeks' notice might not be a problem, but for a lot it would be. What if she's in the middle of a big project with some tight deadlines? What if she doesn't have enough PTO or they already had it earmarked for something else later in the year? What if her job schedules vacation on a seniority system months in advance? What if she doesn't even want to go to wherever this is he's planned without asking? \n\nOverall I agree that everyone should try to enjoy ife and put that first over work but two weeks is very short notice for a lot of working people. I sure as shit would need more lead time for that much time off.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

My boss now, if my wife booked a surprise vacation for us, would be so happy for me and would kick my butt if I didn't go. My boss before her though was a different story.", "Yes, I took my husband to Indonesia for his 40th for 3 weeks. Saved for a year. Booked the time off secretly with his company. They made some excuse about not having the time.off board out anymore. That being said i did tell him at Christmas which gave him almost 2 months notice as well.", "Exactly. My job has a policy of 'length of vacation' x4. I definitely couldn't take a 1-week holiday with only 2 weeks notice unless resourcing shows me as being completely free for that week.", "This is pretty extreme for a surprise vacation...it sounds like it's all planned and OP just needed to figure out time off.  This ain't a \"massive fuck up wrapped as a gift\"", "True, for some people it's not a lot of money. But 6 days in a hotel, plus presumably 6 days of eating in restaurants and visiting attractions/shopping, we are still talking at least a couple grand. You have to be pretty solid at 29 years old to casually spend this.", "I mean if you have a negative outlook on life you'd probably think like this", "Just bc HE\u2019S got a flexible job doesn\u2019t mean you do. \nHis Ahole response to your polite reasoning & suggestions was to get mad at you, ridicule you and start name calling.  \nHe\u2019s a jerk, albeit a SPONTANEOUS one, but def still a jerk.", "So? I have way more flexibility than my partner in my job and I don\u2019t plan trips when he is working in the middle of the week. It\u2019s called being considerate, your husband IS NOT considerate. He\u2019s very much a dick for getting mad for planning something outside your availability just because he felt like it.", "oh yeah, I don't know where I got 2 weeks from", "Sure assuming that op is easily replaceable in their job and they have no other responsibilities besides their job", "Well then if you\u2019ve made it clear that you don\u2019t like this sort of thing, it was a boneheaded choice for him to make. I must have missed that in your OP, and was just offering my differing perspective.", "That's not accurate. She said he takes time off and goes camping, doing things he wants to do with his life, where work is a means to live. However, OP just says she \"can't wrap her mind around why he didn't ask her first,\" which is totally different. \n\nLike I said, she's not an AH for wanting a heads up, you'll note I didn't give a Y T A judgment. It's just concerning that her husband's reaction is one of despair and frustration, which makes it sound like he's not happy in the relationship. It leads me to suspect OP routinely prioritizes her routine and work over spending time together and doing fun stuff.\n\nWhy are we killing ourselves to work when the REASON we work is to afford to go on a week-long vacation without going into debt or losing your house? Like, live a little.", "If that's the case, then it's fine! I understand there are caveats to every argument. I'm in a managerial role and I need to give a decent amount of heads up if I want to take time off, so I know what you mean. But OP didn't say that. They just said \"I can't just take a leave from work like that and that I won't be going, since I'm very busy at the moment.\" That's an incredibly dismissive thing to say to your partner who's excited about something they want to share with you.", "it depends a ton on the job. i could take a surprise trip. i have friends for whom a weekend trip requires a month of advance planning.", "To be fair we live in a high tech / corporate bubble so I understand that\u2019s not everyone. But without those details from OP hard to judge how hurtful it\u2019s for their budget.", "You could really easily make the arguement that they\u2019re not easily replaceable and so they can leverage that as needing time off.", "She is also frustrated. She is simply asking for more notice, not to never go on vacation. It\u2019s not an unreasonable request.", "I already agreed with you that it's not an unreasonable request, and that she has the right to be annoyed. This instance is not the issue, I've already said that twice. I'm only saying it appears to be part of a pattern of behaviour on OPs part.\n\nLook, when your partner is mad at you, or you're mad at them, there has to be a willingness on both ends to self scout. Why does the other person feel the way they feel? Did you contribute to their being upset? How does the way they act impact you or make you feel? How can you come to a common ground? That's a partnership, not saying \"well, you need to be spontaneous all the time\" or \"well, you need to give me six months notice at all times.\" Abusive relationships live in the space where one partner makes excessive demands of the other without care for their feelings. If both are to be happy, the partnership needs to be mutually fulfilling. OPs partner's reaction was childish and rude, but speaks to a larger issue that we haven't been given the whole picture of. \n\nI'd rather be with my partner and jobless than be highly employed and divorced. OP can make whatever choice works for them, but they can't just have it their own way all the time.", "I\u2019m sorry but as much as I love my wife, she doesn\u2019t get to dictate the trajectory of my career or what makes me anxious. Our compromise is that we plan in advance and that I\u2019m an active participant in it. There are blocked off periods where she knows that I cannot travel and will be working late because it\u2019s important to me. It\u2019s ok to not be ambitious but that\u2019s a choice not a requirement.", "You literally just said that you compromise. That is the premise of my entire argument. I'm confused as to why you keep repeating the same thing I said in a different way, while asserting that I'm wrong.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being ambitious! But if that's the only thing that drives you, there are a million stories of a million marriages that end because one partner refuses to prioritize the other.  There's nothing wrong with not being ambitious, unless your planned trajectory weighs down your partner and breeds resentment. OP and her partner have to meet in the middle or drift apart. The latter is already clearly happening for OP.", "The compromise is exactly what OP is asking for, advanced notice before any plans are made. This isn\u2019t a new request so it appears the husband is unwilling to compromise on spontaneity that doesn\u2019t take his spouse into consideration."]}
