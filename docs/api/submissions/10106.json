Now they're being called ungrateful for not wanting to go on a trip to somewhere they didn't wan to go to, at a time when they can't go, AND not be able to get what they DID want (or maybe even need).", "I spend too much time on here haha now everything is weaponized incompetence and/or cheating.", "> and you must provide a death certificate to take them.\n\nYou need to find a new job. Any company that pull that shit deserves to go out of business.", "Everybody wants to rule the world", "That derailed train spewing nasty chemicals is like 22 miles from there.  I had to look it up because so many of the nearby towns in the reports sounded familiar.  :(", "And the boss is like \u201cwait, if you\u2019re his wife, who is Angie\u201d?", "I\u2019ve had a couple of assistants whose spouses did that. In the moment it was actually pretty sweet and they were very appreciative when they found out.", "Yeah that\u2019s fine it doesn\u2019t need to be immediate. You can submit retroactive and then the days off don\u2019t get deducted from vacation days.", "A nice surprise is taking a WEEKEND trip. Booking something during a work week is insane. NTA.", "NTA. Surprise, long, last-minute vacations don\u2019t work for grown ups with jobs. Like, most of us can\u2019t just not go to work for a week with almost no notice. I get that your husband was trying to do something nice, but what fantasy world is he living in?", "I had 3 months of vacation.  I put in for one Friday off when my child got married.  Company refused it so I called in sick and went to the wedding.  The reason my request was denied?  My manager and his buddy had football  tickets for a Sunday home game but decided to make it a weekend when they learned I had asked for time off.  \nThings did not go well for them.  Upper management called me into HR first.  Then the two buddies were called in.  The manager was demoted, buddy was transferred.  He actually bragged that he had denied every request I had made for vacation time for several years.", "NTA, for over 20 years I worked a job that I could not just take a week off at.   What he could have done is set up a packaged and surprised you and let you pick the date.", "NTA- Your position was the responsible one to take. His 'spontaneous' nature is also not feasible at times. That surprise wasn't a good one...mutual discussion and agreement is much sweeter than having a trap sprung on you at basically next to no notice.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t be living life around work. You should be living life and that\u2019s what your husband is trying to show you!", "NTA - I'd be pissed if I had no input on a trip's details, and with OUR money", "I\u2019ve worked jobs where a six day vacation from work would require a 3 month advance request. This is unreasonable. There\u2019s also some red flags here re: finances. NTA", "I need more into here. How did the conversation actually go? Was he demanding about the vacation or does he really think he did a nice thing? Are you refusing ONLY because he planned this without talking to you about it? I honestly think two weeks is a fair amount of notice for a surprise trip. It\u2019s not like he came home and said \u201cwe\u2019re leaving tomorrow!\u201d  Every job I\u2019ve had is happy with two weeks notice for a week vacation. And what exactly did you say and what tone was used? \n\n\nI have to honestly say without knowing full details of the conversation that was had I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. it sounds like your husband wanted to do something nice for you thinking you\u2019d be happy.", "YTA. Instead of responding with glee and enthusiasm at his surprise . You chastise him for not asking . His gift was a grand romantic gesture and you ruined it", "NTA, you are an adult with responsibilities. He needs to respect you enough to take that into consideration. Does he respect you at all?", "NTA - a weekend getaway is a nice surprise. Expecting you to suddenly take a week off, especially when you are busy is not.", "ESH\n\nYou explained to him about work, but you could have at least checked first.  Maybe they would let you go.\n\nBut, on the other hand, he wants you to potentially lose your job for a vacation. 2 weeks notice of a request isn't normally enough.\n\nI'm assuming he had already requested HIS time off before booking the trip.", "YTA life is short  Enjoy what the person who loves you did to show you that life is worth living for the moment because tomorrow is never guaranteed", "NTA.  My husband tried to pull a similar stunt, casually mentioning, \u201cWhen we\u2019re in Europe\u2026\u201d and yeah, never asked me if I wanted to go, could get the time off, thought we could afford it.  My busiest time and work and he expected me to just to drop everything and go \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nIf he *really* wanted to do this as a nice surprise, he should have, I don\u2019t know, *contacted your boss???* Like, what 1990s romcom is he living in?", "God I hate surprises. NTA. You have every right to want to plan when you are going. Ideally where too but I can see it as acceptable to most to say \u201cI want to take you away somewhere as a surprise when suits?\u201d I\u2019d hate it but some people might not. But to not ask you if you are free before booking stinks as not thinking your time/job is important & that you bend to his schedule.", "NTA I give your husband 10 out of 10 for effort but minus a million for failure to think it through.", "Something that people who love to just impulsively do things don\u2019t factor in is how much some people enjoy the anticipation of a happy event.", "NTA. Your husband ITA.", "You may not be the \u201cA\u201d word, but you may qualify for the \u201cB\u201d word!  He told you, he told you enough about it. He told you enough where you could get ready. You could\u2019ve asked him for what days and then you could\u2019ve gone to your boss with that, but there was a way to have made this work, so yeah, I would\u2019ve slammed that door right off its hinges.  If he goes on his trip alone, he may not end up alone if you catch my drift   You screwed up \u2014 you trip too much (no pun intended).", "NTA, while some people might be thrilled at a surprise vacation, and have the capacity to take one on short notice, you are not one of them... which he should know ideally. Hopefully he cools down and realizes his mistake here.", "Are you volunteering to pay OP's bills if she loses her job?", "Two weeks notice isn't enough time, especially because OP is a prosecutor. She doesn't set her schedule. The court does.", "Wanting time to actually properly schedule time off isn't putting her work first. It's just making sure she still has a job to come back to.", "It's not a kind gesture if it completely fucks her over.", ">Like what is so special about what\u2019s happening at work 3 weeks from now that you can\u2019t miss?\n\nOP is a prosecutor. She has no control over her work schedule.", "I don\u2019t work there currently. But I worked in the hospital system in NYC for 10 years and that was the standard.", "NTA. Mainly because your husband should be aware how you would feel about a surprise vacation.", "Not enough info about your relationship dynamic/background to answer", "You are NTA if you cannot get the time off. Though you should appreciate that he was trying to surprise you. If people always ask, there is never any surprises.", "He should have checked with work for you if he was going for a surprise. But if he really didn't consider your work first, then NTA.  \n\nThat said, I would love for my husband to surprise me with time away, all arranged. But he would be smart enough to clear it with work for me.", "Nta", "Yeah so just fucking drop anything n everything you had going on! NTA", "NTA.  Things like this have to be discussed. He is a grown man who I assume is in the workforce. He has to know you have to get some sort of clearance even if you're the boss.", "I can\u2019t figure out if she can\u2019t actually get off work or she is just saying that because she\u2019s mad that her husband didn\u2019t ask her.", "YTA. No time like the present. Live a little work will be there when you return.", "NTA but I'm sure he was hoping it would be a nice romantic gesture.   People calling him selfish, or that he doesn't value her work, or that it's a secret play to be able to take a lover is just wild.  There's nothing that can't be turned into a harsh negative these days.", "Errrr Nta work doesn\u2019t work that way where you leave whenever", "YTA", "My husband actually surprised me with a trip.  But he talked to my boss about it beforehand, before he ever booked it, and made sure I would be able to be off work at the time.\n\nIt was incredibly sweet!", "Some people have responsibilities they can't just hand over to someone else without a hell of a lot of prior notice, I'm absolutely baffled that people think OP should just be spontaneous every once in a while and to hell with her employers and anyone who is relying on her.", "So you think it's a good idea for someone that's easily replaceable to skip work for a week?", "That's just being ridiculously naive, with some jobs you can't just drop everything on a whim and palm your responsibilities off onto someone else with little notice.", "It totally depends on the job and the boss. My husband did something similar for me for our anniversary one year. We got up, got ready for work and drove off; only we headed to the airport instead of our jobs. Awesome surprise, BUT he had talked to my job weeks earlier and got the time off approved for me.", "You're assuming she wouldn't have communicated that to the husband already. She also would've likely mentioned events in the post if their was a significant conflict.", "YOU NEED TO BE IN COURT AND HE CALLED YOU UPTIGHT? Straight to jail.", "This part. \nWe need more bosses like ours in the world.", "I took a vacation once - came back and because I wasn't at the staff meeting (Planned vacation mind you) they put on the second shift permanently because I wasn't there to give my opinion.     \n\n\nOMG!  (That company was run by evil tyrants)."]}
