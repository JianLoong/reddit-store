My husband has a family history of cancer, diabetes, heart issues, high blood pressure, etc. and it was always such a chore to get him to eat right and go to doctor appointments. It was like I had another child to look after. \n\nI had to set up the appointments, do follow-ups to make sure he went, and sometimes even attend his doctor visits with him. It got to the point where the doctor and I would just talk to each other while he sat in the corner because we both knew he either wasn't going to remember or just ask me. Unfortunately, I knew what he was like with medical appointments and loving junk food going in because his mom and sister gave me the heads up and I was too young and in love with him to really think about what that meant, but what I absolutely loathed was being made to be the bad guy. \n\nJohn would whine and complain to me and about me calling me a \"nag\" or a \"controlling b---\" for always getting in his a-- about his health. Then 2020 rolled around and it really blew up. One week in and John got tired of following the FDA guidelines and I had to put my foot down and give him an ultimatum because one of our children had a compromised immune system. He actually chose to live outside of the home for three months before finally agreeing to what I was requesting. \n\nFast forward to the end of 2021, we have a big blow out and I just threw my hands up in the air and said \"f it.\" Make your own doctor appointments, manage your own food and drink in-take, etc., and I just felt a weight lifted. John was really happy when I stopped bugging him about what he was eating and asking him if he did his 5 mile walk for the week. \n\nI still got on the kids about their fruits, vegetables, and drinking water (although they weren't as bad as my husband) and I stop giving a crap about what John did. Then recently I got a call while at work and found out that my husband was in the ER, I don't want to give all the details but basically due to his poor health management he's losing a foot, one of his kidneys isn't doing so great, and he might have cancer. John is understandably upset but he, and his friends that got on me for being a nag, are throwing shots and are blaming me. And it's really ticking me off. I called everyone out in a group text but now people are saying that I'm victim blaming so I have to ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1703128578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ncz6g/aita_for_not_taking_responsibility_for_my/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel frustrated for you, stuck in this.", "What an awful situation to be in.\n\nI'm caretaker to a husband who did everything right,  and it's hard.\nTo know he did it to himself, fought you, and now will need full time care is infuriating. \nTerrible situation.  I hate it for you.", "NTA- even if what you were doing was considered victim blaming it would be one of the few cases where the victim %100 should be blamed.  It\u2019s his body, his health and his responsibility, the only thing he is a victim of is his own lack of self preservation and that is no one\u2019s fault but his own", "We are all individually responsible for our own health (dependents excluded). \n\nYour husband has no reason to be mad at you. You were supposed to get a partner when you married him, not a toddler. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You aren't his mom, he had it coming. It's exhausting caring for others.

People need to take control of their own health, he is not a child!", "NTA. His poor health is not your fault and it's wrong for he and his friends to blame you. However, his health is not his fault either, and it sounds like you are blaming him. You have the right to be emotional, but you do also sound like kind of a nag. You demanded a 5 mile walk every week? You monitored his food and drink intake? That's nuts. He's only 48! A junk food diet and lack of exercise does not cause an otherwise healthy 48 year old to develop cancer. Either way though, you should have divorced him the first time he called you a B, and divorced him again when he put your immunocompromised child at risk.", "Obviously John is someone who doesn't take care of himself and doesn't appreciate the work you did do to help assist him be healthier. He's a real AH for being so stubborn he'd jeopardize his own child / move out versus just do the thing (I assume this is limiting outside the home contact and/or wearing a mask).\n\nBut I have to say you are not blameless. YOU married this guy and stayed married. YOU tried to constantly change him and YOU treated him like a child versus just accept that he is who he is. YOU nagged him and refused to just let him be an adult that makes his own (poor) choices. YOU had children with this man, and his poor example YOU absolutely knew about has now impacted your kids who seemingly share some of his habits.\n\nJohn's friends obviously are a big energy drain too. I'm not sure why you even engage with them or care what they think, since it sounds like both you and John barely respect each other. Never speaking to his friends again sounds like it would be no great loss.\n\nESH.", "You are at fault for enabling this for so long, but NTA for putting your foot down and letting him burn his own health & life into ashes. This could have been a wake up call for him, but sounds like he\u2019s using it to whine and blame and not be accountable for his own actions. Please divorce his ass because at this rate you\u2019re about to become the full-time caretaker of a disabled man who would not do the same if the tables were turned.", "I just don't understand why you spent so many years attempting to micromanage his health when he so emphatically told you he didn't want that kind of relationship from you. This wasn't him asking you to be his mother, this was you insisting on being his mother over his extremely extremely strong objections. \n\nThe last two years of the marriage, after you decided to stop micromanaging his health, seem like they were pretty good ones relatively (\"I just felt a weight lifted\" \"John was really happy\"). Now imagine how you'd feel if the whole 22 years of marriage had been that happy.", "I mean kind of YTA and NTA. YTA at the start - he's an adult and while he's making poor decisions you shouldn't have babied him or felt the need to (I'm saying this from experience because I did this with people I cared about and it didn't work out). All that does is make someone unable to make decisions for themselves. But NTA now - it's not your fault that your husband did this to himself.", "NTA. In order to victim blame, one needs a victim, not one who complains about a completely predictable sequence of events.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is an adult. He can make decisions for himself.", "When faced with an impenetrable barrier, you don\u2019t go through it but around it. What she should have done is buy as much term life insurance as possible, buy a cheap prepaid funeral, and peruse dating sites in front of him. When he protests, she tells him that since he\u2019s putting himself in an early grave, she\u2019s making sure she\u2019s well taken care of, in more ways than one. If the idea of his rich widow banging a dude half her age in a hotel suite his life insurance paid for doesn\u2019t motivate him to live longer, nothing will.", "NTA. It is unfortunate that in this country, mothers and wives are expected to take on the burden of managing the health of the men and boys in our lives. You probably should have dropped the rope a long time ago because this should never have been your responsibility to manage. You made the choice to spend your life with him, but he put the responsibility for his health on you, which is not fair.\n\nAsk him if he really is this selfish and stupid. You didn't put the junk food in his mouth. You probably didn't even buy it. You didn't ignore healthy eating or exercise, he did. He doesn't get to lay his bad decisions on you. Some people in this thread seem to be dumping on you for picking the guy, but 22+ years ago, he was probably mostly healthy- as most young adults are- and you tried your best while he actively fought against his own health. \n\nHe can still turn this around. Since the Iraq war, we have gotten really good at prosthesis. He can survive on one kidney, and many cancers are very treatable now. He gets to keep throwing temper tantrums and blaming you, and then die young. Or he gets to take on the work of turning his health around. My uncle got to stage 4 ckd, stating he would never do dialysis, so my cousin set up an appointment with a doctor who put him on a vegan, whole food diet. He and my aunt followed this diet, he lost 60 lbs, got off his BP meds and reversed his kidney disease to stage 3. It's your husband's choice if he wants to do the work that will prolong his life, you can't do it for him", "NTA. He treated you like you were his mom or something not his wife. He didn\u2019t appreciate your efforts and wanted you to stop. This is 100% his own fault and hopefully his friends can stop enabling him and this will be the wake-up call he needs before it\u2019s too late.", "Social norms do dictate women being the primary caretaker and influencer of their husband\u2019s health. That\u2019s true. But \u201cexpected to do this shit\u201d is a massive stretch considering OP was literally talking to the doctor solo because the husband wouldn\u2019t even bother to pull his head out of his ass to participate. That is way beyond normal or expected. \n\nHer husband is disgusting. She put up with 22 years of truly abysmal behavior, was called out of her name for trying to keep him alive a little longer. It absolutely was a terrible decision to stay with this man, common or not.", "So totally true!", "OR, write a chat response that says something like \"would you people PLEASE make up your minds? Either I'm a nag and a b...ch for getting on John about healthy habits all these years or it is my fault that he is now in the ER because I didn't keep watch 24x7. But it cannot be both\". \n\nCall out their illogical insanity...", "I would send that text! Also shouldn\u2019t they be supporting him & you during this difficult time instead of stabbing you in the back?!?!?!?", "Exactly this.", "Well said !!", "Also, it's crazy for someone's health to go down this much in two years. This guy was not far from these problems anyways. You can't give someone cancer.", "Yes.\n\nIf you can, ditch this butthead. He's selfish beyond belief, and *cruel*.\n\nYou have so much more life to live, and you can live it in so much more freedom.", "\nFrom the sounds of it his health is absolutely his fault. Loss of foot and kidney issues sound like untreated diabetes and hypertension, both things that most certainly can be caused by lack of exercise and bad diet. \n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he\u2019s at higher risk for colon cancer because of his family history and he skipped the yearly colonoscopy (his fault again). And if it\u2019s colon cancer, then certain dietary choices absolutely increase the risk.", "Yeah same opinion - you can't try to control a person, that ruins a marriage. But also the guy is an overgrown child.", "That part. I\u2019m not begging you to follow precautions for longer than a week in order to keep our immunocompromised child alive.

What the fuck.", "I mean, John would probably already be dead, so...", "I can see diabetes becoming a problem in that span but that\u2019s still his fault. My brother got diabetes and he went from normal to really high blood sugar in only a few months. Thankfully he took charge himself like a grownup and turned things around.", "Put that way it really does feel like victim blaming. My dad just lost his thumb from probably something similar, infection exacerbated by diabetes. It was so stupid: he cut his thumbnail too close to the quick, of course he didn't go to the hospital over such a minor cut, and after just a couple of days it was already to the point they had to amputate. It really sucks (he was a guitarist) and of course I wish he had gone to the hospital immediately just in case. But I certainly don't blame him for it!", "Yup. If you don't like someone's habits and values... don't marry them.", "lol yep, but I kinda feel like they'd both be okay with that. He'd have died happy and she would have had many fond memories of her wonderful husband who was taken from her too soon.", "One hundred percent, accept a person and marry them or don't marry them.", "Haha, fair point!"]}
