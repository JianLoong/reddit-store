My husband has a family history of cancer, diabetes, heart issues, high blood pressure, etc. and it was always such a chore to get him to eat right and go to doctor appointments. It was like I had another child to look after. \n\nI had to set up the appointments, do follow-ups to make sure he went, and sometimes even attend his doctor visits with him. It got to the point where the doctor and I would just talk to each other while he sat in the corner because we both knew he either wasn't going to remember or just ask me. Unfortunately, I knew what he was like with medical appointments and loving junk food going in because his mom and sister gave me the heads up and I was too young and in love with him to really think about what that meant, but what I absolutely loathed was being made to be the bad guy. \n\nJohn would whine and complain to me and about me calling me a \"nag\" or a \"controlling b---\" for always getting in his a-- about his health. Then 2020 rolled around and it really blew up. One week in and John got tired of following the FDA guidelines and I had to put my foot down and give him an ultimatum because one of our children had a compromised immune system. He actually chose to live outside of the home for three months before finally agreeing to what I was requesting. \n\nFast forward to the end of 2021, we have a big blow out and I just threw my hands up in the air and said \"f it.\" Make your own doctor appointments, manage your own food and drink in-take, etc., and I just felt a weight lifted. John was really happy when I stopped bugging him about what he was eating and asking him if he did his 5 mile walk for the week. \n\nI still got on the kids about their fruits, vegetables, and drinking water (although they weren't as bad as my husband) and I stop giving a crap about what John did. Then recently I got a call while at work and found out that my husband was in the ER, I don't want to give all the details but basically due to his poor health management he's losing a foot, one of his kidneys isn't doing so great, and he might have cancer. John is understandably upset but he, and his friends that got on me for being a nag, are throwing shots and are blaming me. And it's really ticking me off.

I hate it for you.", "NTA- even if what you were doing was considered victim blaming it would be one of the few cases where the victim %100 should be blamed.

However, his health is not his fault either, and it sounds like you are blaming him. You have the right to be emotional, but you do also sound like kind of a nag. You demanded a 5 mile walk every week? You monitored his food and drink intake? That's nuts. He's only 48!

Either way though, you should have divorced him the first time he called you a B, and divorced him again when he put your immunocompromised child at risk.", "Obviously John is someone who doesn't take care of himself and doesn't appreciate the work you did do to help assist him be healthier. He's a real AH for being so stubborn he'd jeopardize his own child / move out versus just do the thing (I assume this is limiting outside the home contact and/or wearing a mask).\n\nBut I have to say you are not blameless. YOU married this guy and stayed married. YOU tried to constantly change him and YOU treated him like a child versus just accept that he is who he is. YOU nagged him and refused to just let him be an adult that makes his own (poor) choices. YOU had children with this man, and his poor example YOU absolutely knew about has now impacted your kids who seemingly share some of his habits.\n\nJohn's friends obviously are a big energy drain too. I'm not sure why you even engage with them or care what they think, since it sounds like both you and John barely respect each other. Never speaking to his friends again sounds like it would be no great loss.\n\nESH.", "You are at fault for enabling this for so long, but NTA for putting your foot down and letting him burn his own health & life into ashes. This could have been a wake up call for him, but sounds like he\u2019s using it to whine and blame and not be accountable for his own actions. Please divorce his ass because at this rate you\u2019re about to become the full-time caretaker of a disabled man who would not do the same if the tables were turned.", "I just don't understand why you spent so many years attempting to micromanage his health when he so emphatically told you he didn't want that kind of relationship from you. This wasn't him asking you to be his mother, this was you insisting on being his mother over his extremely extremely strong objections. \n\nThe last two years of the marriage, after you decided to stop micromanaging his health, seem like they were pretty good ones relatively (\"I just felt a weight lifted\" \"John was really happy\"). Now imagine how you'd feel if the whole 22 years of marriage had been that happy.", "I mean kind of YTA and NTA. YTA at the start - he's an adult and while he's making poor decisions you shouldn't have babied him or felt the need to (I'm saying this from experience because I did this with people I cared about and it didn't work out). All that does is make someone unable to make decisions for themselves. But NTA now - it's not your fault that your husband did this to himself.", "NTA.

He can make decisions for himself.", "When faced with an impenetrable barrier, you don\u2019t go through it but around it.

When he protests, she tells him that since he\u2019s putting himself in an early grave, she\u2019s making sure she\u2019s well taken care of, in more ways than one. If the idea of his rich widow banging a dude half her age in a hotel suite his life insurance paid for doesn\u2019t motivate him to live longer, nothing will.", "NTA. It is unfortunate that in this country, mothers and wives are expected to take on the burden of managing the health of the men and boys in our lives. You probably should have dropped the rope a long time ago because this should never have been your responsibility to manage. You made the choice to spend your life with him, but he put the responsibility for his health on you, which is not fair.\n\nAsk him if he really is this selfish and stupid. You didn't put the junk food in his mouth. You probably didn't even buy it. You didn't ignore healthy eating or exercise, he did. He doesn't get to lay his bad decisions on you. Some people in this thread seem to be dumping on you for picking the guy, but 22+ years ago, he was probably mostly healthy- as most young adults are- and you tried your best while he actively fought against his own health. \n\nHe can still turn this around. Since the Iraq war, we have gotten really good at prosthesis. He can survive on one kidney, and many cancers are very treatable now. He gets to keep throwing temper tantrums and blaming you, and then die young. Or he gets to take on the work of turning his health around. My uncle got to stage 4 ckd, stating he would never do dialysis, so my cousin set up an appointment with a doctor who put him on a vegan, whole food diet. He and my aunt followed this diet, he lost 60 lbs, got off his BP meds and reversed his kidney disease to stage 3. It's your husband's choice if he wants to do the work that will prolong his life, you can't do it for him", "NTA. He treated you like you were his mom or something not his wife. He didn\u2019t appreciate your efforts and wanted you to stop. This is 100% his own fault and hopefully his friends can stop enabling him and this will be the wake-up call he needs before it\u2019s too late.", "Social norms do dictate women being the primary caretaker and influencer of their husband\u2019s health. That\u2019s true. But \u201cexpected to do this shit\u201d is a massive stretch considering OP was literally talking to the doctor solo because the husband wouldn\u2019t even bother to pull his head out of his ass to participate. That is way beyond normal or expected. \n\nHer husband is disgusting. She put up with 22 years of truly abysmal behavior, was called out of her name for trying to keep him alive a little longer. It absolutely was a terrible decision to stay with this man, common or not.", "So totally true!", "OR, write a chat response that says something like \"would you people PLEASE make up your minds?

This guy was not far from these problems anyways. You can't give someone cancer.", "Yes.\n\nIf you can, ditch this butthead. He's selfish beyond belief, and *cruel*.\n\nYou have so much more life to live, and you can live it in so much more freedom.", "\nFrom the sounds of it his health is absolutely his fault. Loss of foot and kidney issues sound like untreated diabetes and hypertension, both things that most certainly can be caused by lack of exercise and bad diet. \n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he\u2019s at higher risk for colon cancer because of his family history and he skipped the yearly colonoscopy (his fault again).

What the fuck.", "I mean, John would probably already be dead, so...", "I can see diabetes becoming a problem in that span but that\u2019s still his fault. My brother got diabetes and he went from normal to really high blood sugar in only a few months. Thankfully he took charge himself like a grownup and turned things around.", "Put that way it really does feel like victim blaming. My dad just lost his thumb from probably something similar, infection exacerbated by diabetes. It was so stupid: he cut his thumbnail too close to the quick, of course he didn't go to the hospital over such a minor cut, and after just a couple of days it was already to the point they had to amputate. It really sucks (he was a guitarist) and of course I wish he had gone to the hospital immediately just in case. But I certainly don't blame him for it!", "Yup. If you don't like someone's habits and values... don't marry them.", "lol yep, but I kinda feel like they'd both be okay with that. He'd have died happy and she would have had many fond memories of her wonderful husband who was taken from her too soon.", "One hundred percent, accept a person and marry them or don't marry them.", "Haha, fair point!", "NTA\n\n> people are saying that I'm victim blaming \n\nJohn\u2019s health was his responsibility, as was his decision to demand you leave him alone about it.\n\nPointing out this is the consequences of his own choices isn\u2019t victim blaming, because there is no victim or perpetrator.\n\nJust him and himself and his health.\n\nIt\u2019s also utterly shitty that was only lobbed after you defended yourself for being blamed for his decisions.", "NTA - Also leave him, please. That kind of person is toxic and unable to be self sufficient. You've got nothing but bad days ahead as he'll progressively get worse. Best to emotionally detach yourself now so that when he inevitably dies, you're not as emotionally involved.", "NTA. It was interfering with your relationship when you were in charge of John's health.  He said you were a nag and a bitch, qualities generally not found desirable in a mate, and not conducive to a good marital relationship.  \nSo you took his words to heart and backed off, admitting he is an adult and can be responsible for his own health decisions.  \nThat's all you have to say in defense of your actions.", "NTA but why are you still with him. He is awful, I don't care he is ill. And anyone blaming you should be told to care for him now.", "\"Oh, look! It's the consequences of my actions! This is definitely someone elses fault!\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. He/they wanted you to stop nagging him. Consequences. He needs to start Adulting.", "NTA It should never have been your responsibility in the first place.

He is the only one responsible for his health. He is an adult and made his own decisions that lead to current situation. Also, it sucks but the best for him and you will be to accept current situation and focus on what can be done now instead of blaming. You also need to know that if you choose to take care of his health now you need to make sure that major decisions is made by him, not you even if you disagree with them and think they are stupid. It\u2019s his life and should always be his choice. This is the only way you will not be blamed and will not feel guilty if something will go incredibly wrong.

Just write that off, the way you wrote off being responsible for saving John from John.\n\nIf it helps you, these are some of the message you can remind yourself of/ convey to others as needed:\n\n1. What John's/his friends are saying is: without all your time and effort (which he/they called nagging) for the past 22 years, John would not have done the things he needs to do to protect his health.\n2. John is responsible for John. He puts all his effort into not taking responsibility for himself. If they think John is owed someone to carry the weight of being responsible for him while he complains, insults, and actively sabotages his health - well then, they are welcome to fill the role.\n3. If they can excuse John for not being able to take responsibility for taking care of himself (and could excuse him for that for the past 22 years), then they can excuse you for no long (after 22 years) being able to be responsible for his unwilling, ungrateful arse.\n4. You spent 22 years doing everything in your power to give him a chance to live his best life. You've realized that you can't care more about giving him his best chance to live life well than he does. So now he's going to live the best life he is willing to give himself.\n\nAs hard as all this is for you, I'm sure it's crazy hard for your kids, too. You may want to consider some family therapy for them and you - to help them process your decisions, John's decisions, and the challenges that are likely to follow. I don't know if you ready to go this far, but you may want to consider divorcing John or talking to a lawyer about separating your finances. His health and life choices might otherwise completely drain your family's financial resources. I'm sorry for all that your family is going through.", "NTA He is a grown child. He did it. He owns it.

He's been like this since before they were married. \n\nAt present, back in October her husband fell off of a ladder and shattered his femur. When he was being moved to a rehabilitation facility, he outright refused because he wanted her to take care of him. She told him that she can't lift him or provide physical therapy.

One obstical was the expectation on the women to be her mans carer.\n\nOne example was a women in an abusive relationship who was pregnant and shared concerns with her doctor that her husband was abusive. In one meeting she told her doctor that her husband had a drinking problem and would drive drunk. The doctor got angry and told her she couldn\u2019t *let him* drive drunk and to  take the car keys from him if necessary. So this medical professional ordered a pregnant and abused women to  regularly get into a physical altercations with her drunk abuser! Because it was obviously her responsibilty to care and manage him, even if it put her and her baby at risk.\n\nLikewise, the people upset at OP believe that it is her responsibility to care and manage her husband, regardless of how he treat her for it. To them, she is his caretaker before being her own person.

I was on him about going to the doctor. He wouldnt. He would say \"im Fine\" then it would happen all over again. A few months later and 60lbs thinner, i woke up to him on the couch looking bad..really bad.

As some other commenters have pointed out, this was a pretty sudden and dramatic change in just two years. What could he have possibly done to himself in the short two years that she stopped nagging him that made him go from perfectly healthy (she would have told us if he had any actual health problems other than family history) to suddenly losing a foot? That's a big escalation. Men generally don't even start getting regular physicals until their mid 40s, and that's assuming health insurance and disposable income for the deductible. I think it's a reach to assume this is his fault. Sometimes bad things in life just happen."]}
