Put that in a pipe and smoke it, Mom.", "NTA\nWow. Um. No, your mom thinking that you should dress differently around your dad is not normal. Your brother should probably stay the hell away from this one, tbh.", "NTA. 1) you\u2019re an adult, dress in what is comfortable for you. 2) if it is \u201cinappropriate\u201d to dress that way around your *father*, that\u2019s a major red flag on his part. He should not have any reaction to the way that you dress that would lead somebody to say that it is inappropriate. \n\nDoes your father actually feel uncomfortable when you dress that way, or is your mother assuming that he feels uncomfortable? The former would be a major problem. The latter would be projection on your mother\u2019s part, indicative of something lying beneath the surface that she should probably communicate with her husband (or a professional\u2014therapy is a good solution to nearly everything, including things that aren\u2019t major problems)", "If your father is looking at your body like that,that's all kinds of creepy and sounds like you shouldn't be in that house for your safety and the fact that your brother and mom think that's OK is an even bigger red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA- Inappropriate when your father is around?! I don't know what to even say.", "If your father is checking out your private parts, that's a him problem and disgusting, to boot. Your parents are both gross.\nNTA.", "NTA- Of course your brother agrees with her, in this paradigm men are always right and catered to constantly. Who would ever want to let go of that? You are challenging a status quo that favors him, of course he is going to push back. That said get a back-up plan for housing, maybe a summer job and some roommates. You don't need the body police in your life.", "NTA - Your mom sounds jealous of you. She won\u2019t let you wear shorts at home but she can? Okay. Either your dad\u2019s a creep for sexualizing you, your mom\u2019s a creep for sexualizing you and thinking her husband will do the same, or they\u2019re both creeps.\n\nI\u2019d be petty and ask for a list of her \u201capproved\u201d clothes and post them around the house and dresscode her whenever she\u2019s breaking them. What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander; a dresscode isn\u2019t just for one person, it\u2019s for everyone present.\n\nSeriously though, she has no right to sexualize you. You\u2019re wearing pants. Absolutely ridiculous of her to find something \u201cwrong\u201d with that.", "NTA, also, WTF? Just what kind of a man does she think your father is to look at your body parts and think THAT?", "NTA too bad she can\u2019t take what she dishes out", "NTA", "Totally NTA, but I want to share with you my own personal experience with something similar.   \nMy parents were very religious growing up and my mother said almost word for word what yours did, when I was as young as 13. She also used the phrase, \"To not make your father or brother stumble\" over a spaghetti strap shirt. Just to give you a little bit of backstory.   \n I know it's freaking crazy and it never really sat well with me as a kid. I have done a fair amount of therapy as an adult, trust that.   \nNow that I'm older and healed up, I can recognize that my mother said (and sometimes still says) stupid things out of a place of complete ignorance. She was raised that way, and never really knew anything outside of her christian conservative bubble of a life. It was never malicious or intentionally abusive towards me.   \nWhile it stings when your parent says stupid stuff, and it's tempting to snap back, it's always been counterproductive for getting my point across in my experience. All they hear is the snap, they don't hear the logic of it. It just comes across as disrespect, and that's not something that's going to make living under their roof any easier, especially if you are financial dependent on them.   \nWhat has made a difference, for both of us, is if I calmly and respectfully try to educate her on why these comments are inappropriate. That's the real cure for ignorance, education. My mom has come a long way because I've basically been reparenting my parents for the past ten years when stuff comes up like this. I don't blame you at all for clapping back at your mom, but maybe when things calm down, try to talk to her and explain that you trust that your father isn't lusting over your body, and that if he is, there are bigger problems at hand than how tight your pants are. Explain that you feel you have the right to be comfortable in your home and not suffer in heat because of some illogical fear that men cannot control their sexual urges. Hopefully she comes around and starts to understand that her current belief system is pretty fucked.   \nI'm really sorry you are going through that, and your mom is a totally the asshole in this situation, but based on what you said about her in your first paragraph, I'm hoping that this advice helps you to help her and that you get to wear shorts without reprimand.    \nIf not, move out asap and get away from this crazy.", "Nah ask your mom why she thinks your family is looking at your body in a sexual way and if you need to take protective measures.", "NTA\n\nNo one should ever be made to feel like a sexual object around their *father*. Full stop.", "Nta the second she said \"when your father is around\". Nope. Gross. Grown ass man is fully capable of existing around females without making it weird. And if not, HE shouldn't be there", "NTA- Man, I'm having flashbacks of when I was nine and I was told I couldn't wear a nightgown in the living room anymore when my mom's boyfriend was home.\n\nF-that.\n\nYou have the right to feel comfortable in your own home. You you were dressed appropriately.  \nIf she has problems in the future, maybe you should just wear a paper sack or something.\n\nCensored. May show body lines.", "NTA wear shorts and the pants whenever you like. Then ask your dad why he told your Mom he was sexually interested in you. Oh, and get away from all these misogynistic weirdos.", "Your mom is abusive and apparently thinks your dad is worse (why on earth would he see you in a sexual way?!) You need to get away, you\u2019re an adult.", "NTA and frankly i'd turn it on her, but i'm petty like that. Call a family meeting and say that you're concerned about your father, because Mom says he's a pervert who's attracted to his own daughter and that we need to come together and get him therapy to fight his urges. watch how fast mom backtracks.", "In the middle of a conversation slut shaming you for your dad being a perv, she \"joked\" about you being unladylike? I feel like that is the least of her worries at this point.  \nNTA", "ESH\n\nAn eye-for-an-eye leaves everyone blind.
