I\u2019ve known her for about a year but we\u2019ve never been like super close or anything. The one thing we do have a strong connection about is our faith as we\u2019re both religious people. We\u2019ve talked extensively about our faith with each other and our views on certain world issues. \n\nI was just informed of her wedding a few days ago. I do know her fianc\u00e9 and have met him. Now the church where the ceremony is located is about 30 min drive with no traffic. So the drive isn\u2019t horrible. However, I was informed by her that it was \u2018open ceremony, closed reception\u2019. So I am not invited to the reception. I\u2019m not too familiar on wedding etiquette when it comes to inviting people so I looked it up and apparently it\u2019s something that\u2019s frowned upon to invite someone to the ceremony but not the reception. A lot of people were saying to only invite as many people to the ceremony as you would have at the reception. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it would be wrong of me to not attend her ceremony. I don\u2019t really want to drive 30 mins and do a maybe 20 min ceremony only to drive back 30 mins. Also I do feel a little hurt that I was invited to the ceremony but not the reception. I feel it\u2019s like a slap in the face like I\u2019m not good enough to attend the reception. If anything I\u2019ll probably send a wedding gift with congratulations.\n\nEdit: also to note I never received an invitation via mail. I received a text message from her explaining why she hasn\u2019t spoken to me recently and then she invited me to attend her ceremony \n\nEdit 2: I know that her reception will contain her family AND her and her finances family and friends. I actually knew a few months prior that she was planning a wedding but was not told when it would be. She told me when I asked about the date of the wedding that she was \u2018only telling her more close friends about the date\u2019.  I assumed the date would be later in 2024. Also we are of the same faith and I can guarantee you guys that in our denomination only inviting family to reception is NOT common. Most people if not all invite family and friends.

It\u2019s a bit unusual to me though - you started this post by saying you aren\u2019t super close and haven\u2019t known each other very long, so I\u2019m surprised that you see it as a slap in the face.\n\nRealistically, weddings are super expensive. By cutting down on people at the reception, it\u2019s probably saving them a lot of money which may be important to them. And just because the internet says it\u2019s a bad thing to not invite everyone to the ceremony, it doesn\u2019t consider whatever your friend\u2019s context is. Further, I\u2019d argue the reception is probably more aligned with your friendship with her, presuming that her faith will be prominent in the ceremony. She wanted to share part of her wedding with you, and I think that\u2019s pretty special.\n\nSo I guess NTA for not wanting to go, but soft YTA for conclusion jumping and inconsistency?", "Well her plan is working.  She invited you for a gift.  \n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nShe wants you to feel obligated to give her a gift and you do.   Don\u2019t do it. \n\nNTA", "NAH. I don't know what part of the world you are from but I've definitely heard of people having a larger ceremony and smaller reception (I've even been to a few ceremonies where I wasn't invited to the reception). It can be a way of including people who are important to you but keeping the, often exorbitant, cost of a wedding down. Especially since you primarily connect with this person through religion, it doesn't surprise me you are invited to that part of the event. Having said that you are NTA for not going just like they are NTA for not inviting you to the whole shebang.", "NTA\n\nYou were an AFTERTHOUGHT. I wouldn't go because I was not invited to the reception & she only told me about it a few weeks in advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If anything I\u2019ll probably send a wedding gift with congratulations.\n\nIf I got her a gift: my gift would have been an AFTERTHOUGHT too. - A 50% + off candle.", "NAH. When my husband and I got married we didn't have a lot of money. We could only afford a small reception. Therefore we decided to invite all our friends and relatives to the ceremony but only close family to the reception. That's actually not uncommon where I live. However no one is obliged to attend a wedding no matter the reason. Just maybe don't jump to conclusions. It's actually common in a lot of congregations as well to invite all members to the ceremony but only close family to the reception", "NTA. That\u2019s way too late to invite somebody. Either this was super disorganized or you were on the D list and somebody else canceled which is why they invited you last minute. In which case they don\u2019t really care that much if you come.", "NTA, do something fun that night - don't send a card."]}
