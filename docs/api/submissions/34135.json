However, I was informed by her that it was \u2018open ceremony, closed reception\u2019. So I am not invited to the reception. I\u2019m not too familiar on wedding etiquette when it comes to inviting people so I looked it up and apparently it\u2019s something that\u2019s frowned upon to invite someone to the ceremony but not the reception. A lot of people were saying to only invite as many people to the ceremony as you would have at the reception. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it would be wrong of me to not attend her ceremony. I don\u2019t really want to drive 30 mins and do a maybe 20 min ceremony only to drive back 30 mins. Also I do feel a little hurt that I was invited to the ceremony but not the reception. I feel it\u2019s like a slap in the face like I\u2019m not good enough to attend the reception. If anything I\u2019ll probably send a wedding gift with congratulations.\n\nEdit: also to note I never received an invitation via mail. I received a text message from her explaining why she hasn\u2019t spoken to me recently and then she invited me to attend her ceremony \n\nEdit 2: I know that her reception will contain her family AND her and her finances family and friends. I actually knew a few months prior that she was planning a wedding but was not told when it would be. She told me when I asked about the date of the wedding that she was \u2018only telling her more close friends about the date\u2019.  I assumed the date would be later in 2024. Also we are of the same faith and I can guarantee you guys that in our denomination only inviting family to reception is NOT common. Most people if not all invite family and friends.

It\u2019s a bit unusual to me though - you started this post by saying you aren\u2019t super close and haven\u2019t known each other very long, so I\u2019m surprised that you see it as a slap in the face.\n\nRealistically, weddings are super expensive. By cutting down on people at the reception, it\u2019s probably saving them a lot of money which may be important to them. And just because the internet says it\u2019s a bad thing to not invite everyone to the ceremony, it doesn\u2019t consider whatever your friend\u2019s context is. Further, I\u2019d argue the reception is probably more aligned with your friendship with her, presuming that her faith will be prominent in the ceremony. She wanted to share part of her wedding with you, and I think that\u2019s pretty special.\n\nSo I guess NTA for not wanting to go, but soft YTA for conclusion jumping and inconsistency?", "Well her plan is working.  She invited you for a gift.  \n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nShe wants you to feel obligated to give her a gift and you do.   Don\u2019t do it. \n\nNTA", "NAH. I don't know what part of the world you are from but I've definitely heard of people having a larger ceremony and smaller reception (I've even been to a few ceremonies where I wasn't invited to the reception). It can be a way of including people who are important to you but keeping the, often exorbitant, cost of a wedding down. Especially since you primarily connect with this person through religion, it doesn't surprise me you are invited to that part of the event. Having said that you are NTA for not going just like they are NTA for not inviting you to the whole shebang.", "NTA\n\nYou were an AFTERTHOUGHT. I wouldn't go because I was not invited to the reception & she only told me about it a few weeks in advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If anything I\u2019ll probably send a wedding gift with congratulations.\n\nIf I got her a gift: my gift would have been an AFTERTHOUGHT too. - A 50% + off candle.", "NAH. When my husband and I got married we didn't have a lot of money. We could only afford a small reception. Therefore we decided to invite all our friends and relatives to the ceremony but only close family to the reception. That's actually not uncommon where I live. However no one is obliged to attend a wedding no matter the reason. Just maybe don't jump to conclusions. It's actually common in a lot of congregations as well to invite all members to the ceremony but only close family to the reception", "NTA. That\u2019s way too late to invite somebody. Either this was super disorganized or you were on the D list and somebody else canceled which is why they invited you last minute. In which case they don\u2019t really care that much if you come.", "NTA, do something fun that night - don't send a card.", "Do not attend. You were not officially invited. Unless you received a formal invitation, you were not invited. She does not consider you a friend. There is absolutely nothing wrong and nothing petty about choosing not to attend this wedding. The very fact that she told you that she is only telling CLOSE friends the date means that she does not consider you a friend at all.\n\nTHis is a gift grab. That is all it is. She is inviting you with the expectation that you will show up with a gift for her and then leave. She will ghost you again after the wedding as she has leading up to the wedding.\n\nThis friendship is one sided. You have been a friend to her, she has not been a friend to you. Please have the dignity to ignore this gift grab.\n\nNTA.", "As an invitee to the ceremony, you are expected to give a fairly generous gift...\n\nAs a guest at the reception, well... that costs your friend money!\n\nBy inviting you to the ceremony, but not the reception, your friend gets a present from  you, but doesn't have to pay for you to be at the reception! Good solution for a greedy bride/groom. NTA", "YWNBTA if you decided not to attend the wedding reception if you had received a formal invitation. That would have still been an invitation, not an obligation. All that\u2019s required is a timely RSVP declining the invitation.   \n\n\nA text message directing you to a religious ceremony that is open to the public is not an invitation that requires a gift or any guilt about declining such an invitation. In my area/in my religion, the ONLY times I\u2019ve heard an invitation to the church only being acceptable is when it\u2019s done by teachers with their young students when many of the children are just so excited to see the bride and groom dressed up.", "NTA.\n\nI'm currently planning a wedding for May for myself, and I can't even fathom inviting someone to the ceremony but not the reception. If the reception area can only hold x amount of people, that's how many you should invite to the ceremony, period.", "NTA.  Don't go if you don't want to.  Also, don't send a wedding gift if you were not invited to a shower \\*and\\* the reception.  Etiquette is that you don't invite someone to the shower if you don't invite them to the wedding and reception, and you don't expect a gift from *anyone* you're not inviting to both the wedding and reception (you can invite someone to the wedding and reception without inviting them to the shower, however).  It's rude to ask for a gift from someone you aren't feeding.  It doesn't matter what faith you are.  You are not required to attend just because she texted you and you are not required to send anything.  Just send her a congratulatory message back via text and tell her that you won't be attending.  No need to tell her why.  If she asks, tell her you have something else in mind for that date - just don't tell her that it's sitting at home, relaxing.", "Meh, I went to a wedding and it was an open ceremony but closed reception. They did do some canap\u00e9s after the ceremony and I thought it was really lovely to be part of this moment and I wanted to go to show my support. NAH you either want to go or you don\u2019t.", "NAH - you weren't really invited to the wedding. Some churches will do an announcement ahead of time so anyone in the church can go to the ceremony if they like. Think of it more of your friend extending this information to you instead of being given an invitation.  It can be a little tricky to let people know who might be interested without making it sound like an invitation to the ceremony after. There were a few ceremonies I would have gone to, but found out after the fact.\n\nNo need to inform her if you aren't going to go. I also don't see this as a gift grab, most people who attend due to an open ceremony only don't send a gift. Give her a card if you like.", "NTA. Don't go. You're not close and she isn't inviting you to the reception. It's a gift grab.", "\"Dear Bride,\n\nI'm so sorry I can't attend.  I only wish I'd known sooner, but now I have something else I'm doing that day.\n\nBest, OP\"\n\nOf course you have something else you're doing that day.  This would include brushing your teeth and eating three meals.  It would not include being an afterthought at the wedding of a person you're not close to but who reaaaaaaaaallllly wants more presents.\n\nIf you do send a gift (which, to my mind, you're under no obligation to do), make it a religious paperback book.  This would both be very considerate and special in terms of the one area where you're close to her, but not expensive, and thereby not giving Bride the very bad message that you can shake people down for big ticket gifts.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDon't go if you don't want to. The fact you did not even recieve an invite says a lot. \n\nAn hour commute, plus all the time and energy to get ready, is not worth 20 mins of pomp. \n\nSend her best wishes, and move on.", "NTA, don't attend, you're not considered her friend. You don't have an invitation and were told last minute. They don't deserve the trouble or the gift. But I wouldn't inform them about not going, just don't show up. Only if she asks, tell her you won't be available that day after all. You don't have to give details.", "NTA.  So it sounds like you didn\u2019t even know the date until very recently\u2026 By your phrasing in the edit \u2018 I assumed it would be later in 2024\u2019 and her saying \u201conly close friends know the date \u201c.  You only got somewhat invited over a text message also\u2026 Sounds like unfortunately it possibly only came up because it was somehow pressed or as someone else mentioned she wanted a gift which you already do feel obligated to give. I would just not attend and I would not give a gift", "NAH. \n\nI was invited to a friend\u2019s ceremony and not reception and I took no offence. By the time wedding came around, we just weren\u2019t that close anymore. I felt her including my in the ceremony was a nice acknowledgment of the fact we were once close, and I was happy to support her by showing up in that spirit. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t bring a gift - I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary if they\u2019re not spending money on your attendance at the reception. \n\nYou\u2019re obviously not obligated to attend, and maybe you\u2019re feeling hurt because you viewed your relationship as closer than she does. But the fact alone of inviting friends or acquaintances who are not as close to only the ceremony is not necessarily inappropriate.", "Yup, it\u2019s no cost to her inviting OP to the ceremony but not the reception and with norms get a wedding gift without spending a single dim.", "Arn't gifts given at the recpetion normaly anyway?", "My mom told me once she and my dad got married kind of early in the morning (one of the few times my dad was ever voluntarily in a Catholic church), they came back to my maternal grandmother's house for breakfast and then went to work! I thought this was a bit strange, especially when I looked up their wedding date (gotta love Google Calendar) and found out they were married on a Sunday. On the other hand, they were both working for a local newspaper at the time...(I don't know if they ever had any kind of reception and neither one of them is here to ask anymore.)", "It\u2019s still a slap in the face that she is inviting OP that late without even an invite or a call but just on txt", "As a Catholic it's shocking that they were married on a Sunday.", "my first thought was i wonder if they\u2019re doing like an intimate family dinner as a reception? but either way an invitation is an invitation, OP can politely decline and send a card!", "Well, there's another thing I don't know. My grandmother went to Mass every weekend with my great-uncle (her brother-in-law), but I don't know if my mom was baptized or not--I never saw her go to church for anything but weddings or funerals. Same with my dad. And when she told me this, I was only seven or eight, so I'm assuming some details were left out.", "If you have paperwork of hers there may be a baptism certificate. If you know where they lived when she was born you can contact the church to see if you can get a copy of her certificate; that's a way to learn if it exists. \n\nNot going to church isn't an indication of not being baptized. \n\nBaptism normally happens not long after birth. Mine was 10 days later, on a Sunday."]}
