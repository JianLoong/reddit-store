She uses people to get what she wants whether it\u2019s money, attention, popularity etc. I cut her off back in March of 2023 after we got into a huge fight over her relapsing on alcohol again and showing up to my house sh*t face drunk.

To make a long story shorter my mom has always been incredibly emotional and verbally abusive towards me my entire life. My younger brother was her perfect kid and I was just a massive failure no matter how hard I tried or what I achieved it was never good enough. Fast forward to now. My brother let me know that my mom had started dating someone new. Cool whatever right? The new dude has the same exact name as my father who my mother was married to for 17 years. Get this new bf also has a daughter who is apparently between the ages of 15-17 according to my brother he isn\u2019t sure but her name is the exact same name as mine. When I was growing up my mother would always talk about how she would replace me if she could. I just didn\u2019t think she would actually go to the lengths to find someone who has the same name as my father who also has a daughter with MY name. Some may say this is pure coincidence.

If he doesn't listen, that is on him at that point.

Then it's up to him to believe or not.", "NTA. Please tell him. He deserves to be warned in advance about what kind of person he's marrying. But... Don't be surprised if he doesn't act on it. Unfortunately, a lot of people, even when warned about all of the signs, end up making huge mistakes when it comes to romance.", "He totally needs to know he is stepping into a trap. I would also get brother to go along with it because she probably wants a do over of her life and if she won't treat step daughter like shit, she will start treating brother like shit. YWNBTA.", "YWNBTA Obviously if he doesn't listen that's not your problem, but they're only two months into a relationship that could have lasting impacts on his daughter if she tries to make her your \"perfect replacement\". Narcissists need to be called out sometimes. Now is one of those times.", "Not necessarily TA, but if you cut her off, for your own sake, you need to *cut her off.* Meaning you don\u2019t interfere with her life at all. If that dude is going to marry a woman after two months, that\u2019s on him. If he\u2019s going to be that dumb, that\u2019s on him. I feel for the teen involved, but at a certain point you are going to look bad for \u201cwarning him\u201d and it\u2019s not goin to do anyone any good. \n\nFor your own sanity, you need to let her go. Tell everyone to stop telling you about her, and truly honestly *let her go.* \n\nI had to cut my mom off a few years ago, and I finally had to put my foot down with my brother telling me everything about her. I suggest you do the same, staying involved in her drama will only hurt you. It\u2019s likely her partner won\u2019t listen. She\u2019s probably told him all about you, and how awful you are, so if he\u2019s with her, he\u2019s likely not going to believe you. And honestly, you probably don\u2019t have to worry about the teen. I\u2019m really sorry to be saying this, but it seems like she\u2019ll treat her stepdaughter better than she ever treated you. \n\nNTA, but coming from someone who has been in a similar situation, it\u2019s just not worth it. Let it go, and let this man make his own choices. The daughter will most likely be fine. She\u2019ll be an adult in a few years anyways, it won\u2019t be like how it was with you. I understand the impulse, but it\u2019s just not a good idea when you really think about it. I think the people telling you to do it have no idea how this could or likely will play out. Take it from someone who\u2019s been there, just let it go.", "YWNBTA for warning her new boyfriend. \n\nYour mother is abusive, toxic and sounds very narcissistic, frankly. I think it would be best to warn her new boyfriend of the abuse you've gone through, her plans of essentially wanting to replace you, the abuse his daughter would very likely go through if they were to remain together, and the fact that she's making plans to marry him (I kinda have doubts he's even aware of this considering they've only been together for two months).\n\nI'm so sorry for everything you've been through and I hope you're proud of yourself cutting her off \u2764\ufe0f this internet stranger is certainly proud of you! Please stick to your boundaries and keep her cut off for your sake.  \n\nLastly, I hope you've considered therapy, as I'm sure it would be a great help \u2764\ufe0f", "Plot twist, her new boyfriend could be worse than her and you might end up saving her from him.", "NTA \n\nDoing the right thing is difficult and may backfire but it's better to try than to sit by knowing how your mom is. Either way he'll find out eventually", "NTA.\nAs someone with a mother who's been chasing d*ck their entire life & made empty promies my entire life, I'd do it if I got the chance as well. My mom has never been faithful in a single relationship she's ever been in, she drives the people she dates to drinking & then wonders why they keep drinking & ends up dumping them, leaving them worse than she found them. Several of them have been lovely guys who haven't done anyone any harm & she just chewed them up and spat them out broken. \n\nAlso, moving around from city to city, country to country, really fucks up a kid. Sorry for the offtopic ramblings, I might have some pent up anger issues towards my mom", "YWBTA...You're assuming that your mom treats everyone like you and yo stated that she wants to replace you. Most likely she treats her new BF and his child a lot better than how she treated you and more than likely if you say anything, it's not going to be believed because she more than likely already told them about you...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust stay out of it.
