Remember it\u2019s not your job to save her, it\u2019s up to her father. You are just sharing your experience. Don\u2019t risk your mental or physical safety for this.", "Just to add on to what everyone else is saying about warning him, provide whatever receipts and as much proof of her behavior as you possibly can. Especially since you\u2019re worried he might not believe you. \n\nIt is seriously doubtful that he really knows her true self if they\u2019ve only been dating two months. It is also very likely that any information he has about her relationship with you came directly from her and the narrative she has created. She had already been lying and spinning tales about you since before they started dating, so it\u2019s not like she will suddenly start telling him the truth. \n\nBesides, even when people aren\u2019t complete dickbags, they are usually on their best behavior and try not show any \u201cflaws\u201d in the early days of a relationship. And telling your new boyfriend that your daughter cut you off because of a lifetime of abuse is definitely not going to be a topic of conversation. Conversely, people in new relationships tend to only want to see the best in the other person, so the boyfriend might, almost instinctively, try to push back if you show up out of nowhere and start \u201ctrashing\u201d his new girlfriend.\n\nSo, basically, be prepared with as much evidence, as well as anecdotes of especially pertinent instances of abuse, and even answers to possible questions he may have. \n\nAlso, if you go into it calmly, politely, and with the angle of protecting his daughter, rather than angrily and emotionally charged, he\u2019ll probably be less inclined to think you\u2019re just trying to ruin your mom\u2019s relationship purely out of spite.\n\nSorry for the novel; I am hopelessly allergic to brevity, lol.

It\u2019s likely that the mothers partner will double down on it. There\u2019s no way OP\u2019s mother hasn\u2019t discussed OP with her partner, and she likely had nothing good to say. He doesn\u2019t know OP, so for her to say \u201cI\u2019m warning you my mother is crazy\u201d will only prove the mothers point. He has no loyalty to OP, she\u2019s a stranger to him. He\u2019ll most likely believe the mother over OP, and it will only push him closer to her.", "I have to be a bit pessimistic here in the name of ensuring you protect yourself.\n\nYWNBTA, but there's another thing to think about: The daughter could be just as bad, too. I mean, I would hope not, of course. But the boyfriend could be evil, the daughter could be a classic Mean Girl -- you don't know. If you proceed, proceed with caution.\n\nAnd if your mother has been spreading false information about you, as you mentioned in your post, she may have told the boyfriend and daughter that false info, too.

Surely the best revenge is to act like your brother never told you.\n\nToxic people like drama so by OP adding to the drama, think she would be reinforcing and rewarding her mother\u2019s behaviour.", "She knows my brother has a big mouth he can\u2019t keep a secret to save his life.

She has been telling me my whole life she could and would replace me. Like I said I\u2019m glad you seem to have never met someone like her before because people like her are truly evil but yes there is no doubt in my mind that it was intentional. Now the whole marriage thing I think might be either he\u2019s rich and she\u2019s wants his money or she\u2019s trying to get a reaction out of people because she also posted that publicly and I\u2019ve had multiple family members tell me about it.

I agree with a lot of the comments on here about her spinning the truth to make her look good. Based on your comments and post, are you sure she's mentioned you to him?

And found out through your brother she's seeing someone else. While, yes, you need to warn him and his daughter, you need to find out if they know about you first.

Let your toxic mother live her life away from you and your concerns.", "You would not be the asshole but you wouldn't do yourself a favour. \n\nYour mother is probably a perfect actress and her new man wouldn't believe some random person that suddenly appears...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ9Tczut3ko", "NTA but I think it might be more believable if it came from your brother and not her estranged daughter.", "NTA just lay out the facts and let him see for himself.\n\nmy guess is she didn't mention you to him and the similarity in names should cause some concern.", "NTA.  At least give him a understated verbal warning.\n\nMy SIL can be a terrible, selfish person.  She was engaged to a great guy for several months and after a dinner, he approached me alone and asked why I did something that SIL didn't agree with.\n\nI politely in a very brief manner said that SIL does X, Y, and Z and I don't have a lot of patience for it anymore.  BF replied \"Oh no, you simply don't know SIL that well.\"  After 15 years of living in the same town with her... yes, I know her.  So, I simply said \"Wait and see\" and politely ended the conversation.  18 months later, they broke up.  At least I put something in his field of vision he could look for.\n\nI do feel a bit bad for SIL bc she was very happy with BF, but she was also terrible to me, her brother, and our kids.", "NTA\n\nIf you do end up warning him, your mother is not going to forget it and might start seeking you out for her abuse again and maybe even escalate her behavior so be careful. If you warn him, your mother is also likely to twist things to favor her because why would this guy trust an estranged daughter over the woman he might marry? Chances are, your words will fall on deaf ears and all you will do is piss off your mother. Might be best to let nature run its course and if she's as toxic as you say she he probably has some sort of idea already or will find out very soon.  Its unfortunate that others a young lady involved but shes also getting close to 18 worst case, she would have to deal with your mom for a couple years before getting out of there. Its not ideal but you could really go ethier way. \n\nWith my emotionally abusive and narcissistic parent, I normally never have to warn them becasue they always figure it out and leave, you mom can only hold up her little act for so long. They fact that shes talking about marriage at all could be a sign something might already be up and shes looking to tie him down. Who knows but ethier way its your moms life and not yours, you can try to save people like you wanted someone to warn and save you, but you cant save everyone", "NTA but a better way to go about it is to ask your brother to talk to the boyfriend about you. Because your mom knows where you currently live (I saw in another post your moving soon which good for you, dont tell your brother where you live because your mom will probably force your brother to tell her) and if you \"ruin\" a relationship for her she will not be pleasant to say the least from what you described her as. Though I can understand not wanting to involve him in this but he is not blind and should have been able to recognize your moms abuse over the years. So even he should be concerned for the boyfriends daughter. But if you cannot trust him to be truthful doing it your self would be better.", "I would warn him and then be prepared for him to not believe you, because he\u2019s been bitten by the love bug.   But at least you will have tried to warm him.  If he and his daughter get hurt, at least you can say you tried.", "[removed]", "Is it more \\*likely\\* that OP is reading too much into this, than that the mother is on an evil crusade to replace her? yeah. But the most likely thing isn't always the true thing. Sometimes the hoof steps in the hallway really are zebras. OP has more insight into the character of their mother than we do. And sometimes, part of an evil scheme is the fact that it's so far out that no one will believe the victim, making them look crazy.", "Well that is assuming she has a reason for doing what she is doing. BUT a probable explanation is not she is looking to annoy the OP but is looking to replace the OP and get another toy to abuse. Since OP has cut her out of their life she must have some pent up frustration she cannot let loose and coincidence can be a hell of thing.  ~~So whilst she might not have purposefully sought out someone with the exact same first names  if they are not uncommon it might have just been luck of the draw and then the mother~~  (edit saw another post from the OP and it seems like its not luck of the draw or common names) realized she could get a new target if she married the new guy. Though this is all taking it as the mother is a monster there are multiple ways to interpret the action depending on which side you wanna go. Because there is also a whole redemption aspect she could be working towards.", "I\u2019d have to disagree. OP is just telling of one thing that her mother did to her, that she is worried her mother will do to this girl. Self esteem is a very important thing.", "Save for the name-thingy, I've been in a similar situation on the other side. My mother was getting involved with a man who has a history of horrible abuse. One of his daughters sent my mother a letter to warn her. \nMy mother didn't heed the warning, but I think it is great that that daughter sent the letter. Maybe I'm biased to think so, but I don't care. I can't tell you for certain whether it's right or wrong to warn your mother's boyfriend, but from the perspective of that man's daughter: you should totally do it. \n\nNTA.", "NTA and I think you should do it sooner than later. He can choose to ignore you but then that will be on him.", "NTA. BUT, big but here, is it worth it for you? Will it give you closure? Will it make you feel any better about what she\u2019s put you through? It\u2019s not your job to \u2018protect\u2019 anyone else. That\u2019s the Fathers job. If he can\u2019t see her toxicity and walk away from it that\u2019s not your fault. I think it best you just stay away from your Mum and any other awful decisions she makes", "I\u2019ll say NTA, but if this is a guy who\u2019s going to get married after two months, he\u2019s not going to care what you have to say regardless. I agree with the posts saying that if you\u2019ve cut your mom off, that means any and all forms of contact. This is a form of contact.", "It's not that you would be the AH if you warm him and I understand the desire to do so.  However like other's on this thread I would be concerned that it's not the best course of action for you.  You cut your mother off for good reasons.  If you involved yourself in her relationship now your putting yourself back into her messed up circus.  Do you really want her showing up at your door again all pissed off at you?  Or do you want to leave your mess of a mother behind and keep moving forward with your life?  I'd be more concerned about the guy knowing what your mother was like to you if his daughter was younger and your mother would actually be raising her.  But the daughter is near adult age.  And lets be honest, if this guy is actually willing to marry someone who he's only known for 2 months then he's probably not the sharpest tool in the shed and there is a good chance he wouldn't even listen to you.", "NTA.  Would your brother mention his disowned sister to the boyfriend or the boyfriend's daughter?", "Maybe if they end up meeting", ">My mother completely destroyed my self esteem and confidence when I was her age because she viewed me as competition.\n\nIf you can get any access to the guy's daughter (maybe Facebook messenger?) then tell HER this! Let the daughter know it's not her fault if she gets treated badly, and that she'll need to learn to tune out your mother. That could be super-valuable survival information for her, and could help her keep herself in one piece.", "That's exactly what you need to tell him. What you said right here. Write it down if it helps.", "[removed]", "10/10", "NTA\n\nThe new bf has a child of his own. I'd actually consider it mean to at least not warn him and he can do with it what he will. You did your due diligence. He may have suspicions and honestly deserves at least a heads up.\n\nAlso, good for you for not thinking that just because your mom is your mom that you are therefore required to allow her to abuse you for life!! No family member should get a free pass to be a horrible human being for life because they are family or because they birthed you.", "NTA be sure to cover yourself but... I would want someone to tell what I'm getting into though a marriage proposal like that would probably get me to leave.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a you being mad at your mom issue. This is a safety issue, that involves both him and his child. \n\nI would be careful how you word it though, since she sounds like a land mine. I would just tell him that you just want to make sure he understands what he is getting into, things that she\u2019s done in the past and that she hasn\u2019t really tried to change form what you\u2019ve said, and that if he still wants to continue to be with her then it\u2019s none of your business, but you want to let him know since it could be a potential hazard at best and dangerous/deadly at worst. It would take one night of her drinking and driving for him to lose his daughter.\n\nP.S.,\nNo shame to those who struggle with alcoholism. It sucks, it\u2019s hard to quit, and it ruins your life, I understand that and I hope if someone struggling is reading this that you have found healing and sobriety, but if people\u2019s lives could be in danger and if the person who is unwell is not willing to help themselves, then you have to start making some hard choices.", ">It\u2019s likely her partner won\u2019t listen. She\u2019s probably told him all about you, and how awful you are, so if he\u2019s with her, he\u2019s likely not going to believe you. And honestly, you probably don\u2019t have to worry about the teen. I\u2019m really sorry to be saying this, but it seems like she\u2019ll treat her stepdaughter better than she ever treated you.\n\nSo painful and so true. This response is so thoughtful and surely spot on. \n\nYou're not an AH. You want to warn someone against an unwell, unsafe person. If you warn him, you're not an asshole. If you don't, you're not an asshole. Clearly, you are a good heart who's been through some sh\\*t. Best of luck to you in your continued healing.", "That was one of my main thoughts if she was willing to come and pick up my brother while shit faced drunk then I can\u2019t imagine she would care with his kid in her car. She also is a cheater and she stole thousands of dollars from my father and other family members. Including myself. She took a loan out in my name when I was seven", "Gotcha", "Thats when he has an opening to say something like \"wow, your name is identical to my sister's.

At that point, it's his choice. \n\nNow, if you think there's instances of abuse, then you report it.", "Dude has been seeing your Mum for 2 months. If he agrees to be engaged, do you really think that he will listen to any sensible advice that you have to tell him?\n\nYTA if you meddle. Leave them alone.", "Feel like I have entered crazy town. Some people are train wrecks when it comes to relationships. What exactly would OP be warning the boyfriend about? Pretty sure that any guy with a kid who wants to be married after 2 months is just as bad as Mum. Or at least is thinking with his \u201cother brain\u201d. No way can OP reason with other brain.", "You said this way better than I did.
