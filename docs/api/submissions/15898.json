Freedom of religion also means freedom FROM religion. And I think said cousin needs to do a little Jesus research because even I (Wiccan) know his teachings were all about love and kindness, pretty sure calling people homophobic slurs is not in the Jesus wheelhouse.", "NTA\n\n1) He is not a \"man\" - he is a child. Not just because of his behavior, but bc he is a literal child.\n\n2) No one has any right to preach religion to you. If they can't respect that then blocking them is the correct answer - as he would do the same if you tried to sell Satanism to him.\n\n3) You aunt is an adult and should understand that her son is a shit. She is taking it out on you because she refuses to mother.", "NTA. Tell him to brush his feet off. Give this scripture to your aunt and your parents. If he wants to be a Bible thumper he needs to practice what he preaches.\n\nMatthew 10:14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.", "NTA - you lasted two months, you have amazing patience.", ">those f***\n\nHis aunt should be glad you didn't report him to the Principal for hate speech.\n\n\nnta", "NTA. There are 4AH here. Your parents, cousin and aunt. Nobody has the right to preach to you or say homophobic things just because you're relatives. And point that out. He's your cousin. Not your friend.", "NTA - hate speech is never cool in any context.\n\nSecond, anyone pushing religion like this doesn\u2019t understand the basic principles of their religion.", "NTA\n\nMaybe a little rude, but you were patient for two months. The bible speaks often in metaphors. So mabe next time you try the same: Religion is like a penis. Nice to have one but please don't shove it down the throats of other people unconsented.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you should't have said the thing about breaking his jaw but I understand that you were exhausted by two months of \"evangelization\".\n\nMaybe just a text to your aunt to say \"look, I don't and won't join your religion, please tell your kid to stop bothering me about it ^(or i will fuck up his jaw line /s)\"", "NTA\n\ngosh that sounds exhausting. maybe you shouldn\u00b4t have shouted in school, but still at least your point came across.", "NTA he\u2019s not a real Christian f*Ck em.", "NTA. You're under no obligation to listen to  your religious fanatic cousin and his fountain of hatred and intolerance. You made it clear you don't share his beliefs and , of course, he persisted. I believe an aggressive response is warranted when his aggressive attacks on you and your friends continued. If there's a next time, tell your cousin that if being \"saved\" meant spending eternity with people like him, then you'd rather go to hell. Your mother and aunt are also way out of line. Religious freedom  also means freedom from religion.", "NTA\n\nYou reap what you sow, the moment he dropped that slur all decorum goes out the window. Good for you for standing up for yourself, did you happen to mention the slur that put you over the top to your folks or aunt?", "NTA. The kid needs to stop pushing his religion on you. Its not his place. You as a person decides what religion your beliefs align with. If you don't believe in any one of them, then you don't. Your cousin needs to learn to back off and leave you and your friends alone.", "Well, I would love if someone would try to convert me. My goal would be to destroy that person\u2019s faith and make them atheist.", "NTA - Fuck religion", "NTA. Christians can be relentless in trying to get people to convert. It's harassment. Honestly the reaction may have been a little over the top but I think it's fair to say that most people would have the same reaction after being bothered and having their friends insulted for two whole months. You put up with that for a lot longer than I would have. Stick to your guns dude. If they can't respect your boundaries then they have no right to have any contact with you.", "NTA but you really should read the Bible and then you can throw his hateful rhetoric back at him. And there's  LGTBQ affirming scripture throughout. The churches have taken the words written by men in other languages and translated them to fit their purpose of hate and rejection of that which they don't understand, fear, or disapprove. For those people who say they follow Christ, they don't actually follow his actions and words very well. Jesus walked among and embraced those that were rejected, cast out, and put down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can find some LGBTQ affirming scripture here if you'd like.

If he\u2019s not going to respect a boundary you aren\u2019t obligated to continue to put up with it.", "NTA \\~ Debatable for not controlling your emotions, and falling out like that, though.  \nInstead create boundries; You do not *have* to eat lunch with him, you do not *have* to listin to him, or you can ask him to stop talking about religion in your presence.", "NTA - he\u2019s a bigot, and on top of that he\u2019s an annoying self-righteous bigot", "ESH - I'm a Christian myself and it annoys me when other Christians try to push the message onto those unwillingly. However, did you communicate with him beforehand telling him you weren't comfortable with his preaches and asking him to stop? I don't think blowing up in his face and threatening him was a good way to handle it. I understand you were angry because he used a slur at your friends, but still.", "If you're not \"required\" to eat lunch with someone else and you can eat by yourself, then YTA for your attitude and how you spoke to him. I get it that you're sick of his \"bible thumping\", but if you have a choice on eating by yourself, then do it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As soon as he started his rants you should have made it clear that he\u2019s entitled to his own opinion but it is not yours and that you have no interest in having further conversations about it.

I doubt your cousin would have respected you boundaries - however, I don\u2019t know that for sure. You are free to believe what ever you want. Your cousin has no right to push his beliefs down your throat and your aunt has not right to tell you to just listen to him.", "NTA, tell your aunt that she needs to teach her son how to be a decent human and that his discrimination against LGBT+ is not acceptable. \nIf he keeps bothering you with stuff like going to hell just reply with \"sounds like a fun place, especially since I won't have to spend it with people like you\".

Just because you have one doesn't mean it gives you the right to shove it down people's throats. Because you will do it to the wrong person and it may not end well.\n\nYour cousin needs to cool it and remember that pressuring people doesn't go his way.
