You've been harassed every damn day by this obnoxious, proselytizing, hateful, disrespectful jackass for months. Is that how Jesus wanted his followers to act? No. Is it hypocrisy like this that turns people off of religion on the first place? Yup! You only put up with it this long because he's your cousin. You can't depend on your aunt, parents or school administration to do anything about it, but you could fix it yourself. Which you did. Good job.", "NTA. And I, being petty, might find some choice Bible verses about tolerance in the words of Jesus, and maybe even that verse in Ezekiel where it explicitly says Sodom\u2019s sin was not taking care of the poor when they had such plenty. \n\nFollowing which, I would explain that his statement to you included such a foul term that when telling the story to others, you needed to censor that \u201cF\u201d word and NOT the other \u201cF\u201d word.", "In the late 1960\u2019s early 70\u2019s there were what we called Jesus freaks.

Every night he would have to listen to the loud sump pump kick on and off. He was on the kinda weird side so he made up a new religion and called it \u2018SUMP\u2019. He would tell the Jesus freaks he worshiped Sump, the great God of sump pumps. He had an entire line of shit about Sump. The Jesus freaks would leave him alone figuring he was just too weird for them. Wherever you are Tom every time I hear of people trying to force their religion on another I think of you and Sump the God of sump pumps.", "NTA lol he got a lot nicer that what he deserved. Fuck your cousin and his bigot parents", "[removed]", "NTA A lot of christians  make it their personal mission to pull as many people into their \"loving\" religion.  It's a sham.

How do some of these kids have time for the shit they do, when I  was in high school I got a new assignment every time I  blinked!

Ask your aunt what she thinks of free will? Because God grants man the ability to decide. Her son has emphatically made his point and now you get to live according to your conscience. \nBut if your cousin starts in on you again then start trying to convert him to what ever nonsense you should choose to spew.", "ESH.  Why?  Well...  \n\n*  OP should not have bottled up his resentment until his \"final straw\" was reached.  Understandable given his age, but come on.  \n\n*  Cousin should have gotten the hint and stopped proselytizing to OP.  Some people will listen to the message, and some won't.  You can't convert people via Chinese water torture.", "NTA\nSome people don't take the hint when it comes to religion.

So you're cool with rape and slavery, bible seems pretty on board with them. Etc.. I mean like really annoy the ever lovin shit outta him. At best he might start questioning his bullshit, and worst he'll hopefully be pissed off at you and stop talking to you so he stops getting questioned.", "OP, you are NTA.\n\nI say this as a woman who was raised Catholic and completely turned my back on organized religion as an adult.

There\u2019s some \u201cevidence\u201d (heard this from a history professor back in college so pinch of salt) that early Christianity (ie. before the Roman Empire fell) was much more accepting of what we would today call LGBT+ people since as people have said elsewhere Jesus was very clear about judgement, wrath and pride and sexuality was much more open during that time.
