This is the whole kerfuffle around burkhas in France as well.\n\n/u/wickedemerald74 was incorrect when they said freedom of religion also means freedom from religion. Those are two very different legal concepts and should not be confused.\n\nThe fact that people are downvoting me just shows they have more anti-religious bias than an actually desire to learn how different countries negotiate seperation of church and state.", ">depending on where OP lives, the police may be all in favour of that.\n\nWhat country has not shit cops?

In the 16th century there was a general mixing of the concepts of heretic and \u2018sodomite\u2019 due to the church. \n\nHowever, in Britain it maintained its use as a (non-gay specific) term to mean: to be seriously harmed or damaged, to express anger or disappointment, to be extremely tired, or as a general term of mild insult ie. \u2018You cheeky bugger\u2019 is often said in playful conversations and wouldn\u2019t be completely out of place being said to a kid causing mischief.", "Nowhere is perfect but these days England is pretty good.
