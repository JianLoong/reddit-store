Your cuz needs to learn NOW that being religious is not a blank check for prejudice or obnoxious behavior.\n\nLet auntie know that her special snowflake can go take a flying \u2026um, leap\u2026 until he gets the hint.\n\nAnd if he won\u2019t take no for an answer, just have a few Bible verses handy. Like the ones where Jesus or his disciples mention (in no uncertain terms) that we must first love another. Then go for the throat: Ask him if you can figure this out as an atheist, why can\u2019t he as a supposed Christian?\n\nYour cousin and his kind are one of the reasons why I\u2019m also an atheist, by the way. I want not one drop of that Kool-Aid.\n\nFinally, thanks for sticking up for your LGBT friends. Every little bit helps.", "Explain to your parents that regardless of family, his attitude towards people you care about is disrespectful and bigoted. While you are willing to put up with him at family events, you'd request he behave in a manner befitting more of a civil workplace where discussions of religion and derogatory language are frowned upon. Anything more than that you can't commit to. You're NTA and your parents sound frankly exhausted by his side of the family.", "NTA. Most Christians would consider your cousin being a crazy brainwashed fanatic sect member where I live, not a member of the two big mainstream churches because their members don't spout such nonsense normally. So no wonder that you lost your patience. You really shouldn't be forced to listen to this. And he insulted your friends! That alone already deserved your reaction.", "I am a Christian and I just have to say that your cousin is exhibiting non-christ like behavior. Not judging his standing with the man upstairs, but Jesus never treated people this way. In fact he despised the pharisees, and openly spoke out against them. Called them poisonous vipers. They were religious people who lived sinful lives behind closed doors, and judged everyone else. A lot like your cousin. Sorry you have a low view of Jesus because of people. It really sucks. But Jesus does live you, and all of your gay friends too.", "NTA.  I hate people that force religion onto others.  You didn't yell at him for the religion stuff either.  You yelled for being a homophobic asshole.  He should be embarrassed and so should the aunt.", "NTA but your whole family is. Family is disposable if they insist upon acting like A holes.", "NTA, at your age, it\u2019s difficult to stand up for yourself. I am proud of you.", "NTA no one should feel like it\u2019s their place to impose their hateful fandoms.", "Definitely NTA. Your cousin, although capable of free thought, appears to have been brainwashed by his parents and now believes it's his mission to convert everyone to save them from hell. I honestly feel kinda bad for the feller. Must be a shitty way to live a life.", "Report him for homophobic harassment (to be clear \"homophobic\" describes the intention of the harasser, not necessarily the sexual identity of the target, in this case, you, being targeted for being an ally of LGBTQ+ people) and for religiously-motivated harassment.\n\nNTA", "NTA he's a brainwashed sad little teenager", "NTA\n\nWhat happened to \"love thy neighbor\"? Sexuality and gender is not all there is to people.", "Your cousin is out of line, but it does sound like you let things come to a boil and now you're mad that you got in trouble for the inevitable explosion \n\nIn the future you need to stop things VEFORE they are a problem when possible, and for two months this was certainly possible. \n\nESH.", "NTA. Not everyone will be so \u201cnice\u201d to your cousin. Your cousin is taking advantage of people\u2019s patience, principles, and the pressure of being a model minority. His parents won\u2019t be able to pressure others into treating him as anything other than a bigot.", "NTA. Sorry about your toxic extended family. Good news is you\u2019ll be out of school soon and headed to college or starting to work. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to cut out toxic people from your life. Going No Contact is a solid plan for this situation. As for your Aunt? The fact that she is an adult doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s right or deserving of your time and attention. I\u2019d go NC with her and Uncle too.\n\nTell your parents that you are nearly an adult and will not put up with homophobic slurs against your friends. You are not obligated to have a relationship with ANYONE just because you are related to them (unless they are your own child).", ">No one has any right to preach religion ~~to~~ AT you.\n\nFIFY", "Pagan here. Went to a private Christian school from kindergarten through my freshman year of high school. The minute I was out of there and was exposed to the real world, I was absolutely appalled and disgusted by the things we were taught. Becoming pagan changed my life for the better and I love it so much! But holy hell the guilt-tripping and the \u201cyou\u2019re going to hell and IM TRYING TO SAVE YOUR SOUL\u201d excuse is just sickening.", "I seem to remember when I was in school when one of these people started on us a couple of my friends would start going on about being satanists and trying to concert them right back (they weren\u2019t they were just screwing with them to freak them out and shut them up, it usually worked lol).\n\nNTA- your cousin needs to back off. You don\u2019t owe him anything and he is harassing you. Maybe get headphones and anytime he comes over just pop them in and turn your back to him and ignore him. The more you respond the more he thinks he has. Just tell him he\u2019s pathetic and wasting his time then just ignore him. \n\nNTA- you\u2019re never an AH for standing up for others or shutting down religious zealots.", "Pretty sure Jesus would be pissed", "Pretty sure Jesus would be pissed", "It does not mean freedom from religion. That is a concept in France not America. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to wear a cross in a public institution.", "OP was inexperienced in the ways of persistent proselytizers, so it's understandable that he thought cousin would give up after a while.  Now he knows how it goes if you try to be nice to them.", "People like this are why so many end up turning away from religion", "You won't. They just get really annoyed when you defeat their arguments with logic and reason, call you names, and stomp off in a huff.\n\nEdit \nAlso OP totally NTA. Imo you deserve some sort of award for putting up with it for so long.", "> Repeat 3 times if necessary and then if that is ignored\n\nOnce is enough.", "If they aren\u2019t around to hear them. That goes beyond being religious and is just regular bigotry.", "Tell them If heaven is full of people like him hell sounds like the better option.", "Thinking any time he comes over start recording very obviously- if he says it again you have proof and you can take it to the principal. Most schools have policies against harassment and hate speech.", "It\u2019s not about them reevaluating. It\u2019s about speaking to them in a way they will listen. If they only listen to scripture than use it for your advantage.", "I've started telling them that their god frowns upon them for using his name to hate on others. Idk what gymnastics they come up with next after that because i stop paying attention afterwards", "Has it ever worked for you? Not asking with an attitude, just curious if anyone has ever demonstrated mental growth as a result of it.", "Not the same person you were talking to, but I've never seen it work ever, and I don't even try that anymore. They just try to tell you that you don't understand the context of whatever verse like you have no idea what you're talking about, even if you spent decades deeply in that religion and that's why you disagree with them now", "I've had to weaponize the Bible against people who use the Bible as a weapon. I've yet to have anyone blatantly change their mind but I at least get them off my ass when they find out I can and will talk them into a corner. They dislike the shame corner more than they dislike my refusal to join their cult."]}
