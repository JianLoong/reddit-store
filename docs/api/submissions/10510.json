I've only had a problem with pets using regular plates when some of my spouses relatives allow their dogs to eat off the plates during family celebrations. I'm not talking about them allowing the dogs to eat off their own plate, I'm talking about them allowing the dogs to eat off the plates that contain the food everyone is to eat (picture a dog eating ham off the plate its out on to be served or a dog eating the green bean casserole out of the serving dish). Now that is disgusting! \n\nMy own dogs will sit by the dishwasher while I'm loading it to try and lick reminents off the dishes. Soap, hot water, and the sanitize cycle and their good as new.", "Not to mention, cats and dogs\u2019 tongues are also their toilet paper so when they clean themselves they\u2019re literally covered in smidges of their own shit. \n\nAnd yes, I own a cat.", "Toe beans!", "Yeah what about Pasteurella multocida. Bacteria that can cause infections in humans, the fact that cats and dogs both groom themselves and as you said already those litter boxes aren\u2019t so sanitary why would you share a plate with the cat.\nYes I understand how soap works but regardless it\u2019s a bad practice to be mixing animal and human stuff especially when I\u2019m going to be ingesting food from that plate.  Microorganisms that aren\u2019t permeable through the skin barrier might cause infections when ingested. I\u2019m honestly surprised how people are so ok with this.\nAs for op I don\u2019t think he should get back with her and I don\u2019t think she should either. Both have different values and ways. I know when people have their ways they can be defensive about it.", "I think the problem would be the cats licking the plates rather than the cat food itself. Even so, as long as they get washed it's fine.", "Yes cats salvia can harbour salmonella same as dogs, it gets picked up mostly from infected animals but the change to catch salmonella from your pet is quite low. In general every animal ( and humans) have bacteria in their mouths that can lead to infections but cats actually can cause something called cat scratch disease too. But usually if you use common sense hygiene, you should be fine.", ">Apparently she told one of the friends we both share and they text me saying I was a jerk for telling her what to do with her own things.\n\nSounds like she already told their friends why she dumped him.", "right \ud83d\ude2d idk why people acting like that\u2019s totally normal", "100%", "Im over here surprised so many people agree, im glad im not eating at these peoples houses.", "Bruh we share everything else with animals why are plates off limits? I\u2019m willing to bet y\u2019all do things much more unsanitary than this on the daily. Also, washing dishes is a thing.", "I\u2019m also confused about the YTA comments, this is why I don\u2019t eat in everyone\u2019s home. If she needs to use something to serve the cat food then she should have a specific spoon that she only uses for that.", "right like are these people sane ?\ud83d\ude2d i can\u2019t believe they\u2019re calling this guy an asshole and telling him to grow up for finding this gross !", "Faulty argument saying it's ok because they get washed I agree. I'll let a homeless person shit a plate and then wash it. Let's see how many of these people will eat from said plate.", "I hear this and cringe because anyone you meet ever might not wipe / might not have washed their hands / showered in lord knows how long. And then you give them a high five.", "My dog has his own cup and plate and recently claimed his own fork. Someone may have fed him dinner with a fork since he didn't like how his food looked. The only reason they are set aside for him is becuase one family member doesn't like the idea of sharing with him and that's ok they aren't an ass about it like Op. But my siblings are like I don't care I'll pay Franklin his share for letting me borrow his stuff \ud83d\ude0a", "Except the ceiling. Yet.", "Oh my God my in-laws dog loves going for the silverware when they're loading the dishwasher. She just wants to lick up all the food", "Sounds like the kind of guy that enjoys having it performed on him, but won\u2019t return the favour cuz he thinks it\u2019s gross that pee came out of the same area", "With cats?", "All the comments with people saying they let their slobbery dogs go to town on their dirty dishes \ud83e\udd22\n\nWe must be in the minority here I guess.", "Right like that\u2019s obvious. Ick. That\u2019s why I never participated in pot lucks.", "It is always great to learn what my viewpoints as a minority should be... \ud83d\ude44\n\nMy family would feed strays from plastic take out containers, run them through the dishwasher,  then use them to store leftovers. Our dishes served multiple function but were cleaned properly. I don't think that is going to get me cancelled on BlackTwitter \ud83d\ude02", "OP would flip out in my house. I make most of my dogs food (not a raw diet) and use human plates to heat it up, cut it up, and scoop it into their bowls!", "its easier then trying to tap it or force it out by shaking it violently also less messy, the spoon or fork gets washed so it's w/e \n\nsimple solution for jerko is to not date anyone who has pets", "Mine too! They sit right next to the dishwasher while I am loading it to try and get a taste of the meal from the plates.", "Jumping out before they're shampooed and shaking for all they were worth everywhere is what ours did .  And why Dad put them in the wash tub in the backyard.  Mom would've probably lost it if Sam and CJ or Sonic and Riley had done that in the house.  And of course, Dad would get thoroughly soaked in the process.  \n\nOf course, Riley thought my parents' pond was a great substitute to use as a batth and cool off though.  Unfortunately there were  a few unintended casualties as a result of his leap into it.", "I'm reading this while my dog looks at me, impatiently waiting for me to finish my semolina pudding so he can do his job and clean the bowl", "It's the same with cats if there's gravy involved.", "I'm sure there was a post on here were someone used at as a wash....", "My cats pre-wash almost everything I put in the sink", "Same, except I own large dogs.\nThey also eat raw. Ever been woken up at 5.00 am by a raw meat fart to the face???", "ts also wasteful. Reusing stuff is just smart.", "Ngl, I've eaten off the same plate as my rats (rip fatty mcfatface, nemo and speed). I made them banana oatmeal with honey, and after a while I went to clean it and WITHOUT A THOUGHT scooped the leftovers into my mouth.\n\nNot my proudest moment, but I survived.", "It's dirty as fuck", "I hate that I know what you are referencing. I hate that I am reminded of this, too", "If the human spoon is a spoon made from human bones, then yes.", "Also how would you divvy up two plates from one can without a utensil? Just shake out half of a semi-liquid substance? Buddy needs to get real.", "Mine has a side plate for wet food and a shallow bowl for crunchies. All set out on a large serving tray to catch spills.", "How though? My little mung bean drops half of it on the floor even using a bowl. I can't imagine the mess if I put it on a saucer.", "That's what I always used too. They are the perfect size. It sounds like this guy just doesn't like cats and if someone spoke to me the way he did he would be gone.", "We also use saucers. We get them from charity shops and second hand places for cheap. They have some nice vintage saucers that they eat food off! Our trio eat raw food (biggest cat has food sensitivity, other two are sphynxes and need lots of food, feeding raw was cheapest and most filling) and honestly it actually looks appetizing. They have regular bowls for biscuits but we got them really nice vintage-style bowls.", "Used to have a dog who did this so thoroughly, I often joked about how we could just save time and put them back in the cabinet since you couldn't even tell they were dirty now.", "My cat waits for my son's cereal bowls also, her personal favourite is Weetabix", "When I was a kid my sister's cat always got my left-over oatmeal. He loved it, probably mostly because it was made in full-fat milk...", "You should report that lol", "Lol same. I get a variety bucket of self-scoop treats for my dog at our local pet store. You bet your butt I've sampled a number of them out of curiosity. Bacon and maple, blueberry and oats, cheese and flax seed. Like, those are just slightly more bland and dry than normal people cookies! He has some Christmas shaped ones left still, and they straight up just taste like blander ginger snaps lol. I've tried his kibble too, it's...also bland and vaguely meat flavored. OP must think I am absolutely feral hahaha", "Why? They get washed.", "Sucks to be you. What a waste of money. You could have just had two children. One to wash the people dishes and one to wash the cat dishes.\n\n /s", "We have Fiestaware dishes and use the buffet plates to feed the cats soft food once a day.  Their bowls for dry food are the vegetable serving bowls.  Ceramic is good for chin acne as well so long as it's not cracked.  Fiesta is really tough and doesn't break easily.  We eat off the same dishes.  I don't use plastic much as it can harbor bacteria, and not just for the cat acne.  Even my lunch to take to work was in a glass container before I worked at home.", "Somebody has to be the early warning sign for when gravity finally gives out. It's a hard job, but if not for your cat, who would be willing to take it on?", "Haha we have the same in our house but a beagle best cleaner ever especially when you have a weaning messy 11 month old baby lol. The high chair is her most favourite thing ever lol. Haha jokes aside I do wipe/disinfect everything down after she has finished before next time.", "Ours are vacuums/ brooms.
