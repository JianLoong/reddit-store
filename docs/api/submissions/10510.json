She usually gets two small plates from her stack of small plates and splits the wet food half/half for the cars, using a spoon from the drawer of silverware to scoop it out. Yesterday, she fed the cats their wet food when I was there and I saw her get the plates and spoon, open the container, and put the wet food onto those plates. I thought that was absolutely unsanitary and disgusting and told her so when she sat back down. I added she should just do what I told her a while ago and that was to get the cats their own dishes.\n\nShe told me it was her house, her cats, and her dishes and silverware so I had no right to tell her what she should do with them. She also said she spends extra time with cleaning the plates (extra soap and harder scrubbing). I replied and told her she's disgusting and will turn into a cat lady who shares silverware with her cats without washing them.\n\nShe got angry and told me to get out because I insulted her so I gladly left.
