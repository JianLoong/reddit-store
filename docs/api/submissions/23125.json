It\u2019s an easy thing for your mom to say, because she\u2019s not the one who suffers the damage when it comes. You are, which means you get to decide if you want to risk that damage.\n\nIs your sibling staying there a temporary thing? If so, the safest thing for you is to reschedule for a time when sibling simply won\u2019t be there.

Your mother is right about one thing: you shouldn\u2019t have to feel you have to avoid family\u2026. Yet here you are having to do just that because of a toxic sibling. Your parents are not taking this seriously enough so you have no reason to believe they will step in when your sibling kicks off with the abusive behaviour again.

Trust once destroyed gets earned back not just assumed. Your mother says your sibling has changed, but you don't know that.
