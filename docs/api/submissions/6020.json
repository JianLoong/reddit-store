Think \"I walked to school uphill both ways in the snow\" kinds of stories. It's not harmful, it's part of growing up. \n\nFrankly, I suspect it actually helps kids to develop a sense of \"hmm, this story seems off\" as they grow up. It even helps them learn that the adults in their lives are people too: some of them talk too much, some of them repeat the same boring stories over and over, some of them exaggerate or make things up... And none of that stops them from being an important person in the child's life. In the long run, it helps them learn that people are more than just the stories that they tell\n\nOne of my fondest memories from when I was about your children's age was my grandfather telling me--in a completely serious tone--that he was going to walk on the ceiling later, and that the rug I was making (some sort of craft project) was great because it would let him wipe the mud off his shoes and not leave dirty footprints all over my mother's ceiling. I was thoroughly confused for an extended length of time. I started playing along because...well, what else was I going to do? I loved my grandpa, and didn't want to *not* talk to him just because I didn't know what he was talking about. It was many hours later (or possibly even the next day) before I realized it was a joke, and it became an occasional inside joke of ours for years. I wouldn't have traded those moments with my grandfather for anything, certainly not for a bigger dose of \"reality\"\n\nYTA if you interfere with a harmless story she's telling, especially since it seems like the only reason you care is because *you* are embarrassed by it. If you truly believed that it was harmful to your children (e.g. it would make them think it was safe to wander off alone or something), that would be different. But since that's not the case, you need to let your mother develop her relationship with her grandchildren on her own terms", "YTA - If you can not without a doubt disprove her story, then you have no say in whether or not it's true.

If you think the kids are too young and would be scared by this story, it's fine to ask her to wait until they're older.\n\nMy mom believes her ex husband's ghost sits on her bed each year on their anniversary.

So ask her to stop talking about it when you are present and be done with it. This isn't about your kids at all. Kids would just roll with it. Can't even see them having nightmares either unless you're letting them watch Aliens and they correlate the movie to her encounter. \n\nYou owe your mother a sincere apology and explanation of your own embarrassment when she starts talking about it.

The way you\u2019re describing it here sounds pretty dismissive of her and her story though, and if that\u2019s how you spoke to her about it then I think you may be TA.\n\nI know aliens are a more \u201cout there\u201d thing, but there is a good amount of evidence for believing that they exist and that humans have come across them, or signs of them.

All I\u2019m saying is that I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to treat her like she\u2019s nuts because of this if she\u2019s totally reasonable and lovely otherwise.

Dealing in absolutes is hardly ever a good thing. You insisting that your Mother is either making this story up, or is crazy, is shameful. Who are you to say what she did or didn't see? Were you there? Just because you haven't seen something, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. \n\nThere have been many instances over the years, where what we knew to be true was, in fact, not.

One day, some friend or family member will speak about it in front of your kids, and they will be curious.

Everyone has weird stories about ghosts, aliens etc. Her having this experience DOES NOT CHANGE she is sweet. You are the one who judges her as crazy for saying something that for her is true.", "My grandfather rented an elephant, painted it pink and used it to promote a used car sale. Weird stories are kind of the point of grandparents \n\nGet a life (or some therapy), accept your mom for who she is, and next time don't ruin Christmas 'kay? \n\nYTA", "YTA  \n\n\nshe saw an object flying in the sky she could not identify  \n\n\nliterally a UFO  \n\n\nits a harmless story and everyone has those types of things to tell", "YTA. Kind of, anyway. Whatever it was she saw plus her sister dying so soon after has affected the rest of her life. I hope she has a therapist or is in another form of therapy. \n\nYou could ask her to hold off telling them until they're older. Beyond that I don't know you have any other choice unless you plan on going no contact.", "YTA.\n\nTell your mom to create a Reddit account to post her story because I would absolutely love to hear all about it", "YTA. \n\nYour kids are at an age where they would appreciate such a story. Unless they're young Sheldons. \n\nI wonder if you also ban all things Disney, and story books, since all the stories are made up.", "YTA - Seriously your Mum's story is wonderful not scary or horrid.  As someone who had one Grandmother would do a full dramatic interpretation of her nemesis', wife of boyfriend, gory suicide in front of the fireplace, only thing missing was the fake blood or would show you her very ugly mastectomy scars while telling you if you were a naughty child this is what the Drs would do to you, I would have paid for a nice UFO story. Even my grandfather's tales of war were pleasant - my fave being how difficult it was to get some of the dead into their coffins and having to be very inventive with the saws....", "YTA, let's hope you see a UFO and cross our fingers that it makes you loosen up.", "Yes YTA, you sound really boring too", "YTA. Is it really any more embarrassing than an overly religious relative? Just bc you don\u2019t believe in aliens doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. Teach your kids critical thinking skills and stop trying to make mom some perfect character.", "YTA Who in the hell cares if your kids hear the story. It doesn\u2019t do any harm and since you can\u2019t unequivocally prove that it didn\u2019t happen, then leave it the crap alone.", "YTA. A ufo is an unidentified object in the sky.  Not the Millennium Falcon.\n\nBut don\u2019t let her take your kids camping.  Just in case", "YTA for being so controlling. Tell your mom to come tell us her UFO story!", "YTA. This has nothing to do with your kids. This has to do with your second hand embarrassment.", "Grandfathers always had \u201cwar stories\u201d in my generation. We grew up hearing about what they did in the war. I can still remember my maternal grandfather cleaning an ulcer on his leg and telling me it was from where a piece of shrapnel landed and is now buried in the bone.\n\nMy grandfather fought inside a tank\u2026.", "NTA and there seems to be some people who got lost, on their way to r/conspiracy, here...\n\nIt's not unreasonable to want you're mother's detachment from reality kept from your kids, until they're old enough to deal with it.", "Gotta agree. When I was a kid, my mom told me about the UFO my grandma saw in upstate NY in the 60s and it sparked a lifelong interest in the unexplained. As long as she doesn\u2019t scare the kids needlessly, I think it\u2019s fine. I think you need to chill out a bit OP. YTA", "Technically, she did see a UFO. There was something she couldn't identify. That doesn't mean it was aliens though.\n\nIn all honesty older people regularly say pretty insane things, when I was a kid my great grandma suddenly decided salt was poison. Handling it well will help the kids grow into more functional and well adjusted adults. \n\nIf they learn that \"sometimes grandma's and grandpa's tell confusing and strange stories\" they will be able to handle it when an older person tells them that Pokemon cards are the work of satan or 5G makes you infertile.", "OP Must not have watched Independance Day!", "No not really, they like Santa in the abstract and as an object of decoration but we actively tell them that presents coke from people that care about them", "I actually didn\u2019t say anything like that at all but I\u2019m a little dubious that aliens came all this way to intercept my mom and her sister oj the highway after they snuck out of their house at 19 and 16 to go hook up with Air Force pilots they met on the beach.", "I\u2019ve posted a short version in other comments if uoi want to see more", "On the crazy grandparent scale,  the UFO's Are Real grandma is relatively harmless. And she's infinitely better than the Racist Conspiracy Theory grandma.", "Seriously, I'd be pissed if I learned my grandma had a UFO story she never told me!", "That is exactly how it works what are you talking about? OP can't say that she never saw aliens, because OP wasn't there, they have no way other than a simple assumption or \"disbelief\". Even your own statement of betting your life stills implies the protentional for you to be disproved. There is no fact here, because it's all a theory. Until it's 100% disproved (which her experience cannot be disproved) She is well within her right to share this experience with whomever she chooses.", "No, that's not normal. That beyond \"I might have seen something and misinterpreted it\" territory and shoots straight into delusion. She doesn't need validation, she needs psychological treatment. \n\nYou are not crazy because you won't let her teach your children that aliens came down from the sky to observe her. You are doing the right thing. \n\nNo matter what way you say that you don't believe in the delusion, she's going to be hurt. There is no way to please someone suffering from a delusion short of fully participating in the delusion as well. As uncomfortable as it makes you, imagine how your children will feel not being able to advocate for themselves and being forced to listen to it. And what if they truly believe in her delusion?!", "NTA. Please keep that away from your children or teach it to them in the same vein as Santa. It's okay for them to have magic and wonder, but this is something that could cause fear or lead to conspiratorial beliefs. I think you're doing the right thing, but maybe shouldn't have brought it up on Christmas day. It's also a very difficult lesson to teach children that their eyes and their memories are not absolute.... You want to believe your brain wouldn't lie to you, but it does. It almost sounds like this has turned into a religion to your mother and I would keep an alien religion away from my children.", "Hold up, your mom\u2019s sister was a teenager when she passed away and you\u2019re being this much of a jerk about her story? That makes it so much worse.", "I think yta but I don\u2019t know why this specific comment is getting downvoted. I want the link!", "Storytellers have a long and colorful history. Stephen King makes up stories...", "My late grandmother lived with my family as I was growing up. That woman was not only more than a bit racist, she also had more bizarre superstitions than I could list here. Some of them scared the ever-loving crap out of me when I was little. Like if her rocking chair was rocking without her in it, it meant *she would die.* \n\nI found this gem out because I was sprawled on the flooring reading a book and apparently my foot made her chair rock. She saw it as she was coming into the room and she lost her mind. Screamed at 10yo me that I must have wanted her to die. That was frankly traumatic as hell.\n\nAliens would have been less freaky to me. \n\n(Fun part\u2014my dad, her son-in-law, was a very pragmatic and logical guy. Not at all superstitious. He found it hilarious to break mirrors, walk under ladders, even rescue black cats, etc., just to drive her bonkers!)", "My aunt was a small child in the crowd with my grandparents when the Hindenburg went up in flames!  And she never thought to tell me this in the 60+ years she knew me!!!  (\"I thought you knew!\")  \n\n\nOkay, at least that was a provable event.  But even so!", "This idea that something can be true unless it is 100% disproven is unfortunate and, quite frankly, fucking insane.", "Stories about flying tigers are not true.", "I mean. He makes up stories in the framework of overt fiction which does not claim to be real. I\u2019m not really invested in the underlying moral dispute here so I\u2019m not trying to argue with you. Simply pointing out that OP\u2019s issue seems less based on things like that and more on how he wants his kids relationship to be with their grandmother.", "Your point with this is what? You're comparing an apple to an ion and it's entirely irrelevant but I will play your game. \n\nA tiger is biologically known not to have wings, therefore, a flying tiger does not exist in a biological sense. This is fact (if there were such a thing, it would be classified as something other than a traditional tiger) \n\nAliens have not been proven nor disproven. There are more facts and theories that point to their existence than points to nonreality of them. So disprove her claim, and you can call her crazy, senile, whatever, until you can do that, let her be.", "Thanks for the giggle!", "I wonder if they'll respond to this beast of a comment", "> A tiger is biologically known not to have wings, therefore, a flying tiger does not exist in a biological sense.\n\nWho says you need wings to fly?\n\n> disprove her claim, and you can call her crazy, senile, whatever, until you can do that, let her be.\n\nI saw a wingless flying alien that looked exactly like a tiger. I'm not crazy, disprove my claim.\n\nI believe in aliens dude, just not anyone who says aliens came up thier car, had a bit of a stare then flew away.", "Either way OP NTA if my mom tried to tell any kids I have the earth is flat or Bigfoot exists or the reptilian are real that'd be a no shut tf up to my kids.\n\nLike any paranormal conspiracies are a no, why should OP need a deeper reason than paranormal conspiracy is misinformation and not good to portray as a real thing?", "They did... And just ended up proving my point further on accident.", "You're literally proving my own point lol. I can't disprove any claims unless I myself was there to see it. That's the same with Bigfoot, Nessie, the Jersey devil, all of these cryptic's etc. Hell, even religion.  Just because you don't believe it, doesn't make it untrue.", "Okay those are completely different scenarios then what Op described in their original story lol", "No I'm trying to do a \"reductio ad absurdum\", where I show how your reasoning leads to an absurd position. But your response seems to be \"yes that is my position\".", "So I legit had an ex that claimed to see fairies. Are we okay with a parent telling their child that they see fairies?", "They are all crypto-science conspiracy theories with no basis in reality. \"I saw Bigfoot, in the forest\" is no different than \"I saw aliens who stared at me, on the highway\"", "Sure? why not? It's their child, when the child is old enough, they can decide whether or not to believe it themselves. We tell children Santa is real, and many believe it, until they are old enough to decide for themselves whether it's true or not.", "> We tell children Santa is real\n\nKnowing full well he isn't real and that our children will discover he isn't real. Like a game of pretend.\n\n> Sure? why not? It's their child\n\nWell, like I said, I was trying to show how your reasoning leads to absurd positions. If you think it's okay to teach children that fairies exist, then I'm not going to be able to convince you of anything at all."]}
