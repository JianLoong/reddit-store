They snuck out of the house fo drive to Vegas to meet these guys.\n\nOn the highway They saw a triangular ship that hovered over them and followed them for several miles. then they came over a hill and another craft was parked in the middle of the road intending to stop the car. She and her sister were frozen and all the electronics died. several of the \u201cnormal big eye\u201d aliens approached the car and stared at them for several minutes before returning to the second ship which lifted off and was \u201cabsorbed\u201d into the main ship. My mom says then several military vehicles came from behind them on the road and followed the triangular ship towards Las Vegas. They sat there for another hour or so then turned around and never met up with the guys and confessed to my grandparents what had happened. My grandpa said to necer speak of it again and about a week later her sister died in a car crash in pacific beach. \n\nOP: In the early 80s my mom claims to have seen a UFO with her sister (now passed away) while driving from San Diego to Nevada. To me the story is one of two things: she saw some sort of military aircraft and imagined or invented the rest. Second possibility is it\u2019s a total fabrication that she invented to cover up the pain of losing her sister who died in a car accident a few weeks after their road trip.\n\nWhatever the truth is, the story of seeing a UFO was a pivotal life event for her and she will bring it up constantly. To her credit the story has stayed consistent over the years. People are generally polite when she tells it but you can tell they are uncomfortable, think that she\u2019s lying and try to change the subject then avoid her. I feel so much second hand embarrassment but she motors right through.\n\nMy kids are old enough (6 and 4) where I know she is going to start telling them the story. I don\u2019t want them to see her like that. I want her to be the sweet grandma who makes great waffles not the look who says aliens approached her on the highway. \n\nAt Christmas I finally brought it up to her and I clearly hurt her feelings. She said she knows what she say and it affected her deeply and changed how she views and reacts to the world. But if that\u2019s my wishes she\u2019ll respect it\u2014but it hurt her for sure.\n\nAITA for placing this limit on her?", "created_utc": 1672412780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz2oy5/aita_got_telling_my_mon_she_is_never_to_tell_her/", "score": 339, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Think \"I walked to school uphill both ways in the snow\" kinds of stories. It's not harmful, it's part of growing up. \n\nFrankly, I suspect it actually helps kids to develop a sense of \"hmm, this story seems off\" as they grow up. It even helps them learn that the adults in their lives are people too: some of them talk too much, some of them repeat the same boring stories over and over, some of them exaggerate or make things up... And none of that stops them from being an important person in the child's life. In the long run, it helps them learn that people are more than just the stories that they tell\n\nOne of my fondest memories from when I was about your children's age was my grandfather telling me--in a completely serious tone--that he was going to walk on the ceiling later, and that the rug I was making (some sort of craft project) was great because it would let him wipe the mud off his shoes and not leave dirty footprints all over my mother's ceiling. I was thoroughly confused for an extended length of time. I started playing along because...well, what else was I going to do? I loved my grandpa, and didn't want to *not* talk to him just because I didn't know what he was talking about. It was many hours later (or possibly even the next day) before I realized it was a joke, and it became an occasional inside joke of ours for years. I wouldn't have traded those moments with my grandfather for anything, certainly not for a bigger dose of \"reality\"\n\nYTA if you interfere with a harmless story she's telling, especially since it seems like the only reason you care is because *you* are embarrassed by it. If you truly believed that it was harmful to your children (e.g. it would make them think it was safe to wander off alone or something), that would be different. But since that's not the case, you need to let your mother develop her relationship with her grandchildren on her own terms", "YTA - If you can not without a doubt disprove her story, then you have no say in whether or not it's true.

If you think the kids are too young and would be scared by this story, it's fine to ask her to wait until they're older.\n\nMy mom believes her ex husband's ghost sits on her bed each year on their anniversary. My (now grown) kids have heard this story many times. They just think it's a quirky grandma thing. They have a wonderful relationship with her.", "I can't decide if anyone is because I'm enjoying the irony of doing this at christmas when presumably the children are told Santa Clause brought gifts. \n\nIf I'm wrong and there's no santa clause stories told in the house then I'm TA", "YTA.

You had to do it at Christmas? \n\nYour embarrassment when she tells the story is the problem. Not that it's going to somehow harm your children. YOU don't want to hear it. So ask her to stop talking about it when you are present and be done with it. This isn't about your kids at all. Kids would just roll with it. Can't even see them having nightmares either unless you're letting them watch Aliens and they correlate the movie to her encounter. \n\nYou owe your mother a sincere apology and explanation of your own embarrassment when she starts talking about it.

I don\u2019t want anyone telling them god and heaven and hell are real, and I don\u2019t want anyone telling them aliens are real and might interact with them.

I think the kids are too young for it and it might give them nightmares so she shouldn't tell them yet.... However I would have found it hilarious if my grandma had an alien encounter and so I think when they are teenagers it's fine for her to share the story, especially if it was pivotal to her life.", "You hurt her feelings.. obviously you didn't find a way to deliver your message that wouldn't hurt.. \n\n\"Hey the kids are too young to understand.. wait till older..\"\n\"Hey the topic would scare them.. let's wait.. \"\n\n\n\nyeah YTA", "INFO: it kind of depends on how you went about placing this limit?

The way you\u2019re describing it here sounds pretty dismissive of her and her story though, and if that\u2019s how you spoke to her about it then I think you may be TA.\n\nI know aliens are a more \u201cout there\u201d thing, but there is a good amount of evidence for believing that they exist and that humans have come across them, or signs of them. Yeah it\u2019s not certain, but it\u2019s not an impossibility at all. All I\u2019m saying is that I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to treat her like she\u2019s nuts because of this if she\u2019s totally reasonable and lovely otherwise. Let her tell them her story when they\u2019re a good bit older, and allow them to make their own judgements on it. Maybe they\u2019ll think grandma is kind of eccentric and kooky but not judge her for it, or maybe it\u2019ll pique an interest in outer space for them! Either way it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing, and kids love a good story that gets them thinking", "YTA. I don't see how that is going to be a big deal to your kids, they will love their grandma no matter what silly stories she tells, and you can always 'have a talk' with them about it later on if it seems to be sticking in the wrong way.  It seems like this is something that really bothers YOU, and you are using your kids like a poor excuse to have a go at your mom about the annoying story that she likes to share.", "NAH\n\nThey're your kids, and you have a right to have them around certain things or not. \n\nHowever, I personally see nothing wrong with her story. Dealing in absolutes is hardly ever a good thing. You insisting that your Mother is either making this story up, or is crazy, is shameful. Who are you to say what she did or didn't see? Were you there? Just because you haven't seen something, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. \n\nThere have been many instances over the years, where what we knew to be true was, in fact, not. Now, I'm not saying UFOs, or aliens for that matter, do exist, but I'm not saying they don't, either.

It seems like she is seeking validation and the opportunity to talk to people who will not roll their eyes and avoid her.\n\nA blanket prohibition about talking to her grandchildren about her experience won't hold forever.  One day, some friend or family member will speak about it in front of your kids, and they will be curious.  Please don't tell them \"Grandmother is nuts, don't listen to her.\"\n\nYou are thinking this prohibition will protect your children somehow, or just save them some embarrassment.
