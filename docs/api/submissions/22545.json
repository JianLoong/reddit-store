It usually goes something like this: we\u2019re having a group conversation at some gathering with friends or family.  Usually when the conversation about something todo with dairy comes up she usually makes this comment \u201cFor someone who is lactose intolerant, I don\u2019t understand why he likes cheese some much\u201d. For example the one time our friend was having a BBQ and offered me a burger, he then asked me what type of cheese I wanted in my burger. I proceeded to ask what they had, after he listed them I made my choice and was having a conversation with our friend on how \u201ccheese product\u201d is not real cheese. Well shortly after there she was making that comment again.  This usually follows up with people asking the side effects of lactose intolerance etc, and I usually end the conversation explaining that most cheese don\u2019t actually contain lactose there for doesn\u2019t affect me.  This has gotten to be quite annoying and embarrassing depending on the questioning, but I don\u2019t usually make a big deal about it since we are amongst other people and don\u2019t want to make it awkward. We\u2019ve been together for over 10 years, and I had hoped that after me explaining this several time she would \u201cunderstand\u201d and stop bringing this up.\n\nWell today we were cooking dinner, I was prepping some pasta and mentioned that this would probably go good with some blue cheese sauce we had in the fridge\u2026 and like clockwork there was that stupid comment again.  Now I\u2019ll be honest I was already aggravated about something else that happened earlier in the day.  I couldn\u2019t resist and just went off on her about her making this comment repeatedly during our 10 years together, and that I would think by how many times I had explained she would have learned by now that cheese doesn\u2019t affect her husband and would stop putting me in this embarrassing situation every chance she gets (Among other not so nice things). \n\nNow we\u2019re just sitting here not talking to each other at the moment, and I\u2019m just wondering if I over did it.\n\nEdit: I went to the gym to decompress and then came back and apologized for my snapping reaction.  I explained that I\u2019m bothered by that comment, not necessary because of the comment itself but because she has made it numerous times through the years despite my explanation.  I also asked as some of you suggested why she feels the need to keep mentioning it.   She says she didn\u2019t think much of it, and that she just finds it ironic that I like cheese so much despite my condition.  So I iterated again that it does not bother me and to please stop bringing this up specially in public.  And yes I did ask if she was secretly trying to tell me that I am stealthy turning into a human stink bomb and didn\u2019t realize it, and the answer was no.", "created_utc": 1689639190, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152iosa/aita_for_snapping_at_my_wife_who_keeps_iterating/", "score": 70, "replies": ["My husband does something similar.  I had bariatric surgery 11 years ago and I have issues eating certain foods.  I have a secondary condition that causes dysphasia in my esophagus.  This generally results in my having to stop eating immediately until my esophagus relaxes and things start working again. \n\nSo we love to go out to eat.  And 9/10 times I eat about 25% of my food and I box the rest.  I am also and extremely SLOW eater.  It doesn\u2019t stop me from enjoying the experience at all. I love to sit with my husband while he enjoys his meal. We talk about all sorts of things and I truly enjoy his company. \n\nCue the waitress or waiter who will ask me \u201cif everything ok with your meal\u201d.  I expect this every time bc it\u2019s not usual to see a patron sitting there with almost an entire meal in front of them unless there\u2019s a problem. I prefer to just say \u201cmy meal is delicious, I\u2019m just a slow eater\u201d. Not my husband tho. He has to blurt out that I had weight loss surgery and I have dysphasia so i can\u2019t eat like most other people. \ud83d\ude44\n\nFinally one day, I snapped right in front of a waitress and I told him I was sick of him dishing out my personal medical info.  Thankfully, I just had ti be blunt about it once and he doesn\u2019t do it anymore.

Due to medical reasons.\n\nHe saw me in the food court at work eating fried food.\n\nHe came up to the table where I was eating with a friend and said \"are you supposed to be eating that?\" Every single table within 50' went silent. No joke.\n\nI looked at him and said \"I'm going to be miserable either way. To either not eat anything I like... Or eat something I like making me happy and be miserable later.

Just based on your post, I would have said NTA but looking at your comments, it doesn\u2019t help your case. You really need to talk to your wife about how her talking about your lactose intolerance to other people, makes you feel. You can\u2019t just randomly lose your shit at her like that. Go make amends - apologise but also explain how her talking about that stuff makes you feel.", "I'm lactose intolerant, not severely so but I am. Cheese does not bother me in the slightest but milk, no matter what kind and ice cream and all that?? Those things hit me hardd so I get it.\n\nThat said ESH. From your comments you haven't specifically said to your wife hey this bothers me, you didn't sit down with her and discuss this so you're slight asshole for that .\n\nYour wife is an ah because after 10 years of hearing cheese doesn't affect me still chooses to bring it up and harp on and on about it. Hell she lives with you so if your ass was on fire after eating the cheese she'd know. It's unnecessary to keep pushing bringing this up. \n\nBoth of yall need to sit your grown asses down and COMMUNICATE. Ask her why she keeps bringing it up and what is her end goal in doing so.

Also regardless,  you can't expect her to read your mind that this particularly bothers you.", "Okay then slightly Y T A, it seems like you need to be more direct than you have been.

The longer something has been aged, the less likely it is to have lactose, but younger cheese absolutely had lactose. What this is getting wrong is that those cheeses may be lower lactose, but generally, they are not lactose free. Cheddar absolutely has lactose. Really old Cheddar might be fine, but in no way is all Cheddar low lactose or lactose free.\n\nAs someone with lactose issues, I'd be willing to bet that your wife keeps bringing it up because it makes you fart more or makes them smell worse.
