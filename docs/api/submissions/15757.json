Children from the town also come to the library during the day, to meet and read.\n\nSince the stairs to the second floor are open (no door or anything like that), children who are visiting the library have access to the second floor. \n\nI realize that children make sounds and they need to be allowed to exist. But they have started running all over the house. This presence of theirs has been disturbing our meetings and daily work of us who have offices on the second floor. The children talk loudly/scream, they walk in and out off our cafeteria and get them self's biscuits and other things that are bought for the staff on the floor. \n\nI didn't let this bother me until I came upon one child eating food brought by a colleague for his birthday to share with everyone and then walked in on another child looking in the cupboards for something to eat. These children are not from homes where there is a lack of food, and there was something to eat on the table if they had just been hungry. I know most of their families and how they are doing, they all get food in school over the day. So, they are just children walking around unsupervised in the house that happens to have a library, and then doing what children do - except it is starting to annoy me and my colleagues.\n\nNow, I don't have kids myself and that's okay. But when I contacted the school and asked that the parents be informed that the children were not allowed to be on the second floor of the building, I received a rather cold response from parents afterwards. They seem to think of me as some sort of \"The childless cruel woman who doesn't want children around her\" and let me know that I was making a big deal out of the situation. \n\nReally? \n\nLike, we may be in a difficult meeting, with sensitive people, and in the middle of discussing some awkward matters, need to excuse the shouting and yelling outside of the room because the kids are arguing about who will get cocoa from the office-coffee-machine next. To not be able to keep anything in the cafeteria and be sure that it wont be taken/eaten by some kid. To have to clean up when they are gone because they have spilled or left some cups around.\n\nSo, AITA for contacting the school and asking them to send an message (the best way to reach all at once) to parents about the situation?", "created_utc": 1682523059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zl4qt/aita_for_asking_parents_to_keep_their_kids_away/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The school sending the message to parents won\u2019t fix the issue.", "NTA, yall need to get a door for the second floor with special access. Children should not be allowed to roam free like that, it could be dangerous for them and they could get in sticky situations. In any office, I wouldn't want kids running around unsupervised. It's honestly rude they are allowed to just run around. Whoever is in charge of them needs to get a grip on them.", "NTA\n\nYour building gave permission for students at the school to visit the library, and has learned that no good deed goes unpunished.\n\nThe students were invited to visit the library. That doesn't give them license to roam around the rest of the building. And it certainly doesn't give them license to steal food that is meant for staff.\n\nIn addition to the above, there could be legal problems as well. I assume the students that wander away from the library aren't being supervised by staff from the school. What if they get hurt? What if they damage property? I'm not a lawyer, and I don't know how kid-safe the rest of your building is, but sounds like it could cause potential problems.\n\nIf the school wants to take their students to the library, they need to supervise them and make sure they stay in the library. This is a no-brainer.", "NTA - Why would people think it's okay to allow their children to run free in a place of business?\n\nI feel like the owners of the building should provide some kind of barrier. They are impeding your ability to do business.", "NTA - If you can, put a rope across the stairs with a sign saying that the upstairs office area and kitchen is private and not open to people who are there to use the library. Speak to the people who work in the library and ask them to remind people when they come in that the upstairs is not part of the library and is off limits.", "NTA. Children going unsupervised into areas of a building they shouldn't go is a big no-no. I am sorry, people that care for children are very quick to dump that responsibility on others.", "NTA, but unless a door gets put in, you will never stop it.  Add a door and lock it", "NTA and sad that people can't understand that someone can both not hate children and also want boundaries on their behavior. You're not being unreasonable wanting them to not eat other people's food or not disturb workers. Perhaps a better solution would be the building or library helping by using some kind of barrier on the stairs to make it known that upstairs is off limits to the kids?", "NTA, this is crazy. someone (you or your boss) needs to contact the library and tell them that they need to make it known that unsupervised children are not allowed upstairs, and you need to have some signage to that effect on the second floor as well. \n\ni'm surprised the kids are allowed to even run around the library, honestly. i thought libraries were supposed to be quiet places to read.", "NTA. If I\u2019m understanding this correctly, there is a first floor where there are child appropriate activities, and second floor for business? It would be absolutely inappropriate for those kids to be on the second floor. And what kind of parent lets kids just run around into unsupervised areas where they are free to steal food?!? I honestly feel like I must be missing something because I can\u2019t wrap my head around why anyone would think it was okay for kids to be left to roam the building unsupervised. Did you tell them the kids were getting into food that didn\u2019t belong to them?", "NTA,  This children are not lacking in food or housing, what they are lacking is manors & proper parenting.  Is there a way you could lock up the lunchroom  maybe put a sign up that says do not enter this area.  As for the parents that think their kids are so special and they can do what ever they want, well... you cant fix stupid...", "NTA Put a baby gate at the bottom of the stairs and be done with the miscreants.", "NAH, but I think you\u2019re going about it the wrong way. If the downstairs is a place where kids can run around unsupervised (which kids need) then it will be hard for the parents to keep them from going up the stairs. And they\u2019d have to send this message over and over since there are always new kids and new parents. \n\nCan you get the building manager to place one of those chain link ropes across the stairs with a sign saying \u201cPrivate offices\u201d or something like that. This will discourage the kids from coming up and make it clear to parents that it\u2019s not an area where kids should be.", "NTA. If the 2nd floor is not supposed to be accessible to children, then they should not be allowed there. Parents need to be parents, and it may be time for some kind of a door to be placed at the entrance to the stairs. Beyond that, it's also a hazard to them if a child takes a tumble down the stairs or injures themself on office equipment (coffee maker, paper cutter, etc).", "How about putting a velvet rope across the stair access with a sign saying 'No Public Access'?", "NTA. Contact the landlord and tell them to fit a lockable door. Any business should have a way of locking and securing their offices.     \nSecondly, I'd start sending the school invoices for all the food eaten.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm gathering your floor isn't a part of the library and school and that you just happen to share a building.   \n\n\nThe school has a duty to keep those kids supervised and prevent them from leaving school authorized areas.
