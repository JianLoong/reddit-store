The plan was to take work off Friday, and spend Friday-Sunday at a cabin in the woods.\n\nThis past weekend, we sat down to make our travel plans for tomorrow (Friday). BF realized that, despite me reminding him 2-3 times to take Friday off, he forgot to take the day off from work. He had meetings until noon, which wasn\u2019t a huge deal since we could leave right when he was done and get to the cabin right at check-in time. \n\nYesterday, he nonchalantly told me that he had another meeting put on his calendar at 3pm, so we couldn\u2019t leave until after that. I\u2019ve already taken Friday off of work, and I was planning on leaving as early as possible to avoid traffic and driving through the woods at night. Since he didn\u2019t take the day off or block the afternoon, I told him we can just take two cars. I will leave during the day and he can meet me there when he\u2019s done working. \n\nThis, apparently, is unacceptable. He refuses to drive up by himself and the only way he will come is if we drive up together. I told him that was not an option unless he could move his 3pm meeting. Since he can\u2019t/won\u2019t move his afternoon meeting and won\u2019t drive to the cabin by himself, he has decided to stay home and I am going on the trip alone.

There is no reason you should wait for him. He is an adult and can find his way.", "NTA. Leave the dogs with BF and go enjoy a relaxing weekend alone. Just because he can't put on his big boy pants and figure out how to handle his schedule doesn't mean you should be penalized.

Wouldn't surprise me if BF has been planning to ditch your weekend away for a boys night whilst you are conveniently off the premises.

When you didn't cancel, he was all, \"Well, this just doesn't work for me!\"\n\nHe probably never wanted to go, he might even hate the woods.\n\nNTA.
