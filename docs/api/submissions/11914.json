She (tried to) used you and your brother in that capacity as you grew up, and she is still doing so today. I saw in one of your responses that your stepdad was emotionally abusive to you and your mother both enabled and participated in it. This is enough reason to cut her off. Tell your mother this: You have had enough of her trying to hurt your dad by using you and you have also had enough of her and her husband emotionally abusing you. It's time to let her go because of her treatment of you and that she nor her husband are to ever contact you again either directly or through third parties (i.e. other family members/friends/etc.). The one thing you need to do is to be ready to do a mass text, group chat, or even social media post(s) to get YOUR side out first. Have it ready to go so that the moment you have told your mother you are cutting her off and to never contact you again you send out the text/chat/post because otherwise your mother is going to get her narrative in and it will be \"poor me, look at what that horrible, no good daughter of mine has done\" and all those family members/friends/etc. are going to decend on you and blame you and harass you for your mother's sake.
