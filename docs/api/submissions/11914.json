Your mom should be prioritizing what you want since she's the parent and also it's your milestone.", "NTA, this is your graduation not your mothers what you want is the important part. Setting boundaries with your mom sounds well over due, and something you desperately need to do in order to have a healthy life balance going forward. Changing the dynamics between you and someone who has behaved, and still is, in an abusive manner for years towards you is not going to be easy.", "NTA. My parents also divorced, and they did it when I was pretty young. My mom and Dad HATED each other the majority of my life. Even just talking to my dad would set my mom off, and it got to the point where every single time I saw my dad it became a personal betrayal to my mom. (He didn\u2019t even cheat or do anything objectively bad, my mom is just Like That) \n\nI don\u2019t know your situation, but if the dynamic is similar than NTA. Your mom is making this about herself when it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about you, your family, and your accomplishment", "NTA. It is fair for both couples as your bio parents are both invited and the steps aren't. Honestly at this point your mom should figure out if she can suck it up and be near your dad for the duration of the ceremony and if not then you'll invite someone else instead. Sometimes you have to do things you don't like for your kids and as long as there was no abuse or anything from your dad it shouldn't be a problem (if there was that changes things) .", "You\u2019re not being disrespectful at all! You\u2019re respecting both parents actually, by inviting them instead of the other step-parent. If your mom continues like this, I would tell her to stay home with the stepdad if she can\u2019t stay away from him that long and you will invite your stepmom instead.\nEdit: forgot to add NTA", "NTA. For whatever reason your mother loathes your dad. She will do whatever she can to take out her anger and hatred on him and hurt him. She (tried to) used you and your brother in that capacity as you grew up, and she is still doing so today. I saw in one of your responses that your stepdad was emotionally abusive to you and your mother both enabled and participated in it. This is enough reason to cut her off. Tell your mother this: You have had enough of her trying to hurt your dad by using you and you have also had enough of her and her husband emotionally abusing you. It's time to let her go because of her treatment of you and that she nor her husband are to ever contact you again either directly or through third parties (i.e. other family members/friends/etc.). The one thing you need to do is to be ready to do a mass text, group chat, or even social media post(s) to get YOUR side out first. Have it ready to go so that the moment you have told your mother you are cutting her off and to never contact you again you send out the text/chat/post because otherwise your mother is going to get her narrative in and it will be \"poor me, look at what that horrible, no good daughter of mine has done\" and all those family members/friends/etc. are going to decend on you and blame you and harass you for your mother's sake. Make it clear to those people that any attempt to be a mouthpiece for your mother and berate you will result in them being blocked immediately.", "NTA, congratulations on standing your ground. Your Mom is a drama queen and I can feel low contact in your future.", "NTA.  Your mother seems way too entitled and vindictive.  I would take any slight opportunity to disinvite her as well and invite the stepmom.  Whoa!  I'd like to see that drama play out.  Good luck and congratulations on your accomplishment!", "NTA, it sounds like your mom participated in actively trying to alienate you from your dad growing up. Maybe if she's going to act this way, you should bring your step mom instead.\n\nEven if she DOES come, you still have to consider what the odds are that she doesn't start something or cause a scene. What's the possibility she ruins this moment for you anyway?", "NTA, rescind mom's invitation and invite your step mom.", "Coming from the mother\u2019s perspective, I would MUCH (much much) rather spend time with my current husband than the former one. But if this is what makes my daughter happy, then I would do it. It\u2019s a big deal for her and I wouldn\u2019t miss it. NTA.", "NTA. You have limited tickets and picked the most important people in your life. Tell her She gets with the program and comes alone, or your step mom can come instead.", "NTA. \n\nIt is YOUR graduation. Not hers. With limited invitations, you have to prioritize. \n\nShe\u2019s making this about HER. She\u2019s a grown woman and can\u2019t be away from her husband for a day?  Can\u2019t drive in the dark?  Seriously?\n\nI\u2019d have handled it the exact same way as you did.", "NTA - You decide who to invite. It\u2019s your event.\n\nAnd, she can\u2019t be away from her husband for a few hours? That seems codependent. It sounds like she was never on-board for healthy co-parenting and she still can\u2019t be bothered to try this many years later.", "NTA your moms a dick", "NTA- tell her to try and get an extra ticket from the college but you are not responding to her temper tantrum", "NTA. It\u2019s your graduation.  You choose.  She can choose not to come.  Enjoy your day that you earned.", "NTA, your mom sounds very selfish and manipulative! Maybe it's time you start distancing yourself and your family from her. For your own sanity!", "NTA but mom is for insisting on stepdad. Congratulations on graduating, OP!", "NTA. This is your decision to make, and your mom should not be making efforts to exclude your dad from your life. \n\n~~You didn\u2019t say this, but reading between the lines your mom (and perhaps stepdad) took greater responsibility for you growing up than your bio dad did.~~\n\n~~I\u2019m going to say NAH because this is your choice to make, yet I also get strong vibes that you mom deserves prioritization. Only you would know.~~", "\"I hope you'll be able to attend my graduation, but if not then maybe we can get together soon.\"\n\nThe end. If she truly, actually, seriously believes you're going to uninvite your father in place of her husband she is delusional and not worth wasting your breath trying to reason with. Also, he could drive her there and chill and get a coffee or something. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou invite who you want. She can decline if she doesn't like the terms.  She doesn't get to dictate your guest list.", "Based on the information you've provided, I would say that you are not the asshole NTA in this situation. You have every right to invite the guests of your choice to your own graduation, and it's understandable that you would prioritize your actual parent over your stepdad.\r Your mother's behavior, on the other hand, seems manipulative and selfish. She is trying to guilt-trip you into excluding your father, who clearly means a lot to you. It's also concerning that she has a history of trying to ruin your relationship with your dad.\r You made it clear to your mother that you would not be swayed in your decision, and that it was up to her whether or not she attended your graduation. It's not your responsibility to cater to her demands or accommodate her travel preferences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He had my brother & i every other weekend growing up. He also paid above & beyond for child support.  Deep down I strongly resent my mom for how she tried to keep my dad away because she wanted my stepdad to be our dad. I have always struggled to get along with my stepdad as he was incredibly emotionally abusive & my mother allowed/ participated in it. Im having a hard time figuring out if this is my mom manipulating me or if i was actually to harsh with her.", "This is why you need to break away from her.  For your own health, which may spillover to your husband and child.  While my response may seem flippant, it is meant truthfully and sincerely.
