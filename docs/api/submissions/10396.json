I had a miscarriage and got pregnant again right away without trying. The only reason I was going to wait was to give my body a chance to recover. The miscarriage baby was intentional and I intended a year later to start trying again. It\u2019s not bad things to admit to as long as the children feel loved.

Get away now.", "It doesn\u2019t matter who gave you the name.  It\u2019s yours now.  It\u2019s who you are.  Only you have the the right to decide to change it.  You\u2019re a person, not a possession.", "So... This is something I didn't get, because my folks were and are married to each other, and it's something my friend whose mom was always single didn't get either, which is why I'm passing it along. It took my SiL, whose birth parents were divorced and both remarried, to teach it to me:\n\n'Parent' is a role, not a generic relationship, and 'Mom' and 'Dad' are the titles EARNED through performing those roles. You don't have a Dad... Yet. You have a male genetic progenitor, or a GD (genetic donor) as my SiL calls here. YOU get to decide if he's going to get the chance to be a 'Dad', not him.\n\nHe thinks he's your Dad... And that you can be controlled and ordered the way he has controlled and ordered the children he has with his spouse. He can't. You don't have that relationship, and you're NEVER GOING TO. You can't. That chance is gone. It's not your fault, or his fault... And honestly, it's not really your Mom's either - she made the best calls she could with what she had. \n\nSo... What do you WANT from him? I'd argue that basic respect would be a good place to start, and he's failing that, hard. If you have access to one, might I suggest a couple conversations with a therapist/councillor/religious leader/mentor/etc? Something to help you figure out what YOU want from the relationship and let you set some ground rules.\n\nAnd, because I'm petty, I'd start calling him the most obnoxious name you can think of... And when he gets mad, which he will, tell him that's what you always imagined you dad's name would be\ud83e\udd23", "Exactly this.  You said it perfectly.  He wants you to be some fantasy daughter.  OP, he either gets to know and accepts the amazing woman you are, or he doesn\u2019t get a daughter.  You are YOU, not some image in his mind."]}
