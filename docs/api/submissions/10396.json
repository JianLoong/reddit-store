He didn\u2018t know I existed but agreed to a DNA test and when it came back positive he was very happy.

This has been going on for about 2 months like this. \n\nHowever, about 2 weeks in he told me that he always wanted a girl, that they only had a third kid cause he wanted a last try and that he had picked out a name when he himself was in college, which apparently was his grandmothers middle name, she basically raised him. He said that he was really happy to learn he had a girl and asked me if I would be okay with him calling me \u201eJasmine\u201c instead of \u201eStephanie\u201c, which is my name. It was akward and I didn\u2018t really know how to react so I just kinda said I wouldnt be comfortable with that because I like my name and well its my name. He was really disappointed and I felt bad. A couple days later he started calling me Jasmine, and when I remebered him that I don\u2018t really like that, he said that I would get used to it and that he knows this is the perfect name for me and that I should be happy about him being so involved cause a lot of kids dont get that I should be grateful for all he does for me. \n\nI feel like first of all I am an adult and fully support myself, I have my own apartment, job and go to college without asking him to pay for anything so its not like he does unusual stuff, I appreciate him being in my life and spending time with and I am very grateful but I just dont wanna loose my name. I offered to add \u201eJasmine\u201c as a middle name but he didnt want that, he wants me to change it and only go by that one. \n\nWIBTA if I told him again that I will not change the name and dont want him calling me that, even if it hurts him?

I don't have enough info to make a firm judgement here, but you didn't know him for 19 years - there's a reason for that, and (maybe) it's because of who he is. You later mention you self-support yourself - what is there to be 'grateful' for? What a jackass thing for him to say. He doesn't know you (two months is not a lot of time) and you know you.

No. He didn't and it doesn't matter that he didn't know you existed, the fact remains that he was never a father figure to you.

He can use that time to pull his head out of whatever place it is, and deal with what is going on.  \nYes, this must have been a shock and he has internal stuff to sort. Sure.

Honestly it doesn't matter that your mom simply didn't want to deal with the drama of finding out who your actual dad was because the universe was still like, nah this ain't it. \n\nYou owe him nothing. I mean look at what you wrote. That isn't normal behavior. He doesn't get to try and remake you into the daughter he's always dreamed of having. First its your name. Then its your major and job. Choice of partners. How you dress and so on \n\nIf it was me I'd just bail and bail hard because my gut says this can only end badly. I know you want a dad OP but no dad is worth this shit. \n\nI won't even make the usual therapy suggestion because dude isn't even trying. He's legit trying to manipulate you because what he wants is more important.", "NTA Also Stephanie is a nicer name than Jasmine, for me anyway.", "NTA and this is going to be hard to hear.

He either accepts you for you or you don\u2019t need him in your life. Because darling after two months of someone being in your life, they have absolutely no say in something so fundamentally you.", "NTA - what?!", "NTA", "NTA. He can't just write over who you are to be the \"daughter he always wanted\". Don't let him call you that and if he doesn't stop then it might be time to reevaluate his presence in your life.", "NYA he doesn\u2019t see you. He\u2019s trying to remove your identity. Big red flag. Big big red flag.", "This. I would personally cut this man out of my life if he continued with this. It's weird and controlling and you don't have to put up with it.", "He sounds like a control freak. You really want to engage? Your life is good right now. Slow down. Stand your ground. Do not allow him to disrespect your mother.", "Soo he wants you to stick to his fantasy because you owe him, and he's badmouthing your Mum when everyone agree that it wasn't that serious, so who knows what his reaction might have been. You sound mature and grounded, you are your own person not his fantasy kid. This, After only two months is a bit concerning."]}
