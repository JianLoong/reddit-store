His fianc\u00e9 smokes nicotine vapes.  \n\n\nSo recently my daughter (6) was talking about her dad\u2019s (30) house and she casually mentioned his fianc\u00e9 (26) vapes in the car and house while my daughter is over there. She also told me that her dad smokes \u201chomemade cigarettes\u201d in the car at night, and it smells bad the next day when she\u2019s in the car. I (27) obviously know that he\u2019s actually smoking weed not cigs. \n\nThis evening I mentioned it to him on the phone after my daughter had her phone call with him, and he immediately got defensive. He kept saying \u201cshe doesn\u2019t do that\u201d and was starting to get angry with me. He completely dismissed my question and cut me off telling me what time he\u2019d be here to pick her up tomorrow. \n\nI used to smoke cigarettes and vaped, but I\u2019ve quit and it\u2019s been about a year. Never did I smoke in the car or cape with my child present. Also, I don\u2019t have a problem with weed I just feel weird my daughter knowing about it? \n\nIdk. AITA for asking them to maybe not smoke around her?", "created_utc": 1698971315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mib8i/aita_for_asking_my_daughters_father_to_ask_his/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA\n\nYour daughter has just inadvertently told you he\u2019s smoking weed whilst operating a car\u2026..You\u2019d never forgive yourself if something happened to her so I\u2019d be going back to court and letting the custody court know about that piece of information \n\nThe fact he got so dismissive and defensive worries me he will now take it out on her the innocent child", "NTA. It's pretty common knowledge these days that second hand smoke (AND vape) affect bystanders too, especially kids. I think that's a very reasonable line to draw. I don't know if you can do much about the weed he smokes away from her, but it seems reasonable to ask him to keep it hidden.", "Nta.  He just shouldn\u2019t smoke around kids like that.   This isn\u2019t the 50s", "NTA - People that smoke or vape in a house or car with kids are selfish pigs, and usually just trashy people. (I vape and smoke the green stuff too, but there\u2019s a time and a place.)", "NTA vapes are disgusting only second to actual cigarettes. Your daughters safety is paramount.", "NTA every smoker/vaper I\u2019ve seen has no sense of wtf goes on around them it\u2019s crazy", "Not only are you NTA, I would petition to take away his visitation rights", "In some states it's illegal to smoke or vape in a car with a minor.", "NTA. Is he smoking weed while driving? Call cps if so. \n\nYou can only request the vaping to stop. It's not causing your daughter harm. It it is reinforcing bad behavior. They have no obligation to stop as it's going\nNot a health concern.", "Is she in the car when the GF is vaping? Because you've said your ex doesn't drive... so is the GF driving and vaping with your daughter?\n\nOr do they both go to the car to smoke or vape, so they aren't doing it in the house? Your post is confusing.", "You can have the court modify your custody agreement to state that no one is to vape or smoke while in vehicles with your child or in their living space. It's hard to enforce, but enough times breaking the rules and he can lose custody time.", "If this is true I would go to the courts and have his parental time with his daughter be supervised visits this way he has to be monitored the whole time he is with her.", "YTA\n\nYou asked if you're the AH for asking the new GF not to vape around the daughter.\n\nBut you didn't even mention to him about smoking weed around her.\n\nYou just don't like the new GF.  \n\nShould he and she smoke and vape around the kid?  No.\n\nShould you reel in your hatred of the new GF?  Yes.", "NTA you're trying to protect your child and you have every right to ask him these questions. Respiratory diseases from secondhand smoke is a real thing. I'd get your daughter checked out by a doctor and relay your concerns to make sure shes ok and so that they document what happened. It may come in handy later on if you need to adjust your custody arrangement.", "NTA if you go ahead and ask and then let it go. But just a small  parenting tip if you want to have a good relationship for your daughter and her father. As much as possible try try try to not let what goes on at his house get to you. Kids are very good pot stirrers (which I am sure she isn't yet). When kids come with the report of 'at daddy's house' they also give reports 'at mommy's house', and it just fosters bad feelings and arguments with this person you have to know the rest of your life. No matter what you got to know this guy forever. When my kids bring up something from their other parents house (even if i thought it is ridiculous), I just say 'oh geeze' and try to turn it back to the positive and then let the crap go. Time at dad's is dad's and ain't none of my business.", "NTA. Time to take him back for a new custody arrangements. Supervised visits.", "NTA and you are being generous with him. My mom took my dad to court so many times because he smelled of cigarettes. He never smoked around us nor were we aware until a certain age. The court would side with my mom and my dad would have to do all these steps before picking us up so he wouldn\u2019t smell and neither would we.", "\\*I'm not a smoker\\*  but I suspect that it's illegal here in Australia too to smoke / vap in cars with kids.", "In MN, USA it is now too", "From what I understand she's not in the car with him, he just goes out smokes a joint or two or whatever in the car instead of completely unsheltered outside in whatever weather there is. She smells it the next morning when they use the car, no one is intoxicated while driving.", "He\u2019s not smoking and driving. He doesn\u2019t drive nor can he legally because he isn\u2019t a licensed driver. I\u2019m already worried enough when she goes over there just with my own anxieties.", "This. I would be concerned to let him have her unsupervised. Vaping weed and driving is dangerous.", "I agree with you, I don't think I could have said it better.", "Can we add third hand smoke.  It's not good touching stuff with that gawd awful brown sludge and having it all through your clothes too.", "What a stupid fuck comment. \n\nI smoked for 20yrs before I finally managed to quit.  I always knew what was going on around me at all times. Just because someone has an addiction doesn't mean they're stupid.", "He\u2019s not smoking weed and driving. He can\u2019t drive, and doesn\u2019t have a license. He smokes at night before dinner/bed.", "I think the girlfriend is vaping nicotine, not THC, pretty sure OP says that.", "I never said I hated her? I do like her and never have had an issue with her other vaping e cigarettes around my daughter. I\u2019ve asked him not to smoke weed around her more times than I can count.", "Sure is. Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2008. Vapes added in 2015.", "Also illegal in New Zealand", "So, he\u2019s hotboxing?  There is absolutely no reason for your kid to even know he\u2019s doing that, unless he\u2019s doing it while she\u2019s still awake and she came out to the car looking for him.\n\nI have no issue with cannabis, but I\u2019m a firm believer that when you\u2019re the lone legal parent in the home (like he is when your daughter\u2019s there), you stay sober in case there\u2019s an emergency.  It\u2019s not like he can\u2019t green out all he wants when she\u2019s not there.  NTA", "Then if you don\u2019t think she\u2019s going into a safe environment be her advocate and change the custody agreement", "Just because he doesn't have a license doesn't mean he's not driving.", "He could be driving ILLEGALLY. You need to go to the courts NOW.", "notice how I said \u201cI\u2019ve seen\u201d and never mentioned addicts. Y\u2019all get offended just to get offended keep crying", "Huh? You said he's smoking cannabis in the car at night, making it stink.\nRegardless, your daughters lungs shouldn't be subjected to second hand smoke, it doesn't matter if it is smoked or vapped, tobacco or cannabis. \nThere are a lot of edibles options out there, has he considered that option?", "Yep. They're just trashy. Nothing you can do about that.", "I didnt ask about what she was vaping, I asked where she vapes. I didnt even mention substances", "Technically by him doing it outside in the car he isn't smoking it around her. He just needs to air it out better. Also is it possible the girlfriend is vaping an Ayr vape? They're non-nicotine, they are supposed to be like aromatherapy kinda.", "Are vapes illegal here too?  Or is that my imagination?", "And so it should be.", "He's going out to sit in the car and smoke rather than the house. You can sit in a car without driving it.", "FYI about 10% of the population doesn't have the liver enzyme to metabolize THC edibles, they're almost completely ineffective for us. There are some newer types of edibles that use NanoTHC that bypass that enzyme but they are very expensive and not widely available. So no, not everyone can consume edibles instead.", "They\u2019re supposed to be prescription only for nicotine use but non-nicotine are legal. It\u2019s probably a shitshow trying to regulate vapes right now.", "Oh, ok.  I had the idea in my head that they were all illegal.  Youngest kid said you couldn't walk into the high school toilets without feeling sick from the smell of fake strawberries and <insert whatever flavours are used that day>."]}
