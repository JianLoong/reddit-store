His fianc\u00e9 smokes nicotine vapes.  \n\n\nSo recently my daughter (6) was talking about her dad\u2019s (30) house and she casually mentioned his fianc\u00e9 (26) vapes in the car and house while my daughter is over there. She also told me that her dad smokes \u201chomemade cigarettes\u201d in the car at night, and it smells bad the next day when she\u2019s in the car. I (27) obviously know that he\u2019s actually smoking weed not cigs. \n\nThis evening I mentioned it to him on the phone after my daughter had her phone call with him, and he immediately got defensive. He kept saying \u201cshe doesn\u2019t do that\u201d and was starting to get angry with me. He completely dismissed my question and cut me off telling me what time he\u2019d be here to pick her up tomorrow. \n\nI used to smoke cigarettes and vaped, but I\u2019ve quit and it\u2019s been about a year. Never did I smoke in the car or cape with my child present. Also, I don\u2019t have a problem with weed I just feel weird my daughter knowing about it? \n\nIdk.

It's pretty common knowledge these days that second hand smoke (AND vape) affect bystanders too, especially kids. I think that's a very reasonable line to draw. I don't know if you can do much about the weed he smokes away from her, but it seems reasonable to ask him to keep it hidden.", "Nta.  He just shouldn\u2019t smoke around kids like that.   This isn\u2019t the 50s", "NTA - People that smoke or vape in a house or car with kids are selfish pigs, and usually just trashy people.

But just a small  parenting tip if you want to have a good relationship for your daughter and her father. As much as possible try try try to not let what goes on at his house get to you. Kids are very good pot stirrers (which I am sure she isn't yet). When kids come with the report of 'at daddy's house' they also give reports 'at mommy's house', and it just fosters bad feelings and arguments with this person you have to know the rest of your life. No matter what you got to know this guy forever.

My mom took my dad to court so many times because he smelled of cigarettes. He never smoked around us nor were we aware until a certain age.

It\u2019s probably a shitshow trying to regulate vapes right now.", "Oh, ok.  I had the idea in my head that they were all illegal.  Youngest kid said you couldn't walk into the high school toilets without feeling sick from the smell of fake strawberries and <insert whatever flavours are used that day>.", "NTA, it's a safety issue. Even if they weren't driving under the influence and risking her safety vaping around a child is bad for the child's health and could possibly influence the child to vape when they're older. I don't really care about weed around consenting adults, but weed around kids no way. If your child goes to school reeking of weed after they hotbox the car the teachers would be fair to call child protective services,", "NTA- Second hand smoke can kill.  They ARE damaging her little lungs by doing it in her presence. I know someone who just had a CPS case brought against them for vaping in front of the child (Not in USA).  You have Every Right to insist they not do those things around her. If they can't stop, well then you know what is more important to them than your Daughter and her health.", "NTA.

We can afford private school, my husband and I are very empathetic. He is rather brilliant. We can afford to take care of a child. And yet, I still don't think we would be good enough. My friend agrees! She said we could \"babysit\" when they went out of town when he is a teenager. \n\nYour husband smokes weed in front of his young kid? The gf vapes in front her. Vaping isn't really any better than smoking. It's the same except that it is much more annoying. However I believe it is just vapor. Don't quote me on it.\n\nAre you the asshole by by asking your ex to not smoke psychedelic drugs around your young daughter? Seriously? Weed is a Hallucinogen. It can cause you to hallucinate. I'd take him to court and get full custody.", "Nta- my brother and sil are strict on me when it comes to hitting my puff. I can\u2019t do it inside at all and if I\u2019m outside and my niece is I don\u2019t do it bc she doesn\u2019t need to be around that. It\u2019s not that hard to refrain while the child is not there. Does it suck and are you feening hard for it? Sure but that\u2019s the sacrifice you make when a child is in your care/vicinity", "NTA but I hope you push this even further!

Illegal in my country.\n\nThat also being said\u2026\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your ex can drive or has access to his own car, a little clarification might help with my understanding. If this is your ex\u2019s gfs car, and she\u2019s the one who drives/vapes when she drives, then you may have to resume all responsibilities for pick ups and drop offs, especially if you take it to the courts like some are suggesting. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s in the right in regards to vaping in front of a kid, but where it is her car and she may see driving your daughter places as now more restrictive or even a legal liability, and choose the option to not drive with her at all period. Just something you may have to fully commit to before taking any legal/custody actions.", "And not to forget vaping and smoking in general are really bad for someone\u2019s health. OP, your daughter is exposed to second and third hand smoking. There are a lot of researches about this. Second hand is when your daughter is next to them. Third hand is when they smoke somewhere else and then take the stuff on their hands and in their clothes to your child. This is dangerous to your daughter\u2019s health as well.", "NTA\nEven if vaping is less dangerous than regular second hand smoking, your child is still exposed to nicotine and depending on the e-liquid used, other bad chemicals too. \nIf he doesn't drive the only problem with weed smoking is the odor in that case, he could smoke anywhere else than in the car tho...", "I wholeheartedly agree.", "Vapes smell so bad and its suffocating in the car if someone keeps vaping.

Someone would have to be sucking the vape straight out of my mouth to get second hand vape, it dissipates within seconds even inside buildings with no wind.", "See, no one knows yet whether vaping and smoking is the same or if one's worse because vaping is so new", "Is this a reply and verdict here, or just a pat on the back, can\u2019t really tell??\n\nAlso I don\u2019t know what kind of alien hybrid weed you\u2019re smoking on my friend, but if you are hallucinating it\u2019s time to put the bong down, and rethink your supply source because someone has fucked with your weed, or you can\u2019t handle your shit and your the problem so put the bong down forever.", "Lol weed is not a hallucinogen.", "It's the same here in the UK, you also can't smoke in a work vehicle, even if you own the vehicle, if you're passengers are co-workers and on the clock it's a no no.\nAlthough, when it comes to vaping, the rules are very different.  In schools it's up to the individual school if the staff can vape in the staff room, people vape in clubs, pubs, on buses and trains all the time.\nNgl, it grates on me as I'm a smoker, but I'll wait on the underground when a train is delayed and go out in the rain and have a friend attend my drink when out.\n\nI don't see the difference in smoking/vaping.

Weed smoke \"soaks\" into the fabric and the kid can smell traces of it the next morning.", "While that is certainly true, he is probably in there smoking so he is not in the house smoking", "Yes, exactly. Also, he doesn't seem super responsible so why would we assume he isn't driving?", "It\u2019s pretty clear that he is going to the car at night while it\u2019s parked to smoke weed not in the house. OP is def NTA but chill out on that avenue, the kid smells it the next morning. Vaping with a child IN the car however is not even legal in some states.", "I notice you said\n\nEVERY SMOKER/VAPER\n\nSo pretending you're actually this stupid", "Bruh its called reading comprehension. The girlfriend vapes in front of the kid, so probably in the car while she's driving. The father hotboxes alone in the car at night and then the next morning the kid smells it", "The law does address vaping tho????", "You'd prefer that he smokes in the house? Or that parents can't smoke weed? Should parents also abstain from any alcohol?", "Because assuming that he's driving without a license when he's never had one is a fucking hop, skip and *huge* jump to a conclusion. \n\n\nDudes smoking weed in the car presumably so he isn't in the house while his daughter is over and got defensive about an accusation involving his current partner made by his former partner, the defensiveness is a bit shit but also extremely common in this situation.\n\n\nEdit: yeesh, I read some of OPs other comments.
