I told my SIL I was going to give niece the money for the trip, and then I would drop it. I told my niece the same thing: I'd give her the money, and let her make her own decisions. \n\nA few months later, my niece came to me and said she was taking the trip after a lot of consideration. She told her mom, and it didn't go well. Unfortunately, it caused a huge fight between them, and my niece didn't talk to her mom for over two months. During that time, my SIL bombarded me with accusations of taking her daughter away. Eventually, I blocked her on my phone, so the only way she could talk to me was through my husband (her brother). My husband took my side, but tried to soothe my SIL, telling her she raised a mature and capable person, and she had to let go or lose her daughter forever. \n\nDuring that time, my niece was planning her trip, but also really missed her mom. She called me crying a lot, but never backed down on taking the trip. It was her mom that finally cracked, and after months of not talking, she reached out to niece and apologized. Things improved a little bit, but SIL was still against the trip. My niece told her it didn't matter, she was going and that was that. \n\nNiece and her friends did go on their trip and just got back last week. They had tons of fun. The only problems they had were one flat tire, and a bad sunburn on their first beach day. They ended up at Disneyland, and spent a few days just having the time of their lives.\n\nNiece was nice enough to call her mom daily, and provide updates, to help her mom not flip out too bad. SIL wasn't happy about her going, but admitted niece would have put her foot down at some point and the trip was a good excuse. She's still not happy with me, but she did thank me for always loving her daughter, even if we have vastly different ways of showing it. Niece is still negotiating how to have a better relationship with SIL. \n\nSo, yeah, niece had fun, and is working on her relationship with SIL.", "created_utc": 1689696393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1532k9c/wibta_for_sending_my_niece_on_a_roadtrip_update/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Awesome update, so glad your niece set her first boundary with her mom and went on the trip.  Also glad your SIL was willing to make the first move at reconnecting with her daughter.\n\nYou are an awesome Auntie and know you are in your Niece's corner when it comes to her setting future boundaries with her mom.", "I'm glad your niece ended up going on the trip. Honestly how long does your SIL think she can keep treating her daughter like she's 7 years old? And where is your brother in all this?", "Thanks for the update, glad your Niece had a blast :)", "It sounds like your niece has a strong and loyal support system in every direction and she's very lucky to have you all. As is your sister in law .", "I'm very proud of her, I know how hard it was to stand up to her mom. And I think it'll be good for my SIL to see that her daughter can be an adult and make good decisions.", "Wonderful! Glad your niece has fun.  Too bad that stick up SIL's backside can't take a (permanent) vacation. The comment that Niece is negotiating how to have a better relationship with her mom made me sad. Her mom should be reaching out to her.", "That\u2019s a great update. Glad SIL is reaching out to mend their relationship but at the same time thanking you for loving her daughter. That takes a lot to admit and I\u2019m glad she recognizes it as love and not some malicious act. Hopefully smoother sailing going forward.", "My SIL is my husband's sister. He had a lot of talks with her when niece wasn't talking to her. I don't know how SIL thought she could keep a hold on her daughter for much longer. Niece hasn't lived with her in over a year.", "I might have created a monster. She has her next two road trips planned out."]}
