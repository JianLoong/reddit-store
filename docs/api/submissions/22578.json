I told my SIL I was going to give niece the money for the trip, and then I would drop it. I told my niece the same thing: I'd give her the money, and let her make her own decisions. \n\nA few months later, my niece came to me and said she was taking the trip after a lot of consideration. She told her mom, and it didn't go well. Unfortunately, it caused a huge fight between them, and my niece didn't talk to her mom for over two months. During that time, my SIL bombarded me with accusations of taking her daughter away. Eventually, I blocked her on my phone, so the only way she could talk to me was through my husband (her brother). My husband took my side, but tried to soothe my SIL, telling her she raised a mature and capable person, and she had to let go or lose her daughter forever. \n\nDuring that time, my niece was planning her trip, but also really missed her mom. She called me crying a lot, but never backed down on taking the trip. It was her mom that finally cracked, and after months of not talking, she reached out to niece and apologized. Things improved a little bit, but SIL was still against the trip. My niece told her it didn't matter, she was going and that was that. \n\nNiece and her friends did go on their trip and just got back last week. They had tons of fun. The only problems they had were one flat tire, and a bad sunburn on their first beach day. They ended up at Disneyland, and spent a few days just having the time of their lives.\n\nNiece was nice enough to call her mom daily, and provide updates, to help her mom not flip out too bad. SIL wasn't happy about her going, but admitted niece would have put her foot down at some point and the trip was a good excuse. She's still not happy with me, but she did thank me for always loving her daughter, even if we have vastly different ways of showing it. Niece is still negotiating how to have a better relationship with SIL. \n\nSo, yeah, niece had fun, and is working on her relationship with SIL.", "created_utc": 1689696393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1532k9c/wibta_for_sending_my_niece_on_a_roadtrip_update/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Awesome update, so glad your niece set her first boundary with her mom and went on the trip.  Also glad your SIL was willing to make the first move at reconnecting with her daughter.\n\nYou are an awesome Auntie and know you are in your Niece's corner when it comes to her setting future boundaries with her mom.", "I'm glad your niece ended up going on the trip. Honestly how long does your SIL think she can keep treating her daughter like she's 7 years old? And where is your brother in all this?", "Thanks for the update, glad your Niece had a blast :)", "It sounds like your niece has a strong and loyal support system in every direction and she's very lucky to have you all. As is your sister in law .", "I'm very proud of her, I know how hard it was to stand up to her mom. And I think it'll be good for my SIL to see that her daughter can be an adult and make good decisions.", "Wonderful! Glad your niece has fun.  Too bad that stick up SIL's backside can't take a (permanent) vacation. The comment that Niece is negotiating how to have a better relationship with her mom made me sad. Her mom should be reaching out to her.", "That\u2019s a great update. Glad SIL is reaching out to mend their relationship but at the same time thanking you for loving her daughter. That takes a lot to admit and I\u2019m glad she recognizes it as love and not some malicious act. Hopefully smoother sailing going forward.", "My SIL is my husband's sister. He had a lot of talks with her when niece wasn't talking to her. I don't know how SIL thought she could keep a hold on her daughter for much longer. Niece hasn't lived with her in over a year.", "I might have created a monster. She has her next two road trips planned out.", "Despite the problems, seems like SIL is willing to make compromises and even thanked you. \n\nShe\u2019s changing it seems so that\u2019s nice. I hope negotiations work out", "As someone who had an extremely overprotective, overbearing, controlling mom, THANK YOU for providing a space for your niece to start setting boundaries. Being suffocated and denied experiences by your parent sucks. You're a good aunt.", "I\u2019m so glad things have more or less worked out and your niece got to have an amazing roadtrip with her friends!! idk why your SIL is the way she is, but she must have gone through a lot if she struggles with such severe anxiety>control problems. It must be exhausting to be her.", "Sounds like apron strings irrevocably untied. Thank heavens.", "Good for her! I'm an adventuress myself :)", "This is the best reply! I hope SIL is able to get past her fears and maybe even help your niece with the itineraries!", "So glad it worked out for your niece :)  I hope, given time, your SIL will come round and realise she has to let go or maybe risk losing her daughter for good.\n\nI have heard of high school graduates here taking a year off and doing the \"hippie\" trail up the coast - I think they treat it like a working holiday, although I don't know if covid put a dampener on it.  Heck, our own Kylie Minogue mentioned many moons ago that a lot of her friends were doing that and having the time of their lives.  I remember she said she wished she had, but had started Neighbours by then.\n\nI wish your niece many, many happy and safe travels :)", "That's good. It's better that your niece learns to stick up for herself sooner than later. \n\nMy wife's mother was the same way, and shit can get way worse. My MIL used to act like my wife was dead, like literally telling people she lost a daughter, when we decided to move a few states away for a job.\n\nLuckily my wife had an awesome Aunt to stick up for her when we weren't around. So keep being an awesome Aunt", "I\u2019m so glad she went! My husband and I bought his son a plane ticket to Copenhagen (from CA) & a Eurail pass when he graduated from HS.  In contrast, his mother wouldn\u2019t let him take a city bus alone.  He went, had a blast, had to figure stuff out for himself, make his own decisions - 8 years later he still says it was a defining moment in his life.", "very happy to hear the updates.\n\nI am glad things are working out.\n\nCongrats to the beach for  her degree", "YTA ESH", "Yeah, I'm so proud of my niece. I know how hard it is to start the process of making space for yourself, and holding to those boundaries. And I think she managed to do it without having to drop her mom from her life.", "She genuinely loves my niece more than anything, and while she's hard headed, she gets there eventually.", "She has had a lot of trauma, and also suffers from PTSD, OCD, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and has some chronic health problems. Niece is her entire life, and she lives her own life so wound up and scared. I've offered to pay for therapy, and she's always turned me down. I'm hoping my niece can get her to change her mind. \n\nShe's a lovely person. She's just been dealt a shit hand in life, and struggles to cope.", "I think she is learning that. Especially since my niece had a great time, had no major issues, and came home so happy. \n\nMy parents gave my siblings and I roadtrips or trips on our own for graduations. After high school, I drove from Arizona to Florida and back, way before internet and cell phones were a thing. Had so much fun. My brother and his buddies took 2 months and hiked part of the PCT. Really gave me a sense of adventure and independence. I'm so glad my niece took the same opportunity.", "I'm so glad yiur wife was able to leave that situation! It's definitely not easy to stand up to your mom.", "You might suggest to niece that she take a one-on-one road trip with her mom.  Sounds like her mom has never actually been on one, and it might help them through this rough patch.", "I hope the next step is not calling her mom every day in order to help manage her mom's anxiety.", "You know, that's a great idea. I doubt I'd ever get my SIL to do it, but who knows. Maybe even just a short trip. I'll tell my niece and see what she says!", "it's better it happen sooner rather than later. your niece needs to be able to live her own life.", "\n\n>Niece hasn't lived with her in over a year.\n\n...what? I assumed niece still lived at home with how she was going off, but this is insane. it sounds like sil and niece had a toxic relationship if your niece was really that upset and conflicted about taking this trip without her mom's approval. your sil sounds like she needs series therapy", "I\u2019m wishing her (and you and your niece!) the best <3 it sounds like she has been through a lot, I hope it gets better for her.", "I feel bad for your sister in law. I just went to Disneyland with my 20 year old daughter. Just her and I, it was great. She is shortchanging herself as adult children are really fun. \n\nI\u2019m hoping she sees the joy her daughter feels and wants some of her own.", "Thank you for helping your niece break free and become a strong independent woman.", "Glad the umbilical cord was finally cut", "Nice update, I am a bit disappointed that you didn\u2019t tell us more about the flat tire", "You're a brilliant Aunt!  I'm glad your niece had an absolute blast.", "I'm disapointeed in you OP. You call your SIL a good mom in the last post. She doesn't llok like a good mom at all. And you are all enabling her.", "Maybe it's because you keep calling her a \"good mom\""]}
