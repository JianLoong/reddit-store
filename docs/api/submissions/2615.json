Maybe she did have to work through a lot to get to the better relationship you have now. But if it\u2019s actually libellous, shut it down.", "How much does your cousin's account vary from reality? Are you sure you haven't minimised things in your own mind to better live with the event?\n\nIt's possible that the truth is somewhere between your two versions.\n\nI appreciate that you feel you paid your consequences and it should not be brought up again, but life doesn't have a delete function. It sounds as though you concede you actually did something of consequence that affected her and now want to the right to tell her how much she is entitled to feel affected by that.\n\nHave you tried going to her and asking to discuss things? It might turn out that she never has been as 'over' this event as you think she ought to be.\n\nIt is better protection for your sons to be frank about what happened/you did and explain the circumstances, rather than hope they don't find out about something you are clearly ashamed of.", "What exactly was embellished though, are you saying the the event was embellished or her trauma?", "I work in publishing and agree with the above comment.\n\nLawyer up. All it takes is for her to name you on social media flippantly and you've been identified, and some of the online fan bases are, uh, intense.", "Lawyer lawyer lawyer lawyer lawyer!\n\nIf you are identifiable enough that someone told you that you are in the book, then your cousin and the publisher has committed libel, and you are likely entitled to monetary compensation and possibly a public retraction.  Your cousin is benefitting from a harmful lie and must be stopped.  NTA", "Sue her and the publisher for libel. Sounds like you have a good case.", "Lawyer up and if that doesn\u2019t work, publish receipts to the media/any book selling platform her book is on.", "I think Reddit has a hard-on for suing without getting that it can be expensive and in the case of something like this you CAN lose for dumb reasons.\n\nThe much cheaper solution is to give her a polite request to correct the narrative, publicly.\n\nSomeone this slimy will probably refuse. Then just put her on blast on social media or the media-media. Put up the proof. The important thing is to publicly show she has provoked you into revealing the truth, not that you are doing it out of malice.\n\nThe customers of life coaches are usually drama and gossip hounds and will lap it all up, so she is going to backtrack FAST to keep the coaching business going.", "Sometimes, just said that because it's possible that a lawyer can do nothing to help OP. Especially since she is just a life coach there is not licensing board to report her too.", "I think we've found the cousin!", "Before you do ANYTHING, talk to an attorney who handles personal torts. You don\u2019t want to set yourself up for her to sue you.", "Winning a libel suit in the US is a pipe dream.", "There may not be a publishing house. She may have self-published.", "for a private figure? which OP probably is? Not so much. That's a much lower bar. It's more in line with many other countries.\n\nPublic figures is where the US tends to take a really broad stance on libel.\n\nThat said. It is a specialized area of law so OP should talk to someone who has experience in it."]}
