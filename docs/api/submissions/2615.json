Unbeknownst to me, it included a major storyline that was extremely embellished about a conflict we had when I was an early teen and still very much a child. Basically, she made me out to be some kind of homicidal maniac. It's just not the truth. Now she's trying to say it was a major trauma in her life even though for the last 2 decades we have been on many family holidays together and I am her child's 'favorite uncle'. She absolutely blindsided me with this. I was not asked, nor told by anyone in my family about this book. An old family friend stumbled upon it and told me, that's how I had to find out. Her sibling, who I am closest with, gave it a five-star review on Amazon. It is important to note she has built a business on being a 'Phoenix from the Flames' type who lifecoaches people. Her family grew up very affluent and has said things in the media like she has grown up in poverty for attention. Absolute lie. More recently, she has been sued for fraud. She went to jail for assaulting her ex husband. Now she's decided to paint me as someone who has done horrible things to her when in fact, it was quite the opposite. She was awful to me. I am hurt that no one in my family told me. I'm hurt that I was not asked if I wanted to be included in this book. My wife is freaking out and doesn't want to talk to any of them ever again. We have teenage sons, this could impact them. Again, I have evidence to show that her description of the events is unequivocally false. My entire family will avoid conflict at every level as much as possible and she even mentions that in her book, so everybody is just kind of  looking the other way on the fact that she completely slandered me. I just don't understand how suddenly, after years, it is written in her book that I'm an absolute horrible human for all to see. I honestly think she's just trying to sell her book I needed a spicy little tale so she can show how resilient and amazing she is and sell her classes.

Then say that event is not how you remember it all but you were both kids and she may recall it differently or just wanted the book to be a bit juicier.

Since this has happened, I''ve been reading a number of articles by professional authors about the 'ethics' of including someone in a nonfiction book and not asking for permission first. I was even reading there could be ramifications for the Publishing company. Although she doesn't use my name, she identifies our family relationship and my age. It could not be any clearer that it's me. I appreciate you mentioning the unethical aspect. That's how I feel about it.", "USA.

I was also a child when it happened.", "She was sued for fraud by former student for her coaching business. I was told about these lawsuits by her brother.

She's good at leading a double life and covering things up.", "The personal villain comment is spot on. We did have a serious conflict when I was a young teen, but it hasn't been mentioned in 20 years and I paid my consequences for it back then. No one was hurt no one was arrested no one went to jail.

Thanks for that.", "Your state bar association should have a hotline for attorney referrals, they can help you find a lawyer who works in the relevant area. Usually the lawyer will give a 20-30 minute phone consult for free, to see if you have a case. Worth a shot.", "Don't sue her. Sue the publishing house. It's also their responsibility to fact check and get waivers from the people involved. Once a case is filed against them, they'll automatically out pressure on your cousin to come to terms with you. Let them know that you would be going public with all the facts that are misrepresented in her book."]}
