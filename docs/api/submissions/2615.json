She absolutely blindsided me with this. I was not asked, nor told by anyone in my family about this book. An old family friend stumbled upon it and told me, that's how I had to find out. Her sibling, who I am closest with, gave it a five-star review on Amazon. It is important to note she has built a business on being a 'Phoenix from the Flames' type who lifecoaches people. Her family grew up very affluent and has said things in the media like she has grown up in poverty for attention. Absolute lie. More recently, she has been sued for fraud. She went to jail for assaulting her ex husband. Now she's decided to paint me as someone who has done horrible things to her when in fact, it was quite the opposite. She was awful to me. I am hurt that no one in my family told me. I'm hurt that I was not asked if I wanted to be included in this book. My wife is freaking out and doesn't want to talk to any of them ever again.
