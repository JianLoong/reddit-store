She's telling thousands of people a horrible story about me with only a small element of truth to it. Also, I do have very clear receipts or I wouldn't even have started this conversation. I think the real thing is the damages are she gets away with saying whatever she wants about people with no consequences it has a long history of being sued for fraud and lying.

She has been sued for fraud by former clients so clearly this is a pattern. If it was such a defining moment for her, she should have asked me for permission to include it in her book, and we could have talked about it. I don't mind the truth being discussed or even published. Instead, she chose me look psychotic and put it in a book without my knowledge. Her truth is not a universal truth. You can't just sideswipe people like that. Seeing all of the posts saying I should sue have really confirmed that this is a major trespass and she was very wrong to do it.", "This needs to be higher!
