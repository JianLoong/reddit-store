Weirf af", "It\u2019s a nightdress. Some prefer wearing them to wearing pj pants, due to the physical feel. And a nightcap can protect the hair. The bigger change is that men don\u2019t wear nightdresses any more, not that some women do.", "Good luck getting any. Seriously, dude you EFF'ed up big time.", "I agree with both of your points but I was focused on the latter. I mean, look at the language used: his mother finds his GF super sweet. He describes her as silly and \u201csomeone who looks like an old man to bed\u201d. Those are literally the only descriptive phrases he uses for her. What. The. F-ck.", "That crossed my mind too. Tons of women I know sleep in those silk caps. That would be hilarious if OP is this clueless", "Yup.", "Are you OP's alt account or something?", "Yeah but it got grandpa to pay them bills.", "TONS of women wear bonnets to protect their hair at night.", "I totally know what you're saying. In a kid sleepover, there's a point at which we say, \"pajama time!\" and everyone changes before bed.\n\nThis story has a similar vibe. I don't know if I've ever gotten around to putting on pj's when I'm staying over at a new partner's place lol", "There are comfy clothes, and then there is an actual night cap. I have never seen one in real life. I have never seen one for sale. It is a VERY specific choice. If I went to bed dressed like a football referee, I would warm someone ahead of time.", "I was just going to say this - it's really common for people with curly/afro hair to wear a silk bonnet for bed, I've even wore one as a white woman with wavy/straight hair just to reduce split ends and keep my hair oil from getting on the pillow. Dude is acting like she came out with a candle holder and started honk shooing in her sleep", "Women does something that isn\u2019t for OP pleasure and OP is shocked.", "My folks keep their house a toasty 60 degrees F at night in the winter, so I wear a fleece watch cap to bed. It really helps me stay warm and sleep! But, yes, I think it looks a bit funny and I absolutely laugh at myself for wearing it.", "Those TV shows showed couples sleeping in separate beds. You really think that was the hot trend, too?", "Should have asked the parents to pick him up from the sleepover :)", "No. Adults don't refer to staying the night at their partner's house as a sleepover. You might be sleeping over, but it's extremely childish to call it a sleepover.", "\"Honk shooing\" hahaha I didnt know what you meant by this until I said it out loud a few times and died laughing", "I've slept in cold weather with no heat, I get it. Wearing a winter hat to bed sometimes makes sense. But you weren't cosplaying Victorian England for no reason.", "Adults parents also don't ask them how their \"sleepovers\" at their partners went. That was also weird.", "\"Hey son, how did it go in the sleepover? Had good sex with the gf? Good, now drink your chocolate milk and eat your cookie!\"", "Yep. Super weird. Like they're all just sitting around the breakfast table as a family wanting to know whether their son/brother had sex the night before and if the sex was any good. It's normal to ask how a date went if your family member started seeing someone new, but asking how the \"sleepover\" went is fucking creepy. \n\n\"Did you get laid last night, son? Don't spare us any details. We want to know ***ALL*** about it.\"", "If that's enough to break your libido, then I recommend you find some medications that help with that.", "Motherfuckers with 290k comment karma talking about preferences to what a partner wears to bed, as if they have a partner. Cmon, bud. You ain't gotta lie to kick it.", "what the fuck are you talking about, it\u2019s a new relationship and the parent wanted to know how the night went, weirdo."]}
