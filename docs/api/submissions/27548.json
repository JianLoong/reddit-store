Like it was a full on Scrooge type outfit with a night shirt and a night cap. She called it \"grandpa core\" and became defensive when I told her she looked super silly. Like she really looked like she was a cartoon character. \n\nNeedless to say it was awkward after that and when I went home in the morning my mom asked me how she was and how our evening was and I told her about the pajamas and both mom, dad and my little brother said I was mean to laugh, and my brother told me that I am weak for being so offended over \"scrooge-core gf\" (i told him about the granpa core comment) and my mom said that I should apologise to her but that is only really because she finds my gf super sweet.\n\nBut fr, am I the asshole for laughing at someone who looks like an old man to bed?
