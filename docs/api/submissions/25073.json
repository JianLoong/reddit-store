Gentle parenting is so much harder than spanking. Spanking rules your kids through fear and \"Gentle\" parenting is about teaching your kids through example of how you expect them to behave with predetermined boundaries and consequences. \n\nSide note I despise the term \"gentle\" parenting. It's just parenting and should be the norm.", "Fair point.", "Lol I guess you could say that. I'm around a 6yo for at least part of my work week so I tend to edit my thoughts carefully when she's there (her mom is my niece, and we work together so she often has her kids with her in the afternoon).", "Yeah around kids 'dammit' becomes 'pencils' which the grandma of a friend used to say often when we were kids. I learned to swear at an early age and at my worst times I can make a sailor blush but by using it so much as an angry teen, it's certainly lessened how I use them as an adult.\nNowadays it is mostly 'shit', 'dammit' and calling people a 'goat' when they are being dumb and I got to clean up their mess... Never in earshot as it is not meant to insult them but rather convey my displeasure.", "YTA for policing your child\u2019s language to appease your neighbors", "I agree with Granddad. At least teach him to be gentlemanly and respectful enough to refrain when with his grandmother. There is a time and a place for everything and your don is too young to just know that so it is your job to teach him.", "Sorry but shit is nothing. Was allowed to use it at 10. The first time I actually said shit in front of my mother was when I smashed a mug. We both cracked up laughing.", "NTA. This seems like a good time to exercise appropriate people to cuss around.

She needs to butt out.", "Nta. Whatsoever. He's going to swear. He's going to call people fucking assholes and whatever else. We all do it. Almost all of us anyway.

We've not expressly allowed him to swear but we have explained when it is and isn't appropriate (and the consequences of using the harder swear words - I.e. timeout/privileges removed) but he treats the milder ones as the harder ones too so doesn't swear at all. Maybe that'll change when he's a teenager.\n\nPoint I'm trying to make is like OP said: your kid, your rules - MIL/FIL needs to wind their necks back in and respect that, though a word with your son to \"try\" not to swear around grandma might go a long way for the sake of peace.", "NTA god i wish my parents did this \ud83d\ude2dinstead i developed a perfect filter around them", "NTA and people who clutch pearls over normal swear words are just the most boring people alive.", "You should have told her to fuck off lmao\n\nMy rule is you can openly say any swear word when you either A.

No swearing in public or at friends houses. 2. no swearing at people. I remember being probably about your son\u2019s age and going out in public with friends, but without supervision, for the first times and my friends being excited to be able to swear because they never could at home or school with supervision. So while they were getting seen in public swearing left and right, potentially upsetting the people around us, I didn\u2019t see what the big deal was because I was taught there\u2019s a time and place to use words like that. I don\u2019t think using a swear occasionally is a problem, as long as you don\u2019t offend the people around you. Maybe talk to him about trying not to let it slip in front of his grandparents, but I don\u2019t see a problem with what he did.", "The most strange cursing policy I\u2019ve ever seen is when I was in the Army. They were adding some women to supply and operations. At this meeting they told us we are no longer allowed to curse around the women. I guess somehow a woman.. who joins the US Army.. ears will melt off it she\u2019s heard a curse word. This is a tall task in a combat arms unit. I pointed out if we completely change the way we talk and interact with each other due to their presence isn\u2019t that sexist? I also said there\u2019s a big difference between \u201cfu(k , I stubbed my toe!\u201d And \u201cI want to fu(k you\u201d\n This policy lasted about ten minutes after meeting them and they cursed..just as much.. or more.. than we did.

As a great friend once told me - not scripture, mind you - that it\u2019s not the word that comes out of your mouth but the intent.  One of the commenters mentioned not calling people names (swearing at each other), and this is how I view it.  Swear words are just words that became \u201cbad\u201d.  You can cuss around me all you want, and I\u2019ll do the same.   So\u2026while there are certainly your more old-fashioned folks out there (they\u2019re the same ones who look down on you for going to church in jeans and a t-shirt), most of the church-going religious folks in my circle all cuss like sailors.\n\nEdit:  former Marine here, so perhaps I should\u2019ve said \u201ccuss like jarheads\u201d.", "We do this, they can swear at home but not at each other, because we shouldn't call each other names anyway. We had friends try and tell us allowing it will just make them think it's ok to use all the time and they will start doing it at school. Well, it hasn't caused any issues. No one has so much as swore in school and they've only slipped by saying it outside of the home a handful of times, but it was in front of my dad and he didnt care. To us, they are just sentence enhancers lol", "Agreed, violence instigates violence.

It drives out in laws up the wall\n\nFor our son we\u2019d word the opinion it\u2019s better to teach him when and where is okay to sweat than an out right ban", "Swear words are a ridiculous social construct. They're words that aren't any more bad then they're counterparts that we use. Shit is no better or worse then shoot. People take issue with it because they were taught to and never questioned it. I've felt for years that it's time to drop it all together (save the word hate for slurs). The whole thing is just arbitrary nonsense.", "NTA. I treat my own 13yr old son the same way. Plus, my family has a long history of cursing like sailors, so I'd feel pretty hypocritical telling my teenaged son to stop cursing.", "Nta, but i also want to ask. Why do people consider \u201chell\u201d a swear word? I used it all the time when i was under 13, yet i\u2019d get this look like i\u2019d just said \u201cgod motherfucking DAMNIT\u201d and as far as i\u2019m concerned \u201cdamn\u201d is just as mild as \u201cdang\u201d or \u201cdarn\u201d tbh it may have just been my parents because of my mom\u2019s catholicism controlling her every thought n whim. If i used \u201cdamnit\u201d then no one\u2019d bat an eye, i use \u201cgod damnit\u201d and suddenly EVERYONE loses their minds, my mom specifically.\u201d", "NTA I both allowed my teen son to swear and have the occasional drink. He had to come home to drink. I knew he would do it anyway and this way he was taught to do it responsibly.  I should add that hell and damn were never swear words at home as I was raised by an Brit", "NTA, 13 is a reasonable age to start swearing just a litttlleee... (In my opinion) And its good that you set some ground rules. I don't see how someone can get angry at a teenager and their parents for the teen swearing, in what of could been an accident by the sounds of it.

Mental disorder, and crazy are the same thing. In fact crazy used to be a medical term.", "NTA, we allow our son (12) to use the milder swear words, but only while gaming or as a reflex.

So she told me what the words were and that they were for adults and that we could use them in the house but only during a certain time. So when they'd say \"ok, swear word night, five minutes, go!\u201d my brother and I would have the time of our lives. \n\nUnfortunately, they never thought about the word dick and when my five year old brother yelled that he pinched his dick in his zipper in a public restroom, they were SHOCKED.
