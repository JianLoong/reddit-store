But you know how it can be with the police even for a minor pull over. So it took about an hour and 15 minutes. When I pulled over I texted my parents that I saw an accident and I would probably be late. They asked how late. I said I don't know. The whole time they were texting me and asking me if I left. They asked when I'd be there and why I'm so late. I eventually called them and explained the situation. It was a REALLY bad car accident. They kept implying that there are other witnesses and I could just leave to go to dinner. I was talking to police and other witnesses and they were constantly blowing up my phone. I texted them to please no interrupt me during this time. Then they were like \"how dare you talk to us like that?\" and I just ignored them until I got there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got home dinner was nearly over. Most of my family was pretty cool and just asked how I was. My parents and aunt were really upset and said that they waited 45 minutes and didn't let anyone eat so they wouldn't start without me. I sad that was silly and they should have ate when I told them I would be a while. They said I should always make it on time and I explained that I am an adult and this was a pretty serious event.

I would have pulled over too. Crazy that your family doesn't understand that? Had you been the one IN the accident would they have reacted the same way? Witnesses are important for insurance purposes and honestly for SUING purposes.", "NTA.  You literally told them that you would be late, probably really late, and why.  If they can't accept that, that's on them.  FWIW, you're an adult and you really don't need a reason to skip a weekly dinner.  What on earth are they going to do the first time you don't come at all?", "NTA, shit happens, expecting to be the highest priority of your adult children's lives is narcissistic and toxic.", "NTA. You could have been involved in the accident instead of a witness. Would your parents have  forgiven your tardiness then? Your family is outrageously ridiculous.", "NTA. You witnessed an accident. You did your civic duty by not only pulling over to call emergency services, but you also provided vital information to the police (and chances are, if it was bad enough, the people who recreate accidents). You did what had to be done. \n\nLet your parents and aunt throw all the tantrums they want; that just makes them look petty and childish.", "NTA\n\nIt's a weekly dinner. You stopped one time to help others. Absolutely nothing morally wrong with that.", "NTA. Listen, I get that your family comes from a different country, and different cultures have different mores around these things. Not to sound too old fashioned, but I was raised here in the states with the idea of civic duty. Meaning: You pay your taxes. You do NOT try to get out of jury duty. You vote. And if you can be of assistance to the police in a situation like this ... if you witnessed a significant crime or other incident and they need information from you ... you provide that information. Your family is totally off the mark in hassling you for doing what good citizens do. \\*\n\n\\*I know that there has been a bunch of bad behavior on behalf of the police recently, and I would not give testimony about seeing a kid steal a candy bar if the kid were shot by the cops for stealing the candy bar. But this is a very different type of situation.", "NTA\n\nYou witnessed a bad accident and had to talk to the police, you called them to make them aware of the situation and that should have been enough for them especially if most of the family were okay with it!", "Why would you be the asshole for that?", "NTA.  Your parents though are.  Demanding that you must be on time for their family dinner and to totally disregard everything else is classic controlling and asshole behavior.", "NTA, I find it horrifying how insensitive people can be over these things. My cousin died in a car crash so the road was closed for awhile. I was absolutely disgusted to see everyone online complaining about the delay because they wanted to get to the beach!", "NTA. Your family sounds very controlling.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Your parents and aunt have serious issues, the whole how dare you talk to us like that comment is really telling that they don't respect you as an adult.", "How does this make you an asshole ? You had a justifiable reason for being late?", "NTA - I would have done the exact same thing as you", "NTA. As a witness you had important information to contribute to this sad incident. Dinner can wait.", "YTA for writing this whole story when it's so unbelievably obvious that you're NTA. How could you possibly be the asshole in this situation? I find it impossible to believe you're being genuine in asking this question.", "Info- after calling the police and waiting for first responders, what help could you have given?

You shouldn't have to ask.", "NTA.\n\nI mean this is ridiculous. You were doing the right thing assisting police in their investigation. Your family is so far out of line on this one it is more than absurd, it is outright obscene!\n\nAnd it is not fair to say there were other witnesses - there were no other witnesses that were in your shoes, in your place with your point of view at that time!\n\nWhat if it was an emergency where you were rendering first aid to someone or comforting them in a moment of crisis? Would your family expect you to abandon that person and let them die or let them be afraid because a family dinner is more important than life, compassion, conscience or human decency?\n\nIf there is a next time, I'd text your family about the delay saying you do not know how long the delay will be, and that they should not wait for you.

This behavior is highly inappropriate, from family. You\u2019re a witness to a terrible situation that also incurs a legal obligation.

You witness an accident, or a tree falls across a road or a giant crane is installing equipment or a water main breaks or... \n\nThe only reasonable reaction was \"Oh, OP, thank heavens it wasn't YOU who was in the accident, are you OK? Here, we kept your dinner warm and we saved you a big piece of dessert, and here's your favorite drink. You won't believe what happened to cousin Elbert this week, that scamp...\"\n\nIn other words, they should just be happy to see you, whatever time you arrive.

One. NTA.", "NTA and why is your family not happy that you stopped to help? I don\u2019t understand. Maybe it\u2019s time to start going once a month or something.

I've been an on-site witness of a car accident too. I was out of it for a week, just trying to wrap my head around what I saw and heard. Take your time, OP. You need it. Also your family can go suck an egg.", "hijacking top comment to add - obviously NTA, you did the responsible thing and your family should be proud of that, not giving you a hard time over it.\n\nBut please please please make sure that should you need to, you access mental health supports after witnessing such a serious accident. It can be really upsetting to see these things and to go through the details of reporting etc. You made sure you were doing the right thing for the people who were involved in the accident, so make sure you do the right thing for yourself too.", "Yeah I know that\u2019s more of a cultural thing, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d go weekly to a massive family dinner like that.
