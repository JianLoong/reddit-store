Why are his relatives not cooking for themselves?  IMO you should tell them what you think and how you feel, expressing your welcome to their visit ... \"But I am not cooking for you.\"  Do what make you happy.  You deserve it.", "INFO - whose house are you living in?\n\nIf you're living in your in-law's house, you should be ironing our a series of chores and responsibilities with all household members. If there is an expectation that you do certain things (like cook for the family) in lieu of rent, then yes, you should be cooking for everyone on agreed-upon days/nights based on those expectations. But even so, I would think that cooking duties should be shared.\n\nIf the mom / grandma are living in YOUR house, I would set clearer house rules and perhaps a family meal night a certain set number of days per week, where perhaps you cook a meal everyone can eat (or put the meat to the side) and make it clear to other family members the expectation they are on their own for other meals, assuming that there is not dire financial deprivation / some other reason preventing mom / grandma from being able to cook.\n\nI think ultimately you have a HUSBAND issue because in any case, your partner should be taking this matter up with his mom / grandma and enforcing whatever arrangement you decide.   \n\n\nNTA.", "Info: This is hard to follow, how many ppl live there?

If so are you paying rent?", "NTA. It would be one thing if you were intentionally not cooking enough food so she couldn\u2019t eat with you guys but for her to expect you to cook her an entire other meal is just ridiculous.", "NTA - as long as it wasn't within the parameters of you moving in.  It can also depend on cultural and generational values.    \nINFO:  Do you pay rent and utilities and/or share the grocery bill? That makes a difference as well.\n\nFinally, if she wants to bitch about a meal not being made for her and is viable, make her a basic salad with vegetarian Indian lentils \"heated up\" on the side (the fast premade/microwaveable). Hey, it is food and it is vegetarian...and you made it.  5-15 minutes maximum.  \n\nAnother option is to bulk cook 1-2 options on the weekends for her to enjoy.  Whatever is left, freeze as \"TV Dinners\" to be reheated at will.  Max time:  5-8 hours on one day and lasts about 1-2 weeks.", "INFO: whose house are you living in and why are you all living together?", "ESH.\n\nI'm going to guess this is a cultural thing with really strong expectations around gender roles and generational responsibilities. As the daughter in law, OP, the expectation is that you'll do whatever MIL tells you to do, including cook for her and her mother.\n\nYour husband likely doesn't cook because people with penises don't cook. That's your job, not his.\n\nCooking meals for MIL is likely not optional. You have to do it. If you're tired, don't cook a separate meal for yourself or your husband.\n\nIf my guesses are anywhere close to right, you are NTA but you should probably rethink whether or not your want to stay married because of the servanthood that is being demanded of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
