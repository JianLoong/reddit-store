I (26M) dated my ex girlfriend in high school when we were both 16. I had a crush on her since second grade so when she finally agreed to go out with me in High School I was over the moon. \n\nUnfortunately our relationship was a nightmare. I quickly realised she has low self esteem, constantly asked for reassurance from me about her looks and weight, and if I didn't tell her what she wanted to hear she would gaslight and manipulate me to make me feel guilty. \n\nI didn't realise at the time but after reading stuff online and listening to some podcasts I realised her behaviour was emotionally abusive.\n\nWe dated for around one year and she ended up breaking up with me citing her mental health etc. etc. I never saw her after high school because we moved to different cities and also her social media accounts were set to private.\n\nRecently there was a high school reunion. I found out she would be there so I decided to go. \n\nShe hadn't changed much, was still overweight. She said hi to me as if nothing had happened and proceeded to make small talk with me. It really bothered me that she was pretending nothing happened between us so I asked if we can talk privately.\n\nI told her about how I felt about the way she treated me and was abusive towards me when we were dating. She said something like she was going through a tough time with her self confidence and apologised for taking it out on me etc. etc. Said ever since she met her current partner she was feeling more confident about herself. She then told me they were engaged which also came as a shock to me.\n\nI asked her if she had told him about us and how she treated me when we were dating, she said she mentioned her past relationships to him but didn't share all the details. I told her she needs to tell him about how she was abusive to me so that he knows who he is marrying! At this point she made up some excuse and ran away from the conversation.\n\nI felt that the new partner should know what he's getting into. She is still overweight and has not made any effort to change or improve herself and probably has the same insecurities and I imagined how this man will have a terrible marriage. So after the party I used a friend's account to find her fiance and I sent him a message detailing the things she did when we were dating in high school. He responded with something like asking me to stop bothering them.\n\nIt's been about a week since I did this and now I am getting bombarded with messages from high school friends calling me a creep and an a-hole. I don't understand how people can side with her when she was the one being abusive. And it is her responsibility to let her fiance know about this, I was doing what I felt was the right thing. I thought maybe they are reacting this was because they don't have the full story and the background about our relationship.\n\nSo I wanted to post here. AITA? Or am I helping this poor man?\n\nEdit: OKAY! I was expecting my perspective would be divisive but didn't realise people would think it's that bad. Reading though all your comments is making me question myself. First of all, I don't have a problem with her weight I think she's cute. It may be true that I am hung up on her, she was my first and only long term girlfriend. And no, I am not an Andrew Tate fan, I just saw some videos of him and thought they were interesting, I don't know that much about him. I do think I deserved more from her than an apology, and I did always think we would end up together once she worked on herself. I feel very frustrated about how things turned out. I am against therapy so I won't do that. I might contact her again to see if she will talk to me, maybe that will bring more closure. Even though it was mostly negative, I still appreciate the comments.", "created_utc": 1700990888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184717p/aita_for_exposing_my_abusive_ex_girlfriend_to_her/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Deduced from the little interaction you had with her that she was still abusive and went up to her fianc\u00e9 to warn him about his abusive soon-to-be wife who you haven't seen AGAIN in 10 years.

Get yourself professional psychological help and show this thread to your psychologist. Your behaviour is vile.", "Doesn\u2018t really sound like she was the abusive one\u2026 if you brought up her weight as often as you did alone in this small post I can see why she was insecure and reactionary gaslighting you. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou stalked this person to find out they would be at a high school reunion, then went to the reunion to drum up old feeling of resentment because she was a little mean to you in the past?  And then you try to ruin her life?\n\nYou need help. Move on", "Not only was this a decade ago but she was literally a child. You don't know her now as an adult, you only know the memory of her as a 16 year old. You're 26 and still fixated on a teenager, that's not right. You need to move on", "YTA. So, you a 26 year old adult - still harbor a grudge about a dating relationship from when you were 16/17. About 10 freaking years ago!\n\nMaybe she was a manipulative \"mean girl\" shrew back then, fully knowing what she was doing. Maybe she was an angsty teen with family issues she didn't know how to handle appropriately. \n\nEither way, because you \"read up\" on the behavior she had 10 years ago - and when did you read up on this? 8 years ago and it's been sitting on your thoughts all this time? 2 years ago because you are still hung up on her and the behavior? \n\nI am pretty sure she had other relationships over the past 10 years that you did not \"warn.\" No need to push on this now. \n\nAgain, the behavior of a 16 year old teen should not be held for the next 10+ years as \"who\" she is. \n\nBack off.

So she keeps asking for some reinsurance, because her own bf keeps insulting her....\n\n3. You ACTUALLY insult her, calling her stupid\n\n4. She has a reasonable reaction to your abuse, and you try to manipulate her into thinking she is overreacting\n\n5. You cyber stalk her\n\n6. You harass her and her fiance\n\n\nDude...

If I were her, I'd be quite worried about your behavior.\n\nStop obsessing, it's not worth anyone's time.", "Just want to clarify I don't have any issues with her being overweight, I think she looks very cute and beautiful. I only said that because when she broke up with me she said she wanted to work on her insecurities (a big part was her weight). She even said maybe it was not the right time for us to date because of how she feels about herself when breaking up with me. So I am surprised that she is still the same weight now and is going to marry someone. I don't see how she will treat him any differently. So that was the reason why I mentioned the weight not because I have issues with it.", "I agree she may have changed. I did keep track of her through common friends and was following where she was in life, I didn't know she was engaged this came as a big shock to me. I feel that I know her better than her fiance since I know her since we were eight and even though we didn't speak since high school I did get updates on her via mutual friends. I thought maybe if we tried again together as adults we can have a better relationship this time and if she apologised for being abusive and promised she will be better this time I was willing to give her another chance.

I think he is misunderstood.", "For example we were both into anime, and for my birthday she bought me a poster of my favourite anime character at the time (Asuna from SOA). She then proceeded to ask me if I think she is prettier or Asuna. And when I didn't tell her what she wanted to hear she proceeded to cry. This is just one example but it was constantly stuff like this, asking reassurance about her looks and her weight and throwing a tantrum if I was honest with her.", "Nope, YTA. \n\nLike teenage her might have had issues with her weight but adult her might not because we grow. Also you don\u2019t know nor don\u2019t deserve to know if there are medical issues with her weight. \n\nWho we were as teens does not mean we are the same as adults. \n\nYou\u2019re an asshole trying to screw another adults life over teenage romance drama.

Working on her insecurities doesn\u2019t have to mean losing weight! It more likely meant accepting herself as she is and that her weight doesn\u2019t define her!

YTA for sure!", "I\u2019ve been with my bf since we were 17 and we changed so much since then. We may look the same, but we matured and I think that she did that too and she probably asked for help to a psychiatrist. She was there and apologised to you, that\u2019s a good thing to do.

The person you still have feelings for does not exist anymore. You do not know who she currently is, regardless of how much you\u2019ve been \u201ckeeping track\u201d.

Not trying to down playing emotional abuse but not all shitty relationships are abusive and just because you read something on the Internet doesn't mean she abused you. You need to go get some therapy if you truly believe what you're saying because stalking her on social media (even while incognito), confronting her and being dissatisfied with her response to your accusations, and then telling her fianc\u00e9 about something that happened years ago, is all a bit overkill no?

When you came to know she has moved on and found someone you were shocked that she found someone compatible with her and  got engaged.

Got it!\n  It doesn't matter if you are willing to give her a chance or not because she doesn't even want it. It's irrelvant if you feel you know her better or not because we can see you clearly don't and she is an adult who can make her own decision. \n     And about abusive teenage behavior,  first of all teenagers do lots of weird shit and most of them in later stage realize their fault and correct themselves,  people mature with age except you it seems.

You confronted her about how toxic your relationship was when you guys were teenagers, and she apologised.\n \nYou keep making reference about her weight like it matters.

You guys don't talk and are not friends. \nJust, because you have mutal friends and got information from them doesn't mean you know who she is now. People change from when they were children/teens.

Then I felt pressured to do it with her. \nOr there was another time when she came to meet my parents.
