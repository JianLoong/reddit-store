He can't help his colorblindness, and I worry that I might have made him feel bad about it. But at the same time, I don't think I'm the asshole because the paint set was expensive and it's not something I will use.

I think Ben could have anticipated something like this happening, knowing his own inability to see certain colors. That\u2019s an odd and bold gift choice for someone who is colorblind.", "NTA\nPaints will be labelled. He could have read what colours he was buying. He know this is an area he needs help with so he should have asked someone or the salesperson to check.", "NTA he could definitely still buy the correct paint since the color is always written. i kind of understand his hurt? but youre right that it is best to exchange for something you actually want, instead of keeping something you dislike out of politeness. you thanked him and was gentle about it, you werent rude by pointing it out", "NTA. I too am colorblind. There are so many steps he could have taken to avoid this.\n\n\nAs someone else mentioned, the package itself had to have the color name printed on it. He could have gotten help from an employee to confirm the colors as well.", "NTA. You were polite about the mistake, and if he intended to get you the paints that you wanted, why would he get upset that you pointed out he picked up the wrong version?! \n\nAlso he didn't put a lot of thought into it if he a) got you something you'd said you wanted, and b) got the wrong thing, which is something you won't use.", "Did he say he was getting you that specific set or did he just get you a set as a nice gift?", "NAH to be honest, choosing paint as a present if you are colorblind sounds like a brilliant idea.", "NAH - I think it's just an unfortunate situation all round, and you just misjudged how he would react. That said, perhaps now that you've learned how much it has upset him, you could channel that guilt into something productive, like finding a way to use the paints you have.", "NTA i think it was dumb as fuck for Ben to go this route for a gift and you are under no obligation to pretend it was a good gift to spare his precious feelings\n\nwe're all adults here, if somebody buys you a shitty gift there's no reason for you to grin and bear it", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m colorblind, myself. I get it wrong a lot, but I don\u2019t take offense when someone points out a color mistake that I\u2019ve made. It\u2019s a reflection of my being born with eyes that don\u2019t see color properly, not of me as a person. NTA", "NAH\n\n  \nThere are times when you smile and suck it up if you get a gift you don't love, but when it's an expensive item, you don't want someone to waste their money. I think you've shown respect for Ben's money, frankly.", "\n\nNo, you are not the asshole. You were kind when you thanked Ben and followed that up with a suggestion for a fun day out to exchange the paint for something else. You were not being ungrateful and it was not rude to point out the mistake. Colorblindness can be difficult, but Ben should also understand that it is important to get gifts that the recipient can use. Chances are, Ben only wanted to get you something special, and understands why you needed to exchange it.", "YTA\n\nYou should have just thanked him for the lovely paint set, and exchanged it for the right set, quietly on your own.\n\n*If* he discovered that you exchanged it, you could have just said something to the effect of, \"oh, the colors you bought were gorgeous, but I though I could get more use out of the primary set. Very pedestrian of me I know!\"", "YTA. You should have just been grateful for the gift.", "[deleted]", "INFO: Youre an artist that hates the color green?", "I\u2019m not sure why you had to tell him. Just either keep it or return it for the right set. I think it\u2019s hurtful and unnecessary to point out that it wasn\u2019t the right one.", "Ben is kind of an idiot, since I\u2019m assuming the paint packaging had info on the colors and knowing he is colorblind he should probably have looked at that and paid attention to the specifics. Also, my brother is colorblind and he would say Ben is being too sensitive.\n\nBut YTA. IMO you should always act grateful and gracious when you receive a gift. If Ben included the receipt and said something like \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if this is what you wanted, so feel free to exchange it\u201d that would be fine. If not, you say thank you, put it on a shelf, and move on with your life.", "ESH. I think he should have used more wisdom in not doing something so color-dependent when he knows this is a struggle for him. But I don't know why you talked with him about it when you could have probably just returned them for in-store credit, since I think most stores will take paint back for in-store credit and exchanges so long as they're not opened. Isn't that like Gift Receiving 101, that you try to exchange the item WITHOUT telling the person you're doing it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My great uncle was colorblind and he always either took someone with him to confirm the colors or he\u2019d ask a worker at the store. \n\nIf you have a disability it\u2019s up to you to make it work for you and not against you.", "Maybe it's the German (at least I'm born here) in me, but NTA. It's normal here to keep the receipts of gifts and allow the person to exchange them usually too. \n\nI understand how it could have hurt his feelings, but it doesn't do any harm to ask the person who is supposed to receive the gift.

Ben needs to understand his limitations in that area and not get sulky when the obvious is pointed out.", "Also don't paints usually have a name for the color?

Write support?", "He most likely did read them, and unless OP makes it explicitly clear whenever they talk about the names of the colors she does want + how much she hates green specifically, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d have any way of knowing. I doubt he\u2019d put enough effort into a gift to be upset about her response if he didn\u2019t even read what he was buying", "I had talked about the paint set I wanted with Ben before, and even showed him pictures online.", "Good point! I had talked about the paint set I wanted with Ben before, and even showed him pictures online. The set I liked had a variety of colors, not just greens. Each color in the set does have a specific name listed. But, given his colorblindness, I guess he got confused between the two sets. I didn't make a big deal out of it when I brought up the mix-up, though.", "I appreciate your perspective and understand where you're coming from. My intention wasn't to hurt Ben's feelings but to be honest and open with him. In retrospect, handling it the way you suggested could have prevented him from feeling bad. I'll keep this in mind for the future", "I don't necessarily hate the color green, but the paint set Ben got me leans heavily on various shades of green which doesn't suit my usual art style. I often work with a broader spectrum of colors, and my art isn't usually focused on landscapes or nature scenes where green would be prevalent.", "'Green is not a creative colour'", "Idk, there are people who will just buy someone socks and be upset if they aren't super grateful, and that requires no thought whatsoever. \n\nThis is why I don't like surprising people with gifts or getting surprise gifts, there's always the chance you accidentally give or receive the wrong thing because there's usually a decent amount of guesswork if you aren't asking the gift recipient. \n\nPaint supplies are definitely something that should have zero ambiguity if you're thinking about getting it for someone, both due to the cost and how varied palettes are.", "I mean did he say he was going to get you that one?", "Ben wanted to surprise me with the paint set, he did not tell me about it until my birthday.", "Well then he didn\u2019t say which one he was getting \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You should want the gift recipient to be happy with the gift. If you got something here unhappy with, what\u2019s the problem with exchanging it together? It\u2019s a win win. Your thought was appreciated and the recipient gets what they wanted in the end. \n\nIt has nothing to do with what he said he was getting beforehand."]}
