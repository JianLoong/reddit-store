I think he should have used more wisdom in not doing something so color-dependent when he knows this is a struggle for him.

However if color is a defining factor for the intent of the gift then I would be asking a 3rd party friend or a store clerk. \n\nYou handled this well, almost exactly as I have asked others to handle my color blindness based mix ups, his response should have shown maturity, even a funny \"oopsie\" but it did not.", "NTA, he\u2019s just embarrassed and maybe his instant reaction was to be hurt even though he had good intentions.", "He either did this on purpose or was really misguided.

It's always been somewhere between fuscia and magenta.\n\nFucking kids these days.", "Maybe that's the issue that Ben is more annoyed at himself?", "Given that many non-colorblind people only know the names of about 11 colors (red, blue, yellow, orange, purple, green, black, gray, white, brown, & pink) expecting them to know that pine and Kelly are shades of green may be a bit much.
