He know this is an area he needs help with so he should have asked someone or the salesperson to check.", "NTA he could definitely still buy the correct paint since the color is always written. i kind of understand his hurt? but youre right that it is best to exchange for something you actually want, instead of keeping something you dislike out of politeness. you thanked him and was gentle about it, you werent rude by pointing it out", "NTA. I too am colorblind. There are so many steps he could have taken to avoid this.\n\n\nAs someone else mentioned, the package itself had to have the color name printed on it. He could have gotten help from an employee to confirm the colors as well.", "NTA. You were polite about the mistake, and if he intended to get you the paints that you wanted, why would he get upset that you pointed out he picked up the wrong version?! \n\nAlso he didn't put a lot of thought into it if he a) got you something you'd said you wanted, and b) got the wrong thing, which is something you won't use.", "Did he say he was getting you that specific set or did he just get you a set as a nice gift?", "NAH to be honest, choosing paint as a present if you are colorblind sounds like a brilliant idea.", "NAH - I think it's just an unfortunate situation all round, and you just misjudged how he would react. That said, perhaps now that you've learned how much it has upset him, you could channel that guilt into something productive, like finding a way to use the paints you have.", "NTA i think it was dumb as fuck for Ben to go this route for a gift and you are under no obligation to pretend it was a good gift to spare his precious feelings\n\nwe're all adults here, if somebody buys you a shitty gift there's no reason for you to grin and bear it", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m colorblind, myself. I get it wrong a lot, but I don\u2019t take offense when someone points out a color mistake that I\u2019ve made.

NTA", "NAH\n\n  \nThere are times when you smile and suck it up if you get a gift you don't love, but when it's an expensive item, you don't want someone to waste their money. I think you've shown respect for Ben's money, frankly.", "\n\nNo, you are not the asshole. You were kind when you thanked Ben and followed that up with a suggestion for a fun day out to exchange the paint for something else. You were not being ungrateful and it was not rude to point out the mistake. Colorblindness can be difficult, but Ben should also understand that it is important to get gifts that the recipient can use. Chances are, Ben only wanted to get you something special, and understands why you needed to exchange it.", "YTA\n\nYou should have just thanked him for the lovely paint set, and exchanged it for the right set, quietly on your own.\n\n*If* he discovered that you exchanged it, you could have just said something to the effect of, \"oh, the colors you bought were gorgeous, but I though I could get more use out of the primary set. Very pedestrian of me I know!\"", "YTA. You should have just been grateful for the gift.", "[deleted]", "INFO: Youre an artist that hates the color green?", "I\u2019m not sure why you had to tell him. Just either keep it or return it for the right set. I think it\u2019s hurtful and unnecessary to point out that it wasn\u2019t the right one.", "Ben is kind of an idiot, since I\u2019m assuming the paint packaging had info on the colors and knowing he is colorblind he should probably have looked at that and paid attention to the specifics. Also, my brother is colorblind and he would say Ben is being too sensitive.\n\nBut YTA. IMO you should always act grateful and gracious when you receive a gift. If Ben included the receipt and said something like \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if this is what you wanted, so feel free to exchange it\u201d that would be fine. If not, you say thank you, put it on a shelf, and move on with your life.", "ESH. I think he should have used more wisdom in not doing something so color-dependent when he knows this is a struggle for him. But I don't know why you talked with him about it when you could have probably just returned them for in-store credit, since I think most stores will take paint back for in-store credit and exchanges so long as they're not opened. Isn't that like Gift Receiving 101, that you try to exchange the item WITHOUT telling the person you're doing it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's normal here to keep the receipts of gifts and allow the person to exchange them usually too. \n\nI understand how it could have hurt his feelings, but it doesn't do any harm to ask the person who is supposed to receive the gift.

I had talked about the paint set I wanted with Ben before, and even showed him pictures online. The set I liked had a variety of colors, not just greens. Each color in the set does have a specific name listed. But, given his colorblindness, I guess he got confused between the two sets. I didn't make a big deal out of it when I brought up the mix-up, though.", "I appreciate your perspective and understand where you're coming from. My intention wasn't to hurt Ben's feelings but to be honest and open with him. In retrospect, handling it the way you suggested could have prevented him from feeling bad. I'll keep this in mind for the future", "I don't necessarily hate the color green, but the paint set Ben got me leans heavily on various shades of green which doesn't suit my usual art style. I often work with a broader spectrum of colors, and my art isn't usually focused on landscapes or nature scenes where green would be prevalent.", "'Green is not a creative colour'", "Idk, there are people who will just buy someone socks and be upset if they aren't super grateful, and that requires no thought whatsoever. \n\nThis is why I don't like surprising people with gifts or getting surprise gifts, there's always the chance you accidentally give or receive the wrong thing because there's usually a decent amount of guesswork if you aren't asking the gift recipient. \n\nPaint supplies are definitely something that should have zero ambiguity if you're thinking about getting it for someone, both due to the cost and how varied palettes are.", "I mean did he say he was going to get you that one?", "Ben wanted to surprise me with the paint set, he did not tell me about it until my birthday.", "Well then he didn\u2019t say which one he was getting \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You should want the gift recipient to be happy with the gift.

Not reading the label, not asking an employe? I'm sorry, but he may have spend money but definitly not thought.  \n\n\nAns no, this was not rude.", "Why tf would a colour blind mf'er choose to buy you a set of paints, knowing full well he has no comprehension of what colours he's buying?! Nta he's a moron", "Maybe with the color issue, since paints all have color codes, gently suggest next time that we talk with paint codes instead. He does coding. He does have a limitation here but at the same time, could you have just exchanged it without telling him he got the wrong one?", "NTA, he should have offered to take you out to get them. That sounds like a fun day out.", "NAH - I\u2019m colourblind myself, and i believe he\u2019s at least trying, yes he could\u2019ve read the packaging (if it were labelled), but does he know it\u2019s your least favourite colour? Could\u2019ve been an honest mistake. In all honesty, asking him to exchange it with you is kinda a dick move as it\u2019s a *gift,* but I don\u2019t blame you for trying. If you\u2019re an artist, even though it\u2019s your least favourite colour, it\u2019ll still be useful, maybe that\u2019s what he was thinking about, as many backgrounds require green.

It would be worse to just let the paint sit there and never be used.", "I mean.. you couldn't have just thanked him and exchanged the paints on your own?\n\nI can see why he'd be hurt to be honest. \n\nNAH.

It is the height of crassness to reject a gift. Even 5 year olds know this, but the great artist hasn't learned it yet.", "You're kind of an AH.. just be grateful, thank him, and use it for something else. After all, you are an artist. It'll come in hand eventually, then go get the stuff you actually needed.

This is why gift receipts are a thing so you can exchange them.", "NTA. My son is colorblind, and he would never buy paint for someone without taking a non-colorblind person with him.", "If it was over like 60, I\u2019d say y-t-a, under then no. Is it possible that the green set was on sale and he was doing what he could afford?

I am also very colourblind, green is a colour i really struggle with. If I'm buying something that is colour-based, I check names, or I have a friend buy it for me.

What store/brand sells paint without names? I agree with you, Ben knows his inability and in this instance he should have either read the description or asked someone for help...", "Erm, can he not read as well? Don't paints come in boxes with labrls?", "Exactly, I\u2019m colorblind, which means both I\u2019m super vigilant about making sure I\u2019m reading descriptions, and asking for help if I need, and moreover, not being sensitive if I get it wrong.", "To be fair. There could possibly be a few called somwthing with green in it and the ithers could be \"ocean surprises\" or \"carrot stem\"", "Not if OP needs the receipt or the card or the account of the original buyer.", "I assume he didn't gift it with the receipt.", "Or just the packages might have two very different names. OP was looking at \u201cneon rainbow\u201d and friend grabs \u201cbaby vomit\u201d- you don\u2019t need color vision to read the name of the product", "Yep, apparently his biggest problem isn't colorblindness, it's being dumb af, so dumb that he gets upset when a gift he didn't bother reading the contents list for when he knows he's colorblind is the wrong one, he gets upset when thats pointed out.", "You can exchange without saying anything.", "I find it hard to believe that he has never heard op mention that she dislikes the color green. I could maybe see it if she wasn't an artist, cause that sort of thing probably wouldn't come up very often then, but if that's the case, he wouldn't have been gifting her the paint set to begin with.", "Could you have exchanged it alone?", "True. Most places will allow an exchange for a diff product at the same store though.", "Not necessarily. Don't many shop require either the receipt or the card of the original buyer? I feel like if OP could have exchanged it on his own he would have done so.", "Then there's nothing stopping it from happening again.\n\nGently pointing out what's gone wrong is the more mature response but you really need the other person to be mature enough to hear it too", "I don\u2019t doubt she\u2019s mentioned it but unless it\u2019s brought up frequently I don\u2019t see how anyone could expect him to remember this, I know my loved one\u2019s favorite colors but genuinely could not tell you if there\u2019s any color they hate. Plus it\u2019s not like he can see it\u2019s a color she doesn\u2019t use often", "you're being obtuse. if you giving someone a gift and they have talked about the specifics of what they want and you get them something different, then you should expect them to be disappointed"]}
