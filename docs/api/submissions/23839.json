Like any other couple they have ups and downs but nothing crazy.\nThree months ago my mom catch my dad cheating with a woman she knows since childhood. My mom lives in the same house since birth and they were and still are neighbors.\nLet's call her Jenny this women was at my parents wedding and my siblings and I know her (I have 4 siblings). We are not close at all or know her very well but we know her.\nJust a few weeks before my mom found out she and Jenny chatted after she came to pick up something of my house for a party with the neighbors, she also hold and played with my youngest brother (6) and told my mom how beautiful he is and how beautiful her family is. \nShe found out about the cheating for Facebook messages.

Neither of them did this. They are BOTH home wreckers, and you are absolutely not in the wrong for calling that woman and your father for what they are.", "NTA.

She is clearly not an innocent party.\n\nThe audacity of demanding an apology from you for just stating facts and basically showing legitimate anger is just baffling to me.", "NTA- I guess the truth hurts!", "Fuck her. NTA.", "NTA, we all need to tell a truth like that once in a while.", "NTA. Yes, your dad is the biggest betrayer in the scheme of things, but she is also a contributor. Hell would freeze over before I would ever have a relationship with a married or committed man, let alone with a friend of mine.", "Apologize for saying something accurate?\nNope\nNTA", "NTA.

I might be wrong.\n\nBut I feel like as long as you gave her and your father the same treatment, you're not really picking sides there.\n\nAnd yes, your dad cheated on your mom.  And he's the one who harmed your mom.  But she was an adult and she knew what she was doing.  Her comfort in the moment was more important than her friend's marriage.", "NTA, no you do not owe her an apology At All.  this isn't \"Dad lied and said he was single and mom found out he was cheating.\"  This was a neighbor who has visited KNOWS he's married and made the CHOICE to have sex with a married man.  Those were HER decisions, she could absolutely have said \"No I am not the kind of person to sleep with a married man\"  She did not and you rightfully called her out on it.", "NTA. Both your father and his mistress are equally culpable. She has known your mother since childhood; she went to your parents wedding; she is a neighbour; she went on outings with your father and brother; she was seen engaging with your father for some time; she pretends that nothing is wrong to your face. The woman sounds delusional to be honest.", "NTA\n\nThe, \"it was your father who cheated\" line has and will always be bullshit to me. It takes two to tango in adultery, and while I certainly wouldn't say the homewrecker deserves all of the blame they still deserve 50% if they were aware of what they were doing. To say otherwise is to ok someone acting in a deceitful fashion and stepping in on a pre-existing family knowing full well their actions will lead to that family imploding and its members being hurt.\n\nCalling it sexist is just self-indulgent BS. The kind of argument cooked up by someone looking for a hall pass. Sure, if you were blaming just the other woman I'd maybe agree, but whether the other party is male or female they still deserve blame alongside the married figure.\n\nThis is especially hurtful because the woman doing this was an alleged family friend, but she still backstabbed your mother all the same like she didn't even care. That she's demanding an apology now proves she lacks any self-awareness or shame, which is just sad.\n\nedit - Also, your mothers out of line. You did hold your father accountable, you were just giving this woman her share for acting twofaced in public after what she did.", ">She went to my house to demand an apology saying that it was sexist of me to say that to her.\n\nNAH. She's right. So are you. And so is your mother. Give her the apology so you can be predictable enemies before this feud escalates any further.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It takes 2 to tango and she knew he was married and was involved in both of your parents lives for a long time. She is just as much to blame as your father, and to be honest I don\u2019t understand why your mother would defend her especially after she tried denying the cheating. She was trying to cover it up as much as he was and has to share in the consequences of her actions. On top of that, the neighbors that knew of the cheating are just as guilty for not standing up and saying anything before that.", "I completely agree she deserves those names she earned it with her cold cruel selfish actions\n\nHonestly jenny was jealous of op's mother and out of that jealousy she decided to sleep with her husband because she thought she would be able to steal him away and take OP 's youngest brother and have the family she never had because she was so focus on her best friend life\n\nAlso Jenny is not mad with OP she is mad because like most mistresses find out their AP never was going to leave their family and all they were was just somebody thy could sleep with and all the promises were lies and the feelings false.
