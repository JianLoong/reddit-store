I thought I would never date again. I saw it as a betrayal to my husband. My husband\u2019s mother and I became closer because of this shared grief. She encouraged me to start dating again after some time passed and eventually I met Sean. Sean and I fit together well. I sometimes wonder if my husband arranged for us to meet. We\u2019ve been married for 3 months. My mother in law took part in the wedding planing and was the one to walk me down the aisle. My parents and I are no contact and she stepped up. I appreciate this. We celebrated my birthday earlier this week and I had both my second mother in law (current husband\u2019s mom) and my first mother in law in attendance. When I introduced the two of them my second mother in law seemed confused as to why I introduced the two of them by the same title. I explained it to her and she seemed to get it.\n\nLater on though, she and Sean spoke to me about it and informed me that they didn\u2019t like it. Sean said it made it seem as if I was still married to my ex and hadn\u2019t let go of him yet. My second mother in law said that it was just flat out disrespectful to her because someone cannot have two mother in laws (?) she also thinks I haven\u2019t come to terms with the loss of my husband and takes offense to my \u201crefusal to accept myself as a member of their family\u201d. I asked them why they didn\u2019t mention this during wedding planning and Sean claims it\u2019s because he expected it to stop after.

This is a VERY common situation where a widow(er) remarries but remains close with their late spouse's parents.  Pretty common as well in divorce situations. Perfectly okay to have two sets of in-laws in this situation.   Its starting to sound like your new set of in-laws aren't as pleasant to be around as your first set.", "NTA. They\u2019re both being completely obtuse. Your first husband passed away, you didn\u2019t divorce him. His family is still your family. Your current husband knew this the whole time.\n\nIt may not be conventional, but it\u2019s totally reasonable. Your new MIL sounds pretty miserable for centering herself so much. You can have multiple people be part of your life at the same time\u2026\n\nYou will never fully let go of your first marriage, but that doesn\u2019t mean you love Sean less.

Remarrying doesn't change that. You're not disrespecting anyone. Hubby and Mil 2 should respect that.", "NTA. I still call my deceased husbands family my in-laws. Nobody else defines your relationship with anyone else. Nip this in the bud immediately", "NTA. Family is chosen, and you have chosen each other as part of the grief process. If it makes your other MiL incomfortable/jealous, then it's on her and your current husband, not on you.", "You didn't separate from her son or divorce him, your first marriage ended because he died. It's wonderful that you bonded with her and Sean knew this coming in. He can't expect you to change overnight. NTA.", "NTA.  It's your term of endearment for her.  Be warned they are going to want you to cut contact with her and get rid of anything to do with your deceased husband.  You can't have something that reminds you of him since this would be \"disrespectful\" to your new husband.  They really would like it also if you would never speak of the marriage before and please cut all contacts with friends from that time.", "NTA. Extended families come in all shapes, sizes, and names. My exe\u2019s family still call me BIL/SIL. My new wife\u2019s family call me the same. When they were alive, both of HER exe\u2019s in-laws did it too.

He died. You didn't divorce. If Sean felt this way he should have said something long ago...like before even proposing to you. No matter what.... Your first husband....IS your first husband. And yes I said IS not WAS. There is no changing that. There will always be a place in your heart for him. You will always have your shared life and memories. Sean, and frankly his Mom, are equating \"letting go\" with erasing him out of your life. That is not the same thing. That is not how that works.\n\nSean should have spoken up long ago.\nIt's up to you to decide what you want. You can keep referring to MIL...or come up with a different explanation or name .... That rests with you....what are you wanting to say , or not say, and how your mil wants to be addressed.\n\nA friend of mine went through similar situation. She started referring to her SIL and MIL as \" my deceased partners sister/mother who will always be my family\"... ( Basically when she got engaged,her soon to be in-law and relatives wanted her to drop her SIL/mil/nieces etc.....That's didn't go over well and he ex decided to spew a bunch of not nice things including he doesn't matter anymore...which led to him being her ex now.", "NTA: that is her correct title, but even if it wasn\u2019t, you have defined your relationship, it\u2019s what works for you", "I have a friend who remarried when her first husband died young.

Many people are fortunate to have found family either instead of or in addition to their own. You and her son did not choose to separate, his death does not make you less her family and she yours. \n\n\nI think that someone should have given new MIL a heads up because I can understand her being surprised or taken aback if she had no warning and suddenly her son's wife shows up with an ex's parents and maybe a warning convo that explains that you are not close to your family and this woman is family to you regardless of the marriage being over. You lost your husband, there is no reason you needed to lose your family, too.", "NTA \n\nWhat?  \n\nYou called her you MIL from Day 1.

Do they now just think you\u2019ve forgotten about him and don\u2019t care about him anymore? That\u2019s an unreasonable expectation. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t love someone else and be fully committed to them.

My grandmother considered her first mil her family and would visit her until my great grandmothers death in 2001.  The idea that people stop being your family when there is divorce or death is ridiculous.  If you have a good relationship with your first mil then that is awesome.", "NTA- but maybe it's appropriate to just call her your mom.", "NTA at all, but maybe it is time to call MIL 1 just Mom. She seems to be the one who is there for you.", "NTA. But why not just call your OG MIL, Mom? And then your husband's mom can be your MIL.

Families can be weird and complicated things. Frankly I think it'd be hilarious to have like MIL-1 and MIL-2 or something. But people can be sensitive. Unless you have some special attachment to the term, I think coming up with a new one for MIL-1 would be warranted and let MIL-2 rule the MIL hill.", "You are still married to your former husband so therefore she is still your mother in law. Therefore NTA", "Info: why do you still call her mother in law? On the surface it does seem like you aren\u2019t letting go of your first husband because at this point \u201cmother in law\u201d doesnt describe your relationship.

I have had an extreme amount of loss in my life and have quickly learned that family is not limited to blood relations. So here is my take SHE IS YOUR FAMILY. They do not get to decide that for you. If they are upset with her title FINE. From now on she is no longer your former MIL she is now just YOUR MOM. She has done all the things a good mom does for their adult child. She helped you through a major loss, was a major part of the planning process in a significant life event, and you asked her to represent your family unit when you asked her to escort you down the aisle. Now if their problem is having her in your life AT ALL then it is not too late to get an annulment. Honestly, your husband making this couple decision WITH HIS MOTHER instead of you would have me running for the hills.", "NTA, you're hurting literally no one by having two MILs.", "Sean is a mama's boy. He didn't mention it during the wedding planning because he didn't care until his mama got in his ear. Your first MIL was and is and should remain your MIL. This isn't a contest.

Just like attorneys general.  But, absolutely, you are close to your old mother in law, she isn\u2019t an ex, technically former, I guess, but there is no reason to not keep calling her that.  When you marry someone, you marry their history, too.  A widow doesn\u2019t have an ex husband, she has her dead husband.  Just because you are over his death, doesn\u2019t mean you have forgotten him, nor that you have blocked his family.

She's not a MIL anymore because the marriage was 'til death do you part' and there's been death.
