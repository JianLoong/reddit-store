My family is lower middle class so it was quite a change.\n\nI have two kids (6f and 4m) that get more or less anything they want. But they aren\u2019t spoiled.\n\nAnyways, we decided to spend Christmas with my family and the day before Christmas Day (since my dad worked the actual day), my mom calls all the kids to the tree for presents and did her usual \u201cyou guys were so good and that\u2019s why santa gave you all these things\u201d speech. After that, all of them quickly found theirs but my two kids kept searching and couldn\u2019t find anything. My son was on the verge of tears and my daughter was quiet after the tree was cleared and they were left with nothing. \n\nI asked my mom what was going on and my mom looked at me then at my kids and went \u201cOops! I thought you knew. We all decided that we weren\u2019t buying them Christmas gifts.\u201d\n\nI asked her why and she said that they get more than they need from me and my in laws and that they all collectively decided to spend more on those that need it. She looked at my son who had tears running down his face and said \u201cSee, look at how spoiled he is, this is good for them.\u201c \n\nShe then walked away. I quietly went back to the guest room and packed our things. I then called my husband who had offered to go grab my mom something from Walmart and told him to leave the stuff and come pick us up. \n\nWe then left quietly after I let my dad know. He was disappointed but said he understood. \n\nWe managed to cheer the kids up and visited my in laws instead. A while later I got a call from my mother.\n\nShe kept asking me why I disappeared like that and said that she was waiting for the stuff my husband was bringing from Walmart.\n\nI told her VERY POLITELY that I didn\u2019t like what she did to my children and that she or literally anyone else could\u2019ve AT LEAST told me. My mom said I was acting very entitled for someone who goes on multiple vacations a year. She then brought up my son crying again. I got pissed and told her that the reason he cried is because of her stupid speech about only good kids getting presents. My mom then randomly said that maybe he isn\u2019t a good kid if he cried like that over not getting toys. We argued back and forth over this but then I ended up saying that she\u2019s very lucky I didn\u2019t snatch back the gifts I bought for my nieces/nephew. My mom just said \u201cthe entitlement!\u201d before hanging up. \n\nMy sister texted me the same thing and my other sister said that I\u2019m playing the victim when the real victims are them and their kids. My mom sent a similar text as well. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nGot the day wrong. It was the day before-not actually Christmas Day. My bad, its been a couple days.

To see your grandchild crying after saying only good kids get presents & then call him spoiled. Wow. What a fucking shitty ass grandma. Op your whole family sucks.", "NTA\u2014but your MIL is!  It\u2019s just heartbreaking to hear so many stories where misguided people chose Christmas to passive-aggressively express their feelings about adult issues by denying  gifts to innocent little children.  If you don\u2019t like who your adult child chooses to love, or how they raise their kids, how they are positioned financially or whether they are biologically related to you\u2014there are 364 other days in the year to communicate this amongst adults.    \n\n\nYour MIL needs to grow up and stop acting out like a petulant toddler.  I think going forward I would gift her only \u201dreason for the season\u201d  type gifts, until she gets the message that Christmas is about love, acceptance and tolerance\u2014and not the time to exclude any child because of displeasure with their parents.", "NTA\n\nYour family feels that if they can\u2019t have it, no one should. And also feel entitled to treating your kids like crap. Awful.", "Hopping on the top comment.\n\nOP. your mom sounds like my mom, who once literally got me coal for Christmas. Years later, when I was in my twenties, she bought my brothers and I a toolkit. My older and younger brother got the 100-piece toolkit, and I got the 50 piece toolkit. When I asked why I got the smaller one she said \"Well you're gay, you don't use tools!\" Then she said \"Plus, you've never asked us for money so we figured you could buy it yourself if you *really* needed it.\"\n\nI've been NC with her for about three years now and they've been the most peaceful holidays I've ever had in my life.\n\nNTA! I'm so sorry for your kids.", "Happy cake day", "This. Her family is mean and jealous. They hurt the kids on purpose. That would be it for me. Awful.", "That had to be on purpose right? There\u2019s no way this didn\u2019t cross my mother\u2019s mind?\n\nAnd gosh if I knew... let\u2019s just say the situation would be very different.", "You're right. Even worse is that they were all in on this mean stunt to hurt OPs children in front of their cousins and the entire family. I can only imagine the hateful conversations they have about her behind her back.", "My son is really affected by this and bursts into tears every time he thinks he\u2019s done something wrong. He\u2019s also constantly apologizing for everything and anything. It\u2019s heartbreaking but my husband and I are dealing with it.\n\nAs for going no contact, consider it done. Everyone on that side has been blocked, minus my dad, but if he even tries to bother me he\u2019s getting blocked too.", "YUP.  As you said OP,  the LEAST mom could've done is to warn you that this would be happening, so you could've planned accordingly (ie told your kids that this has nothing to do with them being good or bad and perhaps gotten them something to open along with the others).  I agree - this has envy written all over it, including the constant comments on the kids being \"spoiled\" and your level of \"entitlement.\"  NTA", "My son gets excited over little toy cars you can buy for under 10 dollars at gas stations. My daughter has a large set of dolls. Some of them are admittedly very expensive and some of them are cheap-she loves each and every one dearly. They don\u2019t know the difference. I thought that maybe since they were getting a shit load of presents later anyways, I did maybe overreact but it was cruel. Very cruel.", "Winner winner.", "Definitely cutting them out. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to forgive them. My son is still so so sad and although my daughter doesn\u2019t really act like she cares, it affected her too. \n\nI feel sorry for my dad too. He works a lot and barely managed to get this day off (note how he couldn\u2019t get Christmas Day off) and it was ruined. He wasn\u2019t in on it so I\u2019m not as angry at him. My mom usually buys presents from the both of them.", "Victims of not being in the best spot financially.\n\nAlso that\u2019s fair, that was pretty ew of me. The anger got the best of me there. I adore my nieces and nephew and thinking back, I shouldn\u2019t have said that.", "Nope I would have certainly taken back every gift I brought for every person.", "Yeah I didn\u2019t understand grabbing something from Walmart.  Maybe they didn\u2019t celebrate Christmas Day??  Since Walmart was closed Christmas Day.", "My husband went to Walmart to grab my mom milk (and some other groceries) since one of my nieces accidentally knocked it all over.\n\nAnd we were always going to visit the in laws, who had their own presents as well as the presents my husband and I got our kids.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Being gay means that you never have to assemble anything or nothing breaks?? Where can I sign up?!? Who knew!\n\nI am glad you\u2019ve found some peace.", "And honestly, if she felt your children already gets expensive things because of your FIL having money then she still could have gotten them some cheap but fun things. Your kids are fairly young so it's not like she needed to spend hundreds of dollars on them if she felt that money could do better going to her other grandkids. But getting them a few toys so \"Santa\" still looked like he remembered them would have made all the difference in the world here. \n\n(Also, a child crying because they think Santa refused to give them anything because they were bad does NOT make them spoiled, your mother has some gall...)", "Agreed that this had to be on purpose. They didn\u2019t tell you bc your sisters didn\u2019t want to lose the presents you bought for their kids. Unfortunately your mother and sisters sound jealous of your life and family. NC for the moment is best. NTA \n\nP.S. Glad you were able to stop your husband from getting the Wal-Mart stuff. Sounds like she was more upset about that then y\u2019all actually leaving. If anyone is entitled, it\u2019s them.", "I agree it had to be, she knew exactly what she was doing. Your poor kids, that would have traumatised me as a child. Santa is basically a god figure for young children, I would have been crushed to think he didn't  like me.", "Your mother and sisters are jealous and probably feel insecure that you married into a wealthy family. They were effectively punishing you by treating your kids this way and all this is because of their own hang ups. \n\nI could never imagine treating a kid like this, let alone my own grandchildren. Last Christmas we had unexpected guests with kids come. We only found out a few days before. You better believe we made sure they had something to open during our Christmas celebration. \n\nThey did this out of spite. It\u2019s fucking gross that they decided to take this out on your kids and if I were you I would never speak to them again.", "Info how would you have reacted if your mom did have the conversation with you beforehand?  Would you have thrown a fit and threatened not to buy presents for any of the other kids or would you have understood her point of view and brought something for them to open from Santa", "Your mother is jealous. Her behavior was atrocious and it is all out of jealousy for material things and vacations. I\u2019m glad you are going NC. Her behavior won\u2019t change and at least you can give yourself and your family some peace.", "I\u2019m so sad for your kids. This is not \u201centitlement\u201d. This is not making your child feel like they were bad. I cannot believe how horrible this is.", "This might be the time to tell them Santa isn't real.  He's bursting into tears over an imaginary judgment of an imaginary man.  Your mom sucks.", "Spare your child from 'family' who have no care for his feelings. Today, tomorrow, always.\nNTA", "It really suck that he's so suck but you might need to tell him Santa doesn't exist to not affect his self estime...\nOr another commenter said to say Santa made an error and delivered the gifts at the wrong adress. Give them new gifts with a letter from Santa apologyzing and that he knows they are very good kids.", "Glad you're going NC. If your family wants to be jealous that's one thing. But taking it out on your kids then pretending to be so nonchalant about excluding your children is unhinged. Also like one comment mentioned, might as well come clean about Santa. Let your kids know the Grinch is really though and that they didn't do anything wrong.", "Please get your son into therapy. This event will already be engrained in his soul, you don\u2019t want low self-esteem and an extreme need to please others to ruin his future.", "Big brain op!", "Did you set your kids straight that your mom doesn't speak for Santa?", "With all due respect, your mother is so salty. The basis of her argument is that your kids get gifts from the you regardless so they shouldn\u2019t get any from their own grandparents? That is so ignorant. Do your nephews and nieces get presents from their parents?", "Wait, why are you angry at your dad at all?", "You shouldn\u2019t forgive them. What they did is unforgivable. It wasn\u2019t some accident or quick bad decision. This was discussed between them, planned and delivered over several days and most likely weeks beforehand.  There would have been plenty time for one or more of them to come to their senses.  Message your mum and sisters telling them what there Is no coming back from what they did and it is your last contact with them, copy the link to this thread if you like, then block them all except your dad, but tell him he has not to be the \u201cinbetween \u201c communication for your mum.", "Very sad to hear about how your children have been affected by this. Could you do something like having them find a present on their bed/beneath your tree and tell them Santa was just late because of a storm? Something of the sort so that they no longer think they\u2019re \u201cbad\u201d. Poor kids. Good on you for going NC tbh", "Well, they're professional victims, and from what I hear that line of work doesn't pay very well.", "That\u2019s why my vote is ESH for your mom not even having a conversation with you about it and for hurting her grandkids and you for what you said and honestly for threatening to take back your nieces and nephews gifts. You don\u2019t threaten to punish kids for adult actions.  Your mom did this not the kids.", "I have a different definition of the word victim.  And still you are not responsible for them feeling that way about where they are in life financially.  And of course mama bear comes out when you saw your children needlessly hurt.  From the outside looking in they ambushed you.  Even waited for your husband to be out of the house before commencing the gift opening.  I wish you well in the new year and that after tempers have cooled that some communication can happen to resolve issues or having your mom hear how much this hurt, not just your kids but you as well.  I can't imagine my mother hurting her grandkids like this.", "Thanks for pointing this out. It is in fact closed on the day. My dad worked Christmas Day so we opened presents the morning before. It\u2019s been a couple days so I got the dates mixed up.", "[deleted]", "i literally said \u201cwell, that\u2019s homophobic,\u201d when it happened and mom was like \u201cno, i\u2019ve never seen you fix anything\u201d. \n\nthen i was like \u201cif i never use tools, why did you get me them?\u201d \n\n\u201cwe got you all the same thing\u201d\n\n\u201cno you didn\u2019t, you got me the 50-piece set.\u201d\n\n\u201cyeah, because you never use tools.\u201d \n\ni just realized we were going in circles. i finally just left.", "I mean Play-Doh is pretty cheap. Ten dollars at the dollar store will get you a few things.  This was entirely to prove a point to OP and darn the child-hurtibg consequences.", "Unfortunately I agree. He needs a conversation that this was grandma that did this and it has nothing to do with how he acted. They obviously weren\u2019t from Santa because it was Christmas Eve and grandma was trying to copy him.", "6 is still young and it just breaks my heart that her cruel mom may have ruined the magic of Santa. He\u2019s at an age that the belief could have continued a couple of years longer.", "I disagree. Since /u/throwaway377301 doesn't appear to have financial troubles, I would buy an additional gift from Santa for both kids, and put it next to the chimney with a note from Santa on January 6th. The note should say that OP's kids were on the good list, but Grandma hid the gifts he delivered with Rudolph, so she is going on the naughty list and getting coal next year. It took a bit to get here from the North Pole again, so he delivered another set of gifts on January 6th, as that is when Christmas is celebrated in Eastern Europe. Please don't question yourself and don't be mad at Santa.", "I\u2019m confused? We gave the gifts for my nieces and nephew a couple days prior.", "Ahhhh that's a good work around!  It was Christmas eve, so clearly it wasn't Santa!", "This is what needs to happen. Tell him that sometimes people are mean, just like grandma pretending to be santa and not getting him or his sister a present. Such a nasty, jealous, mean-spirited thing to do.", "The son is 4. Far too young to ruin it for him", "There is nearly always a workaround! I hate when people use Santa as the actual \u201cbeing good\u201d thing. My kids worry about that too and I ask them, did you try this year? Everyone makes mistakes. Unfortunately grandmas was so big I bet Santa left coal everywhere for her.", "Ah I misread which kid was which age. That just makes it so much worse."]}
