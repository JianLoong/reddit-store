My family is lower middle class so it was quite a change.\n\nI have two kids (6f and 4m) that get more or less anything they want. But they aren\u2019t spoiled.\n\nAnyways, we decided to spend Christmas with my family and the day before Christmas Day (since my dad worked the actual day), my mom calls all the kids to the tree for presents and did her usual \u201cyou guys were so good and that\u2019s why santa gave you all these things\u201d speech. After that, all of them quickly found theirs but my two kids kept searching and couldn\u2019t find anything. My son was on the verge of tears and my daughter was quiet after the tree was cleared and they were left with nothing. \n\nI asked my mom what was going on and my mom looked at me then at my kids and went \u201cOops! I thought you knew. We all decided that we weren\u2019t buying them Christmas gifts.\u201d\n\nI asked her why and she said that they get more than they need from me and my in laws and that they all collectively decided to spend more on those that need it. She looked at my son who had tears running down his face and said \u201cSee, look at how spoiled he is, this is good for them.\u201c \n\nShe then walked away. I quietly went back to the guest room and packed our things. I then called my husband who had offered to go grab my mom something from Walmart and told him to leave the stuff and come pick us up. \n\nWe then left quietly after I let my dad know. He was disappointed but said he understood. \n\nWe managed to cheer the kids up and visited my in laws instead. A while later I got a call from my mother.\n\nShe kept asking me why I disappeared like that and said that she was waiting for the stuff my husband was bringing from Walmart.\n\nI told her VERY POLITELY that I didn\u2019t like what she did to my children and that she or literally anyone else could\u2019ve AT LEAST told me. My mom said I was acting very entitled for someone who goes on multiple vacations a year. She then brought up my son crying again. I got pissed and told her that the reason he cried is because of her stupid speech about only good kids getting presents. My mom then randomly said that maybe he isn\u2019t a good kid if he cried like that over not getting toys. We argued back and forth over this but then I ended up saying that she\u2019s very lucky I didn\u2019t snatch back the gifts I bought for my nieces/nephew. My mom just said \u201cthe entitlement!\u201d before hanging up. \n\nMy sister texted me the same thing and my other sister said that I\u2019m playing the victim when the real victims are them and their kids. My mom sent a similar text as well. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nGot the day wrong. It was the day before-not actually Christmas Day. My bad, its been a couple days.

Don\u2019t share info directly with them as far as your vacations, purchases, job promotions, what gifts your children received for any occasion, etc. Yes it makes for shorter and possibly boring conversations with your family but that will be their problem.  If they find out stuff from postings and ask you can just demure by saying you are sure they would be bored by you discussing it so don\u2019t. \n\nYou and your husband might also want to revisit what you are spending on your family.

For full experience, you can present them with the gifts face to face as it is not a tradition here to put them under the tree (that's done on New Year's Day).", "Maybe OPs father didn\u2019t want to start an argument and escalate a climate of discord during a family celebration while a child was already crying and OP and her mother were being tense with each other. \nPerhaps it has to do with OPs father\u2019s dynamic with her mother, maybe he\u2019s the avoidant or the henpecked type, who knows. He did the right thing by not starting an argument on Christmas eve in front of children and other family members.", "IKEA only requires Allen wrenches for assembly!

I also guess this isn\u2019t the first time the mother has pulled weird antics like this. As the adult child of a narcissistic mother and an enabler father I feel like it was my dads place to help protect us from my mothers antics and instead he didn\u2019t wanna rock the boat and just let her treat us however. It changed our relationship the more I noticed this. He\u2019s to blame also.", "What does that have to do with my question. ETA not for nothing OP threatened to do the same thing.

When we came back from winter break he told us he was sad because his mom skipped her scheduled visit and he didn\u2019t get any gifts from Santa but all the other kids did. Our lead teacher called his foster mother and she admitted they got him NOTHING. She said, \u201cIf his mom wanted him to have presents she should\u2019ve brought him some.\u201d Their kids got gifts from Santa while he sat and watched.\n\nThen lead teacher called his social worker to complain about this obvious abuse and the social worker said \u201cWell, they\u2019re not required to love him.\u201d\n\nThat sweet boy was FOUR. \n\nHe\u2019s the reason I decided to foster parent (in the future; I was too young and not ready then or I would\u2019ve offered to take him). No kid deserves that treatment, but especially not one already suffering the trauma of being removed from his horrible parents. \n\nAnd we made sure in our classroom there was not going to be any lessons about Santa bringing gifts to all the GOOD children.", "Oh yes, there is always a workaround.  When my kids were very young my psycho ex left (thankfully) so money was a bit tight.  The kids knew we didn\u2019t have much money but thought Christmas presents wouldn\u2019t be a problem because Santa brought them.  My \u201cworkaround\u201d was to tell them that parents had to give Santa money for the stuff he brought so that was why rich kids got more than poor kids.  As long as they still believed in Santa they thought he was a bit of a con man, which was better than them thinking they weren\u2019t good enough to get all the things they wanted.", "Well tbh your question is completely irrelevant to the AITA soooo\u2026.

Poor little boy\u2026 Thankful that you opened your heart and home to foster children. There are so many needy kids that deserve all the love. \n\nOP - you are NTA.
