{"id": 6285, "submission_id": "101btpz", "title": "AITA for being upset that my family didn\u2019t get my kids Christmas presents?", "selftext": "I married into a wealthy family. My family is lower middle class so it was quite a change.\n\nI have two kids (6f and 4m) that get more or less anything they want. But they aren\u2019t spoiled.\n\nAnyways, we decided to spend Christmas with my family and the day before Christmas Day (since my dad worked the actual day), my mom calls all the kids to the tree for presents and did her usual \u201cyou guys were so good and that\u2019s why santa gave you all these things\u201d speech. After that, all of them quickly found theirs but my two kids kept searching and couldn\u2019t find anything. My son was on the verge of tears and my daughter was quiet after the tree was cleared and they were left with nothing. \n\nI asked my mom what was going on and my mom looked at me then at my kids and went \u201cOops! I thought you knew. We all decided that we weren\u2019t buying them Christmas gifts.\u201d\n\nI asked her why and she said that they get more than they need from me and my in laws and that they all collectively decided to spend more on those that need it. She looked at my son who had tears running down his face and said \u201cSee, look at how spoiled he is, this is good for them.\u201c \n\nShe then walked away. I quietly went back to the guest room and packed our things. I then called my husband who had offered to go grab my mom something from Walmart and told him to leave the stuff and come pick us up. \n\nWe then left quietly after I let my dad know. He was disappointed but said he understood. \n\nWe managed to cheer the kids up and visited my in laws instead. A while later I got a call from my mother.\n\nShe kept asking me why I disappeared like that and said that she was waiting for the stuff my husband was bringing from Walmart.\n\nI told her VERY POLITELY that I didn\u2019t like what she did to my children and that she or literally anyone else could\u2019ve AT LEAST told me. My mom said I was acting very entitled for someone who goes on multiple vacations a year. She then brought up my son crying again. I got pissed and told her that the reason he cried is because of her stupid speech about only good kids getting presents. My mom then randomly said that maybe he isn\u2019t a good kid if he cried like that over not getting toys. We argued back and forth over this but then I ended up saying that she\u2019s very lucky I didn\u2019t snatch back the gifts I bought for my nieces/nephew. My mom just said \u201cthe entitlement!\u201d before hanging up. \n\nMy sister texted me the same thing and my other sister said that I\u2019m playing the victim when the real victims are them and their kids. My mom sent a similar text as well. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nGot the day wrong. It was the day before-not actually Christmas Day. My bad, its been a couple days. My dad worked Christmas Day so we opened presents the day before.\n\nOkay just to clarify:\n\n1. The presents my husband and I got our kids were at our in laws since we were going there after a while anyways.\n\n2. We told my in laws what happened and they got some extra things to cheer them up. Getting their presents cheered my daughter up. It cheered my son up as well but the speech my mom gave seems to be bothering him still.\n\n3. I\u2019ve been using \u201cSanta wasn\u2019t done delivering presents\u201d which again, seems to have mostly worked since they did eventually get things but I will be doing what a few people suggested about Santa apologizing and reassuring my kids that they were never on the naughty list.

It's not about the gift, it's about the intention. It's not like the 4&6 year olds were gonna sit there and do the math.", "I'm sure the other children weren't in on this, though. Let's not hold children accountable for bad things their parents do. Children are not their parents, after all.", "And the grandma about to start off the whole \"boys don't cry\" speech.

I'm super obliteratingly amazingly extra gay (trans man, prefers men, in a relationship with another trans man so even if we had to both be called women we'd still be lesbian/gay), and I own *so many tools*. Hand tools, machine tools, even several 3D printers and laser cutters that I use as tools or to make more tools or to fix tools. All of my hobbies involve tools.

It's always fun to learn about other traditions. :)", "Thank you. I'm very lucky both of my boys are awesome little people. It's hard because I don't want my boys to resent them but I'm not going to facilitate them being hurt either. My boys started football and gymnastics this year and any time the IL's went it was focused on SILs kids being all over and not listening. They say thanks for coming but I always ask if they want me to invite them and it's usually \"it's okay\" because it's not allowed to be their thing. Luckily my family are always there cheerleading for them so that's the silver lining I guess.

I miss him so much.", "I agree!!!", "You know\u2026.. we never actually established that. \ud83e\udd23 an excellent question!", "I know. Just meant in general, for full experience. One fun thing we have is that the first person to enter the house (outside of the family) on Christmas day is treated like royalty.", "Sorry, you shouldn't be using tools as a straight female, you'll do yourself harm, best give them to your husband who knows how to use them properly.\nSpend that time usefully in the kitchen instead./s", "Thank you!", "My parents never got the pleasure of meeting my fiancee - but I know they would have loved the stuffing out of her.

I love it though bc keeps me from buying it and knowing it freaks out coworkers that he buys it for us and we love it is great.", "Exactly, this is abusive behavior.  Mental abuse is just as destructive as physical abuse.  Time to go NC.  I had to do this with my family to protect my daughter from my sister and Mom.  My other sister just said \"she will be old enough in a few years to defend herself so then you guys can come back around\"  WTF, my daughter should not have to get old enough to defend herself against family.  They are so used to abuse, they don't understand and don't blame the abusers.  It is sad because in order to get away from the abuse I had to also cutout people I love and miss.", "Yes, this was psychological sadism. She wanted to get even with the mother but got a greater stimulation from doing it to the children.", "Exactly what I was thinking. I can roll into a dollar store and get at least 4 presents for each of them for under $20, and they're so young they would have a blast. Coloring books, markers, craft items are so cheap.

It isn\u2019t fair is it? So much love to you my new friend!", "We did buy him some special things (including clean clothes with cool characters on them) but most of it stayed at school and were things he could wear or play with or eat when not at home, since they would take anything he brought home; even clothes and underwear we bought him, they gave to their \u201creal\u201d kids and would send him into school in dirty, often soiled clothes. \n\nHow they didn\u2019t lose their foster license with all the BS they were reported for I\u2019ll never understand. But then, I also reported a disabled girl\u2019s father for suspected sexual abuse, then found out teachers and therapists had already been reporting the same behavior for years, and it still took DCF three more years to remove her from his home, by which time she was 17 and the abuse was undeniable, so I don\u2019t think too highly of social services in that particular area.", "Reality shouldn't be so harsh in 4 short years. That poor kid.", "You did not over react at all. Your mom was deliberately cruel you your young children. What you did, by leaving, is protect them from further abuse throughout the day. Imagine if you had stayed. From the way your sisters reacted I can imagine the cousins would have been encouraged to bully your kids because they got presents and your kids didn\u2019t.

I have legit thought, 'That's a fallback job if I ever need it' because I am the IKEA assembler for my whole family.", "I am always delighted to share One Simple Wish (https://www.onesimplewish.org) with the world. Social workers submit wishes for children in care or for youth who have exited foster care without a supportive family (\"aged out\"). The wishes for younger kids are usually \"wants\" like a special toy, sports team jersey, bicycle, etc. Young adults usually ask for a mix of wants (video games,  etc) and needs (laptop for college, bike to get to work, furnishings for new apartment, etc). Either the kids or their social workers send a thank you note. \n\nA similar org is Alice's Kids (https://aliceskids.org/about/our-story/), whose mission is to provide kids whose families can't provide a lot/any \"wants\" with a special gift to improve their self-esteem and support the whole family. For AK, teachers or social workers nominate the kids, then the gift is given to the parent or carer, so the parent gets to be the \"hero\" for the kid. It was founded by two siblings in honor of the phenomenal effort their mother put in to get them extras like a baseball glove or new shoes: \"To this day, we recall the exhilarating feeling of getting onto the school bus wearing new clothes or sporting a new haircut...In the grand scheme of things, these items were not as important as food and shelter but they lifted our spirits and made us feel more \u201cnormal\u201d among our classmates.\" \n\nNot a shill for either of these places, but I think they resonate with me bc they acknowledge that receiving or not receiving special gifts, no matter how modest, matters to children, and they think we should build children up, rather than torment them at Christmas.", "\u201cGet more than they need\u201d \n\nGifts aren\u2019t supposed to be about what you need as a recipient.

Not only was she trying to break a four year old\u2019s heart but she was vindicated when she succeeded. She wanted to pass moral judgement on your babies and make them believe they were bad kids on Christmas simply because your family has more wealth than your sisters. My goodness. There is nothing a 4 and 6 year old could do to deserve that. Given your husband was going out to help her at this time (maybe on purpose so he\u2019d be removed for her to pull off her little plan?) and you were SO INSANELY gentle and polite I\u2019m going out on a limb to say you are the good/ignored child and these problems all stem from your unhinged mother.
