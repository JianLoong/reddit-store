Speaking from experience. I temporarily lived with my friend who was a first time mom and she was the kind who could sleep through most things. She wasn't used to waking up several times in the middle of the night because her baby woke up screaming. So most of the time, by the time she woke up, my sleep would be interrupted too. Sometimes I had to physically wake her up (because the baby would be hungry and she didn't do bottled milk so there was only one way to feed the baby). I was sleep deprived and I wasn't even the baby's parent. \nSo in this post, I don't see any AH. The wife is exhausted from having to take care of a newborn most of the day and night but I doubt OP is getting much sleep himself.", "It is terrible, my abusive ex husband didn't let me sleep  normally and it was hell. In the end i begged him just to let me sleep one hour please. I still don't know if the punching was worse or the lack of sleep. For sure it was a torture.", "Unless your baby has a lot of cholics I would chose baby to work every time...\n\nMy baby after the initial 4 weeks where he needed to get the weight back on, would easily sleep 6-7 hours, we kinda forced him to very regular schedules in those initial weeks and it was a breeze after. \n\n10/10 would do it again of it wasn't for the not getting paid part.", "There is something to be learned here.

If she gets sick again so soon, please don't be surprised.", "Mild YTA. You should have asked \"do you mind if I take a nap?\" She doesn't have the luxury of just taking a nap, so it's not really fair to just leave her with an extended shift while you get to rest. \n\nThis time period is exhausting for everyone but let's remember that producing breastmilk, in and of itself, not even including the act of feeding, uses \u00bc of the body's daily energy and being a SAHP is the equivalent of 2.5 full-time jobs and research puts it at a 98 hr work week.", "Soft YTA \n\nIt would have been pretty easy to shoot her a text or walk down and have a quick chat with her.

She did not sleep well probably for most of the pregnancy because she woke up continuously to readjust and to go to the bathroom. \nShe just went through labor or a caesarean. She lost a ton of blood and water in that process. Since she is only 5 weeks pp she might even still be bleeding. It takes 2 months for blood to be fully restored. So that two month period is AFTER she stops bleeding. Meaning she\u2019s barely into the restoring process if she even is. On top of that her body is creating breastmilk, do you know how many calories that burns? 500-700 that\u2019s 30-45 mins of running at 11mph. So your wife is essentially working out every single day with absolutely no break days. Now she has a newborn and hasn\u2019t gotten a full night sleep for 5 weeks like you, but unlike you, you have to add in the time since she had a full night sleep during her pregnancy. So shes going months upon months. Add on top of that she\u2019s sick. You need more sleep when sick. Let\u2019s say she did take a nap when baby did, she most likely got woken up by the baby crying and had her nap interrupted. She was probably looking at the clock counting time till you got home and were able to take over for her for a second. While you got a break from work: driving to work, mandatory work break, and driving back home. Once you got home instead of talking to her, you went and took a shower and then laid down for a nap, while she was probably wondering what was taking you so long because she could use some help. You woke up after dinner was ready so she also did that all on her own while simultaneously taking care of baby. She is also dealing with hormones that are actually worse then when she was pregnant. They call it the 4th trimester for a reason. No you were not in the wrong for taking a nap. But considering she\u2019s healing, sick and she also just worked a full day taking care of baby and household she deserved a break or nap herself as soon as you walked through the door.", "Can you please find some help? Newborns so are much work and you are both exhausted. \n\nYTA for taking a nap without telling her, esp when the usual expectation is that you help in the evenings. \n\nYou both need rest.
