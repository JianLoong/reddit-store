She didn't ask for help early enough, so her 'ask' built up and came out explosively when she fiinally let it out.  You need to be fresh for work, but I would suggest you offer to take Friday and/or Saturday nights for her, every week, so that she can have at least one night a week where she gets to sleep through the night.  It won't feel like enough for her, and it will feel like too much for you, but frankly having a baby that won't sleep just fucking sucks and it's on you both to get through it.", "Nah both of you are sleep deprived and exhausted anyone saying Y T A and E S H are projecting there own problems", "You're both assholes. Raising a child isn't 50/50. It's 100/100. Sounds like the baby is the mature one in this scenario.", "NAH If you have family close, this is a good time to have them come over and play with the baby for a couple of hours while you both take a nap.", "NAH\n\nBabies are very difficult and you two will have more bickering arguments like this. I don't think there's a way to avoid them entirely--you're both exhausted and that's something you just have to kind of wait out until the kid gets older.", "NAH, but you should maybe establish communication with your wife. I only slept one hour last night due to childcare so we talked about and decided I would nap today when my mum visited to look after our eldest. Talking about things is good so nobody feels overwhelmed.", "NAH. This is life with a baby who doesn\u2019t sleep well. My first child was like this. We slept in shifts holding him all night for months. It sucked. It hurts in the moment and will pass. Stop worrying about judgement and just push through it. Maybe look at a parenting Reddit for support.", "NAH Welcome to parenthood. Give one and other some grace.", "Of y\u2019all though having a 5 week old baby is hard then good luck doing the same thing for many many years.. \neither way you\u2019re NTA because you both are tired and that gonna be like this for a long time now. So maybe try communicating like adults that just had a baby.", "NAH. Maybe ask for some help from someone you can trust so you can both can get some rest.", "NAH, you\u2019re both just tired and crabby", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to rest and be tired too.", "NAH both of you are tired and crabby and not being patient and empathic towards each others needs, more communication and understanding from both of you is needed.", "No one is an AH. Y\u2019all are exhausted. I had twins. I filled the schedule from the book Babywise.  Trust me, it works!", "NTA of course you were tired from working all day after being up most of the night.", "NAH. You\u2019re both hardworking and tired parents.", "NTA, but newborns are very exhausting. One thing new moms all seem to do is neglect their own health. At least once a day, your wife should be lying down to rest when the baby naps. She will argue that she doesn\u2019t have the time, but that little rest will be so beneficial she will be able to accomplish more throughout the day.", "NAH welcome to being a new parent where you\u2019re both exhausted, everybody needs a nap, and the household chores can wait a bit! Seriously, you both need to chill, understand your both sleep deprived and grouchy, try to be patient and understanding with each other instead of competing with who\u2019s got it worse today. Remember that every new parent goes through this exhausting phase, but it\u2019s temporary. It will get better. Don\u2019t let it wreck your relationship in the meantime", "Gonna be completely honest OP I think I saw the exact same post from your wife\u2019s POV and everyone was on her side except me and even now I\u2019m still on your side. This is rediculous", "This. OP now is the time for you both to be the most patient and forgiving you've EVER been with each other.\n\nEdited a typo", "Nothing tests a marriage like the arrival of a baby.", "This is usually the answer when you have parents of a tiny child posting. Even when one of them is being a jerk (not the circumstances here, though), it\u2019s in large part because everyone is just so exhausted.", "[removed]", "Agree, NAH. My husband and I made a rule that any fights we had while sleep deprived didn\u2019t count. You\u2019ll make it through, OP. Remember that the first three months are the most difficult, the \u201cfourth trimester.\u201d It\u2019ll even out.", " Communicate better, you're both exhausted. I love these posts, they remind me why I'm child-free. Communicate better, you're both exhausted. I love these posts, they remind me why I'm child-free.", "How does OPs wife suck?", "This!! Is like you count the minutes left to get a break and then\u2026 the break arrives and goes to nap without telling you? For me is just the fact that she didn\u2019t know he was napping, maybe she needed the baby to be cared for a couple minutes before that nap or something and then she would have been fine with it.", "And he woke up after dinner was all ready!", "working 8 hours on your feet all day after getting up all night to take care of a baby IS exhausting, don\u2019t do that. make it seem like he\u2019s being unreasonable. when i was 4 weeks postpartum and sick i still woke up to breastfeed my baby every time she needed it because that\u2019s what moms do, you don\u2019t get a day off with a newborn just because you\u2019re sick. and when my man rocked her to sleep for me or stayed up late to put her down and had to work the next day i could see how exhausted he was and would never yell at him for taking a nap or make him feel bad for being tired. a lot of people think you have to be up with the baby all day but newborn babies sleep 14-19 hours a day!!! i would say my man had it worse than me because i got to just chill while my daughter napped for hours on end. you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not the misery olympics and then tell him she has it worse. let\u2019s be understanding instead of putting fathers down for being tired. it\u2019s a team effort and both of them need the same amount of sleep and energy to do their daily duties.", "Really?  It was too complicated for her to go find him and see that he was asleep?  I suspect he just fell into the bed and went to sleep.", "If baby needs clean clothes or bottles or shit/spit up everywhere than she may have had to. There's a lot more that needs to happen now when a baby is in the mix than with just adults/older kids.", "An hour and a half is \"shirking the next day\"?", "I was wondering that - how does he think she'll get over the cold just from having half of a single night extra to rest? She had to then be \"on\" all day, even cooking dinner for them, while sick. Did he think she'd magically be cured after a single night?", "OP says that they split the overnight duties every night so they are both having interrupted sleep. She\u2019s not doing all the night care by herself.", "What\u2019s the deal with these women who don\u2019t work?", "And what happens if she falls asleep with baby? \n\nSomeone could die, way worse than getting fired.", "Have you birthed a human being?", "Absolutely. My uncle developed severe insomnia and suffered from it for years until he ended up taking his life last year. He had 3 kids that he loved dearly and never would have done that if the lack of sleep didn\u2019t absolutely fuck his mind", "[removed]", "Which is why I don\u2019t understand the mindset some people have that a baby can improve a relationship", "u/Agreeablobcat is a possible bot. Remarks taken from u/contessalynn_art.", "She called him a crybaby for being tired after working all day on no sleep. That\u2019s unnecessarily hostile. Working 8 hour retail shifts can be super draining as you\u2019re usually on your feet and interacting with customers the whole time.", "ESH. I think you need to work on communicating your needs to each other. That would solve all of this. \n\nOP if you simply said \u201cI\u2019m pretty exhausted after work and don\u2019t know that I can handle childcare without a quick nap. Mind if I take a shower and nap and then take over after dinner?\u201d It\u2019s likely that none of this would\u2019ve occurred. \n\nAlso I\u2019m assuming your wife still has a cold so being a little more understanding of her exhaustion would help. It sounds like you\u2019re both tired and both doing your best.", "YTA for not telling her.  That is unbelievably rude and inconsiderate. \nThere she was waiting for you to come out and help and you didn't even bother to go tell her you weren't going to.  She had to stop whatever she was doing and come look for your ass to make sure you hadn't died in the shower, and she finds you asleep.  She is right to be angry with you and you have some tall apologizing to do.", "Dude even took a short shower, but a shower and a nap? He could have let her know.", "She shouldn't have the, he is the one who changed the routine so should have told her\n\n>I suspect he just fell into the bed and went to sleep.\n\nNobody accidently falls into bed, he chose to go the bed instead of dealing with the baby", "There are also things that can be put off. Say it's mopping day, then it can be done a different day. The difference between the two is that it's a lot harder for him to put off his work duties than it is for her. Both have it rough in different ways. The only problem with this situation was communication. He should definitely be allowed to take a nap after taking ALL the nighttime duties, but he needed to communicate that it was what he needed before doing it. And she should respect that need for him. She got to sleep a solid night without major interruption. She should be more grateful.", "When you\u2019ve been looking after a 5wk old baby all day, whilst sick, then 1hr30, unexpected, is the equivalent of 24hrs. So yeah, it kinda is. All they had to do was say they needed a nap and it would be completely different, but instead they just didn\u2019t come down until dinner was conveniently made", "Nope.", "i mean if he gets fired from his job they might become accidently homeless though", "To each their own, dont care either way but if they wanted do that; that's their prerogative. Yeah that's just wishful thinking - babies (esp newborns) ain't hard to look after they asleep half the time. I would know. No you just do t like the fact I'm right and I'm not using soft language to boost or cater to your low confidence in yourself and capabilities as a mother lol. I would reccomend you to stop projecting yourself into this particular post and keep it moving otherwise I will make you look silly. Nope I shit on people if necessary dont care if you're a man or woman. Bs is Bs. Right is right & wrong is wrong. Simples (meerkat sound effect)", "Given today's political climate; maybe I have lmao. & what's that suppose to prove lol? - you do realise that all walks of life that are female give birth so stop making it look like you women are doing something  special or miraculous when it reality it just means your womb is working/functional - you wouldn't give credit to an female Dog, Lion or cat for giving birth so why do guys always want extra recognition? Gets annoying.", "An hour and a half nap vs. all the night duty is a pretty good trade off, but she wasn\u2019t expecting it. NAH, but sleep deprivation is the real a h. Let it go, no winners.", "It's called naivete.", "I also don\u2019t understand why people have kids so early too. It blows my mind. My hubby and have been together since we were about 20, even having kids two years in would have been a disaster! We barely could communicate properly. Lol. We were still idiot kids in some ways. \n\nThough OP here seems pretty awesome even checking whether they were the AH, honestly I would likely be trying and hopefully sleeping and not worrying about this kind of anxiety.", "Thank you!  That was some BS right there.", "Dang I missed that part", "Staying home with a baby is draining too but still think NAH", "Where does it say he got \"no sleep\"? He says he got up every time the baby needed him. That typically does not mean that he didn't sleep a wink in-between. It's possible, but unlikely, and he probably would have said if that was the way.", "Definitely going to trust your opinion, MagesticPenisMan. Thanks for mansplaining being a stay at home mother to me.", "True, these two need to communicate more to resolve issues. One day here or there is okay, but yes - repeated absences or sleeping at work is a problem of course.", "Yeah I think they\u2019re both just overtired.", "Lol ok, we'll go with that."]}
