I'm currently 21 weeks pregnant and I am extremely tired all the time (like I had no idea I could feel so exhausted and me and my fiance once went to the beach (a 9 hour drive there) after getting off work at 5 pm switched off driving  getting maybe 4 hours of sleep there each spent the day at the beach hiking shopping swimming then drove back the other 9 hours same day we arrived switched off with maybe 4 hours of sleep each again. And that didnt even compare to how i feel constantly now.

We're doing great but we also worked very very hard on our relationship and communication for years first. We'd have zero chance if we hadn't been in a strong position relationship-wise to begin with. Also my pregnancy and labour was very straightforward with no complications - I know those issues can strain the strongest relationships.", "Shoot. Mine is four now so we rarely have those late nights, but it does happen. I don\u2019t have the crippling exhaustion that a newborn brings, that was the most difficult time for me by far. \n\nIt\u2019s totally worth it. I hope one day soon you get the solid sleep you deserve!", "The point is if he isn't justified in his lapse in judgement due to sleep deprivation from helping her. (Also men can experience post partum as well. Not saying he is but hormones for both parents run wild after and during pregnancy.) Then she isn't justified for her malice. Ide go with NAH as long as both talked this out after", "She got to sleep last night. He didn't. She already has more sleep. Like your comment doesn't even make sense.", "So he gets a pass for being tired, he got some rest at her expense, but she doesn't get a pass? wtf?", "I would any day do an 8 hour retail shift over do an 8 hour baby, house chores, and making dinner shift.", "It's ESH then. She doesn't get off for insulting him", "She also shouldn't insult him and should be more understanding. This is an ESH at best. It's strange you think calling your partner a crybaby is okay.", "Has a cold and is post partum! That fourth trimester (or even entire first year) can bring even the strongest person and strongest relationship to its knees.\n\nShe's still recovering physically and her hormones are all over the place. I have never had any kind of anger issues in my life. I had legitimate rage issues in the fourth trimester.", "Yeah, but that's not the situation presented here, is it? She's obviously super pissed about the fact that he went to sleep. If it was enough of an issue to act like this this it was enough of an issue to wake him up.", "Technically speaking she changed the routine by him staying up all night to take care of the baby\u2026 and I\u2019ve seen it happen plenty of times where someone lies or sits down without the intention to nap and boom they fall asleep so I think bout your points are wrong here", "Lololol his intention was to rest a bit after being up all night with his child and then having to go work all morning to earn money for the family since he\u2019s the sole working parent. I get it\u2019s a shitty situation but maybe she should get a job and let him be a sahd if she\u2019s not thrilled with her roll", "What? Yeah, an unexpected 90 minutes is frustrating to someone tired, sick, and postpartum but in no way is it going to be the equivalent of a whole day, especially since OP did do their share afterwards. And I'm talking as someone who had to do several sudden \"hour and a half\" which was never just an hour and a half. Now my experience was with a premature baby so my experience with a 5-week-old is a little different from a full term baby but she still spent a lot of the day asleep.\n\nNow, I haven't forgotten that the wife is sick but she had a lot more chances to rest throughout the day compared to OP who was working *retail* after a night of solo baby duty. And as of right now, all OP had really said about the nap is that they stayed in the room and didn't say anything. I'm not saying they shouldn't have said anything, but they haven't said it wasn't a case of being so tired they fell asleep. We also don't know what other circumstances surrounds OP getting to and from where they work or what time they got home and what time they usually have dinner.", "Oh\u2026and one of you is going to have massive hormonal swings for months.\n\nHave fun!", "TBF there's a balance. The longer you wait, the older you are, the tireder you are.", "Yeah mine is almost two. It\u2019s better than when he was a newborn but the exhaustion is no joke. \n\nThanks you, so do I.", "I understand your point, but my point was that thinking of it only in terms of sleep deprivation is oversimplifying what she is going through at 5 weeks pp.\n\nI have no doubt that the transition to parenthood is rough on men too. Of course it is, it\u2019s a huge life change. But it\u2019s a really wild take to try and act like any sort of physical changes a man goes through are anywhere near what the female body is undergoing.\n\nedit: spelling", "She got some rest at HIS expense. Did you forget that. And no I'm saying given your logic if he's an asshole certainly she is as well. Ide say NAH as long as they both apologized for their lapse in judgement.", "They never said otherwise, the thing though is that OP didn't call his wife a crybaby for being tired, that's what would make her an ah", "Yeah but she got to sleep through the night.", "The second you start name-calling is the moment you gotta ask yourself why you\u2019re being an ahole. If *he\u2019d* called *her* a cry baby because she got to sleep all night and should t complain he\u2019d be getting reamed here! They\u2019re both tired, but that\u2019s not the way to deal with it.", "Waking up multiple times throughout the night isn\u2019t good sleep. In addition, he had to go work an 8 hour shift. I had to do what OP did for almost a week. Hubby was away, so I had to do all night feedings and then go to work. I had to pull over once because I almost nodded off. He is the primary breadwinner, so if God forbid something happened, they would be SOL. In a marriage, sometimes you have to take one for the team.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re married with kids. Barging in and demanding that your partner gets up isn\u2019t a mature or healthy thing to do. She let him do what he needed to do, but she also let him know how she felt about it afterward.", ">she changed the routine\n\nShe changed the night routine and clearly communicated it. He changed the next evenings routine without doing so..I'm not sure why you are having a hard time following this.\n\n\n>I\u2019ve seen it happen plenty of times..\n\nOP never said that was what happened, so I don't know why you are making up stuff to defend him with", "Technically speaking, unless you consider getting sick an action, he changed it by making the offer. We could get technical all we want, but the fact is that she was expecting him to take over when he got home, he knew it and just expected her to deal with his change of plans without a heads up.\n\nFrom reading the post alone, seems like they're good partners who share their responsibility. It just that him and people here underestimate how important it is that communication and emotional work be a shared responsibility.", "You expect her to get a job while breastfeeding a newborn? Jesus christ, get help. Preferably a vasectomy as well.", "Wake times, naps and such greatly vary from person to person. Heck, for newborns even can vary from one week to the next. When my LO was 5 weeks (he's now almost 6 months old), he was very gassy and fussy. Also, he would only do contact naps, which meant I couldn't rest when he was sleeping, for safety. I think the \"sleep when the baby sleeps\" does not apply in a lot of cases. Add to that the fact that my husband only ever gets about 2 hours from when he gets through the door to when he goes to sleep for the night (when he also needs to shower and have dinner, and help with bath time every other day), and those 90 minutes at least in our case would have been all I could have to myself, or to do things that needed to be done around the house. Yes, communication is key, especially when tempers and reactions can be greatly affected by sleep deprivation. If he wanted to sleep he should've said so, and for added consideration towards the wife, they could've ordered takeout or something.", "No problem, it\u2019s not an opinion.", "It's strange to try to make a point like \"it's not exactly the same\" when we are talking about the stresses that may cause bad behavior. Look up ppd and sympathetic hormonal changes in men. It is enough to change behavior which is what we are referencing. Let's not make this into some weird sexist thing where you exclaim men can't go throught what women go thru because that's not relevant.", "It's also not healthy to call him a crybaby.", "That was just her being tired. Same as him taking his nap while she kept the work to allow it."]}
