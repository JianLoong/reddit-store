Especially now more than ever, it is crucial to communicate your needs and talk through and compromise between you two. You are in the stages of life that generally, the goal is for the child to win, and this will come at a loss to general sleep for both of you. You're going to both be crankier than usual.

He has a normal 9-5 job. He doesn't get to skate on responsibilities at home just because he has a job he clocks into. \n\nDo you not think that the father needs to put in his 50% also? Because when he's not there, the mother is putting in 100% and that also includes his commute and break times. \n\nWhat was said was you making an unempethetic AH comment, that the mother needs to step it up.

She's taking care if a newborn. She's keeping someone sustained and alive. Sounds like she's also got more than 50% of childcare when OP is home.

So essentially, just days he doesn't go into work. Someone can take over every blue moon? So realistically, when are you expecting the wife to get normal breaks? Even at work you're entitled to breaks and lunches. SAHP aren't always afforded that luxury and with a 5wo you aren't. \n\nYou suggested division of labor is WILDLY disproportionate.

Whenever she wants really (again within reason) so whats your point? - stop acting like the woman is a slave or something it's beyond pathetic to try spin it that way.
