{"id": 14173, "submission_id": "12e27jk", "title": "AITA for falsely accusing a veteran of stolen valor, when she couldn't give any details about her service?", "selftext": "I (34m) served as a Captain in the Marine Corps. I have left the service, and right now I am doing an MBA. One of my classmates (31F), who we'll call \"J\", is very gentle, very soft-spoken and unassuming. J and I were working together on a case study once, and I started opening up to her about my military service and all the lessons that I've learnt from the Corps. J enthusiastically told me \"that's so cool! I was a Surface Warfare Officer in the Navy!\" \n\nI immediately felt suspicious about this claim. As I said, J is very demure, and she doesn't really have the bravado that is required in the military environment (at least, I feel like a certain amount of bravado is required). I still humored her, and began asking about the details of her military experience - where she deployed, what courses she went through, what ship she served on, etc etc. Suddenly J got all tight-lipped, and she couldn't say anything specific about military life. She kept making excuses along the lines of \"it just wasn't a good period of my life\" and \"I'd rather not talk about it\". Eventually I felt like I had done enough snooping around, and I bluntly told her that she was bullshitting, and that I'd rather not work with a phony.\n\nI talked about this experience with my friend, M, at our school's veterans organization. I told M to be wary of anything J says. M responded by telling me that J did serve, he's seen her paperwork and ID and everything, and that in fact, one of her MBA recommendation letters was written by a retired rear admiral (O-8) who held J in high regard. Whoops.\n\nThe next time I met J, before our class started, I tried to act chummy towards her and make up for accusing her of being a liar. She laughed in my face and told me to \"pound sand, poolee\". And for those of you who don't know, yes, she was being derisive here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680824326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e27jk/aita_for_falsely_accusing_a_veteran_of_stolen/", "score": 9387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have left the service, and right now I am doing an MBA. One of my classmates (31F), who we'll call \"J\", is very gentle, very soft-spoken and unassuming. J and I were working together on a case study once, and I started opening up to her about my military service and all the lessons that I've learnt from the Corps. J enthusiastically told me \"that's so cool! I was a Surface Warfare Officer in the Navy!\" \n\nI immediately felt suspicious about this claim. As I said, J is very demure, and she doesn't really have the bravado that is required in the military environment (at least, I feel like a certain amount of bravado is required). I still humored her, and began asking about the details of her military experience - where she deployed, what courses she went through, what ship she served on, etc etc. Suddenly J got all tight-lipped, and she couldn't say anything specific about military life. She kept making excuses along the lines of \"it just wasn't a good period of my life\" and \"I'd rather not talk about it\". Eventually I felt like I had done enough snooping around, and I bluntly told her that she was bullshitting, and that I'd rather not work with a phony.\n\nI talked about this experience with my friend, M, at our school's veterans organization. I told M to be wary of anything J says. M responded by telling me that J did serve, he's seen her paperwork and ID and everything, and that in fact, one of her MBA recommendation letters was written by a retired rear admiral (O-8) who held J in high regard. Whoops.\n\nThe next time I met J, before our class started, I tried to act chummy towards her and make up for accusing her of being a liar. She laughed in my face and told me to \"pound sand, poolee\". And for those of you who don't know, yes, she was being derisive here.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

YTA twice. \n\nOnce for assuming bravado was needed; Marine Corps is a different breed. She was initially excited to share something she had in common with you. But something changed that.

If he respected her and had any self awareness he'd have \\*actually apologised\\* instead of assuming that he's just so awesome he can just be chummy & his behaviour would be forgiven, cos surely everyone wants his friendship, and he is just \\*shocked\\* that she would tell him to get lost, expert bridge burner that he appears to be.", "Brodozers", "This, right here.  I work in a hospital system, but a lot of our nursing staff who are veterans don\u2019t take our coverage and instead go to our local VA.

He said there was a lot of bad stuff women experienced commonly that just got swept away like it never happened.\n\nAs an aside but also relevant to a certain extent- he passed away about 6 months ago.

Yeah maybe people don\u2019t want to talk about that with new people they meet.
