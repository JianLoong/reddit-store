I am [M21] and she is [F20], so we are usually very chill and tease each other and have a relationship where a little bit of embarrassing each other is involved but if it makes anyone of us uncomfortable, we stop doing that thing. We have been friends for over 5 years. So we usually have a way telling secrets, where we kind of hide it a little and then let it out eventually, or at least I thought that's how it woked because so far she never complained and neither did I and everything seemed fine, so yesterday she sent a screenshot of a tweet, and censored her name but didn't censor the reply which was clearly visible, I let her know that she didn't censor her username and she said \"that's not me\". At this point I thought she was trying to tease, because only she would have a name like that, so I decided to look up her public account, and saw a maximum of 2 tweets 1 I didn't bother to read the 2nd one was a screenshot of a reddit post, she called me and told me that she never shares her teitter account with anyone while giggling but then saying she was pissed at me for looking at her account, so I stopped and closed twitter because I was unsure what she is trying to get across, but if she had told me beforehand to never look her up on twitter, I never would have opened twitter, I don't use it alot because it is too intense for me, so now I wake up in the morning to find that she has left all the groups, she hasn't blocked me but she isn't replying to me, but I think this is a little childish, idk how Twitter works and if private accounts work the same way as they do on Instagram, but possibly ending a long time friendship over someone barely looking at her account is too far, but in the end it is her right to privacy and she also has been through alot, but I have decided to not let her back in the groups unless she asks for it, and I don't really feel the need to apologize because she gave no prior warnings and she has left the group before because of an insignificant arguement (which is something I asked about as well and people had agreed with me) at that point, this friendship started to feel like a chore, and after this, I honestly do not want to continue, because I don't feel lie my opinions are valued or that I am respected enough to even be listened to. \n\n\nAMITA for not apologizing and acting the way I am?
