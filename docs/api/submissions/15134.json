So, my (33M) sister (35F) passed away suddenly in a car accident a month ago. She had two kids (7M and 10F), and their dad (36M) has been mostly absent from their lives since he and my sister split up five years ago. He's not abusive or anything, he just wasn't really interested in being a dad, and would see them maybe once every few months. My sister raised them completely on her own, and I've always been pretty close to them, helping out when I could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince my sister's passing, their dad has stepped up and taken them in, but he doesn't seem to be the most attentive parent. My niece and nephew have been calling me a lot, complaining about how they miss their mom and how their dad is just not the same. They've been begging me to let them come live with me instead. To make matters worse, my parents (late 50s) are completely heartbroken and have started to pressure me into taking the kids in, saying that it's my responsibility as their uncle to provide a loving, stable environment for them since their dad clearly isn't doing a good job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing: I love my niece and nephew, but I'm a single guy with a demanding job and I've never really seen myself as a parent. I'm also currently dealing with my own grief over losing my sister. The thought of taking on the responsibility of raising two kids is incredibly daunting. I feel like I wouldn't be able to give them the attention and support they need, and I worry that I would be doing them a disservice by agreeing to take them in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I've been pushing back against my parents and trying to encourage my niece and nephew to give their dad a chance. I've been talking to their dad too, trying to get him more involved and attentive. My parents are furious with me, saying that I'm being selfish and abandoning my sister's children in their time of need. I'm starting to feel like a total ass for not stepping up, but I just don't know if I can handle it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to take care of my sister's kids after she passed away and leaving them with their estranged dad?", "created_utc": 1681859099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r7zr0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_care_of_my_sisters/", "score": 562, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem to be doing what you can to help everyone - if their dad doesn't have them in grief counseling, it may be something to look into, as well as family counseling to help navigate the uncertain territory everyone finds themselves in.\n\nYour parents are grieving and probably fear \"losing\" their grandchildren. If they are able to see past their own devastated hearts to forging a relationship of some kind with their dad, it may do them good down the line as well as ensuring their dad feels he can count on your family being there for the kids.\n\nAnd in all of this, be kind to yourself.

Helping the dad and being heavily involved.  \n\nYou don't have to take them in because it's not in the cards right now. Their dad is stepping up it sounds like.  \n\nBut if you can- I'd start saving for their college or a rainy day fund for them. In honor of your sister. And just keep being there.

You're staying involved in their lives, while also being in touch with their dad about things.\n\nThe thing is, the kids remember fun times they spent with you, and they might think that living with you would be like that all the time. Or worse, almost the same as living with their mom. The truth is that it won't -- you'll have to quit being the cool uncle and start being a parent. It'll mean disciplining then when they act up, supporting them when they're down, celebrating them when they achieve.  It'll mean being the bad guy every so often. It'll mean giving them what they need, which sometimes isn't the same as what they want. It'll mean telling them no and meaning it. It'll mean giving them limits and consequences. It'll mean showing through your words and actions that you've always got their back even when they make mistakes. It'll mean making the occasional bad memory along with the good ones. But those good memories... They're amazing. \n\nIf the dad really is doing a shit job at raising the kids and you decide you want to take on that responsibility later, you all can revisit the decision then.\n\nMaybe later (once emotions aren't quite so high), you can keep them for an extended holiday.", "Eh, why don't they go to the grandparents? Your parents?", "NTA. Given what you said, who's to say you'd do a better job than their father? Why aren't your parents stepping up to the plate if they think the kids' father is doing such a bad job?

They received some grandparent visitation rights.\n\nThe legal process was scarring. And in hindsight living with my dad, even though I was not interested at the time, turned out to be the best outcome for me.\n\nThey are in no position to make decisions. The accident was to recent. And they are just missing their mom.\n\nNTA. Your parents need a reality check. And you need to make sure that you fight them to not waste their lives trying to chase a memory. \n\nSeriously. This was my life. It doesn\u2019t work well for your parents, or you, or the kids, to keep fighting over it.\n\nBeing \u201cinattentive\u201d is a subjective standard. The bar for neglect is high for where a judge might relocate kids from a living parent to a relative by force. We hadn\u2019t seen my dad in years. He barely had a place to live and had no job.", "NTA\n\nWhy are your parents not an option?  Late 50s is not old and their grandchildren are more their responsibility than they are yours.", "Nta\u2026im so sorry for your loss.

Maybe you could take then for a week or weekend out a month and your parents could do the same to give their dad a bit of help in easing I to being a parent. He's likely lost and confused on what to do even if he's doing his best.

Important to maintain open communication and interactions with the dad. \n\nI had a very dear friend who lost his only daughter. His wife, and a crooked attorney, convinced him to spend every last dime on fight for custody of his grandson. Eventually, they had to accept that it's almost impossible to take custody away from a surviving (wrong word??) parent. Furthermore, attempts ruined the relationship with the grandson's father. He chose to eliminate them from his son's life. It was one of the saddest things I've ever heard or seen. \n\nReframe the discussion. Let an attorney tell your parents there's no basis to fight the children's father for custody. Emphasize potential benefits of cooperation not least of which is not wasting money on pointless legal battle. Talk to the baby daddy (BD, for pack of better term) and ask what you can do to help. I watched my own niece suffer her whole childhood due to custody *issues.* Have some back handed (I referred to them as Auntie) techniques Im happy to share if you send me private message or whatever Reddit calls them.", "NTA\n\nYou'd be an absolutely amazing person to step up and take care of your sister's kids.

And I say this as gently as possible, but it is also *not* your responsibility. Your parents are being massive assholes trying to force the issue, and it seems like people are always more generous with the time, money, and energy of others than they are with their own.\n\nYou seem to be trying to help in other ways that will not break your mental health.

You\u2019re doing the absolute right thing. They deserve a chance to know their father, even if they don\u2019t see it right now. They still have you and loving grandparents by the sound of it.

But offering to help him the way you helped your sister and staying involved in their lives night be something he finds acceptable. My advice would be talk to him, offer what help you can and ask to stay in their lives.", "You are not the asshole.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that I was the oldest of 5 without a single family member that truly wanted the responsibility of dealing with us. I would have given anything for a loving person to prove to me that everyone isn't only worried about what they can get out of you, instead of wondering how they could improve a child's life with no options. I raised my siblings with no life experience. The youngest moved out of my house when I was 30. I missed an entire childhood by being forced to be an adult at the age of 8. I just wished I could have done more for my siblings. Life isn't fair. So why not love and help those with nothing?", "NAH.

However, might I gently suggest that doing some research and reaching out to friends, family, and faith-based, community and government agencies might put your mind at rest as to what resources would be available to you to assist you to take in and raise these kids?  Even a parent who tries hard and fails sometimes is better than a parent who can't be bothered to try at all.\n\nGood luck, whatever you decide.", "NTA You are not responsible for some else\u2019s children.

Good luck.", "I am so sorry for what you are going through.   But I think that what you are missing is that ANYTHING that you do with them will make a difference. As well that you don\u2019t have to do all of it on your own. \n\nFor a bit of perspective - yes, you are going through grief over your sister\u2019s passing.  But you are an adult and you didn\u2019t rely on her for basically your entire world.  But those children did and now their entire world as they knew it is obliterated. And you being there will at least provide them with continuity, stability, and familiarity that they desperately need.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be there for 24x7 support.  Their father can still be involved, as can your parents.  You can bring in a nanny or babysitter as well to be there for any late hours. But they are young and at a vulnerable age, and it seems that all they want is their uncle. This is not to dismiss the question of whether you want to step into a parental role - that is an important consideration. And also one that may be able to be managed in many ways by not being the only one in that role. But if your bigger objection is that you won\u2019t be good at it or will let them down - I think you are underestimating just how much your very presence means to them. You are their comfort and stability right now. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t even have to be long term - maybe for a year, as the brunt of the rawness of her death is hitting them, and as they get used to this new world without her and a world that also includes their father as they get to know him again.

As far as the job goes- you may be able to apply for the Family Leave Act and get a few weeks paid to help you gets the kids settled in your home, and start to heal. Perhaps your parents can help with the kids due to your work schedule, when you aren\u2019t able to be home occasionally.

Is he doing appropriate things like getting them into grief counseling and ensuring they keep up with school and friendships?\n\n Let the dad know that you're there to support him and provide backup, that you're not the enemy and never will be as long as the kids remain safe and healthy. Ask him what he needs. Figure out what part of that you can realistically commit to, and make that your play.
