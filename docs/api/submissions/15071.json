She was too young to fully understand why she\u2019d been taken from her mother or to know to harbor resentment for it. If she\u2019s been seeing her biological mother every weekend/every other weekend for eight years, she should no longer be a stranger unless there was no encouragement or fostering of a relationship there. I can\u2019t help but wonder what is being said to her at home and if she is being discouraged from getting to know her biological mother. \n\nESH except the child. \n\nYour sister sucks for putting herself in the position to begin with. She made her choices, but she also knows she made them and was wrong. She didn\u2019t need you rubbing salt in a wound. \n\nYou suck for not keeping your opinion to yourself. A simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry you are going through this\u201d would have sufficed in the moment. You didn\u2019t have to kick her while she was down. \n\nFinally, the courts suck for severing her parental rights and then still granting visitation and putting both her and her daughter through eight years of torture.", "I\u2019m confused on how your sister is still considered a stranger if she\u2019s been having visitation since the daughter was 4", "NTA. It\u2019s true and may have been not the kindest things to say, but she is also being ridiculous. How was sobering up and becoming a responsible adult now no longer worth all the work cuz she can\u2019t see her daughter. She had plenty of other positives come from that and she can thank her estranged daughter for that.", "I can say this a mom who has a history of addiction.\n\nI quit for my kids.\n\nThere is and was programs she could have joined during pregnancy instead of choosing to be high instead.\n\nShe could have joined a program long before she lost custody and her child was adopted.\n\nI did it...I've now tapered down to 1/2 of my maintenance dose.\n\nMy kids are 6 and 3...neither were born with drugs in their system.\n\nI'm unsure of the amount of time she used after she was taken away but from the sounds of it, too long.\n\nMy mom did foster care...I saw heroin addicted babies and the thought of making my child sick was enough to quit.\n\nNot that I hadn't tried for almost a decade before them, I tried on my own for almost 10 years and my chronic pain always drug me back.\n\nIt hasn't been a perfect journey. \n\nMine wasn't heroin, but I was addicted to pain medicine over a decade ago before they restricted prescriptions and I started buying other peoples prescriptions.\n\nYour not wrong and your sister should probably have let this poor child go instead of confusing her more.\n\nFrom the sounds of it she's a lucky girl who already has a happy family.\n\nOne that didn't lie to her about her own adoption like my family did.\n\nHowever unless you've been through the this kind of thing maybe cut you sister some slack.\n\nShe already knows she's to blame.\n\nI'm going to say NAH\n\nOnly because what you said is true but your mom is right, she doesn't need to have more piled on when she sounds already broken.", "I'm gonna go with YTA, but gently. It is true that no, her daughter doesn't know her. Supervised visits have not been enough to form a bond. Your niece has a loving family. That's important.\n\nBut. Your sister has been sober for *12 years*. That's a hell of an accomplishment. Yeah, she was an addict. She can't change nor help that past. She can't demand her daughter love her-but is it *really* so hard to be kind about it?\n\n12 is a tough age too. For all you both know, her daughter might change her mind more as she grows. She's clearly making great efforts and a little venting in private isn't hurting anyone.\n\nAt the end of the day addiction is a disease. She can't change her past, all she can do is move forward. And she's clearly been doing this.\n\nTL;DR. Her daughter doesn't owe her love or a relationship but acknowledging your sisters pain isn't wrong either. She has a right to be upset, even if this is the consequences of her past. People can change, and she's trying. A little acknowledgment of negative feelings even if one is at fault isn't a bad thing.", "NTA but I would encourage her to move on and keep bettering herself and her life and you never know what the future holds. Maybe she will reach out again but you got to let the child also heal from what happened too and it's unfair to think she's ready for a relationship with her when the daughter is not. You can't force it and maybe she still needs a lot more work", "This is a sad case of the truth hurts. \n\nYou are correct. Sometimes the hard truth is what she\u2019s going to need to hear to really properly grieve the loss of her child. I say loss cause she\u2019s technically estranged at this point. I know she\u2019s not \u2620\ufe0f \n\nI don\u2019t know how and when you delivered the truth. If it was during a moment of needing comfort its harsh. Maybe having said it during an emotionally ready to hear moment it could\u2019ve been received better. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say more info. But leaning to NTA\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sleepy. I\u2019m sorry I missed that. But I still stand by how it was delivered even if time has passed.", "YTA. You sound unsympathetic. Your sister needs support, not an \u201cI told you so\u201d. Let her express pain over her child, who no longer wants to see her. Don\u2019t drag your sister back to her past. There\u2019s no need to bring up her drug use, since she\u2019s been sober for 12 years.", "YTA Yes, it is her fault for what happened. She knows that, realized it 12 years ago when she lost her kid and has been doing everything thing in her power to fix it as much as possible. Unfortunately she hasn't been able to build a relationship with her kid despite her best efforts to improve. You should be supporting your sister, not kicking her down when she's put so much effort into getting up. Now is the time when she most needs support, so she doesn't fall back onto her addictions to cope with failing her goal, the loss of what pushed her to clean herself up.", "NTA, I mean it is the truth but at the same time I am really sad for her. I hope she realizes that all the work she did wasn\u2019t for nothing. I hope she keeps on the right path - none of this can be easy", "YTA she's been sober for TWELVE YEARS and your \"I told you so\" commentary is just cruel. It is entirely her fault and she's of all people, knows that. bBut right now she has to come to terms with losing her daughter for good, and it sounds like her hopes to have a relationship with her kid is what drove her sobriety. \n\nHow about be a good, supportive sibling instead of rubbing her face in the mistakes of her past?", "NAH. I work at an inpatient rehab facility. These stories are heartbreaking to hear because there are people who try really hard to turn their life around. But the fact of the matter is we all have to be accountable for the actions we take. It sucks because what people often do as addicts is just them coping in the only way they know how. It's great to see that your sister has worked so hard for her sobriety and for her recovery but she still needs to own what her addiction caused.\n\nPart of the work in recovery is trying really, really hard and putting the work in everyday, especially in reforming relationships that have been broken or damaged. But it doesn't always pan out that way. Maybe you could have been a bit more sensitive in how you worded it. No matter what the cause is, not being able to have a relationship with your own child is painful AF. But you are right that your sister's addiction cost her that relationship. And she needs to be able to radically accept that or else really put in a crap ton of hard work to really rebuild that relationship, which may mean giving her daughter the space that they need for now. And that's the reality of it.", "I'm gonna go with YTA. It is the truth, no doubt. But she's been sober for 12 years, and in that moment all she needes was your support as a sister. Yes, I bet it's frustrating for you to hear about it a lot, but you can't expect her to treat basically losing her daughter completely after working towards a connection with her as if it's a small nuance. The fact what you're saying is true doesn't mean you had to throw it in her face, seems to me like you could've been more empathetic.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke the truth in response to her complaints.\n\nShe needed to hear it.\n\nHugs", "As a recovering addict, I'm going with NTA...\n\n\nIt was very hard to read your post because I KNEW what was coming. The truth hurts and, in this case, very very badly. Damn... I'm very lucky I turned myself around in time. Had I not gotten my shit together, I too would have been childless. My Son is currently sleeping in his bedroom and it's just me and him. And my two older kids love me again as I have put in the hard work. \n\nI hope your sister continues to maintain her Sobriety and I hope you continue to support her. Maybe one day her Daughter will come around and she'll be able to do right by her again.\n\nShit this made me cry...\n\n\nAgain, NTA.", "NTA. The issue is she is the screw up and now doesn't like the fact that you told her the truth. The truth can hurt, and the quicker she learns that the better.", "NTA \n\n>Our mother found out from her, and said that while I was right, it didn't need to be said then and now.\n\nDid she expect you to lie to her or to stare silently into space instead?", "NTA. Its hard to be sympathetic and always supportive with recovering addicts because you've been there for the whole ride and their mess is messy. (A cousin of mine lost custody due to very similar circumstances. And now that the child is an adult she has a very pleasant relationship getting to know her siblings who were never candidates for adoption like she was. She never wants to be parentified by the people who are her biological parents, though.) She does not see them as her parents because she has lived in a happy home all of her life with the same people.\n\nSo, while I feel sorry for your sister, you did nothing wrong in speaking your peace. Sometimes the truth is hard to bear. That doesn't make it less true.\n\nAnd I love my cousin dearly. But, I can't deny there have been many times when I was out of patience with him and all the crap.", "NTA: Could have worded it better yes I think the fact she clean up her act is great but her daughter has a family who brought her up your sister is just really a stranger she forced to see. \n\nIf she wants a relationship with her daughter then she actually has to work hard for it as she been gone for so long. \n\nAgain great she cleaned up but just because she cleaned up doesn\u2019t mean she immune to repercussions and this is one she hasn\u2019t been in her daughter life she is a stranger. \n\n\nLittle surprised over the adoption because where I live only way for adoption if the parent agree to it even when child is taken off them.", "NTA\n\nTruth hurts..accept it", "Yta your sister fucked up . LOTS of people do with drugs then she got clean that's almost impossible for some people 12 years sober high five her \n\n\nHer daughter has to figure out how to forgive her that takes time  your sister  knows how to be patient \"remind her why she did it \" and bless her for making it back from the Dark side", "YTA. Think what you want, but why couldn't you be empathetic to a grieving mother? While her daughter hasn't passed, she's no longer in your sister's life. That's hard! Show some empathy at least. I feel like you're one of those people whose like \"I just have to be honest\" which are the worst kinds of people. It's literally no skin off your back to say I'm sorry sis, that really sucks and I'm here for you.", "YTA Your niece made the decision to not see your sister anymore and your sister accepted but that must be extremely distressing. It\u2019s traumatic to have a child taken from you, even if it\u2019s for the best of everyone and this probably feels like it\u2019s happening all over again. What she needed was support and what you gave her was basically telling her things she already knows in a very cruel way. \nHave some humanity", "Yta. While truthful, it was hurtful. If what you wrote is what you said, there was no show of empathy. If this sub was \u201cam I correct\u201d then yes absolutely. But it still sucks and obviously the fact that her daughter was taken away was the impetus to get your sister clean. \n\nA non ah approach would\u2019ve been empathetic to her feelings, and encourage her to remain clean because while this is a pain that few know, she still has other goals and dreams she can focus on.", "NTA while it may be hard for your sister to hear that all of that, in the end she is the reason she had to have her child taken away. I think ita one of those things a person needs to face. She had to hear the truth. Be there for your sister. Let her know that even though her daughter doesnt want a relationship right now its doesnt mean that it will always be that way. I think it would be a great idea for your sister to stay in touch with the adoptive parents. She could write letters and send birthday/Christmas presents to still be a part of her life until she is ready. Until then, she should work on herself. Move forward with her life. She is doing well and has come so far. Its important that she doesn't throw it away. We have to remember that addiction really changes a persons brain and way of functioning. And even though she needs family support it doesnt mean that she shouldnt face the consequences of her actions. Just keep up the love and support.

The reason there is no bond now is because 90 minutes once a week do not form a bond - seeing her for a weekend every month would have done more.

The fact that we exist in a world where there are few supports, real engaged supports, for people living with mental health conditions like addiction, the fact that addiction is usually a symptom of more complex traumas, the fact that she was given no recourse despite being sober for 12 years and turning her entire life around for the purpose of one day maybe having a relationship with her child, is awful. Addiction isn\u2019t simply a matter of \u201cdo not take the thing\u201d. It\u2019s a disease. One that requires an incredible amount of work to overcome. Your sister had done that. She needed the impetus but she conquered something that a lot of people struggle to do. Instead of paying her due respect for the work she has done, you punish her for an error over a decade old. That\u2019s not loving or kind of you to do. The fact is one thing that makes the illness so hard to is you get marked with a label for life. The bigger the mistakes you make while fighting it, the longer people shame you for it and continue to remind you. How is that fair? We put all the responsibility on the person suffering to clean up their psychological state, but we hold grudges against them for life and refuse to look at our own issues that make forgiveness harder.

Nothing. \nAnd yeah, it is very unneccassarily cruel not to even let a mother who has given birth taking at least a look at her baby. What harm could she have done to her by just looking at her?

She lost her parental rights years ago, I don't even know how she was awarded visitation in the first place.\n\nIf she'd really been sober and doing everything right since the birth, why didn't reunification happen instead of adoption?  And before anyone replies about CPS taking kids away even when their parents comply, I have ten news stories about children murdered after being returned to bio families too soon for every anecdote you have about your cousin's coworker's sister whose \"kids got taken by the state for no reason even though she totally went to her parenting class.\"\n\n[edited for formatting]", "I agree with this.

And at 12 that's just too much to deal with. I think the mother should revisit her visitation and asked if a weekday that is convenient for her daughter would work instead and perhaps an hour instead of 90 minutes would also be better.
