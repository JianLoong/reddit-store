She was too young to fully understand why she\u2019d been taken from her mother or to know to harbor resentment for it. If she\u2019s been seeing her biological mother every weekend/every other weekend for eight years, she should no longer be a stranger unless there was no encouragement or fostering of a relationship there. I can\u2019t help but wonder what is being said to her at home and if she is being discouraged from getting to know her biological mother. \n\nESH except the child. \n\nYour sister sucks for putting herself in the position to begin with. She made her choices, but she also knows she made them and was wrong. She didn\u2019t need you rubbing salt in a wound. \n\nYou suck for not keeping your opinion to yourself. A simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry you are going through this\u201d would have sufficed in the moment. You didn\u2019t have to kick her while she was down. \n\nFinally, the courts suck for severing her parental rights and then still granting visitation and putting both her and her daughter through eight years of torture.", "I\u2019m confused on how your sister is still considered a stranger if she\u2019s been having visitation since the daughter was 4", "NTA. It\u2019s true and may have been not the kindest things to say, but she is also being ridiculous. How was sobering up and becoming a responsible adult now no longer worth all the work cuz she can\u2019t see her daughter. She had plenty of other positives come from that and she can thank her estranged daughter for that.", "I can say this a mom who has a history of addiction.\n\nI quit for my kids.\n\nThere is and was programs she could have joined during pregnancy instead of choosing to be high instead.\n\nShe could have joined a program long before she lost custody and her child was adopted.\n\nI did it...I've now tapered down to 1/2 of my maintenance dose.\n\nMy kids are 6 and 3...neither were born with drugs in their system.\n\nI'm unsure of the amount of time she used after she was taken away but from the sounds of it, too long.\n\nMy mom did foster care...I saw heroin addicted babies and the thought of making my child sick was enough to quit.\n\nNot that I hadn't tried for almost a decade before them, I tried on my own for almost 10 years and my chronic pain always drug me back.\n\nIt hasn't been a perfect journey. \n\nMine wasn't heroin, but I was addicted to pain medicine over a decade ago before they restricted prescriptions and I started buying other peoples prescriptions.\n\nYour not wrong and your sister should probably have let this poor child go instead of confusing her more.\n\nFrom the sounds of it she's a lucky girl who already has a happy family.\n\nOne that didn't lie to her about her own adoption like my family did.\n\nHowever unless you've been through the this kind of thing maybe cut you sister some slack.\n\nShe already knows she's to blame.\n\nI'm going to say NAH\n\nOnly because what you said is true but your mom is right, she doesn't need to have more piled on when she sounds already broken.", "I'm gonna go with YTA, but gently. It is true that no, her daughter doesn't know her. Supervised visits have not been enough to form a bond. Your niece has a loving family. That's important.\n\nBut. Your sister has been sober for *12 years*. That's a hell of an accomplishment. Yeah, she was an addict. She can't change nor help that past. She can't demand her daughter love her-but is it *really* so hard to be kind about it?\n\n12 is a tough age too. For all you both know, her daughter might change her mind more as she grows. She's clearly making great efforts and a little venting in private isn't hurting anyone.\n\nAt the end of the day addiction is a disease. She can't change her past, all she can do is move forward. And she's clearly been doing this.\n\nTL;DR. Her daughter doesn't owe her love or a relationship but acknowledging your sisters pain isn't wrong either. She has a right to be upset, even if this is the consequences of her past. People can change, and she's trying. A little acknowledgment of negative feelings even if one is at fault isn't a bad thing.", "NTA but I would encourage her to move on and keep bettering herself and her life and you never know what the future holds. Maybe she will reach out again but you got to let the child also heal from what happened too and it's unfair to think she's ready for a relationship with her when the daughter is not. You can't force it and maybe she still needs a lot more work", "This is a sad case of the truth hurts. \n\nYou are correct. Sometimes the hard truth is what she\u2019s going to need to hear to really properly grieve the loss of her child. I say loss cause she\u2019s technically estranged at this point. I know she\u2019s not \u2620\ufe0f \n\nI don\u2019t know how and when you delivered the truth. If it was during a moment of needing comfort its harsh. Maybe having said it during an emotionally ready to hear moment it could\u2019ve been received better. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say more info. But leaning to NTA\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sleepy. I\u2019m sorry I missed that. But I still stand by how it was delivered even if time has passed.", "YTA. You sound unsympathetic. Your sister needs support, not an \u201cI told you so\u201d.

There\u2019s no need to bring up her drug use, since she\u2019s been sober for 12 years.", "YTA Yes, it is her fault for what happened. She knows that, realized it 12 years ago when she lost her kid and has been doing everything thing in her power to fix it as much as possible. Unfortunately she hasn't been able to build a relationship with her kid despite her best efforts to improve. You should be supporting your sister, not kicking her down when she's put so much effort into getting up. Now is the time when she most needs support, so she doesn't fall back onto her addictions to cope with failing her goal, the loss of what pushed her to clean herself up.", "NTA, I mean it is the truth but at the same time I am really sad for her. I hope she realizes that all the work she did wasn\u2019t for nothing. I hope she keeps on the right path - none of this can be easy", "YTA she's been sober for TWELVE YEARS and your \"I told you so\" commentary is just cruel. It is entirely her fault and she's of all people, knows that. bBut right now she has to come to terms with losing her daughter for good, and it sounds like her hopes to have a relationship with her kid is what drove her sobriety. \n\nHow about be a good, supportive sibling instead of rubbing her face in the mistakes of her past?", "NAH. I work at an inpatient rehab facility. These stories are heartbreaking to hear because there are people who try really hard to turn their life around. But the fact of the matter is we all have to be accountable for the actions we take. It sucks because what people often do as addicts is just them coping in the only way they know how. It's great to see that your sister has worked so hard for her sobriety and for her recovery but she still needs to own what her addiction caused.\n\nPart of the work in recovery is trying really, really hard and putting the work in everyday, especially in reforming relationships that have been broken or damaged. But it doesn't always pan out that way. Maybe you could have been a bit more sensitive in how you worded it. No matter what the cause is, not being able to have a relationship with your own child is painful AF. But you are right that your sister's addiction cost her that relationship. And she needs to be able to radically accept that or else really put in a crap ton of hard work to really rebuild that relationship, which may mean giving her daughter the space that they need for now. And that's the reality of it.", "I'm gonna go with YTA. It is the truth, no doubt. But she's been sober for 12 years, and in that moment all she needes was your support as a sister. Yes, I bet it's frustrating for you to hear about it a lot, but you can't expect her to treat basically losing her daughter completely after working towards a connection with her as if it's a small nuance. The fact what you're saying is true doesn't mean you had to throw it in her face, seems to me like you could've been more empathetic.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke the truth in response to her complaints.\n\nShe needed to hear it.\n\nHugs", "As a recovering addict, I'm going with NTA...\n\n\nIt was very hard to read your post because I KNEW what was coming. The truth hurts and, in this case, very very badly. Damn... I'm very lucky I turned myself around in time. Had I not gotten my shit together, I too would have been childless. My Son is currently sleeping in his bedroom and it's just me and him. And my two older kids love me again as I have put in the hard work. \n\nI hope your sister continues to maintain her Sobriety and I hope you continue to support her. Maybe one day her Daughter will come around and she'll be able to do right by her again.\n\nShit this made me cry...\n\n\nAgain, NTA.", "NTA. The issue is she is the screw up and now doesn't like the fact that you told her the truth. The truth can hurt, and the quicker she learns that the better.", "NTA \n\n>Our mother found out from her, and said that while I was right, it didn't need to be said then and now.\n\nDid she expect you to lie to her or to stare silently into space instead?", "NTA. Its hard to be sympathetic and always supportive with recovering addicts because you've been there for the whole ride and their mess is messy. (A cousin of mine lost custody due to very similar circumstances. And now that the child is an adult she has a very pleasant relationship getting to know her siblings who were never candidates for adoption like she was. She never wants to be parentified by the people who are her biological parents, though.) She does not see them as her parents because she has lived in a happy home all of her life with the same people.\n\nSo, while I feel sorry for your sister, you did nothing wrong in speaking your peace. Sometimes the truth is hard to bear. That doesn't make it less true.\n\nAnd I love my cousin dearly. But, I can't deny there have been many times when I was out of patience with him and all the crap.", "NTA: Could have worded it better yes I think the fact she clean up her act is great but her daughter has a family who brought her up your sister is just really a stranger she forced to see. \n\nIf she wants a relationship with her daughter then she actually has to work hard for it as she been gone for so long. \n\nAgain great she cleaned up but just because she cleaned up doesn\u2019t mean she immune to repercussions and this is one she hasn\u2019t been in her daughter life she is a stranger. \n\n\nLittle surprised over the adoption because where I live only way for adoption if the parent agree to it even when child is taken off them.", "NTA\n\nTruth hurts..accept it", "Yta your sister fucked up . LOTS of people do with drugs then she got clean that's almost impossible for some people 12 years sober high five her \n\n\nHer daughter has to figure out how to forgive her that takes time  your sister  knows how to be patient \"remind her why she did it \" and bless her for making it back from the Dark side", "YTA. Think what you want, but why couldn't you be empathetic to a grieving mother? While her daughter hasn't passed, she's no longer in your sister's life. That's hard! Show some empathy at least. I feel like you're one of those people whose like \"I just have to be honest\" which are the worst kinds of people. It's literally no skin off your back to say I'm sorry sis, that really sucks and I'm here for you.", "YTA Your niece made the decision to not see your sister anymore and your sister accepted but that must be extremely distressing. It\u2019s traumatic to have a child taken from you, even if it\u2019s for the best of everyone and this probably feels like it\u2019s happening all over again. What she needed was support and what you gave her was basically telling her things she already knows in a very cruel way. \nHave some humanity", "Yta. While truthful, it was hurtful. If what you wrote is what you said, there was no show of empathy. If this sub was \u201cam I correct\u201d then yes absolutely. But it still sucks and obviously the fact that her daughter was taken away was the impetus to get your sister clean. \n\nA non ah approach would\u2019ve been empathetic to her feelings, and encourage her to remain clean because while this is a pain that few know, she still has other goals and dreams she can focus on.", "NTA while it may be hard for your sister to hear that all of that, in the end she is the reason she had to have her child taken away. I think ita one of those things a person needs to face. She had to hear the truth. Be there for your sister. Let her know that even though her daughter doesnt want a relationship right now its doesnt mean that it will always be that way. I think it would be a great idea for your sister to stay in touch with the adoptive parents. She could write letters and send birthday/Christmas presents to still be a part of her life until she is ready. Until then, she should work on herself. Move forward with her life. She is doing well and has come so far. Its important that she doesn't throw it away. We have to remember that addiction really changes a persons brain and way of functioning. And even though she needs family support it doesnt mean that she shouldnt face the consequences of her actions. Just keep up the love and support.

I'm positive your sister more than understands the gravity of her mistakes. You rubbing salt into her wounds was a cruel thing to do. I know you were probably hurt by her addiction as well, but if you are going to remain in her life, you need to be supportive. Not another reminder of all of her pain.", "YTA.

She started seeing her daughter at 4 and the daughter considers her a stranger? I'm almost sure the parents have deeply influenced her vision (probably fearing to lose their daughter).\n\n Plus to me, this almost feels like kidnapping a child. They never really gave the mother time to recover herself and at 4 the daughter was already in a stable adoption? Or she was adopted later, after the mother began visitations (and in that case: why she was up for adoption when her mother was sober?)? If the mother was clean by the time her daughter was 4, I suppose her journey began a decent amount of time before, this post seems to imply she even started becoming cleam right after the birth... So why her daughter was put up for adoption? I don't know the English terms but here, there is a difference between adoption and \"in affido\" which would have been better here.\n\nThis story honestly seems sad. It seems they just took the child without giving the mother a chance despite her being clean in a reasonable time... The daughter is 12 year old. OP's sister has been sober for 12 years (based on the post). This isn't the right and human way, in my opinion. I have seen similar cases (we have little informations here, but still) handled in a way different way, respectful to the safety and well being of the child without immediately putting them up for adoption when the mother was steadily recovering (psychiatrists and so on can also testify how the clean journey is going, which is crucial).", "But his sister doesn\u2019t suck *now*, and the situation OP is asking about is if he\u2019s being an AH for not giving her some sympathy while she\u2019s essentially grieving a lost relationship.

Harder when you grow up with a sister that is an addict\u2014 that\u2019s got to have left OP with some damage. Why is all your empathy directed at the mother in this story, and none of it to OP?

She may have realized her faults after her daughter got taken away and now she is sober since then, which is amazing and the sister can be really proud of that. However saying she was a fit mother and that the child was kidnapped is just a lie. No parent will be fit to care for a child while being a heroin addict and CPS couldnt know she would stay Sober since addicts usually fall back a few times to drugs, so it was best to give her into a fit family. I agree With the First part but saying she was a fit mother and she got kidnapped is just wrong", "There's more going on in this story. The mother could not have had her parental rights terminated for adoption based on a single positive at birth, no matter the state.

You have to be an unfit parent, displayed in different ways over time, despite court ordered therapy and resources **OR** you voluntarily sign them over. \n\nDrugs are only a symptom of the problem.

Legally speaking once the child is adopted there's no such thing as court ordered visitation. The adoptive parents can coordinate visitation out of the goodness of their hearts, but the courts already decided who the parents are.", "The child was taken at birth, and it took four years for her to get recognized as sober and get visitation.

Research shows that adoptive children have the best outcomes when they have contact with their bio family. In a small number of cases safeguarding concerns outweigh this, but OP's sister has been clean for 12 years and as far as we know has not been accused of any dangerous behaviour. \n\nThe adoptive parents should be working with OP's sister to try and support niece to get to the root of any issues and see what can potentially be done to maintain some sort of a relationship.

Lots of details are missing so it's impossible to know.\n\nIt's similar to a situation with parents who separate. Sometimes you have to do things that you don't want to because it's in the best interests of the child. At the age niece was, she would have taken their lead. Where was the visitation. Was it a contact centre? Or a park? Why was it \"talking to a stranger for 90 minutes\" for 8 years. Did they invite OP's sister to do contact in a location niece was comfortable in? Would they allow visitation to go on longer than 90 minutes if it was going well so they could build a relationship?\n\nEnsuring visitation happened can just be a tick box exercise and a pat on the back.

Her mom is the entire reason why her whole life was uprooted the second she came into this world, and despite being placed and happy with a new family the daughter still gets to experience any and all feelings attached to this. \n\n I never truly understood the ways which my addiction harmed my loved ones until my father became an addict and I felt the loss and the pain first hand. Actions have consequences, and that doesn't mean that OP's sister would suddenly forgo the feelings of guilt and pain attached to the scenario.

She wanted me to love her as my mother, my family wanted me to acknowledge my roots, even the \"impartial 3rd party (social worker in this case)\" made it seem like it was *so nice* my mother wanted to be involved and that I should be *so pleased.* Its rough. No one had to say anything negative about it for me to get there and honestly I find that assumption weird.

As OP said in their post, the child in question was taken away from her birth mother, literally on the day she was born. Reunification would have only benefited the mother and actually harmed the child. Science has established that the bond a child forms in infancy with their first main caregiver is a bond that can't actually be replaced. Separating the child from this main caregiver literally causes children mental and physical distress. Usually, when it comes to family law matters, the court's main duty is to ensure the welfare of the child. Removing the child from the care of the foster parents who have been caring for her since birth would have been traumatic, so that's most likely why it didn't happen. \n\nThere's actually been a few wild cases in the UK involving infant separation. The one I remember the most is where a birth mother sold her child to a lesbian couple, I think the birth mother was a drug addict. I can't remember if it was social services or the child's birth family, but someone took the lesbian couple to court to try and take the child away. The court refused to separate the child from the lesbian couple even though it wasn't actually legal for same-sex couples to adopt at the time. At the time of the court proceedings, the child had already been living with the lesbian couple for a few years. The court decided that it wouldn't be in the child's best interest to remove them from the lesbian couple because the child was attached to them and was developing well/normally under their care.", "Absolutely she's allowed to grieve. But saying that I became sober for 12 years for her and the 12 yrs is worthy enough to get her back is the nonsensical part. The child were taken away from birth. She has been raised from day 1 by the adopted/foster parents. No amount of here blood relation with this women will or should be worthy enough over the people that raised her. Especially if the child doesn't want to converse with this literal \"stranger\". Dont even get involved in that kids life. She don't have a child.

I am reminded of the book \"The Kid\" by Dan Savage about how he and his husband adopted their son through an open adoption (whose mother also abused drugs). They really liked her, even giving their son her last name, which proved to be a legal nightmare for a gay couple, and she would just have visits and regular communication with her son, although she had no legal right to those. They were \"supervised\" in the sense that Dan or his husband would probably there, but they weren't supervised through a social worker or anything. From what I've read, their son is now an adult and continues to have a relationship with his mom. \n\nSo I am confused, because it seems like visitation is not the choice of the adoptive parents here, because they sure don't seem particularly supportive of it, but it also seems like there is some legal requirement for it to happen (and that they're using the kid to manipulate OP's sister into giving up that right). But why would there be a legally right to visitation for someone whose rights were terminated? It makes no sense. The only thing I can think of is that this entire process was done in some legally dubious way and visitation was offered as some form restitution, because they didn't want OP's sister to actually know she probably had more grounds to reassert custody (even at 4 years ago, there is some legal precedent that she would have gotten at least some custody back).", "Yeah there's a difference between stranger and once a week visits", "She\u2019s his sister? Now I\u2019m all confused haha", "Supervised visits - for 8 years this child has spent 90 minutes with a woman she doesn't know being observed by a social worker.... that doesn't lend to developing a real relationship with someone. The only time I've seen supervised visits be beneficial is when the child actually recognizes the parent AS THEIR PARENT not a random person telling you they are your parent", "In some states parental rights are terminated if they the baby is born with a positive tox screen or at birth the parent has had long-term drug use", "Honestly I feel like there is more to the story here on this. CPS can't just adopt out kids without parental consent or by ruling of a judge. Either the sister signed away her parental rights or she fucked up so badly that a judge said no way in hell is this woman ever getting her kid back. If she has truly been sober since she lost her daughter then she should've been able to prove to a judge that she was a fit parent. Maybe she wasn't as sober as she claimed to be. It is strange that it took her 4 years to get visitation rights with her daughter. Was she perhaps in jail during that time? Or was she not following court orders (like staying clean from drugs)? Was she not able to prove herself mentally stable enough to be around her daughter until then? Sorry but if CPS takes your child away and adopts them out then the parent is almost always the one who fucked up big time. CPS cares first and foremost about reuniting families (sometimes a little too much in my opinion), the fact that this didn't happen in this case means there has to be more to the story.", "There have been cases in the US where children were taken from the only homes they'd known to be united with their birth parents. Since the children had strong loving relationships (and secure attachments during infancy) with the people who fostered/adopted them, it was awful. \n\nThe OP's sister doesn't seem to be asking for custody here. She's mourning the loss of a relationship that she never had and the loss of a relationship that she tried to have. I worked with an adult college student who lost custody of her daughter for several years because of her drug (the student's) drug abuse. Her mother took in the kid. She was in the midst of trying to repair her relationship with her daughter, who didn't think of her as a \"real mom.\" It sucked for everyone.", "In the US, we've had courts rule opposite this precedent though, usually in regards to children of indigenous parents. If a parent's legal right was terminated unfairly or illegally, it doesn't matter what the child wants. If her daughter was removed from her care in the hospital due to potential harm, that doesn't immediately terminate her parental rights. And considering how long that process is, I'm kind of shocked they were able to do that to a person who seems to have *immediately* gotten sober. It's also fishy to me that she has legal visitation right after presumably having her parental rights terminated and the kid being legally adopted. It almost sounds like that was a bone thrown to her to distract her from the fact that what they did might have been illegal.", "Oh god it's like the Patricia Stallings case, truly horrible. She spent years in prison fighting a wrongful conviction due to a misdiagnosis of her son's genetic condition. What's crazy is that it can all be linked back to getting lost on her way to a specialty hospital, and going to a regular ER instead. The specialized hospital was likely to recognize the symptoms right away, the ER doctors figured she had poisoned him with anti-freeze.

Not saying what she did was right obviously, but she did the right thing and got help.", "I don\u2019t know how this works in all states, but I have friends who adopted their foster daughters so I have some familiarity with how it worked in Iowa about 18 years ago. \n\nAs we have come to learn more about attachment disorders things are often a little different when it is a baby the parent looses custody of. One of the girls my friends adopted was taken from the bio mom at birth. Bio mom had a year to get her life together and prove to be a fit parent to regain custody. After that parental rights are terminated and the one yr old can be adopted. In this case the thinking is what is best for the child that they can grow up in a stable environment and form attachments. So if OP\u2019s sister was clean but not necessarily stable enough to regain custody that maybe why the daughter was allowed to be adopted. The visitation may have been a private arrangement with the adoptive parents. \n\nIt is definitely different when it is a toddler or kid who have already bonded with their bio parent(s).", "Omg I feel so sorry for these children. Adoption already comes with trauma, I can't imagine what going through double the trauma must have felt like. I hope these children eventually found happiness and got the therapy they needed. I really hope this isn't something that happens often.\n\nI feel like, as a society, we really need to change the way we view children. Children are still being thought of as propery that people feel entitled to. Biological parents feel like they are entitled to be parents to their children even if they are abusive or not capable of raising them. Infertile people feel like they're owed a child, so they go chasing after adoptable infants and ignore older adoptable children. No one really ever stops to think about what is best for the child. It's always about what the adults want. \n\nI'm glad that the UK family court system is at least doing it right. Here, the family courts don't give two shits about what the parents want because the Children Act 1989 literally says it's just the child that matters. Parents have to justify how what they want is in the interests of their child in cases where separated biological parents are fighting over the child. We also have a long history of the court system taking over the parental role for children when parents were doing stupid shit like refusing medical treatment for their children because of personal feelings they had. Like here, the medical care of Jehovah Witness children is controlled by the courts and not their parents.", "She did when she made the choice to prioritise drugs over her child. \n\nShe could have had an abortion like a decent human being.", "Well said, there's another very real factor that a lot of people in this thread are discounting with the girl's feelings too, and that's the addiction during pregnancy. If she was put into the system the second she was born, it's very likely there were complications due to the addiction, so she as a baby was very likely addicted to heroin.\n\nEven if she got through all of the medical issues that causes while an infant, if her adopted parents were honest about the whole adoption process the way my parents were, that would create a lot of anger once she understood what it meant. Especially in a young kid, even once she sees bio-mom is clean now. \"Why couldn't she have kept clean for me? Did she not love me enough?\" The second question is a common one among most adoptees, and having what she thinks is a concrete answer to it would be heartbreaking for her.", "That's really not a good way to look at this.

And that was after consistently abusing every child left in her custody. That was 6 kids, including me. They knew that if they let her keep another child, she would abuse it. So the sister might have either had a track record a mile long or the baby was born so addicted to drugs, she almost died. \n\n\nToo many people forget about the damage addiction does to children. They had to live and grow up in horrible environments. They had to bear witness and experience the destruction first hand. Getting sober won't unto the trauma. Getting sober won't give them back the their childhood. Getting sober doesn't automatically give you forgiveness and love. Because all that child knows is that for YEARS that drug was more important then them. And that hurt never goes away. Now matter how sober you get.", "Okay, and? If she couldn't get sober for the child inside her literally feeding off her, she doesn't deserve to be in the life of that child after they are no longer dependent on her for food and oxygen. I would have a lot more sympathy if she didn't pop a positive tox screen at birth, but instead she may have actually ruined the life of another person- between the attachment disorders, lifelong addiction issues or temptations for the child, likely mood disturbances, lowered IQ, and developmental delays that are frequent in people who were exposed to opiates in the womb and her complete lack of accountability in this moment for her actions while pregnant, this person shouldn't be near the child at all.", "In general the standards to get your child back are higher than those to become a foster parent, so I would venture to guess the \"nightmare\" mostly comes from inadequate foster parents, not from parents trying to reestablish their custody rights.", "What if your bio parent/s had been able to course correct while you were still quite young, and you\u2019d gotten the chance to grow up with your (imperfect, sure, but loving and competent) bio parents with that same bonding with them, and never having needed adoptive parents? \n\nI know that that\u2019s probably an idealized oversimplification, and I\u2019m asking out of genuine curiosity, so please feel free to not answer if it\u2019s triggering or not something you feel like explaining!!", "What I hate is people acting like the title \"mother\" has magic powers and that everyone who gives birth has some sacred right to raise that child, regardless of the harm they might do to it. \n\nChildren should go to a home that will actually care for them.

OP is NTA because the sister did drugs 12 years ago? \n\nYou can believe whatever you want, the fact is, the foster system is created to be an adoption fast lane. It's created to keep kids in a safe home until they can be reunited with family whenever possible. Let me ask you this -- if a single parent has a medical incident and goes into an extended coma for a year, and they have no other family, should their parental rights be permanently terminated? If they recover a year later to where they can take care of a child, it should just be \"oops too late, shouldn't have been in that coma.\" Or is it that for this medical issue, we can effectively blame a 19 year old and insist she can never be a good and loving parent? \n\nPeople get sober for their children, their parents, their partner, their dog, all the time.

The answer has never for a second changed from an emphatic \"hell no.\"  Because I have a family, just as I presume you have a family.  If someone came in one day and pointed out a person on the street and told you that was your \"real family\", how would you expect to feel?  For me, I've got my established family- the ones who actually raised me and actually put the time, love and devotion in.  They aren't perfect either.  There is no reason on earth for me to want to have a new set of parents (who were actually the old set).  \n\nAs life would have it, I do know who my biological parents are, but not because anyone was trying to make me have a relationship with them.  It sort of just bubbled to the surface of family skeletons in closets the way things sometimes do.  Knowing didn't change anything for me except the feeling that I want nothing to do with those people intensified.  They each have grown and matured and each have their own separate families with kids of their own.  Those kids are not and have never been my siblings, I have no relationship with them and I want no relationship with them.  Because I already have my own family and the idea of tacking on a new \"set\" of family members is absurd to me.  \n\nThe other big thing for me is the assumption that bio parents who got their acts together would be loving and competent going forward.  Maybe, maybe not but they have already concretely demonstrated the ability to be incompetent and unloving.  The adoptive parents had to jump through all kinds of hoops to prove they were very likely to be stable, nurturing and health parents to the child.  On paper its a no-brainer to me that we shouldn't send children to live with once-proven unfit parents on the flimsiest of bases that is biology.  I've said for as long as I can remember that I'm thankful they gave me up/surrendered/lost me because it was the single best thing they ever could have done for me.  \n\nParenting is a thankless job.  Parenting is about ensuring your child has what they need to grow and thrive, its not supposed to be about what the parent needs.  Giving up a child you can't take care of so someone else can give them a good life is (in my mind) the quintessential act of selfless love. For that act to have the intended effect, you have to follow through with it by leaving the child alone to live their life.
