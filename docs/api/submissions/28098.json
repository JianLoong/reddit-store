It\u2019s a bit of back story, so Buckle in. \n\nA year ago, when we announced our pregnancy, everyone was super happy that we are having the first grand baby. That is, until my brother and his wife heard the news. They were irate, claiming \u201cwe got married first, it should be us having babies before you!!\u201d Him and his wife have been married 4 years, while my wife and I got married a few months prior to finding out we were expecting. \n\nThey dealt with years of infertility, so they were just ultra dramatic the whole pregnancy, playing a woe is me, and we rightfully removed ourselves from them until about a month after our son was born; when we got a phone call that they\u2019re finally pregnant. \n\nThe kicker, is that they now have found out what they\u2019re having, and naming their child the same name as ours. \n\nMy brother and I have different moms, but our dads name is Allen. Pretty normal white dude name. My wife and I named our son Johnathan Allen, after my dad, and my brother and his wife are naming their son \u201cJason Allen\u201d. So both boys have the same initials, as our last names are the same. \n\nMy wife and I are a bit upset, but understanding. My dad is awesome - volunteer firefighter, who spends his free time regurgitating baseball facts. \n\nMy dad is a little weirded out by it, and suggested they use \u201ccraig\u201d as a middle name, as that\u2019s his middle name. They won\u2019t budge. \n\nAm I the asshole if we take a step back from them, and let them figure out on their own how weird this all is??\n\nETA: we plan on renaming our son Johnathan Reece, after my father in law, if they don\u2019t change their baby name after he is born.", "created_utc": 1696281287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16y8nen/aita_family_drama_in_pursuit_changing_my_sons_name/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jonathan and Jason are not the same name. Why does it matter that the middle name is the same?", "YTA, it's a family  name, it is SHARED by DEFINITION.\n\nYou can't claim initials, either. You are bringing the drama where no drama needs to go.", "YTA. They don't have the same name and I don't understand why same initials are an issue. You are making a big deal out of nothing.", "YTA.  Leave your son's name alone.  My grampa was Benjamin.  My dad is X Benjamin.  My brother is X Benjamin II.  My cousin is Benjamin W.  Notice the thread of \"Benjamin?\"  It's no big deal.", "Yes YTA. Both you and your sibling want to honor your father  when you named  your children. Grow up, you do not get to call dibs on names and it's and foolish thing to get bent out of shape about", "Why change the name? You had it first. It's a middle name, not like people will be calling him that most likely. So they use it as a middle name too. I think your dad sounds awesome enough to handle two kids sharing his name.", "YTA this is ridiculous. \n\nThe first names are different. Very normal for cousins to share a middle name if the tradition is to use the name of an important family member.", "YWBTA, it's not weird tbh, it's a family name. You are overreacting to the least used name a person has.", "ESH\n\nWho cares if the boys have the same middle name? Who cares if they have the same initials too?", "YTA because who cares if they have the same middle name? If you want to change something spell Jonathan without the \"h.\" Johnathan is going to make him have to tell people how to spell it for the rest of his life.", "YTA.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Middle names are hardly used and initials are used even less, and you\u2019ll find plenty and plenty of people in your life that have the same initials. \n\nDo you have any idea how many people have the middle name Mary?", "Coming from a Family with at least a dozen Peters, I assure you that identical initials =/= identical names, and 99.99% of the people who know both boys won\u2019t give a flip, or even remember what their middle names are. \n\nESH, because both you and your brother are AHs.", "YTA", "YTA - Same middle name? Who the hell cares? I think you're as bad as you claim your brother is.", "> Family drama in Pursuit\n\nYou're the one pursuing drama, not the other way around.\n\nMiddle names? Initials? Seriously, that's the situation that's you're all worked up over?\n\nYour kid's Johnathan. Their kid is Jason. Nobody gives a shit about last names. Nobody gives a shit about initials. Move on.\n\nYTA.", "No one ever uses middle names.  Half the girls in my extended family have the middle name \"Rose\" and it has never caused any issues.  You are making a mountain out of a mole hill.", "Yes you should take a step back from them. Tell them you have outgrown the competition that your brother is still holding onto. Explain that your life doesn\u2019t evolve around his and he need to stop thinking it does.\n\nInstead of changing the middle name and maybe hurting your dad or giving your brother the satisfaction. Change the first name to Reece. I this flows great", "NTA\n\nThey are being difficult on purpose. Don't change your Son's name because of them.", "NAH. As long as you didn\u2019t express you were upset to your brother, I don\u2019t think you are TA. In some cultures, it\u2019s actually common for relatives to have the same middle name. It could actually be a nice bond between the cousins.", "My grandfather was Francis John, my father is Francis John, I have 2 uncles named John Francis, I have a cousin Francis John, and an Aunt Fransis. \n\nNTA, you can name your kid whatever you want, but I feel like this is a mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA.  People like your brother and his wife are awful.  The entitlement and inability to be happy for you for having your son because they haven't yet is gross.   Just gross.  The name thing is beyond cringe.  Are they treating it like a competition?  What is the deal?  My second son is Mitchell Alexander and after his mother and I got divorced she named her son with her second husband Alexander for his first name.  I've never understood it.  It's stupid.  Honestly, changing your son's name so as to avoid issues sounds like a win.  Your father is already weirded out by it and he knows both why you gave him that middle name and why you would be changing it.  I think he might actually be happy to avoid the drama.  I would definitely take a step back from the brother.  Honestly, they sound disturbed.", "NTA, he's your child, you get to pick his name and make changes to it as you see fit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're not the same names.

My brother thought it was such a great idea that he did the same for his next daughter. Then my sister allowed me to name her third child, a daughter, which I continued the tradition with a slight twist by making it her first name. All of these cousins brag that they are named after Grandma! \n\nThink of the reason you used \u2018Allen\u2019. Does it make you smile? I would think it is the same warm wonderful proud feeling for your brother too.

What does it matter?", "Outlier NTA.\n\nI understand why you're changing your baby's name.\n\nYou're discomforted by what you believed to be the process that she chose the name. That's why you mentioned her complaining about how she \"should have been first!!\" It's not necessarily *about* the name but the precedent it sets. That your children are always going to be compared. Her behavior and actions have dark tones to what it could turn into later on in life. Take a step back, don't discuss why, protect your baby.\n\nIf you change your babies name you don't have to tell her or anyone, all you have to do is correct them and say his new name, no explanation needed.\n\nTo the people saying it's just a name, so is OPs baby.
