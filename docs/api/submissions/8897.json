It's gotten to a point where Kim refuses to go to school almost every single day.  In January, she went to school 4 days.  Total.  We've been working with the school to allow Kim to get homework digitally, but she doesn't keep up with it.   My wife and I have gotten her into therapy as well as counseling through her school last fall, but results of that have been mixed as I don't think Kim is putting in the necessary work on her end.  She is on medication, but we're still working with her doctor to find the right combination to meet her needs.\n\nIf Kim had her way, she'd just spend all day in bed with her laptop.  She doesn't do anything to help around the house, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, doesn't eat meals with the family, just sits in her room on her computer all day and all night.  We've tried so many different things and nothing has seemed to make any positive change.  It's infuriating and heartbreaking at the same time.  \n\nOne constant throughout all of this has been her computer and phone.  She's on them constantly.  No matter how many times we bring this up to her that maybe she needs to spend less time in front of a screen, she insists that isn't the cause of her problems.  \n\nSo, finally I decided to start changing our WiFi password to one that only my wife and I know.  I change it every night before we go to sleep and don't change it back to the one the kids know until after we get home from work.  Kim was not happy about this and used up all of our family plan data in less than a week.  We had to change our plan to restrict her usage.  At first, my wife was on board with this as she also felt that Kim was spending too much time on her phone and computer.  But after Kim basically through a gigantic tantrum about it, my wife is not so sure.\n\nKim tried to use the argument that if we want her to do school work at home, she needs the internet.  But she wasn't doing the work anyway so that argument didn't really hold water for me.  She tried saying that she needs the internet to have access to her support network, but we take her to therapy and counseling in person and I feel if she put more effort into those, then maybe she would make some progress.  \n\nKim hates me for this and told me that restricting her internet access in this day and age is abuse.  My wife is also wavering on this idea because Kim isn't showing any positive changes and still isn't going to school.  \n\nEvery single day is an emotional roller coaster for me.  Anger, frustration, embarrassment, futility, failure, fear.  I know Kim is struggling and seeing your child go through something that you can't fix is a hell I wouldn't wish on anybody.  \n\nAll I'm trying to do is gently force Kim to focus on her issues and take steps necessary to address them and make progress towards being a functional adult.  She has 3 acceptance letters to colleges that she is very unlikely to attend now.", "created_utc": 1675287923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r770e/aita_for_changing_the_wifi_password_every_day/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is using her addiction to her devices to hide from her feelings. \n\nBut, in my opinion, you are right to take steps to help your children manage their addictions while they are minors. We are struggling with similar issues in our household. Phones are addictive. They are designed to be addictive. But they're also socially acceptable, and necessary, so it's complicated. If I ever figure it out, I'll let you know.", "INFO: What kind of diagnosis does she have? What medications have you tried? Have you asked her if she feels she has a good connection with her therapist? There are so many factors here. \n\nI have ADHD and didn't get diagnosed until my late 20s. I could spend all day staring at a screen *knowing* I had school work but unable to force my brain to focus on it. Not because I'm lazy, not because I didn't want to, but simply because of a neurodevelopmental that results in my brain not processing certain neurochemicals correctly. Getting a diagnosis, medication, and a good therapist have helped, but sometimes it's still a struggle. \n\nYour daughter's screen time might be a symptom, not the cause of the problem. \n\nHave you asked if she wants to switch schools? Maybe something traumatic happened that she isn't comfortable sharing? \n\nShe's 17, can she enroll in a GED program? \n\nHelp her figure out how to defer her college admission offers for a year so she has a chance to sort out her mental health.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA because this is an impossible situation and I really feel for all of you.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible that your daughter\u2019s support network is online. It\u2019s also very possible that this is toxic and could be detrimental to her mental health. Without actually speaking with her, it\u2019s impossible to know.\n\nSo that she\u2019s not held back with support and school work, could you allow her wifi access with parental controls on it? If it was me, I\u2019d be looking to block access to any potentially harmful material (not saying that she does, but as an example, if she had an ED, I\u2019d block access to pro-Ana websites). It might be worth exploring this with her and her therapist to find a way that she can use it for support but in a healthy way and ensure that she\u2019s not being bullied online or anything.\n\nMore than anything though, you need to *show* her your unconditional love for her. Tell her you love her and often. Talk to her, and more than that, LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS (both verbally and non verbally). She sounds as if she might have pretty severe depression so you need to show her that you\u2019re being supportive and not punishing her by removing her access to the internet, but protect her from harm. \n\nSeek professional support for yourself too, you\u2019ll need someone to support yourself as you navigate through this together.", "What does her therapist say?", "What Kim is doing is obviously unhealthy. You need to ask the professionals if limiting her Internet use is the best way to help her. I suspect they'll say yes.", "INFO:  What does Kim's therapist say about her internet usage and your solution?", "NTA but I'm joining with some of the voices here saying Kim May need more intensive intervention than just therapy and limited internet. An inpatient treatment program may be necessary to get more to the root of her issues and break the internet addiction/reliance.", "You need to set aside your feelings of anger, embarrassment, etc. Your daughter's mental health issues mean that her brain does not reach the same conclusions your brain does. What seems obvious or sensible to you does not seem the same way to her.\n\nThat said, you've got a point that giving her Internet access so that she can do her homework is pointless if she doesn't actually do her homework. And, if she were to attend school, I assume they would not let her spend all day glued to her phone and laptop.\n\nINFO: What is she actually doing on her screens? Watching videos? Playing games? Interacting with other people?", "NTA. \n\nIf you enable her, she may never shake it. She's young and neurally plastic enough that this is the time for her to heal and get a handle on her issues. Letting her be a lump, and facilitating it, can rob her of her functional adulthood for life.\n\nShe needs to learn that there won't always be mummy and daddy around to scrape her off the floor.", "NTA \n\nHave you looked at a private inhouse facility? \n\nWhen I went through hell and back I found a place to go for a 4 week inpatient stay. They had Psychiatric assistance, great food, was a low needs facility. You attended a class daily. You got your meds worked on and changed to suit you. \n\nSometimes the professionals can help. And low needs means lots of other struggling people in a similar situation \n\nTalk to some professionals around you and see what has a good reputation", "I honestly don\u2019t feel right to judge this situation, because it\u2019s complex as hell. I\u2019d honestly try to get a hold of her therapist and tell them that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing the right thing or only making things worse for Kim. \nMaybe you don\u2019t and we judge you as N T A and Kim only slips further away. \nTry talking to her therapist and don\u2019t feel embarrassed. I wish you, your family and Kim only the best.", "NAH. Hey there. This is like looking in a mirror at my younger self. Firstly, let me say I recognize how absolutely hard this is for you, your daughter, your family, and I am beyond relieved that you are actively seeking help.\n\nWhen your daughter says her support network is online, I believe that. Whatever her hobbies/interests, the internet infinitely multiplies the number of people you can meet who share those interests. She may have stronger relationships with people online than she does in person. In fact, she may ONLY have online relationships that fulfill her and that motivate her as peers do.\n\nThe thing about school is that it only works if you maintain the balance of peer to peer social dynamics. You feel the pressure to relate and match your peers, better your rivals, improve your self to outdo those who you don\u2019t like.\n\nBut if her peers, her REAL friends, are all online then she has stepped out of the social dynamic that makes school both consciously and subconsciously purposeful.\n\nAs such, school is pointless. Why do the work when none of the people you truly care about benefit from it. As a teenager, her hierarchy of needs is solely fixated on her feeling of \u201cbelonging\u201d. Additionally, if she\u2019s being bullied or feels like and outcast, it reinforces her decision to remain truant. Kids with mental health issues still found ways to exit this social dynamic in the past when the internet didn\u2019t exist - they were gangsters, greasers, stoners, basement dwellers, punks, etc. Same problem, different era.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to chat more, I was once in the same exact place as your daughter.\n\nMy advice to you would be to try and get involved with her online circle. Get them support her or encourage her to do what\u2019s good for her. They are real relationships and if you \u201cturn them off\u201d by restricting her access, it would be the same as preventing her from seeing friends/loved ones. But if it\u2019s an echo chamber, it may be the exact thing making her feel like her decisions are valid. For a person in a dark place, pulling away their support network can trigger them to do some stupid and scary stuff (i.e. in 2012 when all my online devices were taken from me and I was being forced to attend school, I attempted suicide). So please - tread carefully and LISTEN TO YOUR DAUGHTER.\n\nSHE NEEDS HELP.\n\n**EDIT TO HELP OP: The thing that broke my addiction & cycle of truancy was a diagnosis (OCD), medication (SSRIs), and 3 months at an outpatient facility. I was 14/15 at the time. I struggled even after this time and was not fully \u201chealed\u201d until 23 (it never goes away, you just learn to properly manage). School was one of the most stupid things to me and I did not thrive until I started working and taking pride in what I do. Am now 26 and still have bad days but I am WAY better off and fully self sufficient.**", "NTA, but sounds like Kim needs an in-patient program. Look into one of those.", "NTA.  Have you spoken to her doctor/therapists about possible intensive inpatient therapy?\n\nI'm sorry this is going on.  Your daughter's online support group may be toxic. (just conjecture on my part)", "NTA but maybe talk to her therapist and see if they think it will help or hinder. And make sure her school work is downloaded from the previous day for her to work on.", "I'm leaning towards NTA. However, it could be causing done extra stress. It also might be worth seeing what she's doing with some monitor to see the usage. I say this because if she's just watching Netflix or movies then it could be a comfort thing (I like to watch Netflix when I'm not feeling great mentally or physically). It could also be something you could be missing that might be worth telling the psychologist. It's not uncommon now days for cyber bullying that can cause depression. Plus, things like TikTok and Instagram can produce ideas about unrealistic body images (they use filters and edit pictures to give more \"desirable\" appearanced). As a result of this, many teen girls develop body images issues that can lead to depression. Considering she isn't going to school, there may also be something about the school that's fueling the issues so it may be worth it to ask her if she would be more comfortable if she went to a different school as her answer could show a lot about what the issue is. I hope your family gets it worked out.", "NTA. You're doing what you think is best for her, and I really hope it works. I honestly wish my parents had been more involved when they noticed my mental health was in shambles instead of ignoring it.\n\nI'd talk to her therapist to know how to go about this, but i think you're in the right about taking her internet access away. \n\nMaybe taking her on walks in nature would be good. \n\nSide note, spending less time online is good for your mental health, a wild concept for reddit, I'm sure.", "NTA in any way.\n\nYou're a good father and loving parent.\n\nShe needs some help and its possible the internet is the worst possible thing for her, giving her an escape from the real world that she has become addicted to.\n\nEdit: Also your wife suggesting that changing the wifi password is equivalent to abuse...is hilarious and a slap in the face to anyone suffering real abuse.", " I understand your instincts but mental health is so tricky. She needs space, and supportive parents. Increasing therapy might be a good idea. INFO: what is her diagnosis? Meds?", "NTA.  Sounds like she's addicted to the Internet.   \nAsk her therapist if a stay in a no-Internet environment like Outward Bound or boarding school is a good idea.   I think it would be, but who am I, right?\nINFO:  She's not joining family meals, so is she eating?  I hope you aren't bringing her meals to eat in her room.", "NTA \n\nInternet addiction is real, and that\u2019s a huge problem we are all facing. Good job! She definitely has an addiction to the internet. Stay strong \ud83d\udcaa", "As someone who grew up on the internet starting at 13/14, I can tell you that having access to basically all human knowledge along with virtually unlimited entertainment options at a whim can indeed be addicting.\n\nMy parents were very frustrated with me when I was younger, and they took similar actions. Though they had to cope with a very tech savvy teenager who was able to work around their punishments, up to and including stealing my PC back out of their room when they weren't around.\n\nI can't give you advice on what to do about your daughter, and it sounds like she's going through way worse mental health problems than I ever really had to deal with. But spending 24/7 on a phone or laptop is not going to help solve the problem, that much I can promise. At least in my case I got into computers because I loved computers, and turned it into a wonderful career. But it doesn't sound like your daughter has any particular love for the technology, it sounds like it's just escapism.\n\nSide note: You can almost certainly save yourself some effort by simply limiting the times that your daughters devices can get out to the internet. The vast majority of home routers have such features, and it's a hell of a lot easier than changing the password over and over.", "NTA ! Do you live in the US ?

Buuut there\u2019s also way too much shit that could harm her there as well. As someone who was in Kim\u2019s position, I\u2019d suggest having all of you attend therapy to figure out helpful ways to assist Kim, maybe you\u2019ll find one that won\u2019t cut off her online life completely.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter is turning into a [NEET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET).

I was laid off from my job and became super depressed. I shut myself in my room. I had mountains of pizza boxes in my room and played video games all day. My friend enabled me by paying my portion of the rent for almost a year until we all moved out. I moved in with my parents and they practically kicked me out of the house during the day so that I wouldn't hole up inside my room.\n\nHad we not moved I doubt anything would have changed until my friend got fed up with me. In my state I was obliviously happy with my \"distraction\" from life. Giving your daughter unrestricted access to the internet is just going to give her her \"distraction\" back and things likely will not get better.", "NTA, this is a fairly normal tactic to work, and it is very hard to maintain.  There are software tools that can help, but nothing is perfect.", "NTA. Limiting her access to the internet when she's not doing her chores, not going to school, not doing her homework, and not participating in family meals is completely reasonable.", "I am going to go a little against the flow here and YTA. In this whole situation I can tell you that simply disallowing access to the internet is not at all going to help. I have also been in the receiving end of a close person telling me I'm not trying hard enough in therapy. My ex-fiance used to get mad at me because I wasn't making the progress she expected of me and accused me of not trying hard enough. I cannot stress how hurtful it is when you are giving it your all to get yourself out of a major funk or a lifetime of untreated anxiety then have the people who you most want to truly support you blame you for not trying. You need to be there for your daughter, support her and help her. The use of her phone or laptop while staying in bed could be a symptom of her mental health struggles. I know when I got really depressed or anxious all I wanted to do was curl up in bed. Sometimes I would just lay in the dark without my phone other times I would mindlessly scroll through my apps or social media.\n\nSo if you are truly worried about why she is just laying in bed and not even trying with her homework you might need to have a good conversation and actually listen to your daughter and let her speak freely. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT just expected her therapist to do everything or even push her to talk to her therapist about something and avoid talking to her. Again speaking from experience with my therapy and my ex this will only create resentment and anger. You need to be there to listen to her, you cannot solve the problem for her. She has to do that herself, but a shoulder to cry on, a ear to vent to and treated her like a normal adult will go a long way. And for the love of God please do not comment on how she is finally leaving her room or something like that. It is extremely awkward and can actually feel very embarrassing for her.", "Nta because depression is horrible.

Your post makes it seem as if she does get access, it just is not unlimited.\n\nI would look into a intensive outpatient therapy, inpatient would be last resort.

Instead, she\u2019ll spend her time laying in bed doing absolutely nothing. This isn\u2019t the tough love you think it is. Her depression is still there. It\u2019s not going away.

Seeing your child go through mental health struggles like this is hard, and I appreciate your dedication to understanding her struggles and supporting her, that's more than some parents do no matter how good they might be. However, mental health struggles take time  \n\n\nthe solution to this is cutting her off from the internet or her phone, I suggest speaking with her counselor and asking them what you can do to help. Look up genuine credible suggestions from mental health counselors like from sites like psychology today on what research has said helps with When she is having a rough day, maybe try and take her out to a park or something like that, go to a coffee shop. getting out of the house is very important and getting out in nature and exercising does wonders for mental health. what is she doing on her phone and computer? maybe try and connect with her on  her interests, maybe start up a family game night or movie night to get her out of her room. Animals also have been shown to do wonders for mental health. even if you cannot afford a pet, maybe try and get her to volunteer at the local animal shelter, volunteering in the cat shelter really helped me, and volunteering isn't as intimidating as getting a job.   \n\n\nAdditionally, ask her if her therapist is really fitting right with her. if you aren't seeing much improvement, which often is difficult to see at first or at all because of how it happens gradually, like losing weight or your hair growing, you don't notice the changes in the moment but they are more clear when you see a before and after photo. However, if she isn't clicking or connecting with her therapist then treatment will be difficult. Therapists isn't one-size-fits-all, some are better than others and, well, they are human beings. They all have different personalities and interests and though they may do their best to connect with everyone and treat every client, sometimes it just doesn't work out, it is a relationship after all.   \n\n\nI have been there before, I've struggled with mental health all my life and have a degree in psychology so I know more than some. I know how hard it can be to just do anything sometimes, no matter how much you know you should or how much you want to do it, even basic things like brushing your teeth can seem like running a marathon but being held accountable, and receiving encouragement from those around me helps a lot.", "YTA, but I think your heart is in the right place.\n\nKim is probably not ill because of the internet, in fact, from the sounds of it, it is probably one of the few places she feels free and happier, allowing her to escape from an unending black void. Removing that is a horrible thing to do.\n\nDepression, unfortunately, takes time and she needs to feel hope and connection and see a reason to try. While the support network line is clearly meant to be manipulative, it is also true. People have strong networks online that are just as real as in person friendships.\n\nNow, does that mean there's no problem with the internet usage? No. Social media apps can be terrible for your state of mind so stopping her using those (as long as she can still message and talk to friends) may not be a bad thing.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy 17-year-old daughter, Kim, is going through a hard time with her mental health.  It's gotten to a point where Kim refuses to go to school almost every single day.  In January, she went to school 4 days.  Total.  We've been working with the school to allow Kim to get homework digitally, but she doesn't keep up with it.   My wife and I have gotten her into therapy as well as counseling through her school last fall, but results of that have been mixed as I don't think Kim is putting in the necessary work on her end.  She is on medication, but we're still working with her doctor to find the right combination to meet her needs.\n\nIf Kim had her way, she'd just spend all day in bed with her laptop.  She doesn't do anything to help around the house, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, doesn't eat meals with the family, just sits in her room on her computer all day and all night.  We've tried so many different things and nothing has seemed to make any positive change.  It's infuriating and heartbreaking at the same time.  \n\nOne constant throughout all of this has been her computer and phone.  She's on them constantly.  No matter how many times we bring this up to her that maybe she needs to spend less time in front of a screen, she insists that isn't the cause of her problems.  \n\nSo, finally I decided to start changing our WiFi password to one that only my wife and I know.  I change it every night before we go to sleep and don't change it back to the one the kids know until after we get home from work.  Kim was not happy about this and used up all of our family plan data in less than a week.  We had to change our plan to restrict her usage.  At first, my wife was on board with this as she also felt that Kim was spending too much time on her phone and computer.  But after Kim basically through a gigantic tantrum about it, my wife is not so sure.\n\nKim tried to use the argument that if we want her to do school work at home, she needs the internet.  But she wasn't doing the work anyway so that argument didn't really hold water for me.  She tried saying that she needs the internet to have access to her support network, but we take her to therapy and counseling in person and I feel if she put more effort into those, then maybe she would make some progress.  \n\nKim hates me for this and told me that restricting her internet access in this day and age is abuse.  My wife is also wavering on this idea because Kim isn't showing any positive changes and still isn't going to school.  \n\nEvery single day is an emotional roller coaster for me.

Good luck.", "I don't think you're the AH but I think there is something deeper than mental health going on here.\n\nTo me it sounds like there is a biological component. She sounds exactly like me when I was in college and had undiagnosed Lyme disease. Undiagnosed and untreated Lyme can cause serious fatigue, lack of motivation, depression, and anxiety but it will not respond to traditional mental health treatments because it's caused by a bacteria living in the body and brain. A lot of people see those with untreated Lyme as \"lazy\". When really they're chronically exhausted. No amount of therapy is going to kill a bacteria.  \n\nIf you seek to pursue this, I would recommend googling a Lyme Literate Medical Doctor (LLMD) in your area. Regular docs don't know about Lyme or how to treat it properly. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA - I think this is good parenting.", "NTA", "NTA as a short term solution but there is more work to do. I had mental health issues and school phobia when I was her age. I would have been really angry if my parents did this to me but now that I\u2019m almost 30 I can recognize that it would have absolutely been what was best for me. I would suggest working with her therapist and all other providers to best deal with this. There needs to be a comprehensive plan to get her back on track and she needs to be a part of making this plan.   \n  \nIn eighth grade I stopped going to school and eventually received homebound services (a teacher would come twice a week to work with me then the other days I did individual work) while we worked with my psychiatrist to figure out a medication combination that worked. Your daughter may need a period of time where she does this sort of thing. I\u2019m not sure if she is a junior or a senior, but if she is a junior maybe she could finish out this year and work towards a goal of going back to school in the fall. That\u2019s what we did with me going back to school in ninth grade. For me personally homeschool was never a long term solution because I was fully avoiding the world. I needed to be back in school to overcome my issues. It might be the same for your daughter or it might not. She should have internet access on a single device with strict parental controls so she can do her classwork. Once she has finished her work for the day (and you or your wife have verified this) she can have full access. Depending on how far behind she\u2019s fallen there may need to be a plan of what needs to be done each day (with a little wiggle room because she will have bad days) to get her caught up. Maybe there are some assignments that can be left out and focus on the most important ones, or maybe she can do an alternative assignment. This will help her not be as overwhelmed. When you\u2019ve gotten behind and missed that much school it\u2019s scary and you know it will be hard so you just want to keep avoiding it. When the apathy and exhaustion of depression are mixed in it can feel impossible. Depending on how much her school is willing to work with you, you may need to get the special education department involved. If you are in the USA some terms to google to learn more are IDEA, section 504, and IEP. I had an IEP all through high school that addressed everything from what accommodations I was allowed (I could leave class to go to the school psychologist whenever I needed to, I got first period off due to sleep problems, etc) to what would happen if I stopped attending school again and how I would make up time when I missed so many days I ended up in truancy court (which happened every year).  \n  \nYou sound like a really good parent who wants what is best for your daughter and I respect you for that. Keep being her biggest supporter even when she can\u2019t see it. Remind her that you will always be there and that you love her no matter what but also keep her accountable. She will hate you sometimes but hopefully she can (or will someday) see that you are doing what is necessary to get her through this difficult time. I don\u2019t know where I would be if my parents didn\u2019t do this for me. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be an independent adult living fully on my own with a college degree and a career. I still have my issues and I\u2019m still on medication but I have a real life and I\u2019m proud of how far I\u2019ve come. I\u2019m not afraid to be a part of the world anymore. If you have any questions feel free to message me.  \n  \nOne more thing to add. Make sure she knows that it\u2019s okay to not click with a therapist. I didn\u2019t like my first therapist- we didn\u2019t click and I couldn\u2019t open up to her. I felt like I was doing something wrong so I hid it hoping things would change until I finally admitted it to my mom. She was like why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? Finding a therapist is like dating- you need to give someone a try to see if it will work. If things aren\u2019t clicking within 3 to 4 sessions and your daughter is actually trying, it\u2019s time to move on. The ideal therapist is someone she trusts to open up to but also someone who can push her without making her feel attacked. For me I like a warm, motherly sort of person that is also no bullshit. Call me out when I need it but make it feel like it\u2019s coming from a place of love. If you haven\u2019t already you might want to research providers who specialize in adolescent therapy and psychiatry. I would also suggest a full depth evaluation by a clinical psychologist who also specializes in adolescents. The kind where they do a bunch of different testing over several days, talk to her and other family members, consult with her teachers, etc. If money is an issue the school can be forced to pay for it under special education.

I really don't have a true unbiased opinion on that. I just believe like a lot of things it comes down to how the person uses it.", "It absolutely is. Which is why they should be getting more treatment. Not necessarily to an inpatient level. Inpatient experiences for teens and children can be traumatic and are generally not advised unless there are comorbidities.", "I mean this kindly, as I\u2019m trying to understand. \n\nThe internet addiction described in the post sounds serious. I think I have comparisons and I\u2019m curious what you think: If OP\u2019s child was in their room masturbating most of the day (internet/none) or smoking pot or drinking alcohol or eating to gain 600lbs, would you be saying \u201cTime and patience?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m struggling to see the topic as any different. It feels like letting someone wallow in the internet for 3 years is like letting a child wander into a cave with no tools, and waiting/hoping for the kid to make it out of the dave system. Sounds barbaric and not helpful.", "The way you're thinking and approaching this is the fundamental problem.\n\nThe handful of people who have been where your daughter is are screaming at the top of our lungs what you need to do, and your response is the opposite every time. Because school. Because other kids. Because how this situation makes YOU feel. Because because because nonsense.\n\nI'm so sorry that what you need to do is actually the exact opposite of what you want to do. I am so sorry that it is difficult and challenging and sets a \"bad example\" for your other kids that you might actually put your daughter's legitimate mental health above arbitrary things like school work and chores.\n\nI'm begging you to listen to the people who have been where she is and telling you how what you're doing is going to be a disaster. Please.", "I was sent to live with my grandmother, and lost 95% access to internet, phone use and social media. For TWO years. My grandma put me in therapy, got me on meds, started me on the path of volunteering (I worked with animals). At one point I did a outpatient, intensive therapy for 6 months.\n\nIt helped.", "I'm not pissed at you, sorry if it comes across that way. I am trying to emphasize the importance of your help and support she needs. Work together with her to really determine what she feels she needs to get over this mental health issue. Some people take years to improve, and I hate to break it to you, but mental health issues will never go away. She has a set of coping mechanisms for the mental issues. Over time with the help of therapy and proper medication she will be able to transform her coping mechanisms into positive ones and get better and avoiding the pitfalls. The best way to actually judge of she really does need that insensitive of treatment is to work with her. Ask her ways to help, ask her if there are things you are doing that are making it harder, and build up a strong non-judgmental relationship between you, her and her goals. If she trusts you enough you might even ask to sit in on a therapy session if she is okay with it. Just make sure through the whole process you listen to her and help her, don't try to drive conversations about it, or tell her how she should respond.\n\nAs for getting pissed at people, the only people I get angry at are the people who tell you to get over it or just push the problem off onto someone else. I actually respect you for everything you are trying to do to help her. You just need patience. For my problems it took me around 4 years of a mix of week and biweekly therapy sessions, 3 different therapist, 2 different meds including various dosages, a psychiatrist for the meds, and honestly the end of an engagement to get to where I am at now. It's going to be a very long road, and very difficult work for her to improve. She really does need you more than ever right now.", "That's... not a long time? For therapy. For mental health. It can take a lifetime. It's totally subjective. Which sucks, I get it. But the most important thing is patience and love.", "To be completely honest with you, I actually wish my parents had done even half of what you've done for your daughter. It may not have taken me 30 years to get the help I so desperately needed but never knew I needed. I think back to my childhood and there was one single conversation with my Dr that if my mom had not controlled, I've talked about it now and she was just trying to help, that might have been that pivotal moment as teen and who knows how my life would be different. You are bending over backwards trying to help her, and that is huge for her right now.", "that's long enough you should be seeing at least a glimmer of improvement imo\n\nare y'all in family therapy too?", "Remember, OP is allowing her to go online in the evening hours. And, this is a teenager, not an adult.\n\nLetting your teen go online at all hours is abdicating parental responsibility. There are far better coping mechanisms for mental health issues than watching tiktok or doomscrolling reddit.", "So, to be clear, given everything you just said, it's your opinion that OP should give wi-fi back to his daughter?", "Yes. This. Thank you.", "Daughter has not shown any signs of internet addiction in this post. Why do you think its comparable?", "she blew their phone data for the month in a a period of days after having the wifi taken away", "> If Kim had her way, she'd just spend all day in bed with her laptop. She doesn't do anything to help around the house, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, doesn't eat meals with the family, just sits in her room on her computer all day and all night.", "Uh, yes, she has."]}
