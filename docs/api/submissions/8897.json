It's gotten to a point where Kim refuses to go to school almost every single day.  In January, she went to school 4 days.  Total.  We've been working with the school to allow Kim to get homework digitally, but she doesn't keep up with it.   My wife and I have gotten her into therapy as well as counseling through her school last fall, but results of that have been mixed as I don't think Kim is putting in the necessary work on her end.  She is on medication, but we're still working with her doctor to find the right combination to meet her needs.\n\nIf Kim had her way, she'd just spend all day in bed with her laptop.  She doesn't do anything to help around the house, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, doesn't eat meals with the family, just sits in her room on her computer all day and all night.  We've tried so many different things and nothing has seemed to make any positive change.  It's infuriating and heartbreaking at the same time.  \n\nOne constant throughout all of this has been her computer and phone.  She's on them constantly.  No matter how many times we bring this up to her that maybe she needs to spend less time in front of a screen, she insists that isn't the cause of her problems.  \n\nSo, finally I decided to start changing our WiFi password to one that only my wife and I know.  I change it every night before we go to sleep and don't change it back to the one the kids know until after we get home from work.  Kim was not happy about this and used up all of our family plan data in less than a week.  We had to change our plan to restrict her usage.  At first, my wife was on board with this as she also felt that Kim was spending too much time on her phone and computer.  But after Kim basically through a gigantic tantrum about it, my wife is not so sure.\n\nKim tried to use the argument that if we want her to do school work at home, she needs the internet.  But she wasn't doing the work anyway so that argument didn't really hold water for me.  She tried saying that she needs the internet to have access to her support network, but we take her to therapy and counseling in person and I feel if she put more effort into those, then maybe she would make some progress.  \n\nKim hates me for this and told me that restricting her internet access in this day and age is abuse.  My wife is also wavering on this idea because Kim isn't showing any positive changes and still isn't going to school.  \n\nEvery single day is an emotional roller coaster for me.  Anger, frustration, embarrassment, futility, failure, fear.  I know Kim is struggling and seeing your child go through something that you can't fix is a hell I wouldn't wish on anybody.  \n\nAll I'm trying to do is gently force Kim to focus on her issues and take steps necessary to address them and make progress towards being a functional adult.  She has 3 acceptance letters to colleges that she is very unlikely to attend now.", "created_utc": 1675287923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r770e/aita_for_changing_the_wifi_password_every_day/", "score": 1448, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is using her addiction to her devices to hide from her feelings. \n\nBut, in my opinion, you are right to take steps to help your children manage their addictions while they are minors. We are struggling with similar issues in our household. Phones are addictive. They are designed to be addictive. But they're also socially acceptable, and necessary, so it's complicated. If I ever figure it out, I'll let you know.", "INFO: What kind of diagnosis does she have? What medications have you tried? Have you asked her if she feels she has a good connection with her therapist? There are so many factors here. \n\nI have ADHD and didn't get diagnosed until my late 20s. I could spend all day staring at a screen *knowing* I had school work but unable to force my brain to focus on it. Not because I'm lazy, not because I didn't want to, but simply because of a neurodevelopmental that results in my brain not processing certain neurochemicals correctly. Getting a diagnosis, medication, and a good therapist have helped, but sometimes it's still a struggle. \n\nYour daughter's screen time might be a symptom, not the cause of the problem. \n\nHave you asked if she wants to switch schools? Maybe something traumatic happened that she isn't comfortable sharing? \n\nShe's 17, can she enroll in a GED program? \n\nHelp her figure out how to defer her college admission offers for a year so she has a chance to sort out her mental health.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA because this is an impossible situation and I really feel for all of you.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible that your daughter\u2019s support network is online. It\u2019s also very possible that this is toxic and could be detrimental to her mental health. Without actually speaking with her, it\u2019s impossible to know.\n\nSo that she\u2019s not held back with support and school work, could you allow her wifi access with parental controls on it? If it was me, I\u2019d be looking to block access to any potentially harmful material (not saying that she does, but as an example, if she had an ED, I\u2019d block access to pro-Ana websites). It might be worth exploring this with her and her therapist to find a way that she can use it for support but in a healthy way and ensure that she\u2019s not being bullied online or anything.\n\nMore than anything though, you need to *show* her your unconditional love for her. Tell her you love her and often. Talk to her, and more than that, LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS (both verbally and non verbally). She sounds as if she might have pretty severe depression so you need to show her that you\u2019re being supportive and not punishing her by removing her access to the internet, but protect her from harm. \n\nSeek professional support for yourself too, you\u2019ll need someone to support yourself as you navigate through this together.", "What does her therapist say?\n\nEdit: if you're (OP, mother and daughter) not in family therapy,  get in it.  I see nothing but a wedge opening and your daughter further rebelling despite your good intentions.  How many high school kids respond well to this kind of \"force\"?", "What Kim is doing is obviously unhealthy. You need to ask the professionals if limiting her Internet use is the best way to help her. I suspect they'll say yes.", "INFO:  What does Kim's therapist say about her internet usage and your solution?", "NTA but I'm joining with some of the voices here saying Kim May need more intensive intervention than just therapy and limited internet. An inpatient treatment program may be necessary to get more to the root of her issues and break the internet addiction/reliance.", "You need to set aside your feelings of anger, embarrassment, etc. Your daughter's mental health issues mean that her brain does not reach the same conclusions your brain does. What seems obvious or sensible to you does not seem the same way to her.\n\nThat said, you've got a point that giving her Internet access so that she can do her homework is pointless if she doesn't actually do her homework. And, if she were to attend school, I assume they would not let her spend all day glued to her phone and laptop.\n\nINFO: What is she actually doing on her screens? Watching videos? Playing games? Interacting with other people?", "NTA. \n\nIf you enable her, she may never shake it. She's young and neurally plastic enough that this is the time for her to heal and get a handle on her issues. Letting her be a lump, and facilitating it, can rob her of her functional adulthood for life.\n\nShe needs to learn that there won't always be mummy and daddy around to scrape her off the floor.", "NTA \n\nHave you looked at a private inhouse facility? \n\nWhen I went through hell and back I found a place to go for a 4 week inpatient stay. They had Psychiatric assistance, great food, was a low needs facility. You attended a class daily. You got your meds worked on and changed to suit you. \n\nSometimes the professionals can help. And low needs means lots of other struggling people in a similar situation \n\nTalk to some professionals around you and see what has a good reputation", "I honestly don\u2019t feel right to judge this situation, because it\u2019s complex as hell. I\u2019d honestly try to get a hold of her therapist and tell them that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing the right thing or only making things worse for Kim. \nMaybe you don\u2019t and we judge you as N T A and Kim only slips further away. \nTry talking to her therapist and don\u2019t feel embarrassed. I wish you, your family and Kim only the best.", "NAH. Hey there. This is like looking in a mirror at my younger self. Firstly, let me say I recognize how absolutely hard this is for you, your daughter, your family, and I am beyond relieved that you are actively seeking help.\n\nWhen your daughter says her support network is online, I believe that. Whatever her hobbies/interests, the internet infinitely multiplies the number of people you can meet who share those interests. She may have stronger relationships with people online than she does in person. In fact, she may ONLY have online relationships that fulfill her and that motivate her as peers do.\n\nThe thing about school is that it only works if you maintain the balance of peer to peer social dynamics. You feel the pressure to relate and match your peers, better your rivals, improve your self to outdo those who you don\u2019t like.\n\nBut if her peers, her REAL friends, are all online then she has stepped out of the social dynamic that makes school both consciously and subconsciously purposeful.\n\nAs such, school is pointless. Why do the work when none of the people you truly care about benefit from it. As a teenager, her hierarchy of needs is solely fixated on her feeling of \u201cbelonging\u201d. Additionally, if she\u2019s being bullied or feels like and outcast, it reinforces her decision to remain truant. Kids with mental health issues still found ways to exit this social dynamic in the past when the internet didn\u2019t exist - they were gangsters, greasers, stoners, basement dwellers, punks, etc. Same problem, different era.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to chat more, I was once in the same exact place as your daughter.\n\nMy advice to you would be to try and get involved with her online circle. Get them support her or encourage her to do what\u2019s good for her. They are real relationships and if you \u201cturn them off\u201d by restricting her access, it would be the same as preventing her from seeing friends/loved ones. But if it\u2019s an echo chamber, it may be the exact thing making her feel like her decisions are valid. For a person in a dark place, pulling away their support network can trigger them to do some stupid and scary stuff (i.e. in 2012 when all my online devices were taken from me and I was being forced to attend school, I attempted suicide). So please - tread carefully and LISTEN TO YOUR DAUGHTER.\n\nSHE NEEDS HELP.\n\n**EDIT TO HELP OP: The thing that broke my addiction & cycle of truancy was a diagnosis (OCD), medication (SSRIs), and 3 months at an outpatient facility. I was 14/15 at the time. I struggled even after this time and was not fully \u201chealed\u201d until 23 (it never goes away, you just learn to properly manage). School was one of the most stupid things to me and I did not thrive until I started working and taking pride in what I do. Am now 26 and still have bad days but I am WAY better off and fully self sufficient.**", "NTA, but sounds like Kim needs an in-patient program. Look into one of those.", "NTA.  Have you spoken to her doctor/therapists about possible intensive inpatient therapy?\n\nI'm sorry this is going on.  Your daughter's online support group may be toxic. (just conjecture on my part)", "NTA but maybe talk to her therapist and see if they think it will help or hinder. And make sure her school work is downloaded from the previous day for her to work on.", "I'm leaning towards NTA. However, it could be causing done extra stress. It also might be worth seeing what she's doing with some monitor to see the usage. I say this because if she's just watching Netflix or movies then it could be a comfort thing (I like to watch Netflix when I'm not feeling great mentally or physically). It could also be something you could be missing that might be worth telling the psychologist. It's not uncommon now days for cyber bullying that can cause depression. Plus, things like TikTok and Instagram can produce ideas about unrealistic body images (they use filters and edit pictures to give more \"desirable\" appearanced). As a result of this, many teen girls develop body images issues that can lead to depression. Considering she isn't going to school, there may also be something about the school that's fueling the issues so it may be worth it to ask her if she would be more comfortable if she went to a different school as her answer could show a lot about what the issue is. I hope your family gets it worked out.", "NTA. You're doing what you think is best for her, and I really hope it works. I honestly wish my parents had been more involved when they noticed my mental health was in shambles instead of ignoring it.\n\nI'd talk to her therapist to know how to go about this, but i think you're in the right about taking her internet access away. \n\nMaybe taking her on walks in nature would be good. \n\nSide note, spending less time online is good for your mental health, a wild concept for reddit, I'm sure.", "NTA in any way.\n\nYou're a good father and loving parent.\n\nShe needs some help and its possible the internet is the worst possible thing for her, giving her an escape from the real world that she has become addicted to.\n\nEdit: Also your wife suggesting that changing the wifi password is equivalent to abuse...is hilarious and a slap in the face to anyone suffering real abuse.", " I understand your instincts but mental health is so tricky. She needs space, and supportive parents. Increasing therapy might be a good idea. INFO: what is her diagnosis? Meds?", "NTA.  Sounds like she's addicted to the Internet.   \nAsk her therapist if a stay in a no-Internet environment like Outward Bound or boarding school is a good idea.   I think it would be, but who am I, right?\nINFO:  She's not joining family meals, so is she eating?  I hope you aren't bringing her meals to eat in her room.", "NTA \n\nInternet addiction is real, and that\u2019s a huge problem we are all facing. Good job! She definitely has an addiction to the internet. Stay strong \ud83d\udcaa", "As someone who grew up on the internet starting at 13/14, I can tell you that having access to basically all human knowledge along with virtually unlimited entertainment options at a whim can indeed be addicting.\n\nMy parents were very frustrated with me when I was younger, and they took similar actions. Though they had to cope with a very tech savvy teenager who was able to work around their punishments, up to and including stealing my PC back out of their room when they weren't around.\n\nI can't give you advice on what to do about your daughter, and it sounds like she's going through way worse mental health problems than I ever really had to deal with. But spending 24/7 on a phone or laptop is not going to help solve the problem, that much I can promise. At least in my case I got into computers because I loved computers, and turned it into a wonderful career. But it doesn't sound like your daughter has any particular love for the technology, it sounds like it's just escapism.\n\nSide note: You can almost certainly save yourself some effort by simply limiting the times that your daughters devices can get out to the internet. The vast majority of home routers have such features, and it's a hell of a lot easier than changing the password over and over.", "NTA ! Do you live in the US ? Yk you can be put in jail and/ or fined if she doesn\u2019t go right ? I was that kid that was late every day and 3 lates equals 1 absence where I am.

Buuut there\u2019s also way too much shit that could harm her there as well. As someone who was in Kim\u2019s position, I\u2019d suggest having all of you attend therapy to figure out helpful ways to assist Kim, maybe you\u2019ll find one that won\u2019t cut off her online life completely.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter is turning into a [NEET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET).

I was laid off from my job and became super depressed. I shut myself in my room. I had mountains of pizza boxes in my room and played video games all day. My friend enabled me by paying my portion of the rent for almost a year until we all moved out. I moved in with my parents and they practically kicked me out of the house during the day so that I wouldn't hole up inside my room.\n\nHad we not moved I doubt anything would have changed until my friend got fed up with me. In my state I was obliviously happy with my \"distraction\" from life. Giving your daughter unrestricted access to the internet is just going to give her her \"distraction\" back and things likely will not get better.", "NTA, this is a fairly normal tactic to work, and it is very hard to maintain.  There are software tools that can help, but nothing is perfect.", "NTA. Limiting her access to the internet when she's not doing her chores, not going to school, not doing her homework, and not participating in family meals is completely reasonable.", "I am going to go a little against the flow here and YTA. In this whole situation I can tell you that simply disallowing access to the internet is not at all going to help. I have also been in the receiving end of a close person telling me I'm not trying hard enough in therapy. My ex-fiance used to get mad at me because I wasn't making the progress she expected of me and accused me of not trying hard enough. I cannot stress how hurtful it is when you are giving it your all to get yourself out of a major funk or a lifetime of untreated anxiety then have the people who you most want to truly support you blame you for not trying. You need to be there for your daughter, support her and help her. The use of her phone or laptop while staying in bed could be a symptom of her mental health struggles. I know when I got really depressed or anxious all I wanted to do was curl up in bed. Sometimes I would just lay in the dark without my phone other times I would mindlessly scroll through my apps or social media.\n\nSo if you are truly worried about why she is just laying in bed and not even trying with her homework you might need to have a good conversation and actually listen to your daughter and let her speak freely. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT just expected her therapist to do everything or even push her to talk to her therapist about something and avoid talking to her. Again speaking from experience with my therapy and my ex this will only create resentment and anger. You need to be there to listen to her, you cannot solve the problem for her. She has to do that herself, but a shoulder to cry on, a ear to vent to and treated her like a normal adult will go a long way. And for the love of God please do not comment on how she is finally leaving her room or something like that. It is extremely awkward and can actually feel very embarrassing for her.", "Nta because depression is horrible.

Sadly you won't know unless you snoop through her phone/laptop which is a different beast to tackle morality on.", "NTA. Excessive screen time will make depression worse. Your post makes it seem as if she does get access, it just is not unlimited.\n\nI would look into a intensive outpatient therapy, inpatient would be last resort.

Instead, she\u2019ll spend her time laying in bed doing absolutely nothing. This isn\u2019t the tough love you think it is. Her depression is still there. It\u2019s not going away.

Seeing your child go through mental health struggles like this is hard, and I appreciate your dedication to understanding her struggles and supporting her, that's more than some parents do no matter how good they might be. However, mental health struggles take time  \n\n\nthe solution to this is cutting her off from the internet or her phone, I suggest speaking with her counselor and asking them what you can do to help. Look up genuine credible suggestions from mental health counselors like from sites like psychology today on what research has said helps with When she is having a rough day, maybe try and take her out to a park or something like that, go to a coffee shop. getting out of the house is very important and getting out in nature and exercising does wonders for mental health. what is she doing on her phone and computer? maybe try and connect with her on  her interests, maybe start up a family game night or movie night to get her out of her room. Animals also have been shown to do wonders for mental health. even if you cannot afford a pet, maybe try and get her to volunteer at the local animal shelter, volunteering in the cat shelter really helped me, and volunteering isn't as intimidating as getting a job.   \n\n\nAdditionally, ask her if her therapist is really fitting right with her. if you aren't seeing much improvement, which often is difficult to see at first or at all because of how it happens gradually, like losing weight or your hair growing, you don't notice the changes in the moment but they are more clear when you see a before and after photo. However, if she isn't clicking or connecting with her therapist then treatment will be difficult. Therapists isn't one-size-fits-all, some are better than others and, well, they are human beings. They all have different personalities and interests and though they may do their best to connect with everyone and treat every client, sometimes it just doesn't work out, it is a relationship after all.   \n\n\nI have been there before, I've struggled with mental health all my life and have a degree in psychology so I know more than some. I know how hard it can be to just do anything sometimes, no matter how much you know you should or how much you want to do it, even basic things like brushing your teeth can seem like running a marathon but being held accountable, and receiving encouragement from those around me helps a lot.", "YTA, but I think your heart is in the right place.\n\nKim is probably not ill because of the internet, in fact, from the sounds of it, it is probably one of the few places she feels free and happier, allowing her to escape from an unending black void. Removing that is a horrible thing to do.\n\nDepression, unfortunately, takes time and she needs to feel hope and connection and see a reason to try. While the support network line is clearly meant to be manipulative, it is also true. People have strong networks online that are just as real as in person friendships.\n\nNow, does that mean there's no problem with the internet usage? No. Social media apps can be terrible for your state of mind so stopping her using those (as long as she can still message and talk to friends) may not be a bad thing.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's gotten to a point where Kim refuses to go to school almost every single day.  In January, she went to school 4 days.  Total.  We've been working with the school to allow Kim to get homework digitally, but she doesn't keep up with it.   My wife and I have gotten her into therapy as well as counseling through her school last fall, but results of that have been mixed as I don't think Kim is putting in the necessary work on her end.  She is on medication, but we're still working with her doctor to find the right combination to meet her needs.\n\nIf Kim had her way, she'd just spend all day in bed with her laptop.  She doesn't do anything to help around the house, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, doesn't eat meals with the family, just sits in her room on her computer all day and all night.

It's infuriating and heartbreaking at the same time.  \n\nOne constant throughout all of this has been her computer and phone.  She's on them constantly.  No matter how many times we bring this up to her that maybe she needs to spend less time in front of a screen, she insists that isn't the cause of her problems.  \n\nSo, finally I decided to start changing our WiFi password to one that only my wife and I know.  I change it every night before we go to sleep and don't change it back to the one the kids know until after we get home from work.

At first, my wife was on board with this as she also felt that Kim was spending too much time on her phone and computer.  But after Kim basically through a gigantic tantrum about it, my wife is not so sure.\n\nKim tried to use the argument that if we want her to do school work at home, she needs the internet.

She tried saying that she needs the internet to have access to her support network, but we take her to therapy and counseling in person and I feel if she put more effort into those, then maybe she would make some progress.  \n\nKim hates me for this and told me that restricting her internet access in this day and age is abuse.  My wife is also wavering on this idea because Kim isn't showing any positive changes and still isn't going to school.  \n\nEvery single day is an emotional roller coaster for me.  Anger, frustration, embarrassment, futility, failure, fear.  I know Kim is struggling and seeing your child go through something that you can't fix is a hell I wouldn't wish on anybody.  \n\nAll I'm trying to do is gently force Kim to focus on her issues and take steps necessary to address them and make progress towards being a functional adult.  She has 3 acceptance letters to colleges that she is very unlikely to attend now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good luck.", "I don't think you're the AH but I think there is something deeper than mental health going on here.\n\nTo me it sounds like there is a biological component. She sounds exactly like me when I was in college and had undiagnosed Lyme disease. Undiagnosed and untreated Lyme can cause serious fatigue, lack of motivation, depression, and anxiety but it will not respond to traditional mental health treatments because it's caused by a bacteria living in the body and brain. A lot of people see those with untreated Lyme as \"lazy\". When really they're chronically exhausted. No amount of therapy is going to kill a bacteria.  \n\nIf you seek to pursue this, I would recommend googling a Lyme Literate Medical Doctor (LLMD) in your area. Regular docs don't know about Lyme or how to treat it properly. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA - I think this is good parenting.", "NTA", "NTA as a short term solution but there is more work to do. I had mental health issues and school phobia when I was her age. I would have been really angry if my parents did this to me but now that I\u2019m almost 30 I can recognize that it would have absolutely been what was best for me. I would suggest working with her therapist and all other providers to best deal with this. There needs to be a comprehensive plan to get her back on track and she needs to be a part of making this plan.   \n  \nIn eighth grade I stopped going to school and eventually received homebound services (a teacher would come twice a week to work with me then the other days I did individual work) while we worked with my psychiatrist to figure out a medication combination that worked. Your daughter may need a period of time where she does this sort of thing. I\u2019m not sure if she is a junior or a senior, but if she is a junior maybe she could finish out this year and work towards a goal of going back to school in the fall. That\u2019s what we did with me going back to school in ninth grade. For me personally homeschool was never a long term solution because I was fully avoiding the world. I needed to be back in school to overcome my issues. It might be the same for your daughter or it might not. She should have internet access on a single device with strict parental controls so she can do her classwork. Once she has finished her work for the day (and you or your wife have verified this) she can have full access. Depending on how far behind she\u2019s fallen there may need to be a plan of what needs to be done each day (with a little wiggle room because she will have bad days) to get her caught up. Maybe there are some assignments that can be left out and focus on the most important ones, or maybe she can do an alternative assignment. This will help her not be as overwhelmed. When you\u2019ve gotten behind and missed that much school it\u2019s scary and you know it will be hard so you just want to keep avoiding it. When the apathy and exhaustion of depression are mixed in it can feel impossible. Depending on how much her school is willing to work with you, you may need to get the special education department involved. If you are in the USA some terms to google to learn more are IDEA, section 504, and IEP. I had an IEP all through high school that addressed everything from what accommodations I was allowed (I could leave class to go to the school psychologist whenever I needed to, I got first period off due to sleep problems, etc) to what would happen if I stopped attending school again and how I would make up time when I missed so many days I ended up in truancy court (which happened every year).  \n  \nYou sound like a really good parent who wants what is best for your daughter and I respect you for that. Keep being her biggest supporter even when she can\u2019t see it. Remind her that you will always be there and that you love her no matter what but also keep her accountable. She will hate you sometimes but hopefully she can (or will someday) see that you are doing what is necessary to get her through this difficult time. I don\u2019t know where I would be if my parents didn\u2019t do this for me. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be an independent adult living fully on my own with a college degree and a career. I still have my issues and I\u2019m still on medication but I have a real life and I\u2019m proud of how far I\u2019ve come. I\u2019m not afraid to be a part of the world anymore. If you have any questions feel free to message me.  \n  \nOne more thing to add. Make sure she knows that it\u2019s okay to not click with a therapist. I didn\u2019t like my first therapist- we didn\u2019t click and I couldn\u2019t open up to her. I felt like I was doing something wrong so I hid it hoping things would change until I finally admitted it to my mom. She was like why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? Finding a therapist is like dating- you need to give someone a try to see if it will work. If things aren\u2019t clicking within 3 to 4 sessions and your daughter is actually trying, it\u2019s time to move on. The ideal therapist is someone she trusts to open up to but also someone who can push her without making her feel attacked. For me I like a warm, motherly sort of person that is also no bullshit. Call me out when I need it but make it feel like it\u2019s coming from a place of love. If you haven\u2019t already you might want to research providers who specialize in adolescent therapy and psychiatry. I would also suggest a full depth evaluation by a clinical psychologist who also specializes in adolescents. The kind where they do a bunch of different testing over several days, talk to her and other family members, consult with her teachers, etc. If money is an issue the school can be forced to pay for it under special education.

Because because because nonsense.\n\nI'm so sorry that what you need to do is actually the exact opposite of what you want to do. I am so sorry that it is difficult and challenging and sets a \"bad example\" for your other kids that you might actually put your daughter's legitimate mental health above arbitrary things like school work and chores.\n\nI'm begging you to listen to the people who have been where she is and telling you how what you're doing is going to be a disaster.

I am trying to emphasize the importance of your help and support she needs. Work together with her to really determine what she feels she needs to get over this mental health issue. Some people take years to improve, and I hate to break it to you, but mental health issues will never go away. She has a set of coping mechanisms for the mental issues. Over time with the help of therapy and proper medication she will be able to transform her coping mechanisms into positive ones and get better and avoiding the pitfalls. The best way to actually judge of she really does need that insensitive of treatment is to work with her. Ask her ways to help, ask her if there are things you are doing that are making it harder, and build up a strong non-judgmental relationship between you, her and her goals. If she trusts you enough you might even ask to sit in on a therapy session if she is okay with it. Just make sure through the whole process you listen to her and help her, don't try to drive conversations about it, or tell her how she should respond.\n\nAs for getting pissed at people, the only people I get angry at are the people who tell you to get over it or just push the problem off onto someone else. I actually respect you for everything you are trying to do to help her. You just need patience.

We also don't hear much about the wife's perspective other than agreeing or not to something.  **It is incredibly clear that the entire family should also be doing therapy together.**\n\nSomething to add: it's worth talking to the daughter and asking why therapy isn't helping her.  Does she not like the therapist or their advice?  Those things happen.  If you don't have the right fit, things will not work out.  Sometimes therapists are simply bad or give terrible advice too.", "ESH, but kind of also no one does, because mental health is fucking hard. You need to talk with her therapist and get a plan together. Letting everything slide isn't going to work, but cutting off the only thing she likes isn't going to help, either. Your family is not equipped to deal with this. And if her therapist isn't helping, get a new therapist. Get into family treatment.\n\nAnd don't be so judgey at your kid.

I ended up dropping out of school due to severe depression. Depression is too complex for me to say it was only tied to one thing, but for me it started due to a couple events in my life that badly shook my self confidence. I desperately needed support and love to get through it - but my parents were just angry at me for showing symptoms of depression, and focused on punishing me for not functioning properly instead of listening to why I felt that way or how much I was struggling. It made my battle with depression much worse than it would\u2019ve been otherwise. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with Kim or you, but I do think listening to her from a place of trying to understand is going to be crucial to getting her out of this funk, and I can\u2019t give a judgment without knowing her feelings about her life.", "NTA\n\nBut explain the process to her.

Even just an IOP or partial program (where she would stay at home but go to the hospital during the day) would probably make a huge difference. There are also therapeutic schools and residential programs with medical supervision.

And that\u2019s the thing\u2014in the real world, where communication and community building is dependent on showing up, depression can royally screw with your ability to find community to protect you for yourself.

You mention medication, if Kim doesn't seem to be benefiting from the meds she is currently on it may be time to ask her about whether or not she wants to talk to her psychiatrist about trying a different class of meds, I ended up failing over 20 meds before trying an MAOI which has worked wonderfully. If she is trying a variety of meds and nothing is working it may be worthwhile to get a CYP450 panel and see if she has difficulties metabolizing certain medications which is the case for my sister and I. \n\nAs far as therapy goes you may want to ask Kim if she feels she is benefitting from her current therapy or if she wants to try sessions with a different therapist, maybe a different modality like DBT instead of the usual CBT. You and the other members of the family should probably get into therapy as well, thus is obviously stressful for you and may be confusing for the other children so most likely all of you would benefit from counseling. \n\nAlso want to let you know that inpatient can do more harm than good depending on the facility. When I was inpatient I witnessed a lot of abuse and ended up prescribed a med I should never have been on because of my heart problems but the staff didn't care and wouldn't bother to look at my relevant medical records even after a cardiac event. The entire experience ended up being very traumatic and making things worse so be aware that not all inpatient treatment facilitiesare safe let alone therapeutic. Depending on how you bring it up Kim may perceive suggestions of inpatient as a threat and you wanting to get rid of her as opposed to you trying to help. Only go that route if you fear she will seriously harm herself or others. An intensive outpatient program would be preferable to inpatient. \n\nConcerning internet access perhaps going into the phone settings and putting time limits on certain apps would be a workable solution so she can still access whatever online supports she has but not lose hours upon hours to it. I belive there are parental controls available through your ISP as well.  It may be a good idea to address the excessive amount of time spent online by framing it as a counterproductive coping mechanism that potentially damages her attention span and executive function. \n\nI definitely think talking to Kim about volunteering and getting out of the house once or twice a week would be a good choice so she doesn't keep leaning into the isolation. Getting out may also help her pick up some momentum that she can in time apply to other aspects of her mental health recovery. Being involved in something away from the family and school can be a good way for her to build up some self esteem and confidence. I know when I was living with my family and so depressed and anxious I couldn't function on even a basic level let alone regularly attend school I couldn't stand being around my family because all I could think of was how much of a disappointment and burden I was which only made me spiral further into the depression. \n\nI sincerely hope your family is able to work through this together and that Kim eventually gets to a point that her mental health is more stable allowing her to move forward.

My sister moderately struggled with mental health issues, up until junior/senior year when she started to refuse going to school and would have blow our fights with my mom over it. Following/during this time, she attempted to ended end life. Like I said, she has had previous issues but this behavior was an escalation seemingly out of no where. Following her attempt, she was hospitalized and then taken to an in-care facility for 2 weeks followed by therapy. Through this process, it came out that she had been SA\u2019d by a close friend who she would see every day at school and he would continue to harass her. During this process, we were able to get at-home-learning with a tutor/teacher that would come to our house (through our public school system but this was ~15yrs ago and our public school were/are pretty great so I\u2019m not sure if something like this would be available elsewhere). She was able to heal and get to a better place mentally all the while completing course work and getting back on track academically. Even though she was wayyyy behind, she was able to catch up and pass onto the next year.\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying Kim was SA\u2019d but how she is acting is a huge red flag and indicative of something deeper than just not wanting to go to school - not saying that you don\u2019t know that, but there is a cause to her current mental health crisis and potentially this cause is somehow related to her day to day life at school (or this cause has impacted her to the extent that she has lost her will/drive to live). \nI am by no means criticizing you - you are in an unenviable position. But forcing her to go to school in person may not be the best solution - especially if that is linked to her issues. If I were you, I would look into seeing if you can access any at home tutoring/learning (not just online but with an actual in-person educator to keep Kim more accountable).\n\nGood luck and I wish the best for you, Kim, and the rest of your family \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that I would recommend not bringing up how Kim needs to \u201cmake progress towards being a functional adult\u201d and how she has \u201c3 acceptance letters to colleges that she is very unlikely to attend now.\u201d She has enough intrinsic issues without having her parent looming those extrinsic pressures over her.

Hell, my mom even lied to me about a supposed time limit for how long insurance would be willing to cover psychiatry visits, hoping that would yield quicker results (it did not). Even as I eventually received the right diagnoses and treatments and medications (in my mid 20s, with a different doctor), my relationship with my parents remained strained until they also came around and realized that their attempts to \u201cfix\u201d the problem were, at best, just sweeping it all under the rug. \n\nI say YTA, but that\u2019s just based on this post alone. We can all be TA at times, but there\u2019s always a chance to grow. With all sincerity, my heart goes out to your whole family. This whole thing sucks for everyone involved, but really, there\u2019s still hope. My parents and I are incredibly close now. I went from college dropout to currently maintaining a 4.0 GPA in grad school. All without reducing my screen time :P", "NTA  This sounds terrible.  Your daughter is barely functional and I'm wondering if you should consider a residential program.  I am pretty sure that they would not allow her a phone or internet access so you could tell her that it would be worse if you had to send her to a program.  You might also talk to her therapist about using access to her devices as a reward system.  E.g. Get up, shower, get dressed and eat breakfast with the family - 1 hour one hour on your phone.  Complete one school assignment, 1 hour on the laptop.  Etc.  However I personally find the internet can be a support system but in most cases is not healthy and you should be sure what she's doing on her phone and laptop before allowing any access.  I know for a fact there are suicide, anorexia and self-harm supporting groups.  Supporting doing those things, not recovering from them.   It can be a dark place.", "It's not an easy situation, and I get that you are trying your best. It's hard for Kim as well, even more than you think. Have you talked with her therapist about her Internet use and your (very valid) concerns? It could be a trait, but more likely a symptom, a coping mechanism or a way to get in touch with people she relates with (that could be amazing for her, assuming these are the right groups).\n\nI can't vote on that. Honestly, you shouldn't be asking Reddit. Talk with her therapist - but also, check if there are other resources you and your family could get support from. Everyone knows having 4 kids is draining in the best situation, so I can hardly imagine how exhausting this situation might be. Best of luck to you all", "As soon as you are legally able kick her the fuck out. She's fucking using your good graces. You need to show her some tough love.", "She probably needs hospitalization in a good hospital right now, but you\u2019re punishing her for wanting to do one that distracts from her depression? YTA. Hospitalization can actually help by letting her take a break from your family, meet other teens in the same boat, and let her get away from schoolwork pressure. She\u2019ll have more frequent therapy and medication stabilization. Try Genesight genetic testing to help narrow down more effective medications for her.", "What is the reason she doesn't want to go to school?  Had anyone figured that out?  She knows.  Has anyone asked her politely and with care?  The answer is not \"she's lazy\".", "this is a really hard one.  More INFO is needed to make a proper ruling.\n\nIf your daughter has legitimate mental health issues that means she can't deal with school, then YTA.   What's more concerning is that depending on her issues, she could start self harming (or worse)\n\nBUT\n\nIf she's just lazy or obsessed with social media to the point where she's neglecting everything else, then NTA\n\nBased on what you've said, i'm leaning towards the latter so **NTA**", "NTA  Less time on the Internet is a good thing. She should do something active with her family or friends.  The fact that her \u201csupport group\u201d is online is part of the problem. You don\u2019t know if they are toxic and feeding whatever your daughter\u2019s issues are. Even if they aren\u2019t- having her friends be exclusively online is depressing on it\u2019s own because she\u2019s living through a screen never really experiencing human connection. \n\nBesides you\u2019re only limiting her online time not eliminating it. Turning it off while she should be sleeping is genius and more parents should probably do the same.  Talk to her therapist about it, but eliminating it for a week or two could be a good thing. Obviously we don\u2019t know what her issues are but I believe your instincts are correct. Also don\u2019t forget, teens are angsty no matter what.", "NTA Stand strong!

But she sounds stubborn it can take awhile.", "INFO: What does the therapist that you're seeing to support your own self care suggest?", ">Kim hates me for this and told me that restricting her internet access in this day and age is abuse.\n\nThis is what sells NTA for me. Kim needs a reality check and something has to give here. Might be you're unwilling to force her to go to school, but that's no reason to enable her to lounge around on her computer all day instead. Maybe if she gets bored enough she'll voluntarily go to school to earn back computer privileges.", "Hey there op. Therapist here. It sounds like you're trying to help your daughter but are feeling overwhelmed with balancing her needs, the needs of your other kids, and trying to navigate this situation. Which is understandable, it's not a situation you expected or planned for. \n\nI work with some teenager clients currently and this is a topic that comes up from time to time in sessions. A lot of teens use the internet to keep in contact with their friends and as a coping strategy to distract themselves from what they're dealing with. Many of them feel like when their parents restrict access they're losing access to everything that is helping them. I view the issue as being about balance. Do teens need each other for support? Absolutely. Do teens, any people in general, need distractions sometimes? Absolutely. But distraction as the only coping skill isn't helpful. Nor is being online all day. Her therapist is likely trying to help her develop other skills but it takes time to learn and implement these skills. \n\nPeople with depression tend to view things as being very black and white, all or nothing. Helping your daughter find moderation may be helpful. Also when I work with clients with depression they often stop engaging in activities that were previously helpful for them. If your daughter had activities that she previously enjoyed, like drawing or playing basketball or whatever, I would encourage you to help your daughter resume some of these activities. \n\nI also wonder if you're feeling that more support is needed if family based therapy services may be helpful. They can come into the home and work with her as an additional support and help give you and your partner some strategies to implement in the home. I personally wouldn't jump to having her removed from the home. \n\nI'm also wondering if there was some catalyst to this change like a traumatic or significant event that led to these changes?\n\nAlso, and I get that logistically this can be challenging, I often encourage clients to make meaningful time for all of their children one on one when they have a child who is struggling. Are there special things you used to do with your daughter or is there an interest she has you could try to engage in to bond with her? Can you make some time for her and your other kids?\n\nNot saying you're doing this, but a lot of times it can be hard for parents who are struggling to support their kids and deal with family changes not to get so discouraged they resent their kids. It can feel like \"why are you acting like this? Why can't things go back to how they were? What did we do wrong? Why can't you try harder?' You're dealing with your daughter's problems , but please try not to view her as a person as a problem. Remember all her strengths, all the things you love, focus on those things as you focus on helping her. \n\nViewing her mental health concerns as an illness may be helpful. If you wouldn't punish her for being diabetic, then don't punish her for being depressed. Medication takes a month to reach a therapeutic dose and actually work. It often takes longer to find the right combination of medications or dose. We follow a start low and go slow mentality, people are started on a low dose that is increased if needed to manage symptoms.\n\nPlease take care of yourself and your partner. I know this situation is hard and wish you and your family all the best. Hope your daughter starts feeling better soon.", "YTA... I am going to assume it's anxiety and depression issues.  There are so many kids that are going through that because of the changes around the pandemic.  Dealing with that and the changes of going to college. She is scared or anxiety ridden about going to her high school classes. Try to imagine thinking it's going to be 20-100 times bigger at college.  That has to be overwhelming. She probably needs to build back up to getting her life back.  Your life as an adult didn't change much with the pandemic.  Her world and it's expectations are completely different now.  How you deal with her and how you teach her to deal with these issues now is going to determine how the rest of her life will go.  Show some compassion and ask the therapist how you can help her and still discipline her in ways that work without hurting her growth.\nSet her up to succeed.  Give her small goals about going to school and doing her work.  She probably does need a schedule where she does school work at certain times but not that much time at her age.  Consider that going to therapy visits as a goal.  She needs people so going out with friends is a goal. Don't cut her off from everyone.  That's what the pandemic threatened/did. \nI am not saying she shouldn't have responsibilities.  But clearly she is having issues with those now. Keep trying things until you find what works for you both.  Remember you are the parent here.\nMaybe just take away the internet in a 2hr block at a time. Encourage her to do things that will earn her positive rewards so hopefully she will do those things in the scheduled down times.  \nIt's not easy.

Finding out why she feels depressed, what is going on in her life to make her skip school. To be honest, she might need to quit school and take a break. Personally for me, I needed to quit school and have about 6 months of just recovery in order to be able to function. After that time I studied in something I was interested in in a 6 month course, it didn\u2019t end up being what I wanted to do for the rest of my life but it was enjoyable enough that I found some happiness in life and no longer saw everything as meaningless. Before then I didn\u2019t care about anything as I didn\u2019t think I would live past 18-20 due to how bad my depression was. Finally doing something I enjoyed and where I made friends who were similar to me helped me so much. She might need a change in her life to make it better.\n\nAlso worth checking that there is no underlying conditions that may be making things difficult for her. I\u2019m 24 and I got diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 and then Autism in 2022, diagnosed so late because I\u2019m a good masker. Getting diagnosed changed my life in so many amazing ways and I\u2019ve learned how to be more patient and understanding with myself.

If she finds something she's passionate about, it could really help her.  \nTell her she's still allowed internet access on the condition that she picks an extracurricular (that requires her to get out of the house) and she works on it for at least 30mins to an hour everyday.\n\nTell your you love her and are proud of her as often as you can.  \nNAH and good luck to you.", "There are so many of us!

They didn\u2019t understand how I could be so smart and well behaved but have such problems. The idea of providing services that didn\u2019t include remedial classes was foreign to them. They really believed I was the first one and a unique case. I absolutely was not. The others just dropped out, got labeled as bad kids and were given up on, or went to alternative school. My school was majority minority and economically disadvantaged, plus it was in Texas where they were putting illegal caps on the number of SpEd students (didn\u2019t know this at the time but it was a big news story later).

It's reasonable for her father to intervene.", "That really is incorrect thinking. The hard truth that it takes a lot of work to accept is that mental health issues, including long term depression and anxiety, will never go away. There will always be that whisper in the back of your mind trying to control your emotional response.

So expecting someone to snap out of it will just lead to much worse mental health and when they finally are feeling better you might have lost that family member.", "I'm not the person you're asking but I was deeply depressed when I was her age, out of high school but still studying and also dealing with a chronic illness. what honestly helped me is that my parents never giving up on me (like truly making me do things I didn't want to but needed, like exercising), therapy and my meds. If she's been on medication and nothing seems to get better, maybe she should go back to the doctor and change meds or increase the dose. I will say that thinking about only her school is not going to be the best approach. school is very important, obviusly, but she knows it. she is probably kicking herself about it. if you keep talking and talking about she is only going to feel worse. you're doing the best you can, so NAH, but maybe change your approach a bit.", "Please stop using your profession as a way to validate your vote.

Does it cross these people\u2019s minds that the kid\u2019s doctor, or therapist, or members of an in person support group, could be predators? Probably not.

I learned my favorite hobbies only thanks to the internet.\nMy mother is quite the emotional un available person so we never had a strong relationship. I read about amazing, strong, funny people with different lives and beliefs and it broaded my mind so much. Never had many friends growing up. It was a balm and a saving grace. I grew up on the internet and it made me a better person. When I had very dark thoughts the stupid silly funny stories I could read or the shows I could fangirl about gave me a save space to be happy when all my real life world was dark and cold.\nI would not be the same person without the internet. Maybe I would not be here.\nYou can meet bad people? Sure! The same you can do in real life. Parents only think that since they can \"see\" it then you are safer. It's a comfortable lie.\nThe bullying, the bad teachers, the mean world does not end outside your phone.\nI think you would love for the internet to be the source of her problems because taking that away is easier than realising that the internet is just a coping mechanism. Like stimming is for autistic/adhd people (speaking from experience). It's a way of copying when the world is too much. It's a symptom, not the source of the problem. I know because it was mine too. Get that away and you are taking painkillers away from someone that is hurting. Keep up therapy and if you want to be sure she is not in some harmful communities try to have a nice open and light talk about what she is watching /reading on her laptop all day. PLEASE try not to make it sound judgmental. If she closes off you are never going to have her talk to you about it anymore.\nTry, I beg you, TRY to understand her enthusiasm for what she is showing you. For all you know she is learning how to code and will be a millionaire in the future. Or maybe she is looking at funny pictures of silly cartoons because it's colorful and silly and light and it makes her happy.

I highly doubt her therapist or counsellor are in support of this.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t think she\u2019s putting in the necessary work there are other solutions e.g instead of punishing her for not going into school when you KNOW that is beyond her to do consistently at the moment look at the problem of her not doing the work set at home, the bar is too high otherwise. \n\n\nAlso I notice you haven\u2019t listed why she says she isn\u2019t doing the work so I have to ask, have you even asked her? \n\nWhat your doing isn\u2019t gently pushing, it\u2019s shoving. gently pushing might include sitting with her for a bit once you\u2019ve got back from work.

Most mental health illnesses require the correct medication, plus a support network, and the right therapy. Instead of helping, by pressing the professionals for the right treatment, or finding out if the therapist or counselor is the right fit, you went to punishment. Have you tried setting attainable goals, and rewarding her meeting those goals, or have you been pointing our her perceived failures.\n\nAs someone with pretty severe mental health problems, some days a win is stepping in the shower, and I celebrate the can, instead of berating the can't.\n\nMental health is health, untreated mental illness can be terminal!", "I was like OP\u2019s daughter, and my mum tried exactly what he has too. Much like with OP\u2019s daughter, it didn\u2019t work. If I was OP I\u2019d be seriously thinking about changing tactics- maybe a new school or a new therapist or a new medication. Maybe even just getting her out of the house to an extracurricular club that she\u2019s interested in. I\u2019d back off on the school- she can always do that later, and focus on her general mental health and her relationship with her family. Work on why she doesn\u2019t want to go. \n\nMy problems with school were trauma related, and I ended up missing nearly four years of high school. In the end, I got back to school through a TAFE programme for kids who struggled in regular school and finished a year after my class did. I\u2019m now starting a bachelors degree in the field I always wanted to work in, and I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve ever been. I even worked through my last year of school. \n\nThe point is, that OP has options, as does his daughter. Most importantly he can\u2019t give up on her, because she could well have given up on herself.

She needs to understand that your obligation is to her, to parent her and help her and care for her, and that this is how you are doing those things. Tell her that restricting her access is an expression if your unconditional love for her. But she won\u2019t hear that if you yell at her. \n\nI would allow her time limited access each day. Or event limited access. Like half an hour on Snapchat or three games of whatever I don\u2019t know im not a gamer. \n\n(I have an anxious 15 year old who is addicted to her phone.

If she\u2019s no longer feeling hopeless and sad all the time, OP might want to look into other reasons why she doesn\u2019t want to or can\u2019t do things besides looking at her phone.", "Depression was my first thought. I have bipolar depression and was diagnosed very late (beyond my 20s). She may be using screens to distract herself from her depression, using external input to take her mind away from obsessing on the thoughts in her head. And before anyone says \"if she's distracting herself she's not working on her problems\" it doesn't necessarily work that way. My depression was brain chemistry related. Working on my problems never did anything to abate my depression, finding the right medication did.", "OP, forgive me if you\u2019ve already been down this road, but I think anyone who is having problems like these should be screened for ADHD and autism. Both conditions are overlooked more frequently in girls/women and both are much more nuanced than the stereotyped behaviors portrayed in pop culture. Females are also typically more prone to masking behaviors which can make ADHD and ASD harder to spot. If the screening yields suggestive results, an assessment by a QUALIFIED diagnostician should be pursued. Your daughter might be more able to go to school if she was given the accommodations that would only be available to her if she had a diagnosis. This page has some good self-administered starting points for looking into whether followup is appropriate: \n\nhttps://embrace-autism.com/autism-tests/\n\nBTW, I have a friend who is in a strikingly similar situation with her 15 year-old. When he took the online screenings, he was \u201coff the charts\u201d for autism. ASD had never occurred to her and the therapists didn\u2019t appear to be considering it, either. Now they\u2019ve got a new angle to explore. \n\nAlso, while I think your attempts might (?) not be what your kid actually needs, you\u2019re doing the best you can with a terribly difficult situation and are, therefore, NTA. I wish you the best of luck, OP!", "No, acceptance letters are always contingent on you turning in a final term performance that matches what you'd done previously.", "My sister was depressed and tried to use the internet to get support. She was then bullied to the point of su!cide, and died at 16. She was bullied by her \"online support group\". Your case is not every case. \n\n\n\nI don't think that anyone here should be vouching either way without a LOT more info, just because of how serious the stakes might be. She might be stuck in her phone to cope, or she might be having bad interactions with peers that escalate her problems.\n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to target your comment specifically, but too many people in this thread are acting like unrestricted internet access for a mentally unhealthy teenager is always good. You didn't use absolutes, but many people have. Mental health should always be treated  case-by-case, because no one's brain is the exact same.\n\n\n\nIf the daughter is depressed, she needs more help than randoms on the internet can bring. She probably needs more help than that therapist.", "Inpatient care is a horrible idea. Inpatient facilities do not really offer treatment, just \"containment and stabilization\" (quoting staff at the inpatient facility I was in). I received about 30 minutes of therapy over 10 days. These facilities are also rife with abuse. Would never recommend to anyone.", "(trigger warning for mention of ED & suicide)\n\nI had a pretty toxic online support system as a teen but it still is likely the reason I\u2019m alive today. I was suicidal, and found a sort of hope in pro-ED sites. If I could just be skinny, maybe life wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Talking to others who felt the same and pushed for me to stay alive - even in an unhealthy way - was a major game changer.\n\nSometimes unhealthy coping mechanisms are better than none. Maybe if OP\u2019s daughter had never been allowed access in the first place, it would be a different story. Removing that suddenly from her, if she\u2019s in a very vulnerable state, could be dangerous. \n\nWe don\u2019t know the actual state of OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s depression. It concerns me that no professional was consulted before removing this from her.\n\nI think OP should work with the daughters therapist to come up with a solution to the internet issue. If the therapist is saying no, allow her rest and time on devices, don\u2019t rush her back to school and homework, there\u2019s likely a good reason. If that\u2019s not the case, she likely has experience navigating this more gracefully (this is not a unique issue by any means) and is in a better position to propose change to the daughter.", "Pro ana?", "Distracting herself from her depression would be my guess.", "100%. The troubled teen industry is absolutely disgusting. \n\nI would never suggest that. Apologies if that was taken. \n\nA low needs inpatient facility normally will do a 3-6 week intake.

But the con was my mom didn't trust these people in her house alone, luckily she worked remotely and could be there, but it really paused her life for a while. \n\nI would look into it if it was an option. \n\nLook into family therapy, or see if her therapist would include you and your partner. \n\nNow what you need\n\nSmall goals for every day. She doesn't want to go to school. Okay fine. But she still needs to get up at the same time, brush teeth, go take a shower, and get new clothes on, eat breakfast, making her bed, go for a walk for 10 mins. And she has to finish all her homework for the day. If you need to see if you can have someone stay with her for the day, a relative, a friend. Just small tasks she can accomplish. \n\nSee if she was willing to go for part of the day at school. Just an afternoon after lunch. Or in the morning, she can leave if it's too much. \n\nCompassion is key, but firm accountability is important. My mom just kept saying he needs a hs degree, he can do whatever after.

I am alot more lax with him than the others (I've raised 5) I feel like I have given him the knowledge and support but I have to give him the space to spread his wings.
