Do you think they would notice? And if so, do you think they would be offended?\n\nedit* thanks for the responses so far. It\u2019s not about clutter, he has a hoarding disorder so clutter is not something he\u2019s worried about. He just genuinely has little knowledge of what\u2019s acceptable and appropriate insofar as societal norms. I\u2019m constantly coaching him on how to be more appropriate in various situations, and I start to feel like I\u2019m a nag or an asshole. Just yesterday at my family get together he asked one of my cousins where their baby\u2019s father was. He just doesn\u2019t pick up on social cues.\n\nFinal edit* I showed him your replies and he says \u201cok, point taken. Thank them for their honesty.\u201d He really does try. He just doesn\u2019t always get it, so he said \u201cask your Reddit friends.\u201d Lol my reddit friends have spoken.", "created_utc": 1671477110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq0kv9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_gift_hotel_soaps_for/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Always a need for that kinda thing.", "NTA, you are trying to save both of you from being the joke of the neighborhood.  Give them to homeless people. They really need them.", "NTA. My MIL used to do this, along with sending normal gifts, and people resented getting the hotel freebies and complained bitterly to each other behind her back. Once she gave our daughters expired coupons for a beauty treatment she\u2019d apparently gotten years earlier at a department store and that time they even griped to her. Previously they were too polite to complain about the hotel freebies. You might give them to a homeless shelter where people might actually need these items, however.", "NTA. Shelters love these, donate them there. Your partner is being a little odd on this one.", "I used to travel a lot and collect as well, but mostly for when guests were over, wife also donated a lot of them to wherever. Very tacky gift idea, no way I'd do that personally.", "NTA. Nobody wants that stuff as a \"gift.\" Donate it to a homeless/women's shelter or a school food closet instead.", "NTA While a sweet gesture for an overnight guest, it's rather strange to just gift someone shampoo and soap in tiny bottles, especially if it's a gift exchange.", "Right idea, wrong audience. \n\nGive them to those in need - gifting toiletries bags to the homeless would be the right group. He can throw in some toothpaste and toothbrushes and make some people really happy.\n\nPlease consider using paper bags if you do.

Terrible gift idea. Tacky, cheap, and thoughtless. Much better idea would be to donate to somewhere that accepts them (an old company of mine had this program set up, or maybe shelters accept them) or give them to someone who can actually benefit from them like homeless people.", "How about putting them in sets for the local homeless shelter I'm sure they will appreciate nice toiletries and the small bottles are easy to refill and keep in a rucksack", "NTA. I don't know why you have that many hotel toilettetries and maybe cthe clutter is bothering your partner, but you're right, hotel toilettetries are not really appropriate to give out as gifts and most people would not feel like there was much thought behind ssuch a gift.", "make the individual packets and donate them to a shelter.  they would appreciate them", "Tell him his heart is in the right place and take them to a shelter. They love and utilize all that kind of stuff.", "NTA.  I would think poorly of somebody who gave me that because it also shows that they may have a touch of kleptomania - taking things that don\u2019t belong to them.  Using those things is fine. Taking them is not. Or if you do take them give to homeless or use them at home. Don\u2019t hoard.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
