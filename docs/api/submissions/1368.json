But your sister is.", "NTA\n\nMy little brother used to do something similar: he would sneak small items (usually candy) onto the conveyor belt when I was checking out at grocery stores. I don\u2019t think he ever got a single thing through. He would always get pissed though when I would grab the item to set it aside since I didn\u2019t intend to buy it and would get an attitude with me about how it\u2019s only a few bucks. It is only a few bucks, but it\u2019s the lack of respect that made me not want to buy it for him as well as the deceitful way he would attempt to get the things he wanted. I told him if he\u2019d asked me the answer would have most likely been yes, but since he never asked it would always be no.\n\nAny of your friends who are saying you\u2019re the asshole, don\u2019t understand the respect dynamic in play at all. Sure it\u2019s just $5 to them, but that\u2019s a lie and a petty silent treatment to you", "NTA. You could have said, *\"I wasn't with you yesterday. I don't owe you $5, but I'm happy to loan it to you now if you want.\"* But you don't owe her money just because she might get unreasonably mad at you or ignore you for a week if you don't give in to her lies. Don't let anyone - including your sister - walk all over you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister is trying to pressure you into doing what she wants by giving you the silent treatment. Don't give into her; if she won't talk to you, find other people to hang out with. \n\nAnd furthermore, instead of lying about the $5, she could have just asked you to pay for it instead of making a demand for money that wasn't hers. You must never give into this kind of treatment, or it will never stop."]}
