No family event is.  As best as possible do that between three and eight weeks before the event. You do it to reduce uncertainty at the event, and to get it out of the way.  Mom and dad should have both known this.   \n\nNew job on the coast? Congratulations.   With the amount of travel to get back to the wedding, it may have been acceptable for you to ask mom and dad to help with your travel expenses.  The reason I say this is that you seem pretty forced to have gone to all the effort you did to get to the wedding.  Suggestion: when you show up at a wedding, you should only have positive emotions. I\u2019m glad to be included in their special event.  I come to generously offer gift of celebration.  Even if you feel obligated, leave that emotion in the rental car.  \n\nAt the wedding/reception if the personal assistant had to come to you and ask who you were, you were too far on the sidelines.   Again, with the generous emotions you could have snuck up early to give your sister a congratulations.  Or at least snuck up to the personal assistant and said hey, I\u2019m her brother Joe tell her I\u2019m really glad to be here and I wanna say hi personally when she has a moment.\n\nFinally, the reason I say, everybody sucks here :: Everybody remembers these family events and puts too much value on how people act.   For the next 20 or 40 years, everyone\u2019s going to remember you were noncooperative.   Keep this in mind for any future family event.   Be on your best behavior, even if you have to pretend.   At a minimum the cost of acting is worth the potential reward of respect given.  But hopefully, some genuine, healing and empathy, can form on both sides.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s your sisters wedding. \n\nWHY did you stay 2..5 hours away? \n\nWHY did you refuse to be in the wedding party? \n\nAbsent some sort of toxic abuse which you don\u2019t mention, your differences with your family shouldn\u2019t supersede your sisters wedding, and if that were the case why would you even be invited? \n\nYou are leaving out something significant. You sound like someone who can take a simple thing and turn it into a dramapalooza.", "Info - how far out from the wedding did you drop out? Did you rsvp that you would be coming? Why did you book accommodations 2.5 hours away and in a different state? You still had to work? You didn\u2019t have time off from when you were a groomsman? What does \u201cbegrudgingly take a picture\u201d look like?", "Sounds like the sister didn\u2019t want him there and the mother and father convinced him to come anyway and sister was pissed when he showed up sulking and didn\u2019t want to deal with it. He never said she asked him to come back, the mom did. Seems like the parents are stressed about the family discord and trying to make them both make up against their will like children and are using the wedding to do it so as not to taint the memory. Super misguided. I feel like to know if OP is the AH we need way more context about the reason for the original falling out and how OP talks to people, bc he sounds like someone who would be super rude and self centered and not realize he is making someone\u2019s wedding plans all about him.", "I agree that something is a bit off here. \n\nOP moved away and seemingly makes no effort to contact his family, but appears miffed that they don't come to visit him. He dropped out of being a groomsman and his sister was then worried that he wasn't going to attend - which he wasn't & seemingly without telling her. His father then had to convinvce OP to attend, so it sounds like OP may not have been expected by the sister. Once OP showed up, it sounds like they may have been rather prickly.\n\nIf it was obvious that OP didn't want to be there and he was no longer expected due to a lack of RSVP,  that may be the reason OP was ultimately asked to leave..... OP makes it clear he didn't want to attend the wedding, didn't want to be there and doesn't like his family.... it sounds like all of that was evident.", "I can't completely agree. I feel like the family brings out the worst in OP, which is why OP moved half a country away. My guess is, OP needs to cut all ties and live a better life.", "Their original post was titled 'aita for going no contact with my family on my sister's wedding day'. Interesting.", "I assume the unexplained \"tensions continued to rise\" line is code for \"I was an AH to the bride in the months leading up to her wedding\". So much so, she kicked him out. \n\nAnd there's plenty more that can be read between the lines... (Including the topic itself - which asks Redditors to validate his not-so-righteous indignation, rather than making a moral judgement about any of his actions.)", "I'm sorry but the sister's assistant co.ing in and telling you to leave the wedding is just WOW. He doesn't like his family and decided he won't come to the wedding. He then came because his father said to come and from the post seems like the sister was also feeling upset he won't show up. Now when he does show up, you let your assistant let him know he's not welcome and ask him to leave. \n\nYeah right. That's exactly what a sister does. Clearly OP is the one with issues. No matter what shallow reason there might be, no matter why OP dislikes his family, he is only thinking most of this in his mind. He isn't creating a scene or disrupting the event, heck he didn't even want to come. \n\nSo NTA.", "Another fantastic leap by redditors. Half of AITA is just wild speculation. If the relationship was so fraught, OP's fault or not, then you don't pressure him into coming and then send him away, even if he was sulking quietly, and there is no indication of that. OP's sister is a massive AH. OP is NTA, based on the evidence and not a huge amount of stuff I have just made up, anyway.", "Given my, fraught relationship with my mother (finally went NC 10 years too late) I could believe things happened the way OP said, or at least that OP tried their best. Family get to you emotionally in a way no one else can. I'd be inclined to say ESH with an element of NTA for not going back and accepting that the bridge was burned.", "Plus, OP left out what exactly was happening leading up to the wedding that made contentions \"continued to rise\" between sister and them.  Was it constant arguing about the mother planning the wedding? I don't think we're getting the whole story.", "So you've invented a narrative and used that to make your judgment. Great.", "Completely agree, so what if his entire family guilted him into attending? So what if his sister and mother told him to come against his wishes he should\u2019ve told them fuck you I\u2019m not coming like a proper adult instead of whining after being kicked out of a party he was convinced into going to ina state he know nobody and be happy when told to stand outside till his allowed in. \n Honestly you people astound me sometimes, he was told to leave the party, then told to come back, but wait outside till they allow him back in after convincing him to spend probably a thousand ona trip he didn\u2019t want to take and y\u2019all come in with \u201cOP sounds insufferable tbh \u201c as if any of that doesn\u2019t clue you in the kind of people OP\u2019s family is.", "Yup.  THIS 100%", "Apparently, OP was made the \"black sheep\" of his mother's family.  His sister was pissed he didn't fly across the country for the Bachelor party trip.\n\nHis cranky response is still a little over the top for just those reasons.\n\n[OP's reply to another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146jqn4/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_family_on_my_sisters/jnqw1vs/?context=3)", "OP have tension with families. We're not going into the details as of \"why\" because it's irrelevant. Thing is, they made the effort to move and attend the wedding, didn't cause any scene, was asked to leave and still leave calmly. How is that AH behavior? \n\nIt's her day so ok if sister want to kick him out for whatever reason. But then they demand him to comeback and wait outside and bury the hatched? Completely crazy entitled behavior. Made me think he have valid reason to resent his family in the first place.", "Yeah for sure there's more going on here that is clear from the post... he wants to feel like he's justified in acting the way he has but something must be festering for the sister to not talk to him all wedding then ask him to leave... that doesn't happen without something else big occuring before, big enough to split a family.  OP needs to give more info.", "He says his mother is a \"c\". Youndont have to believe him but I don't see why detailing a shitty childhood and narcissistic abuse would help him here. If we take him at his word, he's the family scapegoat. That is almost never about the child and almost always an abuse dynamic.", "The sister throwing him out makes zero sense with any information he\u2019s given.", "Because it shouldn't affect the judgement. He could've been an asshole in the past but regardless coming to a wedding he was invited to and then told to leave and then come back is really shitty. Maybe the whole family is toxic not abusive but toxic. Like as if they bring out there worst when around each other. So more than likely they are all dicks with op being more sympathetic towards.", "This should be the top comment.", "Exactly! The bride is both the host and the guest of honour... why does she even have time to notice OP is there (even if OP is a lousy guest for begrudgingly posing for a photo)", "Could be literally and figuratively. Sounds like he wasn't wanted there to begin with but family.", "Yeah, yta too because of how the story seems weird.", "the sister told him to leave", "I second this. This is weird.", "Maybe everything else is full already?", "[removed]", "Sounds like his family knew he didn\u2019t really want to attend and pestered him to attend anyway then had the nerve to kick him out for not being happy enough. I wonder why he acted aloof and hostile. OP and his mum don\u2019t sound like they have a great relationship but I bet mother wanted to put on a show for everyone else that all was fine.", "You may want to edit this reply to your initial post. It clarifies the situation some.\n\nWhen you received your invitation, did rsvp so your sister had knowledge of your attendance? Were you invited personally by your mother on your sister's behalf? It seems odd that  your sister being so surprised by you attending would have been so offended that you were unable to attend the bachelor party she would not have formally rescinded your invitation. Which would definitely make her the ass in this situation, and possibly your parents too if this is a case of them leaving important details out for both you and your sister so they could play pretend happy family in front of friends and their new inlaws.", "NTA. Look, I went through the same shit. My sister had a destination wedding and me AND my SO renewed our passports, flew across the country, then OUT of the country, and my sister didn't say ONE WORD to me for a WEEK until the last day when she literally said \"goodbye.\"\n\nAt one point the resort fucked up and booked the day after dinner as a pre wedding close family only party and we didn't find out until everyone arrived at the restaurant. They had less than half the seats they were supposed to and couldn't accommodate more. My sister was getting to the point of losing her everloving *shit* (which tends to be vicious and violent) so I told my mother me and my SO could take all of the kids and go to a different restaurant that didn't require reservations. \n\nOf course by that time my mother was... well she was aware of my sisters emotional state and was too afraid to say *anything* lest she tip her over the edge. So I made the offer right to my sister, who looked at me through narrowed eyes before announcing the new plan to the guests... all without speaking a single word to me.\n\nWe wrangled the kids for like four or five *long* hours... Kids are a lot harder than dogs, goddamn.\n\nAnyways, my family has already decided I'm the black sheep. They kinda just... paint negative attributes onto me. It's better for everyone if I don't bring attention to myself as everything I do or say seems to be (deliberately?) misinterpreted to the extent that I'll say one thing and they will *insist* I *really* meant the exact opposite.\n\nIt's better if I just keep my mouth shut, head down, and don't do anything that draws attention. It's the emotional equivalent of holding my hands up, palms out and saying \"look buddy, I don't want any problems.\"\n\nI get standing off to the side being as unobtrusive as possible. That's really all you *can* do. It's awkward af when you get pulled in for that family photo. Like, they want you to come, but they're upset that you came, and now they want to pretend for a picture that they aren't playing this fucked up push pull mind game.\n\nBut you took the fucking photo, stayed out of the way, and didn't make a scene.\n\nLook, there was always going to be a problem. They'd be upset if you didn't go, upset if you did, upset if you socialized and pretended everything was normal (\"who does he think he is?\"), upset if you didn't (\"why did he even come?\")\n\nYou can't win. \n\nBefore we went I told my SO that was the last family event I'd make myself attend. Everything else would be on my terms. \n\nShe agreed but didn't really get it until we were there. Once she saw my sister go \"days\" without acknowledging us and the fucking weird family dynamic she got it.\n\nIt's hard to explain how you're always the villan in someone else's story regardless of your actions, words, or intentions. Especially to someone who only knows you outside of the context. They just don't see in you what you family sees in you so they expect there to be some back and forth or at least some provocation on your end. They have to see it first hand to really *get* it.\n\nIt's such a weird fucking dynamic. I suggest you also give yourself permission for this to be the last event you feel obligated to attend.\n\nI'm not saying you *have* to avoid all family milestones in the future, but I do think the wedding is the last event you should feel *obligated* to attend.\n\nCheck it off your list and move on. They're likely the only ones who see you through that shit stained lense anyways.", "First off, it seems like your sister had no clue you were coming, like you're not even on speaking terms like that which is a little worrying, but it's also obvious you sulked and grumped through the entire process. How is someone that mad about taking a photo with your own mother? \n\nHonestly you need to talk to your parents and sort things out, your sister too. If you have unresolved problems a wedding is not the place to be showing up and surprising everyone. Also your mother seemed to have invited you and pressured you to stay to resolve things because she didn't want to answer questions not because she believed you should be there", " Once someone you know finds this post, we'll see what happened for sure- or at least get two sides.", "So why go to the wedding and act pouty and miserable?
