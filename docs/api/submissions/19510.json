You didn\u2019t care it was your sisters wedding, didn\u2019t care family tried to include you, and you really didn\u2019t care if your glum face was noted by the bride.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nIs this who you are as a person, or are you hurting that much of your family not coming for a visit?\n\nEveryone has busy lives, and flying out for a visit can be difficult when a wedding is being planned.  When a grown son  moves away for a career opportunity, typically at first it\u2019s the person who moved who visits home.\n\nHow long have you been gone? You are 27. Graduated when you were 23? So it\u2019s been 4 years? 1 of those years has been wedding planning. So 3 years? It\u2019s hardly enough time for you to be grousing like this.\n\nFess up. What\u2019s the deal here? Why are you so cranky?", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I can't believe people are saying you are. Your sister kicked you out of her wedding. Maybe she had reason to, as some have suggested, but you don't kick someone out and then ask them to come back and wait somewhere else while they all eat. And she wouldn't have come to find you after dinner, because that's when the party really starts and they weren't about to stop those festivities, the various little wedding things you do after eating, cutting the cake, etc.\n\nSo you would have waited an hour or two or three or who knows how long, by yourself, in your car I assume since they didn't want you coming near the venue, and you were supposed to be okay with that? You know what would have happened? You would have gone back, waited, and then she would have come out and said, \"Okay, now you can go.\"\n\nAnd this nonsense I've seen from people getting upset about you referring to your mom as a \"capital C\" is just priceless. I'll assume you know your mother better than these people do.", "NTA\n\nI assume you received an invitation and RSVPed as appropriate to that invitation.\n\nThrowing a guest out and then trying to make the guest come back is the height of WTF.", "NTA. It looks like it's best to go completely VLC or NC with your family. I am sorry that your family doesn't have any respect for you. Now that the wedding is over, you should just enjoy your trip and do something fun by yourself and go back home. Safe travels back home OP and be well.", "I hope you are accurate with what you shared here.  Going on the assumption that you were.\n\nYou are always entitled to have the feelings you feel.  No one should ever say you should feel this or do this or whatever.  It is the actions we do with our feelings that can get us into trouble.

Your sister knew how far you had come and allows you to go to the wedding but then does not want you at the reception.\n\nI completely understand why you are upset. Personally, I would be FURIOUS!  Your sister will be lucky if she ever hears from you again.\n\nTell her, you want to talk to her, so the two of you can bury the hatchet.  You will meet her in your city at Starbucks ( or a place that is okay with you) in three days.  If she does not show , then you know she does not want to bury the hatchet or every want to have a relationship with you.  You will not accept any more texts or phone calls. Full stop.\n\nGiving her a dose of her own medicine might be a wakeup call to her.\n\nSo sorry for the pain your family is causing you.\n\nHARD NTA!!!", "NTA If you were like me the family would be worried about me burying the hatchet in her skull.  Block them all not worth it.", "NTA. Your family sucks. Ignore every single person who judges you an a-h here.", "YTA.\n\nOh in so many ways... From your aloof and hostile attitude toward your family (which made your sister make the correct call in asking you to leave) to the way you speak of you \"capital C\" mother.\n\nOf course your sister asked you to leave! Do you think your hostile attitude (lowering yourself to take one picture session with mom, etc) went unnoticed? In a sea of happy and celebratory faces yours was the sullen and grumpy one. Gross! On the one day you could have risen above your own mediocrity you chose to be the same angry and grumpy you.\n\nThen the wedding was over and your family is still -- your family -- except for you they're not. When they wanted to patch things up you... Well you were on brand.\n\nYes everyone is a villain except for you. Everyone is horrible.\n\nYeah sure.", "NTA why is your sister inviting you just to uninvite you when you arrive and spend money and time on this event you were convinced to go to. then the whole back and forth with telling you to leave and others telling you to come back?!

I hate posts like this where they say their family makes \u201cno effort\u201d to come see them. OP is complaining about how expensive their plane ticket was and the 5 hour round trip drive, do they not think that would be more difficult/expensive for 5+ people? It\u2019s like they refuse to take things into perspective.", "We don\u2019t actually know she asked him to come back. We know that their mom asked him to come back. Given that she also told him to wait out of sight until after the meal and then the sister was to meet him and they would patch things up, I have doubts that the sister requested or wanted her brother back. Sounds like siblings in a bad place, and mom trying to pull puppet strings to make the family look like everything was good and avoid questions about his sudden disappearance. He was asked to leave. He did so. NTA. At least not for choosing to not go back to the reception."]}
