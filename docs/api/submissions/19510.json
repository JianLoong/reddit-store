People don't just up and move cross country and their family never attempts to contact them or visit in a vacuum. \\*Something\\* happened, no?

And why did she seem to be surprised that you attended the wedding?", "ASSUMING everything is exactly as you said, youd not be the AH.\n\nBut. BUT. The way you speak about the happenings and your family, the adjectives you choose a la \"i was diplomatic\" and \"begrudgingly took a photo\" makes me think you actually just behaved like a dick, so YTA from me.", " YTA\n\nSeldom do we receive a post hiding behind a gigantic chip on OP\u2019s shoulder, it happens occasionally, but when it does, there will be a sprinkling of NTA\u2019s and then some YTA\u2019s and some INFO\u2019s unless the OP reveals more of their bad behavior, then it\u2019s a sea of YTA\u2019s.\n\nYou seem to be very good at reminding EVERYONE that you are unhappy, no matter the event. You didn\u2019t care it was your sisters wedding, didn\u2019t care family tried to include you, and you really didn\u2019t care if your glum face was noted by the bride.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nIs this who you are as a person, or are you hurting that much of your family not coming for a visit?\n\nEveryone has busy lives, and flying out for a visit can be difficult when a wedding is being planned.  When a grown son  moves away for a career opportunity, typically at first it\u2019s the person who moved who visits home.\n\nHow long have you been gone? You are 27. Graduated when you were 23? So it\u2019s been 4 years? 1 of those years has been wedding planning. So 3 years? It\u2019s hardly enough time for you to be grousing like this.\n\nFess up. What\u2019s the deal here? Why are you so cranky?", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I can't believe people are saying you are. Your sister kicked you out of her wedding. Maybe she had reason to, as some have suggested, but you don't kick someone out and then ask them to come back and wait somewhere else while they all eat. And she wouldn't have come to find you after dinner, because that's when the party really starts and they weren't about to stop those festivities, the various little wedding things you do after eating, cutting the cake, etc.\n\nSo you would have waited an hour or two or three or who knows how long, by yourself, in your car I assume since they didn't want you coming near the venue, and you were supposed to be okay with that? You know what would have happened? You would have gone back, waited, and then she would have come out and said, \"Okay, now you can go.\"\n\nAnd this nonsense I've seen from people getting upset about you referring to your mom as a \"capital C\" is just priceless. I'll assume you know your mother better than these people do.", "NTA\n\nI assume you received an invitation and RSVPed as appropriate to that invitation.\n\nThrowing a guest out and then trying to make the guest come back is the height of WTF.", "NTA. It looks like it's best to go completely VLC or NC with your family. I am sorry that your family doesn't have any respect for you. Now that the wedding is over, you should just enjoy your trip and do something fun by yourself and go back home. Safe travels back home OP and be well.", "I hope you are accurate with what you shared here.  Going on the assumption that you were.\n\nYou are always entitled to have the feelings you feel.  No one should ever say you should feel this or do this or whatever.  It is the actions we do with our feelings that can get us into trouble. Say things we regret when we are mad. etc.\n\n>My sister\u2019s personal attendant returned and pulled me aside from my conversation. He proceeded to tell me that my sister was \u201chappy I made it; however, is overwhelmed and would prefer I leave.\u201d\n\nThis makes my blood boil.  Your sister knew how far you had come and allows you to go to the wedding but then does not want you at the reception.\n\nI completely understand why you are upset. Personally, I would be FURIOUS!  Your sister will be lucky if she ever hears from you again.\n\nTell her, you want to talk to her, so the two of you can bury the hatchet.  You will meet her in your city at Starbucks ( or a place that is okay with you) in three days.  If she does not show , then you know she does not want to bury the hatchet or every want to have a relationship with you.  You will not accept any more texts or phone calls. Full stop.\n\nGiving her a dose of her own medicine might be a wakeup call to her.\n\nSo sorry for the pain your family is causing you.\n\nHARD NTA!!!", "NTA If you were like me the family would be worried about me burying the hatchet in her skull.  Block them all not worth it.", "NTA. Your family sucks. Ignore every single person who judges you an a-h here.", "YTA.\n\nOh in so many ways... From your aloof and hostile attitude toward your family (which made your sister make the correct call in asking you to leave) to the way you speak of you \"capital C\" mother.\n\nOf course your sister asked you to leave! Do you think your hostile attitude (lowering yourself to take one picture session with mom, etc) went unnoticed? In a sea of happy and celebratory faces yours was the sullen and grumpy one. Gross! On the one day you could have risen above your own mediocrity you chose to be the same angry and grumpy you.\n\nThen the wedding was over and your family is still -- your family -- except for you they're not. When they wanted to patch things up you... Well you were on brand.\n\nYes everyone is a villain except for you. Everyone is horrible.\n\nYeah sure.", "NTA why is your sister inviting you just to uninvite you when you arrive and spend money and time on this event you were convinced to go to. then the whole back and forth with telling you to leave and others telling you to come back?! I mean come on. that isn\u2019t cool.", "NTA\n\nThey wanted you at the wedding just so they could kick you out! Your family is more messed up than mine.
