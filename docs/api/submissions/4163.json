If she's always admitted she was wrong not to be around she can hardly be surprised. As for trying to push her way into planning your wedding, it's a strange time to try to involve herself in your life.", "NTA.\n\nYeah her feelings might be hurt but this is a situation of her own creation.\n\n  \nCongrats and hope your marriage is a happy one!", "You're NTA. Parents and step-parents often  have to reap what they have sown.", "NTA\n\nYou were honest and this is what you experienced! Kids want their parents to be there and to support them, Claire did and your mother didn\u2019t sadly. It sad but it\u2019s true.", "It's hard to say- But I think NTA. If it's true it's true, you asked the more prominent mother figure in your life to help you plan your wedding. I know divorce and custody splits can be hard on people, but if you refuse to be around your son when he's with someone you dislike, you're going to make a gap- She chose to avoid these people over potentially spending extra time with her son and supporting you.  \n\n\nMAYBE it was harshly said or something, but NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe person who was there during your baddest of times, is the one you'd rather have as a parent. Claire was that parent to you. \n\nYour mother was happy to ignore you if your dad was there. I'm not sure if Claire was trying to be a mother figure to you instead of trying to replace your mother, but she's certainly done well in the former.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know the context in which you told your birth mother that the SM was always their for you. Sounds like maybe you think you were a bit harsh? \n\nIf your BM has tried to make amends for being absent, then perhaps you could have used a bit more tact when telling her how you felt. \n\nIf your delivery sucked, then you probably need to have a talk with your Mom and try to smooth things over. This is only if you truly want her there\u2026but also let her know that Claire will be there too, because while she can never take your BM place, she also is an important part of your life. \n\nIt\u2019s natural for a mom to want to be involved in her sons wedding, but she definitely doesn\u2019t need to manipulate you in order to make that happen. Your SM has been in your life for a long time, she really should be over it by now. If your BM really has been honest with herself about her role, then she will come to terms with the way things are.", "YTA.\n\nThe example with you being drunk at 16 as why Claire is better than your mum isn't a good one. It is easier to be the cool older figure I'm those situations when it isn't your flesh and blood.\n\nDocking your mum points for not wanting to be around your dad is also unfair. Do you know why they split up and what memories it would bring back.\n\nWhat you said was needlessly spiteful and immature. Unfortunately people this day and age are content with handling sensitive issues without tact so you'll probably get a lot of NTAs with a \"who does your mum think she is\" thrown in for good measures.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Time to get over it .", "Actually it is.  When teenagers decide to do stupid things like get drunk, they need a safe adult they can call in order to not confound the issue.  It's not like Claire got him drunk.", "My point about that was Claire never made me feel stupid or less than, she\u2019s always been fully supportive", "I understand what you are saying. A long time ago I was 21 and felt the same way towards relatives who were supportive without being critical. \n\nAs you get older, you realise that balance is important. For instance, at 16 you did need a voice telling you that getting plastered and staying out after midnight, not knowing how you will get home, is stupid.\n\nDifferent people play different roles in your lives. As your, she may have to deal with the ugly things that you won't appreciate until you have children of your own.", "NTA. Claire didn\u2019t \u201csteal both her men\u201d - apparently she let her have them because she just wasn\u2019t as involved in your lives. I hate to say it, but the fact that your mother is now refusing to attend the wedding over this shows why you have a better relationship with Claire - your mother expects you to do all the heavy lifting in your relationship, expecting you to do all the work while she does nothing.", "NTA. I find it hilarious her solution to not being considered more of a parent because she wasn't around much is... Missing another big event. \n\nTell her glad you can give her an excuse. There's no arguing with people who don't understand they're the problem.", "YTA - This wasn't your fight to begin with. Your fiancee can consult with whoever she wants about wedding plans. So yes, your birth mother is wrong to demand a part in that process. But that isn't your fight, its you fiancee's. Its her place to give bio-mom the reason for not consulting her, if she wants to. \n\n\"Fiancee trusts Claire\" is all the explanation that you would need to give. (Not really an explanation, but rather a re-statement of known facts.)", "He is right. His mother didn't mother him, she was not present. And he accepted Claire in his life.", "NTA but there are some questions I have that could flip that choice. What was the living situation for Claire? Was she a SAHP or did she work? What was your mom\u2019s situation? Was she single and having to work full time? I mean it\u2019s not fair to say mom wasn\u2019t around if she was alone and trying to make it financially while Claire got to be a SAHP. So honesty there are some facts left out that I think are relevant but based on info given NTA.", "NTA your mom sounds jealous and bitter \ud83d\ude12\n\nDoes she think she can have her baby boy back after multiple years of not being present in your life like come on \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. It's your wedding.", "NTA - You were honest with her  and by her own admission she knows that she was an absent mother. And honestly she's just continuing to be an absent mother by not going to your wedding, so she isn't making her case any better. Also Claire didn't take both her men, one was already gone and the other she pushed away by being absent.", "NTA \n\nIf your mom chose not to be around, then this is a situation of her own doing. The person who acted like your mom gets more involvement regardless of who gave birth to you.", "NTA\n\nShe has shown over and over again how you are prioritized in her life.\n\nMove on, enjoy your wedding.", "NTA and my mother was disinherited in my grandmother's will for going to visit her stepmother and her siblings when I was 18. While mom was out of town, grandma had her lawyer redraw the will and add a clause stating she \"specifically leaves nothing to\" her daughter. My grandmother was always jealous that my mom called ANYONE ELSE a maternal title. She was too busy being abusive to choose to be at minimum civil or magnanimous.", "NTA\n\nAnd has obviously not learnt to be more present.\n\nApologies are meaningless if there is no change", "NTA for being honest about your feelings.

OP had that voice--*in his own head.* A kid who makes a call for help to his parents at 1 a.m. has already realized he fucked up. It's the kid who *doesn't* call who needs a lecture.\n\nMy mother took the \"If you realize you're in a bad situation, call me and give the code word and I will come get you with no questions asked afterwards\" parenting tack with me. I only ever used it once or twice (when people around me were drinking/doing things that frightened me that I didn't want to be dragged into). Every friend I've had with \"strict lecture\" parents got into far worse situations at the same age because they were more afraid if their parents than the consequences of muddling through on their own. My son is a tween and I've already given him the same \"no questions asked\" offer my mother gave me, because the parents who don't take that approach are raising better liars, not better thinkers.\n\nThere's a big difference between being non-judgmental when a kid realizes a mistake on their own and being enabling when a kid thinks they're doing just fine. It sounds like you got the latter, but that's not what OP described.", "This is a tough call based on the information you provided.  Good for Claire for going to your school activities, but why was it that your mom wasn't there?  Is it because she didn't want to be there, or is it that she DID want to be there, but couldn't take time off from work?  Claire picked you up when you were drunk.  That's not a great example of how Claire was better than your mom.  Why did Claire pick you up instead of your dad?  Why aren't you making this comparison?  You understand that parents have to behave differently than other adult figures in your life. You didn't give great examples of your mom not being there for you, so I can't say that you're N T A.  Maybe your mom was in fact terrible, I don't know based on what you've said.  But I can't help but think that you're punishing your mom for your parents failed marriage.", "Your approach is going to be a hard no from me. Relying on good old fashioned anecdotal evidence, I have friends who are 6ft under and some who are strung out on drugs because they had parents who didn't raise then with a firm enough hand.\n\nI'm not calling on parents to be uncompromising hard asses. You're right in pointing out that it is detrimental. Kids should not fear consequences more than the risk of making the situation worse.\n\nWhat I am flagging is that it is wrong to measure how his step mum makes him feel against how his mum makes him feel without considering their roles in his life. The fact of the matter is when someone is your child, you have to take on some of the more ugly aspects of raising a child. One of those aspects is letting them know of your disapproval, and punishing them need be, when their actions endanger themselves.", "Relying on both good old fashioned anecdotal evidence and developmental science, if you treat your kids the same regardless of whether they hide the shit they get up to or come clean on their own, your kids will not get into fewer dangerous situations. They will, however, get very practiced at lying to you, and be more likely to end up \"6ft under\" when they do something stupid and don't reach out for help. Kids do not fully grasp \"you might fucking die without intervention in this situation,\" but they DO fully grasp \"your parents will impose consequences if they find out\" -- so guess which outcome their brain will naturally give more weight?\n\nYou're drawing a line between parenting and step-parenting that simply isn't in evidence. What Claire did was parenting, the exact same thing my \"flesh and blood\" mother would have done for me in that situation. There's no indication whatsoever that Claire never gave OP discipline, only that when OP had an emergency, Claire was trustworthy and responsive and OP's mother was not. I regularly cite my mother's \"no questions\" policy when explaining why she's a great mother, too, and she had exactly zero qualms about meting out discipline or consequences in non-emergency situations."]}
