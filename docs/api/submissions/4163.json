If she's always admitted she was wrong not to be around she can hardly be surprised. As for trying to push her way into planning your wedding, it's a strange time to try to involve herself in your life.", "NTA.\n\nYeah her feelings might be hurt but this is a situation of her own creation.\n\n  \nCongrats and hope your marriage is a happy one!", "You're NTA. Parents and step-parents often  have to reap what they have sown.", "NTA\n\nYou were honest and this is what you experienced! Kids want their parents to be there and to support them, Claire did and your mother didn\u2019t sadly. It sad but it\u2019s true.", "It's hard to say- But I think NTA. If it's true it's true, you asked the more prominent mother figure in your life to help you plan your wedding. I know divorce and custody splits can be hard on people, but if you refuse to be around your son when he's with someone you dislike, you're going to make a gap- She chose to avoid these people over potentially spending extra time with her son and supporting you.  \n\n\nMAYBE it was harshly said or something, but NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe person who was there during your baddest of times, is the one you'd rather have as a parent. Claire was that parent to you. \n\nYour mother was happy to ignore you if your dad was there. I'm not sure if Claire was trying to be a mother figure to you instead of trying to replace your mother, but she's certainly done well in the former.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know the context in which you told your birth mother that the SM was always their for you. Sounds like maybe you think you were a bit harsh? \n\nIf your BM has tried to make amends for being absent, then perhaps you could have used a bit more tact when telling her how you felt. \n\nIf your delivery sucked, then you probably need to have a talk with your Mom and try to smooth things over. This is only if you truly want her there\u2026but also let her know that Claire will be there too, because while she can never take your BM place, she also is an important part of your life. \n\nIt\u2019s natural for a mom to want to be involved in her sons wedding, but she definitely doesn\u2019t need to manipulate you in order to make that happen. Your SM has been in your life for a long time, she really should be over it by now. If your BM really has been honest with herself about her role, then she will come to terms with the way things are.", "YTA.\n\nThe example with you being drunk at 16 as why Claire is better than your mum isn't a good one. It is easier to be the cool older figure I'm those situations when it isn't your flesh and blood.\n\nDocking your mum points for not wanting to be around your dad is also unfair. Do you know why they split up and what memories it would bring back.\n\nWhat you said was needlessly spiteful and immature. Unfortunately people this day and age are content with handling sensitive issues without tact so you'll probably get a lot of NTAs with a \"who does your mum think she is\" thrown in for good measures.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Time to get over it .", "Actually it is.  When teenagers decide to do stupid things like get drunk, they need a safe adult they can call in order to not confound the issue.  It's not like Claire got him drunk.", "My point about that was Claire never made me feel stupid or less than, she\u2019s always been fully supportive", "I understand what you are saying. A long time ago I was 21 and felt the same way towards relatives who were supportive without being critical. \n\nAs you get older, you realise that balance is important. For instance, at 16 you did need a voice telling you that getting plastered and staying out after midnight, not knowing how you will get home, is stupid.\n\nDifferent people play different roles in your lives. As your, she may have to deal with the ugly things that you won't appreciate until you have children of your own.", "NTA. Claire didn\u2019t \u201csteal both her men\u201d - apparently she let her have them because she just wasn\u2019t as involved in your lives. I hate to say it, but the fact that your mother is now refusing to attend the wedding over this shows why you have a better relationship with Claire - your mother expects you to do all the heavy lifting in your relationship, expecting you to do all the work while she does nothing.", "NTA. I find it hilarious her solution to not being considered more of a parent because she wasn't around much is... Missing another big event. \n\nTell her glad you can give her an excuse. There's no arguing with people who don't understand they're the problem.", "YTA - This wasn't your fight to begin with. Your fiancee can consult with whoever she wants about wedding plans. So yes, your birth mother is wrong to demand a part in that process. But that isn't your fight, its you fiancee's. Its her place to give bio-mom the reason for not consulting her, if she wants to. \n\n\"Fiancee trusts Claire\" is all the explanation that you would need to give. (Not really an explanation, but rather a re-statement of known facts.)", "He is right. His mother didn't mother him, she was not present. And he accepted Claire in his life."]}
