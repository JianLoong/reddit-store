He was *telling*\\--even after you made it clear that you don'\\[t want outsiders staying over.\n\nIf the mother hasn't arrived yet, you must now tell him she is forbidden to come in even for a moment--because once she's in, she's staying. Tell him you'll call the cops if she comes.\n\nYes, it will destroy the relationship with him, but it is already destroyed in his bringing into your daily life a stranger from a family that makes you uneasy.\n\nYou have no future with this BF. You can't be uneasy in your own home.", "NTA. Your boyfriend\u2019s  demands that you are gonna do this that and the other for his mother are over the top controlling. Those demands would not sit right with me either.", "Run away from this man. Far away.

Run fast.", "You are being bullied into a very uncomfortable and untenable situation. Your partner agreed to your conditions and now is backtracking big time.

Do not allow his mother into your home that \u201ccouple of days\u201d will turn into the entire week and he will NOT take off work.

His family already doesnt like or respect you and letting her stay isnt going to change that, all its going to do is show they can push you around.", "NTA\n\nThis man is just a pile of red flags. Anyone who allows their family to mistreat their partner is automatically an AH. His silence makes him complicit in their abuse of you. Not only should this man's mother never be allowed in your home, I strongly suggest he shouldn't be either. You deserve better than being treated like a maid by a man like this.", "NTA, this is your safe space. You told him what you needed and he completely ignored you. Kick him and his toxic family to the curb. You need to stand up for yourself, because he certainly won't.", "NTA. You are allowed to have boundaries. You are allowed to have feelings of uncertainty and anxiety, and you are allowed to try to be comfortable.\n\nMy humble opinion is that he needs to respect the person he's with, needs to respect boundaries, needs to understand that people have no obligation to satisfy his demands.\n\nThat's not the kind of person I'd want to change my behavior for. Much less the kind of person I'd want to \"earn\" the \"respect\" of.\n\nYeah, something isn't sitting right. The balance of the relationship isn't sitting right. What has he done for you? What has he given up to accommodate your needs? Without any further info it kinda looks like this relationship is kind of a one-way street. I could be wrong though, and I hope I am. Relationships often require compromise from both or all involved - but they can't be *all* compromise because the more pieces of you that you give up, the less of you there is left to give. I hope that in the broader picture he makes up for the things he asks of you. But ngl the way you've put it, it doesn't seem like he does."]}
