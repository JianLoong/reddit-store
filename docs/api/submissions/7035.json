I have invisible disabilities, too. \n\n\n\nI live in an apartment that has some yard space. My ESA came home last March. Since I brought him home he has been going potty in the back yard or in the park. The park is now inaccessible because snow, so we've gone back to going potty in the back yard. Now for the most part we stick to one side, but every so often my dog likes to go explore the other side. \n\n\n\nI have a neighbor, let's call her K, that has apparently decided that my dog going potty where her kids play is the worst thing in the world. Both times she has come out specifically to \"talk\" to me, my dog has been off sniffing something, both of us minding our own business. The second time she came out it triggered a panic attack. Her reasoning is my dog shouldn't be peeing where kids play & she claims the property manager told her I can't have my dog in her kids \"play space\". My dog hasn't peed where her kids play - it's been on the tree, the lamp post, or on the other side of the yard where only we have been - and I clean up all his poo. \n\n\n\nThere are no designated play spaces at my apartment besides a playground, which is never used, and the yard is open to anyone to use. Because it's no pet housing, there's also no designated dog use areas. I am waiting to hear back from the property manager if there are any actual restrictions, but was not told of any when I finalized my accomodation.\n\n\n\nThe streets have chemicals and salt on them because winter. My dog's feet get tore up easily and he'd rather chew his own foot off than wear booties. This yard space is about the only accessible space we have to access safely. \n\n\n\nSo AITA? Also I apologize if the formatting is wonky, I'm mobile.\n\n\n\nETA: I would very much love to move but despite what y'all think, it's not that simple. I have every right to live here with accomodations as does a person with a wheelchair, etc. \n\n\n\nYes, it's true ESAs aren't protected under ADA but they are protected under the Fair Housing Act. I have gone through the proper measures to acquire my accomodations for housing and my property manager is well aware I have my dog, so no, I won't lose my dog or be evicted. \n\n\n\nI am doing my best to avoid K and her kids and use different spaces. K did not have a problem with my dog using this particular space until a week or so ago. I really haven't interacted with her or her kids in months until this.", "created_utc": 1673396139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108pvk3/aita_for_letting_my_dog_go_in_spaces_kids_play/", "score": 528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
