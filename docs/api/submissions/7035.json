I have invisible disabilities, too. \n\n\n\nI live in an apartment that has some yard space. My ESA came home last March. Since I brought him home he has been going potty in the back yard or in the park. The park is now inaccessible because snow, so we've gone back to going potty in the back yard. Now for the most part we stick to one side, but every so often my dog likes to go explore the other side. \n\n\n\nI have a neighbor, let's call her K, that has apparently decided that my dog going potty where her kids play is the worst thing in the world. Both times she has come out specifically to \"talk\" to me, my dog has been off sniffing something, both of us minding our own business. The second time she came out it triggered a panic attack. Her reasoning is my dog shouldn't be peeing where kids play & she claims the property manager told her I can't have my dog in her kids \"play space\". My dog hasn't peed where her kids play - it's been on the tree, the lamp post, or on the other side of the yard where only we have been - and I clean up all his poo. \n\n\n\nThere are no designated play spaces at my apartment besides a playground, which is never used, and the yard is open to anyone to use. Because it's no pet housing, there's also no designated dog use areas. I am waiting to hear back from the property manager if there are any actual restrictions, but was not told of any when I finalized my accomodation.\n\n\n\nThe streets have chemicals and salt on them because winter. My dog's feet get tore up easily and he'd rather chew his own foot off than wear booties. This yard space is about the only accessible space we have to access safely. \n\n\n\nSo AITA? Also I apologize if the formatting is wonky, I'm mobile.\n\n\n\nETA: I would very much love to move but despite what y'all think, it's not that simple. I have every right to live here with accomodations as does a person with a wheelchair, etc. \n\n\n\nYes, it's true ESAs aren't protected under ADA but they are protected under the Fair Housing Act. I have gone through the proper measures to acquire my accomodations for housing and my property manager is well aware I have my dog, so no, I won't lose my dog or be evicted. \n\n\n\nI am doing my best to avoid K and her kids and use different spaces. K did not have a problem with my dog using this particular space until a week or so ago. I really haven't interacted with her or her kids in months until this.", "created_utc": 1673396139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108pvk3/aita_for_letting_my_dog_go_in_spaces_kids_play/", "score": 347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bc then dogs that are not working are still \u201cdoing\u201d something for their owner, like giving companionship. So they\u2019re also slaves. Their \u201cjob\u201d is just different.

And if someone has dog trauma, again it is on them and not anyone else to try and control their issues. If someone is afraid of cars, cars don\u2019t go away, if someone is afraid of birds, they don\u2019t just disappear and it goes for every other fear/trauma related issue one may have. There is a reason ESAs are protected federally and it isn\u2019t because people wanted a law so they can break building rules, it\u2019s because regardless of someone\u2019s disability/illness and the support needed to manage that should not ever prevent someone from being able to access affordable and secure housing, regardless of the reason.", "Oh yes, not petting the dog is what set her off", "You're 100 correct. If random people are petting a service animal, someone just bought a vest and card off the internet. My ex bf did this. Dog ended up biting 3 waitresses.

I have severe social anxiety, but people tend to be far more friendly if you have a well behaved dog with you, which makes it easier for me to approach them. When people ask to pet her I get a little human interaction too. Without her I get so anxious that I shy away from everyone. My ESA interacting with people allows me to feel safe enough to do the same.\n\nYour reaction is exactly why I hate people who stick a vest on a pet. So many people do it that real ESAs get tagged with the same brush. The biggest tell I've found is behaviour. If the dog is constantly at the end of its leash, barks a lot, or jumps up, then you probably have a fake ESA. A dog that stays calm and close to its owner is more likely to be the real thing. My girl will roll over for almost anyone, please don't assume that means she's not an ESA.", "Yes, it is done all the time.

There are many online services for this and anyone could get their dog a prescription to be an esa. Do dogs help with people\u2019s anxiety? Sure. But that\u2019s everyone. They need to make serious reforms to have legitimate ESAs. ESAs need regulations as most people are just abusing the system for housing/hotels. The majority of ESAs I see as a veterinarian are terribly trained unlike service dogs.", "And also to your point, yes they have FHA protections but not ADA protections like someone in a wheelchair, so your comparison is poor.", "I understand the difference. I am a medical professional who has prescribed ESAs (and more frequently declines to prescribe them) and I have one myself. I also have a very close relationship with someone personally who has a service animal and have witnessed the discrimination they face in large part because of the over-utilization of ESAs. You don\u2019t get to change the laws to your liking. Is it abused? Absolutely.

For me, it's a cat. Trained Service animals are always exclusively dogs. \n\nESAs are not protected outside of the Fair Housing Act. Restaurants and businesses, and yes, even flights(at least not outside of the cargo area) do not legally have to accept ESAs. ESAs are not and never will be protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act. They do have to protect Service animals. ESAs are not trained, they shouldn't have to be. They are there for emotional support/comfort to relieve moderate anxiety and depression. Services dogs are, generally, trained to provide a service, such watching for signs of an impending seizure or full on panic attacks brought about by PTSD, to name but a couple. That said, if the ESA is a dog, basic training should be required(which is what you mean). They should know to sit, lie down, heel, and be fully crate, leash/harness, and potty trained. They should also be trained to be around other ESAs and service dogs, as well as people, children included.\n\nService dogs should always come with paperwork detailing skill trained to perform and why the dog is medically necessary and I feel that any place should be allowed to ask for proof of the dog being an actual service dog and not just an ESA. ESAs should only be allowed where the owner will be residing, whether temporary(as in a hotel stay), or more permanently, as they are not protected outside of this area, anyway. Proof of immunizations should also be made available upon request for all animals in either case.", "So what about the people in the neighboorhood that walk their dogs around apartment complexs that don't live there?

I feel like you are very out of touch with the reality of life which is even in a \"pet-free\" apartment, dogs will be around (mostly happens because land lords don't want to pay for any damages animals cause btw not to pamper a select few who don't like animals). Sorry to burst your bubble but people with dogs exist and if people don't want to be around any at all that severely I highly recommend they move far away from other people. If its not direct harming or affecting them (they can avoid the area for the 5 minutes it takes a dog to do their business!), they can move on with their life and avoid it. It's not like OPs dog attacked them, is aggressive or doing its business in the direct playground.

People come up to me and ask to pet her, which means I can socially interact with people rather than trying to scurry from place to place avoiding absolutely everyone.
