My daughter (16) has a thing for baking, she bakes cakes and some (I said some not all!) sweets and makes money out of it by selling her work to relatives, friends and supposedly us!\n\n\nMy husband's (Her stepdad) 45th birthday took place days ago. He asked my daughter to bake him the birthday cake and she agreed. I told him about paying her to which he responded with \"pfff pay her? Get outta here, I'm her dad!\". I insisted seeing she's \"a yes\" person and a people's pleaser so won't outright demand the money from him. He said he'd pay but days went by and he didn't pay her a cent.\n\n\n I decided to go ahead and sell the wrist watch I bought him as his birthday cake and pay her for her. He foubd out and went off on me. I told him he had rnough time and shouldve paid her seven before he recieved the cake. He said that I was teaching her to treat familial relationship as \"transactional\" and raiding her to be \"materialistic\". I explained the time, effort and even money she put towards making the cake but he lashed out verbally calling me an asshlle for making this move and for enabling my daughter to expect so much from family that she's supposed to help with nothing in return.\n\n\nHe's furious and told almost the whole family about how I took back his birthday gift and returned it. I got enough shame from family members to begin to think that I might be an asshole for how I dealt with this.\n\n\nAITA? Ya'll, my daughter did want and expect to be paid. If she intended for it to be for free then I would have kept my mouth shut. And also the wristwatch idn't expensive. I kept the rest of the money after giving my daughter her share.", "created_utc": 1667326487, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjgdh9/aita_for_returning_my_husbands_birthday_gift_to/", "score": 9577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you are trying to support her to learn how to cope in a less dysfunctional manner, you could have used this as a teaching opportunity to encourage her to advocate for herself, to speak up for her needs, to assert herself. In addition to enabling her, you created a situation of triangulation & scapegoated your husband. You\u2019re not an asshole, you\u2019re human, but he\u2019s definitely not an asshole & it\u2019s no wonder why he\u2019s upset.

Then *before the cake was even given to him* OP sold his gift to pay her daughter. How cheap and greedy is OP? If OP really wanted her daughter to be paid for the cake she'd already agreed to make OP's husband, OP could have paid her herself?\n\nYTA. Damn.", "Don\u2019t forget the red wine jus \ud83d\ude0a", "Yeah, a cake is pretty much the norm. A lot of time people ask for a homemade cake from people they care about. It's more personal then a store bought one. The fact the dad asked the daughter for one would make one makes it seem like he cares for her.\n\nThen OP stepped in...", "Me either. If she uses special stuff beyond what a typical homemade cake would require (like fondant or other extra stuff like that), I could understand wanting to cover her supplies, but OP doesn\u2019t clarify details like that either (unless in comments I have not seen).\n\nEven IF she has special supplies she buys and uses, even IF she wouldn\u2019t want to gift her stepdad and wants to treat him like a regular customer, I still think OP should have paid for her husband\u2019s birthday cake anyways.\n\nThe whole thing is strange to me.", "I agree. I don't think OP legitly asked her for her daughter's opinion about getting paid or not.", "And the saut\u00e9ed onion flowerettes."]}
