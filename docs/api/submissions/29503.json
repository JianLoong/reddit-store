I was standing waiting for an event to start (friend went to grab snacks) when I felt something brush against my arm. I didn't think much of it because like I said, this park gets busy and sometimes that can happen. A few moments later, I felt another brush against my arm. I glance back real quick and I see a teen (16?) in a wheelchair. Shortly after, I feel a hand grab onto my arm. I pull away and try to move a little further. The teen grabs my arm again and starts patting me. I say \"No\" and pull away to leave. As I start walking away I hear the mom (assuming) yelling out that her kid is special needs and is being loving and doesn't hurt anyone. Pretty sure she called me ableist but at that point I had already walked off. \n\nAITA? I don't like being grabbed, I don't want any physical contact with someone I don't know.

That said \"No\" and then removing yourself from the situation is a complete sentence and should have been respected, or the mom should have intervened at that time. \n\nThere is nothing ableist about not wanting to be touched without consent and saying no to touch without consent and removing yourself from a situation. \n\nI worked with special needs teens and adults when I spent a number of years volunteering for a major Special Olympics competition.  We were absolutely told that it was okay to say \"No\" to unwanted touch and that the athletes were taught to respect that.

You have the right to decide who touches your body; full stop. Where the disability comes in is how we judge the teen for touching you in a way that would ordinarily be inappropriate: they don\u2019t know any better so we don\u2019t impose formal liability or social ostracism on them, as we would for a non-disabled person doing the touching. But nothing about the disability changes the fact that you can react verbally and remove the unwanted touching from your body.\n\nThe mom needed to have been more conscious of what was going on. If she had happened to miss this, but generally was on top of it and was apologetic, N A H. But her reaction makes her the asshole here.", "NTA. You don't have to give up your personal space or autonomy because a kid wants to touch you. You don't owe any part of your body to anyone. Mom needs to teach her kid to ask PERMISSION to touch other people.", "NTA because you shouldn't be touched if you don't like it but nuance would factor into it. Would it have been nicer if you smiled at them and said no thank you before walking off? Sure. But if you simply said no and removed yourself from the situation that's totally fine. If you had scolded or yelled at them or given a nasty look or something then yeah that's a little mean and you'd probably be the asshole.", "NTA   Next time, scream \"SEX PERVERT\", and don't stop.", "The fact you're questioning yourself I'd say you're not an AH, but you definitely could/should have handled it differently. Now you know for next time. Everything in life is a learning experience.", "NAH you can choose to remove yourself but also when non speaking people try to reach out for social interaction it\u2019s nice when people don\u2019t shut that down because it\u2019s not typical", "I'm going to go against the general consensus here and say YTA, but in as gentle a way as possible. When someone has special needs, it is an AH move to make them and their family feel as though they are being a nuisance/making you uncomfortable. To be clear, it was completely fine and appropriate of you to pull away and put personal space between you and the teen, but you were a jerk to say \"no.\" That is what you say to a dog who jumps up on you, not a child who is trying to interact with you but doesn't understand how to. That mom reacted badly because parents of mentally disabled children agonize over the way people treat their kids, and they constantly have to apologize just for having  their own kids out in public. She probably felt sick to her stomach when she saw your interaction with her kid. It wouldn't surprise me if she dwelled on it the rest of the day. I know it was a small moment in time for you, but it really would have made a huge difference in that family's life if you had just smiled politely and moved your arm without saying anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A big part of that is not allowing someone like within reach of strangers, or standing within arms reach to gently intercept their hands when they do try to touch.

This kind of behavior not being stopped and/or being endorsed is the reason there\u2019s alot of SA from disabled children and/or adults**, of course not all are and I\u2019m not implying that all do.

He\u2019s actually gotten violent about it before. The difference is they actually attempt to stop it, they keep reinforcing that it\u2019s wrong so he learns not to. They also keep him supervised at all times. That way they\u2019re aware if anything happens that shouldn\u2019t be, so he can be stopped. **For the record ableism is discrimination, she\u2019s not mad he was discriminated against, she\u2019s mad he didn\u2019t get preferential treatment and access to your body**. Plenty of people don\u2019t like to be touched by ANYONE. That doesn\u2019t make you rude or ableist. \n\nBtw her labeling his touching you as \u201cloving\u201d is gross, especially when he doesn\u2019t know you.

It\u2019s assault regardless of intent**. That phrasing is manipulating and disgusting. You did absolutely nothing wrong and shouldn\u2019t feel the slightest bit guilty. If anything that mother should be ashamed of herself for attempting to make you feel guilty for having basic bodily autonomy. \n\nThis is what happens when parents don\u2019t want to parent, and want to make the lack of parenting the public\u2019s issue. Like when kids run around a restraint with waiting carrying food and drinks, or when kids try to take bites out of things in the store then put them back. **I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not hard and that raising a special needs child isn\u2019t difficult, but that doesn\u2019t negate her responsibility to teach her child right from wrong and stop him when he\u2019s doing something he shouldn\u2019t be doing**. Don\u2019t let her words take up anymore square footage in your mind. The fact that you\u2019re questioning public wether you should\u2019ve just allowed yourself to be touched against your wishes speaks volumes to how well her manipulation worked on you. **Let it go babe.

At all. \nAs a parent to a special needs child, the mothers behavior is insane. Just because a person is special needs does not entitle them to do whatever they want, whenever they want. Reaching out and touching a stranger without permission is NEVER ok. \nMy child is very very loving, and at 4 we actively work on teaching you do not touch someone you don't know and you don't touch someone who asks not to be touched. \nI wouldn't want to be touched by a stranger either, I don't blame you at all. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.

However, at 16, he is used to people being mean to him. It bothers his mother more than it bothers him. My brother is mentally challenged so I speak from experience.", "NTA but it would have been the kind thing to say \u2018sorry, I don\u2019t like to be touched\u2019 while moving away or something that shows compassion for someone different who processes differently. I am not saying you did anything wrong, but so many of these AITA are instances where someone isn\u2019t \u2018wrong\u2019 but they aren\u2019t kind or flexible or even remotely interested in seeing other perspectives. It\u2019s exhausting.", "I was helping out a special needs student a few weeks ago in class. He put his hands on me in an affectionate, yet inappropriate way. I told him no and continued to help him with his math problem. All of a sudden, he grabbed my arm and dug in his nails really hard. He broke skin through two layers of clothes and left a bruise. Don't ever let someone shame you for refusing and distancing yourself from unwanted contact, disability or not. These aren't little kids; they can be quite strong.", "NTA!!!!

You could have handled it more gently but you arent reqired to. I have had a special needs kid run up and pull my plait. The parents apologised and were handling it so well. Luckily, i didnt mind and when he managed to escape and come back, we held both hands and swayed together as redirection. I didnt have to do that, I could have just said no and gently pushed him away.   \nHer reaction was also over the top. You didnt turn and say 'why are you touching me? abuse! help!'

This is a two way street. By teaching her child that it's OK for him to touch people without consent, she may be normalizing it to him for other people to touch him without consent.\n\nDave Hinsburger talked about this a lot; that teaching people with intellectual disabilities boundaries is teaching them how to protect themselves from others invading their boundaries as much as it is teaching them not to break others boundaries.", "NTA special needs or not, boundaries must be set.

They may lack the ability to understand consent, but their body wants sex. Many who can learn to understand are not taught because parents or caregivers see them acting as a younger child would and treat them as such.

That\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault, and it\u2019s certainly not yours.

It is hard as a parent to make sure that our kids can be safe in the world, but part of this means keeping others safe as well! I try to keep a distance from others in public just in case, and it's also not hard as a parent to push a wheelchair and be on guard to say 'Hands to self' and intervene before a stranger is touched. \nI'm sorry this Mom tried to make you feel ableist. I hope that Mom goes home and really thinks about this interaction.", "Omg. This just awakened some repressed memory \n\n I kicked a homeless woman like that as a teen and I felt SO BAD. I was walking past her (sitting on the ground) and I was listening to music. I assume she was trying to get my attention but I kept walking so she decided to... try and grab at my ankle? I only saw her out of the corner of my eye but my lizard brain decided she was a threat so I made some squeaky sound and kicked her arm away before she was able to touch me. It was pretty hard also. I never really decided to do it. I hadn't even turned my head to face her up until after the kick. I normally have the reaction time of a sloth and have never done anything like it before or after. \nWe just stared at each other dumbfounded for some seconds before I awkwardly walked away shaking from adrenaline. The entire time Pitbull was BLASTING on my earphones. It was a surreal experience. It took me a few blocks of walking on auto pilot before I realized I probably should have apologized \ud83d\ude2c", "Yes, but that is not happening so often. \n\nParents DO NOT parent most of the time.", "Agreed. It can be attention seeking behavior or and escape behavior but in the end, it hurts! And these kids/adults are strong. I\u2019m sorry that the mother demonized OP when really they\u2019re doing the right thing. \nPlus, if a non neurodivergent kid of 16 started grabbing your arm, nobody would blame you for shaking that off and saying no.", "Just from her description of the event, I could tell he was mentally handicapped, and OP kindly clarified that she could tell as well. I'm not trying to make a case for letting strangers touch you - I'm just saying you can usually distance yourself from a mentally disabled minor in a wheelchair without making them and their family feel like shit for being disabled/having a disabled child.", "No, I agree she should set boundaries. I just think when you are dealing with someone who is in a wheelchair and doesn't have the mental capacity to understand what they are doing is inappropriate, they should get a little bit more empathy than a typical 16 year old boy.", "I'm not arguing that you should stay and let someone touch you. I think it was totally fine you moved away from the disabled kid if you didn't want to be near him. I'm not sure if I am misreading this post, but your description is that he was a mentally handicapped minor in a wheelchair who, in an attempt to interact with you, \"patted you on the arm.\" (From my reading of it, you never mention him being violent or sexual.) It sounds like he did so because he does not understand social cues, and unfortunately, it sometimes takes parents years and years to teach a mentally handicapped person social behavior that comes naturally to the rest of us. All I'm advocating for is a little compassion while dealing with people who don't have an understanding of why what they are doing isn't acceptable.", "Something very similar happened to me. And I am still mad about years and years later. A little boy maybe about 4 just was grabbed my butt and kept his hand there. I looked at his dad to do something and he said oh he just likes to do that. I was so mad. I know the kid was just learning so I wasn't mad at the boy but at his dad for not correcting. I wish I had told the dad that it was inappropriate and that didn't work told the kid myself", "\\*raises hand\\* Yep, that's me. I've yeeted more than one person across a room, including people I was in a relationship with at the time. And I'm polite about it the first time! I'll block them, move away, and tell them not to do that, I don't like being touched there/like that. And once it's happened, I'm in the fight/flight/freeze space with the adrenaline going, shaky hands, all that jazz, so when they come back to do it again, my NO is ... a lot more emphatic. (Trying to avoid getting dinged about the whole violent content thing.) I grew up in the dojo because my Dad's a third (?) dan judoka, and I started when I was nine, so I know how to yeet people very effectively.", "Well, most people have spent a longer period of their lives touching people. Compared to a relatively short period of distancing.\n\nMore cynically - I work with the public in a place that was medium serious about social distancing. A solid majority of folks spent 6m-12m forgetting to distance, then went back to behaving normally.\n\nI really wish it became normalized, but tbh it never really did.", "Just because someone doesn\u2019t have the capacity to understand, doesn\u2019t mean the person setting the boundaries is wrong.

Out of instinct I gripped the arm of the person grabbing it *hard* and twisted to get them to let go. I realized as I turned around that it was a very young girl and let go. The parents had the audacity to yell at *me* while saying \u201cshe only wanted to play games on your phone! she didn\u2019t know! what\u2019s wrong with you!?\u201d.

Ugh.", "Absolutely this. Im not offended by hugs, usually, but Im also not really into hugging literal strangers. That would be extremely weird where I live.\n\nHeck, shaking hands is considered pretty formal. Usually when meeting new people casually its a head nod or wave. If im introduced to soneone at work Ill offer a handshake because I know that makes a good impression, or I guess if my parents were introducing me to someone.\n\nBut a hug would be right out, unless we're related.\n\nThat being said, some of my best friends arent touchy people. So, I always ask or offer. Especially if someone is upset. IME, *asking* if they need a hug often results in a yes that probably wouldnt have been welcome if I just went for it. Ive hugged coworkers after hard stuff before, people who arent touchy but just...need a hug - after asking if theyd like a hug.\n\nIve also had folks say no, and thats fine too. Just vecause my instinct is to hug soneone if theyre upset or if something exciting has happened, doesnt mean theyll like it.\n\nIts so weird that consent isnt yet the default...", "GOD i hate it when this happens, about to make me say \"I'm a STABBER\"", "Yeah, and I'm not the kind of person who hugs a lot anyway, so by the time I'm asking I usually either suspect they'd want to or I trust them to say no if they don't", "Agreed! I have hugged very non-touchy folks at their request frequently. But not asking feels honestly wild"]}
