I was standing waiting for an event to start (friend went to grab snacks) when I felt something brush against my arm. I didn't think much of it because like I said, this park gets busy and sometimes that can happen. A few moments later, I felt another brush against my arm. I glance back real quick and I see a teen (16?) in a wheelchair. Shortly after, I feel a hand grab onto my arm. I pull away and try to move a little further. The teen grabs my arm again and starts patting me. I say \"No\" and pull away to leave. As I start walking away I hear the mom (assuming) yelling out that her kid is special needs and is being loving and doesn't hurt anyone. Pretty sure she called me ableist but at that point I had already walked off. \n\nAITA? I don't like being grabbed, I don't want any physical contact with someone I don't know.

That said \"No\" and then removing yourself from the situation is a complete sentence and should have been respected, or the mom should have intervened at that time. \n\nThere is nothing ableist about not wanting to be touched without consent and saying no to touch without consent and removing yourself from a situation. \n\nI worked with special needs teens and adults when I spent a number of years volunteering for a major Special Olympics competition.  We were absolutely told that it was okay to say \"No\" to unwanted touch and that the athletes were taught to respect that.

You have the right to decide who touches your body; full stop. Where the disability comes in is how we judge the teen for touching you in a way that would ordinarily be inappropriate: they don\u2019t know any better so we don\u2019t impose formal liability or social ostracism on them, as we would for a non-disabled person doing the touching. But nothing about the disability changes the fact that you can react verbally and remove the unwanted touching from your body.\n\nThe mom needed to have been more conscious of what was going on. If she had happened to miss this, but generally was on top of it and was apologetic, N A H. But her reaction makes her the asshole here.", "NTA. You don't have to give up your personal space or autonomy because a kid wants to touch you. You don't owe any part of your body to anyone. Mom needs to teach her kid to ask PERMISSION to touch other people.", "NTA because you shouldn't be touched if you don't like it but nuance would factor into it. Would it have been nicer if you smiled at them and said no thank you before walking off? Sure. But if you simply said no and removed yourself from the situation that's totally fine. If you had scolded or yelled at them or given a nasty look or something then yeah that's a little mean and you'd probably be the asshole.", "NTA   Next time, scream \"SEX PERVERT\", and don't stop.", "The fact you're questioning yourself I'd say you're not an AH, but you definitely could/should have handled it differently. Now you know for next time. Everything in life is a learning experience.", "NAH you can choose to remove yourself but also when non speaking people try to reach out for social interaction it\u2019s nice when people don\u2019t shut that down because it\u2019s not typical", "I'm going to go against the general consensus here and say YTA, but in as gentle a way as possible. When someone has special needs, it is an AH move to make them and their family feel as though they are being a nuisance/making you uncomfortable. To be clear, it was completely fine and appropriate of you to pull away and put personal space between you and the teen, but you were a jerk to say \"no.\" That is what you say to a dog who jumps up on you, not a child who is trying to interact with you but doesn't understand how to. That mom reacted badly because parents of mentally disabled children agonize over the way people treat their kids, and they constantly have to apologize just for having  their own kids out in public. She probably felt sick to her stomach when she saw your interaction with her kid. It wouldn't surprise me if she dwelled on it the rest of the day. I know it was a small moment in time for you, but it really would have made a huge difference in that family's life if you had just smiled politely and moved your arm without saying anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This grown man with down syndrome shows up out of nowhere after the bars had closed, starts to hit on my friend and he won't take no for an answer, chasing my friend around, repeatedly saying that she's being discriminatory by not letting him hug her, because clearly she's a terrible person who hates people with down syndrome if she won't let him hug her. \n\nSaying it in a way that sounded like he was repeating something his mother or father had told him about how if girls say no to him, they're being discriminatory. It was incredibly disturbing. He also kept saying all kinds of inappropriate sexual things. \n\nHis parents had clearly raised him to believe he could touch people regardless of their consent, because people aren't allowed to tell him no.\n\nIt's like parents like this think that their child will be a child forever and that people will continue to make allowances and think having them violate personal space is cute because the parents do.", "Not wanting to be touched doesn\u2019t make you ableist, it just makes you a person who doesn\u2019t want to be touched. Goodness, the mom should have intervened and done something to stop her daughter or put more distance between y\u2019all, not gotten mad at you and called you ableist. You were totally in the right to remove yourself, especially since the mother wasn\u2019t doing anything to stop or prevent it and it didn\u2019t seem like she would stop touching you without intervention or you moving away.\n\nShe isn\u2019t doing her daughter any favors by refusing to intervene. She could have taken preventive measures, like it\u2019s unlikely this is an uncommon behavior for her daughter (wanting to touch others I mean). Maybe it\u2019s something she enjoys for sensory reasons, maybe she wanted your attention. If it\u2019s sensory then there are ways to find objects that can provide the same or a similar stimulation/sensation, if it\u2019s attention then the mom should be making sure to give her attention and helping her learn how to ask for attention/communicate in other ways.\n\nI\u2019m autistic and I didn\u2019t speak until I was nearly 5, my parents didn\u2019t do anything to help me learn ways to communicate. Now they act like it\u2019s some funny story to talk about how I was the \u201ctemper tantrum queen\u201d and it\u2019s not funny to me. I was a child having meltdowns because I couldn\u2019t communicate what was wrong or what I wanted. If people had walked away because I was having a meltdown that would be totally understandable, my parents should have been doing something to help me. The mom should be doing more to help her daughter rather than acting like you\u2019re ableist for not wanting to be touched by a stranger. If someone who wasn\u2019t disabled kept touching you and grabbed your arm I highly doubt you would\u2019ve been okay with it.

In those cases, the caretaker should certainly still take the person out in public, but try maintain a space around the special needs person so that they can't reach anyone.  This should be even easier to do in a case where the person is in a wheelchair.  And if the person does manage to reach out and grab someone, the caretaker should still \"correct\" the person and apologize to the person who got grabbed - apologize not only on behalf of the person who did the touching, but on their own behalf, for not preventing the action.

One time back when I worked in a movie theatre I went in to check the theatre at the halfway point and didn't realize a friend of mine was already there to do it. He gave me a light touch on the shoulder from behind to let me know, but I panicked and thrust my elbow right into his solar plexus. He was a scrawny kid and went down like a ton of bricks. I felt terrible.

I tried to be quiet about it, but it was extremely apparent I was not okay.

Like what happens when the sister licks a complete stranger?", "I had this situation happen to me last week, and I felt I was quite nice about it. The little shits behind me were 6 or 7-year-old little girls. Who were squealing quite obscenely at a dB that would make birds explode (like on Shrek). It wasn't just me who was squirming in the bleachers. Now, to be fair, we were at a Pep Rally, at the High School, so it was LOUD in there. They were just LOUDER! The more I plugged my ears, the louder they squealed. I honestly didn't know they could get to that octave until about 6 or 7 people around me plugged their ears. That's when I remembered I had earplugs from a recent flight. I turned around, looked at the parents, smiled, held up the earplugs, and said, \"I am willing to raffle these off to the highest bidder! All proceeds will go to the Spirit Organization here at the school for when these two lovely young ladies become cheerleaders!\" Everyone around me laughed, the parents glared at me, but they shut them up when people started bidding at $100.

I am hypervigilant to intrusions into my space without *meaning* to be, and am very very sensitive to touch. It's mostly a subconscious reaction created by past situations.\n\nShort version?

What the comment said was: \n\n> If he\u2019s so special needs **he can\u2019t keep his hands to himself** he shouldn\u2019t be in public.\n\nThat's a huge difference. And it's not just because it might make people uncomfortable, as it did with OP. If he is unable to process the word \"no,\" and genuinely is incapable of learning to keep his hands to himself, eventually he will grab the wrong person and they're going to be hit on reflex. Maybe they have PTSD from sexual assault, child abuse, domestic violence, or the military, for example, and are going to throw their elbow back upon being grabbed from behind. That's a lose-lose situation for everybody.", "I'm actually very huggy with people that I know, but I've never understood why people don't ask? A lot of my friends aren't big on physical affection. I do high fives with them mostly and only ask if I can give hugs on specific occasions.

I\u2019m gonna stop now for myself, but thank you for your measured response.  I appreciate it, truly.", "the weirdest is when my customers want to hug me?!? like who hugs the tire guy", "I understand completely. My response is shaped in part that for some time during COVID, my partner and I were full-time caretakers to my non-verbal nephew. This was a fear that went through our heads every day; if he never reached a phase where he could be safely taught to be around other people and their physical personal boundaries, we would constantly be worried about these interactions. More specifically, that inadvertent harm could be caused. \n\nFor now, he does appear to be learning at least somewhat, and he's still at a very young age where people are forgiving. But eventually, he will be a teenager, and then a grown man, and we're hoping that he'll learn enough to understand simple concepts like \"no\" before then. Otherwise, we're putting him and others at risk. It's an awful situation and I empathize completely."]}
