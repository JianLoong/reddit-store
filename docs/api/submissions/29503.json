I was standing waiting for an event to start (friend went to grab snacks) when I felt something brush against my arm. I didn't think much of it because like I said, this park gets busy and sometimes that can happen. A few moments later, I felt another brush against my arm. I glance back real quick and I see a teen (16?) in a wheelchair. Shortly after, I feel a hand grab onto my arm. I pull away and try to move a little further. The teen grabs my arm again and starts patting me. I say \"No\" and pull away to leave. As I start walking away I hear the mom (assuming) yelling out that her kid is special needs and is being loving and doesn't hurt anyone. Pretty sure she called me ableist but at that point I had already walked off. \n\nAITA? I don't like being grabbed, I don't want any physical contact with someone I don't know.

That said \"No\" and then removing yourself from the situation is a complete sentence and should have been respected, or the mom should have intervened at that time. \n\nThere is nothing ableist about not wanting to be touched without consent and saying no to touch without consent and removing yourself from a situation. \n\nI worked with special needs teens and adults when I spent a number of years volunteering for a major Special Olympics competition.  We were absolutely told that it was okay to say \"No\" to unwanted touch and that the athletes were taught to respect that.

Otherwise, they're going to get in trouble one day.", "NTA, I don't care about someone's disability, don't touch me.", "NTA, but she was for yelling at you.

Kid's gonna get pepper sprayed or something if mom keeps acting like this is ok. Nta.", "NTA. The kid didn\u2019t have a right to touch you without your permission.

You don't have to be nice or polite when strangers start touching you.

You have the right to decide who touches your body; full stop. Where the disability comes in is how we judge the teen for touching you in a way that would ordinarily be inappropriate: they don\u2019t know any better so we don\u2019t impose formal liability or social ostracism on them, as we would for a non-disabled person doing the touching. But nothing about the disability changes the fact that you can react verbally and remove the unwanted touching from your body.\n\nThe mom needed to have been more conscious of what was going on. If she had happened to miss this, but generally was on top of it and was apologetic, N A H. But her reaction makes her the asshole here.", "NTA. You don't have to give up your personal space or autonomy because a kid wants to touch you. You don't owe any part of your body to anyone. Mom needs to teach her kid to ask PERMISSION to touch other people.", "NTA because you shouldn't be touched if you don't like it but nuance would factor into it. Would it have been nicer if you smiled at them and said no thank you before walking off? Sure. But if you simply said no and removed yourself from the situation that's totally fine. If you had scolded or yelled at them or given a nasty look or something then yeah that's a little mean and you'd probably be the asshole.", "NTA   Next time, scream \"SEX PERVERT\", and don't stop.", "The fact you're questioning yourself I'd say you're not an AH, but you definitely could/should have handled it differently. Now you know for next time. Everything in life is a learning experience.", "NAH you can choose to remove yourself but also when non speaking people try to reach out for social interaction it\u2019s nice when people don\u2019t shut that down because it\u2019s not typical", "I'm going to go against the general consensus here and say YTA, but in as gentle a way as possible. When someone has special needs, it is an AH move to make them and their family feel as though they are being a nuisance/making you uncomfortable. To be clear, it was completely fine and appropriate of you to pull away and put personal space between you and the teen, but you were a jerk to say \"no.\" That is what you say to a dog who jumps up on you, not a child who is trying to interact with you but doesn't understand how to. That mom reacted badly because parents of mentally disabled children agonize over the way people treat their kids, and they constantly have to apologize just for having  their own kids out in public. She probably felt sick to her stomach when she saw your interaction with her kid. It wouldn't surprise me if she dwelled on it the rest of the day. I know it was a small moment in time for you, but it really would have made a huge difference in that family's life if you had just smiled politely and moved your arm without saying anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm this person, if you touch me in a public environment my reflex will be \"I'm in danger I need to defend myself\" and probably will hit with my elbow or hand whoever is touching me. There's is nothing justified in touching someone who's a stranger, the mother should apologize and not enable.", "I'm not saying op needed to be more aggressive, she handled the situation great, it's just that so many comments are like \"nta because you weren't rude\", implying that if she was, than she would be an asshole, which imo is very wrong, your comment is just the top one and I wanted this sentiment to be seen. I don't disagree with anything you said.", "not wanting mentally ill/disabled people in public > people feeling shame for their mentally ill/disabled family members > sending those mentally ill/disabled people away, shutting them inside the home, treating them like they are lesser because of it. i understand that might've been a bit of a leap for me to take but it really isn't that huge of a territory. and it wasn't really all that long ago that we were doing shit like that", "and it's not even like i think OP was in the wrong. I think the mother of this kiddo has some work to do and absolutely should've stepped in and told their child to stop grabbing at a stranger. i also think saying someone with special needs shouldn't be let outside is ableist fucking bullshit, but it's reddit", "Same. I hate getting touched by people I don\u2019t know. The thought of it freaked me out.", "I\u2019m not autistic and absolutely hate when people I don\u2019t know touch me.\n\nAlso why is everyone so obsessed with hugs as a greeting? I don\u2019t know you, I don\u2019t really want to touch you at all and I absolutely do *not* want to hug you. And then *I\u2019m* the rude one. \ud83d\ude11", "Absolutely. I am right there with you. As a women who is on very petite side I have on several occasions been harassed for not being \u201cnice\u201d etc when men feel entitled to my kindness or space which is the worst lol", "We're talking about special needs kids that touch people without consent. I think there is also some room for what \"public\" means. Maybe a huge overcrowded chaotic place is not a good place to take somebody who might act out more in that type of scenario, like a state fair. Going to the store at a quiet time where people aren't forced to stand near the kid might be a better public outing. Hell, going to the state fair when it's not that crowded.", "Exactly.  OP is NTA and mom handled the incident poorly.  But obviously it\u2019s cruel to say he should be kept inside.  Honestly I\u2019m really thrown by the downvotes on your comment.  I need an internet break."]}
