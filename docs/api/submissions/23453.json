It\u2019s your right, he\u2019s there full time, paying the bills and so on\u2026 but she was your child first but she\u2019s clearly been replaced by kids 2 through 4 and the husband who is driving the move and making sure there is no space for her in the (alleged) family home.", "YTA OP.

She can't have the spare room because he needs it for a huge desk and tread mill. She can't have a sleeper sofa because he also wants to game in that space. I think he will always have an alternate need for any space you suggest finding for your daughter. He needs to grow up and compromise.  Move the desk to the living area. Let him game in his office. This is your home too. If you want to make a place in it for your daughter, he should respect that. Also, if you don't have anywhere for her to stay, she will never be able to come home for any holidays again.
