Get out and get as far away from all of these people as possible.", "Nta. \nYou have become the living carer. That was your boyfriend's goal. He wanted you to be the live-in carer that he gets to screw. He wanted you to be a stay-at-home spouse, without any respect or any actual real discussion on how that would look. And your friends, have probably now been blinded by everything good that you have said about him over the last year. And I'm not saying that's your fault. You didn't know any better. But, your friends are probably not the best source for advice right now if they're telling you to put up with verbal abuse.\n\nLet me pose it to you this way. If your friend came to you, and told you everything that you were dealing with, and said that that was what she was going through, what would be your advice to her?", "Please you are not the AH, please leave ! Please please leave. And i would suggest leave and then tell .. because i am just scared to imagine what will happen if you tell him first.

This is not a healthy situation and you are beeing used\u2026 the age gap is an issue since you were only 18 and he almost 30 when you began \u201cdating\u201d.

And wow did your friends do a 180, first disapproving of the guy and now shaming you for wanting to leave an abusive relationship.\n\nDefinitely do whatever you can to leave, save up money or better yet find help at a women\u2019s shelter.

This is abuse.\n\nHe\u2019s isolated you, he\u2019s made you financially dependent on you, and now he\u2019s added that emotional gut punch to keep you there. Add on the newer development of him being verbally abusive, and it\u2019s only going to escalate.\n\nYes, the age gap was a red flag. Work on getting yourself out now. Don\u2019t let him know, you\u2019ll have to just leave one day. If he gets one hint that you have money squirreled away he will absolutely find it or make you give it to him.", "Your friends are so wrong. You are being used and abused, this is why age gap relationships are bad - hes manipulated you into being a carer and cutting off your freedom to work under the guise of love so that he can slack off and slowly abuse you now youre locked in.

Please, move away as soon as possible. And probably also find yourself better friends. And block him on all platforms, this sounds awfully like domestic violence or at least a start of it. They have to deal with their problems, you're not responsible for them and you did all you could when it was still bearable.", "NTA. And get some better friends, they are asking you to give up everything to accommodate a man and his mother, not the advice your friends should be giving you.

Your bf can take care of himself and his mother.", "NTA.

You are incredibly smart to move out, I respect you and admire the ability to know when enough is enough.

He never wanted to get a place just with you, it was his plan since the beginning to find someone who's gonna quit their job, leave with him and his mom and being their maid and caretaker. Now that he has you and had more control over you (especially financially), he doesn't care anymore, that's why he's drinking more and being nasty to you.\n\n\nHe groomed you. There's a reason why he was looking for someone way younger, barely an adult. I'm s because it was easier for him to manipulate and women his age wouldn't take his crap. I'm his age and I can't imagine looking at 18-22yo and think about them as equal partner. The age gap was and is an issue.\n\n\nSave money and run away as soon as possible.
