That kind loving man (who is so sweet he takes care of his mom).. is NOT a kind and loving man. He is a man who found a vulnerable teenager already isolated from parents/ adult influences- and then said all the \"right things\".\n\nHe gradually placed more restrictions on your time, and in an emotionally manipulative way, so that you felt you couldn't say no (who wants to say no- I won't help your disabled mom). Asking your partner to leave work (aka your financial independence and an outlet to others' opinions) is a control tactic. Asking you to burn your reference by always having to leave,  extra not ok. Suggesting he take care of you- comes across as generous and partner oriented, it isn't. It is removing a young person's access to resources and forcing them into a dependent state. This is financial abuse.\n\nOnce you were dependent on him, he could relax his \"courting\" act and now you are seeing his end goal- you dependent on him. *He is emotionally abusing you with the comments. Do you feel smaller after he says them? Guilty? Anxious? Angry? --- this is manipulation & abuse*. He is emotionally abusing you by ensuring you are dependent on him, he already knows you don't have parents to fall back on.\n\n*He can count on your relational inexperience to know you don't know/ understand/ feel that his behaviours are not \"normal\" or \"ok\". This is why grooming is so successful. This is why so many young people- especially girls fall prey to older men grooming them into an abusive relationship.* *You just don't have the life experience to know any \"better\". Be DAMN PROUD of yourself for recognizing that this is off and deciding you are ready to stand up for yourself and to be treated better.* You are a good and strong person regardless of your choices. It is very hard to walk away from the good memories and a life built with someone- it's ok to miss the good parts. But, thse good parts DO NOT outweigh the negatives. Remind yourself of that as often as you need to. You are not a user, you are not weak, you are not stupid. You were taken advantage of by someone you wanted to trust, because part of learning to love is learning to trust, and that inherent desire for both drives you to overlook red flags, especially when you are young. *This is a goodbye you learn from.*\n\n**So yes- save money. And alert the bank that you are preparing to leave a domestic abuse situation and that nobody else has access to those accounts. Do not keep the apps on your phone. Do not sync them to your google/ apple/ samsung etc accounts.**\n\nSet up an entirely separate/ new email and set of accounts for your private information and banking. Prepare for the possibility that you will likely need to change your phone number.\n\n**Connect with local women's shelters and support services. They can help you safely extricate yourself when you are ready. They can often connect you with tangible resources, housing, and even job boards/ networks.** Friends telling you you're an a-hole- NO. HARD FULL STOP NO. His mother is not your responsibility. He is not your responsibility. You are likely correct in assuming he won't take you leaving well, and listen to your gut/ spidey-senses on what to do to ensure your safety. **If you can leave sooner, just leave.** If you can start taking out a bag a week of clothes do so. Or plan what you need vs can leave behind, or who can come for a safety/ security person on move out day. If you do meet him to talk after, only ever do so in a public and neutral place, with short time frames and have something definitively set after so you can't be tempted to stay. It is very easy to fall back into old habits.\n\nIf available in your area, connect with accessible (look up Citizens Counselling), university offered, religious if applicable or other counseling services- these will widely vary by area, and quality varies. But, if nothing else, will give you an unbiased person to talk things through with, and big feelings about this are absolutely ok. If library/ app is more accessible take out some books/ audiobooks and read about: grooming, domestic abuse tactics, feel what resonates. Often these books have suggestions on ways to process and manage the isolation, shame, hurt, and other emotions that come from living through such experiences. \n\n**Final note, you've got this.**", "Leave", "NTA.

You're very young and you have no obligation to waste your time, money and early career on an abusive boyfriend's mother. \n\nNTA OP. Get away, and invite your concerned friends to take over your position and care for the sick mother. Find a new boyfriend and friends.", "She also get a glimpse of the rest of her life if she stays with him. You know which one that I mean.", "He never started. She is the live in carer he doesn\u2019t have to pay and can sleep with.", "Yeah, tbh this is good advice. Get some help from an organization that helps victims of domestic violence (he may not be hitting you but he is abusing you financially and emotionally), and leave even before you have the money saved.

Drop those \"friends\" because no reasonable person would tell you to stay and put up with that shit.", "This. There\u2019s always a trade off when someone purports to take care of everything financially. That trade off is your freedom. It isn\u2019t too late. Get out of there.

This was always the plan on his multi step long con\u2014getting you to move in with him, then annoying you at your job to leave to go change his mum, etc, etc. It was never going to be any different. \n\nThis is a classic abusive technique actually starting with dating someone so young and naive.

I love my husband but I still keep money in an account that doesn't get touched. \n\nA women's shelter would be the best. Get out. Do not let him have a way to contact you. Do not tell your \"friends\" where you are. Move away from these people. Start your new life. You can't let your feelings of leaving them without a caregiver get in the way. Run.", "Yep - you're dead right. I shouldn't have specified women who date men at all - my bad.\n\nI do think the financial isolation involved in the abuse described above is one aspect of DV / DA that is particularly common in hetero male-to-female direction, from the point of view of division of labour / work / care and gender roles (I've never seen a man manipulated into giving up job, friends, and become an isolated carer, something depressingly common with women, but of course it must happen to men sometimes) etc, but listen, you're still right - and just because a man isn't being financially isolated *as part of the abuse* doesn't mean he might not struggle to afford to run away without a dedicated fund to help him. \n\nI've only ever heard running away funds discussed between women - let's spread the word to guys, too.", "Run.", "NTA and please just find some Non profit or whatever and leave as soon as possible, try to reach people only you know and ask for help, you can save all the money you want later when you regain control of your life.

You should never depend on a man with your life. Put your foot down and tell him you're going to have a job and start building a safety net so you can leave. If you feel like he won't allow you to have your own money, that should be enough of a red flag to make you realize you need to run.", "Get out first.  Find a women\u2019s shelter or similar.  It\u2019ll be easier to find work when you don\u2019t have to be sneaky about it. They may even have resources to help you find a job.\n\nI guarantee he will try to get you pregnant so it\u2019s even harder for you to leave and you\u2019d still be forced to deal with him even then.

For years I have always tried to advocate for true equality between men and woman, but damn is it hard. Too many men still being sexist pigs, and too many woman thinking they are better than men. \n\nThat said, your advice to OP is 100000% sound advice that everyone should follow.

Any womens' group will help you get there and you could start again somewhere new, but with support. It maywell be your easiest and fastest way of leaving this abusive situation. I wish you all the luck, and I realise that moving somewhere new may wrll seem very scary, but it will improve things for you and it's better than what you have now."]}
