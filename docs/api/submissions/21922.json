Also, why bring this up when your sister suffered a loss like that? It\u2019s just cruel.", "Your family have reacted to the info they have been given. Go tell your side of the story and see how they feel then.", "NTA. It is just the truth and the way your father handled things was/is awful. You can be grateful but still, she isn't your mom and never will be unless YOU feel otherwise.", "NTA. So...your sister had a miscarriage and your dad decided this is the best time to have a go at her for not sharing the pregnancy news with her stepmum? What a piece of work. I don't think you said anything wrong here.", "NTA", "NTA. Your dad sounds very controlling. If that's a product of having to raise three kids in a difficult situation, that's one thing. But he likely needs counseling to break the cycle. You're all adults now. He needs to start seeing your point of view and stop controlling the narrative, like he has done by turning your stepmom and family against you. He definitely has to stop gaslighting you and your siblings. This is not good behavior.\n\nIt can be tough to get family onboard for therapy, but maybe start by going  yourself, OP. It could at least help you navigate your situation. And if others see you benefitting from it they may buy into it too. Good luck, OP.", "Pity your father and stepmother didn't have Reddit to see how this always goes down.\n\nYes it is his fault more than your stepmother's. You didn't need a replacement mother. trying to force one on you resulted in this poor relationship.\n\nNTA", "NTA but your dad??? Major AH! You didn\u2019t ask for a replacement mom, and to pressure you guys into calling her \u201cmom\u201d is insane. Stepmom should have also took the initiative to tell your dad to lay off if she was such a damn mom. Don\u2019t apologize neither of you, you guys deserve the apology", "This might be an unpopular opinion but ESH... other than your step-mom unless there is something I am missing here. You say that your mothers health made her not a good partner or mother... and I am confident that you know that to be something of the truth. It wasn't her fault, sometimes things just can't be gotten over I know I've seen it plenty.   \n\n\nSo your father is a bit of AH because he started in with the mother comparison when your mother was still alive and continued it after her death. That is your father and he is very much a jack-wagon for trying to do that. However, I think maybe there was more there that hurt him that he didn't push off onto you kids because he was trying to protect you from some uncomfortable truths. He seems bitter and resentful toward her even now which to me says there is stuff you don't know and maybe shouldn't know about your parents lives together.   \n\n\nYou and your siblings now are a bit of AH because... you say that your step-mom was like a cool older-sister or fun aunt. Did that stop or are you just holding what your father did against a poor woman who seemed, from how I read this at least, to be someone who was just trying to be a loving partner and step-parent which isn't an easy thing to do all the time. Yeah, your dad was wrong to try to force the \"she is your mom and the only mother you have\" especially when the grief was still so raw for you and your siblings. Did your step-mother try to do that aggressively or did she just sort of go along with the husband? Neither is great, but one is at least understandable because she was thrust into this situation, yes there was a choice, but would you rather her and your father just remained apart and your father to be even more bitter and resentful?   \n\n\nMy advice would be trying to understand the step-mother here, she comes off as something of a victim as I read this. If she isn't a jerk then don't hold what your father did that messed things up against her. The future is a long time OP, regret doesn't go away, and bitterness is a double edged sword. Allow yourself and your siblings to heal if you can... allow your step-mother to heal... set a boundary with them certainly but just decide what you really want long term. Best of luck OP, I may be totally off base with my advice, but I hope if I am not it is at least somewhat helpful for you.", "YTA\n\nBy your own admission you guys don\u2019t like because of your dad you are unfairly punishing her for what your dad did\n\nShe was there was for you and from the sound of it was a better mother than the one you had\n\nYou seem entitled have it don\u2019t realized how lucky you had it", "YTA \n\nBy your own admission you guys don\u2019t like because of your dad you are unfairly punishing her for what your dad did\n\nShe was there was for you and from the sound of it was a better mother than the one you had \n\nYou seem entitled have it don\u2019t realized how lucky you had it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Any good parent would be devastated that their children went through what you did.", "NTA\n\nYour father is abusive. Look up parental alienation.", "If she had been reasonable she would've told her husband how inappropriate he was acting in front of the OP and their siblings", "NTA this was what occurred to me, that stepmom isn't the guilty party here but dad. if you can cut dad out of it and talk to her. it will probably be for the best. She did try to be a step mom to you and probably feels she wasted a chunk of her life-but it wasn't her doing but dad who poisoned the well.", "My dad can be a dictator at times and my step mom is pretty go with the flow, any time he\u2019s said something really out of pocket. She\u2019ll step in but most of the times she really tried not to intervene whenever something was happening with our dad and us", "I agree, it\u2019s unfair that my stepmom is caught up in all this but honestly if you\u2019d been there listening to my dad yell for 30 minutes straight you\u2019d go crazy. \n\nNot my proudest moment", "I do feel for stepmom and honestly this whole argument was not any of our finest hour. \n\nWe had an amazing relationship before my mom passed \n \nMy dad is really good at getting to your head and so while he\u2019s to blame. \n\nIt can be really hard to be with stepmom without it feeling like I\u2019m betraying or trying to replace mom", "Yes, encourage op to cut off her only parent just because he tried to get them to accept step mom", "OP has said in other comments that step-mom has repeatedly intervened before", "I think sending a link here would be helpful. My guess is you articulated your feelings better in this description than you did in person during that high stress meeting.", "May I say it looks like your father may have been drumming this concept into your stepmom to the point that she now feels bad that she's not measuring up to what your father is demanding of his children.", "Your dad's the AH here.  Sounds like you need to have a heart to heart with your stepmom once this all blows over.  Maybe she can make your dad realise how much of a dick he's been.", "It would probably be beneficial to have a conversation about this directly with her without your father around", "Well OP said she's gotten caught up with Father's drumming this stuff into everyone's head.", "So you are taking out your anger on your step mom for things your Dad is doing? \n\nIf you were an adult, I'd definitely say Y T A but as it is my ruling is:\n\nteenager", "I think one day you\u2019re going to be forced to come to terms with the fact that, despite your stepmother receiving 90% of the hostility, your father is 90% of the problem.", "[removed]", "NTA. But stepmom seems cool. Your Dad has a point but yelling and shouting wasn\u2019t the right move. I think your dad is to blame maybe try and get along with stepmom though.", "God, I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone being happily married to your dad. Being told to be the mom but also have no voice to being an equal partner??? I really don\u2019t know why you focus on the stepmom so much, when your dad is clearly the one creating problems for you.", "So all your comments point to you only having one parent, and that's the step-mom.\n\nBeing parent us about your actions, no biology. \n\nYour mom stopped parenting at 5 from what you said due to severe mental illness.  And your Dad is an unstable \"dictator\" \n\nSo who's actually been raising you?", "If you aren\u2019t already in therapy, please go. Your dad needs to be in therapy too because he\u2019s obviously very angry at being neglected and/or abused by his ex-wife and left to raise 3 kids on his own. Although he has a right to his own feelings, he needs to keep those feelings to himself or share with other people that are not his kids. Obviously isn\u2019t coping well, none of you are. \n\nThere is zero betrayal going on. Life is for the living. Life is short. Don\u2019t let someone go who is wonderful and could be such a beautiful part of your life. There are very few people in life that actually genuinely care about you. Don\u2019t throw that away without fighting for it.", "Also I don\u2019t hear any mentions of SM telling the children that they do not have to call her mom if they don\u2019t want to. Ofc I don\u2019t know if she ever has but she\u2019s an adult and it would be the kind thing to say to mourning children who are hurting.", "Ah I hadn't seen that. \nI take back what I said about stepping up, poor woman is entirely just stuck in the middle. \n\nIt's a shame dad is hurting four people for this crap", "I think your dad is to blame maybe try and go with the step mom.", "Yeah, I was thinking that OP needs a strategy here.  I'm not sure what the right one is, but he she wants relatives to know what happened first, she can tell them:\n\n> Throughout our childhood, from Mom's mental illness to her physical illness to her death, and for years after, Dad has persistently pressured us to elevate my stepmom, resulting in an inevitably backlash.  When Mom was alive, he would point out her inferiority to his wife, and, after she died, he  pressured us to call stepmom 'Mom.'  Given the sheer insensitivity of all that, it's no wonder, then, that we do not trust them with the most intimate and vulnerable aspects of our lives.  The wisdom of keeping them at arm's length is emphasized by the fact that he dealt with my sister's crisis and ultimate tragedy by berating her for half an hour - complete with name-calling - for not including them in it earlier.  I was called 'cruel' for coming to her defense and explaining all the above.  Perhaps my word choice could have been better, but I'm glad I said it, and I hope the message gets through this time.  Our family relationship has largely been determined by Dad's years-long disparagement of Mom, with this being only the latest casualty of that treatment.  The relationship will not be repaired by more pressure, more berating, and more disparagement of us to the rest of the family.", "I doubt he\u2019d let us get a word alone with her without having to apologize to them both first", "In the heat of the moment I was reckless with my words yes \n\nBut outside of that, I can\u2019t speak for my siblings but I\u2019m not taking it out on her per day but it\u2019s more like \n\nWe\u2019re being made to choose between mom and step mom, so choosing stepmom feels like betraying mom", "I think I said it in an earlier comment, my dad very much is a problem but he\u2019s done such a good job at making it easier for us to dislike her\n\nLike for example If she cooks a meal my mom used to make I can\u2019t eat it without internally hearing my dad comparing the two\n\nWhile it\u2019s his voice in my head, it\u2019s still mom vs stepmom which is unfair to stepmom but I don\u2019t know", "You want op to cut off her only remaining family because he tried to make his kids and step mom get a long ??", "And to poison the memories of their mother by negative comparison all the time. NTA", "Ops father keeping them safe from their unfit mother is not parental alienation \n\nIt seems like there\u2019s a lot op doesn\u2019t know about her mom so her father could be justified in his thinking but didn\u2019t do it right", "My step mom and dad have been raising me and prior to my mom dying we were really close with our stepmom, our mom was there to reassure us and she loved step mom but since she\u2019s gone, his comparison just seem more hurtful", "Or maybe we wear that because again THE WOMAN IS DEAD. \n\nTalking up ALL her negative ways because SHE WAS A SICK WOMAN profits nothing. \n\nAnd again, SHE IS DEAD. \n\nExactly what is putting her down to her children, negatively, going to accomplish for the living?", "Unfortunately at some point we all learn that our parents are very imperfect and very human. \n\nIt sounds like your dad likes to get in between people's relationships. I wouldn't doubt that he's been berating your stepmother to be more of a mother and building her up to take on that role more in private. So she maybe seeing this as a failure to live up to his expectation of her just as he is attacking you all for not living up to his expectation of you.\n\nI think some distance and some time will help when you can move out. \ud83d\ude14", "Although i agree he's the reason you guys have a strained relationship, your stepmom doesn't really deserve the hate\n SHE wasn't the one making comparisons, your dad was. She wasn't shoving herself into the mom role, HE WAS. NTA for setting him straight OF COURSE, but maybe give the poor woman a break?", "I actually feel really sorry for your step mum. Doesn't sound like she's done anything horrible to you at all. It's all your dad ruining your relationship.", "Maybe let her know she's alright, but your dad is doing everything possible to make you hate her. And she might want to talk to him if she wants you all in her life for more than two seconds after you can leave.", "Your dad is making your step-mom feel like she isn\u2019t appreciated by you guys, when you guys have done nothing. Your dad is making you guys feel like your stepmom is pushing boundaries to overtake your mom, when she hasn\u2019t done anything. I think your dad is lonely and he\u2019s the one that wants attention, but he probably doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s getting it, as he\u2019s getting it.", "Can't you call her? Maybe when you're pretty sure your dad is not close by? I'm sorry this happened, NTA.", "Your step mom isn't even part of this argument. \n\nIt's your Dad vs the memory of your Mom. \n\nHe is the one saying this stuff. Not your step-mom who you said has intervened repeatedly. \n\nStop taking out your anger from your Dad's actions out on other people. \n\nHe's the one saying this stuff", "I'm so sorry, honey, that's so screwed up and unnecessary.", "Hey, it\u2019s normal to want to maintain your bond with your primary/original parents. We\u2019re social beings and our family is our first and most fundamental social unit. Our parents inform our identities and how we see ourselves belonging in the world. \n\nAll of that is to say this: it makes sense that you\u2019d unconsciously view stepmom as, perhaps, the cause for your fathers behavior. That if she weren\u2019t there, he wouldn\u2019t be shoving her down your throat or comparing her to your mother. But the truth is that this is who your dad is, and he\u2019d do this with anyone who became your stepmom. \n\nYour stepmom is your co-victim of your fathers emotional/psychological abuse. If you talk with her, and let her talk back, you may find her to be an ally in this situation. Good luck. And NTA.", "I\u2019d hope that if someone went on a relentless campaign to compare you to an ex-partner you\u2019ve never tried to compete with, you would not end up the primary target of their family\u2019s resentment.", "They WERE getting along. That wasn't good enough for him. He repeatedly said some really hurtful shit to his children about their mother who had DIED in order to force their feelings into line with the fantasy family he created in his own head. \n\nIf you think you can deliberately hurt people on a routine basis and not get a bunch of resentment in return, you're just as delusional as OP's dad.", "You can protect your kids without comparing moms like he did, or demanding the children call step mom mom after her death. Your going too far without the existing context being addressed. He already had custody, he didn't need to trash talk her.", "She was already *dead* when the worst of this went on, so he clearly wasn't just \"keeping them safe from her.\" He was endlessly telling them that their mother was worse than their stepmother at anything and everything, when there was absolutely no need to compare (even if it were true), and he was trying to force them to call their stepmother \"Mom\" and treat her as a mother when they were still grieving for their own. That IS alienation.", "Oh, that's brilliant \ud83d\udc4f NOT.", "He's the one doing it though. Are y'all in therapy for your mom's death? Could you at least talk to the school counselor?", "Being dead does not clear her of any wrong doing \n\nMaybe comparing was his way of showing the kids what they have so they don\u2019t take it for granted", "I came here to say the same thing pretty much!", "They're all about hitting that age. That whole brain growing thing is partly an evolutionary advantage. Teens rebel against their parents and tribe. This pushes them out to go join/start new tribes of their own. This keeps inbreeding down and keeps populations in check. Then as the brain fully develops the children begin to see their parents as people as well as parents. This helps to keep neighboring tribes from fighting each other.", "Absolutely this.\n\nMy mom and stepdad just celebrated 20 years married this year.\n\nI\u2019m really pissed off at my mom right now and not really talking to her. Spoke with stepdad on the phone recently and he asked me very respectfully why I\u2019d been avoiding them - on the spot I realized I owed him an apology on top of an explanation, and of course he advocated for my mom because she\u2019s his wife, but it was clear he was instantly relieved, and that he\u2019d taken my radio silence more personally than I\u2019d ever intended. Needless to say I was feeling like an ass for that, but I am so glad I simply told him that it wasn\u2019t his words and actions (or lack thereof) that had upset me.", "Yeah she\u2019s honestly been pretty solid,  my dad is just good at what he does. Which is getting everyone riled up", "You can\u2019t alienate them from a parent who was barely there and Is now dead", "Ugh I\u2019m having a hard time coming to terms with this with my parents, but they\u2019re both my bios and still married. I have some issues with my dad, more than I care to remember, but tbqh he\u2019s done a much better job of repairing the relationship than Mom ever will. This comment section is a bit of a kick in the ass to start treating our relationships separately even though they tend to be kinda codependent.", "I guess you know this, but you're dad's an AH. \n\nWhat's with these guys that so thoughtlessly raise and say such negative stuff to their children? Frankly, if your bio mom had been in better health, she could've taken him to court for parental alienation. That's a real thing and more parents need to know that.", "No, but you can sure try. And that can deeply hurt the child. Whether or not the parent was barely there, she was loved. Children are hard-wired to love their parents, and it usually takes an enormous, conscious effort and a lot of therapy to put that love aside if the parent's behavior makes it truly necessary. \n\nIn this case, because she was dead, it *wasn't* necessary to stop loving her. Their continuing to love and mourn their mother wasn't going to put them in any kind of trouble, the way trying to spend time with her when she was alive but in an unstable condition might have done. It was pure peevish resentment on the part of their father, to try and force their stepmother down their throat as \"your mother now.\" He didn't have any necessary or even useful parenting goal involved in forcing them to listen constantly to how bad their mother was, or in demanding that they abandon their love for her in order to replace her in their hearts with a stepmother."]}
