Also, why bring this up when your sister suffered a loss like that? It\u2019s just cruel.", "Your family have reacted to the info they have been given. Go tell your side of the story and see how they feel then.", "NTA. It is just the truth and the way your father handled things was/is awful. You can be grateful but still, she isn't your mom and never will be unless YOU feel otherwise.", "NTA. So...your sister had a miscarriage and your dad decided this is the best time to have a go at her for not sharing the pregnancy news with her stepmum? What a piece of work. I don't think you said anything wrong here.", "NTA", "NTA. Your dad sounds very controlling. If that's a product of having to raise three kids in a difficult situation, that's one thing. But he likely needs counseling to break the cycle. You're all adults now. He needs to start seeing your point of view and stop controlling the narrative, like he has done by turning your stepmom and family against you. He definitely has to stop gaslighting you and your siblings. This is not good behavior.\n\nIt can be tough to get family onboard for therapy, but maybe start by going  yourself, OP. It could at least help you navigate your situation. And if others see you benefitting from it they may buy into it too. Good luck, OP.", "Pity your father and stepmother didn't have Reddit to see how this always goes down.\n\nYes it is his fault more than your stepmother's. You didn't need a replacement mother. trying to force one on you resulted in this poor relationship.\n\nNTA", "NTA but your dad??? Major AH! You didn\u2019t ask for a replacement mom, and to pressure you guys into calling her \u201cmom\u201d is insane. Stepmom should have also took the initiative to tell your dad to lay off if she was such a damn mom. Don\u2019t apologize neither of you, you guys deserve the apology", "This might be an unpopular opinion but ESH... other than your step-mom unless there is something I am missing here. You say that your mothers health made her not a good partner or mother... and I am confident that you know that to be something of the truth. It wasn't her fault, sometimes things just can't be gotten over I know I've seen it plenty.   \n\n\nSo your father is a bit of AH because he started in with the mother comparison when your mother was still alive and continued it after her death. That is your father and he is very much a jack-wagon for trying to do that. However, I think maybe there was more there that hurt him that he didn't push off onto you kids because he was trying to protect you from some uncomfortable truths. He seems bitter and resentful toward her even now which to me says there is stuff you don't know and maybe shouldn't know about your parents lives together.   \n\n\nYou and your siblings now are a bit of AH because... you say that your step-mom was like a cool older-sister or fun aunt. Did that stop or are you just holding what your father did against a poor woman who seemed, from how I read this at least, to be someone who was just trying to be a loving partner and step-parent which isn't an easy thing to do all the time. Yeah, your dad was wrong to try to force the \"she is your mom and the only mother you have\" especially when the grief was still so raw for you and your siblings. Did your step-mother try to do that aggressively or did she just sort of go along with the husband? Neither is great, but one is at least understandable because she was thrust into this situation, yes there was a choice, but would you rather her and your father just remained apart and your father to be even more bitter and resentful?   \n\n\nMy advice would be trying to understand the step-mother here, she comes off as something of a victim as I read this. If she isn't a jerk then don't hold what your father did that messed things up against her. The future is a long time OP, regret doesn't go away, and bitterness is a double edged sword. Allow yourself and your siblings to heal if you can... allow your step-mother to heal... set a boundary with them certainly but just decide what you really want long term. Best of luck OP, I may be totally off base with my advice, but I hope if I am not it is at least somewhat helpful for you.", "YTA\n\nBy your own admission you guys don\u2019t like because of your dad you are unfairly punishing her for what your dad did\n\nShe was there was for you and from the sound of it was a better mother than the one you had\n\nYou seem entitled have it don\u2019t realized how lucky you had it", "YTA \n\nBy your own admission you guys don\u2019t like because of your dad you are unfairly punishing her for what your dad did\n\nShe was there was for you and from the sound of it was a better mother than the one you had \n\nYou seem entitled have it don\u2019t realized how lucky you had it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
