Were these happy kid laughing  yells, or were they blood-curdling shrieks? It's tough, because there are kids in the neighborhood whose yelling and laughing during the workday doesn't bother me a tiny bit, but there's one kid I call The Shrieking Child whose play voice is just... the most ear-piercing, blood-curdling SHRIEK you can imagine. I feel terrible because when she starts up, I want to march outside and slap duct tape over her mouth, even though none of the other kids bother me... I guess what I'm saying is, it's kind of hard to tell if I can't hear the kids in question. \n\nI'm leaning toward ESH, partly because according to you this went on for two hours.

On the other hand,I've walked over and politely asked Shrieker's playmate's parents to reign her in one time (she doesn't live here) but I didn't go outside and scream for her to shut up. I think I'm not the only one though, because it seems like they don't invite her over any more.", "EHS. Of course, the neighbour could have asked kindly to keep it down.

Regardless of whether you're in your yard or not, and what time of day it is - the sound isn't contained to your yard.\n\nEditing just to add that if it was a weekend then I'd say NTA, but considering it's a work day and she has now asked you, then you need to be considerate of that.", "YTA yes your enighbor could have asked nicer but you should have stopped being an annoyance and bad neighbor after they said they can hear the shrieks through closed windows", "YTA. Adults need to teach children to be respectful. No, they don't have to be totally silent, but screaming is not okay unless they are in danger.", "It depends. Some kids just laugh and yell and whoop while other kids shriek their little throats off in high-pitched exclamations of sensory torture.\n\nIf it's the former, N T A. Kids are going to make some noise and I think that's fine. However, if your niece and nephew have never been taught to have a considerate volume, or have been encouraged to be extra loud by having parents who are also extra loud, and they scream like little dinosaurs constantly for hours, then Y T A, especially because it is a work day, and I imagine this will continue throughout the summer. Its possible to have fun without trying to break the windows and cause edricht insanity with sonic attacks from beyond the void.", "ESH - I am a little torn on this one. Daytime noises (kids, car horns, yard work) are to be expected and your neighbor could have put on a fan or a white noise app to help block the noise, and could also have asked nicely before yelling.

But I consider it a bit socially rude that they did it for hours and even after it was made known to them that they were disturbing the neighbors.", "WFH or not though, a couple of kids screaming repeatedly for hours is really not normal backyard noise. That's excessive and pretty inconsiderate.", "We have a trampoline family across the street, and they have three boys who scream and shriek every day and into the early evening. They are on everyone's shit list.\n\nYTA", "It\u2019s easy enough to tune out a lawn mower as it\u2019s a constant noise that doesn\u2019t change pitch.  Screaming kids is totally different.", "That kind of neighbor wants a war? Bring it on.  I\u2019ll rent a bounce house and invite all the kids in the neighborhood.  Sugar them WAY up.  No one tells innocently playing children to shut up around me.", "Normal outside play is fine.  The occasional (like once a couple minutes) shout or bark is fine.  \n\nConstantly top of lungs screeching or dog barking for 2 straight hours?   That's a problem.\n\nMost places do have a dB limit for noise complaints or general excessive noise laws.  There's a difference between normal outside play and screeching.  Shouting and laughing and occasionally shriek is fine.  Constant top of lungs is not.", "But screaming for 2.5 hours is NOT normal. That's not a normal thing at any yime of the day, especially when it's not because somebody is in danger. People/kids can be loud and have plenty of fun without screaming is the point.", "Gotcha", "Within reason", "thought that, but the vast majority of half terms were last week (the usual bank holiday week each year) or the week prior", "Omg their entire school was off the day this happened. Stop your incessant chatting about fines over something that is perfectly legal.", "I live by an elementary plus huge playground and basketball courts, plus the Jr HS is maybe 2 blocks away... I WFH, and there is no such thing as quiet time except at night lol.  It's not great when they're out screeching at all decibals, but kids are gonna kid \ud83e\udd2a", "It\u2019s not summer break in the UK, it is school term time.", "I agree with you. My niece (4) and nephew (7) visit my in-laws upstairs (the house is like a duplex), and their idea of 'playing' is running around being chased and screaming in excitement (and also likely for attention), also riling up the dogs which then start chasing them and barking. This inevitably ends with tears when a dog gets over-excited and nips one of them, rinse and repeat. For hours. I mean, I'm glad they're having fun, but I feel like encouraging non-stop screaming when playing is not the best idea. For anyone. My parents certainly didn't put up with that when we were growing up lol ... but they weren't great parents anyway, and I'm not a parent, so what do I know.", "This is ALL of my neighbors, there are probably 10-12 I can hear with their constant noisy yard maintenance devices. Do I complain about it to my partner? Yes. Do I yell at them to stop it because it bothers me? No, I just put on headphones and move on with my day.", "I once worked in a start-up where we continued to work in the office during an office remodel. Happily (or not-so-happily as the case may be) click-clacking away on our keyboards while construction workers proceeded to take down walls, put up new ones etc. All manner of hammering, drilling, sawing and the like for \\*weeks\\*.\n\nMatter of fact, now that I think of it, that same thing happened at two different start-ups over the years. In neither case did I get even mildly rich off of any sort buyout or IPO. Thinking maybe I did the start-up employee thing wrong.\n\nI'd take kids-happily-playing noise over dude-with-a-sawz-all noise any day.\n\nNTA", "Yes, why is this suggestion so buried?

I love you, friend.\n\nLOL", "Planners absolutely would put commercial buildings in residential areas. The corner of my road has a shop, post office, laundrette and fish and chips shop. They are historically very common. They might not allow heavy industrial use but standard retail is pretty normal.", "I'm not actually allowed to work anywhere other than my home. And I've known people be reprimanded for working in the garden", "Same. I wfh twice a week. Our neighbor across the street in one side have young children, the others have young grandchildren over sometimes. They'll play outside. They'll squeal and scream. It can be annoying as hell, but I'm also happy to hear kids being active outside and not glued to a screen. Even when I'm working...\n\nWhat's arguably worse than that is our next door neighbors having a lawn crew. It's about 30-45 minutes where I can barely hear anything. But then they're gone. And it's just one a week.", "I was taught this early and passed it to my son. Don't scream unless you're bleeding. Laughing, giggling, carrying on is all fine. But screaming is for emergencies.", "I'm always baffled by the ppl who find the sound of kids playing \"annoying\". I wouldn't want two hours of a kid having a tantrum but screaming while playing is so different. \n\nI have a friend who's like this and always thinks kids should be more grown up/in control of themselves than age would suggest. I did ask and she claims her and her brother never screamed as kids during play. I don't understand.\n\n(Neither of us have kids fwiw).", "They're all legitimately pathetic morons and this whole thread and all the upvotes is truly a depressing reflection on ignorant sheltered redditors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone complaining about kids playing loudly in any capacity is almost certainly a miserable slob.", "It\u2019s when it\u2019s quiet that you have to worry! \ud83e\udd23", "Kids playing outside is fine.

Once when we were at recess, some kids were playing some game that involved tossing and catching a basketball. One of them ran after it and wasn\u2019t paying attention, so they ran full tilt straight into me and I flew a few back and smacked my head on the pavement. After like half a minute, 4 teachers were surrounding me and trying to get me to the nurse\u2019s office. One of them *very frantically* said \u201cWe\u2019re so sorry!!! We thought it was a fun shriek!\u201d\n\nNever even really processed that moment until now, but that makes the events even funnier somehow."]}
