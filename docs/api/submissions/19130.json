But I understand that I could have always opted to go to an office setting or even to the town library if I wanted silence. I have earplugs for when they are being noisy outside. But I don't scream for them to shut up because they are kids and they are doing exactly what kids are supposed to be doing...playing. now if someone is screening in the middle of the night, that's a different matter, especially since my town has a noise policy for late hours.\n\nIt's your house and as long as it's not all day or at night, she has no right to stop you from playing with your niece and nephew.

Perfectly reasonable for kids to be outside playing and making noise. Or people to be outside mowing their lawn or listening to music.", "NTA.  Since this noise is on an infrequent occasion, I think it is not a problem.  Your neighbor should exhibit a little more patience.  If this was every day, then sure, I would agree with the neighbor, but it is not.", "NTA, imo if you work from home you have to deal with the cons of choosing that. One being, there are going to be noises happening at any time of the business day. What\u2019s she gonna do when a contractor has to come through, or an ambulance comes through? She opted to work from home, if she can\u2019t deal with normal occurrences during a regular business day she either need to find another location to work from or go back to the office.

Two hours is not much time, you're in your yard doing what you want. You are entitled to use your yard as you see fit mid day, whether it's mowing or playing. Again MID DAY for only about two hours, she could have asked nicely and if you persisted you would have been the ah but you didn't.", "NTA.

It's summer and kids should be playing outside.

Your neighbour can put on a headset.", "NTA - it's ur home", "Ntah.  I\u2019m sorry they were loud and making noise but when does the neighbors have more rights than you and your family.

Part of life is the fact that kids are noisy. Middle of the day, on your own property? Not at all.", "NTA. This is one of the drawbacks of working from home.", "NTA it's well within your right to play with children during daytime hours. It's not reasonable for your neighbor to expect quiet at that time. It's on them to soundproof their home if they want to be insulated from regular noise during the day.", "Kids laughing and shouting while playing is a far cry from screaming.\n\nToo many people let their kids scream as if they are being murdered and never try to tone it down at all. \n\nHappy kids playing is not a troublesome sound, but incessant screaming is unbearable.\n\nFrom your post, OP, it sounds like you were the AH. Teach your niblings not to scream all the time, there's no need for it.", "NTA\n\nyour neighbor can go elsewhere to work, the children have less freedom.", "NTA your neighbor doesn't seem to realize they work in a residential area and not a commercial building.

There are certainly benefits to WFH (I work from home as well) but that's a downside.  You're doing nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nAll she had to do was to come and ask politely if it would be possible to lower the volume a bit so she could work.

I *have* to work from home and going into the office or anywhere else, really, isn\u2019t a possibility for me.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not summer outside and that I\u2019m entitled to everyone in the neighbourhood being quiet during the day. Kids can still play in their own or family member\u2019s backyard or in public spaces near my home. \n\nI used to live near a middle school and would hear the kids play and scream in the schoolyard for multiple hours every day while I was working. I also rented a basement apartment for a while and a family with young children (toddler and a baby) lived upstairs. They would walk/run in the house (a toddler\u2019s steps are surprisingly loud lol), talk loudly, cry and play right above my head for hours while I worked/sleep. Because they\u2019re kids being kids where they had the right to be.\n\nI would put on ear plugs, head canceling headphones or listen to music, simple as that.", "NTA.  You are at home.  Not your fault the person chooses to work from home in a residential area.   If they expect quiet they should go into the office or rent an office space somewhere", "NTA it's in the daytime on your property. Good grief.", "2 plus hours of screaming kids, and you wonder why your neighbour complained. YTA kids don\u2019t need to constantly scream to have fun.", "NTA. Your neighbor is rude and unreasonable. It's summer and kids are at home.

Middle of the day. Kids exist. It's an infrequent scenario. \n\nWe adults who work from home have to deal with the sound of children loudly playing sometimes. \n\nWould she be shouting out the window to a group of burly men blasting music or a council worker using power tools to fix the road? A large group of people having a barbeque? Doubtful. This is just some asshole who clearly thinks her shit doesn't stink and sized you up as an easy target that would take being shouted at.\n\nAlthough she did you a favour as you had an excuse to end the game after two hours.", "NTA- I feel for people being distracted while working, but 2 hours of kids playing outside in the summer is normal.", "YTA. You weren't the AH when you started. However, once you realized that it was disturbing a neighbor who was working, (WFH is *working*, people!) you should have quieted down. I get that she wasn't pleasant about it, but do you really want to start shit with your neighbors when you could have played another game that didn't require screaming?", "I actually think it depends. Were these happy kid laughing  yells, or were they blood-curdling shrieks? It's tough, because there are kids in the neighborhood whose yelling and laughing during the workday doesn't bother me a tiny bit, but there's one kid I call The Shrieking Child whose play voice is just... the most ear-piercing, blood-curdling SHRIEK you can imagine. I feel terrible because when she starts up, I want to march outside and slap duct tape over her mouth, even though none of the other kids bother me... I guess what I'm saying is, it's kind of hard to tell if I can't hear the kids in question. \n\nI'm leaning toward ESH, partly because according to you this went on for two hours. I think I'd be tired of it by then if I was the kids' actual parent, at that point. On the other hand,I've walked over and politely asked Shrieker's playmate's parents to reign her in one time (she doesn't live here) but I didn't go outside and scream for her to shut up. I think I'm not the only one though, because it seems like they don't invite her over any more.", "EHS. Of course, the neighbour could have asked kindly to keep it down. But also, you should consider the noise and the fact that not everyone wants to hear kids screaming for extended periods of time, moreso if they're trying to work. Regardless of whether you're in your yard or not, and what time of day it is - the sound isn't contained to your yard.\n\nEditing just to add that if it was a weekend then I'd say NTA, but considering it's a work day and she has now asked you, then you need to be considerate of that.", "YTA yes your enighbor could have asked nicer but you should have stopped being an annoyance and bad neighbor after they said they can hear the shrieks through closed windows", "YTA. Adults need to teach children to be respectful. No, they don't have to be totally silent, but screaming is not okay unless they are in danger.", "It depends. Some kids just laugh and yell and whoop while other kids shriek their little throats off in high-pitched exclamations of sensory torture.\n\nIf it's the former, N T A. Kids are going to make some noise and I think that's fine. However, if your niece and nephew have never been taught to have a considerate volume, or have been encouraged to be extra loud by having parents who are also extra loud, and they scream like little dinosaurs constantly for hours, then Y T A, especially because it is a work day, and I imagine this will continue throughout the summer. Its possible to have fun without trying to break the windows and cause edricht insanity with sonic attacks from beyond the void.", "ESH - I am a little torn on this one. Daytime noises (kids, car horns, yard work) are to be expected and your neighbor could have put on a fan or a white noise app to help block the noise, and could also have asked nicely before yelling. And while kids playing noises are normal, screaming for 2 hours is excessive and is not really nice neighbors behavior either.", "Are you in the wrong for continue to disrupt others despite knowing you're disrupting them? Yes. The answer is yes. The neighbor could have been nicer but YTA", "I\u2019m pleased I don\u2019t live next door to you.
