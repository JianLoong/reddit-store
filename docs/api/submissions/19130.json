Were these happy kid laughing  yells, or were they blood-curdling shrieks? It's tough, because there are kids in the neighborhood whose yelling and laughing during the workday doesn't bother me a tiny bit, but there's one kid I call The Shrieking Child whose play voice is just... the most ear-piercing, blood-curdling SHRIEK you can imagine. I feel terrible because when she starts up, I want to march outside and slap duct tape over her mouth, even though none of the other kids bother me... I guess what I'm saying is, it's kind of hard to tell if I can't hear the kids in question. \n\nI'm leaning toward ESH, partly because according to you this went on for two hours. I think I'd be tired of it by then if I was the kids' actual parent, at that point. On the other hand,I've walked over and politely asked Shrieker's playmate's parents to reign her in one time (she doesn't live here) but I didn't go outside and scream for her to shut up. I think I'm not the only one though, because it seems like they don't invite her over any more.", "EHS. Of course, the neighbour could have asked kindly to keep it down. But also, you should consider the noise and the fact that not everyone wants to hear kids screaming for extended periods of time, moreso if they're trying to work. Regardless of whether you're in your yard or not, and what time of day it is - the sound isn't contained to your yard.\n\nEditing just to add that if it was a weekend then I'd say NTA, but considering it's a work day and she has now asked you, then you need to be considerate of that.", "YTA yes your enighbor could have asked nicer but you should have stopped being an annoyance and bad neighbor after they said they can hear the shrieks through closed windows", "YTA. Adults need to teach children to be respectful. No, they don't have to be totally silent, but screaming is not okay unless they are in danger.", "It depends. Some kids just laugh and yell and whoop while other kids shriek their little throats off in high-pitched exclamations of sensory torture.\n\nIf it's the former, N T A. Kids are going to make some noise and I think that's fine. However, if your niece and nephew have never been taught to have a considerate volume, or have been encouraged to be extra loud by having parents who are also extra loud, and they scream like little dinosaurs constantly for hours, then Y T A, especially because it is a work day, and I imagine this will continue throughout the summer. Its possible to have fun without trying to break the windows and cause edricht insanity with sonic attacks from beyond the void.", "ESH - I am a little torn on this one. Daytime noises (kids, car horns, yard work) are to be expected and your neighbor could have put on a fan or a white noise app to help block the noise, and could also have asked nicely before yelling. And while kids playing noises are normal, screaming for 2 hours is excessive and is not really nice neighbors behavior either.", "Are you in the wrong for continue to disrupt others despite knowing you're disrupting them?
