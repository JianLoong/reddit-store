Just no. It's going to be very weird. People don't name their kids something like Apple or Autumn either. It's just not appropriate in the culture. There is much less freedom and no tradition to name kids after brands, objects, seasons, cities etc. It's very different frtom the US culture so it's not a good idea to judge one country by the traditions and culture of another.", "I suggested, but it seems like they\u2019re dead set on the name.\n\nI guess Subarus are considered pretty good and reliable cars in Russia, but it\u2019s still an unusual name. And to make it worse, the car\u2019s name is pronounced as \u201csubAru\u201d in Russian, even though the original pronunciation is \u201csUbaru\u201d.", "Right but OP is also sharing a name with a car and has said it negatively impacted them.", "Repeating conversations is common for this sub, to provide the commenters with more context, which is what he is doing.", "So Ladamir \ud83d\ude05", "Daaamn. You'd had been picked on even in Latvia since we had those cars too lol. \ud83d\ude00I'm so sorry for you, and I think you're NTA because being picked on is the worst, and why would someone purposely choose that to their kid?", "Huh, learn something new every day!   \n\n\nIt's nothing wrong with the name, and I agree that it's meaning is beautyfull, but in the western part of the world it will be a somewhat strange name for a person.", "Yeah, it's a beautiful name. Too bad associations make it difficult in in some places.", "That\u2019s him & that\u2019s too bad. I\u2019m sure there were also people who were gay & it negatively impacted them. Are they supposed to just say \u201chey, you\u2019re right society. You\u2019re going to make fun of me so I\u2019ll just not be gay\u201d. \n\nPeople are going to ridicule you. Get over it. You don\u2019t allow people to dictate your life.", "LMAOOO\ud83e\udd23", "Bro, you got a good sense of humor, and I love it ..Cheers bud"]}
