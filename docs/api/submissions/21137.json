I immediately got very upset and said I couldn't believe he was saying this after the conversations we had just had. He said going to the gym was important for his mental and physical health so he needed to go. I said I really really needed a break NOW, and asked if he could at least go later, e.g. in the evening, so I could get a proper break first.

You weren't forbidding him from the gym completely, just asking him to go at a time that worked better for the family. \n\n>and that I could just rely on his mother to help out for a few hours (we live with my in-laws) and went anyway.\n\nSince HE was changing the plans, he should have made the alternative childcare arrangements. \"I'm going to the gym, ask my mom for help\" is a very different statement from \"I'm going to the gym *and I've already talked to mom*, who will watch Baby while I'm out.\" The first one dumps more mental load on you by forcing you to plan for childcare and navigate a potentially inconvenient conversation with your mother-in-law. The second takes all that work off your plate and ACTUALLY allows you to relax.\n\nHonestly, all the stuff about his mental and physical health is kind of irrelevant in this situation. There were several options to get his gym time in and NOT shaft you on sleep, and he chose none of them because he assumed you'd just pick up his slack. Not cool.", "NTA. Did you ask him why he changed his mind after agreeing? Honestly NTA regardless because it sounds like he is specifically supposed to take over at that point anyway, but especially because you specifically spoke about it.", "NTA. It takes two. If he can't cancel or postpone going to the gym with friends for his wife and newborn baby, his priorities are off. No one's saying it's easy for him too or he doesn't deserve to have moments but... it's the gym. It'll be there tomorrow. So will his friends. It's not work. It's not family. He can deal.\n\nMaybe setup a word to let the other know you're in a red alert state and assistance is mandatory? Like a safe word.", "NTA You expressed a very very clear need for a break.  Those requests shouldn't be ignored, especially if you're the one up every night.  He knew you weren't ok and walked out anyway.", "NTA\n\nHis mental health is important, but so is yours. You had a hard night so your resources are stretched thinner than his at this moment. Therefore your mental health is a priority rn.", "NTA - But I am seriously wondering why you are married to such a selfish man and why you had a child with someone who blatently puts himself above everyone else.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing an awesome job, your husband is a selfish prick!", "I\u2019d say you were the asshole if you demanded he didn\u2019t go but for him to agree to watch his own child when you explained you needed sleep and then half an hour say he needed to go to the gym \u201cfor a few hours\u201d makes him sound like a teenage babysitter, not a responsible father. It\u2019s not unreasonable for the primary caregiver to ask him to go slightly later so you can get rest. \n\nJust wondering OP - how much of his life and lifestyle has changed since you had a child? And how much of yours has? Worth thinking about.", "NTA. Something to think about - even without considering the baby, how much does your husband do for himself vs you or his mom doing things for him? \n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out just how much of an asshole he is, the whole \u201cbut my friends wanna hang out NOW, so I\u2019m leaving for a few hours! have fun with the baby while you\u2019re sleep deprived, make my mom help you instead!\u201d situation really sounds like an immature 15 year old trying to get out of babysitting their younger sibling.", "NTA. Your husband is being a misogynistic, selfish prick. This is a huge red flag tbh.", "NTA.  He should have stayed back and helped out.  He really needs to spend time with both of you actively engaging as a family.\n\nBut, OP, this is really common so pls don\u2019t have a huge fight about it with him. Breastfeeding makes it challenging to know how he will fit in besides being \u201cthe diaper guy\u201d.\n\nAnd you also need time away from baby and outside the house.  Self care.\n\nAdd in the whole growth spurt and cluster feeding deal and it\u2019s just a tough stage.\n\nIdk if this is happening right now, if it is I\u2019d ask his mom for a specific time frame to help out so you can stretch/shower/meditate outside and get a little relief.\n\nWhen your husband comes home, see if he engages with baby.  If not, suggest he take a walk with baby and care for them until x hour so you can nap and pump more supply.\n\nHave him look into baby yoga, stretching, mild exercise as a way for dad to have a responsibility.  Baby\u2019s trainer. Oh and dad should be bath champion.  \n\nExplain it as how to involve him in your communication and it might help out a lot.  \n\nJust my thoughts/experience.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been there with breastfeeding and I would say he wasn't one IF you didn't just have a discussion about you needing a mental break. It is time, energy, effort, mentally consuming not only being a first time parent but also exclusively breastfeeding. And no that doesn't mean he gets a pass because what else can he do? He can support you and that in turn, supports the baby. It is HIS responsibility, not your MIL to tend to the needs of your child that you both made together. There's no reason for his lack of cooperation to default to his mom. Yes he needs to go out and refresh but you needed a time out much sooner and you asked him. He's wrong. You're NTA. But he needs a wake up call. I'd suggest you leave for a bit the moment he returns but as a BFing mom myself once upon a time, I know it's easier days than done. But do try to step away to mentally regroup.", "NTA - y\u2019all gon get a divorce if he don\u2019t start actin right", "NTA at all.\n\nYou made your needs very clear, he agreed to them. And then completely flipped it.\n\nAnd sorry if this pisses someone off, but you just grew a whole person in your body two months ago and have been solely responsible for that baby staying alive since then. Your husbands health is also important here, but yours is more so. \nThe priority later here is baby>you>him.\n\nTell your husband to get his shit together", "I wasn\u2019t sure until I reached \u201cfor a few hours with some friends\u201d.  If he wants to jog out the door and hit a few sets of push ups and will be back and ready to take the baby in a half hour then I might have sided with the husband.  \n\nA few hours with friends is a different story and more about recreation and socializing.", "OP is there anyway you could find yourself something for you time that removes you from the house? In the way that he needed to go to the gym I think even if you\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019d let you come round for a nap and then a drink+catch up (fyi drink cause I don\u2019t know what libation you like to have) it means you get your rest, you see someone to talk and clear your mind and most importantly you\u2019re not in the house if he suddenly chooses to change plans. It\u2019s difficult for you both right now I\u2019m sure but being the person who\u2019s always in the house means you\u2019re the constant fall back guy for your husband and he\u2019s not thinking beyond \u201cmy wife is there so baby is covered\u201d. \n\nI think you really need something for you that takes you away from the home so that if he wants to do something he has to think beyond you. You\u2019re doing well and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a way to work this out.

Cuz I exclusively breastfed and my husband didn\u2019t need to be told any of this. He just stepped up. Like an adult who had a baby.", "Ya but she sounds like she just needed to sleep. Unless he wants to foot the bill for her to check into a hotel for a few hours he should be able to help her out here", "He should have proactively asked his mother for help instead of making you do it.", "I would ask. Also it sounds like you need to have a conversation around what the role of his mom is, and why it is appropriate for her (FYI it isn't) for her to step in so he can do other things when he has agreed to take responsibility.", "I think it\u2019s difficult to apply our own experiences to everyone.  Some dads do need it spelled out. I\u2019m glad yours was clear about it.\n\nMine was not. He was raised in a sexist household so we did need to have those conversations to get things running smoothly.\n\nThey used words like \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d.  \n\nI later divorced him but he did step up during infancy stage.  He was a perfectionist which is a whole other issue lol.", "No I totally agree - my brain immediately thought a hotel bed but that\u2019s probably not what they want to do right now. Just I think the quickest way he\u2019ll learn not to rely on her is when the can\u2019t rely on her if that makes any sense", "I agree with you as well, kinda just leave him to fend for himself. Women\u2019s hormones also reset at a different time period than men\u2019s so we actually do need sleep more which he probably doesn\u2019t understand. \n\nIf it were me and I was promised a break and then got the change up- I\u2019m furious just thinking about it"]}
