Obviously it will only sleep contact napping. It\u2019s a newborn.  \n>  \n>All of the babies in our family slept fine in bassinettes so not as OBVIOUSLY as you appear to think.", "Yep. The baby is 9 weeks old - when they've been parents for more than 2 months, maybe they'll come up with a routine that allows for quick morning workouts, but the moment she said she'd had a bad night, it was up to him to take over completely. He can workout another time (or not, if that doesn't work that day - having an infant means sometimes you don't get to work out that day)", "He should incorporate the baby into the workout. Lift the baby, curl the baby, put the baby on his chest while he does crunches. make stupid faces while he does it, babies love that shit. They think it's hilarious. Use it as bonding time. Be a dad.", "OP, this is an amazing suggestion! And adorable.", "Babies love squats, and they make a nice weight vest if they\u2019re in a carrier.", "Your right, I've never been trapped because I wouldn't put up with it for anyone.", "Are you a man? Have you ever given birth? Have you been in any successful long-term relationships? Questions I need answered before continuing this conversation", "It\u2019s when the baby sleeps on you.\n\nNewborns are used to never being alone, they\u2019ve been inside mum their entire lives. They are used to always being warm, never hungry, always close. So when they are newborns they struggle with not having all those things. Once their original dose of melatonin has worn off (first three days or so) where they sleep all the time and wherever, they generally need to nap on someone to get to sleep. If you try and put them down they\u2019ll usually wake.", "Thank you for explaining, I had never heard of it."]}
