He is, especially after your conversation. Its so common for the at home parent (be it maternity or sahp) to become the default parent and the otger to become lazy over time on the ground that they 'work'.\n\nOnce my husband told me sounds like a nice day, lucky I didn't be at work, when i told them about the hell a park trip had been. I booked 6 days out that evening and you now what...he got it after that.\n\nYour husband is being an AH. Prioritising himself and fun breaks over you. He needs to see these comments. He needs to exercise as a release? Fine but not the moment too. He could have taken the baby for a walk/run instead and still got exercise. He knew you were breaking. Selfish.", "Yeah, it was the few hours with his friends at the gym that sealed it for me. I already thought he was in ahole but a few hours? No.", "NTA my baby made me fat.   I lost it back when walking started.   Also lost a lot of friends who didn't understand.   It's the sacrifice you make as a father.", "Wow.\n\nBehavior like this.... read him the riot act when he gets back.\n\nNTA OP.  Husband is gigantic A-H.", "NTA. He needs to take responsibility for his newborn.", "NTA. Your husband is coming across as dismissive of your need for rest. His mental health isn't going to decline if he delays his workout or even misses it for a day to help his wife who is struggling. I'd say sit down and have a serious conversation with him about how you feel, otherwise his behavior might continue because he doesn't understand the severity of both how you feel and how his actions are making you feel. I hope you're able to get some much needed rest soon. Being a new mom is no joke. Best wishes", "NTA.  Mental health is important but there is a scale of priority.  The over exhausted mother to a breastfeeding newborn comes in first, followed very distantly by the father of said breastfeeding newborn that gets a full nights sleep Avery night.\n\nAlso, you know what is just as important as mental health? Keeping commitments.  From context I am going to assume that the gym trip was not previously planned, which means he bailed on his commitment to you, which came first, to go hang with his buds.  Your husband is a dick and needs a reality check.", "NTA and as a mom of two reading this makes me furious. And your baby is only 9 weeks old?! \n\nBoohoo he needs a mental health break as opposed to the woman who carried said baby and has been up with them since they were born \ud83d\ude44 \n\nI would seriously consider waking him up at night for really trivial things or just diaper changes because some people just seem to take things for granted", "NTA - the gym is open many hours a day. You asked for help at that time, no need to leave then.", "Your husband thinks his mental health is more important than yours. He also thinks going to the gym with buddies is necessary instead of just going when it works for his family. He is the one who is being inflexible- not you. NTA", "Hes the asshole.  He has no idea how it feel to be up half the night taking care of the baby because hes not doing it.  Tell him do some push ups in the house to get his work out in. Staying up every single night takes  a toll on the mind and body . Do not feel guilty u are 100 percent in the right. Taking care of the baby takes priority over a work out.", "Excuse him?! \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s aware that HES THE FATHER OF THAT CHILD AND THAT HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AND PRIORITIES CHANGED THE SECOND THAT CHILD WAS BORN.\n\nHe absolutely sees you as the default parent and is not pulling his weight. He needs to step up and grow up. \n\nObviously not my decision but I wouldn\u2019t recommend having more children with him unless he can prove he can be a good father and a good partner.", "NTA.  You can't be the only making sacrifices.  I'm embarrassed for him play-acting at fatherhood.", "NTA. I am so tired of seeing these posts.", "Husband can suck it on 'needing this for his mental and physical health'..  He is getting a full night of sleep each night because his angel of a wife is willing to take on the full burden of sleep deprivation for nine solid weeks.  Sleep deprivation is categorized as torture.  She is willing undergoing torture for him, so he can sleep at night and he somehow things his mental and physical health comes before his?  That is a flaming pile of selfish bullshit.  He is treating her as the default parent and thinks he gets cookies for putting in any effort.  His job should be to take care of the baby solo for at least five hours a day so she can get a solid chunk of sleep before she gets too exhausted and drops the baby.", "What do u mean? He gives her hours of sleep every morning and feeds baby a bottle daily. I feel like OP is doing pretty good! Or maybe my standards are way off? I\u2019ve never had that type of help and I\u2019d consider myself so lucky to get it.", "As an breastfeeding mum to a small baby I just wanted to say that your wife massively appreciates you \u201cjust being there\u201d. \u2764\ufe0f It\u2019s honestly everything sometimes.\n\nJust incase she\u2019s too tired to tell you. \u2764\ufe0f", "This is what I was going to say. The logic doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Guessing you don\u2019t have a newborn? \ud83d\ude02", "1. Probably cause money.\n2. Why is that relevant?\n3. Why is that relevant?\n4. It\u2019s a newborn. Obviously it will only sleep contact napping. It\u2019s a newborn.", "Talk to MIL she needs to talk to son and get him to step ups", "He's an ass, it's his child so he should do some feedings.  She needs a break NOW and he can't put off his workout.  Are you kidding me.  The child isn't his mother's to help take care of, it's his child too.  it's obvious his needs come first before hers.", "She is 16 years old, lol.", "OP needs to talk to her husband. Husband is an adult and as such, should be able to speak with his wife about stepping it up. She doesn't need to run to MIL so she can speak to her adult son about prioritizing his families needs first sometimes. As a couple, this is something they need to speak to each other about."]}
