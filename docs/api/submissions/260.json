I took a friend of mine to a tattoo parlor for the Halloween flash sales,  they had just started two jobs and college and I thought this would be a nice thing for them to have as a personal reward. I let them know in advanced it would be a wait and I asked if they\u2019d be okay staying awake (this parlor is weird about patrons lounging in the waiting room and has multiple signs)They agreed multiple times letting me know they\u2019d be able to stay awake. Once we got there we filled out the paper work chose the designs and sat down. Within 10 minutes my friend is SNORING next to me loud enough to disturb the very last booth. The young woman up at the front asked me to wake him up and I happily did and said his name a few times till he woke up. He apologized readjusted and continued to fall back asleep multiple times even after being woken up by an artist and being asked if he\u2019d like to change the appointment so he could get some rest. He denied and I was called back while he was sleeping again for my tattoo. When I returned he was wide awake and chipper and talking to everyone in the waiting area. He was pulled back for a $40 tattoo which I was paying for, handed him $100 and told him to tip the artist $40 and give the rest back. After the tattooing was done and payments I found out when my friend who was his tattoo artist let me know he only received $40 meaning the guy I brought pocketed the rest and didn\u2019t bother tipping him at all. I called him out on it and he proceeded to go quiet and not say anything back. And then changed the subject entirely about my future appointments and he stopped by an ice cream shop before we made it back to my apartment. Where I proceeded to gather my things get out of the car and walk into my apartment, he then messaged me apologizing for the night not going how I expected it.

Tattoo artists I know say tips are pretty much their salary in some shops. For him to not do so and also keep the money you wanted back is disgusting.\n\nIf you had money I'd hope you go back and tip the artist, and then dump the friend. They don't seem to care about being decent and aren't worth your time on giving them a generous gift. The sleeping is by far the least of the issue.\n\nNTA leaning to mild ESH because you should have made him tip or done it yourself and cut your losses."]}
