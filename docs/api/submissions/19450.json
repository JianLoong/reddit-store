Don't be considerate of people who aren't considerate of you.\n\nNTA", "NTA they can\u2019t take up three parking spots out of sheer laziness. If you can\u2019t get in your spot, it\u2019s their fault that you have to knock on the door.", "NTA\n\nPersonal accountability could've been had by either of them in this situation.\n\nParking over the line in a complex would cause stupid unnecessary shit to occur.\n1) they caused it\n\n2) they didn't fix it\n\n3) you were affected by their negligence.\n\n4) their familial situation doesn't make them special or immune to having to do things as noted above.", "Nta\n\nThey'd rather you knock, instead of calling apt management or a tow truck.", "NTA The OP ask if they would\u2019ve been an AH if they did wake  someone up if they couldn\u2019t park. If you read carefully, you\u2019ll see they did not wake the family up.", "If you had to, then no, you're NTA. But since you don't have to and there's a chance they'll move before your wife is back then YWBTA because it's currently not interfering with anything and can wait.", "No NTA. Why don\u2019t you just mention this to them tomorrow morning. That way, they could be more mindful and in the event that they aren\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t feel like an AH for knocking on their doors at whatever time.", "NTA. You didn't choose to take up someone else's parking spot, and frankly it's not your problem that they have small kids. Granted, I am writing this as someone who is used to living in a big city with scarce parking; if parking close by is easy to do, I personally might wait to confront them about it the next day, to let them know to please not do it again. But you wouldn't be in the wrong if you did choose to confront them immediately, either.\n\nIf you really wanted to, you could probably have the car towed, since it's preventing you from parking. That would be far more of an inconvenience to your neighbors that potentially waking them up. The other comments saying that you would be TA are ridiculous, in my opinion. Lord forbid that your neighbors' shitty actions result in them getting woken up, if they're even asleep at 10:30pm. At least you aren't considering having their car towed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could park your car, very light inconvenience and it bothers you, understandably.\nBut it's nothing that couldn't wait until next morning. Take pictures, be polite, say you considered knocking right then and there but you didn't because of the kids.\n\nYou would not be TA if your second spot wouldn't have been available and it posed a imminent problem.\n\nSo", "IF you had to do it, you WNBTA. It\u2019s not your fault they created the situation.\n\nAlso, knocking on the door shouldn\u2019t cause such a stir, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re yelling through a loud speaker", "YWBTA. Your wife is out of town, you can park in her spot. It can wait until the morning.", "YTA if you do it. It's a pain that they do it, it really pisses me off when people block spots because of it. But if I accidentally did it a couple times and a neighbor knocked on my door late at night and woke up my daughter, you'd get nothing but an attitude. Waking someone's small kid up is way worse an offense than a mediocre parking job.", "NTA.  It is their mistake.  But I see no problem waiting until morning, then knocking, and if they do not answer, then leave a note.", "NTA. If they didn't want to be disturbed, they should have parked correctly.", "All the cars are parked, nothing needs to be done at the time. Why would you risk waking up those kids at 10:30pm over a hypothetical that can be be asked in the morning?\n\nEdit: why not leave a note?\n\nSecond edit: brought to my attention I misread and the question was if he could knock on a day his wife was there. In that case NTA. It would be nice if you could ditch the car elsewhere and handle it in the morning but regardless you should be able to ask for your spot when you need it.", "NTA but I'd maybe get ahead of the game now and try have a conversation with them. Let them know it worked out OK this time because your wife was gone but ask them to try bare this in mind when parking in the future as parking over the line has a knock on effect for others. Be polite about it unless it happens again then it'd be a bit more firm, depending on their attitude in response. I hate inconsiderate parkers lol", "NTA.", "Nope, NTA,\n\nThey are the ones that caused a situation that would require getting interuppted/awaken. \n\nDepending on your specific parking rules, assuming your wife is there, so no free spot to park. this is something that could end up getting you in trouble by having to park in someone else's spot or in visitor parking/somewhere else.", "NTA. Since you were able to park elsewhere this one time I would be proactively go talk to them before it happens again. Just be polite and let them know because if it does happen again, and your wife\u2019s not out of town, you don\u2019t want to possibly disturb their young kids.", "NTA\n\nI get it is an inconvenient time, and you\u2019ll probably catch at least some side eye. But they need to let you use your allotted space. If they\u2019d dine so to begin with, they wouldn\u2019t get the knock at the door.", "Exactly. I have 2 spots allotted to me, actually on my property. There\u2019s plenty of free street parking. I used to only use one, so my neighbours would take it upon themselves to use the other spot. I wouldn\u2019t have minded if they asked first, but they never did. The sense of entitlement blows my mind. It would be a different story if I parked in their spots. They would be pretty upset with me.", "Thank you for point #4. Yeah it would suck putting kids back to bed but kids do NOT absolve you of consequences for decisions!", "He's asking about if his wife was home. Read.", "What Sad said.  \\^\\^", "Your last line is what he's actually asking - if his wife was home - so then your decision should be NTA.", "OP is asking if they would be the AH if it happens again when they do not have an extra spot.", "If you don\u2019t want your kids woken up, don\u2019t park like an AH. Its that simple. Actions have consequences. Taking five extra seconds to make sure you parked correctly would prevent anyone having to knock on your door.", "He's asking about next time this happens, and there will be a next time, when his wife is home and her car is in her spot.", "I absolutely agree with this approach. NTA if you have to knock on their door because their cars are in the way but I'd definitely try to speak with them the next time you see them and try to get ahead of the problem.", "And I answered both. I said if he had to because his wife is home then no he wouldn't be but since his wife isn't home then yes he would be. So why don't you read?", "Bunch of illiterates on here", "Yea, purposely waking your neighbor's kids up is a great way to become a victim of vandalism. I myself am not violent but I wouldn't be shocked to see tires get slashed or a car getting keyed.", "You seem to not consider the children and their right to have a good nights sleep even if their parents are shitty.", "Oooooh. Well then I need to edit.", "It's not purposely waking kids up to knock on someone's door. Thanks for letting us know you're a criminal.", "Presumably the kids aren't sleeping next to the front door. God forbid someone's precious angel ever have to deal with any not-perfect situation", "Naw, it's purposely waking them up if you are banging on the door at 10:30 at night.\n\nNot sure how saying there are people who will escalate things makes me a criminal. You seem to not know what a criminal is."]}
