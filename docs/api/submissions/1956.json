This was our first ever house we each have had without living with parents/family. \n\nMy sister-in-law lived with her mum, stepdad, and her 4 kids (she\u2019s a single mother). They ended up losing the house because of financial reasons and pretty much had nowhere to go, so I told my partner that his sister and kids can stay with us until she gets her own place (One of her kids ended up staying with their grandmother).\n\nAnyway, so my sister-in-law and her 3 kids moved in with my partner, stepson and I into our small 3 bedroom house. We made it accommodating so we could all live comfortably together. At first we were pretty close and hung out a lot, but as time went by we started drifting apart. I think it was because of the fact my sister-in-law just stayed home all day, didn\u2019t get a job or even look for one, never helped out with the bills or rent and would just go out on dates with random guys she met online all the time. \n\nMy partner and I both worked full-time jobs and everyday I would come home and the house was an absolute mess because of all the kids! They tried to clean it but honestly there was no point because it would just end up going back to shit. I was so sick of it.\n\nThis went on for over a year, she still didn\u2019t have a job and was living here for free. I would tell my partner that she needs to move out but as she is his big sister he defended her (even though he was annoyed as well). She ended up getting a boyfriend and would let him stay over at our house with his 2 kids. That\u2019s a total of 9 people now in our 3 bedroom house. They would have fights in the house and even broke one of the bedroom doors. My partner and I were so pissed off at the lack of respect they had. They ended up replacing the door, but that was it I was over it. I started to put a list together of houses up for lease so she could start looking for a place. But she didn\u2019t seem interested.\n\nLater on I found out that she was actually speaking to my stepsons biological mother (who at the time was very jealous of my partner and I being together and having my stepson full-time) and trying to come up with ways to try and break my partner and I up. It was the ultimate snake move in my opinion. It didn\u2019t work. We had to sit her down and confront her about it.\n\nCan\u2019t really forgive her for it but still AITA for wanting them to move out knowing they kind of had no where to go and it wasn\u2019t the kids fault for anything ?", "created_utc": 1668086748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrewdz/aita_for_wanting_my_sisterinlaw_and_her_kids_to/", "score": 379, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has had a year of living rent and utility free. If she had gotten a job at the beginning of that, even a low paying one, she could have saved up more than enough to get her and the kids established. But she doesn't want to.

Not really sure how that works try posting in the legal forum. You absolutely need to legally evict her. But give her a written 30 day notice. Do it by sending it to her via certified mail so she signs for it as legal proof she got it. Good luck", "NTA kick her out", "NTA. She has had a year of riding the gravy train. Time to kick her off.", "NTA. You're right, the kids are innocent. But so are you, and your stepson. All are stressed out and their mom won't learn. Protect your home, your relationship AND YOUR STEPSON. It'll hit him damn hard if jealous SIL manages to draw a wedge in-between you and your bf. Get her out, now. It'll only get worse.", "Nta, (big) part SIL issue, part partner issue. You two needed to stay on the same page and have lines which she could not cross/ a timeline for her to move that you three were on board with, and she was wildly out of line, especially once she contacted biomom and brought in a BF.", "NTA\n\nBut if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t kick the snake out of your home, then you have a much bigger problem to worry about.", "NTA she needs to leave sit your partner down and lay it all out for them. This was supposed to be your home, together. As it is now, it's SILs home and you just live there. It's not right, and you're not going to live this way anymore. She can leave or you can leave, but life *will not* continue on this way anymore. \n\nAnd then follow through. Even if you just stay with a family member or in a motel/hotel for a few days. Make it clear that you are absolutely serious that this is not going to continue as it has been. Something will change. Your partner can decide what change they prefer to see.", "**I'd start with the fastest thing you can do:  Tell her that her boyfriend and his children are not allowed to visit again.**  Get a box and put anything that belongs to them in it, and escort them out.  If they show up, be prepared to call the police to have them removed; make that plan and know how to implement it.  If you are friends with the neighbors, tell them you have banned her boyfriend and his kids, so they can report it if you aren't home.  You can tell the police his car ID numbers, too, and that he's been banned from the property.  If you suspect she's given her BF a key, change the locks; it might mean changing the locks twice before she's gone, but that's better than him having access.   If they are there when you tell her, get a couple friends to be there to witness and support you.  Or call the police and tell them you have to have someone removed and you need their support when you tell them. \n\n**The second thing to do is to find out what your partner needs to give themselves permission to protect themselves and you from this freeloading user** of a relative that doesn't deserve the name of sister because of how she's been treating you both.  Abusers will claim they are family, but they mean that you 'have to' treat them like family, while they get to treat you like servants and serfs and subjects.  This sister isn't royalty, but she's living off your work and your earnings as if she is.  She obviously has no intention of doing anything different, as long as no one forces her to leave.  It's probable that when told to leave she will be abusive to you both.  Expect this.  She will accuse, blame, pretend she can't find work, try to use her kids as an excuse, etc., but the bottom line is every word she says is aimed at getting her to have a free ride at your expense.  This is about her not taking care of her own responsibilities, but making you responsible.  That's abuse.  I've been there, too.  It's hard to see that what they are doing is wrong, because we care about them, and we don't want to believe they would use us.  They will.  They will use us until we have nothing left to give, and then they will blame us for having nothing left to give them.  They are that selfish.   For us, it was pivotal to realize that we were allowed to put our own needs first, not her wants. \n\nWhen you two give her notice, **as you should,** first **check the laws in your area,** to make sure you are doing it in the legally proscribed way, so you don't end up having to wait another month to get her out.  \n\n**Then, get a lock for your bedroom door.**   Gather up all your valuable stuff, anything and everything, and put it behind that locked door so that while you are gone during the day she's not going to damage your stuff \"accidently\".  There have been angry relatives, and other people, who have taken their revenge on the house and possessions when notified that they will be leaving.  **Whenever you are out of that room, lock the door.  Every time.**  All your account numbers and paperwork should be in there or in a storage unit or other locked place, until she's out.  \n\n**THEN tell her the date she needs to be out on.  Tell her with a written notice,** and keep a copy somewhere safe, like in your car or a bank deposit box, somewhere she can't get it.\n\nAt some point, **maybe halfway into her time left,  put a hold on all the services you pay** **that aren't basics**, like internet and tv services, so these are not available to her.  Or move your tv into your bedroom so you can avoid her at night, or just to protect it from being damaged.  **Change all your passwords**, so that is done before she leaves.  \n\nAnd the day before, or the day of, her move, have a locksmith **change and upgrade the locks** for you and make sure they know that you get all the keys, just you, so you can protect those keys until she's gone.  \n\nOn moving day, **invite over a lot of your friends, to \"come help\".**  This gives you witnesses to help protect you and your home.  And to make sure that your stuff doesn't walk out the door with her.  Also, if they all bring empty boxes, they can pack up her stuff if she still hasn't.  You might have to pay a month of storage somewhere, to get her stuff out of your house.  You might have to pay a night at a hotel for her, to get her out of your house physically.  It's important to not let her push past the eviction date with some excuse.  There are people on therapy subs that tell stories of their freeloader pretending to sick or injured, to force their victim to let them stay longer.  They can do things like this for years.  \n\nVoice of experience.  I had to pack up a relative to get them out. They actually had another place they were living, and I was trying to fix up this place because of their damaging it.  So, we both lived elsewhere, but they had it filled with their hoard. They kept claiming, for over a year, that they would pack up and leave, but all they did in a whole year was go through a couple boxes, give a few things to other people, and put the rest back.  They didn't take out anything, despite the promises.  I finally went and stayed there,  packed it all, put it in outbuildings.  While I was there, they pretended they had left their partner's house, and come back to this damaged place, thinking it would force me to let them stay.   Even then, on the moving day for their furniture, while I had a crew of friends helping,  they were overheard telling someone that they would be back in the house after we left, and they tried with several people to get their bed and other things left in the house, and having those people keep it secret from me.  They didn't know we had the locks changed and were furious when they found out, stole and vandalized and worse.  **Never would have thought they would do such things, but when people feel they are entitled, they will.**  My relative had a choice of places to go.  Yours has limited their choices, but they will handle this, when they realize that they can't victimize the two of you again.", "She can go live with the mom of the stepson since they are so buddy buddy.", "NTA honestly I'd argue you and your BF were Y T A to yourselves and your kid. Honestly, when you offered for her to move in, the agreement should have been that she needed to get a job, apply for benefits, etc within 3 months and that she had a year to move out. That during that year she was responsible financially for X, Y, and Z, as well as cleaning up after her kids and herself (plus any guests that she had.\n\nInstead, you just repeated what your MIL and SFIL did- let her live in your home with no financial responsibilities. She's a single mom- poor her. \n\nMost single mom's have to figure this stuff out. She's lucky in that she has a support system but maybe everyone has supported her too much.", "You need to serve her notice to move out. Give her 3 months so there won\u2019t be any excuses. NTA, you have been too generous for your own good. Sure, your partner might kick up a fuss, but he probably will be relieved once they have all left. And so will all the rest of you.", "NTA - Where are her parents now?  Maybe she should go wherever they are, or with the grandmother who has her other kid.\n\nFamily is not a reasonable excuse to destroy your home and your life.", "Instead of trying to find a new place, she focused on breaking you up so you would move out instead. She is perfectly capable of finding solutions.\n\nGet the snake out of your house. She will find a new person to take advantage of when forced. Snakes always do. NTA", "NTA. Here's an advice. No matter how sad someone's situation is, don't let them move in!", "NTA. I'll be honest, I am not a fan of the whole \"By this day you're out of my house even if you have absolutely nowhere to go approach\". My own father did that to me and I still resent him for it.

That was a Dick move. I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s worked out this long. He must be a saint. But you need to find out how to get them evicted, and do it legally.", "**NTA but your issue is with your partner, not SIL.**\n\nIt's is your partner who's being a very selfish and bad person.", "NTA, obvs. But you don't just have a SIL problem -- you've got a BF problem.

He needs to get on board - just because his sister didn't cause a break up yet doesn't mean she won't keep trying.\n\nThe sister is completely awful. I won't blame her kids (they sound like they're just being kids, and any poor behavior/messes are really the fault of their failed parent). I can't say enough bad things about her behavior, so I won't even try.\n\nIf your boyfriend won't come around and kick her out, it may be necessary for your own wellbeing to get out of this situation on your own. If it comes down to that, check your local laws, you might be able to force him to either buy out your share of the house or sell it altogether so you can get your money out. In any case, do not allow yourself to be removed from the deed until you have been compensated and removed from the mortgage.", "NTA\n\nSIL has had plenty of time to get organised and find a new place\u2026 but of course why would she when she had a free ride with built in babysitter.\n\nYou can\u2019t save the kids from having a rubbish parent, but you can enable the rubbish parent to the point where they stop trying altogether, which is where SIL is currently at. Making her grow up will be good for all of them.", "NTA. Tell your bf it\u2019s either you move out and take all your paycheck with you or she does.

Please give an update when a decision has been made.", "If she doesnt work at all how is she getting money to go out? How could you allow this to go on a year without putting your foot down?

It's been far past due to send her packing!", "NTA.\n\nShe is toxic and a user. You've got to get her out of your home asap. Start whatever process you need to in order to have her evicted. You are not responsible for her children. That's her responsibility, and she's failing at it. That's a HER problem. \n\nIt's been over a year. Honestly, I wouldn't have let them move in the first place. She didn't have a job then, and the in-laws were losing their home to financial difficulties.
