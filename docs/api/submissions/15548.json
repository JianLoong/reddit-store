This includes medical treatments, most especially for allergies. \n\nI kept Benadryl with me throughout the trip as well just in case because some of my other friends have seasonal allergies and Benadryl tends to help them out.

I run into less of these facilities in the South, but I've had a lot of success by advocating with the nursing leadership to get certain units designated latex-free.", "Still, what in the world would you have done if a patient had a latex allergy? My allergy is severe enough that my bare skin brushing against a latex glove will cause *immediate* red patches and severe itching, from just *brushing against* latex. And what would\u2019ve happened if your reaction got more severe? \n\nBecause of your allergy, it\u2019s an ADA issue for them to not be ensuring you have allergy-friendly gloves.
