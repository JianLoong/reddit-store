You did everything you could to prevent her from coming into contact with the cream, and she didn't even know you had it! She sounds pretty toxic to be around IMO.\n\nEdit - OP Says the reaction is mild! \"It makes her eyes water, and she typically has some sneezing/congestion for a brief period after exposure.\"", "NTA. But seems like Jen is. I have a potentially life-threatening allergy. In no way, shape, or form do I expect anyone to cater to my allergy. To whip up drama after the fact for what could have been a minor allergy for her is ridiculous. You went above and beyond in all the precautions you took. If someone did that for me I would be so heart touched and I would thank them profusely.", "NTA.  Jen is mad about something that never happened?  You did everything right, and you might want to cultivate some better friends.", "I can\u2019t judge you on this one because I don\u2019t know enough about allergies to know if she was in any kind of danger but\u2026 ffs, buy yourself an emergency box of gloves. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I admire the fact that you were like my job before my skin but\u2026 Don\u2019t do that to yourself. We need nurses. With skin. ;)", "NAH - You took precautions to keep her safe!", "NTA. Jen was just looking for a reason to be mad", "NTA. It sounds like it was as mild non-life-threatening allergy to your medicine and that you needed the medicine to treat your more serious allergic reaction. And it sounds like you have the training/skill to properly protect your friend.", " NTA- I don\u2019t understand Jen\u2019s logic, if you wanted to ruin her vacation due to the cream, wouldn\u2019t you have exposed her to it? \n\nDue to your due diligence she didn\u2019t even know until after you all were home and someone said something. Her threatening to cut you out of pictures is a really weird reaction.", "Info: how allergic is she to the cream? How serious is her reaction to it? For me it\u2019s the crucial detail that is the difference between the various judgements here.", "NTA - you made sure she wasn't exposed to it at all, so her reaction was over the top...", "NTA. You needed it for a severe allergic reaction you had. You took precautions to protect her AND she never knew about it until after the fact so your precautions worked. Don\u2019t let her anger get to you. Some people just want to be mad", "NTA at all. The sense of entitlement is astounding. As a medical professional it sounds like you took all reasonable accommodations to account for a mild allergy for your friend while still taking care of yourself.", "NTA - That\u2019s silly.  There\u2019s no reason it\u2019s going to get on her or affect her.  It\u2019s not like this is a peanut allergy that will kill her (based on your statement that it\u2019s a mild allergy that just makes her eyes water).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some people deal with fears by trying to control their environment, and that type of person is particularly freaked out when left in the dark/kept ignorant.\n\nBut that's just one possibility. Sounds like you went above and beyond.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ll be the AH and say\u2014for people who are allergic to nuts\u2014the literal world is not nut free\u2014and yet they somehow manage to live among the peanut butter and jelly sandwich eating world. Strangers DGAF if someone near them has a peanut allergy. \n\nYou went out of your way to minimize and avoid contact to that person and they were okay. Had she not been okay, yeah you\u2019d be in the wrong. But given the story, I think you\u2019re fine and this friend sounds like they\u2019re going to die on this hill. And I would let them.\n\nETA: I\u2019m actually also severely allergic to latex and the sight of a balloon stresses me out\u2014but as an adaptive adult I manage and survive even when exposed accidentally. Your friend needs to get over themselves.", "Your work place ran out of gloves? That is a likely an OSHA issue- please report this immediately. \n\nJen, your \"friend\", is clearly making this about herself. NTA.", "NTA. Her reaction was extreme considering nothing happened and it's a mild allergy. I do think you probably should have told her like \"hey I'm gonna be using my cream thing so just don't hug me or anything.\" But your failure to mention it is a far lesser slight than her cutting you out of vacation photos.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say slight YTA only because you were aware of the allergy and didn\u2019t say anything. Yes, her reaction is only mild and you took precautions, but I feel like the polite thing would\u2019ve been to at least keep her aware that you were going to be using this product due to your own severe allergies but would do your best to prevent exposure. \n\nI would reach out to Jen and reiterate your reasons for using the cream, as well as apologize for not informing her and that you had no ill intent. I hope you guys can clear the air soon! :)))", "NTA. You were considerate and she is being a drama queen.", "NTA. Since she didn't have any reactions obviously your sensible precautions worked. If she is willing to cut the friendship for such a silly reason, just let it go.", "NTA. She seems like a narcissist.", "NTA", "What's with her and her Main Character Syndrome? Tell her to get over herself, she didn't react to it at all during the vacation and not everyone is out there to murder her. NTA.", "NTA, but if she has a potentially life-threatening allergy to the ingredient, it would have been safer to let her know so she could better monitor herself for early symptoms, just in case.  If it's that severe, the whole group could have been alerted to be aware, where the epi is, etc.", "So to put this in perspective, this isn\u2019t like a life threatening \u201cif I so much as smell a peanut I\u2019m going to die\u201d type of allergy. It\u2019s like my bell pepper allergy where I despise the smell and my insides will be unhappy if I eat it but I really have no right to be annoyed by anyone eating bell pepper even though I can\u2019t stand the smell of them. It\u2019s not even like my twin brother\u2019s pollen allergy where he spends a quarter of the year unable to breathe through his nose. It\u2019s just a little uncomfortable for your friend and you did everything you needed to to make sure she would not be uncomfortable because you needed to use that particular product to help counter an allergic reaction. Sweetie, there\u2019s not a world in which you\u2019re TA for treating your own allergic reaction. Definite NTA.\n\nDid y\u2019all go to Dollywood while in that neck of the woods? Try out any mountain coasters? Visit Anakeesta? (I have relatives who live nearby Pigeon Forge.)", "NTA. You can tell her to f off. You went out of your way and made a vacation stressful to accommodate her mild shitty symptoms. I have latex allergy and i found out by not so good circumstances when i was 13.(yk school gives out those little rubber things for sex ed) so i know how much more you need that creamy salvation.\n\nYou can explode at her and just say how much of an overreacting capital B she is and move on.", "YTA", "NTA, your friend's reaction after the holiday is very strange. You took every precaution you could in order to not affect her and those precautions were enough that she didn't even realise that an allergen was present. \nIf a friend of mine had done the same as you, I would be singing your praises from the rooftops.", "NTA.  You were using a medication to treat a severe reaction, and you did everything possible to prevent it affecting her-- and were successful!", "NTA\nIt seems like you took a lot of care to keep it away from her. You apparently were not sharing a room.  Jen is being a drama queen.", "Uhm.. I'm a nurse and have never been exposed because we ran out of nitrile gloves. Latex allergy here too. \n\nYour employer sucks. Don't use gloves you're allergic to- keep a box of personal stash and submit for reimbursement. If it's an issue of sterile glove access, swap tasks requiring sterile gloves with a non allergic coworker.", "I always take allergies extremely seriously because I\u2019ve seen the damage they can cause, so I would never downplay her symptoms. Especially not to medications!", "Totally true! Thanks for the reminder to buy an emergency box. \n\nI usually have some but I just transferred from the ER to the ICU for a better schedule, so I wasn\u2019t able to bring my supplies.", "Mild allergy! It makes her eyes water, and she typically has some sneezing/congestion for a brief period after exposure.", "If it were a serious allergy, I wouldn\u2019t even have the cream within a mile radius of her.\n\nI\u2019ve seen hundreds of patients with extreme reactions and I know the damage allergies can do, so I\u2019d never put anyone at risk.", "I do definitely think I could have (and should have) been more communicative in letting her know. \n\nI feared that it would cause a big blow up because she gets touchy when people bring up their allergies, so I didn\u2019t want to make her feel like I was comparing our allergies or taking mine more seriously.\n\nI genuinely just wanted to do what was best for both of us.", "I wouldn\u2019t have even brought the cream if her allergy was even SLIGHTLY more serious than it is, and I had Benadryl and a variety of other meds on me in case she (or anyone else) had any sort of ailment. \n\nI was doing my absolute best to ensure safety!", "We had latex gloves, but the rotation for our non-latex delivery was behind due to supply chain issues and regional shipping delays. \n\nThey came in 2 days late and unfortunately, those 2 days were where my shifts happened to be\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nFortunately, our supervisors are super receptive and made sure to get deliveries scheduled differently so this doesn\u2019t happen in the future.", "I definitely agree that I should\u2019ve communicated with her more clearly. Thank you!", "She didddd get married 4 weeks ago and ONLY posted pictures of herself\ud83d\ude05\n\nThere is slight potential.", "Read the edit, it's not life-threatening.", "Bad at tone indication here. Should I remove or re-edit the edit? I'm not saying you downplayed the symptoms, just that the symptoms are mild", "Talk to employee health. There should never be a time when you\u2019re using something you\u2019re allergic to. They have to provide proper PPE (I know the last couple years have been a shit show with that) and if they don\u2019t, it becomes an unsafe work environment for you. Not to mention a real safety hazard for\nyour pt\u2019s with latex allergies. Your allergy can and will get worse with each exposure. I more or less ignored mine in the beginning, and now I can\u2019t be in the same room as a box of gloves without my face swelling.", "I hope you heal up quick and I read your comments responding to people. NTA I think. It sounds like you took every precaution and were  totally aware of the severity of her allergy. Nurses rock, by the way. You have a good one.", "NTA. She\u2019s being way over the top with her accusations and pettiness, and your allergy is more serious and you needed the cream. I would normally say that it would be best to inform her of it prior to using it, but she probably would have ruined the trip.", "Then I\u2019m voting NTA. You went to great lengths so she wouldn\u2019t be impacted, and she wasn\u2019t. She only got mad when she found out later.  You had to treat your own issue and you did so incredibly carefully. Jen sounds hard work. Who in their right mind would think a friend would do this to intentionally hurt them?? She sounds batshit.", "INFO: did you inform her you would have said cream on you?", "You\u2019re being responsible and considerate here.  I suspect your friend just has a lot of anxiety around this.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real risk to her here, but maybe her anxiety makes it impossible for her to react more rationally.", "They should not have made you work without appropriate gear- it is your right to have safety equipment. Please have this documented somewhere for your own safety.", "I missed that.  Extra NTA, then?", "No, it\u2019s totally okay! I just wanted to make it clear that I still take her seriously!", "I have! \n\nLuckily, it was only 2 shifts that I was without proper gear, and it was because A. I had just transferred units and B. Our shipments come in on rotated schedules and my shifts happened to land in the wrong rotation due to shopping delays.\n\nBut thank you for reminding me, because it is still something I need to keep in mind in case this ever happens again. \n\nAllergies are not fun for anyone and definitely makes it more difficult to properly do my job.", "Thank you very much!", "I definitely think I should explicitly have let her know, but I figured that by mitigating her exposure and making sure that it was contained to just my room, everyone would be taken care of. I also mentioned it in a group text prior to the trip, I just never directly let her know.", "I mentioned in a group text beforehand that I was having an allergic reaction and would be keeping the cream on me, and everyone (including Jen) responded or reacted to the message. \n\nThough, I never explicitly told her so that is my oversight and I could have been more diligent about that.", "Borrow some from med surg. Do anything but use latex gloves you're allergic to. Also, WTF were y'all gonna do if you had a latex allergic patient?\n\nSis, NTA, but your story ain't mathing right for me as a latex allergic nurse.", "INFO: how do you know she\u2019s allergic? If you mentioned said cream wouldn\u2019t she know from the jump you had it?", "I\u2019ve been friends with her for nearly 8 years, so we\u2019ve talked about allergies many times before! \n\nWe\u2019ve also been in situations where we\u2019ve both had to disclose medical information (we\u2019re in med school together and run clinics where we play the role of a patient to demonstrate bedside manner and competency), so it\u2019s been properly diagnosed as well.", "So then I\u2019m confused. If you told them how did she not know? Also why would you try to harm her? Do you have beef? NTA with the limited info. Your friend sounds paranoid.", "Oh so she\u2019s in medical school? I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t have OTC creams or allergy meds handy, especially on group trips! I have contact allergies and I bring my steroid creams everywhere!", "You're a nurse... in med school? \n\nNow I'm extra puzzled.", "There\u2019s absolutely no beef. \n\nIn fact, I was her maid of honor literally 4 exact weeks before this trip. \n\nShe always gets a bit touchy when anyone brings up allergies and it almost becomes a competition of whose are more serious, so I wonder if maybe it made her feel like I wasn\u2019t taking her seriously enough. \n\nBut I would never ever put anyone at risk because I know the serious damage that allergies can cause.", "That surprised me as well. \n\nWe are regularly told by instructors, supervisors, etc. that we should keep everything we\u2019d need in an emergency nearby (at ALL times). This includes medical treatments, most especially for allergies. \n\nI kept Benadryl with me throughout the trip as well just in case because some of my other friends have seasonal allergies and Benadryl tends to help them out. Jen totally could\u2019ve used that had she needed it! \n\nBut still, my guess is that she didn\u2019t register my text message, so that is my mistake for not communicating properly.", "Yeah NTA. This friend sounds exhausting. Good luck!"]}
