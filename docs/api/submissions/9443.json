It's going to be a very small affair with just a handful of people in attendance.

He's under the impression that he's hilarious, quirky and that everyone loves him. He's self employed, so wears shorts and floral shirts... all year round... in the UK! He says he never feels the cold... yet his legs are blue in the Winter and he's always ill. His shorts wearing is his way of displaying what a rebel he is, yet travels everywhere at 5mph below the speed limit!\n\nOver the years we've known each other, he's met 3 of my girlfriends. They've all found him overbearing, childish and offensive, but try to make allowances for him, for my sake. Needless to say, I don't inflict him on them often. He's not perfect - none of us are. I realise he's more like a scared little boy than a grown man and I try to look deeper than a very punchable surface!\n\nHowever... he's always trying to push my buttons to get a reaction. If he can annoy me, he's happy... but he doesn't leave it at that. He will push and push, then get all hurt when I lose my temper. \n\nThe issue - When I told him about the wedding, he said he'd obviously be wearing his shorts. He said to not wear them would be him being told what to do. I think he was joking, trying to get a reaction. The trouble is, I really can't tell. if I say nothing, it's like giving him permission. If I react, he'll keep pushing it and would most likely turn up in his usual attire, just to make a point. He may not, but his desire to be 'individual' is greater than his sense of occasion. \n\nIf I don't invite him, he'll be deeply hurt and it will most likely end the friendship... and for all his faults, he has been there for me during some incredible shit in my life. His 'joke' won't go down well with my Fianc\u00e9 and I really don't want to upset her on our special day.\n\nHe can come to the big event and dress however he wants... but I can't risk him ruining this one.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675861302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ww4h2/aita_for_not_inviting_my_closest_friend_to_my/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have introduced him to at least 3 people who find him deeply unpleasant. Just reading about him, I find him insufferable.

Not to mention on your wife, who deserves to enjoy her wedding without worrying what Phil is going to do next.\n\nUsually it's rude to exclude a close friend from your wedding. But Phil brought this on himself. He can't be trusted to behave appropriately for the occasion. It's a Phil-free wedding for the same reason that some people have child-free weddings: they want an event that won't be disrupted by people who haven't yet developed basic manners.", "INFO. Does your fiance know about his antics, and have expressed she doesn't want him there?", "He will \"obviously be wearing his shorts\"? \n\nI think it would be a kindness not to inflict a dress code on him that made him uncomfortable. When the alternative is to allow a behavior that you feel will rain a bit on your bride's perfect day, the only solution is to not invite him. \n\nSometimes nonconformists get to stay at home.

Its not a demand, but if he would do this one single thing for you as a wedding gift you would appreaciate it very much. And then leave it at that. \n\nYou don't ask him to do something criminal, against his religous beliefs, against his morals or doing temorary or permanent damage to his look, just to wear a pair of big boy pants he can remove as soon he left the building. So you are not asking him for a huge favour. If he still comes in shorts and florals, then at least you know he is not that that much interested in your friendship and you can start going low contact without feeling guilt.

If she feels she will be okay with him, it would probably be a good idea to next sit down with your friend and have a serious heart to heart conversation about your concerns.

Your friend has been the architect of his own downfall, I'm afraid.

He was there for me in bad times when I was younger, and I am thankful for that, but his negative traits have worsened over time to the extent that I just can't overlook them. I now interpret his demanding and inappropriate behaviour as a lack of respect and consideration for me as a person and for the life I have built for myself. I don't want to crush him or fracture our friendship group with some massive blow-out, but I am trying to put some much-needed distance between us. It's not healthy for me to dread his next inappropriate move every time I see him, and it's not healthy for him to have a friend who doesn't enjoy his company.", "NTA  It sounds like an abusive relationship so I would say let him end it.

If so, maybe just write him a letter, explaining why you're not inviting him.  Be honest about how his antics make you feel.  If he really does care about you and this friendship, he'll look at the fact that he's not invited as a chance to change, to start behaving appropriately when the situation demands it.

Is that a real friend?\n\nWould a real friend care more about \"getting a rise\" out of you then trying to ensure your wedding goes off as smoothly as possible?  I dunno - it seems like he might be riding the coattails of things he's done for you in the past.  But friendships need to be maintained.

The options might be dress per dress code or don't come, but tell him the decision is his and you'll miss him greatly if he chooses not to come.  It sounds like it isn't really the shorts, though, it is the overbearing, childish and offensive thing.

Phil might be OP's 'best friend', but OP is Phil's convenient punching bag.  This is nothing near a two-way relationship of friendship and respect."]}
