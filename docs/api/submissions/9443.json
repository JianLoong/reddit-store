It's going to be a very small affair with just a handful of people in attendance. Later in the year, we plan to have a big celebration and will be inviting everyone. \n\nMy closest friend (55m), 'Phil' doesn't know when enough is enough. He's under the impression that he's hilarious, quirky and that everyone loves him. He's self employed, so wears shorts and floral shirts... all year round... in the UK! He says he never feels the cold... yet his legs are blue in the Winter and he's always ill. His shorts wearing is his way of displaying what a rebel he is, yet travels everywhere at 5mph below the speed limit!\n\nOver the years we've known each other, he's met 3 of my girlfriends. They've all found him overbearing, childish and offensive, but try to make allowances for him, for my sake. Needless to say, I don't inflict him on them often. He's not perfect - none of us are. I realise he's more like a scared little boy than a grown man and I try to look deeper than a very punchable surface!\n\nHowever... he's always trying to push my buttons to get a reaction. If he can annoy me, he's happy... but he doesn't leave it at that. He will push and push, then get all hurt when I lose my temper. \n\nThe issue - When I told him about the wedding, he said he'd obviously be wearing his shorts. He said to not wear them would be him being told what to do. I think he was joking, trying to get a reaction. The trouble is, I really can't tell. if I say nothing, it's like giving him permission. If I react, he'll keep pushing it and would most likely turn up in his usual attire, just to make a point. He may not, but his desire to be 'individual' is greater than his sense of occasion. \n\nIf I don't invite him, he'll be deeply hurt and it will most likely end the friendship... and for all his faults, he has been there for me during some incredible shit in my life. His 'joke' won't go down well with my Fianc\u00e9 and I really don't want to upset her on our special day.\n\nHe can come to the big event and dress however he wants... but I can't risk him ruining this one.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1675861302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ww4h2/aita_for_not_inviting_my_closest_friend_to_my/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Time for a Come to Jesus talk. \n\nNTA", "NTA if you don't invite him and to be honest I'd keep him as far away as possible. It's going to come down to choosing between your future wife being hurt and unhappy or your insufferable friend being cheesed off. Your fiance\u00e9 has done nothing to deserve this whereas your friend is a serial offender...it's not really a difficult decision, is it?", "NTA.  You need to tell him point blank, that for the formal ceremony formal attire (or whatever you want) is required.  No leeway, for anyone, and you\u2019re completely serious.  You\u2019re fine if he\u2019d prefer not to attend due to that, and of course he\u2019ll be there for the big party.  But you are firm on this small event.  It\u2019s his choice, pure and simple. And surprises on the day of would result in being escorted out, and the end of the friendship.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to grow up, was he ever invited to any kind of formal event? Did he wear shorts?\n\nIf he can't obey a simple dress code then it's his own fault not getting invited to such events.\n\nAnd if he isn't even willing to put on some appropriate clothes then I doubt he really values your friendship anyway.", "NTA... I would tell him that hes invited to the big celebration as ND you are excited to have him there and he can dress however he likes. \n\nBut he's not going to be invited to the small ceremony as you see it being a much more reserved and conservative event. \n\nFor once in his life he should be able to accept your decision, and no I would not invite him either.", "If his whole vibe in life is to \u201cnot be told what to do\u201d & then don\u2019t tell him. Ask him to be appropriate at your wedding. You say he\u2019s been a good friend & there for you. So ask him to do this for you, as your friend. If he can\u2019t agree to do that, then he can\u2019t attend. The onus is on him, not you. His choice, his consequence. \n\nNTA", "ESH, you don't sound like you like Phil very much. Why claim a best friend you don't like to 'inflict' on others?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding and, whilst I\u2019d let him wear his shorts, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect people to dress a certain way. \n\nI would speak to him about it, find out if he\u2019s joking, and if he isn\u2019t, explain that he\u2019d be doing it for you, as your closest friend, as a wedding day gift, and that you wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t important to you. \n\nIf he still insists, then he\u2019s perhaps even less of a decent friend than you thought.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell him that, since this day is about you and your fianc\u00e9e and you don\u2019t really want any stress around it, you\u2019re going to make things easier on everyone (including him) by unilaterally having him sit this one out. \n\nMy guess is he\u2019ll be horrified and beg to be invited, promising to wear whatever you want. Don\u2019t cave right away if that happens so he know you\u2019re serious, and warn him any funny business will get him ejected.\n\nI know you\u2019ve been friends with him for a long time, but I s past time to set some boundaries. With his personality, no one will judge you, and he can\u2019t afford to alienate one of his few loyal friends.", "NTA. It\u2019s time for some brutal honesty. It might be hard for him to hear but in the long run it could do him some good. He probably drives people away. I think you need to set some solid boundaries like, if he\u2019s coming to the wedding he needs to dress appropriately. It\u2019s a sign of respect to the bride and groom.", "NTA. You have introduced him to at least 3 people who find him deeply unpleasant. Just reading about him, I find him insufferable. Since you enjoy his company nonetheless, no harm in continuing the 1:1 relationship. But if you invite him to the wedding you would be imposing his assholery on other guests. Not to mention on your wife, who deserves to enjoy her wedding without worrying what Phil is going to do next.\n\nUsually it's rude to exclude a close friend from your wedding. But Phil brought this on himself. He can't be trusted to behave appropriately for the occasion. It's a Phil-free wedding for the same reason that some people have child-free weddings: they want an event that won't be disrupted by people who haven't yet developed basic manners.", "INFO. Does your fiance know about his antics, and have expressed she doesn't want him there?", "He will \"obviously be wearing his shorts\"? \n\nI think it would be a kindness not to inflict a dress code on him that made him uncomfortable. When the alternative is to allow a behavior that you feel will rain a bit on your bride's perfect day, the only solution is to not invite him. \n\nSometimes nonconformists get to stay at home. It's the consequence of putting their own comfort over others.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn't want him there and you don't trust him to dress appropriately. You could try to have a serious talk with him and let him know that he needs to follow up dress code if he doesn't agree now he's uninvited. If he shows up on the day not in dress code so you have to throw him out the friendship is over. But honestly someone who you're afraid you'll have to throw out isn't worth inviting.", "ESH - this is definitely a hard one. Have you talked to your fiance about this at all?

I wish you and your fianc\u00e9 the happiest of life.\nI would tell your friend it is an either/or situation! Dress properly or don\u2019t come. He can plan your bachelor party, attend the big event later on , or whatever makes him feel included and satisfied. But the shorts thing at the wedding is an absolute NO. \nI cant stand the hypocrisy of some people ! He wants you to accept him the way he is while he is forcing you to bend your rules to accommodate his!", "NTA- he sounds like a pain so you are NTA for not inviting him but I think you should make an attempt to have a heart to heart with him before you do so. Tell him how much the day means to you and that you wish him to hold off on the shenanigans. If you attack it properly you might be able to get through to him . \n\nAnd if not you know he really doesn\u2019t care about you and you can feel satisfied with your choice to not invite him", "NTA. I\u2019m more baffled why you still have this person in your life if 3 different women have told you he\u2019s no good. Not only should you not invite him if he doesn\u2019t want to grow up, dump him as a friend too and tell him why! (all the reasons you posted).", "Seems a trivial matter to not invite someone and potentially lose a friendship, he must have been to weddings and other formal events before, can you not speak to him about this?", "NTA - I wouldn't invite him to anything much less a wedding. He sounds exhausting.", "Slight YTA. You know how he is. Just ignore it. He\u2019ll be one guy in the whole wedding and most photographers do not take photographs of peoples legs.", "INFO: why would his clothing ruin your wedding?", "Yeah, I agree with this take.  It\u2019s cut and dry.  This friend sounds exhausting.  The kind of person that will just bulldoze you without a second thought is somehow so fragile that any objection on your part will be a friendship ending catastrophe.  You say he has been a good friend, in spite of himself, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he is good for you.", "No it's not. My mind is already made up - I just don't like hurting people.", "That's really it. If he can't dress appropriately or behave appropriately he's not respecting OP or the friendship. His need to be seen to 'do what he wants' is really just deliberately oppositional, and he seems to care more about that than about OP's feelings.", "I was thinking this too...if I had a best friend that would describe me like this to others, I'd drop them. Like has he even had a serious discussion with HIM saying this or does he talk about him like this behind his back, without him knowing that OP feels this way? \n\nMaybe it's best OP does this so that friend knows where he stands. In this case, OP isn't TA but the way he describes his \"best friend\" is.", "I didn't say 'best', I said 'close'. I'm aware of his idiosyncrasies, but I don't expect others to accept them. And you're right, in so many ways, I don't like him, but I think he needs me.", "Unfortunately, he wouldn't give me a straight answer and I really wouldn't know until he turned up on the day.", "P.S. hire security guards and give them photos of Phil. He and his \"no one can tell me what to do\" attitude are not going to sit at home just because you ask him to. His whole identity is built on pride in being defiant, so he won't feel able to let the opportunity pass to show off his essential Phil-ness.", "She knows enough to dislike him. She doesn't know about the shorts issue. She really doesn't want him there, but would allow it for my sake.", "She can't stand him, but would have him there if I really wanted it.", "It sounds like your friend likes the attention his attire brings him. Your wedding is not the time for this.", "You need to be direct with him, then. If it matters to you and your fianc\u00e9e, tiptoeing around the issue isn\u2019t going to cut it.", "NTA. I would however make a last ditch effort and explain to him that if he disrespects your wedding, you will go NC. Also, tell your fiance about everything. She shouldn't be surprised at the ceremony.", "Then I would suggest having a serious sit-down and saying that if he cannot abide by the attire he cannot come and that if he shows up not in that attire then he will need to leave.", "He doesn't understand until I really lose it, so explaining calmly is not an option. He's just not going to be invited. I could eject him on the day, but who needs that drama? He's not going.", "Sound's like a good choice.", "NTA. But he isn't a friend. Someone who pushes and pushes is immature and emotionally abusive.\n\n>and it will most likely end the friendship...\n\nI don't think this is bad at all.", "Tell him straight dress right or don\u2019t come. This your wedding not his.", "NTA - The wedding isn't about him. Be very direct with him that he needs to be dressed appropriately or will be turned away. He can handle being \"told what to do\" and wearing pants for a few hours. Plus, you're in the UK. Aren't you all supposed to love proper etiquette?", "NTA my husbands best man pitched a fit over not being able to wear shorts. Long story short, he wore pants and got to be best man. It\u2019s your wedding. Would he go to a black tie event wearing shorts and get upset and double down when security showed up? Would he meet the royal family in shorts knowing it wasn\u2019t allowed? Your friend sounds exhausting, childish and rude. No wonder he\u2019s self employed. No one else wants to deal with him.", "This is the cutest conflict ever.  Nta and congratulations!", "I had a friend who assumed his Phil would dress appropriately for his wedding dispute threatening to show up in y-fronts and a kimono and tie\u2026 he did. It was a hideous hot pink cheap assed polyester kimono and a very nice silk tie tied as if it were a bow tie. \n\nPhil is a total arse to this day\u2026 20 years later. Speak to him and stand your ground for your Sweetie\u2019s sake. NTA", "NTA I don't think you should not invite him, but you need to have a firm talk with him. You should tell him that if he values your friendship than he will be there and dressed as fitting your dress code. This isn't about authority. This is about doing what he needs to do to share a milestone moment in his friend's life. I'd pay an hour of security to have guests greeted on arrival. If he shows up despite the conversation then he's turned away and you walk away from the friendship.", "nta. maybe it is time to cut  him loose..", "NTA he doesn\u2019t sound like a very good friend. Sure friends joke and tease each other but to annoy someone to the point of them snapping back and then getting offended when you do? I\u2019d rather just drop them tbh", "NTA, but you might suggest that he do a formal version of his usual attire. They make dress shorts.", "Info\n\nWhy are you friends with someone who acts like this? He may have been there for you through dark days, but that doesn\u2019t give him carte Blanche to be obnoxious. And certainly not to upset you bride and make your wedding a spectacle.", "NTA. But you aren\u2019t doing your friend any favors by not telling him when he upsets people. In fact, you validate that behavior. You\u2019re absolutely correct when you say nobody\u2019s perfect, but we\u2019re all supposed to be a work in progress, improving ourselves a little bit by the day. It doesn\u2019t sound like your buddy\u2019s interested in that, consequently he can probably count his friends on one hand.", "NTA many have given you good advice.   Kudos to you for being a friend beyond judgement, he likely has few.   If he values you back as a friend, he will need your requests.   \n\nMaybe provide him with an opportunity to change at the reception or later in the evening.", "Get security for the event if he\u2019s not adhering to your dress code they can escort him out", "This is what I'd do. I'd have a serious discussion before the wedding expressing that I would be deeply hurt if he turns up in some strange outfit just to get attention. \n\nThen, if he does, I'd wait till after the wedding and tell him that this was the last straw. He was warned, and the consequence will be that I'm pulling back from the relationship.", "He hurts you all the time. Consider this.", "It\u2019s either hurt your friend or hurt your fianc\u00e9. I think you know the answer.", "INFO\n\n Is that why he's still your friend because you don't like hurting people?", "He's not getting that chance.", "Once again, I never called him my 'best' friend.", "I mean, you said somewhere else that he doesn't listen to reason, only to you getting angry. He's not much of a friend if he can't do this simple thing for you when you have asked him nicely."]}
