I'm enjoying my child free time that doesn't happen too often. \nLike you don't just randomly show up at someone's door and expect to be allowed to stay.", "And yet there are a few people who say I am lol\nI mean, they're wrong, but they are entitled to their wrong opinion", "I will accept that\n Thank you!", "They also basically tried to break in, no knocking just straight to opening the door", "It doesn't sound as if she had a set of keys if she was banging on the window.", "Return trip must've been awesome \ud83e\udd23", "OP, what is your brother going to do with his wife\u2019s disregard of boundaries and harassment?", "Nope.", "I can\u2019t imagine the absolute mortification of being a friend sitting in the car for 15 mins while my batshit friend harassed her SIL", "And then have to stand around or wait in the car while she knocks on the door for 15 minutes. Can you imagine?", "Assuming the friends didn\u2019t know, it could have backfired stupendously if OP had \u201ccaved\u201d and offered to let the friends spend the one night, but not the SIL. \n\nI\u2019m a special kind of petty.", "She presumed it would be easier to ask forgiveness rather than ask permission.", "In the friends' defense, I wouldn't raise the issue while we were still unwelcome guests on someone's porch. I would abso\u013autely (hello little accent mark, what are you up to?) let them have it, but I wouldn't further disrupt the innocent party's evening.", "Right? some husbands are so wrapped up in their wife's BS the each up their excuses. At least OP's brother knew to ask OP what the actual story was so he could act accordingly.", "Yeah, people often use \u201cantisocial\u201d when what they\u2019re really describing is \u201c*asocial*\u201d. Made that mistake for years, myself.", "It's not bizarre at all. She knew exactly what she was doing, that's why she lied to everyone about it and tried to overpower OP by a surprise visit with a backup of 3 random friends to put her on the spot. Unfortunately for her, since she hasn't bothered to actually get to know OP, OP didn't take her bullshit.", "Because Reddit tends young and childfree, and suggesting that they don\u2019t understand something that parents do pisses them off.", "Same with the three other comments above it.  \n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jlgqn/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_and_her_friends_stay/jkgcndz/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jlgqn/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_and_her_friends_stay/jkgpy55/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jlgqn/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_and_her_friends_stay/jkgrsv2/)"]}
