My way of asking permission is \"yo I'm grabbing everyone and we're coming over this weekend\"... But that's very specific people I know would feel comfortable enough just going, \"lol. Nah can't man. Got stuff that needs doing\"..\n\nI wouldn't show up....anywhere unannounced with a whole gang... \n\nHad I been in ops shoes I'd probably had said, \"fuck it. Come on in. What are we drinking?\" But that's not normal behavior.", "No, OP commented on earlier comment that the friends were told by SIL that OP had invited them all for a girls weekend and didn't know SIL lied to them until OP said \"no\". Later OP Brother called and told OP that one of the friends wanted OP # to apologize and inform her of what happened and what the SIL told them prior to their arrival. \n\nThe friends were upset with SIL after that and it's why SIL cried to Brother because she looked bad and friends are upset with her. All 4 drove 7 hours to OP house. After OP told them 'no' they got a hotel for the night. SIL and 1 friend drove back the 7 hours the following day and the other 2 were so disgusted with SIL that they TOOK A FLIGHT home instead of spending another 7 hours with SIL.", "This exactly!!!"]}
