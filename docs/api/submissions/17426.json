I say \"Without asking  if I wanted company because I don't \" one of her friends says \"You didn't make sure this was ok?\"\nSIL says \"We're family, I don't need to check\" To which I reply \"Oh no you absolutely should have checked because I would have told you NO\"\n\nSIL says \"Well we're here now. So let us in\"\nI say \"No that's ok. I'm not up for company. Especially 4 of you\" SiL says \"But you have  3 guest rooms\" I reply \"No one is daughters room .
