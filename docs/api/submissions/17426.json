You nailed the response. NTA\n\nShe can cash her entitlement check at the nearest hotel.", "Omg NTA. Kid free time is literally priceless! Especially if one happens to be a single parent. It's actually insane to just pop up someone's (family included) house with no permission and with 3 strangers in tow and bags/suitcases like it's a vacation.", "!updateme", "NTA is come to realize this type of behaviour is one of my biggest pet peeve (that term honestly doesn't feel dying enough for my hate). It's like an extreme version of ask for for nor permission. She knew the answer was no but tried to manipulate you by upping the stakes. Then she had the audacity to complain that she had to face the consequences. \n\nIf she didn't want to be embarrassed she shouldn't have set that up as a stake. Maybe next time she shouldn't try to manipulate people.", "WHO DOES THAT???!!!\n\nNTA !!!", "Oh fuck no. I have a similar long weekend coming up, kid free and spouse free and I\u2019m getting stoned and being ALONE for most of it, lmao. If either of my sisters in law showed up (which they wouldn\u2019t because they live 1,000 miles away and aren\u2019t insane) I\u2019d turn them away, too. Or make them smoke a j with me, but still. NTA!", "Okay so NTA!\nMy family, that I love and get along with VERY well know damn well if they knock on my door with no notice there's a 50/50 chance I'll even open the door. IF I do open it there's a 50/50 chance of death occurring because you weren't invited, my door mat say \"roll for initiative\" for a reason.", "NTA! Who just invites themselves and some\nStrangers over???", "NTA . You should have let her and her friends use YOUR home as a holiday home because your FAMILY! How dare you! (SIL thinks the world revolves around her)", "NTA- but now you must double down and bring 10 friends to stay uninvited at her house. It\u2019s only fair especially since she\u2019s being so rude about you putting up reasonable boundaries.", "Im so happy you didn\u2019t let her in. You made my night OP. Enjoy your weekend!!! \n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA. The nerve of that woman.", "NTA. My alone time is sacred, and I wouldn\u2019t have her nearly as nice about it.\nEven if I have a standing invitation to visit, I still call ahead and check that they\u2019re not busy", "NTA That reads as super awkward.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so happy you refused \ud83d\ude06\n\nAlso, all the lies she got caught up in. From her friends asking if she didn't make sure, to her husband asking if she wasn't invited. \n\nI'm glad she got what she deserved because maaaaaan, what an entitled brat. \n\n\"We're family, I don't need to check\" \ud83d\ude02", "You did her friends a favor.  Now they know who she is.", "You definitely already know this but NTA lmao yikes", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Definitely NTA. The audacity! She embarrassed herself and I am so glad you stood up for yourself. Who tf does that? You should send her the link to this so she can read all of the comments, so she can understand that she should apologize. Even her friends knew she was wrong. She embarrassed them, I'm sure. Weird ass behavior. I'm interested in how she's spinning this story to ever remotely sound like she's the victim.", "NTA play stupid games get stupid prizes", "I think it must have been really oddly satisfying when one of the friends said \"you didn't make sure this was ok??\"", "The look on SIL\u2019s face would\u2019ve been priceless after all the bravado infront of her friends!", "She lied to her friends and lied to her husband. Obviously she KNEW she was not invited. Just wow.", "the SIL decided to plan a \"girls trip\" to give this dude \"company\" for the weekend without letting him know? \n\nwhat in the actual hell?", "If I was one of the friends, I\u2019d have dragged her back to the car or whatever sewer she crawled out of, not let her knock on the patio doors for another 15 minutes. How unbelievably embarrassing.", "Narcissists exist, which makes this 100% believable.", "Yeah OP sounds like an ass. Also, they don\u2019t like SIL as much as the others because she \u201cisn\u2019t as social as the rest of us and keeps to herself a lot\u201d but SIL shows up with three friends at OP\u2019s door in a \u201ctouristy area?\u201d Sounds somewhat social to me. Something isn\u2019t jiving here.", "If I was one of those friends I'd have been *furious.* Imagine being basically tricked into imposing on a complete stranger like that!\n\nSIL is beyond rude on so many levels here.", "I feel so bad for the friends, that would be absolutely mortifying.", "Makes me think this isn't the first time SIL has tried to pull something like this.", "Weird odd behaviour from SIL and as a mom I\u2019m sorry your weekend got thrown off by this, I couldn\u2019t imagine having a weekend to myself for it to get thrown off like thisx", "Glad your brother knows you well enough to trust you and to know his wife is \u2026 let\u2019s say is something else.", "  because most parents would understand that sometimes all a parent wants to do when the kid is away is enjoy the resulting peace.", "Your bro knows what\u2019s up hahah", "[removed]", "No kidding! How awful to have a girls weekend planned, think your friend secured a place to stay, and then starts a ton of drama. I would have turned and walked away the second I heard the homeowner say they hadn't known a thing about the arrangements.", "Right, OP should have let the friends stay and not SIL just because they got screwed too lol. That is if she hadn't already had a weekend planned to herself.", "Totally. She tried to bully her way in too by banging on the door for 15 more minutes after he said no. What an awful person.", "I am pretty sure you mean introverted. Antisocial doesn't mean what you think it means.", "NTA. What? Who invites themself and their three closest friends to someone else's house for the weekend without permission? *scratches head*", "Seems like a bot that stole the comment from [G1Gestalt](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jlgqn/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_and_her_friends_stay/jkfr96q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Nah, OP should have recommended a. Affordable place nearby, but she\u2019s not obliged to sacrifice her comfort for their sake, even if it wasn\u2019t the friend\u2019s fault.", "Oh, so she decided that your childfree time was going to be her excuse to get childfree time herself\u2026and didn\u2019t care whether that fit with your plans or not. How\u2026charming?"]}
