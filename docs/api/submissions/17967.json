{"id": 17967, "submission_id": "13pl7wy", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I was upset she missed my graduation because my sister had a baby?", "selftext": "Throwaway account. My (27f) sister (301f) just had her first baby on Sunday morning at 2:30am. It was thankfully a smooth delivery and she and my nephew are happy and healthy. My mom, my dad, me, my sister's husband, and my sister's MIL were all at the hospital (per my sister's request) from around midnight on sunday and the remainder of the day.\n\nWell, my graduation from grad school was on Sunday as well at 4pm. At around 2pm, me and my parents went down to grab lunch from the cafeteria and i realized the time. I asked my parents if they wanted to just meet me at the graduation because I needed to go home and get ready first. My mom looked at me funny and said \"you can't really expect me to leave your sister and my grandbaby right now.\" I didn't know what to say, but my dad just told me to go get ready and they would meet me there.\n\nSo I went to graduation and afterwards I look for my family and sure enough my mom did not come (my dad did!). I was upset because I won an award from my program director and gave a speech in which I thanked her specifically and she missed the whole thing. \n\nI got back to the hospital and didn't really talk to my mom because I didn't want to make a scene or stress out my sister. Last night my mom called me and I expressed to her how hurt I was, and she said I'm being selfish and need to realize my sister just gave birth and that's more important even though she is proud of me. I ended up hanging up.\n\nI guess my thought process is that at the point where it was time to leave, the baby had been born for 12 hours and we spent most of that time with the baby/my sister when they were awake (and I'm glad we did- not complaining). My plan was just to go to graduation and pick up my sisters favorite pizza (she was craving it) on the way back and eat with her. My dad and I did just that and in total my father was away from the hospital for right around 3 hours. \n\nI understand that giving birth is a huge deal and I'm so proud of my sister. I don't mean to act like my graduation was more important. I just feel like there wasn't a need to chose and my mother could have done both because my dad did. My sister had her husband and MIL that would have been with her. I just had my dad and while I'm grateful he came I wish my mom would have too.   \nMy dad agrees with me that my mom should have came, and my sister apologized for \"stealing the spotlight\" to which I told her she had absolutely nothing to be sorry for and to focus on herself and the baby and everything with me and mom would work itself out. I think my mom told my sister which makes me more angry because she doesn't need to worry about this, it's our issue.   \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684839733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pl7wy/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_was_upset_she_missed_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Very wise of you to hang up instead.\n\n12 hrs after the baby was born? All relatives should leave the hospital anyways. The new mum and baby needs to rest, and the new dad can be there if they need something other than the hospital provides.\n\nYou mum should absolutely have gone with your dad to the graduation.\n\nCongratulations on your accomplishment, and the award!", "NTA. Your mom had no reason to skip your graduation. She wasn't needed at the hospital, and the birth had already happened and she met the baby hours and hours before. Your sister likely needed some time to rest anyways. \n\nDon't downplay your accomplishments either! Yes your sister's labor was important but your graduation is extremely important too. Your mom should have been there for you. Your feelings are completely justified. You deserved better.", "NTA, your mom is. After a smooth delivery and already being there for 12(!) Hours, there is no need to stay any longer. Personally, I would have hated it to have so many people around for such a long time, right after giving birth. \n\nCongrats on your graduation though!", "NTA. Your sister had her husband and her mother-in-law and an entire hospital staff with her. Your mom will have the rest of her life time supporting and snuggling on the baby. To pretend she couldn\u2019t leave for a couple hours, as your dad very easily did, is ridiculous.  To call you selfish, and just say you need to realize your sister just gave birth and that\u2019s more important, obviously you were aware that she gave birth you were all there through the night. And calling it more important? If for some reason it was a choice your mom had to make because your sister lived two states away and she can only go to one or the other, that may be a different conundrum. But there was absolutely nothing stopping her from leaving for a couple hours.", "NTA. Your thought process was reasonable, your dad agreed, the baby was born without complications, your sister didn't complain, your mom would have only been gone for three hours, and - most importantly - when you tried to bring up your feelings she shut you down and called you selfish. I'm sorry she let you down. \n\nCongrats on your graduation and award!", "I\u2019m so sorry.  You have the right to be upset. Your mother could have easily gone to your graduation. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019d be seriously pissed as well especially considering that your sister may have liked a bit of time for her and her baby to bond without anyone else there. So your mom could have gone to your graduation for a few hours.", "NTA\n\nHow can a parent fail a child like that?  Your graduation just like your sister's birth are both once in a lifetime events.  Your mother failed you as a parent, because your sister had already given birth and she had time to attend your graduation.\n\nYour mom got exactly what she deserved from you.", "NTA. I agree 100% with your analysis.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is beyond ridiculous. But she's also giving you a heads-up on how things will go forever now. Babies matter more to her than anything, and if your sister wasn't the golden child before, she sure is now. \n\nHonestly, I'm sorry you couldn't change your speech and cut mention of her from it.", "NTA. Unless your sister actually is 301 years old, your mother could've safely attended your graduation and also supported your sister without risk to anyone. Nobody forced them to be competing priorities except your mom. \n\nIf anything, your sister could've probably used some rest and recovery time. Your mom could've viewed the whole weekend as a huge blessing because of both events, but she couldn't help but rank them and then blame you for having feelings about the situation.", "NTA\n\nCongrats on your graduation and award.\n\nYour mum could totally have been there for both her kids that day. Pity she made the choice she did. You have every right to be upset.", "NTA. I understand having a baby is a big deal but your mom could have been there for you. 2 hours is not much and your sister would have been with her husband or other family members for those hours. You have every right to be upset about it", "NTA, your mum could have done both.", "NTA. You have absolutely every right to feel let down and disappointed and even a little angry at your mom. It's not like your sister went into labor or was actively delivering her baby  right before time to get ready for your graduation. Baby was born hours before and your mom absolutely could have gone to watch. Your sister still had plenty of support with her at the hospital. Although I don't know why your sister didn't kick everyone out but her husband. I felt overwhelmed with a lot of people in my room after giving birth and I don't have anxiety. Is your mom planning on being joined at the hip with your sister going home?", "Of course NTA, OP, mom could have done both. I thinks the real sting is that she flat out said that giving birth is more important than graduating. Really, mom? Ugh, that just felt so ick. It would have been just as bad if mom had said something like \"cats and dogs can give birth, it takes a whole lot of time and effort to graduate college,\" and then stayed home Saturday night to be well rested for the graduation. This is just exacerbated by the fact that mom COULD have done both, but chose not to. So sorry, but kudos to you, OP, that is an amazing  accomplishment.", "NTA.  Your mom let you down, and I\u2019m so sorry about that.  No one was in critical condition, so your mom absolutely could have (and should have) left the hospital for a few hours to show up for your graduation.  I\u2019m sorry.", "If your dad could make it, she could make it. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t even leaving your sister alone she still had her other half, and MIL.", "NTA. Your mom could have done both. You weren't being selfish she was. She didn't go because she didn't want to. Your graduation was important too and she could have at least apologized for missing it.", "NTA - Your mom is. It sounds harsh but she doesn't NEED to be around a brand new baby. She isn't going to miss any milestones in a few hours. Your graduation is a one and done thing. Your sister just gave birth, healthy happy baby with no complications and frankly your .om should give her a little space to bond with her baby and to rest and use those hospital resources before she goes home. \n\n100% NTA", "NTA your mom failed you and your disappointment is fully justified. She could easily have attended for the 2 hours. Congratulations on your graduation and the award!", "Nta your mom made a choice to not do both, you have a right to feel things about that.", "NTA \n\nShe could of easily went to your graduation also. She has 2 daughters who accomplished something that day. So I can\u2019t blame you for being a little upset.", "NTA for feeling the way you do but that doesn't mean your mom is an AH either. Just wanna make that clear. \n\nGiving her the benefit of the doubt, she was probably also very exhausted with the birth happening in the middle of the night and this sounds like the first grandchild. Also your mother would've been the only one on your sister's side of the family to be there with her. Having the husband and MIL is great but it doesn't compare to having your own mother there. \n\nIt sucks that it happened on the same day but no one is an AH here. It's okay to feel disappointed but don't make it a big deal.", "YTA. Yes, a daughter's first delivery trumps a graduation.", "NTA for how you feel about the situation overall I totally agree with you. YTA for hanging up on your  mom. Cmon, it's your mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You\u2019ve not had a meltdown about it, you\u2019ve been really calm and explained your disappointment. I also agree she could have left, it was a few hours, not days.

You were right to tell her that and she's absolutely wrong for saying you're selfish.", "NTA, your mom was the one being selfish, she didn't need to stay with your sister, she just wanted the extra time with the baby, who, at this point would not even know who the hell she is. Your sister didn't need her, you did, and she let you down for her own selfish reasons. She owes you an apology.", "Lol, my bad. She's 31! But this is exactly why I am upset. I agree that if push comes to shove and she had to pick she should pick my sister and that was something that was discussed all through the night. But she didn't have to pick and yet she did. It makes me feel like it never mattered to her.", "Even if she was exhausted and excited, there was nothing that required OP's mother to be insulting and rude about OP wanting her to come to her graduation. Especially when OP was giving a speech. \n\nIt could've been very easy to give OP's sister some time to rest and recover twelve hours after giving birth -- my friends who have given birth have all insisted on having some alone time with baby! -- and celebrate both of these major events.", "Her mum is absolutely the AH. While I agree with everything else you said, it was 3 hours away, and ops dad managed it.  In that time, OPs sister could have slept, maybe even spent a little time decompressing, or I don't know having  a shower! (My first shower after delivering was heaven!) She had a baby, both mum and baby are healthy, plus, they had been there for 12 hours by that point. A baby does not trump everything else.
