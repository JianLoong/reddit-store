{"id": 17967, "submission_id": "13pl7wy", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I was upset she missed my graduation because my sister had a baby?", "selftext": "Throwaway account. My (27f) sister (301f) just had her first baby on Sunday morning at 2:30am. It was thankfully a smooth delivery and she and my nephew are happy and healthy. My mom, my dad, me, my sister's husband, and my sister's MIL were all at the hospital (per my sister's request) from around midnight on sunday and the remainder of the day.\n\nWell, my graduation from grad school was on Sunday as well at 4pm. At around 2pm, me and my parents went down to grab lunch from the cafeteria and i realized the time. I asked my parents if they wanted to just meet me at the graduation because I needed to go home and get ready first. My mom looked at me funny and said \"you can't really expect me to leave your sister and my grandbaby right now.\" I didn't know what to say, but my dad just told me to go get ready and they would meet me there.\n\nSo I went to graduation and afterwards I look for my family and sure enough my mom did not come (my dad did!). I was upset because I won an award from my program director and gave a speech in which I thanked her specifically and she missed the whole thing.\n\nI got back to the hospital and didn't really talk to my mom because I didn't want to make a scene or stress out my sister. Last night my mom called me and I expressed to her how hurt I was, and she said I'm being selfish and need to realize my sister just gave birth and that's more important even though she is proud of me. I ended up hanging up.\n\nI guess my thought process is that at the point where it was time to leave, the baby had been born for 12 hours and we spent most of that time with the baby/my sister when they were awake (and I'm glad we did- not complaining). My plan was just to go to graduation and pick up my sisters favorite pizza (she was craving it) on the way back and eat with her. My dad and I did just that and in total my father was away from the hospital for right around 3 hours.\n\nI understand that giving birth is a huge deal and I'm so proud of my sister. I don't mean to act like my graduation was more important. I just feel like there wasn't a need to chose and my mother could have done both because my dad did. My sister had her husband and MIL that would have been with her. I just had my dad and while I'm grateful he came I wish my mom would have too.My dad agrees with me that my mom should have came, and my sister apologized for \"stealing the spotlight\" to which I told her she had absolutely nothing to be sorry for and to focus on herself and the baby and everything with me and mom would work itself out. I think my mom told my sister which makes me more angry because she doesn't need to worry about this, it's our issue.AITA?\n\nETA: I wanted to address a couple things/ answer some questions:\n\n\\- My sister was totally okay with my parents leaving for a few hours, according to my dad. He told me while we were picking up the pizza that my sister told my mom it was fine and to go. I haven't talked to my sister about it because she shouldn't even be thinking about this right now she has enough on her plate. \n\n\\-I understand some people think graduations are stupid, or maybe even childish. If I had just been walking across the stage for a few seconds and that was it this wouldn't really bother me. I was given an award and gave a speech in which I recognized my parents but mainly my mom because I am \"following in her footsteps\" and entering the same field she is in. It was special to me for her to hear me acknowledge her and to see me do that. Maybe that's still stupid to some, but ti wasn't to me.\n\n\\-Lastly, idk about any drama between MIL and our mom. I know husband thinks my mom is nosey, and he might have relayed that to MIL and it might be a thing. But MIL lives far away and so she doesn't come to gatherings or anything that often. I think the last time my mom had any meaningful interaction with her was at my sister's wedding two years ago.

Hours, there is no need to stay any longer. Personally, I would have hated it to have so many people around for such a long time, right after giving birth. \n\nCongrats on your graduation though!", "NTA. Your sister had her husband and her mother-in-law and an entire hospital staff with her. Your mom will have the rest of her life time supporting and snuggling on the baby. To pretend she couldn\u2019t leave for a couple hours, as your dad very easily did, is ridiculous.  To call you selfish, and just say you need to realize your sister just gave birth and that\u2019s more important, obviously you were aware that she gave birth you were all there through the night. And calling it more important? If for some reason it was a choice your mom had to make because your sister lived two states away and she can only go to one or the other, that may be a different conundrum. But there was absolutely nothing stopping her from leaving for a couple hours.", "NTA. Your thought process was reasonable, your dad agreed, the baby was born without complications, your sister didn't complain, your mom would have only been gone for three hours, and - most importantly - when you tried to bring up your feelings she shut you down and called you selfish.

I agree 100% with your analysis.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is beyond ridiculous. But she's also giving you a heads-up on how things will go forever now.

Unless your sister actually is 301 years old, your mother could've safely attended your graduation and also supported your sister without risk to anyone. Nobody forced them to be competing priorities except your mom. \n\nIf anything, your sister could've probably used some rest and recovery time. Your mom could've viewed the whole weekend as a huge blessing because of both events, but she couldn't help but rank them and then blame you for having feelings about the situation.", "NTA\n\nCongrats on your graduation and award.\n\nYour mum could totally have been there for both her kids that day. Pity she made the choice she did. You have every right to be upset.", "NTA. I understand having a baby is a big deal but your mom could have been there for you. 2 hours is not much and your sister would have been with her husband or other family members for those hours. You have every right to be upset about it", "NTA, your mum could have done both.", "NTA. You have absolutely every right to feel let down and disappointed and even a little angry at your mom. It's not like your sister went into labor or was actively delivering her baby  right before time to get ready for your graduation. Baby was born hours before and your mom absolutely could have gone to watch. Your sister still had plenty of support with her at the hospital. Although I don't know why your sister didn't kick everyone out but her husband. I felt overwhelmed with a lot of people in my room after giving birth and I don't have anxiety. Is your mom planning on being joined at the hip with your sister going home?", "Of course NTA, OP, mom could have done both. I thinks the real sting is that she flat out said that giving birth is more important than graduating. Really, mom? Ugh, that just felt so ick. It would have been just as bad if mom had said something like \"cats and dogs can give birth, it takes a whole lot of time and effort to graduate college,\" and then stayed home Saturday night to be well rested for the graduation. This is just exacerbated by the fact that mom COULD have done both, but chose not to. So sorry, but kudos to you, OP, that is an amazing  accomplishment.", "NTA.  Your mom let you down, and I\u2019m so sorry about that.  No one was in critical condition, so your mom absolutely could have (and should have) left the hospital for a few hours to show up for your graduation.

It sounds harsh but she doesn't NEED to be around a brand new baby. She isn't going to miss any milestones in a few hours. Your graduation is a one and done thing. Your sister just gave birth, healthy happy baby with no complications and frankly your .om should give her a little space to bond with her baby and to rest and use those hospital resources before she goes home. \n\n100% NTA", "NTA your mom failed you and your disappointment is fully justified. She could easily have attended for the 2 hours. Congratulations on your graduation and the award!", "Nta your mom made a choice to not do both, you have a right to feel things about that.", "NTA \n\nShe could of easily went to your graduation also. She has 2 daughters who accomplished something that day. So I can\u2019t blame you for being a little upset.", "NTA for feeling the way you do but that doesn't mean your mom is an AH either. Just wanna make that clear. \n\nGiving her the benefit of the doubt, she was probably also very exhausted with the birth happening in the middle of the night and this sounds like the first grandchild. Also your mother would've been the only one on your sister's side of the family to be there with her. Having the husband and MIL is great but it doesn't compare to having your own mother there. \n\nIt sucks that it happened on the same day but no one is an AH here.

Your sister was safe, the baby was safe and healthy, they were in the hospital being monitored by professionals who do this all the time.

I think your mom needs a hobby.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has had a baby: unless there was a medical emergency for mom and/or baby, they will be just fine if Grandma leaves for a couple of hours. In my personal opinion, unless your sister personally wanted your mom to stay with her as much as possible while in the hospital, your mom was being entirely selfish and decided she would rather spend time with her new grandbaby than her daughter who was making a once in a life time achievement. Babies might only be born once, but they have their whole lives to spend time together and bond and coo. You only graduate once. There's no doing it later.\n\nI am very sorry that she did this to you. In my opinion your feelings, and expressing those feelings to the person that caused them, are perfectly reasonable. How do your dad and sister feel about the situation?", "NTA. Your mom had no real need to choose between these big events in her kids\u2019 lives, because they didn\u2019t actually overlap. She was not truly needed at the hospital. Your sister was neither alone nor in any danger, and the big moment had already happened. It was weird for your mom to choose what she did, weird for her to be so flippant about telling you she wasn\u2019t coming, and weird for her to be so dismissive of your feelings about it after the fact. I get the feeling your mom is the type of person who sees a woman talking about how happy she is to have completed a degree or gotten a dream job and tells her, \u201cYou won\u2019t know REAL joy or REAL pride or what it\u2019s REALLY like to be tired until you\u2019re a parent!\u201d \nWeirdest of all for her to call you \u201cselfish\u201d when you personally seem to have prioritized your sister everywhere it was reasonable to do so\u2014staying up all night the night before your graduation to see the birth, and trying to keep her out of the conflict with your mom afterward.\nOP, congratulations on your grad school graduation!

Hopefully someone talks some sense into her or she sees the post and apologizes and treats you to some thing to celebrate you.", "I'm sorry you went through this. NTA. I'm reminded of the time when my sister got engaged. There were endless lunches and congratulations for her, gifts and drinks out. This happened around the time I finished my master's, a grueling program with multiple all-nighters. Getting through that living nightmare was my biggest accomplishment.\n\nNo one in my family acknowledged it. Not even a congratulations. I told my dad years later how much it hurt, which helped a bit.", "NTA, but I\u2019m more here to say this:\n\n*Referring to what you wrote: \n\u201cI understand some people think graduations are stupid, or maybe even childish\u201d*\n\nMy friend, don\u2019t minimize your accomplishments! \nGraduation is a huge thing, and you should be so proud of yourself! I feel like, over the past few years, grads have been labeled so harshly & now it\u2019s like the (unfortunate) norm to call them dumb, or childish, or whatever \u2014 but they\u2019re not.

Let\u2019s guess who is the favorite", "I'll be controversial and say neither of you are really, you are entitled to be upset, she's a grown adult and entitled to set her priorities. Parenting is mostly a team sport and if its important to you and one made it that's pretty decent. \n\nAlso value of such events is relative, for example my parents were really upset that I didn't even go to one of my graduations. It had zero value to me at all and I hate pomp and ceremony, had a horrible experience at undergrad so I didn't even register for it. \n\nSimilarly for grad school I would only have been upset about them not turning up because I was only doing it because they wanted to. If your Mother didn't value it then its kind of annoying, but you are both at this stage adults and she may just have not been feeling well and using it as an excuse. \n\nPlus there's a whole host of baggage with parents you never know, there's often whole reams of drama from previous marriages to miscarriages and all the rest that are part of life but you wouldn't know and might find out sometime in your 30s and 40s that explain why your parents think they way they do.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t understand what these grandparents think they are accomplishing by sitting in the waiting room for 18 hours. \n\nOP - worry about only yourself going forward.

Were they there at your high school and undergraduate graduations?  I didn't even want to go to my grad school graduation.\n\nThis is your mom's first grandchild, right?  Give her some slack.", "Gonna go with NTA on this one. But one caveat, do remember that people go absolutely nuts for grandbabies. It's like they are made of crack cocaine or something. I have never seen my own parents happier than I have since my sister started having kids. So try not to be too hard on her.", "NAH, but I think you also need to see the perspective that your parents love both you and your sister very much, and it feels like they love the both of you equally.  They acted in a way so that at least one of them could be with each of their children on their special day.  Take comfort that you are blessed with a supportive family structure; you were there for your sister even when she had others with her, and your dad was there for you even in the excitement of a newborn grandchild.  And congrats on your graduation, best wishes to you for a happy and bright future!", "NAH. I understand your mom's decision but you are more than entitled to be disappointed and sad.", "YTA.

Very proud of you stranger. \n\nThe ONLY reason I'll give your mom some slack is if she herself either didn't go to graduate school, or even more so, if she didn't pursue higher education.\n\nI find that lots of people who haven't pursued higher education don't realize what a big deal it is to receive a B.A./B.S. or M.A./M.S. or PhD.\n\nIt's like \"it's just more school\" to them. If your mom only graduated high school she's still an asshole, but I'd be a bit more understanding.\n\nHowever if she did go to a university/grad program then I'm going to go with hard asshole.", "NTA. the baby was born, your sister was settled, she had additional support (husband, MIL, and a whole L&D staff) so it's not as if she was alone - your mom could have left for 3 hours to prioritize you. She made a choice.", "NTA.  She could have and should have shown up for your.  I'm sorry.  Congratulations!!", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry that your mom is an asshole. The good news is that you graduated!  Congratulations!", "Your mom is the selfish AH here. She must have some serious main characters and Jim if she thinks that her presence was needed at the hospital 12 hours after the birth. Yes, your sister had a huge accomplishment. But in my opinion, yours was even bigger. People give birth every day, but you worked damn hard for your degree and the fact that you won an award and she wasn't there to see it is bullshit.  \nHow was your sister having already given birth more important than an accomplishment that you worked for YEARS for?  TBH Your sister through that baby together in nine months.  Your mother was the one being selfish, and jealous. She didn't want your sisters MIL to get more time with the new baby than she did. That was all about how your mother felt, and give zero fucks for you.  Has your sister always been my favorite.", "NTA. Having feelings is human, and does not make you selfish. I'd say N-A-H if your mom hadn't been cruel. She's allowed to feel like your sister needed her, and you're allowed to feel hurt. Shame on her for putting your hurt feelings on your sister.", "Nta what was you mom going to do? Breastfeed the baby?", "I've seen this happen before, women in particular go batshit crazy when they have grandkids, especially the first grandchild. I saw this happen with my MIL; as soon as a baby is born in the family she completely drops EVERYONE and just has eyes for the baby, I found it hilarious at first and used to make jokes with my husband about it until I noticed how it really affected the rest of his family.\n\nNTA, but do try to forgive your mom, I'm sure she loves you immensely. It's not OK what she did, but it doesn't make her the worst parent ever.\n\nBy the way, congratulations on your graduation and award, well done!", "NTA, I am a mom. I can understand if it's a high-risk pregnancy and the baby wasn't born yet but the kiddo was already 12 hours old and your sis had other support people available. Your mom absolutely should have been at your graduation.", "NTA. Your mother wasn\u2019t staying at the hospital to support your sister; she stayed because she had baby rabies which the best I can tell is a form of temporary insanity.  Buy your dad a beer for me!", "NTA. Yes, your sister lying on her back getting pregnant is more important than the hard work your put in for 4 years.", "NTA. The baby was born. All was well. She was in the hospital with her spouse and others. Your mother was wrong.", "NTA- Your mom sure is. Sounds like a golden child and a scape goat dynamic. Although your sis is a better person, can't say the same about your mom. You should go on low contact and not let her attitude affect you. \n\nShe showed you who or what her priority was.", "NTA. I\u2019m going to miss having COVID restrictions as an excuse when I have my next kid. That is too many people in the hospital around a newborn baby to begin with. If I was your sister, I\u2019d be mad at your mom too for not attending your graduation and not getting the hell away from me while I\u2019m recovering from birth and bonding with my newborn child. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, your mom failed here.", "NTA, but honestly I wouldn't hold it against your mom too much. I believe she would have been able to attend your graduation, but in the moment she probably felt needed at the hospital even if she wasn't.\n\nCongrats on your graduation and award.", "NTA whatsoever but you mom surely is. I get it, her child has a baby but there\u2019s absolutely no reason she could leave the hospital for a matter of a few hours to attend your graduation. It would if given your sitter time to clean up and rest, and to bind alone with her new baby and husband. Your mom is the one being selfish here! And clearly everyone but here sees it\u2019s! I\u2019m happy your dad game at least, and hopefully the conversation between the two of them is not over! He needs to make his disappointment in your mom known as well. \n\nCongratulations on your graduation and award!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "NTA should have been the most exciting day of her life. He grandchild was born and you graduated. Your feelings are justified", "NTA. I\u2019ve had 3 babies. I\u2019d be livid if my mother missed something important for my siblings AFTER she\u2019d already met the baby. That could cause resentment toward ME or the BABY for absolutely no reason! I wanted to be left alone with my husband and the hospital staff to rest half the time anyway. My Mom was at one of the births and honestly it wasn\u2019t my favorite. It was just so vulnerable and private and I guess I\u2019ve always found my mother a little intrusive so it could be just me. BUT even if I\u2019d wanted her at the birth, if she already made it and had had hours with me and then skipped anyway? That\u2019s awful and creating bad feelings for zero reason. No one but Mom and Dad are that important after baby. Especially not for just 3 hours away. Personally, if I ONLY got 3 hours away from my Mom post baby when I was that tired I\u2019d be ready to personally escort her out of my room and tell her to come back when I\u2019ve had more sleep.", "NTA. I hate to say it but you might have to  get used to not being a priority to your mother. It seems she may have \u201cbaby rabies.\u201d Your mom missed an opportunity to show both of her daughters that they were equally important to her. She also missed the chance to learn to balance all of the family. This is going to be something she is going to have to learn to do. The baby isn\u2019t going anywhere but neither are her other children/family members. I understand you\u2019re hurt, and you have every right to be. Don\u2019t let this taint your achievement. You graduated! Be proud of yourself even if your mom\u2019s head is too clouded to be.", "NTA. She wasn't needed at the hospital and the whole point of a graduation ceremony is to show that the students graduated, whereas unless youre the parent or a doctor, youre sat in the waiting room. She should have reshuffled her priorities. She's TA here, not you.\n\nCongrats btw", "NTA.\n\nMy mum literally went to a funeral 4 hours after I gave birth. I was just happy she made the main event and was more than ok with her going. I would be distancing myself a bit if I were you.", "My heart breaks for you, I\u2019m sorry your mother wasn\u2019t there to celebrate your accomplishments", "NTA  \nYour mom could have spared a couple of hours to attend your graduation and demonstrate her pride in you. Your sister giving birth is not a trump card and it is no more important than your accomplishment. I'm sorry your mom doesn't recognize how unkind her choice really was.", "NTA . I have a PhD and a baby and both are so incredibly important in their own ways. Seems like your mom probably likes to play favorites or has massive baby rabies. Either is not ok for healthy family dynamics.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a smooth delivery and it wouldn't have taken your mother the whole day to just attend your graduation. Besides, like you said, your sister was not going to be left alone. She also had other people to care for her if needed. You yourself even planned with celebrating your own graduation by eating pizza with your sister instead of demanding a grand party or whatever, which I thought was very thoughtful of you. I'd want my mother to attend my younger siblings' graduation too if I was in your sister's shoes. It was also only for a few hours too ffs. Would have been a different opinion if your sister had a rough delivery and it was only your mother, father and you.", "The real question is did the sister that just gave birth kind of she went? Did that sister feel strongly about mom staying? Because if the new mom did not have some kind of emotional hang up about mom leaving than there is absolutely no reason for Mom not to be there at graduation. It doesn\u2019t sound like there was any legitimate reason Mom NEEDED to be at the hospital, there is a chance a recently postpartum sister would WANT mom not to leave, but also it\u2019s just as likely that she would be happy to spend some time with her baby and partner and nobody else, probably sleep for a while. \n\nBut no, you are not the asshole. If sister desperately wanted mom to stay then the situation could be maybe reevaluated, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that is the case at all.", "NTA\n\nYour mom could have stepped away for a couple hours for you.\n\nThe fact that she also dumped that on your sister as if to make herself feel justified in missing it--she likely expected your sister to side with her but she only succeeded in making her feel guilty over your mom's choice.", "NTA you\u2019re 100% right\u2026.and I suspect your mum is just worried about being a less important grandparent if she isn\u2019t there the most. She might be a pushy grandmother too. \n\nReinforce with your sister that you don\u2019t blame her (those hormones mean every little thing becomes a big thing) and that if she isn\u2019t getting enough space to be with her baby at this time then you have her back. \n\nYour mom should never have skipped your graduation, it did both of her kids a disservice.", "NTA\n\nNow you know who your mom\u2019s favorite is. Do what you need to do with that information.", "NTA!\n\nI had a scary premature birth. My eldest turned three a few days later when we were in the NICU. We didn\u2019t ignore our other kid. We left the baby at the hospital, went down the road to a Chuck E Cheese, called some people and had dinner/party/games for a few hours. The husband took kid and all his cool swag home, I did another shift in the NICU. Your sister was fully in the clear. Baby was safe and healthy. Your mom made the wrong call.", "NTA my mom wasn\u2019t even with me at the hospital when I gave birth", "Completely 100% NTA and I\u2019m so so sorry that you\u2019ve been made to feel like you\u2019re being selfish! \n\nIs your mum a stay at home mum with conservative values who thinks women should be in the home or is your sister just the golden child? Because I\u2019m getting the vibe that your education doesn\u2019t mean a lot to her. \n\nI really wish I could give you a hug because the way this is worded makes it obvious that you\u2019re a really kind and caring person. You\u2019ve gone out of your way to make sure your sisters ok and not involved & you seem to almost apologise for your existence with the way this is written. \n\nYour mum really screwed up here and I truly hope this was a once off because she hasn\u2019t slept rather than a pattern of behaviour. \n\nCongrats on graduating OP. You rock!!", "Nta, I don't have kids but the women I've talked to who do generally agree theyd like a few hours with the baby without extra family and hassle hovering around. Childbirth is rough and mamas need some rest and quiet afterwards.", "NTA. Your mom sucks. What did your mom think she was gonna do at the hospital? You should really make it known that she messed up. You thanked her in a speech and she didn't even show up. And when you discuss it with her, she dismisses you. I guess she has a new favorite.", "NTA- your mom behaved incredibly selfishly. There is no reason she needed to still be at the hospital.", "NTA. She had been around/in the same space as her grandbaby for half a day. I'm personally guessing your sister would have appriciated some calm and peace with just her baby and husband within those 12 hours. She could absolutely have dedicated some of those hours to you at that point. If she can tear herself away from hovering over them and leave the room in order to get food, use the bathroom and stretch her legs (which must have happened during those 12 hours), she could have torn herself away in order to celebrate and be there for you as well for some time. Someone should remind her that she isn't the woman that the baby is dependent on and actually needs around 24/7!", "NTA. 12 hours after birth is a long time to spend with a new mother and her child.  I think most people would call it excessive and some hospitals won't even allow it, I know the one my sister gave birth in wouldn't have allowed that many people in that long.  At some point you have to leave to give everyone time to relax.  If anything the graduation was a great excuse to do just that.  \n\nEven better your plan to pick up something your sister really wanted, the pizza, made it a great reason to leave for a bit.  Even without that though there's no reason your mother couldn't have attended your graduation.  Hospital staff are more than equipped to deal with someone giving birth even if that person has no one with them.  Even that wasn't the case since your sister wouldn't have been alone.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a competition but I understand how you feel. For my BS graduation my parents \u201cforgot\u201d. And for my masters graduation my parents \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford to travel\u201d. But that same weekend they went to see my brother across the country. It hurt. My ex in-laws showed up, who hated me and a cousin I\u2019d never met before my graduation. \n\nThey of course went to my brothers only graduation\u2026 from boot camp. \n\nSo I get it. And it sucks hard. I\u2019m so sorry it happened to you and your mom was awful to skip it. \n\nBut you achieved something amazing!  I\u2019m proud of you!", "You are NTA. Graduations are important. And, yes, your sister had a baby, but 12 hours before. Honestly, she probably would have preferred some time to just herself, husband and baby, instead of with all these people. Congratulations, by the way! Great achievement", "I guess I\u2019m a bit biased because my Mom was an AH, but you\u2019re NTA as  I feel like post birth Mom and Dad want some private time and silence with baby. Nothing more annoying than a hovering in-law/mom the nurses are also super helpful! She could afford to lose a few hours she\u2019s got the rest of her life with that baby.", "NTA your mum definitely could have done both.", "NTA - understandably disappointing and hurtful. I would be as well. \n\nAs you have, I would calmly let your mum know that it was hurtful she did not come after all the years of work invested in your  accomplishment, that it feels she did not consider you or show you she is proud of what you have achieved. Please do try to let any resentment go once you've said your piece, for your own sake. Glad your dad and sister, in as much as she was able, both supported you. \nCongratulations on your graduation and becoming an Auntie.", "NTA, it was a big accomplishment for you, and you just wanted to be acknowledged. \n\nHonestly, with today's technology she didn't have to show up, your dad could've video called her so she could see the whole thing from the hospital. \n\nIt's the fact that she completely disregarded you and your accomplishments and then had the audacity to reprimand you all because you wanted to just be acknowledged that makes her the A, and honestly it seems like the rest of your family probably feels she was in the wrong also", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry your mom let you down. She didn\u2019t have a valid reason for missing it. Has she shown a preference for your sister before? Because this is pretty bad on her part. No one *needed her* at the hospital. She just stayed because she wanted to. Again, I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. And her asking for an apology is pretty messed up, as well.", "OP's mother was there because of her own need to feel important. The sister had all the support she needed from her husband. If grandma really wanted to help she would have left and let the new mother sleep and let the parents bond with the baby in peace. The decision to stay was all about herself in my opinion.", "You're not an asshole for telling your mom you were upset. She's not an asshole for missing it to support your sister.\n\nEditing to add, since people are focusing on the fact that the sister didn't NEED her mom there, that even \"uncomplicated\" births can be traumatic. The entire process of suddenly being a parent can be the biggest shock of your life. Yes, lots of people wouldn't want their mom there that whole time but that doesn't mean that it wasn't a welcome presence in this case. And I would argue that a person doesn't NEED their mom at a graduation. \n\nBut to me it's all a moot point-- the mom thought it was more important to stay with her daughter who had just given birth and that upset OP. It's okay to be upset and it's okay (or even good for the relationship) to say something. \n\nNo assholes here.", "NTA. Sure yoyr sister had a baby but graduating is a big deal too! Now is she was actively birthing the baby while your graduation was happening....that would be different. Would you have missed your own graduation for that? Curious. If she was still ACTIVELY in labor would you have left or stayed and missed your ceremony? I feel like then sister would have felt super bad even though she can't help it. \n\nYour mom could have come....sister was fine with it! She had her mom for the hard parts and probably could have used a break. I'm 7 months pregnant now and I expect my mom to leave soon after I birth. She plans to go help around my house while my husband and I are with the baby. \n\nCongratulations to both of you. What a big day!", "NTA, why would she even stay at the hospital? She have her whole life ahead to see this kid and only one chance to spend these 2-3 hours to see her child accomplish something in his life. She is really unreasonable and i wouldnt forgive someone for making my biggest life achievement sound like something worthless, just because she wanted more to watch two people sleep in a hospital bed.", "NTA, and your graduation is more important than the birth of the baby for you, because it is YOUR achievement and YOUR effort, everyone has their priorities, please do not minimize your achievements just to be politically correct, your mother sucks, she did not go to the graduation because he didn't care", "NTA! Your mom should have been there. You just finished GRAD SCHOOL! It\u2019s freaking hard. It\u2019s a journey. You did it! You have a lot to be proud of. Yes, your sister gave birth. Ok. I feel your accomplishment is huge and your mom is completely TA for missing it. You have every right to be hurt. I\u2019m sorry for your pain. Your dad rocks!!!", "NTA if your graduation had been in the middle of her labor, then I would have said you were. Or if she or the baby had had complications and their health was still in jeopardy even after delivery (I bled heavily after giving birth and ended up staying in the hospital for several extra days). But that's not what happened. She had given birth 12 hours earlier. She and the baby were fine. Your sister was even fine with your mom leaving to go to your graduation. So your mom could have been there for both of you. She should have taken the couple of hours to go to your graduation to support and celebrate you too. She was an asshole for refusing to leave your sister.", "NTA, NTA, NTA!!\n\nYour mom is though. I'm a mom, there is NO REASON AT ALL she could not go. She was selfish.\n\nI'm sorry that your memory of your nephew's birth and your graduation are tainted by your mother's inability to grasp she has more than one child.", "NTA - youve got like 12 people (I can't count) hanging out at the hospital 12 hours after birth. And they've been there the whole time?  \n\nThat is excessive- you were right to be upset and your mom is the A H in this one. It is not about birth of a child vs graduation its about Graduation vs THE CHILD IS ALREADY BORN AND YOU'VE SEEN IT FOR HOURS!   \n\nThe child will not remember and will be back tomorrow. And there is a husband as well? I can see if there was no husband so sis would be alone. But still the hospital has nurses, lactation consultants, a nursery, and doctors all over.   \n\nI am sorry your mom decided to suck...", "NTA. There was no need whatsoever for anyone to hang around half the day. Your sister probably didn\u2019t even want them all there for that long. Your mom could have had 2 great events in one day and instead somehow made it all about her. \n\nYou are NOT the selfish one, she is. Shame on her.", "NTA. Your mom had plenty of time to be there for you and chose not to be. She\u2019s the asshole", "NTA\n\nYour sister was fine with her going to your graduation... and perhaps she actually wanted some space.\n\nBut does your mother have a history of either prioritising your sister... or ignoring you?\n\nEven if there is beef with the MIL, your mother wasn't there for her.. she was meant to be there for you.\n\nIf your mother regularly lets you down then she perhaps needs to lose the privilege of knowing everything about your life and/or being a part of it.

She even OKed it. It's like your mom was just too lazy to go and is trying to still be in the \"right\" which is baffling.", "NTA. I'm so sorry.  Congratulations!", "NTA - There's no reason your mother couldn't leave for a few hours for your graduation. In fact, a lot of new moms would appreciate the new grandparents giving them some space. Sounds like your mother is okay smothering one child and casting the other to the side. I'm guessing your sister is a golden child in many other ways.", "NTA.  Is your mom competitive in any way?  She might be seeing herself in competition with your sister's MIL as grandmothers and her thought process was \"There's no way in hell I'm giving that woman an edge on me in spending time with our new grandchild by going to my other daughter's graduation.  OP will understand.\"  She can now brag she didn't leave the hospital once after her grandchild was born even if it was at the expense of her other daughter.", "NTA - your mom clearly has a favorite daughter and is a terrible parent. Honestly go NC with her.", "NTA. The timing was unfortunate, but taking a few hours *after the birth(!)* to attend your graduation was a reasonable expectation. I'm sorry your mom was an AH about this.", "NTA. \nCongratulations on your graduation! That is a tremendous feat. Your education will help you for the rest of your life. \n\nYour mom should\u2019ve made more of an effort. She didn\u2019t. You can\u2019t change the past. Your sister now feels guilty. She shouldn\u2019t. Your dad tried to make up for your mom. You should be grateful for having such a fantastic dad. You can forgive your mom and move on. Don\u2019t let this eat you alive. You have a world to explore and a new baby in the family to dote on. \n\nIf you want to have a little bit of petty revenge, take your dad out for Father\u2019s Day to a secret location and don\u2019t invite anyone to go with the 2 of you. If you have to, do it the day before or after. But make your dad swear to secrecy and do something that is amazing. Your mom will be so curious it will be worth it to see her wonder what happened when she wasn\u2019t there.", "NTA\nCongrats on your graduation she used that accuses cause she didn\u2019t want to come", "NTA. Never undervalue your  achievement's . And It's funny coz, it should've your mom telling you these things, instead she made you feel less & called you selfish. When in fact, she was one being selfish ( and lazy ). I'm sorry kiddo, but your mom's an AH.\n\nAnyway, congratulations on your graduation.", "NTA. If I were in your Mom's shoes I would have missed the graduation if sister was upset and overwhelmed and really wanted me at the hospital, but it sounds like that was not at all the case. Mom probably stayed at the hospital because she prioritized her excitement over the baby. I hope she just wasn't aware of how important the graduation was to you.", "OP you are definitely NTA! Your mom could have gone to the event. Even when you were expressing your hurt feelings she could have apologized, but she chose to double down and turned it around on you to guilt trip you and call you selfish for her own mistakes. Heck, you even chose to get your sister\u2019s favorite pizza and go back to the hospital after your graduation! \n\nCongrats, OP!! I hope you are able to celebrate and be celebrated at a future time by your friends and family members that are supportive of you.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your mom let you down.", "Nta - as someone who graduated university, and has subsequently had three babies; your mom could have easily made both of these. Both are huge life events, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to attend both, especially since the grad was so late in the afternoon. As a mom myself now, I would absolutely attend both.", "Nta your mom could have done both, she chose not to. Also very gently: stop apologizing/softening how you were hurt. How you write it seems like you believe the default is she is right and any of your needs or expectations are extra. They and you are not.

That I could under. But your family had plenty of time to do both....like your dad did. \n\nLuckily,  your sister and you are on the same page.", "It\u2019s sad that mom dismissed her graduation so harshly. Like it wasn\u2019t even a question. Why create a situation from nothing where you state which event is clearly more important at all. Hurtful", "Absolute NTA! I totally agree with this reply!\n\nIt's odd, but is there some competition between her and MIL? That was my first thought. There's no reason that she couldn't nip out for a couple of hours to celebrate your achievements, OP. \n\nAnd congrats on your graduation!", "Yeah I had a baby 5 months ago and definitely did not need visitors at the hospital. Honestly, the only benefit was for the visitors getting to meet the baby and they only stayed for an hour. It was a sacrifice on my part to give up time when I could have been sleeping (or trying to sleep). What a new mother needs in the hospital is rest and relaxation and time to bond with her baby. Oh and food is great, so the pizza from OP was perfect!", "People are never needed at hospital - unless they are doctors there\nIt\u2019s weird for me that people say \u201cI have to be there\u201d while they sit in the waiting room", "Yes and anyway when you have your second, you're alone a lot because others are taking care of your eldest. My husband would go back in forth between being with me and new baby and being with our toddler. I enjoyed the time to myself to recover and bond with baby.", "That whole obsession with grand babies trope is just gag worthy. It\u2019s possessive and unhealthy, I don\u2019t understand why society continues to spout that narrative", "I absolutely agree. It was several hours after the delivery, mother and baby were fine and even had other people around... Sounds like someone found it more important to gush over a newborn that she has plenty of time to gush over afterwards than honouring her daughter\u2018s accomplishments. I would be upset too if I was in OP\u2018s place.", "It was adding insult to injury to call OP selfish. OP was at the hospital all night with her family, and only needed a few hours in the afternoon. Mum's the selfish one, too excited about a grandkid to be reasonable, and now doubling down.", "Someone is the favorite and OP, with her \u201cfollowing in her footsteps\u201d trying hard to get equal attention.", "Also, nobody seems to consider that maybe sister might have wanted a couple of hours peace without the entire family there? Though she requested they be there for the birth, it's now 12 hours on from the birth and she might have just wanted a bit of alone time wit husband and baby. I'm just speculating here but it doesn't sound like mum actually considered what sister wanted regardless. NTA and OP is still incredibly gracious in a hurtful situation, I'm glad she doesn't resent her sister for it, who also sounds very reasonable.", "Not to mention that the sister remained in the hospital with an army of nurses and doctors around her - I don\u2019t know why the mom presumed she absolutely had to be there, too (especially since the sister didn\u2019t ask for it) but if I was OP, I\u2019d be heartbroken. NTA.", "This was my thought too. Is the partner not there for support or something?", ">12 hrs after the baby was born? All relatives should leave the hospital anyways\n\nWhere my partner gave birth they wouldn't even allow all those relatives to still stay there for that long, they're only allowed within visiting hours for a limited time. 12 hours seems pretty excessive, the baby and new parents were probably trying to sleep through most of that time anyway.", "Honestly, what was she doing while the graduation was going on. Staring at the baby? That couldn't have waited two hours? She's got a lifetime to goof off with the baby now. Shame on that woman.", "Yes. I could see for a few hours afterward. But 12? That\u2019s half a day and overkill by any standard. Especially since the mother and child were both doing well.", "Yeah the part about giving birth being more important was the cherry on top for me. It\u2019s giving motherhood is the best thing women can aspire to and the most precious gift they could receive (I never hear this with men and fatherhood). Funny because OP\u2019s mom failed on her mothering that day.", "Right? I don't know what the new mom is feeling but I read this and felt bad for both daughters! I hope everyone is good at setting boundaries for how they are willing to be treated by this new grandmonster", "The hospital only allowed two people at a time in her room. Husband never left her (understandably) so the other 4 of us (me, my parents, and MIL) rotated in and out every 15 minutes or so. If my sister was sleeping we made sure not to disturb her. It never seemed like my sister didn't want us there, and she did call and ask us to come, but after reading the comments i'm wondering if she maybe would have liked some space after the fact and didn't say so.", "Yes. This is the bigger picture: the new grandma values \u201cgRaNdBaBiEs\u201d above all else. Don\u2019t compete for the grandma\u2019s conditional love and support. She\u2019s not even really there for the other sister; *she\u2019s not even really there for the grandbaby*: she\u2019s there to bask in the glow of being Grandma^TM (i.e. an ego-trip).", "I thanked him as well! I just specifically talked about my mother because I'm following in her footsteps career wise so I talked about how watching her in our field as a kid inspired me.", "Honestly, growing up, no she didn't. But ever since my sister got pregnant she has, but I feel like that's understandable and somewhat normal. It hasn't bothered me until now.", "Not needed-and probably not wanted either after the first hour.", "Everyone keeps mentioning husband and MIL were there if the new mom needed anything...wonder if that's the rub. Is there 'conflict' or jealousy between MIL and mom?? Poor OP is probably a casualty of her mom's baby rabies.", "Mom?", "OP is an A because she has feelings?", "It's not a \"beck and call\". How ridiculous. It's an agreed-upon even well in advance, a moment of pride for both parent and child. It's totally reasonable to want to celebrate with people who mean something to you. And while a parent's obligation to provide for you ends at 18, their emotional obligation to you doesn't. They're your family. If you have a good relationship with them it is very reasonable to expect that they would want to be present at moments of pride for you.", "Not that it matters IMO but no she actually hasn't been to my graduations before. I didn't go to my high school graduation because I chose to go on a college visit instead (yes, that was on me i know) and I didn't have a graduation for my BA because of COVID. \n\nShe literally did say the baby was \"more important\" so I don't see how you think she wasn't saying it was less than.

Mom could've done this too.", "Stop it.\n\nGrandma had been at the hospital for 12 hours already and met the grandbaby.  Grandpa went to the graduation and was away from the hospital for THREE HOURS.\n\nShe absolutely could have left the hospital briefly.

There's no reason for her mother to miss the graduation ceremony.", "It quite clearly states in the story that there were no complications and her husband and father of the baby as well as her MIL were still at the hospital.", "OP said in the post that her sister alsonhad her husband and MIL with her at the hospital, so not a single mother, and nothing in the post alludes to a complicated birth.", "I wouldn't have cared so much if I didn't win the award and have a speech. I guess maybe it's stupid but it mattered to me.\n\nI didn't exactly have the time of my life sitting in the waiting room for 12 hours waiting to see my sister for 15 minutes at a time but I did it because I care about my sister and my nephew. I guess to me some things in life we do because they matter to our loved ones even if we aren't having a blast. idk.", "Ok look, just because you couldn\u2019t graduate high school doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is dumb for wanting their parents to be there to celebrate with them.", "Wow you must be a fun person to be around.\n\nJust because you\u2019re salty about graduation ceremonies doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is.

There are too many mothers not worth the name for anyone to be judged for being justifiably hurt and not wanting to be reamed out by the person that hurt them.

I bet the sister wanted mom to leave. I had a baby a few months ago and had family visit for a few hours and that was plenty.

She might have been wrong, but it hardly makes her the worst mother ever.", "I'm sorry but that is pretty ignorant. \n\nI was there every second when my two kids were born and due to covid I wasn't able to be at the hospital when my first grandchild was born and it tore me up.  Just because you don't see any need for family support during childbirth, don't pass judgement on those that need their family there and the family that wants to be there.", "Visitors don't usually just sit in the waiting room. Postpartum, visitors are needed because the nurses just expect you to be able to take care of this tiny little person all by yourself - even if you just spent 36 hours or labor or just had a c section and can't even stand up. It's really helpful to have someone with you who can take care of the baby. However, OP did say that sister's husband was there, so he should've been more than capable of taking care of the baby.

One that comes to mind is when he awoke and groggily tried to ask a nurse what new medication she was administering, and she couldn't tell him what it was or who prescribed it and was ignoring his explicit refusal until our dad stepped in. Turns out she was mistakenly giving him something for a different patient. Another nurse was recording every food item that entered his room on his chart as something he had eaten, when the hospital was arranging for meals that he absolutely could not eat.

You can be very proud of yourself!", "NTA - your mom could have skipped your graduation but could also apologized for it.\nBut she is making you feel guilty for rightfully being pissed. Is your sis a golden child?", "NTA. You specify that you graduated from Grad school. That's a big deal, not saying that any other schooling isn't less of an achievement, but Grad school is something special. Obviously, it meant something for you to want your parents there. With the baby already being born, there really wasn't any reason for your mom to stay with your sister, especially with so many people already there.", "That baby was conceived in 9 months. Assuming it was a PHD, Your degree took you 8 years. I\u2019d be fucking pissed too. Leaving the baby with his mom for 3 hours is not going to do anything, especially when she\u2019s in the hospital. Your mom should have came. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. Has she ever let you down like this before?", "OP, not the AH. A possible take on your mom's failure to attend your graduation. You say you are following in your mom's footsteps, does she alway respond positively when you two talk about your studies/career or is she sometimes negative or condescending? Does she ever come across as jealous that you are doing so well in your studies - winning an award and giving a speech? Did she know that you were going to be presented with this award and still chose not to come? Does your mom take little digs at you that you just tend to blow off? It could also be the old dog being jealous of the young pup stepping out into the world, the world that she has owned for so long. \n\nMy experience with different family members- when I completed my master's degree, my aunt said \"Well if you could get a master's, I certainly can\". I visited her often because I lived nearby and she never expressed such  jealousy or contempt. While I was an undergrad and still living at my mom's, I once asked her to listen to a paper I was finishing up while she was cooking. As I read, she turned and said, \"You wrote that?\" At first I thought she was pleased but later I realized how little she cared or paid attention. I worked nearly full-time in order to pay for school and other expenses, yet I made the Dean's List nearly every quarter. My twin sister, known as the \"smart one\" when we were growing up was straight up snarky with her comments when I started grad school- she was just beginning undergrad at that time while I had worked a few years in management before stepping down to change career paths.  \n\nLong story short, you might think family is in your corner and proud of your successes but some, especially those closest to you might be jealous of your achievements or insecure about theirs. Remember, believe people when they show you who they really are- not by their words but by their actions.  \n\nCongrats OP on your graduation.", "They are both once in a lifetime events(likely) as a parent, and you figure out how to split your time as fairly as possible.

The MIL doesn't get to visit much, and your sister has plenty of ppl who were just as much family as your mom to be there and help your sister. 3 hours was nothing, and I'm so glad your dad went.

As a mom myself I can\u2019t imagine missing your graduation!", "NTA. My sister would probably be pissed at our mom for missing a huge accomplishment like graduation.", "NTA - You both just had amazing things happen and your mother could have very well supported both of you.  Instead, she chose your sister over you.  I would maybe understand her giving priority support to your sister if there were complications, b/c her health and the baby's health should come above a ceremony (In my opinion only), but you've indicated both mom and baby were completely healthy.  I'm glad you were able to have your dad there to support you.  Congratulations on your award btw!", "NTA. At all! Shame on your mom.

Your sister was fine with and i am gonna guess because she wanted alone time for herself, other parent if there is one and alone with with the baby. She your mom could have spared a few hours and you have every right to be hurt by it. Grad school is a big big deal and hard work. You wanted them there to celebrate that with you and thats fair. Its a little weird she is claiming the baby so quickly and refusing to take a hint and give them alone time.

As per the usual, any achievement by a woman besides popping a kid is \"not as important\".\n\nOP, I am so proud of you. What you have done took actual work and dedication, so much effort and time, and actual intellectual labor. I'm sorry your mom privileges a fresh baby that doesn't even know she's there over spending a few hours with her other daughter. Sounds like you can expect this kind of treatment until you give her a grandbaby, and I'm sorry. You are just as important, and your work and achievements are just as important as what your sister has done. \n\nI also think it's worth mentioning that this is likely way more about your mom being self-centered and needing all the attention of being a grandma than it is about your sister's baby. Your sister JUST PUSHED A HUMAN BEING OUT OF HER. Let me tell you how many moms I know who resented the crowding after giving birth: *a lot*. Mom and baby need time to bond and recover, and Grandma is trying to horn in on that and get attention and validation.\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA.

If all of these people: the husband (though he wouldn't count as a visitor), the husband's mom, OP, OP's mom, and OP's dad, that'd be an incredibly crowded room, if it was even allowed.

Sad that she didn\u2019t acknowledge that.", "Sometimes people are needed, when my great-aunt was at the hospital, until I was allowed in, no one took her seriously when she said she was taking morphine or was uncomfortable, so having someone there to advocate for her was very important on her last days.

They can give advice and offer options, but they can't make CHOICES, and these are the kinds of choices few people want to make alone.\n\nYou're kind of prejudiced here because the birth went well, so, in hindsight, it seems like having people there wasn't necessary. But it often doesn't go well. The US maternal mortality rate is the highest in the developed world. I know two people who needed lifesaving emergency procedures while giving birth, one of which could have left the baby with brain damage or made it impossible to have more children, and I don't even know that many people who have given birth. These are big, scary decisions, and no one should be shamed for not wanting to make them alone on 0 hours of sleep while in severe pain.\n\nTo be clear, it sounds like OP's sister was done giving birth, and these concerns were past.

Not just for emotional support, but for basics it's nice to have someone there (and this woman had her husband). I've been inpatient and had my call button ignored when I desperately had to go to the bathroom. I would have wet myself if my mom didn't help me out of bed because the nurse was apparently on extended break and never going to come. Also having someone there to be an advocate and keep an eye on you during labor is helpful too. The medical staff are only actually in the room for a brief period of time. I had to have my spouse yell down the hallway that I was pushing before someone showed up.", "Especially when it's something like having a baby! My first born, I was (just) 19, and I had zero backbone or boundaries when it came to my parenting/bodily autonomy yet. I only WANTED my partner, my sister and my mom there. As well as my midwife obviously. During the birth, my midwife made sure it was just who I asked to be there, but after...it was like a revolving door. I was spread eagle, being sewn up, legs up light shining on all my glory (sorry to be graphic haha), and in marched my step mother, followed by my mother in law, followed by my step sister, followed by my step father....so there I am, in the most intimate moment of my life, very vulnerable etc. and there are 10 PEOPLE IN THE TINY ROOM!!! (Including my new son). I asked my mom to get them out because of how....exposed...I was. And her response was \"oh honey, they don't even notice you, theyre here to see the baby!\" Like, cool??!! Can I maybe see MY baby?? My midwife kept asking people to leave, saying she needed the room quiet and there were way too many people for her to safely make sure I was taken care of. But everyone kept looking to other people to leave because they all though that THEY had more of a right to be there than the others. Finally my sister stepped up and offered to leave (which I didn't want! I WANTED her there, more than ever now!), but she thought she was doing the right thing lol. Once my midwife had a free minute, she went and grabbed my son, handed him to me, asked EVERYONE to leave, had my sister come back in, and told the nurses to STOP LETTING PEOPLE WANDER IN! It was a shit show. When my second was born, I had the same midwife, and we agreed long before I went into labor (even put it in my birth plan) that no one was to be notified until I gave the go ahead, and if they didn't come into the hospital with me, they weren't allowed to enter the room. That sister (having it be her first) very likely just wanted a few hours with her husband and son, but didn't want to hurt mom's feelings...", "They think they\u2019re needed because they have watched too much television.

We were not allowed visitors. But guess what....we had cell phones with video chat??? Our families could see everything that was going on in real time which.... shockingly....wasn't really much!!! Newborns tend to sleep and do jack shit for most of the time. Would it have been nice to have a brief visit? Sure. Was it vital? No. Did it ruin the experience? Absolutely not.

We all rushed to the hospital when we got the news and there was a rotating roster of people at his bedside. But once he was stable and conscious, we were just in the damn way. One or two people I can understand as a support system, but having the extra 9 people was a massive pain in the ass for the staff. FIL is Italian so it's a big family, and loud, and pretty dang annoying if left to their own devices. \n\nI had a dang c-section and was in a private room, but anyone in the room besides my husband meant they were cramped and climbing over each other (and annoying the crap out of me!). It's why I made hubby promise not to tell anyone I was in labor until ***after*** the baby was born and I was ready for visitors, and only my parents were given the info on where we were. Everyone else could wait till we got home. I was tired, in a hospital gown, covered in IVs and grubby. I didn't need visitors then, I needed a shower.

There is love and then there is unhealthy obsession.", "Agreed. My mother was like that and stopped giving a shit about my younger siblings the moment my son came along. She was extremely possessive, to the point where she continually made my husband and I feel like SHE was our son's parent and we were just babysitting HER child for her.

Or was she really critical of you growing up? Did you go into the same field as her because you like it? Was she proud of you when you chose this field? Did she treat your accomplishments as a \u201cgiven\u201d? Did she know you gave a speech and won an award?? Did your sister not tell your mom to go??? Did she realize your graduation was soon? \n\nYou spend so much of the post justifying yourself when you should never have had to. It makes me feel you have been raised to ALWAYS question yourself, and to hold your sister in high regard. Sorry but giving birth isn\u2019t like\u2026that special. I gave birth twice, it\u2019s boring, it\u2019s mundane, and the experience after baby pops out isn\u2019t hard. You are resting and tired, it\u2019s not a time to entertain. Half the female population can figure out how to give birth and not have their mom there 24/7 afterwards but your sister couldn\u2019t?..and since she had a non-complicated birth I actually can\u2019t even understand what your mom OR your sister was even DOING those few hours of your graduation, and why your sister didn\u2019t push your mom out to go. Giving birth doesn\u2019t wipe out your brains or memory, and it\u2019s not as \u201call encompassing\u201d moment as shown on TV. Ya it\u2019s tiring but your sister should have also remembered your graduation to nudge mom to go. \n\nMom 100% should have been there and the fact she didn\u2019t even consider it, scorned the idea, didn\u2019t even discuss options to make it work or tell you in advance, means - like you said - she was never going to go, because it never mattered to her. You should reassess your entire relationship with your mom moving forward. Make sure you live life without trying to impress her. Make yourself happy, that\u2019s it.\n\nI would bet this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done this or downplayed your accomplishments. I would also bet this is somehow about \u201cher\u201d and being in some type of spotlight, and attention grabbing w baby. Sorry your mom chose wrong.", "You did everything asked of you, including being there throughout the night. I mean, Idk what else family is supposed to do in such circumstances but it sounds like everyone but your mom understood the importance of your graduation.\n\nThere were two celebrations that day; yours was equally valid and I hope you know that. Also keep in mind that your dad and your sister both valued your accomplishment and thought it was important, which means they have your back on this and that should be comforting to know that you have family who understand it wasn't an unreasonable expectation. \n\nNTA", "First and foremost, NTA. Secondly, you have every reason to be hurt and to have expressed that hurt, and your mom should have responded better. Full stop. I wanted to get that out of the way before I say what I say next, because I don't want you to misunderstand what I'm about to say. \n\nYour mom made a horrible choice, but I would be willing to bet anything that it's not because it never mattered to her. Your feelings are valid, and I totally understand why it feels that way right now, so please don't think I'm disputing how you feel or taking up for your mom's decision. As I said, it was the wrong one, IMO. She also shouldn't have discounted your feelings or called you selfish for expressing them. \n\nBut I do want to say that, as a mom of an adult daughter myself, I have occasionally made poor choices out of exhaustion/emotional overload/temporary situational blindness that I wish I could go back and change, and not ONE of those decisions reflects how much I care for my daughter or how important she is to me. We're moms, but we're humans first. There could be any number of (bad reasons, but stil) reasons why she felt it necessary to be there. As others have said, maybe there's some dynamic between her and the MIL of which none of us are aware. Maybe she just had a bad feeling. Or maybe she was overcome and overwhelmed with the emotion of the situation and got caught up in it on top of being exhausted.\n\nYes, you and your dad were also exhausted, I'm sure, but everyone's body/brain handles each unique situation differently. \n\nObviously, the fact that there was a discussion about what decision would be made if push came to shove meant that she cared. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been a discussion. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is not to cut your mom some slack or to let her off the hook, but to hopefully help YOU understand that this decision was not a reflection of how much she cares for YOU or your graduation. It says more about her and her state of mind at the time in the midst of an extremely emotional and overwhelming experience, and her initial reaction to you again says more about her state of mind in the moment than it does about her feelings in general. She likely feels guilty, and is unwilling to admit that, even to herself yet, so she lashed out at you and called you selfish when in reality, she likely feels like the selfish one.\n\nAnd I could be way off. I don't know your mom or the dynamics between you, but I'd be willing to bet that since she featured in your speech that she was a huge influence on you and your road to graduation. I'd be willing to bet that she has been there for you other times when it counted. I'd be willing to bet that she absolutely does care. She's just blinded by emotional overload right now. And while it's no excuse, it is an explanation. One that I hope may give you some peace, not in a way that you don't feel hurt about her decision or her actions (or her reaction to your reaction) but in a way that you can *consider* (at least just consider) that this one awful scenario doesn't reflect her overall care for you as her daughter or her pride in you for having made it this far. \n\nNo doubt she owes you an apology. No doubt she made a series of hurtful and wrong decisions. But at the end of the day, we all do. We ALL make decisions based on the emotions of the moment we're in. And both of these were huge moments for all of you. Sometimes we make the wrong one and it takes some time to see it. But it doesn't *always* reflect on how much our loved ones truly matter to us, but instead reflects our emotional capacity at any given moment when experiencing something that's unbearably overwhelming. \n\nAnyway, I hope that helps provide you with a little bit of comfort, or at the very least, a train of thought that can eventually lead you to some peace about the situation. \n\nCongratulations on your graduation. Above all else, you deserve that recognition.", "This. My wife specifically asked for no one to visit until we were home. It's not at all fun to have to entertain family at the hospital will you have nurses poking and prodding, no sleep, figuring out breast feeding, etc. COVID was a great time to have kids because there was a natural excuse for the family to not come to the hospital.  \n\nHaving the husband there while the family went to the graduation should have been enough. Grandma is overly involved.", "That\u2019s absolutely what I wanted after having both my kids. If you are awake overnight for labor you will be sleep deprived on top of the physical trauma of labor. I fed my kids and once they were settled sent them back to the nursery so I could take a nap. I sent my husband home to nap and shower. Unless you\u2019re asked to be at the hospital, let the woman who just expelled a baby have some rest!", "I\u2019m surprised Sis didn\u2019t kick mom out to get her to go to the graduation.

How pointless, tiring, and frankly laughably ridiculous. Is it always this dramatic in your house?", "I feel like 3-4 hours post birth I would start yelling about getting everyone away from be besides my other half. I don\u2019t need people ooing and ahhing while poking at my newborn for hours upon hours that sounds fucking annoying\n\nMaybe that\u2019s just me though \ud83d\ude02", "Absolutely. The first time I got to be totally alone with my newborn was one of the most special moments of my life and I still think about it often.", "You may be following in your mother\u2019s steps career wise, but I hope you take a long hard look at your dad and follow him as a person. As a parent, he found a way to be with both of his daughters for their important milestones. His actions are a shining example of who you\u2019d want to be as a person, and parent if you chose to be one.", "Listen, I don't suppose there's much comfort in being appreciated by strangers on the internet over your own mother but I believe that was a worthwhile and honourable thing to do even if she wasn't there to see it.\n\n100% NTA and my unsolicited haphazard guess is this: if your mother is otherwise a decent, supportive parent to you, then this big double life event probably made her feel helpless and terrified that her daughters are 'grown', resulting in some fairly primal and irrational urge to cleave to something as helpless as she feels (your nephew) that 'needs' her and  makes her feel less redundant as a mother. I suspect she truly is deeply proud of you both and believe she'll eventually realise that she has been silly. Your dad sounds great btw. All the best to all of you.", "Wow, that makes her sitting it out even worse! I\u2019m so sorry. But major congratulations on your graduate degree!", "Wow that sucks. SorryOP.  For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m proud of you!", "There\u2019s just no way. Sorry for doubting. If she was fair and normal the rest of your upbringing, why didn\u2019t she react normally at least to your request? Screaming at you about being selfish makes her seem honestly unhinged. Maybe this was a her that was hiding the entire time, but putting birth and a baby on a pedestal to THIS degree indicates something ain\u2019t normal in mom\u2019s head. \n\nChildbirth is magical and grandkids are amazing and blahblah cliche, but \u2026they\u2019re also quite routine occurrences. If your mom is like this day 1 of baby\u2019s life I can\u2019t imagine how over bearing and controlling she will become later. Poor husband.", "It\u2019s very normal to be happy and excited about your grandkids but it\u2019s not normal to tell your other kids that they no longer matter. I\u2019m so sorry that happened but proud of you for getting your grad degree! That\u2019s not easy!", "nta, is it possible you mom had traumatic births? I only say this because my mom did. And almost died with one of my brothers. When I was pregnant with the first grandbaby, my mom wasn\u2019t baby obsessed but obsessed with my health. And leading up to birth & for the first day or two after she was a nervous wreck. Constantly by my side making sure I was ok. Is it possible she was genuinely concerned for your sisters health or reliving some of the trauma she might have gone through? And behaved irrationally?", "Not normal, nor understandable. You matter too, OP. And if she could support one daughter through a life changing milestones through 9 while months, she could\u2019ve easily supported you for your life changing milestone (that\u2019s taken years of work) for a few hours. Please hear me - your sister having a child doesn\u2019t mean you or what\u2019s going on with you matter any less.

Not even too late", "AHs don't apologise though.", "And like, being selfish isn\u2019t always bad! It\u2019s ok to focus on yourself, your own feelings, and your own needs sometimes.", "I had a baby pre-COVID and I insisted on no visitors in the hospital. We actually ended up relaxing this rule, because I stayed in hospital longer than expected, my wife desperately needed some time at home to do laundry, etc., and I needed someone to watch our son while I got a few hours of rest. \n\nI'll go into the next one with the same rules, with the obvious exception of my son and whoever is looking after him.", "I had my son via emergency c-section after his heart rate plummeted about an hour after I was induced. Within an hour, my in-laws, parents, aunt (with 3 of my cousins and 3 of their kids), and my sister and BIL (the only people I wanted there other than my parents and parents in law) were at the hospital and in my room for HOURS. I was trying to figure out breastfeeding and had 5 women in my room telling me how I was doing it wrong, and when the nurse noticed I was almost in tears, she kicked everyone out. Something my husband and I had been trying to do for 2 hours. \n\nWhen I had my daughter, the only person who came the day of was my MIL, who worked at the hospital and was watching my son, and it was glorious.

Her other daughter needed her too.", "Well, my spouse was nervous, exhausted and completely useless during the whole childbirth. Not his fault, just how it was.", "Exactly! By 12 hours, you can totally accept a few hours to yourself, especially for an equally monumental life event. Like both things are important and sometime you\u2019ve gotta disappoint a kid, but the baby is out and stable.", "Hell even in the US this can be the case. Some nurses are genuinely bothered by you asking them to do their job.", "But do you need your Mom, Dad, Mil, sister and your partner beside you all at the same time, all day?!?", "My daughter was in ICU for 30 days at a Level 1 Trauma Center and they almost killed her more than once. Like you, I am not exaggerating when I tell you that if I had not been there, she would be dead. I was also amazed at the number of people who were in ICU when she was that had no visitors. It was very sad. I literally only left once a day to shower.", "She literally has her husband and mil there. A new mom does not need a room full of people her entire stay. She needs to rest and bond with baby.", "I definitely ***did not*** want my family there. We didn't tell anyone out kiddo was on the way until AFTER he was born and I had some time to rest. I think it was a full 8 hours between when he was born and when my parents arrived. They were the only ones we invited to the hospital. Everyone else could wait until I wasn't in a hospital gown with a damn catheter in. Lol", "Yes I'm sure she was exhausted but she just has to sit there and watch her daughter graduate. She obviously knew the graduation was happening so why didn't she go home and take a nap after the baby was born?", "It could also be less baby vs school accomplishments and more a golden child vs black sheep situation. Either way it sucks and I\u2019m sorry for op. She could and should have been there for you.", "I really, really wish we wouldn\u2019t keep perpetuating the myth that women\u2019s only purpose and best life accomplishment is to give birth.

It's frustrating when medical staff hands the patient all that info when they're very clearly not firing on all mental cylinders, but they're OK to discharge, so off they go. They're usually not in a state to think clearly, so it's the job of the person handling documentation to ask questions, note the answers, and make sure they have contact info for any follow up questions.", "But all of these examples are people who are definitely NEEDED, not just there to \"show support\".

That\u2019s a very general statement and Id say it\u2019s wrong. Obviously OP is NTA. But I wouldn\u2019t go so far to say that mom and baby are the only ones who need to be there.

It was one of the worst weeks of my life.I really needed someone else to be there. Childbirth is no joke.", "That's definitely a good point \u2010 I left out emotional examples I had because I was more focused on pointing out why people are NEEDED even if they're not doctors, but you're right to bring up that sometimes they're needed simply because they're wanted or they're there for emotional support. \n\nTo piggyback on your example:\nWhen I got into a serious accident, my mom was there for me but I asked for my grandmother because she was my comfort, and she held my hand when I was scared.  \nWhen I was younger and getting glasses, my mom came into the exam room with me just so I wouldn't feel alone and vulnerable, being unable to see.  \nWhen I first got blood drawn for testing, my grandmother wasn't in sight but she was just around the corner so I could talk to her and focus on her because by gosh I hate needles.  \nWhen I broke my finger (as an adult) my grandmother came with me to the hospital and stayed until I was through the doors, and then went to a nearby parking lot (fuck you covid) and waited for me. Knowing she was less than 5 minutes away was a huge comfort in spite of the fact that I don't *need* her there.  \n\nPeople are important, and with the Covid restrictions on who has been allowed into even just the waiting rooms, you see a lot of stories about people suffering mentally and emotionally because they're alone. Support is one of the biggest things, in my opinion, to healing, because it helps in so many ways, not all of them physical.", "It drives me nuts when people give advice tailored to a specific situation but frame it as a general rule that applies to every situation.", "That's even harder because my husband was running between taking care of our oldest and trying to help me.
