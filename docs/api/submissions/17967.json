{"id": 17967, "submission_id": "13pl7wy", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I was upset she missed my graduation because my sister had a baby?", "selftext": "Throwaway account. My (27f) sister (301f) just had her first baby on Sunday morning at 2:30am. It was thankfully a smooth delivery and she and my nephew are happy and healthy. My mom, my dad, me, my sister's husband, and my sister's MIL were all at the hospital (per my sister's request) from around midnight on sunday and the remainder of the day.\n\nWell, my graduation from grad school was on Sunday as well at 4pm. At around 2pm, me and my parents went down to grab lunch from the cafeteria and i realized the time. I asked my parents if they wanted to just meet me at the graduation because I needed to go home and get ready first. My mom looked at me funny and said \"you can't really expect me to leave your sister and my grandbaby right now.\" I didn't know what to say, but my dad just told me to go get ready and they would meet me there.\n\nSo I went to graduation and afterwards I look for my family and sure enough my mom did not come (my dad did!). I was upset because I won an award from my program director and gave a speech in which I thanked her specifically and she missed the whole thing.\n\nI got back to the hospital and didn't really talk to my mom because I didn't want to make a scene or stress out my sister. Last night my mom called me and I expressed to her how hurt I was, and she said I'm being selfish and need to realize my sister just gave birth and that's more important even though she is proud of me. I ended up hanging up.\n\nI guess my thought process is that at the point where it was time to leave, the baby had been born for 12 hours and we spent most of that time with the baby/my sister when they were awake (and I'm glad we did- not complaining). My plan was just to go to graduation and pick up my sisters favorite pizza (she was craving it) on the way back and eat with her. My dad and I did just that and in total my father was away from the hospital for right around 3 hours.\n\nI understand that giving birth is a huge deal and I'm so proud of my sister. I don't mean to act like my graduation was more important. I just feel like there wasn't a need to chose and my mother could have done both because my dad did. My sister had her husband and MIL that would have been with her. I just had my dad and while I'm grateful he came I wish my mom would have too.My dad agrees with me that my mom should have came, and my sister apologized for \"stealing the spotlight\" to which I told her she had absolutely nothing to be sorry for and to focus on herself and the baby and everything with me and mom would work itself out. I think my mom told my sister which makes me more angry because she doesn't need to worry about this, it's our issue.AITA?\n\nETA: I wanted to address a couple things/ answer some questions:\n\n\\- My sister was totally okay with my parents leaving for a few hours, according to my dad. He told me while we were picking up the pizza that my sister told my mom it was fine and to go. I haven't talked to my sister about it because she shouldn't even be thinking about this right now she has enough on her plate. \n\n\\-I understand some people think graduations are stupid, or maybe even childish. If I had just been walking across the stage for a few seconds and that was it this wouldn't really bother me. I was given an award and gave a speech in which I recognized my parents but mainly my mom because I am \"following in her footsteps\" and entering the same field she is in. It was special to me for her to hear me acknowledge her and to see me do that. Maybe that's still stupid to some, but ti wasn't to me.\n\n\\-Lastly, idk about any drama between MIL and our mom. I know husband thinks my mom is nosey, and he might have relayed that to MIL and it might be a thing. But MIL lives far away and so she doesn't come to gatherings or anything that often. I think the last time my mom had any meaningful interaction with her was at my sister's wedding two years ago.

Hours, there is no need to stay any longer. Personally, I would have hated it to have so many people around for such a long time, right after giving birth. \n\nCongrats on your graduation though!", "NTA. Your sister had her husband and her mother-in-law and an entire hospital staff with her. Your mom will have the rest of her life time supporting and snuggling on the baby. To pretend she couldn\u2019t leave for a couple hours, as your dad very easily did, is ridiculous.  To call you selfish, and just say you need to realize your sister just gave birth and that\u2019s more important, obviously you were aware that she gave birth you were all there through the night. And calling it more important? If for some reason it was a choice your mom had to make because your sister lived two states away and she can only go to one or the other, that may be a different conundrum. But there was absolutely nothing stopping her from leaving for a couple hours.", "NTA. Your thought process was reasonable, your dad agreed, the baby was born without complications, your sister didn't complain, your mom would have only been gone for three hours, and - most importantly - when you tried to bring up your feelings she shut you down and called you selfish.

I agree 100% with your analysis.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is beyond ridiculous. But she's also giving you a heads-up on how things will go forever now. Babies matter more to her than anything, and if your sister wasn't the golden child before, she sure is now. \n\nHonestly, I'm sorry you couldn't change your speech and cut mention of her from it.", "NTA. Unless your sister actually is 301 years old, your mother could've safely attended your graduation and also supported your sister without risk to anyone. Nobody forced them to be competing priorities except your mom. \n\nIf anything, your sister could've probably used some rest and recovery time. Your mom could've viewed the whole weekend as a huge blessing because of both events, but she couldn't help but rank them and then blame you for having feelings about the situation.", "NTA\n\nCongrats on your graduation and award.\n\nYour mum could totally have been there for both her kids that day. Pity she made the choice she did. You have every right to be upset.", "NTA. I understand having a baby is a big deal but your mom could have been there for you. 2 hours is not much and your sister would have been with her husband or other family members for those hours. You have every right to be upset about it", "NTA, your mum could have done both.", "NTA. You have absolutely every right to feel let down and disappointed and even a little angry at your mom. It's not like your sister went into labor or was actively delivering her baby  right before time to get ready for your graduation. Baby was born hours before and your mom absolutely could have gone to watch. Your sister still had plenty of support with her at the hospital. Although I don't know why your sister didn't kick everyone out but her husband. I felt overwhelmed with a lot of people in my room after giving birth and I don't have anxiety. Is your mom planning on being joined at the hip with your sister going home?", "Of course NTA, OP, mom could have done both. I thinks the real sting is that she flat out said that giving birth is more important than graduating. Really, mom? Ugh, that just felt so ick. It would have been just as bad if mom had said something like \"cats and dogs can give birth, it takes a whole lot of time and effort to graduate college,\" and then stayed home Saturday night to be well rested for the graduation. This is just exacerbated by the fact that mom COULD have done both, but chose not to. So sorry, but kudos to you, OP, that is an amazing  accomplishment.", "NTA.  Your mom let you down, and I\u2019m so sorry about that.  No one was in critical condition, so your mom absolutely could have (and should have) left the hospital for a few hours to show up for your graduation.

It sounds harsh but she doesn't NEED to be around a brand new baby. She isn't going to miss any milestones in a few hours. Your graduation is a one and done thing. Your sister just gave birth, healthy happy baby with no complications and frankly your .om should give her a little space to bond with her baby and to rest and use those hospital resources before she goes home. \n\n100% NTA", "NTA your mom failed you and your disappointment is fully justified. She could easily have attended for the 2 hours. Congratulations on your graduation and the award!", "Nta your mom made a choice to not do both, you have a right to feel things about that.", "NTA \n\nShe could of easily went to your graduation also. She has 2 daughters who accomplished something that day. So I can\u2019t blame you for being a little upset.", "NTA for feeling the way you do but that doesn't mean your mom is an AH either. Just wanna make that clear. \n\nGiving her the benefit of the doubt, she was probably also very exhausted with the birth happening in the middle of the night and this sounds like the first grandchild. Also your mother would've been the only one on your sister's side of the family to be there with her. Having the husband and MIL is great but it doesn't compare to having your own mother there. \n\nIt sucks that it happened on the same day but no one is an AH here.

I think your mom needs a hobby.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has had a baby: unless there was a medical emergency for mom and/or baby, they will be just fine if Grandma leaves for a couple of hours. In my personal opinion, unless your sister personally wanted your mom to stay with her as much as possible while in the hospital, your mom was being entirely selfish and decided she would rather spend time with her new grandbaby than her daughter who was making a once in a life time achievement. Babies might only be born once, but they have their whole lives to spend time together and bond and coo. You only graduate once. There's no doing it later.\n\nI am very sorry that she did this to you. In my opinion your feelings, and expressing those feelings to the person that caused them, are perfectly reasonable. How do your dad and sister feel about the situation?", "NTA. Your mom had no real need to choose between these big events in her kids\u2019 lives, because they didn\u2019t actually overlap. She was not truly needed at the hospital. Your sister was neither alone nor in any danger, and the big moment had already happened. It was weird for your mom to choose what she did, weird for her to be so flippant about telling you she wasn\u2019t coming, and weird for her to be so dismissive of your feelings about it after the fact. I get the feeling your mom is the type of person who sees a woman talking about how happy she is to have completed a degree or gotten a dream job and tells her, \u201cYou won\u2019t know REAL joy or REAL pride or what it\u2019s REALLY like to be tired until you\u2019re a parent!\u201d \nWeirdest of all for her to call you \u201cselfish\u201d when you personally seem to have prioritized your sister everywhere it was reasonable to do so\u2014staying up all night the night before your graduation to see the birth, and trying to keep her out of the conflict with your mom afterward.\nOP, congratulations on your grad school graduation!

Hopefully someone talks some sense into her or she sees the post and apologizes and treats you to some thing to celebrate you.", "I'm sorry you went through this. NTA. I'm reminded of the time when my sister got engaged. There were endless lunches and congratulations for her, gifts and drinks out. This happened around the time I finished my master's, a grueling program with multiple all-nighters.

Let\u2019s guess who is the favorite", "I'll be controversial and say neither of you are really, you are entitled to be upset, she's a grown adult and entitled to set her priorities. Parenting is mostly a team sport and if its important to you and one made it that's pretty decent. \n\nAlso value of such events is relative, for example my parents were really upset that I didn't even go to one of my graduations. It had zero value to me at all and I hate pomp and ceremony, had a horrible experience at undergrad so I didn't even register for it. \n\nSimilarly for grad school I would only have been upset about them not turning up because I was only doing it because they wanted to. If your Mother didn't value it then its kind of annoying, but you are both at this stage adults and she may just have not been feeling well and using it as an excuse. \n\nPlus there's a whole host of baggage with parents you never know, there's often whole reams of drama from previous marriages to miscarriages and all the rest that are part of life but you wouldn't know and might find out sometime in your 30s and 40s that explain why your parents think they way they do.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t understand what these grandparents think they are accomplishing by sitting in the waiting room for 18 hours. \n\nOP - worry about only yourself going forward.

Give her some slack.", "Gonna go with NTA on this one. But one caveat, do remember that people go absolutely nuts for grandbabies. It's like they are made of crack cocaine or something. I have never seen my own parents happier than I have since my sister started having kids. So try not to be too hard on her.", "NAH, but I think you also need to see the perspective that your parents love both you and your sister very much, and it feels like they love the both of you equally.  They acted in a way so that at least one of them could be with each of their children on their special day.  Take comfort that you are blessed with a supportive family structure; you were there for your sister even when she had others with her, and your dad was there for you even in the excitement of a newborn grandchild.

Very proud of you stranger. \n\nThe ONLY reason I'll give your mom some slack is if she herself either didn't go to graduate school, or even more so, if she didn't pursue higher education.\n\nI find that lots of people who haven't pursued higher education don't realize what a big deal it is to receive a B.A./B.S. or M.A./M.S. or PhD.\n\nIt's like \"it's just more school\" to them. If your mom only graduated high school she's still an asshole, but I'd be a bit more understanding.\n\nHowever if she did go to a university/grad program then I'm going to go with hard asshole.", "NTA. the baby was born, your sister was settled, she had additional support (husband, MIL, and a whole L&D staff) so it's not as if she was alone - your mom could have left for 3 hours to prioritize you. She made a choice.", "NTA.  She could have and should have shown up for your.  I'm sorry.  Congratulations!!", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry that your mom is an asshole. The good news is that you graduated!  Congratulations!", "Your mom is the selfish AH here. She must have some serious main characters and Jim if she thinks that her presence was needed at the hospital 12 hours after the birth. Yes, your sister had a huge accomplishment. But in my opinion, yours was even bigger. People give birth every day, but you worked damn hard for your degree and the fact that you won an award and she wasn't there to see it is bullshit.  \nHow was your sister having already given birth more important than an accomplishment that you worked for YEARS for?  TBH Your sister through that baby together in nine months.  Your mother was the one being selfish, and jealous. She didn't want your sisters MIL to get more time with the new baby than she did. That was all about how your mother felt, and give zero fucks for you.  Has your sister always been my favorite.", "NTA. Having feelings is human, and does not make you selfish. I'd say N-A-H if your mom hadn't been cruel. She's allowed to feel like your sister needed her, and you're allowed to feel hurt. Shame on her for putting your hurt feelings on your sister.", "Nta what was you mom going to do? Breastfeed the baby?", "I've seen this happen before, women in particular go batshit crazy when they have grandkids, especially the first grandchild. I saw this happen with my MIL; as soon as a baby is born in the family she completely drops EVERYONE and just has eyes for the baby, I found it hilarious at first and used to make jokes with my husband about it until I noticed how it really affected the rest of his family.\n\nNTA, but do try to forgive your mom, I'm sure she loves you immensely. It's not OK what she did, but it doesn't make her the worst parent ever.\n\nBy the way, congratulations on your graduation and award, well done!", "NTA, I am a mom. I can understand if it's a high-risk pregnancy and the baby wasn't born yet but the kiddo was already 12 hours old and your sis had other support people available. Your mom absolutely should have been at your graduation.", "NTA. Your mother wasn\u2019t staying at the hospital to support your sister; she stayed because she had baby rabies which the best I can tell is a form of temporary insanity.  Buy your dad a beer for me!", "NTA. Yes, your sister laying on her back getting pregnant is more important than the hard work your put in for 4 years.", "NTA. The baby was born. All was well. She was in the hospital with her spouse and others. Your mother was wrong.", "NTA- Your mom sure is. Sounds like a golden child and a scape goat dynamic. Although your sis is a better person, can't say the same about your mom. You should go on low contact and not let her attitude affect you. \n\nShe showed you who or what her priority was.", "NTA. I\u2019m going to miss having COVID restrictions as an excuse when I have my next kid. That is too many people in the hospital around a newborn baby to begin with. If I was your sister, I\u2019d be mad at your mom too for not attending your graduation and not getting the hell away from me while I\u2019m recovering from birth and bonding with my newborn child. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, your mom failed here.", "NTA, but honestly I wouldn't hold it against your mom too much. I believe she would have been able to attend your graduation, but in the moment she probably felt needed at the hospital even if she wasn't.\n\nCongrats on your graduation and award.", "NTA whatsoever but you mom surely is. I get it, her child has a baby but there\u2019s absolutely no reason she could leave the hospital for a matter of a few hours to attend your graduation. It would if given your sitter time to clean up and rest, and to bind alone with her new baby and husband. Your mom is the one being selfish here! And clearly everyone but here sees it\u2019s! I\u2019m happy your dad game at least, and hopefully the conversation between the two of them is not over! He needs to make his disappointment in your mom known as well. \n\nCongratulations on your graduation and award!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "NTA should have been the most exciting day of her life. He grandchild was born and you graduated. Your feelings are justified", "NTA. I\u2019ve had 3 babies. I\u2019d be livid if my mother missed something important for my siblings AFTER she\u2019d already met the baby. That could cause resentment toward ME or the BABY for absolutely no reason! I wanted to be left alone with my husband and the hospital staff to rest half the time anyway. My Mom was at one of the births and honestly it wasn\u2019t my favorite. It was just so vulnerable and private and I guess I\u2019ve always found my mother a little intrusive so it could be just me. BUT even if I\u2019d wanted her at the birth, if she already made it and had had hours with me and then skipped anyway? That\u2019s awful and creating bad feelings for zero reason. No one but Mom and Dad are that important after baby. Especially not for just 3 hours away. Personally, if I ONLY got 3 hours away from my Mom post baby when I was that tired I\u2019d be ready to personally escort her out of my room and tell her to come back when I\u2019ve had more sleep.", "NTA. I hate to say it but you might have to  get used to not being a priority to your mother. It seems she may have \u201cbaby rabies.\u201d Your mom missed an opportunity to show both of her daughters that they were equally important to her. She also missed the chance to learn to balance all of the family. This is going to be something she is going to have to learn to do. The baby isn\u2019t going anywhere but neither are her other children/family members. I understand you\u2019re hurt, and you have every right to be. Don\u2019t let this taint your achievement. You graduated! Be proud of yourself even if your mom\u2019s head is too clouded to be.", "NTA. She wasn't needed at the hospital and the whole point of a graduation ceremony is to show that the students graduated, whereas unless youre the parent or a doctor, youre sat in the waiting room. She should have reshuffled her priorities. She's TA here, not you.\n\nCongrats btw", "NTA.\n\nMy mum literally went to a funeral 4 hours after I gave birth. I was just happy she made the main event and was more than ok with her going. I would be distancing myself a bit if I were you.", "My heart breaks for you, I\u2019m sorry your mother wasn\u2019t there to celebrate your accomplishments", "NTA  \nYour mom could have spared a couple of hours to attend your graduation and demonstrate her pride in you. Your sister giving birth is not a trump card and it is no more important than your accomplishment. I'm sorry your mom doesn't recognize how unkind her choice really was.", "NTA . I have a PhD and a baby and both are so incredibly important in their own ways. Seems like your mom probably likes to play favorites or has massive baby rabies. Either is not ok for healthy family dynamics.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a smooth delivery and it wouldn't have taken your mother the whole day to just attend your graduation. Besides, like you said, your sister was not going to be left alone. She also had other people to care for her if needed. You yourself even planned with celebrating your own graduation by eating pizza with your sister instead of demanding a grand party or whatever, which I thought was very thoughtful of you. I'd want my mother to attend my younger siblings' graduation too if I was in your sister's shoes. It was also only for a few hours too ffs. Would have been a different opinion if your sister had a rough delivery and it was only your mother, father and you.", "The real question is did the sister that just gave birth kind of she went? Did that sister feel strongly about mom staying? Because if the new mom did not have some kind of emotional hang up about mom leaving than there is absolutely no reason for Mom not to be there at graduation. It doesn\u2019t sound like there was any legitimate reason Mom NEEDED to be at the hospital, there is a chance a recently postpartum sister would WANT mom not to leave, but also it\u2019s just as likely that she would be happy to spend some time with her baby and partner and nobody else, probably sleep for a while. \n\nBut no, you are not the asshole. If sister desperately wanted mom to stay then the situation could be maybe reevaluated, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that is the case at all.", "NTA\n\nYour mom could have stepped away for a couple hours for you.\n\nThe fact that she also dumped that on your sister as if to make herself feel justified in missing it--she likely expected your sister to side with her but she only succeeded in making her feel guilty over your mom's choice.", "NTA you\u2019re 100% right\u2026.and I suspect your mum is just worried about being a less important grandparent if she isn\u2019t there the most. She might be a pushy grandmother too. \n\nReinforce with your sister that you don\u2019t blame her (those hormones mean every little thing becomes a big thing) and that if she isn\u2019t getting enough space to be with her baby at this time then you have her back. \n\nYour mom should never have skipped your graduation, it did both of her kids a disservice.", "NTA\n\nNow you know who your mom\u2019s favorite is. Do what you need to do with that information.", "NTA!\n\nI had a scary premature birth. My eldest turned three a few days later when we were in the NICU. We didn\u2019t ignore our other kid. We left the baby at the hospital, went down the road to a Chuck E Cheese, called some people and had dinner/party/games for a few hours. The husband took kid and all his cool swag home, I did another shift in the NICU. Your sister was fully in the clear. Baby was safe and healthy. Your mom made the wrong call.", "NTA my mom wasn\u2019t even with me at the hospital when I gave birth", "Completely 100% NTA and I\u2019m so so sorry that you\u2019ve been made to feel like you\u2019re being selfish! \n\nIs your mum a stay at home mum with conservative values who thinks women should be in the home or is your sister just the golden child? Because I\u2019m getting the vibe that your education doesn\u2019t mean a lot to her. \n\nI really wish I could give you a hug because the way this is worded makes it obvious that you\u2019re a really kind and caring person. You\u2019ve gone out of your way to make sure your sisters ok and not involved & you seem to almost apologise for your existence with the way this is written. \n\nYour mum really screwed up here and I truly hope this was a once off because she hasn\u2019t slept rather than a pattern of behaviour. \n\nCongrats on graduating OP. You rock!!", "Nta, I don't have kids but the women I've talked to who do generally agree theyd like a few hours with the baby without extra family and hassle hovering around. Childbirth is rough and mamas need some rest and quiet afterwards.", "NTA. Your mom sucks. What did your mom think she was gonna do at the hospital? You should really make it known that she messed up. You thanked her in a speech and she didn't even show up. And when you discuss it with her, she dismisses you. I guess she has a new favorite.", "NTA- your mom behaved incredibly selfishly. There is no reason she needed to still be at the hospital.", "NTA. She had been around/in the same space as her grandbaby for half a day. I'm personally guessing your sister would have appriciated some calm and peace with just her baby and husband within those 12 hours. She could absolutely have dedicated some of those hours to you at that point. If she can tear herself away from hovering over them and leave the room in order to get food, use the bathroom and stretch her legs (which must have happened during those 12 hours), she could have torn herself away in order to celebrate and be there for you as well for some time. Someone should remind her that she isn't the woman that the baby is dependent on and actually needs around 24/7!", "NTA. 12 hours after birth is a long time to spend with a new mother and her child.  I think most people would call it excessive and some hospitals won't even allow it, I know the one my sister gave birth in wouldn't have allowed that many people in that long.  At some point you have to leave to give everyone time to relax.  If anything the graduation was a great excuse to do just that.  \n\nEven better your plan to pick up something your sister really wanted, the pizza, made it a great reason to leave for a bit.  Even without that though there's no reason your mother couldn't have attended your graduation.  Hospital staff are more than equipped to deal with someone giving birth even if that person has no one with them.  Even that wasn't the case since your sister wouldn't have been alone.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a competition but I understand how you feel. For my BS graduation my parents \u201cforgot\u201d. And for my masters graduation my parents \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford to travel\u201d. But that same weekend they went to see my brother across the country. It hurt. My ex in-laws showed up, who hated me and a cousin I\u2019d never met before my graduation. \n\nThey of course went to my brothers only graduation\u2026 from boot camp. \n\nSo I get it. And it sucks hard. I\u2019m so sorry it happened to you and your mom was awful to skip it. \n\nBut you achieved something amazing!  I\u2019m proud of you!", "You are NTA. Graduations are important. And, yes, your sister had a baby, but 12 hours before. Honestly, she probably would have preferred some time to just herself, husband and baby, instead of with all these people. Congratulations, by the way! Great achievement", "I guess I\u2019m a bit biased because my Mom was an AH, but you\u2019re NTA as  I feel like post birth Mom and Dad want some private time and silence with baby. Nothing more annoying than a hovering in-law/mom the nurses are also super helpful! She could afford to lose a few hours she\u2019s got the rest of her life with that baby.", "NTA your mum definitely could have done both.", "NTA - understandably disappointing and hurtful. I would be as well. \n\nAs you have, I would calmly let your mum know that it was hurtful she did not come after all the years of work invested in your  accomplishment, that it feels she did not consider you or show you she is proud of what you have achieved. Please do try to let any resentment go once you've said your piece, for your own sake. Glad your dad and sister, in as much as she was able, both supported you. \nCongratulations on your graduation and becoming an Auntie.", "NTA, it was a big accomplishment for you, and you just wanted to be acknowledged. \n\nHonestly, with today's technology she didn't have to show up, your dad could've video called her so she could see the whole thing from the hospital. \n\nIt's the fact that she completely disregarded you and your accomplishments and then had the audacity to reprimand you all because you wanted to just be acknowledged that makes her the A, and honestly it seems like the rest of your family probably feels she was in the wrong also", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry your mom let you down. She didn\u2019t have a valid reason for missing it. Has she shown a preference for your sister before? Because this is pretty bad on her part. No one *needed her* at the hospital. She just stayed because she wanted to. Again, I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. And her asking for an apology is pretty messed up, as well.", "OP's mother was there because of her own need to feel important. The sister had all the support she needed from her husband. If grandma really wanted to help she would have left and let the new mother sleep and let the parents bond with the baby in peace. The decision to stay was all about herself in my opinion.", "You're not an asshole for telling your mom you were upset. She's not an asshole for missing it to support your sister.\n\nEditing to add, since people are focusing on the fact that the sister didn't NEED her mom there, that even \"uncomplicated\" births can be traumatic. The entire process of suddenly being a parent can be the biggest shock of your life. Yes, lots of people wouldn't want their mom there that whole time but that doesn't mean that it wasn't a welcome presence in this case. And I would argue that a person doesn't NEED their mom at a graduation. \n\nBut to me it's all a moot point-- the mom thought it was more important to stay with her daughter who had just given birth and that upset OP. It's okay to be upset and it's okay (or even good for the relationship) to say something. \n\nNo assholes here.", "NTA. Sure yoyr sister had a baby but graduating is a big deal too! Now is she was actively birthing the baby while your graduation was happening....that would be different. Would you have missed your own graduation for that? Curious. If she was still ACTIVELY in labor would you have left or stayed and missed your ceremony? I feel like then sister would have felt super bad even though she can't help it. \n\nYour mom could have come....sister was fine with it! She had her mom for the hard parts and probably could have used a break. I'm 7 months pregnant now and I expect my mom to leave soon after I birth. She plans to go help around my house while my husband and I are with the baby. \n\nCongratulations to both of you. What a big day!", "NTA, why would she even stay at the hospital? She have her whole life ahead to see this kid and only one chance to spend these 2-3 hours to see her child accomplish something in his life. She is really unreasonable and i wouldnt forgive someone for making my biggest life achievement sound like something worthless, just because she wanted more to watch two people sleep in a hospital bed.", "NTA, and your graduation is more important than the birth of the baby for you, because it is YOUR achievement and YOUR effort, everyone has their priorities, please do not minimize your achievements just to be politically correct, your mother sucks, she did not go to the graduation because he didn't care", "NTA! Your mom should have been there. You just finished GRAD SCHOOL! It\u2019s freaking hard. It\u2019s a journey. You did it! You have a lot to be proud of. Yes, your sister gave birth. Ok. I feel your accomplishment is huge and your mom is completely TA for missing it. You have every right to be hurt. I\u2019m sorry for your pain. Your dad rocks!!!", "NTA if your graduation had been in the middle of her labor, then I would have said you were. Or if she or the baby had had complications and their health was still in jeopardy even after delivery (I bled heavily after giving birth and ended up staying in the hospital for several extra days). But that's not what happened. She had given birth 12 hours earlier. She and the baby were fine. Your sister was even fine with your mom leaving to go to your graduation. So your mom could have been there for both of you. She should have taken the couple of hours to go to your graduation to support and celebrate you too. She was an asshole for refusing to leave your sister.", "NTA, NTA, NTA!!\n\nYour mom is though. I'm a mom, there is NO REASON AT ALL she could not go. She was selfish.\n\nI'm sorry that your memory of your nephew's birth and your graduation are tainted by your mother's inability to grasp she has more than one child.", "NTA - youve got like 12 people (I can't count) hanging out at the hospital 12 hours after birth. And they've been there the whole time?  \n\nThat is excessive- you were right to be upset and your mom is the A H in this one. It is not about birth of a child vs graduation its about Graduation vs THE CHILD IS ALREADY BORN AND YOU'VE SEEN IT FOR HOURS!   \n\nThe child will not remember and will be back tomorrow. And there is a husband as well? I can see if there was no husband so sis would be alone. But still the hospital has nurses, lactation consultants, a nursery, and doctors all over.   \n\nI am sorry your mom decided to suck...", "NTA. There was no need whatsoever for anyone to hang around half the day. Your sister probably didn\u2019t even want them all there for that long. Your mom could have had 2 great events in one day and instead somehow made it all about her. \n\nYou are NOT the selfish one, she is. Shame on her.", "NTA. Your mom had plenty of time to be there for you and chose not to be. She\u2019s the asshole", "NTA\n\nYour sister was fine with her going to your graduation... and perhaps she actually wanted some space.\n\nBut does your mother have a history of either prioritising your sister... or ignoring you?\n\nEven if there is beef with the MIL, your mother wasn't there for her.. she was meant to be there for you.\n\nIf your mother regularly lets you down then she perhaps needs to lose the privilege of knowing everything about your life and/or being a part of it.

She even OKed it. It's like your mom was just too lazy to go and is trying to still be in the \"right\" which is baffling.", "NTA. I'm so sorry.  Congratulations!", "NTA - There's no reason your mother couldn't leave for a few hours for your graduation. In fact, a lot of new moms would appreciate the new grandparents giving them some space. Sounds like your mother is okay smothering one child and casting the other to the side. I'm guessing your sister is a golden child in many other ways.", "NTA.  Is your mom competitive in any way?  She might be seeing herself in competition with your sister's MIL as grandmothers and her thought process was \"There's no way in hell I'm giving that woman an edge on me in spending time with our new grandchild by going to my other daughter's graduation.  OP will understand.\"  She can now brag she didn't leave the hospital once after her grandchild was born even if it was at the expense of her other daughter.", "NTA - your mom clearly has a favorite daughter and is a terrible parent. Honestly go NC with her.", "NTA. The timing was unfortunate, but taking a few hours *after the birth(!)* to attend your graduation was a reasonable expectation. I'm sorry your mom was an AH about this.", "NTA. \nCongratulations on your graduation! That is a tremendous feat. Your education will help you for the rest of your life. \n\nYour mom should\u2019ve made more of an effort. She didn\u2019t. You can\u2019t change the past. Your sister now feels guilty. She shouldn\u2019t. Your dad tried to make up for your mom. You should be grateful for having such a fantastic dad. You can forgive your mom and move on. Don\u2019t let this eat you alive. You have a world to explore and a new baby in the family to dote on. \n\nIf you want to have a little bit of petty revenge, take your dad out for Father\u2019s Day to a secret location and don\u2019t invite anyone to go with the 2 of you. If you have to, do it the day before or after. But make your dad swear to secrecy and do something that is amazing. Your mom will be so curious it will be worth it to see her wonder what happened when she wasn\u2019t there.", "NTA\nCongrats on your graduation she used that accuses cause she didn\u2019t want to come", "NTA. Never undervalue your  achievement's . And It's funny coz, it should've your mom telling you these things, instead she made you feel less & called you selfish. When in fact, she was one being selfish ( and lazy ). I'm sorry kiddo, but your mom's an AH.\n\nAnyway, congratulations on your graduation.", "NTA. If I were in your Mom's shoes I would have missed the graduation if sister was upset and overwhelmed and really wanted me at the hospital, but it sounds like that was not at all the case. Mom probably stayed at the hospital because she prioritized her excitement over the baby. I hope she just wasn't aware of how important the graduation was to you.", "OP you are definitely NTA! Your mom could have gone to the event. Even when you were expressing your hurt feelings she could have apologized, but she chose to double down and turned it around on you to guilt trip you and call you selfish for her own mistakes. Heck, you even chose to get your sister\u2019s favorite pizza and go back to the hospital after your graduation! \n\nCongrats, OP!! I hope you are able to celebrate and be celebrated at a future time by your friends and family members that are supportive of you.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your mom let you down.", "Nta - as someone who graduated university, and has subsequently had three babies; your mom could have easily made both of these. Both are huge life events, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to attend both, especially since the grad was so late in the afternoon. As a mom myself now, I would absolutely attend both.", "Nta your mom could have done both, she chose not to. Also very gently: stop apologizing/softening how you were hurt. How you write it seems like you believe the default is she is right and any of your needs or expectations are extra. They and you are not.

That I could under. But your family had plenty of time to do both....like your dad did. \n\nLuckily,  your sister and you are on the same page.", "It\u2019s sad that mom dismissed her graduation so harshly. Like it wasn\u2019t even a question. Why create a situation from nothing where you state which event is clearly more important at all. Hurtful", "Absolute NTA! I totally agree with this reply!\n\nIt's odd, but is there some competition between her and MIL? That was my first thought. There's no reason that she couldn't nip out for a couple of hours to celebrate your achievements, OP. \n\nAnd congrats on your graduation!", "Yeah I had a baby 5 months ago and definitely did not need visitors at the hospital. Honestly, the only benefit was for the visitors getting to meet the baby and they only stayed for an hour. It was a sacrifice on my part to give up time when I could have been sleeping (or trying to sleep). What a new mother needs in the hospital is rest and relaxation and time to bond with her baby. Oh and food is great, so the pizza from OP was perfect!", "People are never needed at hospital - unless they are doctors there\nIt\u2019s weird for me that people say \u201cI have to be there\u201d while they sit in the waiting room", "Yes and anyway when you have your second, you're alone a lot because others are taking care of your eldest. My husband would go back in forth between being with me and new baby and being with our toddler. I enjoyed the time to myself to recover and bond with baby.", "That whole obsession with grand babies trope is just gag worthy. It\u2019s possessive and unhealthy, I don\u2019t understand why society continues to spout that narrative", "I absolutely agree. It was several hours after the delivery, mother and baby were fine and even had other people around... Sounds like someone found it more important to gush over a newborn that she has plenty of time to gush over afterwards than honouring her daughter\u2018s accomplishments. I would be upset too if I was in OP\u2018s place.", "It was adding insult to injury to call OP selfish. OP was at the hospital all night with her family, and only needed a few hours in the afternoon. Mum's the selfish one, too excited about a grandkid to be reasonable, and now doubling down.", "Someone is the favorite and OP, with her \u201cfollowing in her footsteps\u201d trying hard to get equal attention.", "Also, nobody seems to consider that maybe sister might have wanted a couple of hours peace without the entire family there? Though she requested they be there for the birth, it's now 12 hours on from the birth and she might have just wanted a bit of alone time wit husband and baby. I'm just speculating here but it doesn't sound like mum actually considered what sister wanted regardless. NTA and OP is still incredibly gracious in a hurtful situation, I'm glad she doesn't resent her sister for it, who also sounds very reasonable.", "Not to mention that the sister remained in the hospital with an army of nurses and doctors around her - I don\u2019t know why the mom presumed she absolutely had to be there, too (especially since the sister didn\u2019t ask for it) but if I was OP, I\u2019d be heartbroken. NTA.", "This was my thought too. Is the partner not there for support or something?", ">12 hrs after the baby was born? All relatives should leave the hospital anyways\n\nWhere my partner gave birth they wouldn't even allow all those relatives to still stay there for that long, they're only allowed within visiting hours for a limited time. 12 hours seems pretty excessive, the baby and new parents were probably trying to sleep through most of that time anyway.", "Honestly, what was she doing while the graduation was going on. Staring at the baby? That couldn't have waited two hours? She's got a lifetime to goof off with the baby now. Shame on that woman.", "Yes. I could see for a few hours afterward. But 12? That\u2019s half a day and overkill by any standard. Especially since the mother and child were both doing well.", "Yeah the part about giving birth being more important was the cherry on top for me. It\u2019s giving motherhood is the best thing women can aspire to and the most precious gift they could receive (I never hear this with men and fatherhood). Funny because OP\u2019s mom failed on her mothering that day.", "Right? I don't know what the new mom is feeling but I read this and felt bad for both daughters! I hope everyone is good at setting boundaries for how they are willing to be treated by this new grandmonster", "The hospital only allowed two people at a time in her room. Husband never left her (understandably) so the other 4 of us (me, my parents, and MIL) rotated in and out every 15 minutes or so. If my sister was sleeping we made sure not to disturb her. It never seemed like my sister didn't want us there, and she did call and ask us to come, but after reading the comments i'm wondering if she maybe would have liked some space after the fact and didn't say so.", "Yes. This is the bigger picture: the new grandma values \u201cgRaNdBaBiEs\u201d above all else. Don\u2019t compete for the grandma\u2019s conditional love and support. She\u2019s not even really there for the other sister; *she\u2019s not even really there for the grandbaby*: she\u2019s there to bask in the glow of being Grandma^TM (i.e. an ego-trip).", "I thanked him as well! I just specifically talked about my mother because I'm following in her footsteps career wise so I talked about how watching her in our field as a kid inspired me.", "Honestly, growing up, no she didn't. But ever since my sister got pregnant she has, but I feel like that's understandable and somewhat normal. It hasn't bothered me until now.", "Not needed-and probably not wanted either after the first hour.", "Everyone keeps mentioning husband and MIL were there if the new mom needed anything...wonder if that's the rub. Is there 'conflict' or jealousy between MIL and mom?? Poor OP is probably a casualty of her mom's baby rabies.", "Mom?", "OP is an A because she has feelings?", "It's not a \"beck and call\". How ridiculous. It's an agreed-upon even well in advance, a moment of pride for both parent and child. It's totally reasonable to want to celebrate with people who mean something to you. And while a parent's obligation to provide for you ends at 18, their emotional obligation to you doesn't. They're your family. If you have a good relationship with them it is very reasonable to expect that they would want to be present at moments of pride for you.", "Not that it matters IMO but no she actually hasn't been to my graduations before. I didn't go to my high school graduation because I chose to go on a college visit instead (yes, that was on me i know) and I didn't have a graduation for my BA because of COVID. \n\nShe literally did say the baby was \"more important\" so I don't see how you think she wasn't saying it was less than.

Mom could've done this too.", "Stop it.\n\nGrandma had been at the hospital for 12 hours already and met the grandbaby.  Grandpa went to the graduation and was away from the hospital for THREE HOURS.\n\nShe absolutely could have left the hospital briefly.

There's no reason for her mother to miss the graduation ceremony.", "It quite clearly states in the story that there were no complications and her husband and father of the baby as well as her MIL were still at the hospital.", "OP said in the post that her sister alsonhad her husband and MIL with her at the hospital, so not a single mother, and nothing in the post alludes to a complicated birth.", "I wouldn't have cared so much if I didn't win the award and have a speech. I guess maybe it's stupid but it mattered to me.\n\nI didn't exactly have the time of my life sitting in the waiting room for 12 hours waiting to see my sister for 15 minutes at a time but I did it because I care about my sister and my nephew. I guess to me some things in life we do because they matter to our loved ones even if we aren't having a blast. idk.", "Ok look, just because you couldn\u2019t graduate high school doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is dumb for wanting their parents to be there to celebrate with them.", "Wow you must be a fun person to be around.\n\nJust because you\u2019re salty about graduation ceremonies doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is.

There are too many mothers not worth the name for anyone to be judged for being justifiably hurt and not wanting to be reamed out by the person that hurt them.

I bet the sister wanted mom to leave. I had a baby a few months ago and had family visit for a few hours and that was plenty.

She might have been wrong, but it hardly makes her the worst mother ever.", "I'm sorry but that is pretty ignorant. \n\nI was there every second when my two kids were born and due to covid I wasn't able to be at the hospital when my first grandchild was born and it tore me up.  Just because you don't see any need for family support during childbirth, don't pass judgement on those that need their family there and the family that wants to be there.", "Visitors don't usually just sit in the waiting room. Postpartum, visitors are needed because the nurses just expect you to be able to take care of this tiny little person all by yourself - even if you just spent 36 hours or labor or just had a c section and can't even stand up. It's really helpful to have someone with you who can take care of the baby. However, OP did say that sister's husband was there, so he should've been more than capable of taking care of the baby.

I'm in the US and in the area I  live in, it is expected that family actively care for the patient.

The moment the new mother said go she should have went. At this point she was not there for moral support and I\u2019m sure the other at least four people in the room could pass her food if needed. This was not needed the mother is being selfish and wanting to one up MIL not be there for her child. OP is just as much her child she should have been there fore to.", "Same scenario for my family. The hospital would absolutely have killed my brother if my parents hadn't been there. I know having them with him around the clock was grating at times, but it was incredibly fortunate that they could be there. The social and emotional support aspects were huge, and they brought him comfort items and food that comported with his dietary needs as the hospital seemed incapable of understanding his significant intolerances and the fact that he couldn't eat solid foods due to his illness.\n\nThey also quite literally saved his life multiple times. One that comes to mind is when he awoke and groggily tried to ask a nurse what new medication she was administering, and she couldn't tell him what it was or who prescribed it and was ignoring his explicit refusal until our dad stepped in. Turns out she was mistakenly giving him something for a different patient. Another nurse was recording every food item that entered his room on his chart as something he had eaten, when the hospital was arranging for meals that he absolutely could not eat. That mistake meant that the rare doctor visits were coloured by misinformation, and doctors were highly skeptical of my drugged up brother trying to explain that his objective chart was totally wrong.", "Love them, sure.

Give me a grandbaby!\" is the trope. Not simply someone loving a child.", "There's a difference between loving and obsessively making an infant (that isn't actually yours) the center of your life. There's also a somewhat common trend of parents badgering their adult children to \"give them grandbabies\" and making \"grandma\" their entire personality (because let's face it, it's more often women who are obsessed with babies in general).\n\nNo one is saying she can't or shouldn't love her grandchild, and you inferring that from the other person's comment is what's truly ridiculous.", "No, it's that it's become obsession -like. The clingy obsessive nature and the \"I want grandbabies\" thing is way too common.  There's love and there's baby crazy.

The newborn isn\u2019t going to remember whether anyone was there. And they\u2019d already met the newborn. Not sure what costs spent in high school have to do with graduating from grad school, but in my 4 graduations the only robe I spent anything on was high school and was like $25. No rings or school uniforms or sports shit, but lack of those didn\u2019t change the importance of graduating from grad school.

She has 3 boys and a master's degree.", "Lol it does sound creepy i guess but no, we didn't really \"watch\" her sleep.

I just feel like 12 hours passed and it was okay to step away, briefly- even my sister said so. It sounds like you just think graduations are stupid and that's totally cool. I guess my question is at what point would it have been okay to expect my mom to come in your view? Several days later? A few months?

Her actions hurt her child. Can they repair later? Probably, if mom has actually been a good mom before this. But OP is not a AH for not wanting to listen to mom calling them names for daring to think their mother would take a few hours to be there for them.
