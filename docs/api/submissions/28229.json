I was told at 18 I had less that 1% chance to get pregnant with out medical help.  My husband (36M) and I tried for 4 years, and right when I was about to talk to my doctor about what the next steps would be for treatment, I ended up pregnant and gave birth to our son.\n\nWhen our son was 4, we started trying for a second baby, knowing that while it would be a long journey, it was possible.  We did look into getting the medical help this time, but my insurance wouldn't cover it and we did not have the money to afford it, so we just prayed that the old fashion way would work like it did with our son.  \n\nWell, our son is now 10, and I had basically given up on having a second child when we found out that I was once again pregnant!  We were over the moon on being able to complete our family.  We told our son, who is beyond excited to be a big brother, and told our families and friends the good news.  I couple of weeks later, at a BBQ a friend was hosting, I was talking to my best friend about it and she was excited to plan my baby shower for me.  She was unable to plan the shower for my son because she lived too far away and was busy with working and grad school, so to get a chance to do it this time made her happy.  A couple of other people over heard us and starting telling us that it was tacky to have a baby shower for the second born child, that only an attention seeking AH would throw a second baby shower.  My argument is that it has been 10 years since my son was an infant and we have either gotten rid of most of our baby things or they have expired.  The only things we have are our sons baby blankets and some sentimental baby clothes our son wore.  \n\nThese people scoffed and told me that if we couldn't afford a second baby, we shouldn't have a second baby and walked away.  The rest of the party they stood over on the other side of the yard and kept glancing at me and my best friend, sneering and giggling among themselves.  My mood was ruined, and just went through the motions of the rest of the party.  I ended up excusing myself early, claiming to be tired and nauseous from the pregnancy (the friend lives about two doors away from my house, so it was a quick walk home).   \n\nA little while later my husband came home, my best friend filled him in on what happened.  He told me to forget about those women, that they were just jealous and bitter mean girls who haven't really left high school.  He said that we can still have a baby shower if we want.  But now I'm wondering, even though it has been 10 years, if I would be an attention seeking AH for having a baby shower for baby #2.

(Which it is)\n\n\nI say any excuse to celebrate with friends and family is great. The focus is less on gifts unless people want to bring them. People love buying baby things. No one has to come if they don\u2019t like it. People can come celebrate and not bring gifts. Celebrate all the wonderful things in your life.  Congratulations on your pregnancy!!", "Dude are you kidding? NTA of course. It's not like you're shoving your baby shower up their ass that they got so offended. And who said you can have baby shower for only the firstborn? You're not forcing anyone to attend or bring your baby gifts. That person must be fun at parties", "NTA. One thing I don\u2019t get about people saying second and third etc baby showers being a gift grab is like\u2026. are you not gonna get the baby a gift anyway?????? It\u2019s pretty standard in a friendship/family to get the new baby a gift! something! anything!!! I don\u2019t remember the last time my mom was invited to a baby shower but she\u2019s always buying random friends and family members gifts for the new baby. If there\u2019s a party involved you get free food and a nice day out of it. Seems like a pretty solid reciprocol action to me", "YWNBTA\n\n(1) You didn\u2019t ask anyone to throw you a shower; your friend *volunteered* to throw you one because they wanted to.\n\n(2) Nobody keeps their all baby stuff for ten years.

I have an enormous family and just had to set a personal boundary for budgetary reasons. I\u2019d also never criticize someone for celebrating something they are excited about.

The people you invite are also free to accept or decline the invitation, those people had no business given their unwanted opinion about a party that doesn't affect them at all.", "NTA\n\nSecond showers are against the rules of etiquette. The rules of etiquette make weird assumptions about who\u2019s paying for stuff. Such as your friend can throw you a shower, but your sister can not because your family of origin will buy anything the guests don\u2019t. It\u2019s mental. \n\nI would be annoyed to be invited to a second shower three years later. You should still have all the stuff in that case. At least if you were asking for startup stuff- crib, car seat, etc. In your case, the longest life on any car seat is 10 years from example. Much of the stuff will be no good. I really fail to see the difference between asking for gifts for a second pregnancy vs a first. They are equally rude or not rude. \n\nIf they don\u2019t like it they don\u2019t have to go. In fact cut them off. If they had a concern and they were your friends they would have brought it up privately, not giggled at you from across the way.", "NTA...It used to be gauche, but people have third and fourth baby showers even.

I always thought  baby showers are about celebrating with your loved ones than expecting gifts.\n\nEdit: typo", "A second baby shower is tacky, but I would never tell that to the person doing it. A sprinkle is more appropriate. However, your case is different. A second shower is tacky because we assume you have the big items from the first still and you just get diapers, small clothes and small gifts for a sprinkle. But you likely don\u2019t have much of what you need. NAH because yes, they\u2019re tacky after the first, but you have a different circumstance", "NTA because there\u2019s a 10 year gap. However on principle I personally do think it\u2019s a tasteless gift grab to throw your own baby shower for people to gift you baby stuff especially when you\u2019re an adult parent already and can afford it yourself- so I kinda see where those people are coming from. However again, loads of people love them and celebrations are yay and you want one so go for it!", "Your friend offered to throw you a shower. If the other women don\u2019t like it, they do t have to come. \n\nI know a second shower is less common if you have a child close in age, but honestly, all babies deserve to be treated as special.", "I thought baby shower was to celebrate the baby to be and mother, how can that be considered tacky? Yes if you keep popping babies like one year after the other, might be expensive for those attending but this is not the case here.

I would recommend having a couples shower, as guys are really a lot less likely to care about the etiquette question.", "NTA to each their own, I personally do not like baby showers but I understand people wanting to celebrate in that way and have supported many people doing this. I see it from both sides. The side that is celebrating a new baby and the side that sees it as \"why should I be funding someone else's choices\" \n\nBecause it's your second, I see how it can look tacky. These people have already bought things for your other child and now they need to do this again. It's been a long time since the first one but still just giving you the perspective from their view. You could have had a celebration/party and not call it a baby shower. That way it's not totally asking people to startup fund your second child (no gift registry, less formal, no silly games etc)\n\nTheir actions/words were not nice though becasue again to each their own. They could have declined the invitation and left it at that. \n\nCongrats by the way! Have your baby shower and don't invite the mean girls!", "You personally should not have a baby shower but your friend could do one for you. Only invite people that you know would want to come.

You shouldn\u2019t expect people to spend a ton of money.", "I totally barely skimmed this and saw there\u2019s a 10 year gap, so no, NTA based on that alone.

And if you have a baby girl you'd need a lot of new stuff anyway.\nCongrats btw. Judgmental people can go fly a kite.", "NTA - I feel like common etiquette is that when it's so far out from the last baby, it's acceptable.

Surely a baby shower is to celebrate the new life you have created, whether it's the first or the fifth? NTA", "NTA. I don't think there is anything wrong with another shower.

I was told at 18 I had less that 1% chance to get pregnant with out medical help.  My husband (36M) and I tried for 4 years, and right when I was about to talk to my doctor about what the next steps would be for treatment, I ended up pregnant and gave birth to our son.\n\nWhen our son was 4, we started trying for a second baby, knowing that while it would be a long journey, it was possible.  We did look into getting the medical help this time, but my insurance wouldn't cover it and we did not have the money to afford it, so we just prayed that the old fashion way would work like it did with our son.  \n\nWell, our son is now 10, and I had basically given up on having a second child when we found out that I was once again pregnant!  We were over the moon on being able to complete our family.  We told our son, who is beyond excited to be a big brother, and told our families and friends the good news.  I couple of weeks later, at a BBQ a friend was hosting, I was talking to my best friend about it and she was excited to plan my baby shower for me.  She was unable to plan the shower for my son because she lived too far away and was busy with working and grad school, so to get a chance to do it this time made her happy.  A couple of other people over heard us and starting telling us that it was tacky to have a baby shower for the second born child, that only an attention seeking AH would throw a second baby shower.  My argument is that it has been 10 years since my son was an infant and we have either gotten rid of most of our baby things or they have expired.  The only things we have are our sons baby blankets and some sentimental baby clothes our son wore.  \n\nThese people scoffed and told me that if we couldn't afford a second baby, we shouldn't have a second baby and walked away.  The rest of the party they stood over on the other side of the yard and kept glancing at me and my best friend, sneering and giggling among themselves.  My mood was ruined, and just went through the motions of the rest of the party.  I ended up excusing myself early, claiming to be tired and nauseous from the pregnancy (the friend lives about two doors away from my house, so it was a quick walk home).   \n\nA little while later my husband came home, my best friend filled him in on what happened.  He told me to forget about those women, that they were just jealous and bitter mean girls who haven't really left high school.  He said that we can still have a baby shower if we want.  But now I'm wondering, even though it has been 10 years, if I would be an attention seeking AH for having a baby shower for baby #2.

If you had a special place in the family you might go all out and spend $50 or so on a silver spoon or some Peter Rabbit pottery.

I wasn\u2019t able to organise anything for the third, because I lived abroad during that time, but she threw one herself. I will say with us, people usually go all out with gifts on the first child and the gifts will be smaller with the children after that.

And then when the baby was born after whatever time the parents deemed appropriate, it\u2019s customary for outside family to visit and give more gifts, like diapers and clothes or hand made/keep sakes. And even then family members took turn after the baby was born to do the cooking/cleaning while the parents only focused on the newborn.\nAnd if you couldn\u2019t make it, now that DoorDash exists we DoorDash meals or supplies etc \n\nIdk I\u2019ve never viewed baby showers as a gift grabber as some have commented.

The shower doesn\u2019t have to be about the gifts (saying this to the public, not you OP). Just a fun BBQ to cekebrate the new addition is always welcome and people who want to gift can and those who don\u2019t do not have to. However, being it\u2019s 10 years later I would hope people would understand you have 0 baby things anymore! \n\nMaybe you could include a \u201cin lieu of a gift, please bring a favorite book signed for the baby\u201d line if you don\u2019t want people to gift.

Don\u2019t worry about those negative, malicious women. You enjoy your baby and your baby shower!", "It's also not recommended to use a crib that's more than 10 years old.

THIS 100%!", "The idea behind a baby shower is that everyone comes to celebrate the soon-to-be new baby, yes, but also the reason it's called a baby *shower* is because it's expected that the new mother will be *showered with gifts* at the celebration. And often the gifts are all supplies and items needed for the new baby.\n\nSo the thought process is, if you have two kids within fairly close succession to each other, you shouldn't do a shower for the second baby as most of the items/necessities (especially big ticket stuff) have already been gifted at the first shower or purchased since the birth of the first, and asking for your friends and family to buy even more stuff for you can feel rude to people. \n\nWhich is where the baby \"sprinkle\" people have been bringing up comes in to play. You do the whole baby shower party and games and celebration, but there's not really a focus on gifts or getting needed items for the baby because you're already all stocked up.", "I'm not disagreeing with you, just explaining: the reason showers can be considered \"tacky\" after the first baby is that theoretically, the point of the party is to give the expecting parents things they need for the baby, because that's a lot of stuff you need to get all at once, so your loved ones help out. So having a second shower, according to the \"it's tacky\" people, is like demanding another round of gifts. Parties for second (or third, etc) babies where it's less about gifts would usually be called something else (\"sprinkle\" is a common one).\n\nObviously, the logic for why you have a shower for the first baby still pretty much applies in OP's case so that sounds fine to me. Plus, invitations are not commands - if someone doesn't want to get a baby gift for anyone other than a firstborn child (which like hey, younger siblings are people too!), they can always just politely decline. And more importantly, even Miss Manners says it's the height of rudeness to point out someone else's lack of etiquette. So if those people at the party actually cared what's rude or tacky, they should have kept their mouths shut. NTA.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t get it.

Most people I know do not keep newborn stuff especially TEN years later and for a new baby it is still needed.

The only thing kept is sentimental items.", "I always viewed the party as a welcoming someone into motherhood/ parenthood for the first time.

It\u2019s meant to be a way of distributing the cost of a milestone event over the whole community. So a wedding shower is supposed to give the couple items they need to set up housekeeping and a baby shower is supposed to give the parents the items they need for their baby. \n\nI\u2019ve been taught that the rule is you only get one shower where you expect your community to shell out for the expensive items like stroller, crib, etc. It\u2019s expected that gifts will be given for the second child, but usually it would be a less expensive gift like a cute outfit or some storybooks. A whole shower sets the expectation for larger, more expensive gifts and that can be seen as greedy and tacky. \n\nI\u2019d still go to a second shower and wouldn\u2019t complain, but I\u2019d give a smaller gift.", "Yeah I\u2019ve never heard of that before.

Reading all these responses has help me see that they are just being petty mean girls.", "This \"you can only have one baby shower\" thing is absolutely baffling to me because I've never encountered this mentality in the wild. I've always thought that the shower is for the new baby so each baby gets a shower.\n\nMy mom had 4 baby showers, one for first baby, the next 2 years after the first, and 2 for the last baby 12 years after the second. the youngest got 2 due to planning issues and two different people insisting that they wanted to throw the party, but refused to host together.", "I'll confess that, internally, I'd be rolling my eyes all the way back if I overheard OPs discussion. After reading many comments, I find yours the most compelling. Thank you for adding some perspective.\n\nOp could really smooth things over with verbiage on the invite.  Unexpected weather puns or something? A way to communicate that they'd like to celebrate before baby 2 and ...idk a light, reasonable registry of only needs?", "I had an entirely different set of friends when I had my second, they all were attending their first shower for me.

Just cuz you already have a kid doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still need stuff. Cribs turn into full sized beds, diapers and wipes, toys or rockers that broke for first kid or overused or not safe anymore. \nAdd on top of this there\u2019s a 10 year difference!

Let the trash take themselves out.", "Do you think people who throw weddings are assholes too?", "You need a life.", "Ah, yes, let's expose the new baby to all those germs and put a ton of pressure on a freshly post-partum mother to throw a party.", "I am so confused by this. You know people have a choice to participate, right? How is she the AH for wanting to celebrate the new life she thought would never come? If ppl don\u2019t feel like bringing a gift or coming, they can opt out. Her friend wants to celebrate her and she is accepting. What is tacky about that?", "She's not making a list nor asking everyone else to pay for her child.

The only items we have been worried about getting is the crib and carseat, but my in laws have already said they would help us with those (this is just their second grandchild and are very excited to have another one to spoil as rotten as they have my son lol!).  I even told my best friend that the only thing I really want to do is a diaper raffle (we did this for my son's baby shower and it was wonderful not having to worry about diapers for a few months).

My other cousins wife planned a nice shower for them at my aunt and uncles house. Their first baby was born in 2020 so they weren\u2019t able to have a proper shower.

We brought some small gifts for the new baby and some books for their toddler (English PhD mom loved the books).", "Exactly! The friend was so excited to plan the shower that she brought it up! That's so sweet! It's been 10 years and many people I know have had \"sprinkles\". One of them was 6 years apart and it was more of a celebration than just trying to get gifts. \nNTA.", "I threw a sprinkle for my friend because her second was a girl, first was a boy.

We have been a bit sticker shocked at how expensive things have gotten in 10 years, and we are in the process of buying a house and a new car (like I said, we had basically given up ever having a second child)  Thankfully my in laws are going to help us with the big ticket items we need (crib and carseat).  I just want a party to celebrate this little miracle for us.", "You know, if that's what a sprinkle is, OP definitely deserves a shower. My kids were 9 years apart, different genders, and were born in different states. I had almost nothing for the second baby, but I got some sweet things at thrift shops. Our friends and my colleagues were so excited about baby #2, they threw TWO baby showers. \n\nI'd happily chip in for larger items for the OP regardless of whether or not the OP could afford to buy them.", "We had a sprinkle for our 2nd and told everyone no gifts. We just wanted to celebrate our baby coming into the world with a few friends and family. Barely 15 people including children so it was never anything big. We got asked what we needed and we told everyone nothing as we got it all sorted ourselves.", "Thanks! I wasn\u2019t sure on how long it wasn\u2019t safe for cribs!", "I think that's due to lead based paint being used in the past.

I went to a baby shower last month and it was for her second kid in 3 years and I didn't think anything negative of it. I just had to be extra picky when shopping for the gifts because I figured she already had a few things, but I wasn't judging her for it lmao.

So people don\u2019t feel they need to pay for diapers and a pricey gift off the registry", "Exactly! \n\nThe whole mentality is similar to the old fashion tradition of the brides family paying for the wedding.

How over the top.", "While it is generally frowned upon to have a shower for a second (or third or whatever number) baby, I believe there has long been an exception for situations like yours, where the gap between children means the parents no longer have baby stuff from the first one.\n\nBut even if that weren't true, it is incredibly rude to criticize others' manners the way those people did yours and your friend's, so they were doubly in the wrong.\n\nI hope you enjoy your (in no way inappropriate) shower, and your second beautiful baby.", "Baby showers and sprinkles dont have to be about gifts! I wanted to have one but just to celebrate and have good food with friends, gifts not necessary at all. In fact, you can find really affordable like new cribs on offer up and facebook marketplace.

If you really \"just want a party\" then you could just have... a party.

No cribs before 2011 should be used because the manufacturing standards changed significantly. Storage matters too. Regular furniture tends to stay in your house being used. Cribs get put into storage in garages and basements where they might suffer water damage, etc. Safe sleep is so important. I just wouldn't risk it.", "Safety standards change as kids die from stuff we didn't realize was dangerous.", "> A crib? Why on earth would a crib be unsafe?\n\n\nSafety standards do change.  The general rule of thumb is if a crib is more than 10 years old to not use it.  My husband has two much younger brothers who were 13 and 9 when my son was born, and my in laws originally wanted us to use their crib because they still had it.  However it was a dropside crib, which have basically been banned because of how dangerous they can be.  I was a daycare teacher and I remember when they made the change and we had to get rid of all our cribs and get new ones, and the state basically beat us over the head about the dangers.  I shared this with my in-laws and they helped is find a nice crib for our son.  They have also agreed to help with this one too.", "And even if it's your first baby I will judge the crap out of you for *demanding* brand new expensive gifts. They're gifts. Not taxes.", "Third and higher = those nasty types who Keep Having Children, you know the ones.", "I mean, if you got married twice, you'd be asking from the same people twice lol. You don't HAVE to bring a gift to an event.\n\nAlso cribs do expire/become unsafe. You shouldn't use a crib over 10 years old and ones over a certain age are actually illegal here.", "From what I can tell by reading these comments, it is highly cultural. Where I'm from having multiple is pretty taboo. Fair enough and TIL!", "It\u2019s about celebrating and supporting mom and baby. Presents are traditionally brought.

I thought that was the standard. Huh.", "Be extra cautious about the car seat, they have expiration dates, and are supposed to not be used again if it\u2019s been in any sort of crash even a minor one. So make sure you trust who you get a second hand one from to be honest about it\u2019s history and check the expiration date", "Looking brand new and being brand new are two totally different things. Every car seat technician will tell you that you should never get a car seat second hand unless you know 100% of the history. A LOT of people don't follow manual instructions on cleaning their car seat and use cleaners that are too harsh, or soak their straps. Both of these things ruin the integrity of the straps and/or can strip them of their fire proof coatings. I highly recommend the Facebook group Car Seats for the Littles. Even the cheapest car seat has to pass the same safety tests as the most expensive ones, cheaper doesn't mean less safe.", "A close friend of mine threw me a 'sprinkle'.

Those were awesome for the first several weeks after our second was born!", "I responded to another commenter before reading this. Is a crib a wooden bed for children? Or have I misunderstood?\n\nI used my own old bed for my children,my parents had saved it. The wood will smell or show visible signs of damage if store improperly.

Ok never mind on the crib then. In general because of the gap I don\u2019t have a problem at all. Ideally I wish we (US) could celebrate things without it looking like a gift grab. \n\nI would look at someone funny for registering for household goods at a second wedding.

Didn't even have a \"sprinkle\" for the second one.", "Yes this ! The ones I get people are very good about posting a photo of the expiration date as well. Many of them people also say are strictly for trade in only, the Buy Nothing group I\u2019m in has great honest people. I\u2019m in another mom group and they frequently post used but no accident carseats etc. I get the toddler carseats new though, since they get used a lot more not many come up in good shape or ok to use.", "Not disagreeing! I trust the people in my particular BN group, esp. the mom I got my most recent carseat from. I don\u2019t get carseats in public selling markets where I don\u2019t know the people as well. Toddler seats I get new because they are used so long and get pretty beat up, honestly only the infant ones are worth getting used from a trustworthy source, but that is of course up to OP.

Sometimes people just can't take a hint.", "I think the general idea is that you'd still have/ use the stuff from the first baby unless the timing is such that you still are using them, and/or so long that you got rid of them, as in OPs case.", "It\u2019s the same in the US. People who haven\u2019t had babies recently just might not be aware of it."]}
