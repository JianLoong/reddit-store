My girlfriend comes in and starts getting ready, says \"I think I'm just going to shower tomorrow.\"\n\n\r  \n\"Didn't you go to the gym though?\"\n\n\r  \n\"Yeah, but I didn't really sweat that much\"\n\n\r  \n\"Still feels sketchy. Just a hygeine thing. Do you mind just rinsing off real quick before you get into our bed?\"\n\n\r  \n\"Fine.\"\n\n\r  \nShe takes a 10 minute shower, and after getting out acts really annoyed with me for the rest of the evening. I try to clear the air before we go to sleep. \"I have a right to be annoyed\" she says. I reply: \"Sure, and I also have a right to ask for my preferences when it comes to our bed and hygeine.\"\n\n\r  \nShe goes on to explain that she wore long sleeves, and only her hands made contact with the equipment, which she has washed, and that it's not like she is sleeping in her gym clothes.\r  \nThis might have been helpful information to share beforehand, but I still think showering post-gym and pre-bed is not an unreasonable request. I also can be a bit of a germaphobe, so I'm open to the idea that I might be overreacting here.\r  \nWe can have different standards of cleanliness all day. But the thing that kind of bugs me is to be treated like what I'm asking for is unreasonable. Even having my request scrutinized feels kinda crappy, though I might just be overreacting.\r  \nShe apologized before we went to sleep, and I thought we were cool. We had a really nice day together, but then it came up again like 30 minutes ago. Turns out she still thinks I was being rude and unreasonable for asking her to shower after the gym, before getting into our bed.\r  \nShe starts saying that \"sitting at a restaurant is just as dirty as the gym\" and because I don't insist on showering before bed after going out to eat, that I'm in the wrong for asking this of her.

It sounds like she's hyper focused on the fact that you criticized her, and not necessarily the showering issue. Maybe she doesn't like that you thought it was gross and she thought of your request as you thinking she's gross? I know a few people like that and it's just easier to explain the situation as a matter of fact. People sweat on gym equipment. Those germs can transfer to the bedding.", "NTA just because she didn\u2019t sweat at the gym doesn\u2019t mean other people that used the same machines/ weights that she was using did\u2026 I know some people love to think that others clean off the equipment when they are done but most the time that doesn\u2019t happen\u2026", "NTA.

But if she washed her hands and changed clothes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely she was carrying any germs on the rest of her body. Regarding the sweat, while going to bed smelly is a no-no, some people will sweat a lot at night too when it\u2019s hot and humid and that\u2019s just a part of being alive and human.

She also can have her preferences, but then she can get her own bed where she can stank it up with gym sweat all she wants, alone.\n\nShe was being lazy and she didn\u2019t like being called out on it.

Y\u2019all should probably lay down some ground rules.", "No  NTA, easy one", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s not weird to want her to shower before getting in your shared bed, *buuuuut* she might genuinely not be sweaty. \n\nI have a unique perspective here\u2014 I\u2019m a trans man (born and doc said \u201cgirl\u201d but now I\u2019m a guy) and when I started testosterone I became *distinctly more* sweaty/oily/smelly. I sweat more now playing video games than I did as a girl working out\u2014 and I was literally an athlete, I went HARD at the gym.\n\nIf you\u2019re a cis guy you might not understand that it\u2019s very possible that she\u2019s telling the truth and seriously barely sweats. So maybe chill out hahaha", "NTA\n\nEww And long sleeves don\u2019t make you less dirty. She\u2019s not dirty because she touched the gym. She\u2019s dirty because she worked out.

I believe in body autonomy, and that at the same time being in a physically-close relationship and proximity to someone means conceding some of one\u2019s own autonomy to the other person (or people). \n\nIf you sleep alone, you can do whatever you want. If you aren\u2019t alone, then being a considerate person means doing your best to maintain your hygiene to a level that the other(s) can be around you. \n\nIt\u2019s unhygienic for her not to shower.

If you have a super specific OCD type thing, maybe it's reasonable to REQUEST she do a you favor.\n\nBut your not her Mom dude. If she doesn't smell, who cares?

If he wants you to sleep in bed, or have intimacy, he has yo literally wash that sh*tvoff.", "NTA. We both shower before bed and then my SO also showers in the morning after the gym.

My rule is you shower before bed no matter what you did in the day! Sorry!", "NTA\n\n\nIf you go to the gym or even just do a task that makes you sweat a lot like being at work you should shower. I hate not showering after I get home from work.", "Did you both go to the same gym? Like did you see what kind of workout she did?  For all you know she may have went to the gym and socialized the whole time.  If she truly had a sweat session I think it would have been visible in her overall appearance. While you are allowed your preferences I do think you\u2019re a jerk for kind of making her shower. Who are you to tell her what to do? You sound like a great catch\ud83e\udd74. She should run far away", "If she didn\u2019t actually smell, and you weren\u2019t planning to have sex, then YTA, because it\u2019s just your *idea* about how dirty she is that\u2019s bothering you. I can totally see having showered earlier in the day, not having gotten sweaty, and being too tired to shower that night.", "YTA.  Seriously.  I shower every day and certainly after a workout, but why would I care if my wife showered at night or in the morning.  It\u2019s not a hygiene issue.  You\u2019re not going to catch the plague from her.  You have a hang-up and you are trying to tell your partner what to do because of it.  Work on you.", "NTA, and I say this as a frequent gym-goer. I always at least rinse before bed, but I have totally taken naps in the bed without having showered yet. \n\nIf my husband told me he would prefer me to rinse before getting into the bed for a nap, or sleep on top of the covers, I would understand and be accommodating. It\u2019s his bed too.", "NTA why are there people arguing over whether it\u2019s ok to ask someone to shower after 1) exercising 2) in a public setting\u2026 that\u2019s just basic hygiene and courtesy if you are sharing a bed with someone", "I would freak out if someone laid in my bed after the gym and didn\u2019t shower.", "Yta- only because in your replies it\u2019s not about the sweat to you, which you should prob add to the post since that\u2019s what everyone is judging by. But only requiring a shower due to her physically being at the gym, not due to her sweating makes you the AH here. Seems like she was tired, changed for bed and just wanted to take a shower in the morning.", "NTA.\n\nYou shower after the gym always.", "NAH but different perspective:\nDo you sleep hot and sweat a lot in your sleep? A lot of men do. Whereas women tend to sleep cold and sweat little. It's possible that you make the bed sweaty on the regular, in which case I could see her being a little annoyed that you complain when she does it once (after changing into fresh clothes already).", "I can\u2019t imagine getting into a bed by myself, let alone another person, without first showering after the gym.\n\nAs far as I know, people aren\u2019t profusely sweating at restaurants to the same extent they do in gym equipment. \n\nShe\u2019s right, though, in that one\u2019s preference shouldn\u2019t supersede the other. And you don\u2019t have the right to deny her the bed because of your discomfort.\n\nI think the highest EQ move in this situation would be for you to sleep on the couch if it\u2019s an issue, then change/wash the sheets the next day. Rather than making her conform to your standards, which can come across as controlling.\n\nNAH", "NTA. She\u2019s gross and has no right to be mad.", "That\u2019s nasty\u2026", "NTA and I would start paying attention to her hygiene habits, if she doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with this situation, then she might have some other nasty habits you haven\u2019t noticed yet.", "NTA that\u2019s fucking gross.", "NTA but she has the right to be gross if she wants, just let her be, let her see the consequences of not showering, and if you\u2019re so concerned of your sheets, divide the chores. \nSometimes you only want to sleep.", "NTA. Sweaty skin can breed bacteria. It\u2019s disgusting going to bed without washing.", "NTA. that\u2019s disgusting. it doesn\u2019t matter if she was wearing long sleeves and \u201conly her hands made contact with equipment\u201d. It\u2019s nasty. Doesn\u2019t matter if she didn\u2019t sweat that much. It\u2019s very reasonable and expected to shower after the gym & definitely if you\u2019re going to be sharing a bed with someone else. It\u2019s rude that she wouldn\u2019t just automatically shower first. It takes only 10 minutes.", "NTA and you can\u2019t compare eating at a restaurant to working out at a gym. If you are sweating at a restaurant then there is a serious issue with the heating in that restaurant", "NTA, but I will say I am different. I have a real fetish for loving to give post workout oral sex\u2026but I know that\u2019s not for most.

Her clothes aren\u2019t ready impenetrable barriers to everything that spreads at a gym.

I always shower after the gym, and anybody with common sense would. \n\nHonestly, though, I feel like both of you are making way too big of a deal out of this. She apologized and then brought it back up? Dude. And, OP, you need to just drop it as well.

Hopefully you figure this out.", "She's your girlfriend. You probably lick her arsehole, why are you so concerned you might have some of her sweat in her bed?", "Yta in my opinion.

As long as she plans on getting a shower in the morning then there\u2019s nothing wrong with it.", "Is she unaware of the intricasies of female hygeine and how bacteria growth can lead to a yeast infection in her private parts. \n\nJokingly ask her whether her mom talked her about the birds and the bees, and how one maintains their hygiene.\n\nI mean, just the thought of her BO in the bed is a turn off. And she is making you feel like you\u2019re at fault. Wow\u2026 NTA", "Showering is a whole thing with long hair and curly hair. It's entirely possible that she was weighing all the crap that goes along with that. \n\nAlso curious if she just goes to the gym to spend time with you rather than working out working out.", "NTA. I would suggest discovering just how powerful a combination it is when you add both the \"power of suggestion\" and \"leading by example\".\n\nFor example, you could have told your partner \"hey I'm gonna hop in the shower so I don't ick up the bed, are you gonna hop in after I'm done, or do you want to go first?\"", "Fuck you\u2019re a sook. I didn\u2019t even need to read your whole boring ass story to know you\u2019re the AH. She\u2019s tired, let her shower in the morning. My misses doesn\u2019t shower after gym and I don\u2019t even bat an eye lid. Get over yourself. Life goes on, worry about the money you bring in, not making your misses shower because you\u2019re mentally Ill. Grow up.", "NTA. It's concerning that you have to ask somebody to practice a basic level of hygiene. Being single makes this scenario completely different - Go to bed as sweaty as you like.  However, in this particular case you are sharing common space I.e a sleeping area and that means there needs to be consideration and respect for the other person & their feelings. Her knowing that you can sometimes be a bit of a germaphobe should actually put her in a position to understand better why you might make that request. This was not an unreasonable request I might add. The greater concern here is her inability to understand / be adult about it.", "Not showering before bed, especially after a full day\u2019s activities or especially exercise, is fucking gross.

You\u2019re an asshole.", "No, it's called hygiene, just don't be a dick about it.\n\nI honestly didn't read your post, the subject doesn't need much thought.", "NAH\u2026. But you kinda AH for making a big deal of it. But get over it. America (and other places I assume) have dumb hygiene standards if this is one of them. If it\u2019s simply the germs that gross you out, you might as well just live in a bubble. Every semi-public place that you touch things is covered and by that logic you should pretty much shower after going anywhere. Honestly the idea that if you don\u2019t shower daily you have bad hygiene is insane. Maybe an un-popular opinion, but damn get over it. Are you worried about getting sick or do you just think it\u2019s gross? Honestly both are irrational fears unless you live in a bubble. Hope you don\u2019t own a dog, cause they literally step in their own piss every day. And people who don\u2019t like dogs suck.", "Personally, I like em hot n sweaty, gnomewhaimsayin?", "NAH. Kind of AH for being so overbearing about your preference. I think it's perfectly reasonable if she just felt lazy that night and felt like showering in the morning.

As partners you do what you can to get along best. She should be able to shower before bed if that is something that bothers you. If she said she didn't like dirty dishes in the sink you would both work it out to wash as you use or load the dishwasher.

My gym is a CrossFit gym, so I\u2019m not sitting on a bike others have sat on getting sweaty.

My parents only showered weekly, even when I was young we all did a bath once every 3 or 4 days. I had the water after my mum\u2026 nobody was ill due to bad hygiene and as far as I recall nobody smelled.

But since it's just me taking care of my hair, I took about 4 inches off and am really enjoying the versatility of it.", "I cannot obviously understand the full situation. But if you have a weak immune system that\u2019s is a medical concern, you probably shouldn\u2019t go to a public gym. Unless you have a shower leading into your house, you\u2019re gonna go bring things from the outside world into your home. I don\u2019t think showering is gonna mitigate the risk of catching something\u2026", "You are obviously missing my point.", "That\u2019s okay. I do!", "Certainly it\u2019s something they should agree on for the sake of peace in the household.", "Just cause someone doesn't smell, doesn't mean they're clean...", "This is the dumbest logic I\u2019ve heard lol just cause you don\u2019t smell doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re cleannn - 10 squats is very different from a full workout pls", "The fact that you still sit on benches with other peoples sweat and that the gym is just an unclean area in general. Its more that just not being sweaty", "Great comment! Doubt OP will read it \ud83d\ude44 \n\nAgreed on the compatibility thing. I don't understand why germaphobes can't just settle down with fellow germaphobes so they can just annoy the shit out of each other without tearing each other down because, you know, they're both demanding germaphobes.", "Unless she is completely out of it, she will see through this in a second. That is a pretty obvious passive aggressive remark.", "That' sounds manipulative to me, like you are trying to sell her on taking a shower. I think there's a way to tell her without manipulation or shame but it's tricky.  \n\nI'd be super blunt and end up offending the person either no matter what I say. Or I'd oversell my germophobia & let them think I'm insane if it'll convince them that a shower is the lesser of the two evils, two evils being gym germs vs my mental health. Damned if I do damned if I don't but I'll be damned if I sleep with them there gym germs!", "Conversely, maybe she doesn't think she needs it *because* she cleans the machines.", "No. I shower 2-3 times a day, MINIMUM.", "Some people go to the gym just to stretch some days!", "Well, strength work. Not every workout has to be sweaty.", "It\u2019s not about the equipment - if she went for a run around the block and didn\u2019t touch anything it\u2019d be the same issue.  You\u2019re working out, you\u2019re sweating.  Even if it\u2019s not obvious, you\u2019re telling me that when you work out your vagina or asshole doesn\u2019t get moi\u2026 sweaty?\n\nI\u2019m not a germaphobe, but don\u2019t f around with my bed.", "You don't think going to the gym is an obvious need to shower situation?  Then what *do* you consider to be an obvious shower situation?  \n\nYour body secretes fluids from just about every orifice which increase significantly while exercising while also shedding 600,000 skin cells each day.  But if you don't think you need to shower after all that to share a bed with someone, that's on you.", "Under the assumption they own it together she is still the one that ignores basic hygiene. For me it would be a deal breaker and I'd end the relationship.", "I smoke and I don't have lung cancer (yet)", "Think of all the dermatological research you might have saved", "To my shoulder blades. Although I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant. That\u2019s what hair ties are for.", "If people\u2019s shit didn\u2019t stink, they should still wipe and clean their asses in the shower. It ain\u2019t about smell\u2026it\u2019s about being clean in the place you sleep. I agree. \n\nBut\u2026I do think it\u2019s important for two people to both have a reasonably-agreed upon level of cleanliness for their bed. If both didn\u2019t care about showers or if both did, that would be fine. But it only seems fair for the one who doesn\u2019t need as clean a bed to defer to the one that does. Defer to the cleanest because it makes them less uncomfortable. Unless they want to change the sheets the moment sex is over and before they can fall asleep, in which case that\u2019s a bit unreasonable.", "Impressive that your skin can handle that.", "I mean, if you do some pull-ups, you\u2019ll sweat\n\nSure not as much as if you run for an hour just if youre working, you\u2019ll sweat", "For OP it is about the equipment. He specifically said so which is why the person you replied to gave that suggestion.", "But you a literally replying in a thread where it\u2019s not about the sweat, it\u2019s about where she was.", "Let's face it, she probably shat, pissed multiple times, had a sweaty arse crack from the gym at least, have a shower", "I love this sub because it\u2019s a picture into why so many redditors are single lmfao", "It's def relevant depending on your hair care routine.", "I mean, my hair poofs up and frizzes like a nightmare when I shower but don\u2019t wash my hair. I can tie it up but the steam from the shower just annihilates any semblance of control lol. Not saying that\u2019s a good excuse for making the bf uncomfortable but a hair tie isn\u2019t always gonna cut it.", "Whats impressive is being conscious to not spread germs and be hygienic unlike other people.", "As a small woman, you are incorrect. I can do some pull ups and not sweat. Sometimes our workout is just some deadlifts or overhead presses at heavy loads and I do not sweat doing those either.  I just don\u2019t sweat much (I don\u2019t wear deodorant and never feel any stickiness). I\u2019d be fine not showering after strength workouts in cool weather.", "Use a shower cap..", "I used to be the same way, I could do some exercises, barely make contact with what others used (hands/arms and bottom), not sweat, and smell fine. It wasn't until I hit my mid 30s and had some health problems that it changed. I still chose to shower as a mental break/shift into the next part of the day, but I could have easily gotten away without if I had wanted.", "Same. When I was lifting I hardly sweat and often wouldn\u2019t shower after. I\u2019m a clean person; I just don\u2019t see the point.", "I don\u2019t often shower without washing my hair so have never bought one, thanks for the tip though!"]}
