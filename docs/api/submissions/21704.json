Technology\u2026 sigh.\n\nLong time listener, first time caller\u2026 so, I (M) am in London for a couple days, and like any time I\u2019m near Marble Arch, I popped into Selfridge\u2019s for a Salt Beef Sandwich. For those who haven\u2019t eaten there before, they have this lunch counter with two lines, one for takeaway and one for table service in their seating area. The seating area is only enclosed by a low wall and not at all private (important later), and is packed with 2 and 4 tops.\n\nI wanted to sit, so I was in line for table service. There were two people behind me  in what I think were niqabs. When I was up next for seating, the server came up and asked how many in my party, but before I could answer one of the people behind me pushed forward and said \u201ctwo\u201d. The server, politely, told them \u201che\u201d gesturing at me \u201cwas here first\u201d. And after a brief argument with them about how the person ahead of them in line gets seated before them, proceeded to seat me.\n\nSo I was seated at a small 2-top with only one chair (a bench affixed to the wall) that faced into the seating area. I ordered, and then the table directly in front of me left, and was bussed. Next thing I know the people from behind me in line were seated there. They ordered and then my sandwich was brought to my table.\n\nI started to eat, but noticed they were getting increasingly agitated. Eventually one of them started snapping in the air until a server came over. They kept gesturing at me and talking at the server. At first I couldn\u2019t really hear what they were saying but they got louder and louder until I could hear. They were demanding I be made to leave so they could uncover their faces and drink their tea.\n\nI have no idea why I was singled out, but apparently, from what I could hear, my presence as a male by himself was the problem for them. The server never came over to ask me to leave or anything, so I just continued eating. But throughout my meal, they very loudly kept making nasty comments about my being there until they finished their tea and left.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think I was TA because I was there first, I had already ordered, and I wasn\u2019t interacting with them at all. Heck, I wouldn\u2019t have even noticed them if it weren\u2019t for the snapping for a server and then them being loud and angry.\n\nSo, why am I here? After they left, I texted a friend with a \u201cthe weirdest thing just happened\u201d and told them about it. My friend is normally down for a good eye roll, but this time they got pretty mad at me and told me I had been culturally insensitive, had disrespected the people\u2019s religion, was an AH for not realizing that as a single man I would cause them distress, and was \u201cthe reason people hate American tourists.\u201d They also told me the right thing to do would have been to take my meal to go and eaten elsewhere so the people sitting near me could have uncovered and had their tea in peace.\n\nSo, AITA here? What should I have done in this situation?\n\nEdit to Add: For everyone saying my friend is an idiot or \u201cbellend\u201d (ps I love that term, I may have to culturally appropriate it from you Brits), they\u2019re generally not. Which is why them getting/still being upset with me has me questioning if I was inadvertently an AH.", "created_utc": 1688844787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ud5i6/aita_for_being_culturallyreligiously_insensitive/", "score": 495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
