My son is about 3 months and hers is almost 2 months. For whatever reason, her milk did not come in/she is a severe under-producer so my nephew drinks formula. My son drinks breast milk. A while ago my sister asked if I could feed her son on my boobs after mine was finished. It was a little weird, but I said sure because I know she\u2019s worried about him not having antibodies and whatnot. I\u2019ve done this now probably about a dozen times, basically whenever we are together and my kid gets hungry, and it\u2019s not a big deal to me anymore. Anyways, because he eats after my son, my nephew never gets full because my boobs are almost empty at that point and so he ends up having to supplement with formula. My sister has never complained until the other day when she asked if her kid can eat first sometimes because it\u2019s not fair that mine never has to drink formula. I was unprepared to answer without sounding rude but I think it\u2019s a selfish ask. Also, my son has never had formula before, and I don\u2019t want to start him on it yet or maybe at all. However, I get that she\u2019s worried about her son not getting enough antibodies. WIBTA to say no?
