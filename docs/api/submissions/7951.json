It was a little weird, but I said sure because I know she\u2019s worried about him not having antibodies and whatnot. I\u2019ve done this now probably about a dozen times, basically whenever we are together and my kid gets hungry, and it\u2019s not a big deal to me anymore. Anyways, because he eats after my son, my nephew never gets full because my boobs are almost empty at that point and so he ends up having to supplement with formula. My sister has never complained until the other day when she asked if her kid can eat first sometimes because it\u2019s not fair that mine never has to drink formula. I was unprepared to answer without sounding rude but I think it\u2019s a selfish ask. Also, my son has never had formula before, and I don\u2019t want to start him on it yet or maybe at all.

But, OP, I would just tell your sister you're not willing to do it any longer, since she's already acting this entitled about it. It'll only cause more and more problems in your relationship when you're trying to do something nice.", "It\u2019s also possible that after 3 months OPs baby may be very reluctant to take a bottle meaning he could end up hungry and not getting anywhere near enough food for him.\n\nI remember my sister trying to get one of kids off breastfeeding and on to a bottle and it wasn\u2019t easy at all, she had to start off breastfeeding in a dark room and sneakily switch to a bottle which didn\u2019t always work", "I don\u2019t have kids but I learn a tip from a Turkish woman : fresh figs. Some of my friends used that advice and apparently it\u2019s amazing to produce lactation.", "False. I never formula-fed my child.", "There\u2019s a saying: \u201cFood before 1 is just for fun.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t NEED to supplement with food or formula before a child reaches a year of age if you have a steady supply of breast milk. Your milk changes as the baby grows to provide the child with everything they need. So you can exclusively breastfeed for the first year before introducing solids. In fact, you don\u2019t ever have to use formula. \n\nWith formula, you have to increase the amount as the child grows. With breast milk, because the milk is literally tailored for the nursing child, the milk\u2019s composition changes as the child grows, therefore the amount of milk needed does not increase. \n\nA younger child may take longer to nurse than an older child, simply because older children are more efficient at getting the milk quicker. 2 month old could take 40 minutes to drink 2 oz of breast milk, while an 8 month old might take 10 minutes to drink 2 oz of breast milk. \n\nI exclusively breast fed my daughter for 14 months, before she was ready to move onto solid food. I never once had to supplement with food or formula.", "Spotted the whatnot and wondered", "Every body is different. I had a massive over supply. I could feed my son off one side and still pump another 200ml, and then pump 4-500ml off the other side when he was still very young. I had to actively work to decrease my supply. \nIt was incredibly uncomfortable and I ended up very ill with mastitis often until I was able to decrease it.", "There\u2019s a very wide range of milk production and calorie needs in infants. But it\u2019s pretty common for women to be able to breastfeed twins without issues. \n\nUsually people start offering foods because babies get interested in tastes and textures and there\u2019s no reason not to when they\u2019re old enough and it\u2019s safe, but calorie production is not always an issue.  \n\nMilk production, when it\u2019s going well, is usually driven by the infant\u2019s previous demand. If a breastfeeding mom were to nurse an extra kid at the same time every day she\u2019d have plenty of milk at that time within a few days. This \u201csometimes when we are together\u201d thing doesn\u2019t trigger the same response.", "There are no cites on that non academic blog.", "You have a superficial understanding. The more milk is removed, the more milk is made ... But NOT IMMEDIATELY, and not indefinitely.", "This.  The issue isnt \"can a person breastfeed twins\"   It's \"is it feasible to develop the milk supply to satisfy two babies occasionally and one baby all the time\"\n\nAnd op will open herself up to mastitis if she tries.", "[the automod copy of the whatnot post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gk534/aita_for_asking_my_boss_if_he_would_be_willing_to/j536tvm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "Here\u2019s the original post text:\n\n- [auto-save comment for original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gk534/aita_for_asking_my_boss_if_he_would_be_willing_to/j536tvm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "I'll be saying that all day tomorrow..it's whatnotting?"]}
