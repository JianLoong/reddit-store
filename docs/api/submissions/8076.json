Plain and simple.", "YTA dude. If he wants to be alone then let him? If he doesn\u2019t want to date again after losing his wife that\u2019s his choice.

Dude you don't get to dictate his grieving process, and his therapist should know better than to pressure him into something he straight up says he's not ready for.

I have worked through every emotion/feeling with therapy. However, I do not want to date again. Your brother may never be ready to date someone else, and that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with \"moving on\" or being \"healed\". You and his therapist are AH.", "YTA. Apologize ASAP.", "YTA, he'll date when HE is ready", "YTA\n\nThis is all way too soon for him. No one has to date. Leave him be.", "It's his decision when and if he wants to date.\n\nThere is no timeline for grieving and no schedule of when it is time to move on.\n\nThe loss of a spouse is different than the loss of anyone else.

You and that stupid therapist need to back the fuck off!", "YTA: You and his therapist have both massively overstepped.", "Oops... you may have had good intentions but you jumped over his boundary line without any regard for him & made it all about what you think he should do.

You never ever get to suggest how long somebody gets to grieve for. Just over a year isn't really that long, and it's fine if he does decide to never date again. This decision is one he should make on his own - I don't even know why the therapist is pushing him to start dating. I agree that maintaining some kind of a social life will help, but that is very different from dating. \n\nI also cannot believe you're suggesting he tries to date a friend of his dead wife... Makes me feel like this isn't real.", "YTA\n\nHe may look fine on the outside but does that really mean that he is okay on the inside?\n\nI understand that you wanted to be helpful, but at the end of the day the choice is his and on top of that you did the AH move to speak of his dead wife not wanting him to remain alone and depressed as if you know what she is thinking. \n\nI suggest that you apologize to him for trying to manipulate him to start dating by using his dead wife as a tool and then you wait for his reply and accept that he may possibly never forgive you for using his dead wife to manipulate him to date another woman regardsless if it was or wasn\u2019t your intention to begin with!!", "YTA.

A young man who was widowed just a YEAR ago is not going to rush to get into a relationship again.", " YTA.. you may have good intentions, but unless you have buried a spouse, you have no clue what he is going through. Grief needs to be on his time table, sure as heck not yours. Maybe he will date again and just needs more time.\n\nKindly, back off and let him grieve how he needs to and make choices for himself.", "YTA. It is his choice if and when he wants to date again.

Let him set the pace, you pressuring him just makes this all worse for him and shows lack of empathy.", "Wow a year seems fast to me to start dating again. Surprises the therapist would push that.

Leave him alone", "YTA\n\nI only read the first line. \n\nNot your life, not your wife, not your decision.\n\nHe's grieving, and you're basically telling him to replace his wife", "YTA \n\nYou're not a huge ah but an ah nonetheless. He's already said he's not ready, he's not willing, forcing himself to \"get out there\" is only going to make him feel worse at this stage. It's only been a year, that's pretty short when you think about it. Instead of encouraging him to date, why not take him out to a movie or a bar, liven up his social life, tell him to think about asking some of his old friends to hang out.", "soft yta, i get your heart is in the right place but people grieve in different ways. I'd suggest instead of pushing him into the scary world of dating maybe something fun where he might meet people, like a jogging club or some such.", "YTA - Everyone deals with grief in a different way and who are you to judge him for wanting more than one year to come to terms with his feelings and move on (or not)?\n\nAnd then, there's this gem:\n\n>his wife's opinion doesn't really matter because she's dead\n\nWTF?! YTA and he's better off without you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA - I realize it's the brother saying that, but to push him so far that he would use that shows just how much he's hurting now.", "YTA, you had the best intentions, but bringing his deceased wife up as a reason was too much. That\u2019s where you crossed the line. \n\nI\u2019d apologize to him for that, and just explain you\u2019re worried that he\u2019s isolating himself. Then, instead of dating, find an activity the two of y\u2019all can do that will let him meet people platonically that will bring up few memories and allow him to live in the now.", "He\u2019s paying a professional to help him with a devastating loss. He and the professional can work out what is best for him. I think you should just support him and whatever his choices are. I have a friend who lost her husband seven years ago and she\u2019s just now admitting that certain gentleman are attractive to her. Everyone does grief differently.

Don't push him. He'll either date again or he won't.", "YTA. Boundaries dude. Who, when, why, or if your brother dates again is not up to you. Or his therapist. It\u2019s up to him. He\u2019ll date when he\u2019s ready to.", "YTA.  So much YTA. I\u2019m a widow. EIt\u2019s none of your business when he does or doesn\u2019t date, stay out of it.  Dating again is rife with complex emotions.  You have ensured your brother is never going to discuss his grief or his grief process with you. I don\u2019t discuss details of my therapy sessions with people I don\u2019t consider \u201csafe\u201d, I do turn to those I trust to help me continue to process.  You were a \u201csafe\u201d person, someone he thought he could discuss the nuance with; his internal conflict with.  Instead you jumped on it, and didn\u2019t help him talk it through.  \n\nI can almost guess what\u2019s going on.  Therapist told him something he\u2019s uncomfortable with; that he needs to stop wallowing and start socializing \u201cget out, do stuff, date if you want; you have to stop isolating\u201d and he zeroed in on dating because it evoked an emotional reaction.  He\u2019s not ready to date again, proof is his reaction to the suggestion.  Stop pushing.  Widows dating too soon is messy, invites innocent bystanders into the emotional war zone and hurts people who never asked for it.  \n\nHe came to you, and you whiffed it harder than Charlie Brown, bud.  Apologize, tell him you were a huge jerk, beg for forgiveness; and do not try to explain or justify your actions.  Just apologize and ask for forgiveness. Next time he comes to you with something like this, try asking \u201chow do you feel about that?\u201d before saying anything else.  The answer to that question will give you what he\u2019s really wanting to discuss.", "Yta. He doesn't need pressure to what everyone else deems the right timeline. He will get back out there when he's ready.", "YTA", "YTA & so is his therapist. Only your brother will know if & when he is ready to date again. Back off & listen to him!", "That doesnt sound like a good therapist. It may not even be a part of grief. Not saying it 100% isnt, but the guy may just not want to date", "A little more than a year ago??? That\u2019s crazy, Christ alive. Did she die during the holidays too? That makes it even worse. Apologise to your poor brother.", "YTA and quite frankly so is the therapist. He's not ready. He may not be ready for a very long time and if his therapist is pushing him to date when he's not ready, he should fire his therapist. This is NONE of your business and you way overstepped by bringing his wife into the conversation. Butt out and just support what your brother wants to do with his life.", "YTA \n\nThis is truly none of your business.", "NTA.  It's okay to speak on what you hope will be helpful to your brother, but mebbe you unintentionally made him feel pressured or judged.  Apologize, is my advice, and don't raise the subject again unless he does.", "A soft YTA\n\nWhile your intention is good, he's still grieving and you can't put a time line on that. Just because he seems to be doing fine in other area's of his life, he clearly isn't ready to date. \n\nPushing him is only going to cause issues. When he is ready it will happen. Be loving and supportive until then.", "I would say Y T A but you\u2019re well intentioned and basing your actions off of a \u201cprofessional\u201d opinion.\n\nThat said, the correct response to your brother should be that you support him on doing things in his own time.  Offer to invite him to social events (dating isn\u2019t the only way to socialize). And also offering support if he wants to change therapists.  I\u2019m personally very surprised that after about 8 months his therapist started to try to get him to date (and continues to push it) when he has clearly relayed he is not ready.", "NAH, though the phrasing was perhaps ill-chosen. Depending on his location, are there any new hobbies or activities you could suggest? A lot of places have co-ed amateur sports teams, or pub quiz nights, or something that would allow him to make new friends who don't remember him as half of a couple. Even if he doesn't meet new partners, he'll have fun and get to try new things or rediscover old interests.", "YTA. He doesn't want to date, leave him alone. Like he said, he doesn't want to to, and doesn't want to pump a lot of effort into a relationship for someone he doesn't care to be with. Some people need more time and some people just don't want to date. Maybe relationships deep down weren't really his thing and he wants to try being single and doing his own thing. Maybe spending time on his hobbies and building his career is more important to him now. Maybe he wants to do the things he wanted to while he was married but couldn't and relationships get in the way. I've been in his shoes (divorce, not a wife dying) but I don't have interest in dating and I don't think I find anything on earth more irritating than people telling me to date.", "NAH but a year afterwards is too soon for him. He will go out again when he's ready. You were just trying to be caring but you should stop pressuring him to date.", "It sounds like you're trying to help so there's no intentional maliciousness here, so you're NTA. However, you're not your brother's therapist, so don't try to act like it. If he feels ready to date, he'll let you know, not the other way around. If you're worried about his social life, try supporting him with activities with friends rather than romantic opportunities.", "Oh YTA.  One should never presume what a dead person wants.   \nStorytime!\n\nMy father died five years ago from brain cancer.  While he was waiting to die, because Glioblastoma leaves you with **nothing else to do** but wait, I consciously took myself out of the dating game and had a non-monogamous relationship with two different men - one in my hometown where my father was and one where I live.  I didn't want to get into something serious once we found out what my father's diagnosis was because the following sentence isn't exactly enticing:  \n \"Hi, nice to meet you, my father is my best friend and he's dying, what are your favorite hobbies?\" I also took off the year after he died because of the same sentence, only insert the words, \"my father just died.\"  \nDuring those two years, one of my partners asked me, \"Wouldn't your dad want you to be happy?  In a serious relationship?\"  And I just laughed because they didn't know my father.  I WAS happy with what I was doing.  \n\nHe's dealing with a lot.  Jumping into something new right after a very important person to you dies is a huge deal.  He probably doesn't want to hang out with those friends because they remind him of her. \n\nI get that you mean well, but you sound incredibly insensitive.  Take the pressure off of him and he'll find his own way, if and when he wants to.  \n\nHe needs time to grieve and possibly a new therapist.", "NAH - I know you just want him to be happy, but pushing him into something he's not ready for is not helpful. It really has not been that long since his wife died, so back off and give him some space. If you've never been through it, you can't understand what he's going through. \n\nIt takes some people years to be ready to move on, and some people never want a new partner, and that's okay too. He might change his mind, and he might not. He has to find his way to happiness at his own pace, and if he's in therapy then most likely he's doing the work to get there. \n\nAlso, if his therapist has been pushing him for months, then they're probably not as good a therapist as they think they are. Therapists are supposed to reflect insights back to you to help *you* make *your own* decisions, not just tell you what to do.", "NTA as long as you\u2019re not badgering him with an unsolicited opinion.  Why did he get pissed just because you agree with his own therapist?  Did he tell you what his therapist said?  If he\u2019s not ready, he\u2019s not ready.  But if he\u2019s talking to you about it, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you expressing your opinion.  Some folks here seem to think you\u2019re forcing your opinion on him.  That would be the AH move.  But I don\u2019t sense that yet.

You were agreeing with someone you both recognize as an authority on mental health, and you\u2019re uncomfortable with your loved one suffering grief and loneliness. But that\u2019s what makes you TA here. I think you centered your own feelings over listening to and processing what he said.\n\nHe isn\u2019t ready to date, but a medical professional is pushing him to anyway. If a loved one wasn\u2019t sure about a difficult medical procedure, but their doctor pushed it on them anyway, what advice would you give? I\u2019d recommend they at least get a second opinion first. This is a pretty huge step for someone grieving a spouse\u2019s death and really soon. Like you went in for birth control and the doctor started pushing a hysterectomy.\n\nYou\u2019ve also assumed dating will be good for him. It might not be. It might unsettle all the progress he\u2019s made, send him into a grief spiral, and hurt him more than help. He knows himself better than anyone else does, so he knows if it\u2019s worth the risk.\n\nYou\u2019re right that loneliness isn\u2019t helping him, but you\u2019ve isolated him further by saying so. He was reaching out and talking to someone - you. Now, he can\u2019t talk to you either. I\u2019m really confused as to why you (and his therapist)  didn\u2019t just suggest he reach out to his late wife\u2019s friends instead? Pick up a hobby to make new friends? Join a support group? \n\nThere are lots of ways to not be lonely that don\u2019t involve romance.", "YTA, but I wonder if it comes from a place of just wanting them to feel better.\n\nIt took me longer than a year to consider dating, after going through something that wasn't even close to losing a spouse.\n\nYou don't NEED to be dating to be whole, you can be single your whole life and be whole. The people who date just to not be alone are doing it for the wrong reasons.\n\nYou should not push to dating, you should ask how he's feeling and be there for him. And tbh, if you really want him to just get laid then hire an escort", "You meant well but why? Let him take his time, it\u2019s only been a year.\n\nHe should get laid, I\u2019d have told him he can just date casually for the social interaction. I\u2019m sure a nice person wouldn\u2019t mind a free dinner with good company if your bro is up front that he\u2019s just casually dating and not ready for anything serious.\n\nBumble have a bff feature\n\nNah but really it wasn\u2019t the time to pipe in with your opinion\u2026why?", "Yta and the therapist should lose their license for malpractice", "Yep. While you meant well, YTA.", "Yta for pushing him to move on when he\u2019s not ready. Maybe he should reach out to friends more and socialize but I think you need to apologize. He shouldn\u2019t date around if he doesn\u2019t want to. Encourage him to do things that he enjoys.", "Not going to post a judgment. But there is a difference between opening your social network and dating. It's not fair to ask him to jump back into a relationship. It is fair to talk with him about creating new experiences and learning to get out doing things again. I would suggest taking a class or joining a gym.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s been one year, a lot of people wait longer than that before they TRY to date again, and telling him that he has no social life is kinda cruel", "YTA. He's still grieving in his own way, and even if he wasn't, no one likes unsolicited advice on their love life, especially when they already gave you their answer.", "YTA and his therapist was unprofessional. He doesn't need to start dating ever if he doesn't want to, and pushing him when he isn't ready can be really damaging (for both him and his rebound date).\n\nIf you're worried about him being socially isolated, then say that, because that is not the same thing at all. And if that's the case, you can encourage him to join social groups/look for volunteering opportunities, not to try to replace his wife! Twenty new friends going bowling, or accidentally finding a new social circle through helping out at a dog rescue, is far healthier than pushing for romance when he's not ready.", "YTA, and so is the therapist.\n\nThere is no indication that he's unhappy with his decision to not date anyone. He seems to be content with that at the moment, and maybe someday that will change. Maybe it won't. But in any case, he's completely right that it's his business and his alone.  It's very rude to suggest otherwise.", "YTA, why does him needing to get out more and meet new people equate to him dating someone new? There are plenty of ways out there to meet new friends he doesn't need to start dating to get out there. He's already told you he's not interested in dating, and it's been just over a year since he lost his wife. For some people, that's no time at all. Respect his boundaries and listen to him! When/if he's ready to start dating again is on him, and to be honest, it's no one else's business.", "YTA + therapist. Not even a year. Bloody hell.", "YTA. \n\nThis poor man has no one on his side to care for what is best for him. That is so gross, OP! Shame on you! He lost his spouse, and apparently even his therapist and siblings aren't interested in supporting him in his grief. Wasn't loosing the love of his life enough without making him feel like he can't even turn to his own family, too?! Jesus!", "Well that is a crappy therapist if I ever beard about one. Your brother is correct - he'll start dating whenever he's ready and that's all there is to it.\n\nYTA", "Why are you pushing him? This is the worst possible thing to do. That\u2019s insufferable and he needs to find a new therapist. Mind your business. YTA", "YTA. He will start dating when (or if) he is ready. Not when you told him so. It is not your business. And don't ever again use this line about what his late wife would want, because you have no way of knowing that, so such remarks are nothing but manipulation.", "YTA. Your brother will move forward on his timeline. Right now he\u2019s not ready. Leave him be. When / if he\u2019s ready he\u2019ll start dating again.", "My dude YTA. Just because he\u2019s doing good in your eyes doesn\u2019t mean he still isn\u2019t processing his grief. He gets to make that decision if and when he\u2019s ready to start dating again. Therapist sucks too", "YTA and he should get a new therapist. Pushing a widower into dating is a horrible idea. If he doesn't want that he shouldn't do it. It wouldn't be fair or kind to anybody he got into a relationship with because he wouldn't be fully invested. Back out of his personal life.", "YTA\u2014Back off and stay in your lane. Also, your brother needs to find a new therapist. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious that you love your brother, so the last thing you want to do is be the AH and push him away so he doesn\u2019t feel like he can lean on you.", "YTA\n\nThis is not therapy. This is treachery. Of the foulest kind.", "YTA - just apologize & practice being a good listener until you are asked to give advice. Also - probably best not to ever tell people what their dead spouse (etc) would want. \n\nYour brother was venting about his therapist it sounds like. Not sure if you realized.", "YTA. It's nobody's business but his own.\n\nI know if my wife died, I might date, but probably not.", "YTA and I question what your brother is interpreting as his therapist telling him to start dating, what\u2026 8 months after his wife\u2019s sudden death?! One year is not long AT ALL.", "YTA\n\nYour brother is a grown adult capable of deciding for himself when he's ready to date again. And quite frankly, there are too many guys out there still grieving for their spouse and nowhere near ready to date yet, trying to date regardless. Good on your brother for knowing he's not ready yet.", "It\u2019s only a year? YTA", "YTA\n\nA year is such a short time in the grieving process.\n\nWhat on earth is the therapist thinking?\n\nPressure from you both in this way is tantamount to bullying.\n\nSome people are ready to date weeks after they bury a spouse. Some people are never ready. He will know if/when the time is right.\n\nYou should basically back off and let him take things at his own pace and pray you are never in his shoes", "YTA\n\nAlso, he's not a child and you're not his parent so such a pushy way of trying to \"solve his problem\" by pretending you know better than him what he needs is inappropriate, regardless if grieving is involved or not.\n\nInstead of pushing him to sort his life out in the way YOU envision, be honest about your concern you feel for him, and let HIM decide if he wants to take you up on offer of help or not. Something like the following is a lot more appropriate, two adults in between:\n\n\"Hey bro, you know, I know you've been going through a lot this year, I can't imagine how hard it is and I get that you need to grieve in your own way - I gotta say though, I'm worried about you sometimes, you seem withdrawn and I worry that you're feeling lonely and I can udnerstand how it'd be hard to keep the social spirit up. Just know I'm here for you whenever, just let me know if you want me to invite you to social stuff or if you want more regular beer nights or whatever. I get that shit is hard for you, and I want to do my best to support you. I'd hate for you to have to go through it all alone.\"", "YTA. I'm giving you benefit of the doubt that you have your brother's happiness in mind, not this is not the way. You say he's handing it better than you, but you don't really know how he's managing day to day. He's young and in no rush. \n\nHis therapist is unequivocally wrong. They are not a good therapist if they're pushing dating at all. Apologize to him and tell him you'll never push dating again.\n\nHe may never date again. He may decide in a week, a year, in 10 years, or when he's 60 that he'd like to meet someone, but whatever he does, it will be on HIS timeline. I know you love him and want him happy, but he lost his forever person. Don't push him away with your ideas on what you think he needs. He needs a supportive sibling.\n\nAnd if he forgives you, just listen. And give him love. And support HIS place in this journey.", "There used to be standard rules, etiquette, about mourning, social rules that everyone knew and observed. These conventions regulated behaviors and, to some degree, emotional responses to grief. These rules are basis for plots in some Gothic, Victorian novels.  Now that society is more individualistic, more therapeutic, we don't know how to handle situations. \n\nSome people may grieve for the rest of their life. For your brother a year may be enough time for social convention. It is not enough emotional time. Let him meet someone naturally, at work, at church, in a sports club. Don't push him to bars or on Tinder.\n\nYTA", "My uncle died just a little over a year ago. I can't imagine people trying to push my aunt into dating lest it was on her own terms. He absolutely needs a new therapist.", "A year is nothing in trauma recovery time. He will date when he is ready.\n\nOP - apologize for your overreach here.", "Especially an accidental and unexpected death. That\u2019s not exactly a \u201cfunerals over, time to move on\u201d kind of trauma.", "_\"Doesn't want to go through the trouble for something he doesn't want.\"_\n\nExactly! Some people take more than a year to date after a bad breakup, much less the death of someone they planned to spend the rest of their life with. OP (and this therapist) needs to let this man heal and move at his own pace.", "Honestly I can't fault the therapist, he is seeking help, this is the therapists advice. \n\nOP is the asshole tho", "He\u2019s paying for that therapist.  He brought her into it.  If she agrees with the therapist, then how is that being TA?  She\u2019s giving him her honest feedback.  Now, if she inserted herself against his will, then I agree.  But I don\u2019t see that here.", ">A therapists job is to help their client get to a life worth living, with their own goals. Not what the therapist thinks he should do.\n\nYes! Therapists aren't supposed to straight up give advice like this. They're supposed to provide a sounding board and help the client process in a non-directive way. Of course there are bad therapists, and therapists who are off their game, but I also wonder if the brother *said* the therapist said this when the therapist didn't actually say it.", "> but unless you have buried a spouse, you have no clue what he is going through\n\nEven if he does, he still has no clue. Grieving is different for everyone.", "This. Like, join an amateur sports team. Take a cooking class. Start a board game night. Like, the solution to his self isolation is not to push him into a romantic relationship before he's ready, it's just... Make sure he stays connected with the world and the people still in it. By being there for him.", "Very well said!", "Or he won\u2019t and that\u2019s ok too. If he doesn\u2019t want to date he shouldn\u2019t be expected to eventually, just because it\u2019s common.", "Came here to comment this. Losing a partner is not like a break up, and it's reasonable to think a little over a year is not long enough for him to process everything and be open to dating again. Soft YTA, because of good intentions, but poor execution.\n\nMaybe invite him to hang out with you and your friends, op. He'll be socializing, and still respecting his time in the dating aspect.", "The therapist shouldn\u2019t be applying peer pressure to him either and impact matters more than intent.", "I'd agree, worse even is that therapist has been pushing for 4 months.\n\nThe guy will date when he's ready, even if he says he never wants to date again, most likely his feelings will change with time. Regardless, he shouldn't being pushed/pulled either way after so little time.", "Advice is...you should think about dating, not 4 months of 'convincing' the client after he's rejected the idea.", ">If she agrees with the therapist, then how is that being TA?\n\nBc the therapist should not be pushing him, let alone for 4 months, to date if he's not ready for it or aimply doean't want to. Getting back into the dating world is not necessary for him to continue healing. If the therapist is worried about his social life, then they should be suggesting he focus on familial amd friendship relationships.", "Being told a change will make things better is fine and all, but not everyone is always in an emotional position to act on that. Dude ain't ready, saying he needs to date isn't gonna change that", "That is absolutely true! I should have said that grief is different for everyone.", "Op wasn't just talking about dating though, he was talking about a social life, which is healthy to have whether it's all just platonic or not and will happen when he is ready to.", "I don't know how the therapist is dealing with the subject, and neither do you. Therefore trying to judge how the therapist is saying he should date is not possible, nor relevant to the post.", "That the therapist is pushing at all, so soon *and* after they've been told it's unwelcome, is a problem."]}
