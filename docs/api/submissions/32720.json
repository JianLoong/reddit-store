That's a terrible plan, and it doesn't matter the breed, any dog might be at risk of snapping in a situation like that.

Furthermore, 'pitbull' is actually a blanket term for several different breeds of dogs, including the American Pit Bull Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the American Bully, but many mutts and mixed breeds are often incorrectly identified as 'pitbulls' when they don't share any genetic lineage with them, or when they are mixed breed, meaning that we ought to also count whatever they're mixed with, but often don't.

The first story I seen of a out bull killing someone, it was a kid but the kid had been throwing rocks at the poor dog. The dog was still put down but the parents of the kid lost their lawsuit for against the owners. So yes there maybe lots of dog attacks and maybe even deadly attacks, but does these statistics include the number of attacks caused by abuse by owners or someone harassing the dogs?

It's true that I linked to a pro-pitbull site, but if you follow the hyperlinks to the actual studies (sometimes it takes a couple of clicks) you'll find numerous peer-reviewed studies confirming that even professionals have a hard time identifying pitbulls, and often misclassify dogs with less than 50% or even no genetic match to the four recognized breeds of pitbulls, so dogsbite could easily be misidentifying those dogs, if they don't show any effort to verify their data through genetic testing. (Furthermore, if we're talking about bias, dogsbite also predominantly uses its platform to lobby for breed-specific legislation against pitbulls, so don't act like using a lobbying group as a jumping-off point for research is disqualifying.)\n\nFurthermore, this whole argument depends on a logical fallacy: Even if pitbulls are responsible for the majority of fatal dog attacks, there are so few fatal dog attacks annually that the odds of dying from a dog attack from any breed is 1 in 118,776. The vast majority of pitbulls will never be involved in an attack, just like the vast majority of dogs will never be involved in an attack.\n\nETA: Actually, here's a [link](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2017-11-15/dangerous-dog-debate) to an article about the founder of dogsbite from the American Veterinary Medical Association."]}
