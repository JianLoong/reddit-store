And calling you selfish for not wanting to be separated from a car that you actually like and take good care of. \nI don\u2019t think you are selfish OP, but your mum is certainly cheap because by forcing you to save your money to buy yourself a newer car and your sister ending up getting your car for free, your mum spends no money with this deal.

I fear there is more that she doesn't tell you. Does she ask you to leave the car home in these next 4 years?\nMaybe she can't afford a car herself and would like to use your meanwhile you are attending college?", "Your mom's an AH. What right does she have to give away something that's not even hers. \n\nDon't cave. Its YOUR CAR. She can't do anything about it.

Are you sure your mom doesn\u2019t want you to leave it behind so she can use it?", "NTA. Also don't listen to people who say \"Your car won't even be running then because it's 20 years old.\" My car is 19 years old and no issues with it. Just take good care of it, change oil, take it to shop for maintenance etc. Obviously some parts need to be changed every now and then but that happens even with newer cars.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t want the car for your sister she wants it for herself. Sister can\u2019t drive so while it\u2019s there \u2018waiting for her\u2019 the mom will use it to take her places", "NTA.

Whoever that is owns the car.  If your aunt has properly transferred the title to you, it\u2019s yours and you can do with it what you want.

Best would be to just be vague about it until the time comes.  Good luck.", "NTA because it\u2019s your car but really? The car will be 20 years old by then.

Your mom can't force it.

OP is going off to college soon and not everyone returns to their home town after graduating. Plus sister will need a car when she\u2019s learning to drive in 3 years, and you can\u2019t split a car for things like driving classes if you\u2019re going to a university in another city or state.", "They shared family vehicles? Or they shared their own personally owned ones? On demand?", "Because she's posting about this four years too soon and in four years this car will be worth about $50.", "The car is already 16 years old. It will be 20+ years old before the sister is driving. A 12 year old vehicle isn\u2019t comparable to a 20 year old vehicle.", "I said it\u2019s okay to share a car with a sibling in general.", "You said \u201cI also don\u2019t see the problem with sharing.\u201d Not \u201cin general\u201d - so I was addressing OP\u2019s specific situation."]}
