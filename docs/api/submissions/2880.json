Also don't listen to people who say \"Your car won't even be running then because it's 20 years old.\" My car is 19 years old and no issues with it. Just take good care of it, change oil, take it to shop for maintenance etc. Obviously some parts need to be changed every now and then but that happens even with newer cars.", "NTA.

Best would be to just be vague about it until the time comes.  Good luck.", "NTA because it\u2019s your car but really? The car will be 20 years old by then.

You\u2019ll be done with college, and moving on, by the time your sister is ready to drive.", "NTA. It your car. Do not help pay for a car for your sister. You are not her parent and that is not your responsibility. Your parents are just trying not to pay money.", "She has no right. I hope you have the title in your name.", "NTA", "Why\u2019s this here? You and your sister agree, it\u2019s none of mom\u2019s business anymore.", "NTA but this isn\u2019t worthy of being upset over.  Your mom can\u2019t give away something that belongs to you, esp a car which would involve you legally signing it over to the next owner.  Also your sister\u2019s only 12 and doesn\u2019t even want the car.   All ofyour lives will be completely different in four years.   Your car may not even be running by then.", "Ok. It\u2019s at least 4 yrs away. Tell mom \u201cwhatever\u201d & take the car. You\u2019ll be close to finishing college by the time sister will need a car. \n\nThis isn\u2019t something you should be dealing with or arguing about right now. The car might not even be functioning in 4 yrs.", "NTA it's your car. It was a gift from someone to you, and it wasn't from her.\n\nProbably what you can do is just ignore these weird requests for shit in the future and let your future adult self ignore it then too. This is going to be a non-issue. Don't make a big deal about it. if she says anything more going forward just make a joke about how much of a piece of shit it is and how she wont want it anyway and move on with your life.", "Nta you should start watching out because your mom seems manipulative and it seems she wants to take advantage of the situation which probably means she is toxic in other areas as well", "Hey Aunt, thanks for the car, but could you take ownership and arrange payments - i\\`ll reimburse you - my mother wants to force me to give up the car for sister in 4 years - and she can\\`t if you own it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA Your mom is. She's looking at putting the burden of your sister's car entirely on you so that she doesn't have to do anything. IF she wants your sister to have a car she can give your sister a car she's the mom not you.", "NTA", "NTA I don\u2019t even get why your mom is bringing this up now when she can\u2019t drive for another 4 years? Plus you\u2019re the one who pays for all the maintenance on it. Is the car in your name?", "Especially considering she\u2019s not the one who paid for it", "Maybe but I get the feeling it's more Mom getting to act like she got her 2nd daughter a car without having to actually pony up and get 2nd sister a car.", "Just say yes. Your sister driving is 4 years away, minimum. This discussion won\u2019t matter when you have already driven far,far away in it. In the meantime, you ask for help with all upkeep because it needs to stay in good condition for little sis!", "Your mom just doesn't want to spend money on something she can practically steal from you", "NTA, y'all are fighting over what's going to happen to an already old car four years from now? Am I reading this right?", "NTA Why can't little sister drive mom's car? Is it because mom knows that little sister might not take care of it, and even if she does, the insurance will go up to cover an underaged driver? It's not her car, it's not her choice who you let use it.", "This is a future problem. It's all moot for at least 3-4 years. Who knows. The motor could go out or any other number of things before that time comes. Best way to deal with this in the present is just to give a non committed response like \"maybe\" or \"we'll see when the time comes\" and let it drop. \n\nNTA as it is your car that your aunt gave to you.", "NTA. It was gifted to you and not your sister. Beyond that your sister is 12, no where near driving so why did your mom even brought it up.", "Just stop even fighting about it. Your sister is 12. Let your mom make all the plans she wants for your car. Then do what you want. You\u2019ll be 22 and not under your mom\u2019s thumb. \nSo stop arguing about it. Say \u201cwhatever\u201d and roll your eyes and do whatever the hell you want. \nNTA", "NTA, it's your car ... and your sister is 12", "Second. Had a friend that bought a truck in high school, fixed it up, and his dad was able to sell it out from under him because he was a minor and couldn't have the title in his own name. Never saw a penny back from it or even an apology. Some parents you can NOT trust with a major piece of personal property.", "I feel you. My 2006 Chevy is held together with duct tape and will power.", "I don't know, entitled people can have long memories, and the temporary relief of humoring her now might make it a much bigger argument down the line when she expects OP to keep her word.", "You underestimate the willingness of some people to forge signatures. If mom feels entitled to OP's property she maybe willing to take that matter into her own hands.", "She got out of buying for one, guess she's hoping for miracle number two?", "And probably making a rift between the sisters for no reason, too. Younger sister will be made promises that mom knows OP doesn't agree to, then twist it to make OP the bad guy. Now both sisters are upset and probably resenting each other.", "Let's do the math.  Your sister is 12 and won't be able to drive for at least 4 years.  You'll be 22.  Will the car be in your name?  If so you'll be an adult, it's your property, you just tell your mother no.  NTA.   \n\nMake sure to get it in your name.  Tell your mother you need it to get a lower insurance rate or pay your car license fees or whatever.", "And is mom going to give you her car at that point? No? Why is she being so unfair?? NTA", "Nta - sounds like Mom doesn\u2019t want to buy your sister a car.", "INFO:\nhow many miles were on the car when your aunt gave it to you?", "I think there\u2019s a \u201coh and you should leave the car here so your sister can learn\u201d coming up in the next couple of years, should OP fall for the current demand.", "Or Mom is just controlling and used to making decisions like this and having minors who have to go along with it.  Maybe over the next four years she'll come to realize OP is an adult.  I'd just respond \"who knows if it will even be still running\" and not play her game right now.", "Yep. Mom is going down the \u201cit\u2019s really a family car\u201d path. Sis is 12 and OP will be mostly done with college by the time sis is old enough to drive solo. There\u2019s no point in pushing this argument now if it\u2019s not going to be followed up with pushing for OP to leave the car behind so \u201cyour sister can learn on it\u201d. \n\nAunt likely knew what she was doing in giving OP this car now.", "Nope nope nope, I used to have a 2007 Mazda speed 3 and I'll never stop regretting getting rid of it. Those cars are awesome!", "Awfully generous of your mother to be giving away your stuff.\n\nNTA.", "It is your car. It doesn't matter what your mom wants. \n\nYour sister is 12? She won't even be driving for 3 or 4 more years. \n\nIn 4 years you probably won't live at home anymore. You may not even have this car anymore.  The car is legally yours, you'll be 21 or 22 and your mom may have an opinion but she has no power to do anything with your car. \n\nThis will probably resolve itself and in 3 or 4 years this won't even come up again.", "NTA Your an adult now, your mother doesn\u2019t have a say in everything you do. Even after you tried to reason with her and make a compromise, she still insisted you give your car to your sister, who doesn\u2019t even like it. Your mom is the asshole, not you.\n\nEdit: The car was a gift from your aunt. Who\u2019s to say that your aunt won\u2019t give your sister a car too. It will be a few years so she can start saving now.", "NTA. Whose name is the car under? If it is not your name, you need to change that asap", "You\u2019re stressing about a fight that\u2019s 4+ years away. There\u2019s no need too.", "NTA.\nAnd, what exactly is wrong with your mother? Does she not have real problems she needs ro deal with, that she has to make up bullshit ones? It's years before your sister is going to need a car.", "NTA. \n\nI don't understand why your mom is even making this an issue. Your sister has at least 4 years before she can legally  drive on her own. Anything can happen to an already aging car in that time even if you do agree to give it to her. \n\nTell your mom that if the car is still running when you're ready to get a new one, you'll be happy to sell it to her, as is,  for trade-in value."]}
