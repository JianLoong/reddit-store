We live in one state in Europe but my bf is from other country in Europe. We live in flat I own  (bought when I was 22) and has bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and small hall.\n\nI and his mum don't really like each other. I am oncologist while she is very alternative and is persuaded I have really bad aura because I am in contact with ill and dying people all day and I am carrying the suffering with me everywhere. She is also persuaded we are poisoning the patients with all the meds/chemicals/radiation and basically killing them. She only believes in herbal products. That's the main reason of our conflict. \n\nNow to the story. My bf's mother called and said she would like to visit. I told him I am okay with it as long as she books the hotel and stays in hotel because we don't have enough space for her. (In the bedroom we have just our bed and few shelves and big carpet in the corner where I like to lay down and read. He told me she does not want to stay in hotel because she is scared there alone, she does not speak English nor my language and she wants to stay with us. We got into an argument and I told him that it's not an option for me for her to stay with us since we don't have the space. He offered to buy spreadable mattress for her and I still said no because I get up really early for work and I want my peace. He got mad and told me it's his mother and that he wants to see her. I offered to send them to some hotel outside of our city because we have really good offers for medical workers but she doesn't want that because she doesn't have money for that. I didn't want to argue so I said I am going to leave for that week to my parents, will be driving to work from different city and they can do whatever they want here. Now my bf is pissed that I won't be there to welcome his mother.\n\nAlso if it's worth mentioning he paid for her flight tickets because she didn't have budget for it. And got angry when I asked how can she travel if she has no money?\n\nSo Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1690974170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g5vyc/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mil_in_my_flat/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not ok that you had to leave your home. He needs to stay at a hotel with her.", "NTA \n\nshe verbalized her disrespect for your profession and even thinks badly of your aura - which is important to her and she gives it a meaning so I would say in her dictionary she's basically dissing you t your face as well, so why would you be friendly with her?\n\nAnd if you don't like each other expecting you to be with her in a 1bedroom apartment is unrealistic. Now it is worth considering if this should be your future in-law or any form of a constant in your life for the years to come as your BF will probably never stop catering to his mother's wishes. I think it is an absolutely valid aspect to evaluate in your relationship. I know it's 7 years but still...she thinks you poison your patience on purpose", "NTA, you have no space and I would not want to share my living space with someone who holds medieval ideas of aura not to mention modern medicine.\nYour boyfriend could seen her regularly even if she is staying in a hotel.", "NTA.  You have boundaries that MIL doesn't respect.  Why should you deal with it in your own home?  Nope.", "NTA , he can pay for her hotel and stay there with her. You bought your home.", "It's understandable that you don't want your MIL to stay in your flat due to the conflict and lack of space. It's also reasonable for you to prioritize your work and peace, especially given the demanding nature of your job. \n\nIt's unfortunate that your boyfriend is unable to understand your perspective and is insisting on his mother staying with you despite the space limitations. It's also concerning that he paid for her flight tickets even though she didn't have the money for it and is getting upset with you for not welcoming his mother.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns and boundaries. You can try to find a compromise that works for both parties, such as finding alternative accommodation or setting clear boundaries for your MIL's stay. Ultimately, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and needs, and it's okay to say no if you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed", "NTA.  Not enough space means not enough space.  MIL stays in a hotel.  End of story.", "NTA at all\n\nThat woman brazenly disrespects you. You have every right to not allow her to come over. Funny thing about these \u2018alternative medicine\u2019 people\u2026 they say they cure SO DAMN MUCH but rarely ever prove the patients in question were ever sick to begin with. Look at Belle Gibson.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is the AH, as he is ignoring the difficulties his mother creates for you and trying to force her stay down your throat.\n\nJust the notion that he wants you to \"welcome\" someone you can't stand is pure mama's boy thinking.\n\nYou don't' just have a MIL problem.", "Nta.your bf sure is though. Do you really need to remind him it's YOUR flat?", "NTA at all. \n\nYou don\u2019t have the space, and she\u2019s not nice to you anyway. If she were that spiritual she\u2019d know not to insult you and your aura like that", "NTA. I cannot for the life of me understand these dudes that would rather spend time with their mommy than their SO, it's pathetic.", "NTA - can you stay the first night or comeback for the last one? Means you can prove your point and also you are making an effort to see her/be there for him.", "NTA. Having overnight guests is a two yeses one no situation. If one says no, it's a no. I don't care who the guest is. You both sleep there, you each get veto power.", "NTA. However, the fact you own the flat in this instance isnt relevant.  My husband pays our rent so does that mean I have no say over what happens in our home?\n\nHaving said the above. your m-i-l clearly doesn't respect you or even like you so I think you are well within your rights to not want her there especially for an extended visit. Added to that is the space issue, there simply isn't enough room. So she should stay in hotel and so can your bf. He needs to stand up to her and support you imo. Uou are the one he shares his life with, he really should have your back.\n\nMy mil has been unpleasant to me many times but the one time she really overstepped and behaved appalingly my then bf (now husbanmd)  called her out (in public) and supported me when she phoned up crying and playing the victim (after the event). Generally as she is not a very nice person we just ignore it but the one time it really mattered he was there for me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if it was I bet you a pound to a penny she will do nothing but talk big pharma conspiracy theory crap all the time she is there.  She wants to visit and see her son? Fine.  You've made a sensible decision to vacate for that week so that there is enough room.  I don't see your boyfriend's problem.", "Depends on the country your bf comes from.\n I have a bicultural background. In one of them, your reasoning is perfectly normal and okay. In the other one, you'd be insulting visitors immensely if you'd say there is no room for them. Giving up your own bed and sleep om the floor yourself would be normal, especially when the visitor is a parent. \nSince you chose to be with a man from a different background, both of you need to compomise. \nI personally think your solution is avalid compomise, although I'd say you should be there to welcome her on het day of arrival. \nDon't forget that you'll be met with the same hospitality when you'll visit his family in the future.", "I refuse to be insulted in my own home, so I really dont want go meet her. Also she requires quite while she sleeps and I get up extremely early because the week she s gonna be here I work morning shifts.", "I went to visit his family twice, but his mother kept insulting me every time I came. She also tried to cure my celiakia by feeling me pickled Peppers only for almost two weeks and took huge offense when I went out to buy some food. \nSince then he is going there alone and I refuse to visit his family.", "Totally get where you are coming from. I was just wondering if you did one night at the start or at the end would it prove you right and stop it from happening again? Or has your boyfriend said what he imagines happening in the future if she wants to visit?", "Sorry to hear this! And makes it understandable why you aren't thrilled to see her; I wouldn't be either. \nMust be hard for your bf to be caught in the middle...", "Well she did visit once since we live together and slept on the sofa (before we got rid of it before reconstruction). It was horrible, she hated everything I cook, she demanded lights off before 9 (I wanted to study because I was still in school) and one day I had horrible cramps and wanted to lay down in bed because I felt nauseous, in pain, w/e. We were supposed to go to my parents to visit, my mum cooked for her typical national food and she made a sceen that she is not going anywhere because I made her feel unwelcomed and cried. \n\nSo since then I shut it down everytime my bf wanted to invite her over or she wanted to come and told him to go visit her but now she insisted on coming because she wanted to do some trips around our city and wanted to use our flat as headquarters. In future hopefully we will have bigger flat and have a guest room and I won't have to deal with her much.", "Why are YOU leaving the apartment YOU own???", "NTA. Tell her your apartment is overflowing with your aura.", "NTA. But i think you should clue him in that the second (more important) reason that you and her just do not like each other. You dont want to put a wedge between him and her, but you do not want to see her. \nI think it is a good compromise then when you do. Just tell him where you stand, but you dont expect him to choose or stgh like that. I mean she vasically accussed you of murdering, of course you do not like each other.", "If your MIL can't stand your aura, it's perfectly considerate of you to spare her the experience of it by moving to a hotel. The main issue is your bf excusing the way his mom denigrates you and expects you to 'welcome' her regardless and put up with her bullshit instead of him telling her to respect you. NTA.", "NTA", "It's your place and he just lives there he doesn't get to dictate and tell you who can and cannot visit if you feel uncomfortable you get a right to say no if he doesn't like it, he can get a hotel room with his mother", "NTA", "You are saving your sanity.\n\nYour flat is small.  Add another person and you will be living on top of one another.  That is a very uncomfortable situation when you don't get along.\n\nYour right to privacy is not gong to be respected.\n\nThe offer of a hotel outside of the city sounds very generous.  BF should have accepted it.\n\nBF could have traveled home if he wanted to see his mother.\n\nI hope you have nice week with your parents.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's your flat - bottom line. If he has the money to get her flight, he has the money to get a hotel and he can stay there with her. Also, ain't NO WAY I would be pushed out of my home to make someone else comfortable. Sorry.", "Hide or lock up anything you don't want her to see or find because you KNOW she's going to be going through all of your stuff while you are gone.", "You own this apartment. Under no circumstances should you let him and his mother drive you from your home. Lose the boyfriend. He doesn't care about you.", "NTA. Why on earth would you want to stay home under those circumstances. And you know that you and bf would be sleeping on the mattress on the floor. MIL would have the bed because she is \"Mom\" and older. Enjoy your break and the nice visit with your family. Get together with BF and MIL for a meal. That should be enough. LOL", "NTA- No matter what the circumstances, houseguests are a 2 yes/1 no rule.\n\nBesides, you are awesome! You are out there fighting cancer and supporting patients who are living with it. I can't imagine how difficult your work is, both intellectually and emotionally. Anyone who disrespects what you do is unworthy of your time", "NTA and you should NOT have to leave your home for his mother.\n\nIf he wants her to visit, he can pay for a hotel for the pair of them.", "NTA but seriously why are you with your bf? The fact that he is willing to put his mum's needs above your comfort shows he is not emotional matured and expecting you to welcome his mum is beyond ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThey need you in the house to pay for things like groceries and take out. How dare you move out and leave them to pay for stuff?", "NTA, why would she want to stay in a flat that is saturated with bad vibes? \n\nYou've been with your BF a long time, what's going to happen, in the future, when he needs to take care of his mother when her health declines? He will probably want to move her in. She treats you like crap and will probably continue to for the rest of her life. Are you okay with that?", "NTA rethink your relationship with your boyfriend.", "This.  I can't imagine anyone saying I want to come visit, versus you should come visit me, when they have no money for the trip and literally anything.  I realize OP did the next best thing but I think I would literally be the worst host I could possibly for the week.", "Even if they co-owned the flat, houseguests should be two yeses/one no", "NTA! MIL\u2019s and family that don\u2019t respect boundaries or expect things, don\u2019t need to darken your doorstep. If she can\u2019t afford her flight, why is she traveling??? She needs to stay her ass home and pick up a phone!", "NTA, now think about this drama if you guys was married.  time to cut bait and give him the boot.", "NTA\n\nThe timing is problematic. She called wanting to visit - at what point between that and talking to you about his mom's visit and letting her stay did he pay for her ticket? Sounds like he is trying to guilt you into putting MIL up by buying her ticket for her.\n\nI think first and foremost, you've got a bf problem."]}
