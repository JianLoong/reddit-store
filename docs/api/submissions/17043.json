Rather than the adult that you are. \n\nTo be honest if this was me, I'd be contacting the cousin directly and saying in the politest way possible that you won't be able to sit and babysit during the meal because you have things you'd like to discuss with family or I'd tell your mother that you won't be going full stop.", "NTA.  It's sad your mom doesn't give a damn whether you can enjoy an evening out. There's something very wrong with that attitude", "NTA. You want to enjoy your dad\u2019s birthday and the fancy meal in peace. If your cousin and his spouse do as well, they need to hire a babysitter for the evening. \n\nBut what\u2019s your plan? In all likelihood they\u2019re going to just stick the fussy kid next to you anyway as a way to force you to entertain him all evening. How are you going to avoid that?\n\nI hope you provide an update on how it goes.", "NTA I\u2019d show up hand dad his gift and leave. Or whisper to wait staff  for a Togo box get your food then leave .", "NTA, I\u2019ve been pressured in situations like this and you have to remember she is being the asshole, she just wants you to feel like you\u2019re being the asshole. I love to be petty so I\u2019d have probably told mom, \u201cthe puzzle is a great idea! The child will really enjoy doing the puzzle with you!\u201d Cause you didn\u2019t volunteer for anything.", "NTA. They tried to get you to babysit because you're a woman.", "So because they want to eat in peace you have to sacrifice your night celebrating your dad's birthday? Who you probably don't see too often?\n\nShould've told them to pay you if they wanted you to babysit. Or what's even better, should've told your mom to do the babysitting instead.", "NTA - when will parents learn, their need for a break are their responsibility, not other family members.", "Why doesn't she watch the kid for just a few hours? Oh, wait, because she wants to enjoy herself? And you're not supposed to? Personally I'd rather not go than be stuck being the designated babysitter. NTA", "NTA. Quote her the FU price for babysitting. \u201cYou want me to sit next to that little booger factory? $100 per hour, parents provide all meals and food per-cut or pre-chewed, and I don\u2019t do diapers. If that kid needs a change, he sits in it all night until it\u2019s time to leave.\u201d", "NTA. They made this great invention for parents who want to eat in peace: the babysitter. Otherwise, they chose to have the kids, they don't get to just push them off on someone else when they want a break. Some people just don't like to be around kids, and that is cool. You should not be expected to give up your peace and quiet to look after the kids of irresponsible parents. Shame on your mom for even thinking it was ok to put you in this situation. If she felt so strongly about it, what is stopping her from watching the kiddos? At minimum I would have said fine, my rate is 40.00 per kid per hour, payable up front. Honestly, good on you for sticking up for yourself!", "NTA - you\u2019re being voluntold.\n\nTell her no. Just as they\u2019d like to enjoy dinner, so would you. And that includes being a part of the conversation, not babysitting.\n\nIf it was such a big deal for your cousin and his wife to have the night off, your mom is good deed should have been finding and paying for a babysitter for them. Not volunteering you when you\u2019re also invited to the party.", "Why is your mom trying to micromanage this? Your cousin can take care of his own kids. He\u2019s there, he can do it with his wife. If they need or want a break, they can hire a babysitter. You\u2019re not the default just because you\u2019re a single female.\n\nYour mom is the AH. You\u2019re NTA", "NTA. If they want peace get an actual babysitter.", "NTA and make it clear to your cousin, text her or call her, before the dinner, that you WILL NOT be watching her child. If they try to make it happen get up and move away and tell them their child is not your responsibility. Don\u2019t sit back down until your seat is moved.  BTW I\u2019m petty I\u2019d tell your dad that you wish you could spend his birthday with him but your mother has ruined it with the baby sitting, so  he/she can fix it or you\u2019ll celebrate with him later. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019ll be fixed pronto!", "NTA - a child is the parents' responsibility, and if they can't look after the child, they need to get someone to freely agree to take care of the child on their behalf - pay someone if they have to. Pressuring you into looking after a child is not a great move on your mom's part, trying to make you sit next to the child so you'd just happen to have to look after him should the need arise is kind of irresponsible and an asshole move.", "Volunteer your mom for babysitting duty. When she refuses, say she is embarrassing you and being selfish.", "NTA. If she was asking you to sit with them for a little while, it would be different. But she wants you to give up your entire evening. That is not your job. Their parents need to either get a sitter or take turns parenting through kids.", "NTA.  IF the parents want to \"eat in peace\", they should hire a babysitter.  I am sure you would like to eat in peace as well.  It is a party for your dad, not something that you would not want to participate in.", "Sure, I'll do it mom; for $50.", "Everyone is making good points about OP\u2019s mother volunteering her so mother would look good. However op really needs to address the fact that her mother was willing to sacrifice her to the point where she would not be a part of the conversation. She wasn\u2019t treating a college student as an adult. At least not an adult who she wanted to be part of the conversation. It was OP\u2019s father\u2019s birthday! She wanted to be treated like an equal, not someone who was expendable to the dynamic.", "Guess whose responsibility it is to watch the kid? The parents. Whenever people try this on me I always tell them I don't have kids for a reason. If I wanted to watch a kid I'd have my own.", "NTA", "agreed...also this is a pretty damn key \"few hours\"... OP was probably looking forward to visiting with other adults, and this is OP's FATHER'S event...the \"distant relatives\" can manage without the nuclear family of the honoree's attention.\n\nMom wanted the \"brownie parent points\" and can now dine on her disappointment...or do a jigsaw puzzle with a toddler herself.", "If this is a fancy restaurant, why doesn't the cousin get a baby sitter for these 2 children? I think the restaurant would appreciate it.\n\nOther people in the restaurant would also appreciate not having to small children at this fancy restaurant.", "Also, it's a fancy restaurant. Maybe get a baby sitter?", "\u201cWe want to eat in peace but screw everyone else at the restaurant!\u201d \n\nToddlers don\u2019t belong at fancy restaurants, especially if their parents can\u2019t be bothered to actually parent them.", "It also sounds like that 3 year old knows OP least out of all of the people at the table, the child would be more comfortable interacting with his parents, his grandparents, or any of the local family members than the one stranger who isn't even comfortable around toddlers. This sounds like a recipe for a tantrum and an uncomfortable dinner for everyone.\n\nMy money says OP's mom thinks that spending a couple of hours playing with a toddler will make OP want kids of her own and this is a ploy for acquiring grandchildren. It will backfire.", "Yes! If OP were a son and not a daughter this would be a non issue!", "Not for long.  A 3 yr old will be interested in a puzzle for maybe two minutes.  Especially since their motor skills mean large puzzle pieces unless mom is more than clueless and got a regular puzzle whose pieces will get tossed around in boredom.  That kid is going to be bored and ask for chicken nuggets.", "I have strong feeling this was caused by mother only, you know, \"i am not sure we could attend with two small children\" - \"nonsence, my daughter will be happy to babysit them for you, she loves children!\" type of convo, so they can be fully under impression they don't *need* a sitter, bc OP volunteered.", "OP is a woman.", "Mmm hmm, exactly. At 10-13, I probably would have loved hanging out with a 3 year old in those circumstances. Brought some crayons and books for the kid. Tolerated it as a slightly older teen, especially if I\u2019m getting paid. 21? Not a goddamn chance.", "It doesn't sound like it was the cousin's idea. More like Mom trying to play gracious host by volunteering her daughter.", "I have a feeling no one is going to be eating in peace with a small child in a nice place.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "honestly i don't know if she wants grandkids, she never brought it up. and i never brought it up that i'm childfree. my parents have a lot of childless/childfree friends and my aunt and her bf also don't have children. i've never heard my parents say anything negative about that", "This is for mom to look good. She volunteers you, she wins family points with zero effort.  You have the higher place in pecking order being your dad\u2019s child.  I lived with this crap for way too long. You are not selfish. If they needed a babysitter they should have paid for one at home", "that\u2019s what i was thinking! why is a 6 month old and a 3 year old going to a fancy restaurant??", "A toddler with a jigsaw puzzle at the table in a fancy restaurant. Let's not leave out that bit.", "> Toddlers don\u2019t belong at fancy restaurants, especially if their parents can\u2019t be bothered to actually parent them.   \n   \nNo argument at the second portion of your statement, but if they\u2019re not being disruptive, and the parents are being attentive I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an issue.    \n   \nWe brought our 2yo to an early dinner with family at Craft while in NYC. They were content to color (with crayons provided by the restaurant) and play with other quiet toys (sticker book, pop-its, etc.) that we\u2019d packed until the food arrived. Then they chowed down on the shared risotto/gnocchi along with food from our plates. We weren\u2019t able to stay for dessert and drink with the rest of the group because we could tell our toddler was ready to leave, but they never disrupted anyone\u2019s meal by yelling/crying/screaming.", "I agree \ud83d\udcaf.", "That line made me laugh. One puzzle. For a three year old. To keep him occupied for what will likely be a multi-hour meal? Yeah, that\u2019s going to go well.", "I retract my assumption then and apologize for assuming.", "Yes, I was like, this is her father's birthday and yet apparently the cousins are more important?!", "Your second sentence nails it.  Mom can take over if she feels someone needs to take over.", "I have no problem with quiet children or parents that remove their children as soon as they become disruptive. Unfortunately most parents are not like you and don\u2019t prepare their children for these situations or remove them when they become disruptive. The sudden shrieking is what really gets me, sends me into fight or flight. Since it is often a happy noise some people tend not to think it\u2019s not disruptive.", "I can only assume most of those pieces are going to end up on the ground as well", "Especially since it will likely go past the child\u2019s bedtime so they\u2019ll have a cranky 3 year old to deal with.", "Totally fair points", "Or, counterpoint,  you don't notice all the parents that are like the user you're replying to because they're slipping under the Rader as intended, and thus the badly behaved ones are having a greater effect."]}
