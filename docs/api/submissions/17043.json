If your mother wanted your cousin and his wife to get a night off, she should have hired an actual sitter or done it herself, not voluntold you to do it.", "NTA. Wow. Two parents and a fancy dinner. Why can't your cousin and his wife get a babysitter for the night? Why are you being singled out to watch the child? Because you are the youngest there besides the children? Because you are a woman? \"IT JUST IS\" that's sexist.\n\nYou are an adult and deserve to enjoy the dinner for your fathers birthday just as much as anyone else there. Tell your mom this and ask her why doesn't she help with the toddler.\n\nYour mom is being unfair and she is wrong.

You aren\u2019t a built in babysitter.", "NTA- She is giving you a sit s the kids table crap. You've enjoyed your life and should be able to sit with the rest of the adults to indulge and share.

Stick to your guns and enjoy yourself.", "I'm so confused. NTA obviously, but why don't they just get a babysitter? Why do they need to make multiple people miserable to save the tiniest amount of money?", "NTA.

No one has stopped to consider that your father, who you are there to celebrate, might want to be near his own daughter. Doesn't your father want to catch up with you? In that case, go right past your Mom amd Cousins and tell him about this nonsense and he can use birthday boy powers to end it.\n\nBut wow. Four people talking about seating arrangements at a man's birthday dinner and not one of them thought about the man's preference.", "NTA. You have a right to enjoy the fancy meal and the celebration of your own father like everyone else. \nThese children are not your responsibility.  And saying, \u201cIt just is\u201d is not a reason. It\u2019s just repeating that she\u2019s making it your job.\n\nIf this winds up forced upon you, I would ignore the kids and show incompetence. The parents will need to take over.

Because if it was her cousins idea it seems he would have asked OP.

I'm sure dad would want to catch up with his son on his birthday. Your mom isn't thinking this through. Just because you are younger doesn't make you the designated baby sitter. The kids won't have fun at the fancy dinner and should stay home with a sitter.", "NTA: If your cousin and his wife want a night without kids they need to hire a babysitter. Why is it more important that they celebrate your father's birthday but you don't?", "NTA if you don\u2019t want to than don\u2019t and if they try to make you excuse yourself and go to bar bathroom elsewhere\u2026 speak up for yourself you are an adult.", "NTA.  It's your dad's birthday.  You are there to celebebrate his birthday.\n\nNot your cousin.  Or your cousin's wife.  Or even your cousins's dad.  Your dad.\n\nI would suggest you say to your mom, that she's being selfish.  You don't get to see your dad that often, and she's trying to saddle you with babysitting while you can.

No is a full sentence, and it means no.\" NTA", "NTA. Would be willing to bet cash money that your mother rikd your cousin you'd love to mind their child. Now she's guiltily you into doing it so it doesn't reflect badly on her to your cousins. She doesn't care that it reflects badly on you.", "NTA Your cousin's children are not your responsibility. If babysitting is necessary then they need to hire a babysitter. If anyone is being selfish it's your mother. And if your cousin is in on it then they're being selfish as well.", "NTA If your mother is so invested in your cousin and his wife being able to eat in peace for a change, she should sit next to the 3-year-old and entertain him herself.  If she really needs to help them out, perhaps she could also hold the baby.  And take them to the car when they make a disturbance in the fancy Italian ristorante.  Or perhaps offer to pay for a babysitter to spare the rest of the fancy diners...", "What an odd thing for her to be invested in, it's extremely standard for parents (or grandparents) to mind children at dinners. Not cousins.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your cousin\u2019s child is not your child. Therefore, child care is not your responsibility. \n\nYou are 21. You are definitely an adult.

Luckily my mum has always stood on my side so I\u2019m sorry yours is not, but your fully within your right to say no. I always tell them \u2018I don\u2019t have kids for a reason and I certainly don\u2019t want yours", "NTA. If your mom feels so strongly about this, SHE can watch the child for a few hours so the parents can eat in peace. Sounds like she volunteered you without asking and she\u2019s embarrassed to admit it. Any chance cousin can get a babysitter that night? I have no objection to children in restaurants (my husband and I take our 8 month old twins out almost every week), but a fancy Italian restaurant doesn\u2019t sound very family friendly.", "NTA, but I will say this. You seem selfish in a small way.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nThis is for YOUR dad. Make sure you don't sit next to the kid.", "NTA.  I wish people understood that none of their relatives automatically become synonymous with \u201cobligatory free babysitter\u201d as soon as they start a family.  \n\nI also don't understand the logic of your cousin wanting to \u201ceat in peace for once\u201d, yet have their children come with them to a restaurant anyway.  They should hire a babysitter and leave the kids at home if peace is what they desire so much for that evening.", "NTA\n\nYou not wanting to is good enough reason. But also. It's HARD to babysit a kid who you don't have a relationship with. Kids get all kinds of \"you're not in charge of me\" if they think they can get away with it, and won't listen to a stranger.", "NTA \n\n\u201cMom. It\u2019s simple.

I think it's a fear thing more than a money thing.", "it's OP's father's birthday, not hers. in any event she shouldn't be saddled with this ridiculous task. OP if i were you i'd be sure to get to the restaurant early enough to make sure you're not seated next to the kids.", "How does OP suck for not wanting to be a babysitter for a kid she barely knows?", "Perhaps. But then you either take care of your own child or you ask someone else you trust to do it for you. I just don't get the rationale of bringing your child to an evening adult event to make them miserable and then delegating the misery of dealing with an understandably miserable child to someone else.", "I\u2019m on team no babysitter unless it\u2019s someone we know really well out of fear, its not a money thing. But I also wouldn\u2019t be brining my kid to a fancy restaurant if one of the few people I trust weren\u2019t available to babysit because that\u2019s kinda rude and honestly will probably ruin the experience for everyone else. Kids can\u2019t sit still. NTA"]}
