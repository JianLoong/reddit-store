Your mother can sit next to the three year old if she wants your cousin and his wife to eat in peace.", "NTA!\nIf your cousin and his wife want to \u201ceat in peace for once\u201d, they can hire a babysitter and enjoy the fancy dinner. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s YOUR dad\u2019s birthday! Why will you be expected to sit there babysitting someone\u2019s child while some they enjoy dinner?", "NTA\n\nWhat a perfect opportunity for your mum to sit with him and do a puzzle together though!", "NTA.  If your mother wanted your cousin and his wife to get a night off, she should have hired an actual sitter or done it herself, not voluntold you to do it.", "NTA. Wow. Two parents and a fancy dinner. Why can't your cousin and his wife get a babysitter for the night? Why are you being singled out to watch the child? Because you are the youngest there besides the children? Because you are a woman? \"IT JUST IS\" that's sexist.\n\nYou are an adult and deserve to enjoy the dinner for your fathers birthday just as much as anyone else there. Tell your mom this and ask her why doesn't she help with the toddler.\n\nYour mom is being unfair and she is wrong. Keep saying no, but be sure to find a seat at the table between two adults because I'm sure your mom will try to make this happen as people are taking seats.", "NTA not your kid not your problem he's your cousins problem", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t your mom sit next to the 3 year old & watch the kids so the parents can eat a meal in peace? You aren\u2019t a built in babysitter.", "NTA- She is giving you a sit s the kids table crap. You've enjoyed your life and should be able to sit with the rest of the adults to indulge and share. It sucks she wishes to spend more free time without the kids but then others should have offered shifts to take instead of forcing you bc they also dont want the responsibility", "NTA - \"Fine, mom, show us how selfless you are by doing it!\"", "NTA. That not your Birthday. Thats a night out for your Cousin. If it's not too late think about just getting with some good friends to celebrate.", "NTA your cousins should get a sitter, their kids are not your responsibility. Sit close to your dad and family and have a great conversation connecting with them and talking about your travels. \nI\u2019m all for family being close and helping each other, but there is a time and place and YOUR dad\u2019s birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant is not the time. Stick to your guns and enjoy yourself.", "I'm so confused. NTA obviously, but why don't they just get a babysitter? Why do they need to make multiple people miserable to save the tiniest amount of money?", "NTA. Maybe your mom should treat them to a babysitter so an entire table can enjoy a fancy meal without the children (who won't appreciate the experience anyway).", "NTA. Parents have no right or business telling college aged children that they\u2019re signed up for babysitting duties, especially at a nice restaurant. \n\nIt\u2019s funny (not \u2018funny\u2019 haha) how she thinks they deserve to have a nice dinner in \u2018peace\u2019 while advising that you will be putting together a puzzle for the little one that will be provided by them to keep you both entertained. \n\nIt\u2019s no wonder you left and went abroad to university. If she insists on making you the voluntarily babysitter you may have no choice but to pass on dinner because you have to doubt you will be comfortable or have a chance to enjoy yourself given the task at hand.", "Someone else's child is not your responsibility.\n\nNo is a complete sentence.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, your mom is really inconsiderate and probably has ulterior motives", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No one has stopped to consider that your father, who you are there to celebrate, might want to be near his own daughter. Doesn't your father want to catch up with you? In that case, go right past your Mom amd Cousins and tell him about this nonsense and he can use birthday boy powers to end it.\n\nBut wow. Four people talking about seating arrangements at a man's birthday dinner and not one of them thought about the man's preference.", "NTA. You have a right to enjoy the fancy meal and the celebration of your own father like everyone else. \nThese children are not your responsibility.  And saying, \u201cIt just is\u201d is not a reason. It\u2019s just repeating that she\u2019s making it your job.\n\nIf this winds up forced upon you, I would ignore the kids and show incompetence. The parents will need to take over.

Because if it was her cousins idea it seems he would have asked OP.
