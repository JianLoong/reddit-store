While we were at a bar I noticed one of my girlfriends friends at the bar with a guy who looked like he wasn't taking on for an answer.

I went up to her and said hi and asked how she was. She seemed happy someone had came over and started talking to me. I asked if she wanted to join me and my friend and told her I'd order her a drink if she wanted to go and sit down. She agreed and went and sat at our table. \n\nWhen I brought the drinks over she thanked me for stepping in and said the other uy had been bothering her for a while. She stayed for an hour or 2 with us and had a few more drinks and then she wanted ot head off home so I ordered her a taxi and made sure she got in the taxi okay. \n\nThe next morning my girlfirend seemed annoyed so I asked what was wrong. She mentioned that another friend of hers had mesaged her to tell her I was sat drinking with her friend and it looked like we were getting on well. I tried to explain what had happened but she just said I was wrong for drinking with her friend.\n\nI mentioned that I was doing her friend a favour and that I was doing nothing wrong.

It did not sound like Charlie Creepo was going to leave her alone so you stepped in and helped remove her from that bad situation. I would imagine she thanked you over and over for helping her get away from him. And you went above and beyond making sure she got in the taxi safe. Chances are Charlie Creepo would have followed her and who knows what would have happened then. The only problem I see is with your girlfriend! Apparently she doesn't care about your friend and any harm that could have come to her. To me that is a huge red flag and I would seriously reconsider my relationship with her. Your girlfriend is showing you her true colors, so only you can decide if that is the kind of person you want to be with. I would think you want to be with a person who has compassion and empathy for others, which she is not showing by her words and actions. You did the right thing by helping your friend and with that said You are my hero! We need more heroes like you so women are not constantly harassed and potentially abused by these Charlie Creepos. And I want to thank you for helping her that night sunshine xoxo", "Nta in this scenario \n\nMajor red flag on the gf tho...a 'normal' line of thinking would be...hey what a great guy you are....right?\n\nAlso presumably your best friend was still there so it wasn't like you 2 were alone...in a bar holding hands?", "nta. you were just being a good friend and making sure she felt safe and comfortable. your girlfriend should trust you more and not jump to conclusions.", "NTA Girlfriend doesn't care what happened and why.

Well done \ud83d\ude09", "Let me get this right\u2026 So you were out with a friend and saw someone you loosely knew who was in a tricky situation. You helped her out. She joined you both for drinks.

Your girlfriend\u2019s friend is an AH for creating unnecessary drama and your girlfriend is an AH for placing demands on you.", "NTA.

For what they can give and bring to actual important people (their family members) as opposed to just having value for being. \n\nRegardless of what you meant when you said this, just know that there are lots of people who say it, usually men, who mean it in its negative context, and there are people who have only heard it used that way.

Your gf is worth a rethink, however.", "NTA, and that \"another friend of hers\" could have helped instead of snitching and gossiping (makes me wonder how accurately they reported the facts to your gf)", "NTA my guy\u2026 you stepped up and helped your girlfriends friend from a creep! \nIf anything your girlfriend should be extremely thankful that she has a boyfriend who goes out of his way to protect another female. \n\nAll I can say is that if I had a friend in this situation and my husband was there, I\u2019d hope he\u2019d do the right thing and help out.", "NTA.\n\nMy wife would be pissed at me if I hadn't done this for a friend of hers.", "Info: why didn\u2019t this girl go back to her friends?

Was she out alone before she joined you?\n\nNTA though", "Message your girlfriend to continue the conversation. You'll get written proof that she didn't like you doing that. Send it to the friend and explain that you won't do it again and that you apologise, and say another friend told your girlfriend, I'm guessing she was out as well and instead of coming to say hi, she instead wanted to cause drama?\n\nYou'll have an ally in this daft little back and forth, because I guess this 'friend' who told her about it wants to see you guys fail, and enabled whatever dark thoughts to happen with your girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend is complaining mainly because she was told by someone else that you were with another girl.

What if that friend had ended up in a nasty situation and you had not done anything for fear of reprisals from your girlfriend? You wouldn't have forgiven yourself.

Also she sounds a bit insecure and immature", "NTA your girlfriend is a dinosaur", "100% not an a-hole. You did a good & decent thing.", "This is a bit extreme as I\u2019ve never met your GF, but run.

I don't really care to have women that are friends anyway, but that control over your choice to talk to other women is extremely taxing. My suggestion talk to your girlfriend and request an apology for how she's treating you, standing your ground can do wonders, and also ask her why she thinks you deserve the treatment and align it on why she feels the way she does.", "NTA - def did the right thing and your girlfriend\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t healthy at all", "I totally agree about it being a huge red flag!

Either your girlfriend is very insecure about your relationship, or her Dad is Mike Pence.", "My x he saved me from being hit on, by an obnoxious drunk dude and I totally agree. Sounds like OP need to be aware and pay attention here. OP did save that friend from an uncomfortable situation or worse.", "They were not alone ffs. NTA op", "I would be like \"lemme get this straight... Your friend saw someone in an uncomfortable situation and rather than intervene, she sat back and spied on the situation to find shit to gossip about? Riiiiight.....\"", "Why bring that up? It makes no sense to mention that she's someone's daughter, that's true of literally every woman.", "Yes, she\u2019s someone\u2019s daughter, everyone is, but that\u2019s not the reason he helped. He did it for her, not her mother.", "Go back to your cringe red pill incel forums, creep.", "Upvote for using the word cuckoobananas", "I would intervene for a *stranger,* and I have. That's how I met my friend Danny!", "But even if that whole incident hadn\u2019t happened, and OP had just ran into the friend of a friend and decided to sit down and have a chat, what\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nNews flash, you can be friends with whoever you want, regardless of how they identify.
