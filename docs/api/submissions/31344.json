While we were at a bar I noticed one of my girlfriends friends at the bar with a guy who looked like he wasn't taking on for an answer. I'd met this friend a couple of times and she walways says hi when she sees me etc so she knows who I am. \n\nI needed another drink so I went to the bar and I heard tht guy keep trying to talk her into letting him et her a drink despite her repeatedly saying no. I went up to her and said hi and asked how she was. She seemed happy someone had came over and started talking to me. I asked if she wanted to join me and my friend and told her I'd order her a drink if she wanted to go and sit down. She agreed and went and sat at our table. \n\nWhen I brought the drinks over she thanked me for stepping in and said the other uy had been bothering her for a while. She stayed for an hour or 2 with us and had a few more drinks and then she wanted ot head off home so I ordered her a taxi and made sure she got in the taxi okay. \n\nThe next morning my girlfirend seemed annoyed so I asked what was wrong. She mentioned that another friend of hers had mesaged her to tell her I was sat drinking with her friend and it looked like we were getting on well. I tried to explain what had happened but she just said I was wrong for drinking with her friend.\n\nI mentioned that I was doing her friend a favour and that I was doing nothing wrong. She just said I shouldn't be having drinks with other women and that it's disrespectful and that I was wron for doing it. \n\nAITA for talking and having a drink with her friend?", "created_utc": 1700480787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zmqs7/aita_for_talking_to_someone_at_a_bar/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your GF seems immature and insecure.  I think you stepped up.", "Hi there, you are my Hero! Your girlfriend is TA 100%! You saved your friend from a potentially very bad experience. It did not sound like Charlie Creepo was going to leave her alone so you stepped in and helped remove her from that bad situation. I would imagine she thanked you over and over for helping her get away from him. And you went above and beyond making sure she got in the taxi safe. Chances are Charlie Creepo would have followed her and who knows what would have happened then. The only problem I see is with your girlfriend! Apparently she doesn't care about your friend and any harm that could have come to her. To me that is a huge red flag and I would seriously reconsider my relationship with her. Your girlfriend is showing you her true colors, so only you can decide if that is the kind of person you want to be with. I would think you want to be with a person who has compassion and empathy for others, which she is not showing by her words and actions. You did the right thing by helping your friend and with that said You are my hero! We need more heroes like you so women are not constantly harassed and potentially abused by these Charlie Creepos. And I want to thank you for helping her that night sunshine xoxo", "Nta in this scenario \n\nMajor red flag on the gf tho...a 'normal' line of thinking would be...hey what a great guy you are....right?\n\nAlso presumably your best friend was still there so it wasn't like you 2 were alone...in a bar holding hands?", "nta. you were just being a good friend and making sure she felt safe and comfortable. your girlfriend should trust you more and not jump to conclusions.", "NTA Girlfriend doesn't care what happened and why.

For what they can give and bring to actual important people (their family members) as opposed to just having value for being. \n\nRegardless of what you meant when you said this, just know that there are lots of people who say it, usually men, who mean it in its negative context, and there are people who have only heard it used that way.
