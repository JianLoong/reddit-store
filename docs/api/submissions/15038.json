Used the internet & finally found someone I thought was a great fit (F). We talked about her moving in. F mentioned that her work wanted her in their office nearby me ASAP. We worked with the apartment complex and F was able to move in 2 days later.\n\nHowever, F didn't tell me F had a service dog until after F had signed the lease and told me about 6 hours before she moved in.  I've never had dogs, and our apartment charges an additional monthly fee to have an animal in the room, but F told me that he was always with her and that she would pay the change in price. I told her I was okay with that and they moved in that night. The weekend rolls around, and F tells me F's going to drive back to her parent's house (about 2 hours away), finish packing up the last of her things and be back.  I said okay, assuming the dog would go with her.\n\nF left the apartment around 5 am. While working on homework, I heard whining coming from F's room at 11.  I opened the door and there was her dog.  I took him outside and he went to the bathroom. I texted her letting her know and asking why F didn't take him with her.  F said that she was almost back and thanked me for taking him out. F came back around 12:30, and I asked again why he hadn't gone with her.  Her response? There wasn't enough room in her friend's car, but that her mom would be picking her up later with a big truck.  I said it made sense then went to take a nap.\n\nWhen I woke up at 1:30 pm, F was gone and her doors were closed, so I went back to studying.  Until at 6 pm when I heard scratching come from her room.  F had left her service dog again. I took him out, again, and texted F saying he had been whining.  F's response: he must've been whining since he missed her and I didn't need to take him out since she had let him out 5 hours ago when she'd been at the apartment.\n\nNot my circus not my monkeys. F came home at 10:30 pm. The next day, F decided she was going to go out.  F took dog out around 11 and then brought him back to the room and then left.  I was studying in my room and around 12:30 her dog Opened My Door and barked at me. I walked out of my room and there in my living room was a fresh pile of dog poo.\n\nI was upset. I texted her and told her what happened. F said she was sorry and that she'd clean up the mess.  She came back 10 minutes later and we talked about it.  I told her I was upset and F responded by offering to have her mom take the service dog back to her parent's house.  I was confused and asked didn't she need her service dog? F told me she'd get through okay and that it was more important to her that I wasn't upset in my own house and F didn't want me upset with her.\n\nAITA for making a big deal?", "created_utc": 1681748494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pnr9v/aita_for_making_a_big_deal_about_roommates/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to be responsible for her own pet.", "NTA! If this was a true service dog, she would have it with her at all times. This is NOT a service dog!!!", "NTA. This isn't a service dog. Honestly, you need to reconsider having F as your roommate. She's been dishonest about the dog and purposely hid his existence until the last minute to manipulate you into accepting her in the apartment. She's a terrible dog owner and that animal is suffering being locked up in a bedroom for hours on end. \n\nYes her parents should definitely take the dog since she's neglecting him. But you should also terminate her lease and find someone else. She's a walking red flag.", "NTA, and this is probably not a service dog.", "NTA.\n\nPretty sure that by \"service dog\" she means \"dog that I call a service dog and may have purchased a vest for on Amazon\". If she can basically function normally without it and leave it with her mom, it's not a service dog. It's a dog. And she still needs to take care of it.", "NTA\n\nThat is obviously not a service dog. It doesn't even sound like an emotional support animal. And keeping it locked in a room is cruel.", "NTA, but surely this can't be a service dog. At a minimum, if the dog stays I would insist that as her service dog, you expect the dog never to be at the apartment without her. \n\nBut tbh, since she has lied to you, I would be exploring options for breaking the lease/getting rid of her and her non-service dog.", "NTA. She didn't even tell you she had the dog until it was too late for you to say anything about it.\n\nAlso, please correct me if I'm wrong, but the fact that she leaves her dog locked up in a room all the time tells me it might not actually be a service dog. Most people have service dogs because they need them. Which would mean she should be bringing the dog with her most places. It almost seems like a cop out reason for her not telling you she had a pet in the beginning. Because legally you can't tell her to not have a service dog. Even in buildings that typically don't allow pets. \n\nEither way, this pet deserves a better life. I'd be making a pretty big deal out of it too.", "NTA- this is not a service dog. She lied to you about it being one so you had to accept her moving in with the dog. If it can go back to her parents place that's where it needs to go", "NTA, and who the hell leaves their service dog behind at any point in time? I would advise the leasing office. This sounds like she's trying to avoid paying the pet fee.", "Ehhhh sounds like it's an emotional support animal that she promised some random certificate for online. That's an insult to those with real service dogs. Please don't sign your next lease with her when it's time", "NTA. I really, really doubt that is a service dog. I think you've been fooled.\n\nDogs really are great though!", "NTA, and that is 100% NOT a service dog like by definition. Not only that, but the dog is not even well taken cared of.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of service is this dog providing if its home alone all the time?\n\nThe dog is either a support animal or pet.", "NTA - She should have told you about the dog before you agreed for her to move in. She hid the dog for a reason, probably because she's been rejected by other RM in the past. But the issue is that you could have had an allergy to dogs that would have put your health at risk and she didn't care.\n\nShe claims it's a service dog but never takes it anywhere with her. It seems she leaves it home all day and I have a feeling she knows You're there so you will do what's necessary for taking the dog out and taking care of it when she's out.\n\nHer responses to you seem very passive, as though she doesn't care much about how this is affecting you.\n\nThis is not a service dog if she's leaving it home all the time. She's probably pretending or applied for it to be a service dog just so she can't be refused a lease.\n\nNot being told about the dog and then having to clean up and take care of it is worth making a big deal out of. She's taking advantage.", "No and Id rescind the lease you offered her.  She intentionally omitted facts and let you find out after the lease was signed there was a dog.  You are not obligated to accept her service dog when seeking a roommate\n\nHer claim of service dog is bullshit.  The dog really doesnt go everywhere with her.  It was a farce.  This is a serious breach of trust.  I would mot want to live wt her.  NTA", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a service dog.", "Not a service dog. I have one and she goes everywhere with me. Also if it was a service dog there would be NO pet fee at an apartment as showing proof doc says need service dog and training and upkeep of shots means any apt or housing must waive the fee as it's not a pet. So isn't a service dog.", "NTA\n\nShe 100% should've mentioned the dog when applying (don't most places have you declare this beforehand when you sign the contract/lease?)\n\nIt's also almost certainly just a pet and not a service dog, seeing as she doesn't take it everywhere with her...", "NTA your new roommate already sounds horrible. Service dog or not she left him for hrs and only had a sorry for you then did it AGAIN. If you allow it now the dog will become your responsibility. Nip it in the bud now!", "NTA but your roommate is", "NTA and that is NOT a service dog. Service dogs are trained for YEARS for other abled people to PERFORM A SERVICE or multiple SERVICES for their humans. This rquires that the service dog ACCOMPANY THEIR HUMAN wherever they go, at ALL TIMES, with VERY FEW exceptions. She may call it a service dog, but you can ask to see it's papers, and ask what SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS the dog performs for her. If she is unable to produce either, you have every right to kick her out as SHE LIED about this dog being a CERTIFIED SERVICE ANIMAL.", "OP -NTA\n\nDepending on what state you live in, \\*Edit\\*- ESA animals in terms of living in a rented space have the same rules as service animals in regards to waived pet rent and pet fees, if you provide a letter from an actual therapist, not one of those online ones. If your state does accept ESA then the pet fee would be waived. However it sounds like the dog isn't really and ESA since she's not taking him with her all the time.\n\nI would sit down with her again and ask if she's comfortable talking about the dog, and what service he provides her etc.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My bad. haha", "An 8 month old dog could be training to be a service animal but she isn't even doing that if she's leaving it alone for hours and hours.", "Yes I am aware of this, however some people like to try and call their ESA's service animals to try and cheat the system. \n\nIt sounds like F's dog may not be an actual service dog, as it would need to be with her all the time. \n\nIt sounds more like she has and ESA and is calling it a service dog. However with the Fair Housing Act, they have made accommodations for ESA animals to be able to live in rental properties with proof that they are for emotional support, a legal letter from a psychologist to corroborate that said animal is ESA.
