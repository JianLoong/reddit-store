Requirements to be considered as service dog and whether they need to be specifically registered does vary depending on your country and where you live. (I'm not american)\n\nPsychiatric service dogs exist and can also be owner trained rather than from a specific organization. Typically, psychiatric service dogs are also task trained for other things like reminding the handler to take medication or blocking for crowd control before anxiety attack hits. Many veterans have psychiatric service dogs for PTSD.

While couch-surfing with whoever would take her, she\u2019d lock it in her room for days on end, leaving whatever poor sap she was living with that week to deal with its barking, peeing and pooping. She only fed the dog McDonald\u2019s and carrots. The poor thing ended up emaciated, sick, and full of worms (she also didn\u2019t get it vaccinated). By the way, my sister also told anyone who could listen that her bulldog was a \u201cservice dog\u201d who could sense when she was about to have a seizure. By her own admission, she *only* ever had seizures in public, crowded areas with plenty of spectators - so weird! /s\n\nMy parents ended up buying the dog for $200, and rehoused it with a family friend. He\u2019s doing great now, thankfully. But yeah\u2026 your roommate is lying.

Nor would a service dog, that\u2019s been trained properly, just poop in the house unless it was stress or medical. Since she had just moved in and was running off without her I could contribute it to stress but unlikely.", "NTA if it's a service dog, why is the dog not being used. This is a normal dog. At best this is an emotional support dog, but even then she ain't taking the dog anywhere!   \n\n\nSO IRRESPONSIBLE of her to leave the dog for long hours alone closed in a room - only to require the roommate to answer to the dog. WTF.  \n\n\nI'd be pissed with said roommate too - and I'm a dog lover.", "This is a pet, 100%.... no ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nAnd she tried to pull a fast one on you.\n\nNTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.", "Maybe I\u2019m missing something, but how much of a \u201cservice dog\u201d is this if the owner doesn\u2019t take them along?", "Also, check with the apartment complex.  Failure to disclose a pet in many buildings is cause for eviction.", "NTA - and WTF kinda service dog gets left behind 2 days in a row for hours and hours and hours?\n\nTime to make 1 easy to follow rule. The 'service' dog goes with her everywhere or you're taking it to the pound.", "THAT IS NOT SERVICE DOG!  Your roommate is bad dog owner.  I suggest you to talk to your landlord about her.  You should break a lease.  Call all animal shelter about her.  She should not adopt any pet ever!  NTA", "I will agree that the dog does not sound like a service dog, but not all service dogs are constantly with their owners. An example: my grandpa had extreme sleep apnea, and refused to use any breathing device at night. He had a service dog that would alert if he stopped breathing and start barking until he woke up and would breathe himself, or woke someone who could do so themselve. She was also trained to press a quick call button for 911 and keep barking if no one was around to wake up my grandpa and he wouldn't stir. She saved his life multiple times, he was stubborn as hell. The dog was not needed out of the house at all, but had a use in house specifically at night. There are multiple ways a dog can be a service dog, without needing to constantly be at their owners side, though the ones that are constantly at their handlers side are much more obvious.", ">  If this was a true service dog, she would have it with her at all times. \n\nThis is not necessarily true. It is HIGHLY dependent on the needs of the disabled person.\n\nMy sister is deaf, she has a legitimate service dog. It is specially trained to assist her in her disability, but she does not need the dog 24/7. She really only needs the dogs to be her ears when she is home alone. The dog is trained to alert and even wake her for her phone ringing, the smoke alarm, the town's tornado siren, the door bell etc. \n\nShe has had issues with renting because people have accused her service dog of not being legitimate because her disability isn't readily visible and she doesnt take the dog with her 24/7. \n\nIt is important not to spread disinformation about legitimate service dogs because it does negatively impact people who need them.", "Someone who has a service dog for dangerous sleep disorders(sleep apnea\\copd issues for example) do not need to take their dogs to the store or to school, but may need them at night. With that said, the dog does not sound like a service dog at all. Maybe an esa, but definitely not a service dog.", "If OP hadn't let the poor dog out the second time, he would have been locked up in an unfamiliar room by himself for NINE STRAIGHT HOURS!!!! F is neglecting her poor dog, and OP should absolutely insist that he go back to live with F's parents. IMMEDIATELY.", "Agree but . . . To have a service dog placed with you, you generally go through some training with the organization that includes proper animal care.  My wife has worked with an org that provides service dogs to veterans with physical and or mental disabilities and they teach the recipients how to care for their dogs. Generally they make the recipients sign an agreement to abide by their rules for care. Leaving a dog the way OPs roommate did would be a violation of this agreement.  Now I know some people just are AHs but honestly I\u2019ve never met someone with a service dog who didn\u2019t follow or exceed the standards of care. \n\nMaybe OP should ask what organization placed the do with the roommate. If the roommate says they trained them, they most likely are lying about the dog.", "That's really weird for someone who has a service animal", ">To have a service dog placed with you, you generally go through some training with the organization that includes proper animal care\n\nThe US at least allows service dogs to be owner-trained, with no requirements for specific training, abilities, or certification beyond the \"is supposed to behave and basically ignore surroundings in public\" (there's a more formal definition that I can't recall at the moment). Requiring specific certification or licenses was deemed to be an unfair barrier to access against disabled people.", "Fun fact: at least in the US, the ADA specifies pretty specifically that the disabled person does not need to go through a company or group to get a service dog, that any dog breed can be a service dog, that the disabled person has the right to select their own dog and train their own dog themselves. I do not think the described dog the op had to deal with is a service dog, but its important not to alienate actual disabled people who actually pick and train their own service dogs.\n\nIt is actually not that difficult to do(though is very time intensive), and there are guides online to teach you how to properly screen, select  and train service dogs. I have a self-trained and selected psychiatric service dog, as it was the most affordable way to get mine. It took me over a year of constantly going to the pound and screening dogs to find one that was promising, and training took about 3 years for 4 services(orbiting, dpt, anxiety attack alerting,  schedule keeping oriented tasks). I have friends in my support group with organization trained dogs, and you honestly couldn't pick out which of our dogs at group therapy are home trained or organization trained unless you knew specifically they were. My boy sits under my chair and does all the same trained processes as someone who paid a couple thousand for a trained dog. \n\nOf note, I am autistic with extreme pressure and texture sensitivities, so my dog needs a specific hair texture, length, and weight, of which goldens, and German shepherds and other common service dogs that the organizations select and train are not appropriate for me. I did initially consider an organization, but as hey are generally specific in breed type and size, I had to go a different way.  My guy is a markiesje with hair softer than a poodle or silky terrier, and weighs right in my goldilocks zone of 23-29 lbs of where dpt works for me without being too light or triggering my pressure sensitivities.", "Agree. However people who have service dogs are trained by the organizations that place the dogs in proper care. OPs roommate is either lying about the dog or an AH who is neglecting the dog.", "Yeah, service dogs aren't considered fully trained until maybe 2-3 years old. Many pups scrub out before then.", "The FHA (Federal Housing Administration) oversees housing discrimination as determined by the FHA (Fair Housing Act)."]}
