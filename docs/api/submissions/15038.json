Requirements to be considered as service dog and whether they need to be specifically registered does vary depending on your country and where you live. (I'm not american)\n\nPsychiatric service dogs exist and can also be owner trained rather than from a specific organization. Typically, psychiatric service dogs are also task trained for other things like reminding the handler to take medication or blocking for crowd control before anxiety attack hits.

While couch-surfing with whoever would take her, she\u2019d lock it in her room for days on end, leaving whatever poor sap she was living with that week to deal with its barking, peeing and pooping. She only fed the dog McDonald\u2019s and carrots. The poor thing ended up emaciated, sick, and full of worms (she also didn\u2019t get it vaccinated). By the way, my sister also told anyone who could listen that her bulldog was a \u201cservice dog\u201d who could sense when she was about to have a seizure. By her own admission, she *only* ever had seizures in public, crowded areas with plenty of spectators - so weird! /s\n\nMy parents ended up buying the dog for $200, and rehoused it with a family friend. He\u2019s doing great now, thankfully. But yeah\u2026 your roommate is lying.

There's quite a few Youtube guides on training specific tasks that you may need done for instance, and that's mostly what I used. I also did take my dog in the beginning to basic obedience training and he does have his canine good citizen. \n\nThere's numerous other guidelines they have online to help you select a dog from any stage of life that may help you, but they do recommend that the dog is not Reactive to people or other dogs and that they are young in age. I've found that dogs about 6-7 months old are prime for evaluating, and though you can do it with puppies, some behaviors that pop up later may cause them to need to be washed out of training. 6-7 months old is in the realm of when they're starting to grow into their bodies and their behaviors are really moldable... but one of the people in my therapy group has a dog who was 2 when they got her. Because of how long it takes to train a dog and the \"Reasonable use\" time of their lifetime, it's not really recommended for them to be much older to start training than 2...BUT I've heard from my therapist and psychologist of just ordinary, older household pets being taught a single task to aid their owners and being successful with it.\n\nWith that said about all breeds being able to be service dogs, A lot of groups do recommend against bully breeds, huskys, malamutes, Shar-peis, Chows, and similar strong-willed dogs(Even border collies, though super smart, may be unsuitable depending on if they have an extremely high energy drive). Though there ARE successful dogs within those breeds working as service dogs, their ingrained instinctual, in-bred behaviors tend to preclude them from training well(and many guides will point this out). I would definitely recommend spaniels, greyhounds and poodles though as a-typical breeds to look at for service dogs.", "Yeah, if it doens't cost a fortune to get a dog, the wait list is ridiculous. I did try to talk to a group with a wait list, but they were pretty limited in the types of dog breeds they worked with, and most dog hair types just... really upset me. It's like chalkboard screeching in your brain from feeling it. My dog Mikey's hair is legit newborn baby soft, it took me a LONG time to find him, but he is a pound rescue in the end.\n\nSome training definitely does need more specific trainers. Funny enough, things like Scent training for diabetics is fairly simple to train in IF you know how to select the right dog, but sight oriented/mobility dogs can be a lot different. \n\nTraining my dog in DPT was fairly easy, as it was no different than \"Lay down\" but on my chest or across my waist. Similarly orbiting was pretty simple and my husband helped me with that in the home before moving to stores, so he knew that he had to keep a range around me and where to position himself. \n \nLearning to do DPT autonomously or get my attention when having a panic attack was a little more difficult, and that was what took the longest, but he came through eventually picking up on it because I would feel it come on and ask him to do DPT. He would anticipate it a little beforehand as he started noticing the signs, probably in my breathrate and heart rate or something and getting anxious. From there, I  started training him to paw at my foot or bark if I wasn't listening.\n\nRetrieving my Clonazepam bottle(in the house, he's got one tucked in his vest for outside), and responding to a timed ultrasonic beep to force me to leave the house on schedules and wake me up also were fairly easy to do.\n\nTo be honest, the hardest part of it... was probably the desensitizing to outside stimulus, and if it weren't for family of mine who helped me with it, he probably wouldn't ahve been able to get through it and pass the Canine good citizen's test, but he's really opened up the world for me now.\n\nBUT, it's a lot of work, and to be honest, a lot of people just do not have the time to train their own service dogs OR the capabilities to do so.

I have nothing more than time on my hands.", "There is no requirement true, but it\u2019s very hard to do. It can cost a lot because many promising dogs fail out along the way - in the puppy breeding program at the org I volunteered with over 50% failed out, some after quite a bit of training. If you spend the money on a healthy dog you could put in a lot of time and money and end up with a dog that can\u2019t do the job for a variety of reasons.

The issue the ADA and government have is that Cats, Birds, Small animals, etc cannot be RELIABLY trained to do so, and they do not make exceptions for the ones who have learned/have been honed from what they have learned.\n\nThere are many accounts of dogs learning on their own the scent of their owner's breath during diabetic distress, dogs learning themselves of their owner's signs of seizures, of autistic breakdowns, ptsd episodes, Anxiety. That alone doesn't make the dog a service dog, UNLESS they do it reliably and the disabled person's Doctor specifically acknowledges it(and this is a rare thing, but it does happen if it was well documented. This is actually relatively \"common\" as an occurence in many apnea related service dogs). Training just hones it, and teaches the dog expected behaviors when they \"Sense\" the impending health/mental health crisis. Please remember, a service dog only needs to know one task, and as long as it is both reliably reproduced and provides a service and is NOT normally something an animal does on it's own, then it counts. A dog that has learned on it's own that it's owner stops breathing in their sleep and starts barking and  trying to wake them or others is both something that has been shown to spontaneously occur in some dogs, and counts as a service if it is repeated consistantly. This behavior is not considered \"normal\" as any normal dog would not figure out that something is wrong on their own, but it is considered spontaneous, and training is generally HIGHLY recommended to hone the response.\n\nMy grandfather's dog was one of these dogs, She started alerting on her own, and after multiple times of her waking him or someone else up during his episodes where he stopped breathing at night, his doctor recommended further training, in which she was trained specifically in response time: 30 seconds trying to wake my grandfather up, 15 seconds searching the home for someone else, and waking them up. immediately after if A: he didn't wake up and B: no one else is there, she slammed the button that autocalled 911.", "The roommate is maybe lying about the dog, but is most certainly neglecting its care!", "Ah, yes, that makes sense.

She\u2019s a crappy (pun intended) pet owner too", "That don\u2019t sound like no service dog.\n\nShock horror, another dog owner acting selfish and entitled. The audacity of trying to sneak her pet into the apartment. NTA.", "That's not an actual service dog, it is just an emotional support animal which is nothing more than just a household pet.  You are NTA", "NTA\n\n\nF seems to really lack communication skills. First from failing to inform you about the dog. And next from not telling you when she'd be leaving the dog home for hours.\n\n\nIf you want to give F and the dog a second chance, now's the time to sit down a set some boundaries about the dog being in the apartment.\nAn important one would be giving you notice when the dog would be left alone. That she should make sure to take the dog out before leaving. \n\n\nBut the lies of omission are very concerning.", "> Dogs really are great though!\n\nYep! That shit in the middle of the living room carpet is the best!", "NTA OP.  It sounds like she was trying to pass a pet off as a service animal, which is not cool.  I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re at, but where I live, if you have the proper documentation from your doctor stating that you need a service or an emotional support animal, then you don\u2019t have to pay those fees.", "This is not a fucking service dog. \n\nNTA", "even if it really is a service dog the owner is responsible for its care. For example, in a hospital situation, if you bring a service dog in you must be able to care for it yourself. You cannot rely on hospital staff to do it.", "Not necessarily. My 15 lb. service dog has been with me for almost 4 years now and while he\u2019s with me majority of the time, there are moments when I\u2019m away but for no more than 3 hrs. On average 15min-1 hr. It truly depends on your needs and how you manage your disability. Mine is mostly due to symptoms from a brain injury I got from a car accident. If you met me, you wouldn\u2019t know that I have a disability. When it comes to leaving my dog at home for a bit, I do make sure that my service dog is taken cared of before I leave. He is also trained to use potty pads, just in case. I consider this his \u201cbreak\u201d from work. He\u2019s usually taking a nap when home alone.\n\nHowever, in this case, the pet owner is truly negligent and hasn\u2019t followed protocols nor training for their dog. It probably was anxious in a new home. Sad that it was not trained to use potty pads nor given adequate exercise.", "But this is also not true and a myth that gets spread that causes real service dog and handler teams a lot of grief. \n\nService dogs do not need to be professionally trained according to the ADA. Federal law allows for owners to train their own service dog. MANY service dogs are owner-trained as a cost saving measure. This does not mean they are not legitimate service animals. \n\nThis is not a judgement on OP's roommate but all this misinformation that is being spouted in the comments, like service dogs need to be with their owner 24/7 or that only real service dogs come from organizations. \n\nI think OP's roommate is an AH, but the bad information being spread in these comments about service dogs is damaging to real teams.", "Nta. That is not a service dog", "this doesn't sound like a service dog... now this might be a complex to complex difference but the one person i know of with a service animal does not pay their complexes pet rent because their dog is considered a medical device. the complex doesn't charge extra for those.\n\nthis may be an emotional support dog (questionable) but that doesn't make it a service dog... and she's an iffy pet owner. 5 hours without peeing can be rough for some dogs. i'm not saying it never happens but it's clear she doesn't care\n\nNTA", "People who claim pet dogs are \"service dogs\" are the real AHs", "No one who needs a service dog would go anywhere without them."]}
