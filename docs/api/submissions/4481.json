You responded with a joke that was not in any way inappropriate.  Don't apologize.", "NTA - OP's coworker's husband was unwise to bring up such a sensitive matter, actually.  \nOP responded in a humorous, socially appropriate way. Not ***his*** fault his coworker's husband has a low sperm count and little discretion. That's the only reason, imo, that subject would have even been brought up, especially since he then behaved as though he'd swallowed a frog when OP mentioned his apparent immunity to soy sauce.  \nIf the coworker \"doesn't appreciate that sort of talk\" she really should tell her ***husband*** to not start conversations other people might finish in a way neither of them 'appreciate'.", "NTA", "NTA. He brought up sperm, not you, and he was on about some \"soyboy\" sounding bullshit at that. If soy makes men infertile, I guess Asia didn't get the memo. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA. Brad probably thinks I'm a trans woman because I eat too much soy. Fucking weirdos. Your response was perfect!", ">What? How does the count of your children is giving away ANYTHING about your sex life? Ok, you had sex four times, that's clear.\n\nYou reminded me of when my husband made my dad SHUT UP when I was pregnant. \n\nMy dad thinks he's hilarious, and the more people who dislike his joke the funnier he thinks it is.  When I became pregnant with my first child he kept saying \"Now I know you've only had sex once. And since your sister has no kids she's still a virgin.\"\n\nHA HA! SO FUNNY DAD! My sister and I both hate that joke. It was stupid and gross, and we were both in committed long term relationships and living with our partners for multiple years. After my son was born, dad kept making the joke basically every time my sister and I were with him.\n\nThen I had my second son and the joke evolved to I've had sex twice and my child-free sister still a virgin. Still not funny. But that didn't stop dad. We both told him it was a bad joke and to stop making it, but he didn't. My mom told him to stop, but he didn't listen to her either. HIS MOM told him to knock it off especially since my kids were by then 2 and 5, and that seemed to finally work. The joke had run its course.\n\nBut, we were surprised with a third baby. At a family dinner with my husband ,my children, my sister, and her husband my dad got a stupid look on his face and goes \"Guess now you've had sex three times huh? At least (sister) is still a virgin. Ha ha ha\"\n\nWithout missing a beat my husband laughs and responds \"Yup. We've had sex three times. Once more than you, Dad.\"\n\nMy sister; my ONLY sister; her husband, and my mom all busted out laughing. My dad looked like he had been slapped. He never told that joke again.", "Brad is absolutely the AH and so is his ridiculous wife.", "No. Apologising to morons makes them think they\u2019re correct", "Time to stop socializing with these people and stick to interacting about work-related things only.

And then find new friends.", "so, let me understand this. soy sauce is male birth control? why did we not know this before?  \nNTA, enjoy your soy sauce.", "NTA. He brought it up. You played along. Then they get offended. For some reason they took it personally.  Not your problem", "NTA, how absurd that the topic he introduced being laughed off like that was seen as somehow inappropriate! \n\nIf he was squeamish about it why the hell start in on you about it!?!", "NTA\n\nYou were right...dumbest argument ever. Your coworker is fucking crazy. Her husband literally brought it up. Don't apologize and stay away from her she is clearly the type of person to make an innocent, insignificant situation into a massive thing (he was looking at me = he's into me type thing). Be careful.\n\nEven if infertility/virility is a sore spot, her texting you about it making her 'uncomfortable' was weird an inappropriate. Would she tell a mother that talking about her kids makes her 'uncomfortable'?", "NTA. Brad and your coworker sound like stuffy people. Make stupid commentss, get stupid responses. Don't be offended when you open the conversation up to something you're not entirely comfortable talking to someone else about.

He said it's cuz he doesn't like thinking about his daughters as people who have sex. So he gets uncomfortable seeing me pregnant, and then having kids, cuz that's proof I've had sex before. I told him to deal with it because I'm a person not just his daughter.", "Not sure if you\u2019re just saying it\u2019s not funny or are genuinely confused, so ignore this if unnecessary!\n\nBasically saying sex is require for pregnancy. \nOne child means one guaranteed sexual encounter. \nSo that\u2019s the joke. \nIt\u2019s not funny.

Just thought you should know.", "No, you don't owe an apology IMHO", "I guess that makes more sense - a somewhat somber observation? But putting it as a joke over and over makes it seem less 'I don't like thinking about my daughter having sex' and more 'I like making her feel uncomfortable about having sex'. Just my two cents though, sorry not trying to insult your dad!", "Thanks - I guess it was both, I couldn't see any humor nor could see why he was commenting on it..", "Oh yeah. I agree. He likes making people uncomfortable and then when you call him out on his shit he defends himself with something that *kinda* makes sense. It's like the quote from Brooklyn 99. Cool motive, still murder.  I'm glad he can figure out why he's being a dick, but let's work on just NOT being a dick.", "It\u2019s a joke I\u2019ve heard before.

Similar to a dad with a shotgun intimidating a daughter\u2019s date. Just stupid stuff.", "Haha oh my sounds like so many friends' parents I know... Hope he learns to recognize his effect soon..", "Honestly he has. He stopped drinking, and since then it's like night and day. He is a lot more considerate and also has a LOT more impulse control. He also started therapy at the same time and his therapist does not take his shit at all.", "NTA, you don\u2019t owe him an apology. Brad brought it up, not you. Weird topic, Brad.

Brad brought up the topic and her excuse that Brad was being academic while you were not is honestly pathetic. Brad\u2019s wife just didn\u2019t like that you proved him wrong.", "NTA, the academic context excuse makes things worse, not better. Your choice of food and it's impact on your reproductive ability isn't his business, you attempted to deflect with a joke and they overreacted. Just a guess, but it sounds like they may have been trying unsuccessfully to have kids for awhile, and projecting their insecurities on to you.", "This, be careful around this coworker and while I agree you\u2019re NTA, the smart move here is to apologize anyway. This woman is not your friend. The fact she confronted you over this is crazy and rest assured she\u2019ll be spreading rumors about you at work in no time if you don\u2019t nip this in the bud.

Unless you guys were talking about trying to get a higher sperm count, it is incredibly bizarre that he would bring that up, suggesting that he is constantly thinking about his maleness and assumes all other males do the same.\n\nNTA\n\nYou may want to respond back that his comment was very off-putting to you because you have no idea why they would think you are obsessed about your masculinity that he would caution you off soy sauce.", "NAH - Sounds like a cracker of a response to me", "NAH, wtf? Sure, you weren't exactly \"polite\" but seriously? Your co-worker needs to get her mind out of the gutter, saying you have 4 kids despite drinking soy sauce isn't the same as you talking about your sex life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWtf???", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d even bring it up.
