They said yes so I cut up the hot dogs and poured eggs on the pan scrambled them, added a little bit of cheese and put it on a piece of bread, lettuce and tomato and added a little bit of ketchup on the side of their plate, they loved it and said it was delicious.\n\nMy husband and I had went out so they stayed with their grandparents, we got back on Sunday afternoon, my MIL pulled us aside and said that the kids were asking her to make this sandwich that I made them and asked us why I would give kids hot dogs for breakfast with eggs and how unhealthy, i taken back but I also had to remember that she\u2019s an older middle class white woman that lived in the suburbs of an affluent white neighborhood so I explained to her that growing up, eating that was something my mom did, like many hispanic people did.

I told her yeah I know. I was born here, I\u2019ve celebrated thanksgiving all my life, what\u2019s something weird I could possibly make? And then she said it. \u201cWell I was just wondering if you were gonna make a Mexican twist on things.\u201d\n\nI said that is very racist and she gasped saying how could I say that? It\u2019s not racist because I am Mexican and I was the one giving the kids weird things, shouldn\u2019t send them to school with ethnic food so they don\u2019t get bullied. I hung up and I was scared to tell my husband but I told him when he came home from work and he was angry and told his mom that she could stay home and eat dry bland Turkey if she wanted because we were having thanksgiving and if she wanted to come, she needed to apologize and mean it.

The family won't be split up because of you, but because of your MIL's racist actions. Equating Mexican food with 'weird' food is racist, and it isn't sensitive or dramatic to be insulted by what she said. She's just trying to shift blame when she is the one at fault.\nI'm glad your husband has your back.", "I'm an old white lady (54) and we had that same exact dish when I was growing up and I've made it for my children.  \n\nNTA.  Thanks for your post you brought back good memories for me. I feel bad for you though. Maybe you guys should have some space from your MIL. As I read your post I kept thinking man this MIL sounds so ignorant and then I remembered racism is ignorance.", "NTA.  That was so racist!  Good for you for calling her on it.  You did not ruin Thanksgiving, she did.", "NTA. Yay to your husband supporting you!! I get wanting a traditional thanksgiving meal on a holiday but holy hell your MIL is being racist. \n\nShe called Mexican food \u201cweird\u201d, which I find ironic because the breakfast you described involves hot dogs which screams America to me and also sounds delicious. \n\nShe also indicated your step-kids will be bullied for bringing ethnic food to class. I doubt this will be the case but the implication was manipulative and rude.", "NTA. You're the one being sensitive and dramatic? I don't think so. Classic case of MIL projecting on you because she got called out on her racist crap.  \n\n\nHave Thanksgiving at your house, and enjoy it. Sounds to me like it'd definitely be better if she *wasn't* there.", "NTA \n\nYou aren't responsible for your MIL's  racism and racist comments. She is.\n\nAs your husband pointed out, she was out of line. Good for him for shutting her bs down.\n\nThis is on her. Not you. Enjoy the holiday with your family.", "NTA   she is ignorant and it shows", "Do not feel bad that you told your husband that his mom is a racist asshole. Bet she won\u2019t tell people they can\u2019t have lasagna for their thanksgiving. There\u2019s more to the holiday than turkey and cranberry sauce that she apparently doesn\u2019t care about or understand. NTA and your husband did the right thing about disinviting her. But question. Do you mix the hot dog and eggs together in the pan?", "\u2026and now thanksgiving will be awkward because MIL was racist. \n\n*fixed that for you\n\nEDIT, NTA", "NTA you did not ruin thanksgiving, SHE DID", "NTA. Your MIL is certainly keeping up the tradition of stereotypical mothers in law, isn\u2019t she? \nDon\u2019t sweat it. It\u2019ll blow over. \nSounds like your husband is a stand-up guy. Good for you. Keep being civil in spite of her horrible behavior", "NTA.  Your MIL is being racist and rude.  Good for your husband recognizing that his mother is being horrid and standing up to her.  SHE is the one who is splitting the family for the holiday, not you.  If she could avoid being nasty to you, and take responsibility for her actions, you could all have a nice meal together.

If your kids like the food and your husband is cool with them eating it, that\u2019s all that matters. I\u2019m white but live in a town that is very diverse! I\u2019ve enjoyed eating different ethnic foods and can\u2019t imagine making fun of anyone at school when they had it when I was in school. \n\nIt was your husbands choice to tell his mom to not come to thanksgiving!", "NTA - If you telling someone what someone else said splits the family, IT ISNT YOUR FAULT.

MIL was def the AH, but maybe it would help her \u201cfears of spicy turkey\u201d if you send her your planned recipes / meal in advance. Be firm & say you are not changing it, but you\u2019d like to let her know what you are making, and she is welcome to add some appetizers, side dishes, or deserts to bring.

However, your MIL is, as well as being racist, bigoted and an overall pearl clutcher.\n\nThe family would not be splitting up because of you. If anything were to happen like that, it would be your MIL's fault, not yours.\n\nNone of this is on you. Please do not put the onus of this on yourself. You are not to blame.

Not at all. She needs to apologize for her small closed mind. Food is food and all that matters is that it\u2019s delicious. I hope she gets bland dry food next Thursday", "NTA, and no, the family will not be split up because of you, if SHE chooses not to apologize for HER actions, the family will be split because of HER.

Sorry she's racist as heck but at least your hubs is a gem!", "NTA\n\nFirst your MIL is racist and it's good you husband has your back so you've got 90% of it solved. \n\nSecond, hot dogs are not less healthy than bacon or sausage so it's totally her oddness and nothing to do with nutrition that makes her think that's odd", "NTA. I ate this all the time! We grew up poor but my siblings and I are some what bouji foodies now. That being said the Whole Foods Version ( Organic All Beef no Nitrates Hot Dogs ) just doesn\u2019t taste right! We\u2019ve all had to go find a Mexican Market and get the cheap stuff to get the same flavor!! I feed the OG recipe to my kids all the time! We eat it with corn tortillas and ketchup!\n\nI hope you stuff the Turkey with Frijoles Rancheros (beans with Hot Dogs or Sausages) just to spite her!", "NTA", "Same, cheap food is cheap food in any culture! I have made \u201cMexican\u201d turkey on multiple thanksgivings because taco seasoning is YUMMY and cheaper than the traditional fresh herbs and we don\u2019t always have the extra money for that. Also \u201cItalian\u201d turkey, the basil was on day old sale. You make what you have taste good!", "I\u2019m glad to hear that! My mom always made great dishes for us on a budget and I thought so as well it\u2019s a universal thing and yes, unfortunately she is if of any but I\u2019m thankful that my husband backed me up and it was his choice to disinvite her unless she truly apologized", ">He was angry and told his mom that she could stay home and eat dry bland Turkey if she wanted because we were having thanksgiving and if she wanted to come, she needed to apologize and mean it\n\nSo glad your husband has your back and has a very take no crap from MIL attitude!!!", "I'm thinking that if her stepkids brings stuff like that to school everybody wants to be their friend, but that's just my opinion.\n\nNTA OP, and give your hubby a big hug and kisses for standing up for you like that.", "Yeah we\u2019re definitely just having our own thanksgiving at our home and if she doesn\u2019t want to come or try the food, fine by me. I\u2019m not going to be made to feel bad by her", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking. Many cultures and people have different dishes. I still plan to stick to traditional things. I wasn\u2019t going to crazy out the box but yes, first I put a tiny bit of oil and cut up the hot dogs in little circles and let them brown a bit and then I pour the scrambled egg on it and mix it together until it\u2019s cooked and add a little cheese ontop so it melts and that\u2019s pretty much it.", "It definitely will. She\u2019s holding her ground that what she said wasn\u2019t racist but I just don\u2019t want it to cause tension with everyone", "Sure is!

It was always interesting (in a good way) when my Filipina aunt hosted Christmas, because in addition to the usual family pot luck (which was very traditional except for my uncle who always brings chili to everything), we\u2019d have lumpia and I think pancit and sometimes other things.  And everyone loves good lumpia, they\u2019re just irresistible.", "That sounds amazing. I\u2019m glad you guys are having that.

It\u2019s not even just food, all of the cultures have super interesting traditions and languages and just a whole different way of doing things that is really fun to lean about and observe.\nIt\u2019s sad that people just can\u2019t learn about things and be more open minded.", "Only live once...gotta make it fun, not the same old same old.", "It is like migas but I think it\u2019s definitely easier. Migas are more tricky because of the tortilla texture. I think you can do it! It\u2019s really not complicated imo and when lost, I always watch a tiktok video to follow a recipe or youtube", "Oh yeah, The tomato is totally optional. My brother would also opt for without any veggies lol or just having it inside a tortilla but I hope you like it!", "NGL, I love a good food festival.  One of the things I miss from the city I lived in for grad school is Fiesta week - huge city-wide party, with a couple hundred food stalls selling mostly Mexican food from all over the country.  Like 8 or 10 different little temporary markets set up all over the city in parks and churches and the courthouse square (that was the biggest one), with every one having a bunch of food stalls that varied from typical fair food to traditional offal dishes. I was working one year during Fiesta, and my 2 Latino coworkers let me come along to their favorite market for lunch, and told me what I should try from several different stalls.  That was my first time trying birria, which\u2026daaamn that stuff is good.  Lots of the food stalls were tiny little places run by local immigrants who only sold food for the festival, so there was a lot of variety, and some of it was amazing."]}
