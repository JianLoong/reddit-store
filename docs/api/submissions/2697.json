She'd have a cow over my grandmother's potica. That was a labor intensive holiday tradition in my family. Only took my aunt 10 years after Mama died to figure out how to make it, like Mama's. OP NTA.", "That sounds really good actually too. I\u2019ll have to try your recipe. Same thing with my step kids and even my nieces and nephews, they love that comfort food and still ask for it even though some of them are adults. \n\nYeah it really does suck because she went from that to \u201cwell what\u2019s going in the Turkey?? I stick to -\u201c type of stuff but I\u2019m glad we\u2019re just staying home with the kids and having our own thing", "It\u2019s a kid favorite with my family. Def try it! My oldest nephew is in college and he still asks grandma for it when she asks what he wants for breakfast when he visits haha. \n\nBut yes, I\u2019m really thankful he has my back. I always hear stories about the husband taking the moms side", "yes! the husband gets points here for standing up", "My Puerto Rician grandmother used to make me hotdogs and eggs when I was little and I loved it! I have really great memories of sitting at the table watching her cook. Fried bologna and eggs are good too!", "Look, Ive never had what you've described up there (but I will be trying it shortly. That sounds like the perfect lazy saturday morning treat!)\n\nBut growing up in Canada in the 80s: hotdogs chopped up in Kraft dinner was a normal lunch. And there wasnt even any fresh vegies in that!\n\nIt's perfectly normal to throw some nice easy hotdogs at kids once in a while. My cousins still serve all my little nibblings hotdogs in KD.", "I hosted at our house one year and made a cajun smoked turkey. No left overs! \n\nWe've had brisket, roast beef, lasagne because not every one likes turkey, or ham. \n\nI was giggling at the posters talking about the macaroni with hot dogs. Ugh, Mom would do that with cheez whiz because she couldn't cook for shit. Buddy and I used to laugh about how that was a white trash staple. (I've *never* had cheez whiz in my house)\n\nMy husband made himself a fried bologna sandwich one day and I thought, \"I haven't seen one of those in 50 years\". \n\nUsed to have a customer at a restaurant ask for a fried egg sandwich on the reg. \n\nOP is NTA. MIL is, though.", "So do you make it like where it just fits on bread? Is it kind of like an omelette? I want to make this", "We used to cut hotdogs length wise and fry them and serve them with eggs. I think anyone who has had a tight budget at some point in their life did recipes like this.  When i was a kid, shepards pie on Friday night was made to use up all the leftovers in the fridge from the week. We rarely have leftovers so make it from scratch now. NTA and I'm glad you told your husband.", "Yep. Breakfast sausages are basically hotdogs with different seasoning.", "Just imagine how insulted she would be when seeing a full English breakfast! Or or our german ones...\n\nShe is really ignorant.", "My white-as-snow family did fried bologna as a treat, with mustard and some macaroni. It was a childhood holdover from when Mom was a kid and there was a bit of extra money on the day they got paid for the milk they shipped so they could afford to buy meat at the grocer's. It's one of those meals that I still reach for when I want comfort food. Now I'll have to try doing it with eggs instead!", "That sounds absolutely delightful!", "I would LOVE to try curried stuffing", "that sounds amazing", "MIL is TA and i would love to be a fly on the wall when she explains why she\u2019s not doing thanksgiving to friends. $20 she doesn\u2019t actually tell them \u201cbecause it might be mexicanish\u201d, but gives a made up excuse.", "YUM"]}
