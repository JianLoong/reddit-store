Due to the nature of that schedule, all Tuesday's are her days.\n\nMy son wants to do a certain sport, that takes place always on Tuesday, same day as the hobby of our daughter.

We live in her home country, so I basically am living away from home, and don't have much support. When I have the kids, I'm on my own, and I usually don't have time to work my hours, so I need to catch up when I don't have them.\n\nFor that reason, when she initially asked me, I said I needed to think about it, and today I said I can take him on some days, but not regularly due to travels, catch up, etc.\n\nI basically think and said, it was her day, so it's her responsibility.\n\nShe went on a rant, told me how wrong I was, that I was cruel and egoistic, that I always prioritized my job over my kids, that I needed then to tell my son I didn't want to bring him, and that I didn't assume my responsibility as a father. It hurts, I think she's wrong, but she insists I am wrong. I don't know anymore. Am I egoistic? AITA?\n\nEDIT, for clarification:I have them 6 days out of 14.

It doesn\u2019t seem egotistical at all; it just seems like a lose lose situation for you both at the moment. Coparenting is hard and this is just one hurdle for y\u2019all.  I understand she doesn\u2019t want her day to be used for sports. But what you offered her seems very fair that you can help sometimes but not all the time. I think the next step is figuring out what she\u2019s really getting at- what resolution would make her happiest? What resolution would make you happiest? And how can y\u2019all meet in the middle to make sure the child is put first. Definitely NTA.", "NTA All parents have to juggle the demands of their jobs and the kids. Sometimes life demands a job change, this one isn\u2019t it.  Your wife is the one with the problem as the issue is occurring on a Tuesday when she has custody.

This way everyone wins.", "NTA. \n\nYou can't afford to lose your job for a 1 day activity; that's just not practical in the long run.

Mild because doing the driving isn\u2019t workable every week with job and travel, however, focusing on the custody element is letting your son down.\n\nThis is about supporting your son.
