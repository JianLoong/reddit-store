{"id": 7628, "submission_id": "10f3ao4", "title": "AITA for using my dog to scare a man who cat called me and followed me around for twenty minutes?", "selftext": "Okay so here\u2019s a little backstory first. I (18 f) have a pet Rottweiler named Juno, so Juno is the most loving dog I\u2019ve had him since I was 15 and he\u2019s always been the sweetest boy. I have to keep him muzzled though for a number of reasons. \n1: I live in New York and I don\u2019t want him eating anything off the dirty gross New York sidewalk/street. \n2: Juno is very anxious because we moved here forms small town in Canada and it was a very big change for him so he can sometimes act out and bark if he gets to overwhelmed. \n3: I get yelled at by wusses if he\u2019s not muzzled.  \nOkay so what happened was I was walking Juno around mid-day, and usually when I\u2019m walking Juno cat callers tend to ignore me because of my \u201cbig scary Rottweiler\u201d. But this particular man would not lay off he kept walking 15 feet behind me shouting profanity\u2019s, and I thought he would just let it go if I ignored him but he wouldn\u2019t.  \n\nHe followed me for around 20 minutes untill I came up with an idea to get him to leave. \n\nwhen I was 16 I taught Juno how to smile. So when I say the key word \u201csmile\u201d Juno will show me all his teeth. And to anyone but me it looks very threatening .   \n\nSo what I did was I turned around looked at this man then looked at Juno and slowly unbuckled his muzzle while looking at the man. Then I pulled my phone out and pointed my camera at this man and said \u201csmile\u201d to make Juno show his teeth and I let go of his leash and stood on it with one foot.  Juno then showed all of his teeth the man just looked at me wide eyed because to him it looked like Juno was ready to attack. So I gave this man a friendly little smirk and said \u201cif you don\u2019t want me to take my foot off of this leash I suggest you smile the leave me the f*ck alone\u201d the man then sprinted off telling me me I\u2019m a \u201ccrazy b*tch\u201d then i put my dogs muzzle back on him and ignored all the looks I was getting and finished my walk.   \n\nThen later I told my friend about this incident, and he told me that I shouldn\u2019t be weaponizing my dog to scare some confused old man who probably would\u2019ve left eventually.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m here typing this out in my room with Juno at the end of my bed thinking, maybe I was in the wrong.   \nSo what I\u2019m wondering is, AITA for using my dog to scare a man who cat called me and followed me around for twenty minutes?", "created_utc": 1674034656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f3ao4/aita_for_using_my_dog_to_scare_a_man_who_cat/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This one cares more about the hurt feelings of your harasser than about your safety.", "NTA. We all know who the AH is and it's not you. It was clearly a last resort. \n\nYou might want to be careful about people reporting a \"dangerous dog\", though.", "NTA he wasn't a 'confused old man' he was a fucking creep who was *already* scaring *you*. Excellent solution tbh.", "NTA he doesnt understand that you were in a scary and possibly dangerous situation, he doesn't know that man might have left and you shouldn't have to put up with harassment and stalking because it might be a confused old man and let's face it that wasn't the case.\n\n\n\nYour friend and that guy are the assholes", "NTA. Fuck that noise. The dude followed you for 20 minutes, but would have left you alone later?  Who the fuck thinks like that? Awesome  image in my mind of your dog smiling.", "NtA. That was a perfect response. Nothing was hurt other than his pride and he definitely needed to be taken down a peg", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t weaponize Juno. You did what you needed to feel safe. \n\nThe only AH was creepy stalker dude.\n\nYoung woman in NYC can\u2019t be too careful.", "You didn't train your dog to be aggressive . That man harassed you for 20mins he deserved what you did. Surprised no one else told that man to back off being a creep.", "NTA. Your friend has no idea what it is like to be followed and harassed on the street for 20 minutes.", "NTA\n\nI have an uncle who is currently a literal confused old man as he\u2019s began experiencing the beginning stages of dementia, trust me when i tell you there is no universe in which he could manage to follow someone for 20 minutes straight. Please seek out new friends - give Juno a treat for us and if you\u2019re feeling extra kind pay the dog tax and let us see the good boy haha!\n\nAny person deflecting the situation does not know what it\u2019s like to be followed and harassed, you can\u2019t excuse such evidently malicious behaviour. I really hope your friend has a serious reflection on that thought process, send him this post if he needs to see everyone else agreeing with you \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA , he deserved to feel scared after making you feel like that", "NTA NTA NTA - Anyone who is catcalling/harassing you is a legitimate threat even if he does seem like a \u201cconfused old man who probably would\u2019ve left occasionally\u201d. He was acting crazy by being a predator, you simply stood up for your safety. He\u2019s lucky no one has pulled a weapon on him yet acting like that, hopefully karma takes him out.", "NTA, and give Juno a biscuit.", "NTA\n\nI don't even have to read past the title. You do whatever you need to to protect yourself. You didn't even harm the man so in hindsight you didn't really do anything wrong. \n\nThe man was following you.. I'm glad you got home and had Juno there too , god knows what else wouldve happened. \n\nDon't listen to anyone who tells you you're an asshole for it. You protected yourself, you didn't harm him either. You did NOTHING wrong.", "NTA that\u2019s amazing, men should learn not to be predators and should not think it\u2019s okay to assault women verbally or physically. Stalking and following women is also really bad and it\u2019s terrifying and super messed up that they get away with this stuff so thank you for putting one pervert in his place, he may think twice before he does it to another woman .", "NTA, and also, f*ck your friend, maybe reassess your friendship with this schdouchebag, clearly doesn\u2019t give a F about your wellbeing", "Nta. I'm betting your 'friend' is male and doesn't understand how much women have to deal with jsut walking around.", "NTA. That guy was harassing you with possible poor intentions. You did what you needed to to protect yourself.", "NTA and good for you.", "NTA, your dog didn\u2019t do the man any actual harm and there was no other way you could\u2019ve stopped that man from harassing you. And i disagree with your friend, 20 mins is a pretty long time and judging from the man\u2019s actions he clearly wasn\u2019t some \u201cconfused old man\u201d", "NTA . The man was the asshole and a creep.", "Your friend sounds like the type of man who would also harass and cat call.\n\nThis could have ended MUCH worse than it did.

Scare him the fuck off.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I would be concerned about whether your friend needs educating.\n\n\"Probably an old man\" the heck!? That really wound me up", "NTA, and nice job, lol. That was an absolutely flawless response, and I hope that near-stalker will learn from this. Good boy Juno.", "NTA. Well done actually.", "NTA. The man was harassing you, that\u2019s a crime. Kudos to you for being calm and now you know what to do next time. Good work.", "NTA- Being a woman in a busy city, being followed, cat called, and harassed is an every day occurrence. What is less common, is a woman standing up for herself, utilizing all of the resources she has to get away from a potentially dangerous situation. Women and girls have been kidnapped and raped for walking down streets, doing normal everyday things. Anyone who would fault, or blame you for getting away from something that made your spidey senses tingle, needs a wake up. \n\nNever be ashamed for making a decision to get out of a bad situation. It can mean your life. Keep mace, and always be situationally aware. Don\u2019t walk down streets with your nose in your phone. Keep your headphones out of one ear, so you can still hear. \n\nSource- I was one of those victims I talked about.", "> Then later I told my friend about this incident, and he told me that I shouldn\u2019t be weaponizing my dog to scare some confused old man who probably would\u2019ve left eventually.\n\nhe followed you for 20 minutes lol he wasn't going away anytime soon.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - very clever. Good for you.  Pay a strange man to follow him around when he's by himself and catcall him and see if he just ignores it.", "Ur friend doesn\u2019t give good advice. Good work Juno! Give him a treat for it", "NTA. Your friend (and I use that word advisedly, he doesn't sound like a friend at all) obviously has absolutely no idea what it's like to have someone follow you around, sexually harassing you, for half an hour or more. HE has no clue how uncomfortable it is that you can't even go home in a situation like that, because you don't want to risk leading a stalker to your residence. HE is out of line to get on your case for defending yourself against unwanted attention; you don't owe some asshole guy you meet on the street a smile & an ass wiggle just because he wants to see it, & a civilized human being wouldn't demand it in the first place.", "NTA!\nFuck that guy, he deserved to be scared.\nHe's probably made heaps of women uncomfortable and/or scared with his gross behaviour. His turn to see how intimidating a stranger can be.", ">Then later I told my friend about this incident, and he told me that I shouldn\u2019t be weaponizing my dog to scare some confused old man who probably would\u2019ve left eventually.\n\nNTA, but your friend surely is. Let's stop once and for all justifying harassers, stalkers and old slobbers. \n\nOne just asks to be left alone, it's not asking for the moon.", "\"Confused old man\" eh... no... we don't act like he didn't know.", "NTA and this was EPIC!!! You\u2019re friend is man(assuming from the he) and does not know how it feels to be treated this way. That man could of been dangerous and they way he was acting surely was. You did the right thing!!!", "I was telling my friend the other day about how I bark at creepy men to freak them out when trying to get in my space m. I\u2019ve been doing it all wrong I realize. I need a Juno in my life. My basset hounds are not the intimidating presence Juno and I are.", "NTA and I would seriously think about dumping that friend they clearly don't give a shit about your safety.", "NTA. Nicely done. \n\nYour \"friend\" just told on himself as being a creeper who doesn't respect women. Dump him.", "Confused old men don't follow women for 20 minutes and catcall them. Dogs are supposed to protect their owners, so your dog was just being the best dog and if it was the only wag to jake him go away, then that's his fault. \n\nNTA Your friend probably catcalls women. Only predators oppose protecting yourself. It's not weaponizing, it's keeping yourself safe, which you have every right to be safe and nobody has the right to oppose you being safe.", "NTA for scaring away a harrasser in a way that was smart, resourceful, and harmless to all people involved.\n\n I would, in the future, be careful for the sake of your dog. New York is a big place, so I doubt it would happen there as much, but if a dog gets a reputation, it can cause trouble for the dog. As my uncle says, \"A dog known to bite is a dog that gets put down.\" A sad fact and something he said the stop a young cousin from \"showing off\" by saying his dog bite people when the dog doesn't have an aggressive none in its body and tries to befriend birds. But his breed plus people saying things like that = more likely to be put down.\n\nI'm not saying your dog ever would, but with his breed already intimidating people (which sucks because in my experience, they're big lovable potatos who drool a little much) if incidents like this happen more, he could gain a reputation for \"being aggressive\"", "Definitely NTA but your \"friend\" sure is TA next to the AH who was following you.\n\nI'm sorry that a person you thought was a friend turned out to be a creep.\n\nYou were being followed by someone who was acting in a threatening manner and yelling out some vile, nasty things to you...for almost a HALF HOUR.\n\nAnd this guy who is supposed to be your friend called the guy a confused old man.\n\nHe blamed you, the victim, for defending yourself.", "NTA he wasn't a confused old man he was a creep, and I loooooove what you did lol maybe he will think twice about following someone else though they rarely learn", "NTA, dude was at best being a creep, you stood your ground he could've been dangerous hopefully he won't do that ever again (sadly I find that unlikely).", "NTA. The only thing wrong i can see is that you waited a whole 20 minutes to scare the creep away! \n\nYour friend's reaction is very suspect. You deserve better friends that that. Friends who actually have your back.", "NTA you did what was needed to bring safe. Glad you are also very protective of Juno. Rotties are such goofballs when at home and comfortable. Mine was Atticus. \n\nNow of course your tax fee is due. Dog tax .... pictures please! Would love to see one of Junos smile!", "NTA, you were being followed and harassed! You knew Juno wouldn't do anything and that you were giving the command to smile for him, not the guy harassing you.  \n\nMight I suggest also carrying mace or a self-defense tool with you since this seems to be a common theme? Safety is important. Just make sure you check your local laws for what is and isn't legal.  For example where I live, women can carry spiked safety key chain,  but men can't as it's then considered a weapon.", "Your title is wrong.\n\n\"AITA for using my dog to scare of the man who harassed me, dehumanized me, and stalked me for 20 minutes\"\n\nThere I fixed it for you. \n\nNTA, people need to learn to leave people alone. If this guy wanted to try and flirt with you and talk to you, that is one thing, but following someone and cursing at them for 20 min? nah, he earned what he got.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
