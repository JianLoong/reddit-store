I (18 f) have a pet Rottweiler named Juno, so Juno is the most loving dog I\u2019ve had him since I was 15 and he\u2019s always been the sweetest boy. I have to keep him muzzled though for a number of reasons. \n1: I live in New York and I don\u2019t want him eating anything off the dirty gross New York sidewalk/street. \n2: Juno is very anxious because we moved here forms small town in Canada and it was a very big change for him so he can sometimes act out and bark if he gets to overwhelmed. \n3: I get yelled at by wusses if he\u2019s not muzzled.  \nOkay so what happened was I was walking Juno around mid-day, and usually when I\u2019m walking Juno cat callers tend to ignore me because of my \u201cbig scary Rottweiler\u201d. But this particular man would not lay off he kept walking 15 feet behind me shouting profanity\u2019s, and I thought he would just let it go if I ignored him but he wouldn\u2019t.  \n\nHe followed me for around 20 minutes untill I came up with an idea to get him to leave. \n\nwhen I was 16 I taught Juno how to smile. So when I say the key word \u201csmile\u201d Juno will show me all his teeth. And to anyone but me it looks very threatening .   \n\nSo what I did was I turned around looked at this man then looked at Juno and slowly unbuckled his muzzle while looking at the man. Then I pulled my phone out and pointed my camera at this man and said \u201csmile\u201d to make Juno show his teeth and I let go of his leash and stood on it with one foot.  Juno then showed all of his teeth the man just looked at me wide eyed because to him it looked like Juno was ready to attack. So I gave this man a friendly little smirk and said \u201cif you don\u2019t want me to take my foot off of this leash I suggest you smile the leave me the f*ck alone\u201d the man then sprinted off telling me me I\u2019m a \u201ccrazy b*tch\u201d then i put my dogs muzzle back on him and ignored all the looks I was getting and finished my walk.   \n\nThen later I told my friend about this incident, and he told me that I shouldn\u2019t be weaponizing my dog to scare some confused old man who probably would\u2019ve left eventually.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m here typing this out in my room with Juno at the end of my bed thinking, maybe I was in the wrong.   \nSo what I\u2019m wondering is, AITA for using my dog to scare a man who cat called me and followed me around for twenty minutes?", "created_utc": 1674034656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f3ao4/aita_for_using_my_dog_to_scare_a_man_who_cat/", "score": 937, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

New York is a big place, so I doubt it would happen there as much, but if a dog gets a reputation, it can cause trouble for the dog.

But his breed plus people saying things like that = more likely to be put down.\n\nI'm not saying your dog ever would, but with his breed already intimidating people (which sucks because in my experience, they're big lovable potatos who drool a little much) if incidents like this happen more, he could gain a reputation for \"being aggressive\"", "Definitely NTA but your \"friend\" sure is TA next to the AH who was following you.\n\nI'm sorry that a person you thought was a friend turned out to be a creep.\n\nYou were being followed by someone who was acting in a threatening manner and yelling out some vile, nasty things to you...for almost a HALF HOUR.\n\nAnd this guy who is supposed to be your friend called the guy a confused old man.\n\nHe blamed you, the victim, for defending yourself.", "NTA he wasn't a confused old man he was a creep, and I loooooove what you did lol maybe he will think twice about following someone else though they rarely learn", "NTA, dude was at best being a creep, you stood your ground he could've been dangerous hopefully he won't do that ever again (sadly I find that unlikely).", "NTA. The only thing wrong i can see is that you waited a whole 20 minutes to scare the creep away! \n\nYour friend's reaction is very suspect. You deserve better friends that that.

You knew Juno wouldn't do anything and that you were giving the command to smile for him, not the guy harassing you.  \n\nMight I suggest also carrying mace or a self-defense tool with you since this seems to be a common theme? Safety is important. Just make sure you check your local laws for what is and isn't legal.  For example where I live, women can carry spiked safety key chain,  but men can't as it's then considered a weapon.", "Your title is wrong.\n\n\"AITA for using my dog to scare of the man who harassed me, dehumanized me, and stalked me for 20 minutes\"\n\nThere I fixed it for you. \n\nNTA, people need to learn to leave people alone.

I have two large boxers. Friendly as all get out. I have no idea how they would be behave if I were attacked or frightened. I have them on leashes with harnesses to control them.

I'm sure it's adorable!", "NTA for taking care of yourself, but... dog tax?  We need pictures of the goodest boy Juno!", "NTA. Amazing how people think it\u2019s okay for men to follow women around. That can get dangerous. For the record, while I love Rottweilers and I think it\u2019s adorable and hilarious that you taught your dog to smile and used that to your advantage in this situation, be careful. Rottweilers are scary-looking to a lot of people (which you know), and using Juno like that could be a problem for you both.

You were careless here to drop the leash.\n\nI agree with your friend's comment that you weaponized your dog, but not when he said basically said he would have left you alone eventually.
