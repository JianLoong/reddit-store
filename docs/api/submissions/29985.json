Nor is it helpful.\n\nIf you believe that handling such a situation in this way will actually help and not create further strife, then  good luck with that.\n\nSometimes, proving yourself right and doing the right thing are two different paths. The path you decide to take should be based upon what you value most. \n\nIs it proving to the other person that you are \"right\" about the situation? Or is it preserving your relationship with the person who is hurt by it?\n\nIf it's proving yourself right, be prepared to accept that this is unlikely to help and may cause further damage to the relationship.\n\nIf it's preserving the relationship, simply offer an apology without saying what you did was wrong, as per the example in my previous comment.", "Awww\n\nMy kids were flower girl/boy last year and the boy fell asleep on my dad's lap about 10 min after he did his job \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 slept for over an hour, my dad couldn't put him down (chose not to put him down)", "My brain went immediately to Jeff, the guy who wore basketball shorts and a sweatshirt every day of middle school.\n\nNo idea why he's the only one I think of, but that's the face that pops into my head when someone mentions that clothing combo\ud83e\udd23", "\"Sorry you stubbed your toe\" is too wild for you? I see the problem. You never talk to other human beings.\n\nAnd if you're going to talk about \"proper English\", don't have a comma splice in your comment ;)"]}
