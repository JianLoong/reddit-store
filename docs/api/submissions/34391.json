I grew up with the same two of everything situation, and it was exhausting. When I was old enough to sign my name to things, my dad wrote the child support checks out to me because he hated writing them to my mom. He never could understand that her using it on utility bills or the mortgage meant she was actually using it for what was intended. I guess he thought a 10 year old knew best what she needed to survive. /s\n\nIt got worse when I had my first child. Each of my parents insisted on \"their own Christmas\". My husband and I set strict boundaries after our son's first Christmas. Everything with my parents is a battle. My dad and I are NC. The relationship with my mom becomes more complicated as she ages. Some people should not marry and have children together. My husband has always had my back in dealing with them and stepped in when needed. His family, while not perfect, are amazing and go with the flow.\n\nI completely understand your stance on this and being unwilling to placate family members on either side. If seeing your son and celebrating him is truly important, then they can suck it up and be politely distant for an hour or so at a birthday party. Otherwise, they can explain to him why petty arguments are more important than him when he is old enough to figure out why they're not there. My dad is missing out on knowing his amazing grandsons, but he made that choice. Your husband needs to understand that his mom and aunt are each making a choice.", "NTA. When the adults who claim to love this child behave as if they are younger than the toddler to be celebrated with petty arguments over things that have nothing to do with a child\u2019s birthday celebration- then they don\u2019t need to be included. The end. Don\u2019t make extra birthday lunches or times to celebrate with the absent relatives. Don\u2019t cater to people who are determined to make your life more difficult. And, if you like petty, post a group birthday picture on social media tagging and thanking those that came for celebrating your little one.

You invited everyone and made it abundantly clear that all relatives were invited. As you stated, MIL is the one who chose to not attend and be an adult for one afternoon.

That does carry some weight when compared to a great-aunt.\n\nEDIT: wording", "Esh why are you deciding about your husband's relatives?  You're allowing your own trauma to dictate and basically not giving your husband a voice about his own family.

Birthday invitations probably shouldn't come with admonitions. You can't fix this situation. They are responsible for their own responses, not you or your husband.", "YTA\n\nBut gently. You have some residual trauma that you are projecting onto your kid's situation, so it's understandable.\n\nBut you're wrong here. Your husband decides who from his side of the family should be invited, and he wants his parents over his aunt. Frankly, grandparents come before great aunts.

They are your child's grandparents.  I agree they are being extremely immature.  But again, I don't think it's right that you make the decision without your husband's input.  I think it needs to be a joint decision.\n\nEssentially, your husband wants his parents there more than his sister.

Enjoy your son's birthday and to hell with anyone else who is upset.", "NTA\n\nGotta love it when the adults are less mature than the kids. \n\nThis is going to become a reoccurring problem.

This is the right way to approach this, I think. Let the adults handle their feelings and choices. It's not up to you to play this game. It's too hard, and if you start now, you'll never be rid of it. Think of the school plays or games or graduations ahead.", "Nta.

Isn't that so sad?\"", "Your child's grandmother cannot even just ignore her sister for a couple of hours for the sake of a child. Says it all.\n\nI think your stance is reasonable and it applies to everyone equally. They are indeed excluding themselves.", "NTA. You are acting like a rational adult. While I see your husband\u2019s point that a grandma trumps a great aunt, you didn\u2019t exclude your MIL. You simply didn\u2019t pander to her wishes. She has chosen to exclude herself. That\u2019s on her.\n\nOne question you haven\u2019t addressed is why is MIL so antagonistic toward her sister. Did the aunt have an affair with husband\u2019s dad? Steal MIL\u2019s boyfriend? You need to know whether you are backing the right horse.", "NTA I agree with you - I do not talk or see my Uncle and his family at all and have skipped some events. That is my decision, no one else's. Does it really seem appropriate to your husband that his parents have to approve who is coming to someone else's house? Are they will to give you any guest list to things you're invited to and you can let them know who they're allowed to invite? Does it sound worse when I put it that way? It should because that's ridiculous", "NTA. It's your child's birthday.  You invited who you wanted to invite.  Anyone who can't tolerate being around your other guests should stay home.", "NTA- your husband needs to stop catering to his parents and tell his mother to grow up.

You are the host, you set the intentions early \"Everyone is invited and if you decide not to come because you cannot be polite for 3 hours for a child's celebration, that is your choice.\"\n\nYour husband needs to grow a spine. His parents can learn to be polite to another family member in a group setting or they can not come. They CHOSE not to come. They decided their feud was more important than his child, which is tough to realize. And he may not even have thought of it this way.", "NTA - I admire your position. I had a similar point of view when my daughter graduated from high school. My mother refused to be in a STADIUM (20,000 people) with my dad. I told her that I was sad but I respected her choice. Practice those words. You're going to need them.", "NTA. You are a great mom for not letting adult conflicts cause problems for your son. If they can\u2019t be civil to each other then they can\u2019t come.", "NTA As you say, \u201cThey could just be adults.\u201d", "NTA. You can choose the event that you want and invite who you want when you're hosting. Anyone invited who doesn't like the guest list can graciously decline and throw their own event with a guest list they approve of.

They s/b a priority.  The grandparents are not making your son a priority.  They are making the disruption between them the priority.  They s/b able to survive 3 hours at a party being cordial.  They are adults ffs  & they're acting like children.  Tell them to grow up & get over it.  Why is this beef they have more important than making your son happy?", "Yes my parents hate each other but they both show up to my daughter\u2019s bday parties. Also, my 2 neices who won\u2019t have anything to do with their half sister and their dad\u2019s girlfriend also all show up for my daughter\u2019s birthdays.

If husband and I were divorced and HE wanted to throw one separately, then I\u2019d understand but there\u2019s no reason for a grandparent to throw another bday\u2026.

She\u2019s a social media grandma. She loves posting pictures of my son and gushing about how cute he is and how much she misses him but the last vacation we all took together, which was like 3-4 days, she spent maybe 2 hours with him over the course of those days. Instead, she spent most of her time with FIL\u2019s siblings and interacting with my son when convenient for her.", "I can\u2019t stand being around my sisters.

You are firm and clear and with good reasoning.", "I am not sure that it does undermine it. Even before my divorce, we would throw bdays or do Christmas or whatever and when a grandparent couldn't make something they would often do a mini version of the holiday at their house. This is pretty common. Most people experience this and it can be done and handled in a non-custodial feeling way. \n\nNow, post-divorce, my kids often have multiple bday and holiday get-togethers. My exhusband and I coparent very well and do many things together but recognize that after 8 years the kids and parents have distinct different sets of friends and such where holding a massive bday with both sides at once would be overwhelming to the point of unpleasant for everyone. We work hard to be flexible with scheduling and listening to the kids wants. We have 50/50 custody but we shuffle days and times around as needed without really paying attention to total amounts of time spent with each parent. Including the fact that we do scouts and our son's scout meeting is on dad's day but I am the scouting parent, so I pick him up and we go to his meetings and then I drop him back at dad's after. Dad could choose to be a dick because technically it is on his time, but it isn't about time it is about the kids and making sure they are happy and doing the things they want to do.\n\nChristmas, for example, has fallen into a set rhythm based on the kids (10 & 14) request to be with dad for Christmas morning and mom Christmas day/night and not go to any grandparents Christmas day because it is too much.  So they are with their dad for Christmas Eve where they go visit his parents and stay overnight with him to do Christmas morning there, he drops the kids off at my house whenever feels comfortable and isn't rushing them (my only request is no later than 5), once they get to my house we do our Christmas and relax the rest of the day. We visit my parents on the 26th or 27th and do Christmas with them based on whatever works for people's lives.", "And I can totally understand her thoughts with that. I didn\u2019t have a bad divorce experience so to me I just loved getting two of everything, I had adults around me who adulted correctly though.", "[deleted]", "See I don\u2019t that being the hill. \n\nTo me, she\u2019s been good to us and my son. She\u2019s been just as present in his life if not MORE than MIL. And I think not inviting her just because MIL doesn\u2019t want to see her would be such an insult. Idk\u2026.. I see where you\u2019re coming from though! Thanks for the alternate thought process!", "[deleted]", "Then I wouldn\u2019t genuinely consider what to do.

Nothing wrong with a small party though.", "NTA. I'm kinda loving this post. GOOD ON YOU! This is an EXTREMELY  important boundary and precedent to set. The family dynamics you want to exemplify to your child should definitely be established early and continue going forward.  No people don't have to like each other, but yes if they want to be apart of these occasions they do have to at least pretend or make an effort to get along...it really isn't that hard. Their messiness is theirs and they can handle it privately or not at all, but it shouldn't be part of other people's business. My family treats those situations like business transactions,  it like if I hated my coworkers,   I don't bitch about them in the office or bad mouth them at social events,I  show up for meetings and am cordial...it's called being a respectful grownup.it might seem trite but it works. You'll be showing your little guy how people should be treated even when it's difficult. Hopefully they'll learn to coexist if not for their sake at least for his. I would imagine( or hope) that they'll realize they are only punishing themselves by missing these moments by holding on to petty resentments.

My son finally lost it and told his Dad if you can't be an adult then don't come. So his Dad skipped quite a lot for bout 5 years. Then his Dad married wife #5...she's a really nice lady and we all like her. So now for all 5 of my oldest sons kids stuff they have his Dad, his wife, Me, my current husband, my 2nd husband (he and I raised my oldest together but divorced when oldest was 12 but is still an active person in my son's and his families lives). Is it fun for me having 2 ex husbands and a current husband at everything...sometimes not...does any of that matter to my son or his kids? Nope...so we all go and we all get along...not the norm I'm sure but my son laid down the law and we either abide by it or we don't go.
