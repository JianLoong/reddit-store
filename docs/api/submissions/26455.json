During the pandemic, my wife's job allowed her to switch to 100% WFH.  They never required her to go back to the office because her productivity actually increased so there was no need.  It made things easier for us too.  I dropped the kids off at school/daycare in the morning and she picked them up in the afternoon.  She was able to keep up with a few things around the house during the day, we saved on gas and car maintenance, etc.\n\nA few months ago, she was contacted by a recruiter about a job.  It would be a nice step up in her career path as well as a boost in pay.  But there were drawbacks.  The company had no WFH policy and would require her to work in the office.  This was apparently non-negotiable.  It would also be a 45-minute commute for her.\n\nWe talked it over a lot and I expressed my concerns about how this would impact our daily lives.  I told her that I don't necessarily think that the bump in pay is worth the major changes to our daily lives.  Not to mention the stress that a long commute can have on people and that could impact their mood and how they interact at home.\n\nShe assured me that everything would be fine and that we would adjust as a family and soon the new routine would just become our new normal.  I told her that I would never tell her NOT to take the job, but I just don't know if it is worth the changes that it is going to bring.  Ultimately, the decision was hers and she accepted the new job.  She's been there for about 10 weeks now.\n\nTo say it has been an adjustment is an understatement.  She wakes up and leaves before the kids even get up.  She'll help get a few things ready for them before she goes, but the entire morning kid routine is on me.  I also do both drop-off and pick-up for all the kids too.  Evenings have been a huge mess because I get home and try to get the kids distracted while I start dinner.  When my wife gets home, she is usually stressed from the drive (her commute has turned into over an hour due to construction and traffic) and takes 15 minutes for herself to calm down before eating alone.  Then, after dinner she's going to bed earlier because she has to wake up earlier.\n\nI told her that I feel her new job has put an unfair amount of household and childcare duties on me and that she is being far less present in our lives when she's home.  She told me that we just need to give it more time to adjust and things will get easier.  I told her that 10-weeks is a pretty good adjustment period and I hate it so far.  She told me I'm being an unsupportive jerk and I need to give it more time.\n\nEDIT: I don't have the emotional bandwidth right now to deal with the huge amount of sexist BS I'm getting here.  Those kind of responses are why men don't open up when they feel EXACTLY like I do right now and just bottle this up.  I have to get ready to pick up my kids.  They're getting happy meals tonight because f\\*&\\^ it.

I doubt she can just frivolously quit the new job after just 10 weeks.", "ESH. You two are talking past each other. You say you wanted to come up with solutions but you don\u2019t suggest any actual solutions. She was dismissive of your concerns and also didn\u2019t suggest any solutions. She\u2019s making more money, use that to outsource some of this stuff.\n\nAs a general matter, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect that over the course of a lifetime, your spouse\u2019s career will never require you to pick up the slack at home. These things tend to shift. She handled more stuff while she was wfh, now it\u2019s your turn. If it\u2019s unsustainable for you then absolutely talk about solutions. But \u201cI hate it!\u201d is not a solution.", "You had the first talk, great. Now you need to both sit down and agree what you want life to look like now. Who does what and when.", "Info: How shared was the housework and childcare before she started this job? Asking to clarify because a lot of people are assuming you did nothing after you got home from work.", "Info: what were you doing before the pandemic? What was the routine when she wasn\u2019t working from home? How did you manage?", "I have had a job where I worked long hours and didn\u2019t get paid well.  Now in my career I am doing more interesting work, getting paid well, and largely setting my own hours.  It\u2019s wonderful and my SO loves it too.  But those earlier years led up to this new job.  I had to pay my dues to get where I am now.  Guessing by your and your wife\u2019s age, and from your reference to her job being an advance in her career, it sounds like this might be the kind of job where she is setting herself up for a better situation in the future.  Try to work out some compromises now, and hang in there.", "Info: what are her working hours? If she works a 9-5 are you saying your kids are not awake by 8am and she is going to bed at 7pm?\n\nI used to have a 45 min to 1 hour commute, it's not that bad. In fact I'd anticipate most working adults pre-pandemic had similar commutes.", "A) The kids are old enough to do shit themselves. My 3yo helps put his clothes out the night before, and brings me his water bottle/ lunch box etc. \n\nThe 8yo puts out their clothing; makes their lunch, snack, and sets their desired bf item out; does their water bottle.... everything the night before. Plus their bag together....\n\nThe 8yo also helps the 3yo get dressed. And then I finish it up.... ALL OF US are out the house in about 40 min. And that's including walking the dog. \n\nAlso why is it hard to occupy the kids while you make dinner? That's a parenting problem. One that's EASY to fix. Listen, kids are in school ALL day. They need to decompress too. New rule.  After school everyone grabs a snack and head to their own rooms. Doors get closed and you set a timer for 1hr. You don't have to nap but you can't come out. The rule is to play quietly or read in your room for 1hr to decompress. Even the 6yo can do it, I promise. \n\nB) Meal prep. Prep on the weekend for the whole week. Slow cooker meals are your friends and automate ANYTHING you can. \n\nC) Curbside is your friend. Schedule it for pickup on the way home; or order out to be shipped. Cut out as many errands as you can. \n\nAnd give her a break.  Yes it's hard for you too but I promise the adjustment is killing her.  I went from wake up at 7am wfh all day to pick up kids at 3 and DONE completely with my day by 330 to Up at 530am and don't get home from work after the commute til 630pm. It's exhausting going from 8hrs to 13. My change from WFH wasn't by choice tho.", "NTA. I don't understand the people saying it's your time to do it, when you've pointed out the fact that before her new job, you both used to split the kids' routine together and I don't see what the issue is with keeping up with housework since she worked from home. It seems like you had a good dynamic going on and balanced teamwork.", "NAH. But here are some suggestions. If you can afford it do an after school program. Like a local boys and girls club, ymca, or see if you have a parks & recreation program. This after school all the kids are dropped off at same location & then they can picked up at same time.Where I live we have all 3 programs and buses pick them up from school. I think pre cook everything on the weekend or pre prep foods on the weekend, so all you have to do is throw in oven. Frozen meals are okay. Cereal for dinner is ok. \n\nIf you can afford it hire a babysitter who can do pick up and start meals for you. Y\u2019all have options, but y\u2019all need to figure out how to communicate with each other. My house gets heavy cleaned every other week. I sweep, mop and make sure bathrooms are sanitized every week, but heavy cleaning done every other week. Your children are at age where they can help. They can do their own laundry and put it away. I was doing basic cleaning by the time I was 5. I could make a grill cheese sandwich and soup by time I was 10, for the family. Get your children to help. This is great time to start teaching basic life skills. Just remember things do not need to be perfect.", "I don\u2019t even know where to start. Your kids are old enough to help. Laundry all 3 can help. They can all sort clothes and help fold and put them away. (I am a crazy person I do not like other people touching my washing machine so it was hard to let my kids do that, even though they know how to use it). The kids are all old enough to help clean house. I am. It talking deep cleaning but they can pick up trash, sweep the floor, help set the table etc. \n\nMeal prep on weekends become a family affair.  Your wife did a lot when she was working from home. And you seem to resent the fact that there is more falling on you and I am sure you voice it to the kids. And the kids are mimicking what you are saying.\n\nYou and your wife need to talk to each other and need to listen to each other.", "I was on the fence (considering N A H) but your comments have convinced me YTA. Your situation is not unique, tons of kids grow up with one parent being less present due to their career. She's going through a career transition and you are being unsupportive.", "YTA. 10 weeks isn't long enough to adjust a whole family to a new routine, nor for your wife to settle in at the job and get used to the commute, change in sleep schedule. Jobs are extra tiring when you're new and learning on a curve, you gotta cut her a little bit of a break.\n\nWork together to find solutions, all sorts of families deal with similar work situations, it's possible.\n\nDon't just tell her she shouldn't get a chance to give the new job a fair shake or guilt her into quitting. She deserves a chance to persue her career goals. Maybe instead you can take a step back at your job? Maybe you can reduce your hours or work from home.\n\nI grew up never seeing my dad before work in the morning, we have a great relationship to this day. My mom got us ready for school and back from school and ran a home daycare at the same time. You can do this, you just need to adjust, as a couple.\n\nYour 10yo should be able to get themself ready for school. The younger kids can be shown how to prep the night before - school bag is ready, clothes picked out. Mom's home during this time - maybe it's a task she can do with them. \n\nKids can help with dinner even at 6yo. They can set the table, help unload the dishwasher, etc as age appropriate. They also should be able to entertain themselves after school. You can work through this, together. Make a plan. Assess the distribution of work together.", "NAH - You shared the responsibilities when she was WFH And I think that it's fair that it does need to be slightly more equal than it is.\n\nObviously, she physically can't do pick up and drop off but she could pick up different responsibilities. \n\nAlso she's been at the job for ten weeks - is there any flexibility in the hours at all?\n\nA lot of corporates etc are trying to be at least a little more accomodating of parents these days (sadly because it's the trend and they know they have to compete for their ideal candidates, rather than out of the goodness of their hearts).\n\nThey might not but it's worth ruling it out.", "Why don\u2019t you switch to WFH for a while? Then you could keep on top of the house while she is out at work, and with the money saved from gas etc you could pay someone to drop the kids at school in the morning?", "You\u2019re getting the work that women have done since the Dawn of time", "NAH. 10 weeks isn\u2019t long enough to adjust to a big change. \n\nI firmly believe life is rarely 50/50. Sounds like she was picking up a hit more while she was WFH, now you\u2019re picking up a bit more while she\u2019s commuting. Chances are it\u2019ll shift again in the future.\n\nKids can watch telly or play quietly while you cook dinner. Make liberal use of the slow cooker, freezer, and quick food. Wife does morning and evenings at the weekend since you do it during the week. Kids are old enough to help around the house.\n\nKeep talking to each other, give everyone time to settle into the new situation. You\u2019ll get there.", "NAH I think you both need to continue to have discussions about the change. 10 weeks isn't that long to adjust to a new schedule. You've made good points and should continue to discuss how to make this work.\n\nSeeing what can be done on weekends to make the work week easier. Finding time to spend with the kids more. Honestly I don't know how both my parents worked and made dinner every night and found time to do homework with us. But I do know how, it was just hard work. My brother and I got dropped off early at school which had people that watched kids who needed to get dropped off early and stayed late at the same place. My parents stayed up later and sometimes one parent was watching us while the other had a break. It got easier as we got older.", "Use the pay bump to hire a mother's helper to pick the kids up from school, start homework and start dinner. Talk to the part time teachers and paraprofessionals at their school to see if anyone is interested - they're ideal because they're already at the school and often appreciate a bump in cash flow. A friend hired a steady stream of first year art teachers this way and they were wonderful.\n\nYou and your wife each prep two dinners a week and have them in the fridge for the after school helper to stick in the oven. Not Your Mother's Slowcooker Recipes and Nom Nom Paleo InstaPot Recipe books are both brilliant for this. Fridays are pizza delivery and movies.", "YTA. Why is it too much to expect men to support their partner's advancement and career when women do it all. the. time. Suck it up, soldier. They are your children, too.", "I was with you until I saw your comments.\n\nQuote: Those things have already happened without purposely doing them.  The quality of meals I'm cooking for the kids is not to the quality my wife previously prepared.  The house is not nearly as clean, laundry is more backed up, the yard is in worse shape, etc.  Nothing in our lives, including our bank account, have improved with this new job.\n\nThis is weaponized incompetence. YTA for expecting things to just be the same and not step up to the standards your wife has set. It's time for you to learn to cook better, clean better and manage your time better.\n\nYou also said it feels like your wife isn't being present as a parent. And you sarcastically said you'd tell your children that it's not Mommy's turn to parent. You sound like a whiny petulant child yourself. This was a step up for your wife and you're pooping over it because you can't handle being up to standards. Poor wife and kids.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Man is just finding out what parenting is.", "[removed]", "Are you getting the short end of the stick, though?\n\nDid she have the short end of the stick the last few years?\n\nThis isn't just about money, but also your wife's career advancement.\n\nShe may be right that things will settle down. Commuting, for example, is tiring when you aren't used to it, and she may find it less stressful, or be able to time her drive better. \n\nCan she do slightly different hours? Start earlier or later to both help out at home in the morning or the evening & maybe miss the worst of rush hour?\n\nCan you afford to pay someone else to pick up the kids, or can you swap every other day with another parent to make things a bit easier on you?\n\nIt's hard to judge regarding household duties & childcare because you've only mentioned a few things.

YTA.", "... silly question what do you think she did all while working full time remote?", "YTA: by the sound of it, your wife was carrying a lot of the household chores solo. If she weren\u2019t this transition wouldn\u2019t be so stressful. Time to step up and do your part.", "I'm actually gonna go NAH.\n\nBased on OPs comments the benefits of wife's new job are $200/month more income and...a more prestigious title? Room for advancement in a few years I would hope, but who knows.\n\nThe drawbacks are: OPs wife is stressed by her job and her commute, less present with her family (eating dinner alone), OP is burning out having all of the household duties on him during the week, the kids miss spending time with their mom, and clearly because of this post it seems like their marriage is beginning to suffer.\n\nOP, your wife saw a chance to advance her career and thought the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks. If your description of the current situation is accurate, I would say not only your life, but also your wife and children's lives are worse than before and there is nowhere near the financial incentive of her increased income to make up for that. \n\nYour wife wasn't wrong for wanting to advance her career. You aren't wrong for noticing that it's made your entire family more tired, more stressed, and less connected for minimal financial benefit. But it sounds like your wife isn't ready to give up on this new job so you're just going to have to find a way to lessen your workload so you can have the energy to focus on finding ways to give your wife some quality time with the kids when she's able to.", "INFO\n\nWould you consider cutting down on hours? Or switching to a WFH job? Would that be acceptable for you?\n\nI think from what I\u2019ve read, your wife had the lions share of household chores before. Also picking up the kids in the afternoon either means she had to start very early in the morning or had to entertain/feed/support the kids during working hours after picking them up.\n\nDid you prepare dinners before or was it her? What household duties did you cover before, besides bringing the kids to school in the morning?", "I don\u2019t know if anyone is the a**hole here.\n\nFirst off, it sucks that her job has no remote options. Some jobs understandably require that, but others\u2026 are just old fashioned that way and need to get with the times. \n\nYou\u2019re justified in feeling the way you do, and expressing your displeasure with how the routine has changed (depending on how you expressed it). What you\u2019re experiencing is what a lot of mothers experience in two-income households. So you\u2019re getting a window into what a lot of women (unfortunately) experience. \n\nThere has to be a solution somewhere. I personally don\u2019t know what that would look like. For now I\u2019d suggest wrapping your head around the new reality and try your best not to blame your wife for the current circumstances (you don\u2019t want to build resentment). More than likely, the pay increase coupled with the career path enhancement have your wife ignoring all the strains her new job is putting on you *and* herself. And if that\u2019s the case, the solution may just be to ride it out until she gets tired or a better option comes along. Cause unfortunately a lot of companies are still trying to be brick-and-mortar in a time where that\u2019s just untenable. But I wish you and your family the best of luck! I believe you guys will figure it out.", "ESH. You both need to have a discussion. Ask her about the new job. Is it making her happy and fulfilled. Get some details about that. Did she feel used working from home? Did she feel you weren\u2019t pulling your weight because you had her to do things at home? We\u2019re you pulling your weight around the house?  Did she feel stifled because she was as at home all day every day and didn\u2019t get time to herself?  Why did she choose to go back to work?  She also needs to listen to the kids and ask them how they feel and what can she do to be more present in the less time she has with them. I am a working mom who commutes 45 miles and got home late and regret all of that. I did try to spend my evenings with them, but I was often tired and cranky. Maybe you guys hire a housekeeper to come in a couple times a month so the weekends don\u2019t become just pits of chores so she can chill with the kids.", "NTA- People who do not commute any distance have no idea how much a long commute, especially one that involves traffic, takes out of you.\n\nYou have to be constantly vigilant about what you are doing in a way you aren\u2019t while doing your actual job, and it is very tiring mentally and physically. \n\nI don\u2019t think the situation is going to change much either, but it is only 10 weeks so you can probably give it a little more time. However, when you do discuss it with her again, you should be focusing on the kids more than how hard it is for you.\n\nIt is not healthy for them that they don\u2019t even see her in the morning and she is too tired for much interaction with them in the evening. She will end up regretting this in the long term, because in the end it\u2019s just a job and she will never get this time back with her kids.", "INFO. Do you have a full-time job?

Where she could do household chores while on the clock.  She could start dinner earlier.  She could be present for the childcare.  At this time, most of the household was on her, and she made it work.  Yea you may have helped out, but most of it was on her, and as far as we're aware she didn't complain.\n\nNow most of it is on you, and you're complaining.  \n\nTo be fair, it sounds like she's ignoring her responsibilities as a mom and wife in favor of her job.  To be fair to her, many men do this too and their wives are left to deal with it.  \n\nYou are right, 10 weeks is enough time to adjust to something new.  Your thoughts and feelings are valid, as are your children's.  She does need to understand and listen to what you're saying.  It doesn't sound like she is.  It sounds like she was really excited about this opportunity and that excitement may have blinded her to the realities of what you're dealing with.\n\nI'll suggest two things.  The first is marriage counseling.  Not because something is necessarily wrong with your marriage, but you two are at an impasse where no one is being listened to.  A counselor may help both of you communicate your needs and wants in a more constructive and clear way, as well as help the two of you come to a compromise before any lasting resentment or anger can take hold.\n\nThe other, is that perhaps you two should look at moving.  Find somewhere that is in between your two jobs.  That way both your commutes are easier or faster.  She may be less stressed if her commute wasn't so far.  An hour and some change twice a day is a lot, especially if it's in a high traffic area.  \n\nI'm going to go with NTA here.  But I don't necessarily think she's an asshole either.

During the pandemic, my wife's job allowed her to switch to 100% WFH.  They never required her to go back to the office because her productivity actually increased so there was no need.  It made things easier for us too.  I dropped the kids off at school/daycare in the morning and she picked them up in the afternoon.  She was able to keep up with a few things around the house during the day, we saved on gas and car maintenance, etc.  \n\nA few months ago, she was contacted by a recruiter about a job.  It would be a nice step up in her career path as well as a boost in pay.  But there were drawbacks.  The company had no WFH policy and would require her to work in the office.  This was apparently non-negotiable.  It would also be a 45-minute commute for her.  \n\nWe talked it over a lot and I expressed my concerns about how this would impact our daily lives.  I told her that I don't necessarily think that the bump in pay is worth the major changes to our daily lives.  Not to mention the stress that a long commute can have on people and that could impact their mood and how they interact at home.  \n\nShe assured me that everything would be fine and that we would adjust as a family and soon the new routine would just become our new normal.  I told her that I would never tell her NOT to take the job, but I just don't know if it is worth the changes that it is going to bring.  Ultimately, the decision was hers and she accepted the new job.  She's been there for about 10 weeks now.  \n\nTo say it has been an adjustment is an understatement.  She wakes up and leaves before the kids even get up.  She'll help get a few things ready for them before she goes, but the entire morning kid routine is on me.  I also do both drop-off and pick-up for all the kids too.  Evenings have been a huge mess because I get home and try to get the kids distracted while I start dinner.  When my wife gets home, she is usually stressed from the drive (her commute has turned into over an hour due to construction and traffic) and takes 15 minutes for herself to calm down before eating alone.  Then, after dinner she's going to bed earlier because she has to wake up earlier.  \n\nAll in all, I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick and that all the changes her new job brought have been directly effecting me more than her and I'm getting burnt out already.  I brought this up to her to try and find ways that we can make changes because what we're currently doing isn't working.   \n\nI told her that I feel her new job has put an unfair amount of household and childcare duties on me and that she is being far less present in our lives when she's home.  She told me that we just need to give it more time to adjust and things will get easier.  I told her that 10-weeks is a pretty good adjustment period and I hate it so far.  She told me I'm being an unsupportive jerk and I need to give it more time.  \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You both need to find a way to create a new routine that compromises and set that in.\n\nIf chores in the week arent being done. Put up a family schedule for what jobs need doing on which days and who will do them. Make sure they are actually achievable and fair. Then other things can be done on sundays or something.\n\nIf the morning routine is too much alone, then look at doing things such as you both do bathtimes the night before, she lays the kids clothes out and you both take turns pre-making the kids lunches and breakfasts the night before. It doesnt take longer than 15 minutes to make a lunch and breakkie for the next day. Things like overnight oats, or whatever can be pre-prepped and just put down on a table for the kids to scoff. Obviously other breakfasts like toast takes 2 mins in the morning to do.\n\nMeal preps are a great idea and can easily be done if you make a big meal on Sunday or whatever snd just make multiples. Alternatively make large portions of dinner in the week so the leftovers can be used for dinner either the next day or day after.\n\nHave an agreed time for her to settle in when she gets in from work but the she needs to put work down and spend some time playing with the kids. Bathtime and bedtime can be part of that. It also means you get a break too to have some time to yourself. \n\nDo you both go to bed at the same time? If not is it not feasible to have a few nights a week where you do so you can both get some pillow talk time in? Other days if you wanna stay up then do so. But use those nights as your time nights so she gets a little more her time during the evening. Remember she is working her ass off too. Both of you are. \n\nUse Saturdays for fun. Go out with the kids. Have family time.

If she loves the new job, coming home to a partner who is going on about his feelings might make her feel unsupported. If the old job was unsustainable or toxic or just a bad fit, you bringing up dinner might make it seem you cared more about her motherly tasks than her as a person.

He was constantly stressed about earning some stability from his new employee, working extra hours to ensure he knew everything they\u2019d expect him to know\u2026 and that was with a mostly-telework position.

Do you think your wife is thrilled to have less time with her family? Do you think she doesn\u2019t miss that time with her kids? You\u2019re interpreting her choosing the job to mean this is her preferred dynamic, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019d far prefer to have the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen your wife took the job, she didn\u2019t think it would mean no change; she meant that the family would adjust to the changes. She wasn\u2019t saying she didn\u2019t care about the sacrifices; she was saying that the long-term benefits to her career would be worth the short-term sacrifice. The pay boost and promotion today will allow her to get future jobs with even higher pay, and more flexibility; there\u2019s a good chance someday you\u2019ll need that, when your own work position changes. Practically speaking, while you have the flexibility to do both pickup and drop-off of the kids is a good time to deal with these changes, so that if someday you aren\u2019t able to do either, she may have the career stability to take on both.\n\nStop comparing life today to what it was before she took this job; that was unusual, and the likelihood that it would have lasted indefinitely isn\u2019t high. Focus on what specifically would be helpful; instead of telling her \u201cyou\u2019re neglecting your family,\u201d ask her to help you brainstorm ways she can be more involved in family life. If she says this is still the adjustment period, tell her part of adjusting is actively troubleshooting the things that aren\u2019t working. \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to address the problems, but you do need to stop pretending that she wanted ALL of this, not just the long-term career potential that this current sacrifice will bring.

How about things like slow cooker/instant pot meals? Can we shift the work hours so that mom can be home for one or two suppers a week?
