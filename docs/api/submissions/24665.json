I loved him then and I still do now.\n\nThe reason why it was so back and forth is because he had some substance issues that he struggled to keep under control. When I found out I was pregnant with our daughter Hope (4f), I knew I didn\u2019t want her to grow up seeing her dad like that, so I ended things with James and hoped that she would be the wake-up call he needed to call it quits once and for all.\n\nFor a while, she was.

Grief isn\u2019t linear so I\u2019m not expecting everything to be great but she\u2019s handling it better than I thought she would, which is why it was out of the norm for her to be so distraught when I asked if she wanted to go take flowers to her daddy.\n\nShe threw a fit that took longer than normal to calm her down from. Eventually she told me that she didn\u2019t want to take flowers to him because she didn\u2019t like that he chose to leave her.\nShe\u2019s never said anything like that before, and I\u2019ve reiterated to her since he passed that her daddy loved her more than anything and I know he\u2019d be here with her if he could. \nHope then asked why her grandma would say he chose to stay sick & leave if he actually loved her that much.\n\nI sent Hope to her room as soon as my mom got home & I asked her to explain. She admitted that she told Hope that James chose to stay sick instead of getting help because he loved being \u201cout of it\u201d more than he loved *her*.\n\nI lost it. I asked her why she\u2019d ever say something like that to a little girl who just lost her dad, then I told her to get the hell out of my house.\n\nShe did leave, but she texted me saying Hope is going to grow up one day & realize why her dad isn\u2019t around, & she\u2019ll hate me for sugar coating it. Then she said that she was only trying to save us both from that situation.\n\nI have been an emotional wreck for the past month, which is why I can\u2019t tell if I overreacted here or not so I just want people uninvolved with the situation to render their judgment.", "created_utc": 1692050565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r8ms1/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_get_the_hell_out_of_my/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is a crappy thing for a person to say to a 4 year ikd, especially one that just lost their father. When she gets older, of course you can have an age-appropriate discussion about addiction and what happens, but that time isn't now and your mother was way out of line for what she did.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, NTA, you\u2019re grieving, Hope is grieving. You both need time to heal. The fact that Hope is 4 years old, trying to handle a loss that she really can\u2019t grasp right now at this age, and your mom voiced some rather venomous emotions to a baby, she actually lucky if you let her back into your and Hopes life. If you have access to a library, ask the counselor for some book recommendations on death for small children. One of my favorites is Fletcher and the Falling Leaves. It\u2019s about the change of seasons, and helps them understand that death isn\u2019t the end. Memories last forever. \nPeace.", "NTA at all.  What your mother said to your daughter may well be unforgivable.", "NTA - your mom is psychotic.  Deliberately traumatizing your daughter.  You and your daughter need to go a permanent NC with your Mom.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all: I am really sorry for your loss. \n\nWhat your mother said to your daughter is horrible. She is way to young to understand about addiction and mental health issues. And there is way more to it than him not \u201eloving her enough\u201c. Saying something like that can cause so much additional trauma to this little girl. \nThere will (and should) be a time for having a talk with her what happened with her dad when she is old enough.", "NTA. Your daughter is 4yo. What your mother did was awful and mean, expressing her anger at James in a way to hurt your daughter. You did not overreact to kick her out.", "NTA.  It doesn't matter what her intentions were--your mother is a threat to your child's mental health and possibly to yours too with that attitude.\n\nNobody has to pretend he was a saint--and yes, someday your child will have to come to terms with her father's addiction--and maybe she will even feel like he chose his addiction over her (though addiction is nowhere near that simple.)  But she is way too young to even understand addiction now, let alone deal with the blow to her self-esteem her grandma just dealt her.  And that's before considering the anger and resentment grandma seems to want to project onto her.", "NTA. Your daughter is too young to even understand the pain of addictions and your mother is completely out of place for telling her that information that will only cause her distress. Keep up mama, one day you can explain everything to your daughter and one day your mother is going to realize how wrong she was for doing this.", "NTA. What your mother said would be inappropriate to say to an adult grieving the death of a loved one. And it\u2019s obvious that your mother has *no* clue about the realities of addiction. \n\nIn any case, no matter what happened, she should *never* had said that to a child grieving a parent. She was not trying to save you from a future situation - she did something hateful and was offering a half-assed excuse for it.", "NTA- why would someone say that to a 4 year old", "NTA.  What she managed to do is ensure your daughter had her first experience with rejection.  \"You're daddy didn't love you enough...\"  that right there is a statement indicating rejection.  That is beyond not ok, especially to a 4 year old.  Be prepared for your daughter to become very clingy very fast out of fear that you don't love her enough either.  Also make sure to let her therapist know what your mom said to your daughter.  The therapist will know how to help get paat this, and reassure her that her dad did love her, but he was unwell in an age appropriate way.", "NTA. At all. \n\nYou are not sugar coating Hope\u2019s dad\u2019s death. You are doing your very best to explain what\u2019s happened in terms Hope understands. \n\nPlease speak with Hope\u2019s therapist and let them know what\u2019s happened. And please keep your mom away from Hope for a bit.", "NTA. That is absolutely not something you say to someone grieving the death of their parent, especially a child who probably still struggles with the concept of death.", "NTA.  Your mom is unhinged and needs therapy.  Hope isn't her daughter, she's yours, and YOU get to choose how to explain things to her about her father.  Prayers to you both, hope you both find some peace.", "Absolutely NTA at all. Your mom sure is an AH though. I would have went no contact with her until she understands what she did wrong.", "Your mom obviously has some long-standing resentments towards your daughter's father, and she's choosing to badmouth a dead man to a grieving child.  Your mother would be dead to me. She doesn't deserve to be in your daughter's life because she's choosing to hurt your daughter to get back at someone else.", "NTA in this instance, that was way overboard by mom even if she had good intentions. You were right in giving yourself some distance from the situation. While mom may in fact be correct, which you probably already know, she should have never conveyed that to a 4 year old.", "NTA. And tell your idiotic mother that even if she WERE right (she's so, so not) there's a SHIT TON of things that your child will \"grow up and learn one day\" that she doesn't need to know at 4 fucking years old. What you tell a grieving 14 year old, or 24 year old, etc is NOT THE SAME THING you would tell a grieving 4 year old. And again, she was wrong in what she said. I'm just pointing out the holes in her logic.", "NTA at all, and what your mother said to your daughter was absolutely wrong. I didn't immediately post a response as I had to walk the dog, and while doing so, i was trying to figure out why she would have said something so nasty. Then it hit me, your mom has been staying with both of you to help out, and in turn, she sees both of your pain and is extremely angry that he chose the drugs over her daughter and granddaughter. What she said was very wrong, but it may certainly help if she sees a therapist herself. She can't help you both as you grieve if she is carrying that kind of anger towards him.", ">she\u2019ll hate me for sugar coating it\n\nShe's FOUR!? WTF?! There's sugar coating and then there's age appropriateness, not that it is ever appropriate to tell a child that their newly deceased parent didn't love them. Your poor baby doesn't need to hear shit like that! I would have had trouble not *literally* throwing your mother out to be honest, I'm not one for violence but that would trigger the mama bear in me pretty darn quick. NTA.

And I\u2019m so sorry that your mom thought it was her role to hurt your daughter in such a terrible way. \n\nI have an extremely similar situation in my family. When my nephew died, we told his daughter exactly what caused his death (his heart stopped). She is in high school now and knows the entire story. She know that there may be a genetic component to addiction, and she should carefully avoid such substances\u2026and people who use them.  We all agreed to protect her from the reality of her dad\u2019s life and death until she asked. And we agreed on how to handle it WHEN she asked. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what we\u2019d have done to someone who behaved as your mother did.  I\u2019m so, so sorry!", "NTA at all. You don't give a four year old all the details about her father's death. Your mom went way too far. Yes, one day conversations will have to happen with Hope about her father's substance abuse issues. I waited until my son was about 12 to start into those some. \n\nHis father has mental health issues and unfortunately began to self-medicate. I will still never tell him (24 now) that his father chose the drugs and alcohol over him. Never. It disgusts me that your own mother said that to her 4 yo granddaughter. My heart breaks for Hope hearing that. \n\nThings I wish I would have known when I was grieving. It is okay to grieve in front of your daughter. It might help her to know you still love him. Talk about the happy times. It is hard at first. But, you try. It will mean tears, but sometimes also some laughs at the goofy ones.  Realize that sometimes she will want time by herself too. I know it is easy to want to check on her all the time. \n\nHer therapist needs to know about what your mom said to her. Your mom doesn't need to be around her. \n\nThere was nothing more you could have done for Hope's father. You'll run yourself ragged with the what ifs. I've been there. I know it's hard not to wonder. Just as long as you know that there wasn't more you could do. It was up to him to break free of his addiction. \n\nI want you to know that there might be times she tries to push you away. It is very common with kids who lose a parent early. Try not to take it personally. It's hard, but you have to try. Make sure you tell her every day that you love her. Make sure she gets a huge hug with it, unless she is in one of those pushing away moments. \n\nYou are doing the right things by her. I'm very sorry you both lost him. My heart is with you and Hope", "OMG. \nShe needs to get the hell out and stay the hell out. \n\nDon't ever leave your daughter alone with her again.

Your mom is evil.", "Oh my god NTA. Someday Hope may feel abandoned by her father, someday you may need to talk about addiction and what it does to a person, someday you may even need to talk about how a part of her father chose drugs over her or how he wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight his addictions no matter how much he loved her and that might feel like he chose them over her. That day is not today. That conversation is not for a 4 year who so recently lost her daddy.

She's experienced more grief than a child should ever have to. I don't want healing to be any harder for her than it already has been.", "I am assuming you're going to be giving your mom some kind of consequences for this, and when you do I think it might be a good idea to explain that to Hope, because it might help her understand that Grandma was being awful and what she said was wrong. \n\nIf she sees that Grandma's getting a HUGE time out, I'm guessing that will reinforce everything else I know you're doing to reassure her that her daddy absolutely loved her  \n\nFWIW, just from the brief post you've written, it's clear to me that he did love her immensely, and that he may be gone *but he did not leave her.* If I can see that from here, there's not a single fucking excuse for your mom not understanding that.", "I wish you both nothing but the best.", "The hell is wrong with her ?

I would NEVER have said anything like this to a young child left behind.\n\nNo way did your mom do this for Hope's benefit. She did it because she wanted to feel like a moral authority, to condemn someone that she held in contempt, and she was willing to distress a small grieving child to do so. \n\nNTA, and your mom needs to go on time out until she can show some genuine remorse.", "Nta, it sounds like you're handling things perfectly fine with your daughter.

He dealt with a lot of trauma throughout his life and struggled with staying clean for most of his marriage to my sister. He loved my niece more than life itself. Despite the substance abuse, I was jealous of how present he was as a dad to her because I grew up with an abusive father myself. Last year, he lost that fight. My niece, who is one of the most resilient people I know, has her good and bad days. Most of the time she's ok, sometimes she has nights where she will just play over and over again the sound bite of her dad singing a silly song to her during bathtime in the build a bear we got her after he died. One day she's telling me to give the ash necklace of her dad \"Dusty\" a high five (thats not his name but she nicknamed the necklace that because ashes = dust) or singing \"i can buy my mom flowers cuz my dad is dead\" to the tune of Miley Cyrus's song Flowers, and other days she's sobbing because she missed him. It's difficult enough as it is for young children to healthily process the death of a parent while their living parent is also grieving, and to have someone undermine that process can cause both of your grieving processes some severe damage. \n\nFirst of all, your mother doesn't know father's daughter well enough to make the judgment that he loved his daughter less because he chose not to get better. There's no one who can make that judgment. He made a series of bad choices but she doesn't know what he was fighting through. But even if he was selfish and even if all those other things are true, it was not her place to say it, much less say it to a CHILD who isn't even hers. \n\nSecond of all, you made the right call kicking her out. I can't tell you what you should or shouldn't do in the future but in my opinion, this would be enough for me to go low contact with a parent. If she defends her actions, there's no telling when she will choose to undermine your parenting again and choose to damage your child further.", "Saying that to your duaghter was not the right thing to do, but your mom was not wrong to feel that way. \n\nYes, addiciton is real and beating it is hard, but those left behind by people who lose that battle have a right to feel angry. \n\nBut regardless of that right, your mom should not have done what she did.
