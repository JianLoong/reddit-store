One day you'd end up cooking a portion of your meals for him too, and you wouldn't know how you got there.\n\nThe kid is 7. Definitely old enough to know not to steal. Clearly the dad's behaviour is not helping the child learn not to, since he offloads the blame onto anyone except himself or the kid. When I was 7, I would ask my mom if I was allowed to have a candy from the cupboard (she never said no, but I felt like I should ask because, well, I wanted to make sure it was ok).\n\nI think a firm boundary should be set here, because new roommate is taking advantage of your kindness. \"This is my food. If you or your child eat my food, you are stealing, and you will have to reimburse me for the costs. I am not liable for any health implications caused by said food.\" Roommate is trying to guilt trip and manipulate you into feeding him and his child.", "My kid has severe allergies, by the age of 2 my child was consistently able to tell other adults: 1. They had allergies. 2. What foods they were allergic to. 3. That they could not eat anything not checked my a parent. We had strict rules about my child not helping themselves to any food ANYWHERE, including our own house. My kid never put anything in their mouth without asking first, even at home. They followed this strict rule because they understood the direct connection that eating those things made them sick. We never had to make any punishment, bribe or threat to get our kid to comply because we invested so much time coaching them as they grew up on how to stay safe. It took constant effort in the early years. Our house was allergen free, but still we had the rule of not eating anything without asking because sometimes others (family, friends, neighbors, other kids, etc) would accidentally bring an item into the house and leave it that wasn\u2019t safe. Our routine was to check the label, every time, even in our own house. More than a few times that saved our kid from ingesting things they were severely allergic to. It sounds like there are no controls in place for the safety of the kid and that is the parent\u2019s responsibility, not yours. NTA at all. The parent sounds incredibly lazy.

But also leaving out penutbutter brownies when a 7 year old with nut allergies lives in the house is kinda fucked in my opinion. \n\nI get how his actions would make you lose sympathy, but I do kinda agree with him on the brownies.", "NTA, but how old is this kid? If he\u2019s a preschooler, then yeah, watch what you leave within his reach, or at least warn the dad if you have something out that the kid could get into. A way of kid proofing the fridge would be good, too. If he\u2019s little, he\u2019s going to get into things, and while dad should be watching him, it\u2019s not realistic to expect him to have eyes on this kid 24/7. It\u2019s not your responsibility, but you don\u2019t want a 4 year old going to the hospital because you left almond cookies on the table.\n\nIf the kid is more like 10, he\u2019s old enough to understand that he has no business eating other people\u2019s food. He\u2019s also old enough to ask about allergens in foods that he wants to eat, if he doesn\u2019t already know they\u2019re safe. If this is an older kid, you can tell the dad to keep his son out of your stuff. They should just assume any food that dad didn\u2019t buy is full of nuts, and kindly stop stealing from you.", "NTA but you probably need a lawyer before this escalates. \n\nI can't imagine a 7year old kid not understanding his own allergies, unless he is being neglected. He's not being fed so eats whatever is available. Did the dad mention any Epi pens or medical emergency contacts for the kid?", "NTA\u2026 if you are highly allergic to something why would you chance eating someone else food!!??", "NTA but also....how old is the kid and does he have him full time?\n\nIf it is a toddler, leave your backing a little higher to cool....other than that fuck this entitled prick! If he can't provide for his own kids maybe he shouldn't ha e him", "Nta", "NTA. Don't steal food. Simples!", "Okay, well, good luck with the 7 year old roomate then! I'm sure it'll all work out without any of you making any changes. After all, it's your house, why should you have to figure out a solution to make the living situation work for everyone? \ud83d\ude43", "I just don't think it's okay to play around with killing a kid just because he tries to steal a cookie or brownie.  His dad stopped him and is actively trying to teach his kid to not take food/be safe, but.... The kid is *seven*.\n\nLike... Damn.  Does no one here remember ever breaking a rule or screwing up when they were a 7 year old?  I can guarantee that everyone age 8 and older did.", "Reused containers of ice cream, fruit jam, etc. fills our kitchen sink for the people to take food samples. LOL", "NTA. You need to stop this guy from asking for groceries again. He's doing it so he doesn't have to buy everything he needs and uses yours instead. I do not mind helping people, but I've dealt with people that would penny pinch their own resources while being liberal with others. It's like a person that would always be joining the group buy at clubs but never offer up or never be there when it was their turn to offer the round. It's about time for a house meeting to reinforce the \"STOP USING/EATING OTHER PEOPLE'S FOOD\".", "nta", "The dad\u2019s being entitled and absolutely should not be blaming you for his kid eating your food - however if he can\u2019t control his kid, you might want to label things with nuts or put them away somewhere the kid can\u2019t reach. \nIt\u2019s not your responsibility for sure and you don\u2019t have to but generally I\u2019d prefer to be safe than have a dead kid on my conscience.", "NTA.  Your roommate needs to teach his kid not to touch other people\u2019s food, especially with his allergies.  It\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure his kid doesn\u2019t eat anything he shouldn\u2019t eat.  That\u2019s a parent\u2019s job.  It\u2019s also in no way your responsibility to buy milk his kid can also drink.  You are not his coparent.", "NTA.  Your roommate is not taking care of his kid.  It's his obligation to make sure there's food for his child, and to keep his child out of other people's food.", "NTA. Stop stealing my food and your allergies will stop as well.", "Absolutely no more lending or borrowing.", "Exactly. My niece has lots of food allergies. At 3 years old she could reel off the whole list for you, and any time she accepted food from anyone but her parents, she asked first if it had any (long list of forbidden foods) in it. She understood it was her and her parents who were responsible for checking what she ingests. If you'd waved a cookie in front of her, her eyes would light up, but she'd go find daddy or mommy to clear it for her. It sucks for a kid to have to take so much responsibility so early, but if it's a life and death situation then it's up to a parent to make sure they either have the kid in a sterile bubble or else have prepared them for handling their issues. This kid is old enough to understand a simple rule like you never touch food that dad hasn't given him. Dad is old enough to understand a simple rule like never touch food that you haven't personally purchased or grown. He's failing as a parent of a kid with special needs, and wants to palm off part of his responsibility to everyone else in the house. None of whom signed up for surrogate parenting duty.", "I would never try to put them on top of my fridge. Fridge is built-in, high up to the ceiling. Brownies might fit there, but I would have to get myself a chair or stepladder to put them there, and to take them back down, and I sure as hell am not going to do that with brownies fresh from the oven!! \n\nAgreement is that food is not shared. That means food I made is safe from being eaten by anyone else in the apartment.", "Nah. It\u2019s to prevent a person from refusing to accept no after repeatedly asking for everyone\u2019s food.\n\nMaking each person responsible for their own food with no exceptions prevents mooching.\n\nThere\u2019s no rule that food items can\u2019t be shared, they just can\u2019t be asked for.", "I want so badly to be that sort of person. I literally will have borrowed Tupperware sitting on a counter for months because I still intend to return it... In addition to my own control issues, I also loathe unmatched sets, which extends to Tupperware as well. The trouble is that I also have a terrible memory, so I rarely follow through despite my best intentions.", "YTA and kinda need ya head caved in, ya rat dog", "He chose to live there with his son so he is responsible for the environment.  I say not your kid not your responsibility.  He\u2019s the parent and should teach kid not to touch other stuff or set boundaries.  And if you are buddies just housemates I\u2019d stick to the plan and let him have sugar,milk,etc.   again he\u2019s the parent and should provide and it doesn\u2019t blur the lines.  You should be able to live your life.", "Lol poor kid.. and his dumb father", "Of course NTA. Have a good conversation about the house rules, which include not eating each others food. That solves the allergy problem in one go. His kid, his problem.", "The father is the AH for many reasons. \n\nMy 5YO was diagnosed with egg-allergy. Within 2 weeks, he knew to ask a grown up if whatever he is presented with contains eggs. \n\nThe father is TA and the kid is a thief enabled by his AH father.", "NTA - well just a bit.\n\n1. How well-off is the guy financially?\n2. Is he having trouble raising the kid?\n3. How old is the kid?\n\nNone of this is supposed to justify the roommate's actions. He should teach his own kid about not eating other people's food. And definitely not be asking you for food supplies knowing his kid is allergic.\n\nHaving said that, you are kind of an asshole for leaving the food out unattended. The kid is not supposed to eat that, but, it's a kid.....and believe me, you don't wanna be responsible for a kid dying. That's the last thing anyone wants on their conscience. Just keep the food separate out of the reach of the kid, and tell your roommate to teach his kid to not open the fridge...unless he wants to die.", "NTA Your only mistake is breaking your no-sharing rule with him in the first place. This is the sort of crap people start trying to pull once you give sharing the ok. Tell roommate that there will be no more sharing. Judging from his milk complaints, he only started asking to share so he can get free food at your expense and now he's trying to make you buy food that only accommodate his son's diet. Put your foot down and say no!

Fine if it's close to the day I'm heading to the shops. The worst feeling in the world if it's 8pm and you've been looking forward to cooking something with that ingredient all day.", "I love it!", "That\u2019s fair, I will say they did still ask first and we were all students at the time so I only really needed enough for one portion and almost everything I bought had enough for multiple.", "All hail Amanda, our Lady Returns Your Tupperware", "My roommate is like that. She's a treasure."]}
