Tell your room mate that since his son is so allergic that he should not eat other peoples food.  He needs to buy enough food for his kid so that they don't feel the need to ask for other people's stuff.\n\nPut a note on all of your food that it has nuts in it, regardless of if it has nuts or not.

He needs to be watching his kid better. It's not your job to allergy proof your own food (which the kid shouldn't be getting into anyway). I hate to say it, but I'd consider getting a fridge lockbox anyway because if his kids gets into your stuff he's going to suffer due to dad being a slacker. I'd also be looking into getting them out as soon as the lease is up.", "NTA\n\nIf dad and kid are going to be living in shared accommodations, the onus is on them to learn to manage this. The seven year old is going to school and hanging out with friends and therefore needs to be able to understand that he has to stay away from any food unless he knows all the ingredients are safe for him. \n\nI do understand that pretty much everyone prefers to have their own place if they can. This family may not be used to shared accommodations. It might be harder for a parent to get out for (or even afford) more groceries. That said, it's a slippery slope with food borrowing boundaries and expectation of accommodation of the boy's needs.
