Like, if someone used a cup that had been washed thoroughly three times since it last had peanut butter in it and had to use an epi-pen, I'd certainly be asking roommates to make accomodations.\n\nBut, that would also need to be disclosed before agreeing to room together.\n\n(I will say, this is not the sort of arrangement *I'm* used to, but then, I'm also not used to rooming with strangers.  Lived in a house with myself and four roommates at one point, but we were all buddies *before* we moved in together, and we'd share stuff and have communal meals.  But then, my roommate days were all back in years that started with a \"1\".)\n\nEDIT: Forgot verdict.  Gonna go with NTA given the info here.", "I like this idea. And put a note on the fridge saying the same thing.", "Also that roommates are expected to be organized and decent enough to buy their own food, instead of constantly \"borrowing\" from others - even if they ask politely.", "Exactly! An additional thing you can do is to have a private discussion with the parent because they don\u2019t seem to understand that it\u2019s not communal food. You guys don\u2019t really borrow from each other or share each other\u2019s food.", "That\u2019s a good point to add. A few requests would be tolerated, but if I got many requests for eggs or milk I\u2019d get tired of that housemate quickly.", "NTA - I would just let the new roommate know that all your food will have nuts in it or will have come into contact with nuts so his child shouldn\u2019t risk eating any of your food. It\u2019s his responsibility to teach his kid to avoid the things he is allergic to. I have a 7 year old, while they aren\u2019t always the best listeners they are definitely old enough to understand that there are things they can\u2019t eat because they will get sick. It\u2019s his dad\u2019s job to remind him of that.", "NTA.  He's the Dad, he needs to Parent and that includes making sure you have milk, eggs, and sugar available.

Seems he picked the wrong place to live or has high expectations for you.", "Nta. This kid\u2019s allergy is not your problem. Sounds like this dude and his child aren\u2019t suited to living with housemates.", "NTA. The dad needs to parent his own kid and teach him not to take other people's food. While he's at it, he also needs to learn to provide his own food for himself and his kid, and not be constantly wanting to \"borrow\" food from the roommates. If his kid likes to eat cereal in the mornings, dad needs to make sure there's milk for the cereal, not rely on his roommates to provide the milk, even if he has to make a run to the store in the evening to pick up milk.\n\nAs an aside, I can't get over the entitlement of him being annoyed that you buy only almond milk. You're buying it for *you*, not for him!\n\nA house meeting is in order, with the kid present, to review house rules and make sure everyone is aware of and agrees to abide by house rules.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sure it is difficult but the dad needs to keep his kid from eating any food but the stuff he makes or buys him. If he can\u2019t do that he should not live with roommates. If it was important that no one they lived with had allergens in the home he should have addressed that before moving in.", "This new roommate needs to be talked to about how the house worked BEFORE his arrival.\n\nNo one ever ate any one else's food.  No one ever took any one else groceries.  Food is not shred in the house.\n\nGranted the child is young at age 7, and maybe this is not the best setting for a 7 yr old.  Your had your house rules set before this person moved in with a kid.  Their kid is their responsibility; NOT the room mates.\n\nNTA", "NTA- It's not your responsibility to make sure a kid doesn't eat food that isn't theirs in the first place and the parent is actually doing this kid a major disservice. Kids with allergies especially severe ones MUST learn to ask if they can have something and if it contains something they're allergic to. It can literally be a matter of life or death. He clearly doesn't have an airborne allergy, so you having nuts in the house is fine. This is a parenting problem.", "NTA\nhave you tried telling the kid to stop stealing from you? perhaps he can be reasoned with evwn though his dad can't", "NTA, but I think this is going to be a consistent issue with this roommate and his kid.\n\nIt just doesn't sound like dad-roommate is keeping his cabinets sufficiently stocked for when his kid is over. The little guy seems to be scavenging for anything he can fill his belly with.\n\nDad-roommate both seems to want to live off your supplies, and blame you for not buying things his kid can eat. \n\nI don't think this is going to work out.", "Why would you live with a roommate that has a kid?", "ESH hear me out here. He needs to get ahold of his child so that the kid doesn\u2019t get seriously sick. But also I know from myself and my brother that allergies are a scary thing and cross contamination is very easy. For you have to have things he\u2019s extremely allergic to baking in the kitchen like the fudge you\u2019re putting him in serious harms way because everyone uses those utensils.", "There are two separate issues here roommate behavior and OPs behavior. NTA in general for making food you like/not wanting to share. And roommate is not respecting the house rules and is clearly TA. But the kid is 7 and has an issue crossing boundaries here. He has severe allergies. You can make an effort to keep things like brownies that contain ingredients he\u2019s allergic to out of his reach. Clear out an upper cupboard. I mean come on. Obviously a discussion about house rules is necessary. And an absolutely no food sharing rule. \n\n\nI have a hard time believing this story on general though. Allergy kids tend to be much better than non allergy kids about asking about food/ingredients before eating it. Even at young ages. You know, cause they really don\u2019t want to experience anaphylactic shock and all.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a power move.\n\nTell him to train his kid if he wants the kid to live.", "NTA.

On the other hand, you don't want to essentially lay traps for them.\n\nI'll expect a school-age kid not to open a sealed container in the fridge that isn't theirs, but I'm not sure I could reasonably expect them to avoid taking a cookie from a pile of 'em out in the open.", "And we do wash stuff. If we are making something he is allergic to we triple wash and replace the dishrag after", "I've talked to this kid maybe twice. We all stay in our own parts of the property and he is usually asleep when I get home from work or at his mother's place", "When I lived in a place like this, I was told when I moved in (and it was in the lease) that if I ran out of something, I just ran out and that was my problem.  We were explicitly forbidden to ask any of our neighbors/roommates for ANYTHING.

But to each their own", "I would suggest simply baking them without nuts. Even if he didn\u2019t eat everything you put out it would still be dangerous. You said yourself he\u2019s \u201cmajorly allergic\u201d cross contamination exists and for you to put something dangerous for him in space where him and his family is going to touch and use utensils is not safe. If you can\u2019t handle doing something as simple as cutting nuts out of your diet you need to move.", "They were fresh out of the oven cooling off on the counter.
