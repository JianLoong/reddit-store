Roommate will probably balk, but it underlines a point: this is not a \u201csharing\u201d situation, protect your kid and supply your own needs.\n\nLowkey sounds like roommate is looking for a shared living arrangement so that he gets (unpaid) help.

One day you'd end up cooking a portion of your meals for him too, and you wouldn't know how you got there.\n\nThe kid is 7. Definitely old enough to know not to steal. Clearly the dad's behaviour is not helping the child learn not to, since he offloads the blame onto anyone except himself or the kid. When I was 7, I would ask my mom if I was allowed to have a candy from the cupboard (she never said no, but I felt like I should ask because, well, I wanted to make sure it was ok).\n\nI think a firm boundary should be set here, because new roommate is taking advantage of your kindness. \"This is my food. If you or your child eat my food, you are stealing, and you will have to reimburse me for the costs. I am not liable for any health implications caused by said food.\" Roommate is trying to guilt trip and manipulate you into feeding him and his child.", "My kid has severe allergies, by the age of 2 my child was consistently able to tell other adults: 1. They had allergies. 2. What foods they were allergic to. 3. That they could not eat anything not checked my a parent. We had strict rules about my child not helping themselves to any food ANYWHERE, including our own house. My kid never put anything in their mouth without asking first, even at home. They followed this strict rule because they understood the direct connection that eating those things made them sick. We never had to make any punishment, bribe or threat to get our kid to comply because we invested so much time coaching them as they grew up on how to stay safe. It took constant effort in the early years. Our house was allergen free, but still we had the rule of not eating anything without asking because sometimes others (family, friends, neighbors, other kids, etc) would accidentally bring an item into the house and leave it that wasn\u2019t safe. Our routine was to check the label, every time, even in our own house. More than a few times that saved our kid from ingesting things they were severely allergic to. It sounds like there are no controls in place for the safety of the kid and that is the parent\u2019s responsibility, not yours. NTA at all. The parent sounds incredibly lazy. Now if you handed that kid something without checking with the parent, that would make you T  A because kids typically trust adults they live with to keep them safe, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you would ever do anything like that.", "YTA\n\nThis is a kid.

Since the age of 4 and they started staying with me alone.  7 with a food allergy is way past knowing better.", "Even that level of effort shouldn\u2019t be expected of you. I think you have gone above and beyond reasonable. It\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility to add in those layers of safety around their kid.", "The kid is 7. Kids his age see brownies and eat them. They need reminding not to.\n\nThe dad should teach his son to manage his allergies better but at the same time you agreed to live with a young child and therefore should have laid down some better ground rules and included the kid - you think the kid read your room mate agreement?", "You shouldn\u2019t have to in your own home, but a 7 year old can die if he makes a mistake. \n\nYes it\u2019s on dad to teach him to stop stealing. But is the risk really worth it? Could you cool them on top of the fridge?", "If the kid can't be trusted like that, the dad needs to watch him. That is the *only* solution. It is not on OP, who has been living here childfree for years, to make major behavior changes to suit someone else's *bad* behavior. Baked goods need to cool. People need to not steal. This is actually really simple.", "They ate the keft over wings, probably from original package.\nSeems to me Dad has a keen eye for findng food for him and his kid that he doesn't havecto pay for.", "Yeah growing up we were taught to ask permission to eat anything in the house or In anyone else\u2019s house that wasn\u2019t put on our plate at mealtime. It\u2019s a good way to keep kids safe.", "So I\u2019m right to assume 7 was old enough to know. I\u2019m a young adult with no kids, but nieces and nephews under 4 still. Oldest is 6 due to brothers gf son. And he even knows to ask. The 2 year old is reminded each time to ask for a treat.", "When I was 7, I asked before eating ANYTHING. I knew that my mom might have made the brownies for a specific event, so unless she told me beforehand that I could have a brownie, I'd hunt her down and **ask**. This is a parenting issue, not just \"kids will be kids\". It is on the roommate to teach his kid not to eat things without asking.", "Are you guys REALLY asking someone without kids, probably without any experience of kids, to be more foreseeable of possible problems than THE ACTISL DAD IS??\n\nI love how you all think everyone has to be engagedi in  every kid's activities except when a stramger tells a kid to not be rude or not to hit or bother animals or generally intervenes with bad behaviour.\nThem all of a sudden, magically you shouldn't have anything to do with others kids because they are not your responsibility \ud83e\udd23", "There are lots of things dangerous for children. Kids shouldn't run with knives, do we get rid of every knife? Kids could fall down stairs so do we get rid of stairs? It all comes down to the FATHER managing what the child has access to. If I want to eat peanut butter ice cream and keep some in the freezer that should not be an issue even if someone is allergic. My friend/roommate has a shellfish allergy. I keep shellfish in the fridge sometimes because that is what normal humans do.", "Dad probably IS teaching him... but kids are often disobedient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the kid hasn't had a scare in his recent memory, he doesn't get it as much. My kid started to get serious about checking when she had an epipen shot that she was old enough to remember the pain of.", "The kid is SEVEN! \n\nRight or wrong they won't always manage their own allergies and will do childish things like see brownie eat brownie. \n\nIf you don't want to alter a few things to accommodate living with a young child don't agree to rent the room to someone with one. Poor kid is already clearly growing up in a financially unstable position if his dad needs to rent a room with two other people the kid doesn't know, now you're expecting him to be more grown up than he is.\n\nHave a word with the dad about managing his kids health better and reiterate he needs to get all their own food, but don't blame the kid for literally being a kid.", "That's exactly the right way for young ones.  Your siblings are raising them correctly.  I was so proud of my kids when I started seeing just how well behaved my grandkids are.  One less thing to worry about.", "Right?  I\u2019d experience consequences if I ate food not put on my plate at meals without permission.  My sister\u2019s kids got time outs if the disobeyed rule around what food could be eaten.", "No, I don\u2019t even think he was wrong to leave the brownies out to cool the first time. But now that he knows the kid has impulse control issues with food (and probably doesn\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to understand his restrictions) how is it hard to ask him to consider where he puts nut filled treats? Or only to make peanut butter brownies during school hours?\n\nIs his right to do what ever he wants in the kitchen really worth a kid dying because we all know how great kids are at listening to their parents!! ERs are filled with kids with heath issues because they rebel against their parents and don\u2019t understand consequences.", "It is the father\u2019s responsibility. But let me ask you this- if the kid had managed to get a bite of that brownie and had died, would you still be so apathetic about it?\n\nIt is not your responsibility or your job to watch the kid 24/7. But if there is one little thing you could do to potentially save his life, why can\u2019t you do it? Is it really going to ruin your life to take a second to think about where you can cool your brownies?", ">I shouldn't have to hide things meant for me somewhere else.\n\nYou shouldn't have to, but is \"I was in the right\" worth a child dying?\n\nKnives are not a temptation to a child in the same way that brownies are. People take precautions like baby gates for stairs. Both stairs and knives are necessary, and brownies are not, and it's not like anyone was asking you to give up brownies, just to think about where they're put.", "Yup, kids don\u2019t understand the seriousness of something they haven\u2019t experienced. He probably just thinks it\u2019s unfair he can\u2019t have a brownie. \n\nDad 100% needs to teach his kid and keep an eye on him. But OP shouldn\u2019t be leaving death traps around just \u2018because he can\u2019", "The father should\u2019ve taught his kids manners not to take food at 7. A 7 year old can learn not to touch things and should\u2019ve at 5 honestly.", "We are all blaming the dad. For not supervising and not teaching his kid essential life skills he needs to have, to, you know, survive.", "Seven isn\u2019t that young FFS. By five my niece who had multiple allergies was able to follow rules around food. A child with a severe allergy needs strict rules and CONSEQUENCES to ensure safety, not a group of housemates tiptoeing around. In a house like this there will always be guests who will leave potential allergens around. My niece\u2019s doctor impressed upon my sister that sadly around food my niece would have to learn much younger than other children to follow rules for her own safety.", "The father needs to teach his child.  By the time my allergy child was 4 she 100% knew to not touch any food that wasn\u2019t given her to by me or that she didn\u2019t ask if it was safe.  He\u2019s doing his child a huge disservice by not teaching him about safe food eating.  This kid could steal another child\u2019s snack at school and die because he hasn\u2019t been taught that he can\u2019t eat everything and should always ask first unless it was given to him by a parent.", "The kid is not OP\u2019s problem! Plain and simple. He\u2019s old enough to understand he\u2019s got allergies and what they will do to him if eaten. Kid is the responsibility of the dad and dad only. He needs to do a better job! OP is NTA but the dad sure tf is!"]}
