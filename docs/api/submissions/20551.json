Roommate will probably balk, but it underlines a point: this is not a \u201csharing\u201d situation, protect your kid and supply your own needs.\n\nLowkey sounds like roommate is looking for a shared living arrangement so that he gets (unpaid) help.

One day you'd end up cooking a portion of your meals for him too, and you wouldn't know how you got there.\n\nThe kid is 7. Definitely old enough to know not to steal. Clearly the dad's behaviour is not helping the child learn not to, since he offloads the blame onto anyone except himself or the kid. When I was 7, I would ask my mom if I was allowed to have a candy from the cupboard (she never said no, but I felt like I should ask because, well, I wanted to make sure it was ok).\n\nI think a firm boundary should be set here, because new roommate is taking advantage of your kindness. \"This is my food. If you or your child eat my food, you are stealing, and you will have to reimburse me for the costs. I am not liable for any health implications caused by said food.\" Roommate is trying to guilt trip and manipulate you into feeding him and his child.", "My kid has severe allergies, by the age of 2 my child was consistently able to tell other adults: 1. They had allergies. 2. What foods they were allergic to. 3. That they could not eat anything not checked my a parent. We had strict rules about my child not helping themselves to any food ANYWHERE, including our own house. My kid never put anything in their mouth without asking first, even at home. They followed this strict rule because they understood the direct connection that eating those things made them sick. We never had to make any punishment, bribe or threat to get our kid to comply because we invested so much time coaching them as they grew up on how to stay safe. It took constant effort in the early years. Our house was allergen free, but still we had the rule of not eating anything without asking because sometimes others (family, friends, neighbors, other kids, etc) would accidentally bring an item into the house and leave it that wasn\u2019t safe. Our routine was to check the label, every time, even in our own house. More than a few times that saved our kid from ingesting things they were severely allergic to. It sounds like there are no controls in place for the safety of the kid and that is the parent\u2019s responsibility, not yours. NTA at all. The parent sounds incredibly lazy. Now if you handed that kid something without checking with the parent, that would make you T  A because kids typically trust adults they live with to keep them safe, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you would ever do anything like that.", "YTA\n\nThis is a kid.

The real issue here is the dad needs to have a talk w his son to keep his damn hands to himself.", "Tell him Instacart exists for a reason", "Some people have to ruin it for everyone. If resources were infinite, sure, mooch off me all you want. But they're not so it's a problem.", "I must have missed where he asked her to get regular milk.", "Children don't learn from being \"old enough to know\" something.\n\nA child must be taught in order to learn.  This dad doesn't teach, & he seems to think that someone else will take care of it..", "Right? Like I would ask if I could have *water* at my *grandma\u2019s* even younger than that.

Eventually just stopped trying to buy food or use the kitchen bc everything I made was gone. Even my honey turned into their honey.

Kid is definitely old enough to know better.\n\nI would recommend talking to your roommate about the severity of the nut allergy though. If it's a major allergy, the kid learning to not steal food may not be enough to keep him safe. I'm  a teacher and every few years I get a student with a nut allergy bad enough that someone eating a Reese's and not wiping the table well enough is dangerous. The parent really should've communicated these concerns before moving in and they're an asshole for not doing so.", "NTA\nBut the kid is still kinda young & still learning. Every kid kinda has mischievous phases. Maybe just make sure your brownies are out of reach? Tbh brownies are hard to resist even for me. Everything else is annoying tho.", "NTA. If the son is 7 years old he is old enough to know what he can and cannot eat. You are also not his parent so you have no responsibility to monitor what he eats.", "NTA\n\nThe parent needs to, I dunno, parent.

NTA, but kids are kids and don't always think before grabbing food. It's likely very hard on this parent to kerp their kid safe and it's probably exhausting to have to be on guard all the time.

But if it saves the kids' life it's worth it", "NTA, if it\u2019s not a matter of contaminating the shared space then it isn\u2019t your problem.

But other than that this is a problem that is easily solved by them not encroaching on their roommates and taking their food, which he almost sounds like he thinks he\u2019s entitled to.\n\nDad should be teaching the kid how to manage his allergies and stay alive, not make it everyone else\u2019s problem to ensure all food in the house is allergy free. How else is this kid going to grow up and live with allergies? These foods will be all around for the remainder of his life, he needs to learn to avoid them and to check on unknown foods before eating them impulsively", "NTA - the boy is 7, he should know that he\u2019s not supposed to steal other people\u2019s stuff. No matter what. And your roommate should better watch out and take the responsibility if something happens to his child.

If he can\u2019t afford that, vigilance is free.", "So, you're definitely not the asshole here, and this guy has some nerve coming into a new living space with an established household and demand that he not only disrupts the norm, but expects you to supply him and his son with groceries that they prefer. Absolutely not cool.    \nTHAT BEING SAID, I think it would be a good compromise if you agreed to not \"leave food out\" that he could get a hold of. It's absolutely an inconvenience, I get that, but that's why I wouldn't live with a roomate who has a child. A 7 year old isn't responsible enough to choose foods for themselves because of an allergy. They're just not going to get it, and it's not your place to teach them if they don't know.     \nWhat about creating a new practice of labeling your food, or each getting a shelf in the pantry/fridge/etc. It would be best if his father could just buy a few packs of stickers, for example, and teach the kid that he can only eat foods with a green circle - which are his fathers foods - and that red circle foods are NOT his and could make him sick. You can use red circles (or whatever marker you choose) on all of your foods so it's clear to the child what's not theirs. Personally if I was the father, I would take on the chore of labeling packages myself as to not inconvenience my roomates, but Im not him so maybe this will fall on the others two, but I think asking him to at least label his own foods and teach his child an easier way to differentiate would be the best way to go about this - with the least amount of conflict.", "NTA.  Put a small fridge with a lock on it in your room. The father can't be trusted to monitor his own kid and the kid sounds too young to know he shouldn't steal food from other people.", "What?? No, NTA. He is responsible for feeding his kid - you are not expected to know what in everything. If he wasn\u2019t such a mooch it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "NTA. My daughter is lactose intolerant. When she was diagnosed at 4 years old, we talked to her about being careful. We told her to always ask if she isn't sure if she can have something to avoid getting sick. Now she's 10 and she checks for herself when attending parties without us and she has for years.\n\nBut beyond allergies, there is a boundaries issue. You should be able to store food in the fridge and not worry that it will be eaten. The dad needs to understand that he's renting a room, he didn't gain co-parents or friends to help feed and care for his child. It's not that kind of house.\n\nYou may want to invest in a mini fridge if it becomes an issue, though that won't help with dry stuff.", "NTA. This is just a bad idea. The dad and his don't seem to understand the environment they moved into and their behavior isn't well suited to not causing problems. He shouldn't be asking you for milk much less acting like you should stocking milk you don't drink in case his kid might need it. \n\nThere needs to be an adult sit down, where you all explain that food is not communal and you expect him to keep his child away from your food. Make it clear you aren't responsible for the child and he needs to watch him. \n\nBeyond the triple washing dishes and changing the wash rag, it is ridiculous that you can't even make brownies without having to watch them because of a kid.

NOT your problem and you're NTAH.", "NTA. How old is the kid?", "Not your problem at all. Tell this guy to stop touching food that isn't his.

Especially if this kid is so severely allergic to many different foods, he needs to learn impulse control and how to navigate their life without getting anything they want. The parent may not be around in every situation and the kid needs to learn to be responsible with his health.
