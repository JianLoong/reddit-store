The chances of them buying the home outright and not using a mortgage lender and title company is astronomically low, and either of them absolutely would tell the couple their legals rights for this scenario like, \"hey you can force this sale since you all signed.\" The lender and title company want to get paid.\n\nI used to work mortgages.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I was thinking.
