You could have let her know beforehand that this was her last chance to be on time or you weren't going to invite her to things anymore. Actually, this is a conversation you should have had with her a long time ago. \"Friend, I feel disrespected when you don't show up to our activities on time. is there anything I can do to help you be more punctual?\" \"Friend, it hurts my feelings when you abandon our plans at the last minute to do something else. In the future, could you give me more notice?\"  You also could have told her that you are frustrated with her disrespecting your time so you decided to make other plans. Your communicating better may not have helped, but it was the adult thing to do.\n\nAlso, as a friend who knows what it's like to have ADHD, you could share some strategies you use that work for you. If she is uninterested in using them, then you at least you tried.", "She actually has a lot of support, and a lot of the newer people in the group are like-minded and flaky. It's one of those situations where what started as a group chat with just my close friends has morphed into mostly a collection of people who I would not have started socializing with of my own volition :') I've been able to get along with the others in an \"activity buddies\" kind of way, but when they can't even be bothered to show up for the activities I'm not really sure what else is left.", "This. NTA.", "Remove from chat", "NTA\n\nIt is pretty common for those who are flakey and eternally late to hold a doublestandard where their time is concerned. IF they're late they owe no apologies, but if you're late it's an eternal grudge.", "My favorite radio psychologist, Dr. Joy Browne, used to say \" I'll wait 15 minutes for anybody, 20 minutes for nobody\". Has worked for me for years now...", "Oh honey! This isn't about anything but CONTROL. She has it, and she is not going to give it up to you. As long as you keep associating with her, it will ALWAYS be your job to wait for her, that will never change.\nYou're NTA, but drop out of that group chat and just get together with your real friends. And block your late, soon-to-be-ex friend.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nShe thinks it\u02bbs disrespectful for everyone else to not live their lives on her timetable.\n\nI would never wait on her again.", "NTA \nGet rid of her. You won't miss her. Even the good things, if there are any, she doesn't respect you or your time and that isn't cool", "NTA\n\nYou've clearly communicated the issue and she clearly knows. By now, she's consciously choosing to be late. She's also not responsible for having ADHD, but she's responsible for how she manages it. If she isn't and is always late because of it, she's letting her ADHD overtake her life and genuinely needs help.\n\nShe hasn't changed because you've only talked about it without consequences. You have to treat her as she's showing you to treat her. By now, she's showing you that asking her to do anything is asking her to have the basic respect to do something for you. She's saying NO. \n\nI have ADHD and other debilitating issues. If I want to do something, I put in the effort with my meds and the planning and the whatever to make sure I can go because I want to be with people I enjoy being around. If I can't, then I apologize and say I can't attend. If your friend can't arrive on time, then she shouldn't attend at all.", "NTA. The fact that she drops plans with you for others, she's not your friend. She's stringing you along and you are not a priority", "NTA  \nIf your account is accurate I can't see too many in the friend group siding with her. They must be as fed up as you are.", "Mild YTA for how you handled it. Normally you would NTA, but your petty handling of the issue means you've basically given your friend ammunition to use against you. Had you kept to the plan and been there, you would have been in the right.\n\nTo be clear, I think your friend is TA in general, but your handling of *this specific* instance means you're the asshole too.", "NTA but.... Obviously your friend sucks, and you have every right to be done with her antics, but the way you went about this isn't great.\n\nWhen you've allowed someone to step all over you for a long time, you can't expect them to magically know that you aren't willing to put up with it anymore. This is where you should have communicated with her and said, \"Hey, I really need you to show up on time. If you're late again, I'm going to stop making plans with you because it's really disrespectful of my time.\"\n\nInstead, you mentally decided this was her last chance and decided to test her, knowing she'd fail. When she texted to say she was going to get some things at the store, that would have been a great time to text back and say, \"I can't believe you're doing this again. I'm leaving, enjoy your brunch.\"\n\nSo even though she's in the wrong, she's pissed because it was apparently fine before, but you changed the rules and now it's not fine but you didn't say anything. Which again, I get WHY and I don't really blame you, but it's not a great strategy if you want others to understand your actions and not think you were the jerk.\n\nBoundaries - ones you communicate and follow through with - are your friend here", "\"and in my head I decided this was gonna be her last chance\"\n\nESH. Communication is important in relationships. Try it next time.", "YTA. I'm amazed there are so many NTAs here. I don't think anyone blames you for being fed up with her but you handled it very poorly. She at least was texting you to let you know her timeline, disrespectful of your time as it was. But to just leave without saying a word and think you would still be friends with her after that is ridiculous. Your torched the friendship and that's your right. But you should own the consequences. You can only control your actions not hers and you behaved badly. No matter how understandable it was still petty AF.", "NTA for leaving because your friend was late again, but YTA for playing games with her. I think it would've been better to just text her to say, \"You're 30 minutes late, so I'm leaving.\" Then you could've just contacted her later to say that you don't want to make plans with her anymore because she's always 15-45 minutes late, and you think that's discourteous and disrespectful. You could also offer to give your friend tips on how to get to places on time. It's good info if she gets defensive or doesn't apologize. That tells you a lot about her emotional maturity and whether or not you want to continue the relationship.", "YTA. You get irritated because she does this crap, but are somehow surprised when you do the same. What did you expect? Heaven forbid you actually talk to her like an adult. Nta for not wanting to put more effort into the relationship but that was a dick move & you know it.", "I like this.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m not even sure she likes OP.This is so dis-respectful .", "Sure, if you\u2019re all in 7th grade.", "I mean objectively speaking, at minimum this has to be an ESH (not that I agree) because the friend is an asshole for agreeing to meet for brunch and then running an errand. Like...you can't deny that's asshole behavior, you just can't.\n\nBut how pathetic is it that a grown adult should need it spelled out for them that their constant disrespectful behavior is harming the relationship? That should be obvious. And then to suggest that it should be OP's responsibility to help a grown-ass woman manage her ADHD and be more punctual? No thanks, I'd rather not have to play mommy to my adult friends.", "Just start a new group chat with the people you\u2019re close to.", "There's your answer then. Losing those folks will free you up to spend time with the ones who actually matter to her.\n\nThe petty in me would have responded that I just had to go to thebstore for a few things. Then text her back about 6 hours later, \"Just pulled up\"\n\nNTA", "i feel like how and when she sends ss is important. like if people that actually matter to OP wanna hear her side then i\u2019m in support of just providing evidence, but group chat drama is so wild to me so i see you\u2019re point", "She's just matching the flakes pettiness", "why bother? yk? like you\u2019ve already lost her, you should maintain your decency in the group so the others don\u2019t think you\u2019re just as annoying"]}
