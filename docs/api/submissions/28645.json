You could have let her know beforehand that this was her last chance to be on time or you weren't going to invite her to things anymore. Actually, this is a conversation you should have had with her a long time ago. \"Friend, I feel disrespected when you don't show up to our activities on time. is there anything I can do to help you be more punctual?\" \"Friend, it hurts my feelings when you abandon our plans at the last minute to do something else. In the future, could you give me more notice?\"  You also could have told her that you are frustrated with her disrespecting your time so you decided to make other plans. Your communicating better may not have helped, but it was the adult thing to do.\n\nAlso, as a friend who knows what it's like to have ADHD, you could share some strategies you use that work for you. If she is uninterested in using them, then you at least you tried.", "She actually has a lot of support, and a lot of the newer people in the group are like-minded and flaky.
