She had lots of problems at her previous workplace and her friends have mostly moved on to other things with kids etc so she says her friends at this new work are making her feel happy being at work for once, especially her new friend Craig. \n\nThey text all the time, he's married as well but they have work in common and chat about that and seem to have other things in common. His wife seems fine with the friendship. I'm a bit wary of it but I do trust her completely.\n\nHowever tonight really concerned me. She told me she was going for a quick drink after work with colleagues then going to a female friends house for drinks, so I assumed this was the plan still.\n\nHowever our daughter called her at about 10:30pm, couldn't get through. So I messaged her female friend to see if she was still there. No reply, so I called her again. This time I got through and found out she went straight from work to the bar with just Craig and they had been chatting there since about 5pm and just lost track of time. So she hadn't told me about this change of plan and had spent 6+ hours having drinks with Craig with no indication of when she would be back.\n\nI got really annoyed and said have fun partying with Craig and hung up. Texted to tell her I was annoyed that she hadn't told me the change of plan and that personally I find that level of closeness a bit weird between two straight colleagues of the opposite sex.\n\nShe is saying she's upset that I don't trust her and they're just friends and he's never done anything and she obviously has nothing to hide since everything has been in the open. Which I guess is true since she lets me see texts between them and stuff. They were working on work stuff tonight apparently. I told her that I trust her but not him since I don't even know him and I know what men are like generally. What man wants to spend 6 hours in a bar talking to a female friend? \n\nEven if he doesn't have those intentions I'm a bit worried how close they're becoming, they seem to spend more time talking to each other than me and my wife do, and he's more successful and confident than me so it might be insecurity.\n\nI feel a bit bad for my reaction now but should I?", "created_utc": 1686960313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bc1bd/aita_getting_annoyed_at_my_wife_for_night_out/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s certainly possible it\u2019s totally platonic, but that is just disrespectful behavior.", "NTA. Having a drinks with a coworker after work, regardless of sex,  can absolutely be fine..... however,  6+ hours  \"lost track of time\" and not answering phone calls/texts?!? NOT ok. This is very suspicious.  And how exactly do you know his wife is ok with this? Because your wife said so? I'm willing to bet she is not ok with it either, if she even knows about this relationship.", "Been there, lived that. This is fishy. There's an emotional affair happening at very least. The question is are you going to ignore the red flags before it turns into a physical affair like I did?", "NTA\n\nThis \u2018oh can\u2019t we just be two friends hanging out?\u2019 song and dance is heard far too often before people cheat. Of course two straight people of opposite sexes can be friends, but the misdirect of plans and defensiveness of your wife justified your lack of trust.", "NTA. Lying about the drinks things is a big red flag. Also do grown adults really need to be texting their coworkers all the time? I'm not sure, seems weird but also could be platonic. Have her introduce you guys.", "This is cheating plain and simple. If she doesn\u2019t want to find another job then she can find another husband because I\u2019d be gone that night if I were you. If they haven\u2019t done the touchy-feely thing yet it going to happen real soon and then it\u2019ll be off to the motel room on \u201cgirls night\u201d.", "NTA, this whole situation is sus. I don\u2019t blame you for not trusting Craig. There\u2019s no good reason for a married man to drink alone with his married female friend all evening.", "NTA. You're not okay with the level of whatever that's happening right now. She's prioritizing spending extensive time with someone else over you. Your feelings need to matter to her, or what's the point of being married? \n\nTime to have a chat and find a compromise you can both accept.", "Nta. This is the beginning of an EA. Enlist this guys wife as I bet she had no idea they were alone.", "I don't think so. At the bare minimum she should have kept you updated on her whereabouts. If my wife did the same it would throw up some red flags for sure. \n\n\nAt the end of the day only you know your wife and your marriage though. If you're uncomfortable with it it's probably for a reason and justified.", "NTA. I do believe men and women can be friends regardless of what 'When Harry met Sally' portrays. However, you're both married and there need to be boundaries set for your friends. Your wife clearly doesn't have them. However, she might just be enjoying a new friendship and it's better to talk about your situation, rather than filing for divorce like some people have mentioned here.", "I haven\u2019t lost that much track of time in a LONG time. There\u2019s something deeper there. She may not even be aware of it. But it\u2019s definitely there and she\u2019s got some tough choices to make. You are NTA at all.", "Went for drinks for 6 hours?  Tell her she went on a date with her coworker and lied about where she was and who she was with.  Does this sound like someone you can trust?  She is starting an emotional affair even if they didn't do anything physical. \n\nI would tell her, \"Hey, I'm going to chat a lot with a female coworker, tell you I'm hanging with colleagues but just go get drinks with her all night and see if she is ok with that.", "NTA, sure some of your emotions may partly be fueled by insecurity (as you've pointed out); you're not wrong to be upset at her changing her plans without telling you. I feel like clear communication/transparency and trust go hand in hand so if she's not telling you about change in plans then it might lead to trust issues down the line. If this is the first time she's forgotten to tell you and it doesn't happen again then it's fine, we all make mistakes. But if this becomes a recurring thing, then you should have another conversation with her.", "I would say you reacted this way because of a bit of insecurity there, why don\u2019t you ask your wife if the 4 of you can go on a double date or something so you can all meet each other?", "NAH. Ok so I work primarily with males. I am a woman exec who works in a very male dominated industry. One of my closest work friends is a male colleague, and there have definitely been nights where we\u2019re drinking and working on a presentation or reviewing work current events until late in the evening. There is zero sexual attraction between us, we\u2019re both happily married. I don\u2019t have the kind of relationship where I\u2019m constantly texting my husband and vice versa, so on nights where this happens, husband knows I\u2019m with colleague and knows I\u2019ll get home late. Because we have communicated that. That seems to be the breakdown here. I disagree with the people that are saying this is textbook cheating. \n\nAll that said, if you are feeling a certain type of way about this, the best thing to do it tell your wife about your thought. I just want you to think about this: true work relationships can exist and can be totally platonic. I would perhaps do some soul searching to figure out what about the situ bothers you so much.", "NTA.\n\n\"she went straight from work to the bar with just Craig and they had been chatting there since about 5pm and just lost track of time. So she hadn't told me about this change of plan and had spent 6+ hours having drinks with Craig with no indication of when she would be back.\"\n\n6 hours?  Lost track of time?  Dude, you need to file for divorce.  This is an emotional affair, which is worse (MUCH WORSE) than a sexual affair.  Bluntly speaking, if she was fucking him on the regular, that would be better than what she's actually doing now.\n\nSexual partners are easy to replace.  But your wife and Craig have connected on a much more intimate level than if they were just bumping uglies.\n\nIf your state requires it, the little you've posted here would be obvious \"grounds\" to sue for a divorce...and the judge would grant one without hesitation.  Further, you could file a lawsuit against Craig for alienation of affection.\n\nI know it's possible (not a good idea, but possible) for married people to have friends of the opposite sex, who is not also a friend of the spouse.  But that's not what's happening here.  Craig has replaced the husband, emotionally speaking.  Game Over.  This marriage is done.  Nothing but paperwork left.  :(\n\nedit:  I almost forgot to add:  Craig's wife also has \"grounds\" to sue for divorce now.  And she should.  Immediately.", "INFO Is your reaction because she spent all night at a bar with a friend, because the friend is a straight male, or because she changed her plan without telling you, or because you think drinks alone with the male friend was the plan all along and she lied about the plan to go out with multiple colleagues and then to a female friend's house? Second, did you clearly explain which of the above is the reason for your response.", "NTA.  How can you trust a partner that lies about their plans?  If \"everything has been in the open\" then why lie about her plans?  She was gone for HOURS.  Your daughter couldn't reach her.  She owes you a **big** apology and needs to practice 100% honesty from this point forward, as well as not prioritizing coworkers over family.", "NTA. Emotional cheating is cheating. Not sure that's whats going on but it could be. If your uncomfortable with their relationship because of this she should respect that. Guessing she wouldn't like it if you spent 6+ hours with a female she did not know and that you texted with constantly.", "You should tell his wife.", "Don\u2019t forget to save this post so that you can share it on r/infidelity in a couple of weeks/months", "Nta. Trust your gut. Your wife found a work husband.", "A little bit of ESH\n\nPeople of the opposite sex can be friends, with nothing more than anything platonic between them. \nMy partner and I both have close friends of opposite genders, that doesn't automatically mean we're attracted to them. You overreacted however  \n\n\nOn the other hand there was a breakdown in communication. As a parent she should have been contactable and made you aware of the change of plans should anything happen to a child. Although, it sounds as if they're in their teens and this is unlikely", "NTA,\n\nDon\u2019t let her gaslight you by saying you do not trust her. It doesn\u2019t make sense she didn\u2019t tell you of her change of plans. Also it\u2019s a huge red flag that it\u2019s just that guy and talking for hours? You\u2019re married there should be boundaries when it comes to those of the opposite sex. You know your wife better then anyone here, but definitely need to sit down and talk to her about his. If it bothers you, you need to set clear boundaries and she needs to respect them.", "NTA but she might not be either. \nHear me out; it\u2019s ok to be a bit jealous and insecure sometimes, it\u2019s also ok to find other people attractive and interesting. A relationship is about facing challenges and still choosing each other, she may face temptation and that\u2019s ok so long as she chooses to remain faithful to the relationship. Just because she has been out doesn\u2019t mean she has done anything wrong and she has seemingly been open about everything with Craig but ultimately you can not control what anyone will do. But if you want the relationship to work you have to trust each other, in the end she will prove you right or wrong for believing in her but either way you will have your answer.", "YTA and NTA at the same time.\n\nNTA: Your wife should\u2019ve told you about the change of plans and contacted you about it.\n\nYTA: For your reasons opposing your wife's friendship also I feel like you\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing. A male and female can have a friendship and not have other intentions. The man is married himself and even his wife doesn\u2019t seem to care as much as you. Your wife forgot to call you cool then you call her to check in and tell her to check in. Btw, why didn\u2019t you just call her on her phone if you were so worried? It doesn\u2019t sound like she was dodging your calls it sounds like she did just lose track of time which happens when you\u2019re out having fun. And you made no effort to talk to her personally before the 6 hours. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not even close to the worry wart that you are but if my husband told me he was going out for drinks I definitely wouldn\u2019t let 6 hours go by without a check-in.\n\nOverall chill out and just trust your wife. Also, my ass is bisexual and so is my husband and if we were to operate on your logic we\u2019d have no friends \ud83d\ude05", "NTA\n\nI told my wife on our second date that opposite sex friendships doesn't work for me.  If she insisted on the right to do so, she would not be with me.", "YTA\n\nYou either trust her, or you don't. \n\nIf you're insecure, work on the marriage. Find time for each other. Work on communication. Express needs and desires, while inquiring about and exploring hers.\n\nIf she's gone as far as showing you messages, and has been open, that's what matters. \n\nDistrusting his intentions only matters if you expect him to force himself on her against her will. \n\nUnless that's the actual concern, your alleged trust in her is what counts.", "Yta, im probably gonna get downvoted. \n\nDid her not updating you on what time she will be home ah yes. However you didn\u2019t mention this as a reoccurring incident. This happening once is not that big of deal with not an emergency happened. Communication to avoid it happening in the future. She told you that it might be just her and craig. \n\nYour reaction to finding out is ah move. Instead of communicating your feelings you made a passive aggressive comment and hung up. Your comment was teenage behavior. \n\nMen and women can be friends. New friendships are exciting. As long as she is not crossing in to more than friends and appropriate boundaries. There nothing wrong with their friendship. Expressing feelings lack of time together. See about a date night. To get more couple time.\n\nYou are being insecure. You either trust your wife or you dont. You have to decide if you trust your wife on how she would react right if craig did something. Your trust isn\u2019t about craig. You are only gonna cause problems within your marriage by allowing your insecurities get the better of you. \n\nExpress your insecurities and allow your wife to reassure you. However do not make your insecurities about trusting your wife.", "Esh \u2014She did mention it could just be her and Craig, \n\nshe responded to you, her husband, even though she ignored your daughter (which doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable, as you were home to deal with the daughter).  \n\nAnd she did tell you she was going to the bar, so it doesn\u2019t seem like she hid anything from you.  \n\nSeems like a communication thing, tbh.", "No, tell her this is your boundary.
