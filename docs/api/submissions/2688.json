We all do stupid stuff as kids. But when you tell someone you don't like them bringing up a story from your past (period) and they continue to do so is just plain bullying.\n\nJokes are funny.

That's a story best left buried.", "NTA.  \n\n100% not your fault, which I hope you understand, but that is absolutely disgusting and you are right to feel sick about it.  They are incredibly sick to EVER bring that up.  Your family is TA.

Your family is SO wrong.", "NTA. Your parents should have been supervising you both and should have been explaining age-appropriate boundaries around sexual behavior.

Not okay.", "you both were kids. if it only was kissing thats totally normal behavior for this age group. still i understand you feel akward about this but dont let it get to you.feeling guilt or/and disgust for something like this when you were innocent children would be you harming yourself. also weird for your brother. but if you feel akward or uncomfortable around him for this and other reasons try talking to a therapist. still i dont think your family is right in doing things that make you feel uncomfortable!

Dear Lord. I remember my eldest being disgusted at a teenage couple kissing and declaring 'you're not brother and sister!' during Covid rules. It's going to turn your stomach now but I wouldn't assume your brother is a big pervert. Even if he thought it was something naughty or tabboo (quite likely) it doesn't make it sexual. He was just naieve and it's not a huge deal, but people shouldn't be bringing it up now and putting you off your food.", "I think he knew. He was old enough to know. And hided it.\n\nI'm so sorry", "> He was just naieve and it's not a huge deal\n\nTonguing and groping your *six* year old sister at *eight* for *three months* before getting caught is very much a big deal.

What it indicates we can only theorise, either way it doesn't change what he did and how she reacts to it over a decade later.", "She didn't say he groped her. My kids grab me and their Dad all the time, it's not sexual. Her problem is that her family keep bringing it up and making it a big deal. Of course she's NTA for how she reacts, but people theorising that an 8 year old is a sexual pervert isn't really helpful and while they of course theorise, it is disturbing to sexualise kids that young. She's already sick to her stomach, why make it worse?", "Everyone here is jumping to conclusions how the brother is a sexual abuser while he was litterally a child as well when it happened. Him hiding it could very well be because \"it's what adults do and we're not adults so we're not allowed yet so we should hide it\". Maybe he was laughing it off but feels just as sick inside, hiding his true feelings because the other family members will laugh at him, just like they laughed at OP. We don't know his intentions when it happened. Maybe they were bad, but maybe it was just a dumb kid.\n\nEveryone automatically painting a child as a sexual predator is just as sick imo.", "At a holiday dinner 5 years from now, \"How come OP didn't come home  today?\"  hmmmm, it'll be a mystery.", "NTA.    That's not a joke.   And your family sounds like it has major issues.", "NTA- they are . Not sure if there was abuse in the family as most were suggesting or it was seeing and copying some one else as both of you were very young. However, they are weird for joking about it . It is not your first kiss as you did not fully comprehend what was going on and to count as such involves and includes feelings of a more romantic nature which you were completely not capable of at that age and with your brother. I think you should have a strong family talk so that they do not bring it up again.", "NTA. This was a traumatizing memory that actively upsets you. It\u2019s not a cutesy funny childhood story. Me making my family attend my imaginary wedding to Danny phantom is a cutesy childhood story, not months of unintentional incest between children who didn\u2019t know any better and didn\u2019t realize the full weight of what they did until they were older and the shame settled in.", "This isn't your first kiss. If it was then all the smooches you get from parents on the lips when you're little and the rogue granny kiss would count. Don't say this is your first kiss. Kids do weird shit and you were little. What your family is doing is wrong in so many ways. Each person in that room has done what would be deemed 'sexual' stuff when they were kids but kids just explore with each other. If co-oercion or pressure was included, a massive age difference or adult influence then that is a different story.", "NTA, it sounds like this all comes from a lack of parenting. When you are a kid your parents were so unaware of what you and your sibling were doing it took them 3 months to find out what you two had been up to; and now today, your sister and older brother were straight up bullying you at the dinner table and they didn't step in.", "Her brother was 8 when that situation occurred, not even in puberty yet. I agree that it\u2019s likely that there is a predator in the family, but if that is  the case then more likely than not it was not the brother, but someone else who started that chain with *him* being the victim - and probably told him that nonsense of \u201cthat is how adults greet each other\u201d.", "Edit: not even kids who didn\u2019t know any better, but based on some comments from OP, either may have known and have manipulated OP on purpose. So they\u2019re acting like child to child sexual abuse is somehow cute and funny. \n\nAnd even if op\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t doing it knowingly, the fact of the matter is that it\u2019s a source of child sexual trauma for OP. A child unknowingly did sexual things with a family member for months because she didn\u2019t know any better. That\u2019s not something to laugh at, ever.", "Right? The other question is where her *8 yo!!* brother learned that? There is definitely neglect involved and maybe even something happened to her brother while the family makes fun of them.\n\nThe family is just awful.", "Oft yeah I didnt think of that too!! This is not a laughing matter at all", "Yeah this is it for me. Like if you're feeling this much of a visceral reaction and you have no support in your daily life, you need to seek external support to process this"]}
