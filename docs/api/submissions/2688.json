It would be a lighthearted family story if it was just a singular peck, but with the additional context, it's definitely not something to be used as light ribbing.", "They knew it would upset you and did it anyway. This is something best forgotten. You were kids and didn;' know but it's best forgotten. Not something to rib you about. NTA.", "NTA\n\n They should understand that this is a traumatic memory for you and as such it will probably never be funny.  I hope you're able to draw some clear boundaries with them about never bringing it up in the future especially in front of outsiders", "honestly so sick of people who confidently call their bullying \"jokes\"\n\nit's not funny. it's humiliating. if the other person isn't laughing the joke wasn't funny it just made you feel good because you got to feel powerful over someone else. get the fuck out.\n\nNTA\n\nedit: also, it's \"weird kid stuff\". every kid does things that aren't just cute-weird but weird-weird. it's fine. (i mean, like, to this extent it's fine, obviously not *everything* is fine). i've walked into my younger sibling's rooms and turned around immediately pledging never to talk about that. to a certain extent, kids do shit they wouldn't want to bring up as adults", "Nta.  We all do stupid stuff as kids. But when you tell someone you don't like them bringing up a story from your past (period) and they continue to do so is just plain bullying.\n\nJokes are funny. Repeatedly using information to cause someone emotional harm is not a joke.", "NTA,\n\nAnd honestly I'm sorry. I won't judge at all, but you have a right to not want to bring up something like that. That should not be a topic. Like... they'd probably think it was okay to bring it up not only to you but to romantic partners. That's a story best left buried.", "NTA.  \n\n100% not your fault, which I hope you understand, but that is absolutely disgusting and you are right to feel sick about it.  They are incredibly sick to EVER bring that up.  Your family is TA.  You need to assert that boundary that you NEVER want to hear about it again, and get medieval on them if they ever bring it up again.  That is the hill to die on if ever there was one.  Your family is SO wrong.", "NTA. Your parents should have been supervising you both and should have been explaining age-appropriate boundaries around sexual behavior. They actually failed to protect both of you in this situation. Now they\u2019re making jokes about it and humiliating you? Nope. Not okay.", "you both were kids. if it only was kissing thats totally normal behavior for this age group. still i understand you feel akward about this but dont let it get to you.feeling guilt or/and disgust for something like this when you were innocent children would be you harming yourself. also weird for your brother. but if you feel akward or uncomfortable around him for this and other reasons try talking to a therapist. still i dont think your family is right in doing things that make you feel uncomfortable! NTA", "How did your parents allow that to go on for 3 months?", "NTA.  And if I were you, I would lay down the law:  if that happens again, no more family get togethers.  Period.\n\nNo discussion.", "NTA.  Jokes are supposed to be funny.  You know what\u2019s not funny?  Laughing at someone else\u2019s trauma and writing it off as just being a \u201cjoke.\u201d \n\nI hope you can tell them how this sickens you and you don\u2019t appreciate it being brought up, and hopefully they listen", "\"You're too sensitive,\" is easily translated, from Narcissist to English.  It's equivalent to \"I don't like consequences, for being an asshole.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "Ah, the cry of the abuser:\"you're too sensitive!\".", "I would take a huge break from these family get togethers if your other siblings don\u2019t appreciate how wrong your brother was to abuse your trust and na\u00efvet\u00e9. You need to spend time with people who make you feel safe.", "INFO needed. Did they know about your first kiss with your brother prior to this conversation? \n\nIf they did, then they are assholes. If they didn\u2019t then it likely was just a harmless question reminiscing about growing up. Either way, I can see why you are sensitive on the topic and thus NTA. \n\nI\u2019m curious to know where your brother got the notion that people make out at 8 years old to say hello, especially with their siblings. I don\u2019t have kids but 8 seems old enough to understand that this is not something siblings do\u2026did he ever do anything sexual in nature as you both got older?", "I get so disgusted when families confuse \"joking \" and teasing with bullying.   That is what they are doing when they continue to tease you about an event that is embarrassing and humiliating.  \n\nYou are NTA.  Next time they bring it up,  speak up and tell them to stop.   Humiliating someone is not joking.   You may yell and shout to get your point across.", "NTA. your family is awful, i'm sorry to say. it's terrible that you had to go through that. that isn't a joke, either. that is bringing up something that clearly has a traumatic effect on you, and is weird to bring up in general. people don't want to be reminded of things like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother groomed and sexually assaulted you (based on your comments stating his behaviours which scream to me that he KNEW what he was doing was wrong).

But you might be able to laugh about this in the future. Maybe.", "I agree.", "OP's further explanations in the comments makes it seems not weird kid stuff but malicious on her brother's part.", "I don\u2019t know myself.

The fact that he continued to tell you to keep it a secret suggests he knew it was wrong. The fact that you didn\u2019t just explicitly tell me that your brother has never done anything else sexual in nature as you grew up also makes me concerned. \n\nJust know, regardless of your brothers issues this wasn\u2019t your fault. If you feel comfortable, it may be wise to go to a therapist and then ask your parents to come to a session to discuss the situation in a controlled environment.

I'm very literal so questions like \"first kiss\" etc make me panic because i find lying/not answering questions impossible, but the truth is very traumatic (and my husband was my first bf and we reconneced later, so firsts get mentioned in reminiscing and things)\n\nI've reframed it and will say \"first consensual XYZ\" because it still allows me to enjoy those firsts as other people do, without the weight of the firsts that were taken from me\n\nnot sure if that helps, but its helped me if you need it", "Sweetie, he laughed while you had a very visceral reaction to it. This is not normal, deep down I think you already know that. your family are down playing it and making you the problem, so they don\u2019t have to admit what happened to you. None of this is your fault, and i\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.", "I am so sorry that he did that to you and that your family is ignoring his abuse.", "I\u2019m so sorry that this is such a hard subject, but I think you\u2019ve had a gut feeling that this is more sinister than what your family has tried to make it out to be and I hope you\u2019re getting some validation for those feelings now. I really suggest you take these questions and thoughts to a therapist and work through what really happened.\n\nAnd please remember that blood family doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be abusers or toxic to your mental health, and it\u2019s okay to step away or cut contact off completely when you need to.", "It's not your fault. You trusted someone who you *should* have been able to trust, someone who should have protected you from getting hurt. You were a child that didn't know. It was not okay what happened to you. You're not to blame for what he did.", "NTA\n\nI usually don\u2019t comment much on AITA posts, but I\u2019m really worried about your well-being. Your family is clearly in the wrong, and it seems like they\u2019re in denial about a family member being a potential predator so they try to skirt around the issue by \u201cjoking\u201d (ahem more like disregarding you, the victim). I hope you seek help to heal from this experience. What happened to you isn\u2019t your fault at all. Your concerns are valid. Please take care of yourself.", "It's also likely that your brother isn't the only one who was up to no good in the family, or possibly among the neighbors. Because usually kids don't think this stuff up, that early, without having been abused themselves.\n\nBut that's your brother's problem, other than for purposes of watching your back against any other possible creeps in the area."]}
