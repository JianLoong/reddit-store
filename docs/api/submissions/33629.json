You can disagree with her mother's choice, that's your right and that's perfectly fine, but you cannot meddle in something that is not your business, it's not your choice to make. And if you want to go the excuse of \"oh I don't lie to my children\", it's not a lie that she's their cousin, I highly doubt your children specifically went and told you hey mom, is Rae adopted?

But the thing is, none of the other kids knew they had an older sister, that their mum had actually had an older child before them. They also had never met their grandmother so it was easy to keep from them. Why the fuck did my mum tell ME about it?

One day when my cousins and I were having a mild disagreement, Janelle blurted out to Mary, \"Grandpa isn't even your real grandpa anyway!\"\n\nMary was crushed.

The post question is very simple. Is OP TA for telling their kids their cousin is not biologically related to them? And the answer is yes. BECAUSE IT WASN'T HER PLACE TO TELL ANYONE, because it's not OP's child. She didn't even have to lie to her own kids. Because she IS their cousin, bio related or not it's not relevant UNLESS you WANT to make it relevant to make some distinction. It was not her thing to tell and she told it purely for gossip. How is it relevant to OP's kids if the child is related to them by blood or not? \"Oh I don't lie to my kids\" it's bs in this case because it's something the direct person asked to be kept secret and if they ask me hey please let's not discuss this or mention this, I may not agree with their choice to hide something but IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ME", "It's not about marginalising the relationship, not knowing can lead to a whole host of issues, sometimes you're lucky and you don't need to know, but often the kid will figure it out themselves, especially if they have medical issues, or even simple things like going to school and realising your alleles like eye colour don't match up quite right. It also makes a difference in blood type and can impact any future need for blood transfusions because obviously universal blood is under demand, and if they know which blood type they are then they might be able to tell a dr in an emergency what they need and be able to receive it faster. Genes play a really important role in many illnesses.\n\nThat doesn't take into account the emotional wellbeing of the child either, children with parents who haven't been told about their bio parents have often described not feeling quite \"right\", as if theres something that means they don't fit in, and not knowing why.

By the time they\u2019re old enough to understand they\u2019re also old enough to understand that actually genetics are complicated and actually two brown haired parents can have a blonde haired child. \n\nIf they ask questions and they\u2019re old enough to understand the answers then maybe they\u2019re old enough to understand the full complexity of the situation\u2026 none of that is indicated in OPs post. Nor in this comment.", "Which is exactly why I said OP also sucks.", "This is why all adopted kids in the UK have a life storybook so they are told from infancy the truth.

I was the same, I knew my step dad wasn't my bio dad before I could understand what that meant.", "It\u2019s not about keeping her ignorant. It\u2019s about not spreading the secret so it keeps getting bigger and bigger until it hurts everyone when it comes out. The fact is always going to be that the truth would have been easier from her parents instead of another child that shouldn\u2019t have known in the first place and that she wouldn\u2019t have distrusted our whole family if the adults had kept it all between them and not told the cousins that were her age or younger. \n\nWhether the secret should exist or not, there\u2019s no points to be won in spreading it around knowing that it\u2019s going to harm a child when it gets out.", "I\u2019m saying she would have had cousins to come to and speak with and that it might have helped.", "I want to know how old OP's kids are.

Happens in my family and im sure it happens in other families too.", "Op can't stop her cousin from lying to her child about her bio dad, but that doesn't mean she has to follow in her footsteps and lie to her own kids as well. It sounds like she informed her kids about the whole the situation and they never told the cousin, because they knew it would be wrong for her to hear this info coming from them.\n\nIt's effed up of the cousin and her husband to lie to their own kid about who her bio dad is.", "If only experts hadn't been recommending against that for over a decade.", "My guess is that you don\u2019t realize that regardless of op telling her kids which I doubt are actually kids at this point.

But that is her parent's fault because they hid it from her.", "OP says someone on the child's mother's side spilled the beans.  And it isn't private if it was known beforehand and then asked to keep secret, then it's a group of people withholding information from 1 person while the rest know about it.\n\nHiding a child's adoptive background is what's truly harmful IMO.

Also yes, genetics are complicated, but a lot of times people with \"rare\" traits that neither parents (and siblings) share is not because of some special circumstance that lines up (like mine did) \n\nAlso kids are usually taught in black and white, so we might know that it's complicated and there's exceptions etc. but a child might not know that and still question it", "YES WHY DO THEY DO THAT?! \n\nI have known ALL the family secrets for years, because my aunts and mom would just talk about it like it was common knowledge, in my hearing (my bedroom was right next to the kitchen, so even if my door was closed, I could hear them).   \nBUT IT ISN'T common knowledge and I'm the only one who knows of the cousins, I think? I don't even know.  My cousin gave up twins and many years later I was talking to a different cousin who also had twins and I was like \"I am worried I might have twins\" and she says \"why would you? I had twins due to IVF.\"  And I called my mom and asked if everyone knew about the adopted out twins or what?? \"OH no I don't think anyone else in the family knows about it.\"   \nWELL SHIT.  Thankfully we have more distant cousins with twins that I could use as an excuse there. \n\nWe're in our 40's to 60's now and most of the elders are gone, and that cousin's other kids reconnected with the twins, so that's not a secret anymore. But ugh.

Im talking generally now, not about OP's situation.\n\nMy youngest kids are 16, and over the previous year, I have been talking to them as if they are grown up (obviously not anything really inappropriate, nor do I give away anyone's secrets).\n\nI feel like this age is a premium time to really have an influence on my kids and and how they think about certain things.  My elder son is 21, and still very receptive to things I talk to him about, but he has grown in independence over the last few years, developing his own life, and relationships with other people.   He has formed his own opinions on various subjects.\n\nI wouldn't do it the same with younger kids, but at 16, my kids are still looking for input on what to think about various things.  I also feel that demonstrating to them that I am human, struggle with things etc, gives them a safe space for coming and talking to me about anything they struggle with themselves.  I don't put them in a position where they feel they have to carry me emotionally, but I do open up to them.", "That\u2019s just not true though, school and the internet will decide, the parents don\u2019t really have much of a say in that because it\u2019s hardly in their control", "I think you put too much weight on \u2018honesty at all costs\u2019. It\u2019s not okay for children to know something this life altering prior to their cousin who\u2019s life it actually affects. \nAnd do you think mom added in any caveat to her children about her brother still \u2018being her real dad no matter blood\u2019 kinda stuff? Probably not, but I hope so..", "It is absolutely private. You really think it\u2019s ok to gossip about adoptees origins?

There was no gossip. Define gossip\n\nAnd how do you know an adoptee is ready?"]}
