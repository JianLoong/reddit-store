Say instead of gifts for yourself or hubby you would really appreciate them donating to the college fund.", "NTA\n\nI was in your shoes. All the way down to legitimately believing MIL was gifting us stuff she would want in her house, without considering what we would want. She is a compulsive shopper. I pretty much decided the stuff she gifts us throughout the year are things that she buys, ends up not wanting, and can't return, so she gives them to us. \n\nI can't tell you how many wine openers, potholders, and useless kitchen gadgets she's given us. It's like she buys all the crap in the checkout line at TJ Maxx. Gets home, decides she doesn't need a strawberry stem picker, and gives it to us as an ode to Spring.\n\nAnd we used to display the stuff low-key when they visited. She'd be all \"Oh, I gave that to you! Remember?\" and I'd feign surprise, \"Oh! That's right! We use it all the time!\". We had a closet full of crap. Finally, I just threw it all away and told my partner that from now on when we get stuff we don't want or won't use, Goodwill. Immediately. It's much easier and less stressful... We don't want to tell her because she's a narcissist and would turn it around to be all about her. But since we stopped displaying stuff and faking like we like shit, she's really slowed it down. So I think by us faking like we liked everything, it actually encouraged her. So while you don't have to say anything to her, just stop pretending to like the things she gives you.\n\nJFC that's a lot of words I just typed. Sorry.", "So, I had a similar issue with my FIL when he was alive. It was maddening, but now that he has passed on, I wish we had valued him showing his love that way more then we did.\n\nAnyway, I suggest you start an amazon wish list that you send a link to to her and keep it up to date. That way its at least an attempt at guiding her towards your taste.\n\nLikewise, when she is in town, go shopping with her - oooh and ahhh over things you love and wish you had. As for the pottery, save a few key pieces that you DO like and if you have any friends who like the pottery, offer the pottery to them. Or, sell it but tell your MIL that you gave it to a friend (used loosely) who LOVED the pottery and you passed along SIL's business' information.\n\nFor the baby clothes, my guess is she doesn't remember most of what she buys and baby outgrows it pretty fast. So, again, keep a few key pieces that you DO like, take lots of photos of baby in them and send them to your MIL. Ignore the rest.", "NAH - cant ya\u2019ll just talk to them about this though? I mean what is your endgame here?", "NAH so far - Some people are just terrible at giving gifts, or lack the self-awareness to see that not everyone has their same tastes. But until you actually sit them down and have the conversation, you can\u2019t really call them assholes. \n\nYour husband really needs to lead the charge on this one, though. Appeasement is never an effective long-term strategy.", "NAH\n\nCalling either one of you AH would be too harsh. They think they are contributing to your household, you feel like you are collecting inventory.  In this case, keeping the peace may be keeping *certain* items, but anything after 18 months you and your husband can start to slip items into the Goodwill box. \n\nAt some point, you could (nicely) tell your in-laws you would be thrilled if they would start donating to your child's college fund and you've opened up an account for them to do that!", "NTA.

If you can\u2019t return it I can always donate it.\u201d\n\nIf he insists you take all this stuff anyway, tell him it\u2019s all going in his office/man cave/etc., but you aren\u2019t putting it in a shared space or hauling it out when they come visit.\n\nMake his spinelessness his problem from now on.", "NTA and it's best not to lie rather than keep appeasing her by putting out the stuff when they visit.

No AHs here.\n\nGiven you hang the artworks up and use the items when they visit, how are they to know these things aren\u2019t your taste?\n\nStop doing that. If they ask where X artwork went, say thank you for the artwork, but we found Y piece that we fell in love with. But you mentioned in another comment that they\u2019re \u2019avoid the confrontation\u2019 types, so it might not even come to that.", "NAH.  Your MIL wants to give you tangible reminders of their love and poor hubby\u2019s stuck in the middle. he probably feels guilty about giving away his mothers gifts since she seems to equate the gifts with her love and giving the gifts away may feel like a rejection of that love. And you just aren\u2019t into it because it too much unused stuff. I can\u2019t see an AH in sight. \n\nBtw, I have this same issue with my mother.  She thinks if she doesn\u2019t give me something every time we see each other, it isn\u2019t love. The stuff she gives is worthy only of the donation pile at goodwill. One of the *best* things I learned is to request certain gifts or give her suggestions on what i want to receive. I tend to ask for quality time, donations to favored charities, or food, since these are intangibles that I will not need to donate. I\u2019ve also found that most chronic gift givers don\u2019t mind direction on what, how and when to give.\n\nTip: you may want to stop falsely using their gifts when they visit as it only encourages getting gifts you are none to fond of. If your MIL is anything like my mother, she sees it as \u201cwell, they liked it enough to put it up on their wall/use it in their kitchen/dress their children in it, etc. so I guess it was success and they want more of that.\u201d  If they ask, gently explain to them that you have plates, home decor, etc. that you LOVE and that you rather not replace them, and they usually take it well. At least my mother did.", "YTA\n\nPeople being kind, generous, and loving is just so much more important than a mug fitting your style.

Your feelings are completely understandable, but sometimes our feelings should be ignored in favor of honoring somebody else's feelings.  The giving of gifts is an act of generosity.  Why or what is given is a giver's personal choice.  Most people try to give something that the receiver will like and use. Sometimes gifts are chosen because a giver loves something so much that it is assumed that the receiver will love it too.  MIL/FIL have doted on their children for all of their lives.  What's the harm in letting them continue?  Your decision.  You are entitled to it. Remember, we all share the equal opportunity to be wrong.\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA. If you like them, but not their presents, donate them. I doubt they will come and take inventory of what is in your house.  The paintings, well that is  tricky, but you seem to have worked that out.

Explain that you don't want them wasting their money on things that you won't ever use. If they balk at it, just tell them that you will be donating excess things to Goodwill. Then it's up to them to either follow the rules or not. \n\nOne of the things I seem to have said a great deal lately is that people use the \"It's not the gift, but the thought that counts\" adage to excuse thoughtless, lazy gifts. If your MIL actually put thought into the gifts, she could easily get things for you that you would want. My dad sends my sister a Home Depot card every Christmas because she does huge projects in her yard in the spring.
