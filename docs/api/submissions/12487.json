I can lock my dog away but they can't lock their cat away. I can leave the dog at home but they cannot come over to my place. It's the price we pay for the wellbeing of our pets that we chose to take care of. \n\nThanks for everyone involved. Guess I needed to vent, be called out and cool my head. \n\n\nEDIT 2\n\nWow, people are taking this much too seriously. This is not a serious dispute between my friend and me. Please, calm down and maybe vent a little online (not in this community though). \n\n............ \n\n\nMy best friend owns a cat. I own a dog. We barely make time to see each other so when the opportunity arises, we try to make most of it and meet. So tomorrow, we'd like to spend the evening together.\n\nI asked if I could bring my dog because I wouldn't want her to be alone for 4+ hours when she's already spent time alone at home when I work. \nMy friend said I couldn't bring the dog because of the cat.\nI asked whether we could separate the two by closing the door. I could even enter the room where we spend the evening through the garden.\nMy friend said no (friendly but firmly). \n\nMy thoughts on this:\nThat cat has 150qm of the house to avoid the dog. They wouldn't even see each other if I entered through the garden. The cat wouldn't be alone because my friends' family are home too and they spread around the house. \nMy friend knows and likes my dog. My dog is very shy and calm and happy to lay down and be ignored. She wouldn't roam or sniff or annoy anyone or beg for food or anything. She doesn't stink and doesn't lose coat. She's basically a piece of furniture once she's settled in. She's not interested in cats. My friend knows. My dog has already been there! But in summer when the cat was outside. \n\nSo now I have to leave one of our rare evenings together early because I can't let my dog be alone for too long because it seems to be the cat's birth right to be able to enter that one particular room. In the past, the cat used to leave that room anyway when there were people coming over, be there a dog or not.\nI like that cat. It's not the animals fault I'm angry. It's the feeling that my presence is worth less than the cat's freedom of movement for one evening. \n\nI understand that you wouldn't want to lock away your pet when they want to be with you. But now I have to leave my pet behind AND leave the night early.\n\nI haven't discussed this with my friend yet. I respect their decision since I'm their guest and I value our friendship. But at the moment as I'm typing this, I'm angry and hurt. \n\nAITA for being offended by my friend's request to not bring my dog to their home because their cat MIGHT be near?\n\nEDIT Apparently I need to act before I qualify as potential asshole.

They don't like change and get very stressed out when another animal comes into the house (even another cat!). Your friend's responsibility is toward taking care of her own pet, not yours.

I'm seriously asking, because none of my family and friends do that.", "YTA\n\nPeople have a right to say they don't want your dog in their house. It's the cat's home.

You don't get to decide on the house rules.  If the weather is nice where you live, meet her outside.", "YTA. \nRegardless of whether the cat and dog even see each other that\u2019s the cats home.

Either way you must respect your friends house rules.", "YTA\n\nI get all your points, and it's too bad you couldn't find a compromise with your friend, but you should also consider that merely introducing a dog into a cat's space is disruptive to the cat and you should respect that boundary. \n\nYou are asking for a special accommodation, so it's unfair of you to feel angry and hurt.

Pushing it makes you look like an entitled asshole. Having a dog in the house can traumatize many cats.", "YTA And this is simple. It isn't your house it is your friends. They could tell you don't come over unless you're wearing a clown outfit and guess what? That's the rule.  So don't go or get the clown shoes right? It is their house and their rules. You can ask but when told no, don't get offended. It's that simple. Don't like it? Invite them to your house. With their cat. As for the dog and being alone, it will be fine.

I own a dog. We barely make time to see each other so when the opportunity arises, we try to make most of it and meet. So tomorrow, we'd like to spend the evening together.\n\nI asked if I could bring my dog because I wouldn't want her to be alone for 4+ hours when she's already spent time alone at home when I work. \nMy friend said I couldn't bring the dog because of the cat.\nI asked whether we could separate the two by closing the door. I could even enter the room where we spend the evening through the garden.\nMy friend said no (friendly but firmly). \n\nMy thoughts on this:\nThat cat has 150qm of the house to avoid the dog. They wouldn't even see each other if I entered through the garden. The cat wouldn't be alone because my friends' family are home too and they spread around the house. \nMy friend knows and likes my dog. My dog is very shy and calm and happy to lay down and be ignored. She wouldn't roam or sniff or annoy anyone or beg for food or anything. She doesn't stink and doesn't lose coat. She's basically a piece of furniture once she's settled in. She's not interested in cats. My friend knows. My dog has already been there! But in summer when the cat was outside. \n\nSo now I have to leave one of our rare evenings together early because I can't let my dog be alone for too long because it seems to be the cat's birth right to be able to enter that one particular room. In the past, the cat used to leave that room anyway when there were people coming over, be there a dog or not.\nI like that cat. It's not the animals fault I'm angry. It's the feeling that my presence is worth less than the cat's freedom of movement for one evening. \n\nI understand that you wouldn't want to lock away your pet when they want to be with you.

I had never heard him growl before in all the years I had him.

His absolute favorite place was the shop I work in at the nearby Renaissance festival (lots of people to adore him there). He even went camping and on walks with me. Every time I put his harness on (which indicated that we're leaving the house), he would get incredibly excited. I always said he was a dog in a cat's body. I never had to train him. He was like this from the day he invited himself in.", "Tops?", "Yeah, to be honest, I have a tendency to be nice about it in the moment because I don't want to make a scene.

No consequences in the moment because I would be nice about it, but I'd never invite them back.", "They are amazing. Just rare.

Both times, they explicitly invited him without prompting. In contrast, the two cats I have still are the most high strung and insane creatures you could imagine! There's really a huge range of personalities with cats. I foster about 20 cats a year. I will probably foster fail if I encounter another cat with a similar personality to his.\n\nI really do miss my little adventure kitty.

First off taking a dog to someone's house not only uninvited, but when the person doesn't have dogs themselves is extremely selfish and entitled.  But to also displace a pet in that house and somehow feel as if you are being wronged is just crazy and beyond entitled AH behavior.\n\nMy aunt and uncle tried pulling this in the past at Christmas.  My parents never had or allowed animals in the house because my mother has asthma that is triggered by cats/dogs. And I have allergies that cause me to break out in hives, my eyes get extremely swollen and itchy, and my neck and throat get extremely itchy and I have minor difficulty breathing and wheezing is the best I can manage. And my aunt and uncle were both aware of this.  And they asked to bring both of their dogs because one was a new puppy and they didn't want to leave it home alone. And my parents said no. They brought the dogs anyway, walked them right inside and were told to etake them outside immediately.  And then they sulked the entire time that now they have to stay outside and aren't welcome inside because there is no fence and they don't want to tie them up with a short leash. And they acted as if we were the AHs because we prioritized breathing in our house over them bringing therendogs in which they were told not to bring.", "YTA. When I had my old lady dog people never minded that I brought her with me (I always asked) because she was well trained and old and basically slept all the time. Now that she\u2019s passed away and I have a puppy, people are less excited with me bringing him because he\u2019s more likely to chew things or pee on things and generally cause chaos.

It's okay to be upset if it's FEELS like you are the only one really trying for a friendship.\n\nNAH its okay to vent on the internet, it was okay to ask your friend.

I get your points and as a cat owner with friends with dogs, this \"issuse\" isn't new. I have a may-not-for-all solution. I know my cats and if the friend with the calm dog comes over this is Not a problem for my cats because they have enough space to avoid the dog.

If someone doesn't want your dog in their house that should be final regardless of their reason for saying no. The cat also deserves not to feel stressed in their own home.\n\nI agree the situation sucks but that is unfortunately a fact of life when you own a dog.

I am guessing that would be anywhere from 7-11 hours total. Dogs shouldn't be left inside for more than 6-8 hours max, and I have never done more than 5. It risks bladder and bowl issues, along with anxiety. They are trained to go outside and are stressed af and hold it as long as they possibly can when home alone. That is terrible for their health and training. Unless the dog has access to get in and out the house by themselves, it is a really cruddy thing to do. \n\nPersonally, my dog is too big to have a dog door, so that isn't possible for me. Others might live in areas not safe to have a dog door (predators to the animal, or the human variety being able to break in that way).

Cats aren't as obvious about it, but they need plenty of attention.  Sure he gets anxious when we leave him for awhile but he must just deal with it.
