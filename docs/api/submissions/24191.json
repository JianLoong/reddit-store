You're not anyone's personal ATM and if he's not paying you back there's no reason to lend him more money.", "NTA. Your friend isn't going to jail because you didn't help him. He's going to jail because he's irresponsible and undependable. If he tells you that his situation is in any way your fault, he is also not your friend.", "NTA\n\nYour friend dug his own hole, and your too strapped for cash to help him yet again.\n\nDo you know why divorce is so expensive?  Because it's worth it.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA do not pay. He needs to take responsibility for his own choices, you bailing him out is stopping him.", "NTA! Why do you feel obligated to help him anyway? I get it, he's a close friend, but he can't even pay you for previously borrowed money. You need to worry about yourself and not let his legal situation affect your own decisions. I'm sorry, but his problem at this point. You've done what you can and you're not improving his situation by enabling him.", "NTA. He needs to be responsible for his own self and actions. Sorry about your divorce, those suck. Hopefully you have a good lawyer.", "NTA\n\nMoney doesn't fix money problems. He will never stop asking you for money. That's evident by the fact that he hasn't paid you back yet and has gotten into more trouble which is going to prevent him from getting a job and earning money to pay back the original money,  nevermind the additional money he would need. \n\nI feel like I wrote that sentence terribly. Can anyone help me with my grammer please? \n\nAnyway, money won't help him. \n\nYou may love your friend and that's great. You can support him in other ways. Emotionally and mentally. But i'd cut him off financially. Good luck with everything going on in your own life.", "NTA. It's good that you were able to say no to somebody that is not entirely trustworthy. Given your own difficult situation, it's also very prudent. Helping people requires that the helper is in a safe position to do so. That's not selfish, that's common sense.", "NTA\n\nHe is not going to jail because of you.  He is going to jail because of his own AHish behavior (Driving under the influence which makes him the biggest AH).\n\nHe had a YEAR to perform his mandatory items from his plea bargain and didn't do it.  HIS responsibility.\n\nWhy would you even consider yourself to blame in any context when he didn't even bother paying you back previously.   This is NOT your friend.", "NTA but your soon-to-be ex could very well be. You are in the midst of a high conflict divorce, and this entire situation with your \u201cfriend\u201d screams that it\u2019s a setup. \nYou need to speak with your attorney immediately and tell them EVERYTHING you have discussed with this individual and about the money you have loaned them. \nDistance yourself from this person and do not have any further contact with them.  Do not discuss your divorce case or finances with anyone other than your attorney. \nA friend wouldn\u2019t burden you with this type of nonsense at a time like this, but flying monkeys absolutely will and they do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
