My mom and dad had me (16m) and when I was 6 my mom was expecting another baby, my little brother. She was 7 months into her pregnancy when she started to feel sick and went to the hospital. Some tests were carried out and it turned out my dad had been cheating on her and he passed along some STDs to her during her pregnancy. I remember my mom losing her shit on dad when she got home and I remember how devastated and scared she was. My brother was stillborn not long after and my mom never left the hospital. She bled really badly after the delivery. My mom kicked dad out the day she found out. My dad's family (his parents, three siblings and two SILs) were disgusted with him.\n\nWhen I was 10 my dad met and married his now wife Kate. From the time I met Kate she had this attitude of \"I don't know why everyone is mad at your dad, he treats me well and shows me so much respect\". She told me I should forgive my dad and not carry a grudge for my mom. She also told me she would get his family to stop treating him like a criminal. She never let the thing go. Over and over she told me to let it go. We clashed over that so often and my dad's family told her to go fuck herself with that attitude. She was like \"your dad has grown, he treats me like I deserve to be treated, he learned his lesson, he's a good man with me, he has someone he loves now and wants to have a happy marriage with\". This was an ongoing thing.\n\nThree years ago I realized my dad was cheating on Kate. He was saying he was working through Covid but I didn't buy that and neither did my family. Hen and Kate have three kids together (my half siblings, I know, but I don't care about them or see them as my family).\n\nKate found out about the cheating two months ago. She fell apart. Then last month she found out we all knew/suspected he was cheating. For a while she was trying to confide in me and I would just walk away from her or do something else and wouldn't listen. Then on Thanksgiving we were all together  with my family (dad's family) and she broke down even harder because nobody comforted her or stood up for her. That night she told me she thought I cared about and loved her and would be there and support her through this, because she's family, she's my stepmom, she's the mom of my siblings. I called her delusional and told her if she ever felt like I cared it's because it was what she wanted to think and not because I ever gave a shit about her. I told her she now knew what my mom went through only less severely. And that I guess she wasn't as special as she thought she was since he cheated on her too.\n\nShe started yelling and called me a monster and told me I won't ever see her kids again if I don't be nicer. I shrugged at her yelling because it won't upset me at all. She said I should have more loyalty to her and I had to hold myself back because I really wanted to call her delusional again.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700920465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183k8kf/aita_for_calling_my_stepmother_delusional_and/", "score": 2316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

HE DOES NOT OWE A GROWN ADULT ANYTHING!", ">but I hadn't seen in the comments that OP's mom died as a result too which obviously chances the perspective on the story.\n\nWell, what would you infer from the following clip from OP's actual original post?\n\n\n> My brother was stillborn not long after and my mom never left the hospital. She bled really badly after the delivery.\n\n\nThe inference is that she passed away from blood loss. \n\n\nAnd your statement that:\n\n>I think there is a version of this story were Kate is also a victim of the father's lies and perhaps did not know the full truth herself. Which again, would change how she interacts with her step-son and family. \n\n... does not matter one bit. Kate is the adult, and was denigrating OP's mother in front of him, a heck of a lot, and wouldn't let it all go. She told him to get over his grief for his own mother. He's a child, and she's been doing this since he was 10. \n\nI don't care if she was a victim of abuse by OP's father -- SHE is the adult and she shouldn't be transferring her emotions onto a child. If she's suffering, she gets therapy and gets out. That's it, really.", "Again, he is 16, he is a child. He is also being abused by this lady so yeah, he clapped back a little. Was that the most healthy/mature response he could\u2019ve had? Maybe not, but it\u2019s perfectly understandable. The stepmoms behavior is inexcusable and I can\u2019t figure out why you keep defending her so hard.", "So \u2026 you\u2019re comparing a 13 year old gossiping to an adult demanding emotional support from a child in the context of their adult marriage?", "I didn't find it emotionally abusive when I was being berated and shouted at and told how hateful I was and stupid and ugly I was for most of my childhood. It stopped when I moved out at 16, and years later I recognised it for what it was. I knew it wasn't right, obviously, but didn't frame it as such.\n\nBut by your logic, does that mean I wasn't emotionally abused until I was 16?", "Whether OP recognizes or feels like it's abuse is irrelevant, because guess what, IT'S STILL ABUSE.", "Making a child responsible for your emotions hurts other people. Minimizing actions that caused the death of your step-child\u2019s mother hurts other people. Not using whatever brain cells you have at your disposal doesn\u2019t make you a victim. All the signs were there for her. People who knew him for years, his own *family*, told her he was an asshole. She *signed up for this*. She\u2019s can\u2019t play the victim card now, when she had all the information she needed to steer clear of this cheating jackass. She just chose to ignore it.", "Could you imagine that conversation? \n\n13-yr-old OP: \"My dad's cheating on you.\"\n\nStepmother, who knows full well OP doesn't like her: \"YOU'RE LYING!\"", ">I feel like you have no empathy for Op, there is no way he is the asshole ever given the circumstances.\n\nI literally started my comment thread with \"NTA\" and I said everyone seems to be a victim of OP's dad so I don't agree that I have no empathy for OP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I agree though, lying is bad, but he didn't. He never told his step mum his dad wasn't cheating on her when she would confide in him, he never confirmed or told her that it isn't happening.\n\nThis depends on your interpretation of whether lying by omission is considered lying. Most times of this sub, people are crucified for failing to reveal someone is a cheater, sometime you aren't recommended to stay friends with a cheater. \n\nWhere I can have empathy for Stepmom in this story is for the fact that the entire side of her children's family knew about her husband infidelity and said nothing. OH also don't forget to mention the fact the same actions by OP literally already got two people killed over it previously but OP and his family still felt justified to keep that from her for years.", ">Three years ago I realized my dad was cheating on Kate. He was saying he was working through Covid but I didn't buy that and neither did my family. Hen and Kate have three kids together (my half siblings, I know, but I don't care about them or see them as my family).  \nKate found out about the cheating two months ago. She fell apart. Then last month she found out we all knew/suspected he was cheating. \n\nI copied the exact text from the post that mentions OP found out about the cheating three years ago and that everyone on his side of the family knew or suspected he was and no one bothered to tell Stepmom.", "OP is 16 now, not 13. The comparison I'm making is that he seemed mature enough to talk about it when it was gossip and used to make fun of step mom but suddenly is a child who needs to be shielded when he is called out about what he knew and how he used that information\n\nOh and also, the behavior OP is gossiping about is literally responsible for killing two people already but I guess not that big of a deal  the second time around when it impacts someone he doesn't care about.", "Your analogy doesn\u2019t make sense because OP would be the one calling you those hurtful things in the analogy, not the one being bullied.\n\nThats because OP knew and gossiped with his family about the cheating and didn\u2019t say anything to the person being cheated on. The kicker in the story is that by omission, OP was covering for the exact behavior that got his mom killed.", ">Most times of this sub, people are crucified for failing to reveal someone is a cheater, sometime you aren't recommended to stay friends with a cheater. \n\nCheating is bad, we all know this. However Op's step mum literally told his family and himself to forgive his father for cheating and killing his mum and brother. She said he has \"matured\", she was the one who put her beliefs on him being \"changed\". What happened with Op's mum is completely different to what is currently happening because SHE knew about his dad's history. SHE chose to stay with him regardless of that history. She ASSUMED that he has changed and become better. \n\nOp is not a warning sign, he was/is still young. He does not have to provide any sympathy or comfort for his step mum as she chose to have a life with a cheater. I cannot feel bad or empathy for her even though everyone kept it from her, this is because she saw the signs and ignored them. She practically knew that it was happening but she was in denial, she WAS being delusional. \n\nIf Op's step mum died of a STD during childbirth due to his shitter of a father, that is none of his concern because she chose a life with him. Whilst his mother didn't.", ">I literally started my comment thread with \"NTA\"\n\nI bet your apologies all end up with a 'but' in there too... \ud83d\ude44", "No, he did not know his dad was cheating, he suspected it. All based on not believing his dad was working through Covid. \n\nHe mentions no evidence of this, it\u2019s just a hunch.\n\nHe was 13 when that hunch started. \n\nIt is not his responsibility to insert himself into his father\u2019s new marriage and even if he did, his stepmom wouldn\u2019t have believed him."]}
