But seriously She knew this and had plenty of time to clean yet she's berating you for not cleaning fast enough? smh", "NTA.   \n\n\nI hate this narrative that people who work from home have free time all day that can be spent cleaning, as if we do not have to actually work. \n\nShe should not have asked the question if she did not want an honest answer.", "NTA, you just agreed with her assessment of her own behavior.", "NTA. She knew all week SHE was having guests over. SHE should have cleaned in preparation for her guests.

Leaving you just last minute things to do. This is all on her not you. This was her get together not yours.

Why is it solely your responsibility to clean the house for her friends to come over? Are you normal responsible for all the cleaning like this? If she knew she has plans for *her* friends to come over all week, why didn\u2019t she plan better and clean up after work throughout the week? Sounds like you\u2019re being taking advantage of dude.", "NTA. The oldest rule in the book is 'don't ask questions you don't want answers to'. She knew she was out of line and wanted you to clean up her feelings, too, apparently.", "NTA she asked and you gave an honest answer. It\u2019s on her to ask that in the first place. She sounds high maintenance", "NTA. you did YOUR best for HER friends. If she wanted it cleaner she should\u2019ve taken the time off work and/or told her friends to come later. Working from home is still an actual job. If she didn\u2019t come back to clean in between her breaks why should she expect it from you?", "NTA. It was her guests so she should be responsible for the preparations. However, if you guys knew you were having guests over a week in advance, why did y\u2019all wait until the day of to start cleaning?", "NTA. When my wife asks loaded questions, I always say \" I always agree with you. You know best\" Works most times", "NTA. She asked. She knew she was being shitty. She baited you into either lying to compliment her or truthfully telling her that her behavior is shitty and then being mad. \nHer behavior is concerning though. WFH is still work. She has no right to ask you to clean for her during your work breaks. You need to immediately put a stop to her viewing your work as less important than her work. I speak from experience owning my own business. Because i have the ability to have some flexibility i have some people around me who always expect me to be flexible. And unless you make a disgusting mess during your work days it was her responsibility to clean extra for her friends if that was her wish or at least to make sure you two were cleaning during the week to be prepared.", "NTA. Her friends, she could step up and do the work. She could have taken some time off even. Then she gets mad at you when you confirmed her own assessment. That makes her even more of a B. Don't ask questions, if you don't want an answer.", "Neither of us own it. We are renting together.\n\ntruthfully we haven't had a discussion regarding the division of labour, but we haven't had an argument about it either. I like to think we contribute almost equally to maintaining the house. She did say she would be responsible for the bathroom and her den. I am responsible for our bedroom and my den.", "More info: how often do you do any of the housework? \nWas this a \u201cbuild up\u201d of tasks you could have been managing over the week? \n\nBasically was she a \u201cb\u201d for a reason? Some women get frustrated when basics aren\u2019t shared, but then feel guilty for being mad, so they are self-deprecating.\n\nDoes she make \u201cefforts\u201d that you don\u2019t notice or appreciate?", "YTA for allowing her to walk all over her. The moment she started complaining you should have stopped what you were doing and walked out. She sounds completely ungrateful!", "NTA, but you should talk to her when she gets home about how you were doing her a favor, and it's her responsibility to clean up for her friends. It's not fair to berate somebody doing you a favor.", "NTA she\u2019s a total B. Her friends, her preparation. Who made you the maid/cook/cleaner?", "NTA. She could have cleaned throughout the week, but expected it of you. SHE was the ones with the friends coming over, so it\u2019s her responsibility to get the house how SHE wanted it. NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have asked a question she didn\u2019t want an answer to.", "You fell into a trap OP. Even if you agree she tricked you. \n\nSo really she\u2019s doubly the AH here and you didn\u2019t deserve to be treated poorly.", "NTA. She knows she was being a B. Why tf would she ask?", "NTA. She was definitely being a B", "NTA if she invites people over and she wants the house cleaned she should be doing the majority of the cleaning", "NTA the person who invites the guest(s) is the one responsible for cleaning the house and catering to the guest.", "NTA, show her this post if she disagrees", "NTA\n\n**She was the one hosting so she should clean, and besides she lives there so it's equally her responsibility on any other day to keep it clean.** More than that she spent the entire time being a miserable asshole lambasting you while having to do a basic house chore that should have been hers to begin with, and then had the gall to even ask what you might think she was behaving like.\n\nHonestly, this level of egocentric selfishness on her part is startling, and I'm wondering if this is a common occurence for you. Is she usually this immature and shitty towards you or is it just when she's entertaining friends? Also, does she normally assert control of the household by telling you to leave when she gets mad?", "NTA. But your gf is", "Honestly though, I\u2019d love to know if a \u201cwork from home\u201d person putting in a solid 8 or more.", "I do housework everyday usually. When my gf comes home after work, she is usually too tired to do anything. When my gf wakes up she usually grabs a bunch of clothes and tosses them on the couch or the chair or on the bed and I normally have to hang them all up. I've argued with her on this before and she promised not to do it again, but she does this cause she doesn't pick out the clothes she wants to wear the night before.\n\nYesterday I left the clothes where they were because I had a lot to do yesterday. At the end of the month it gets busier for me. \n\nNot that I am saying she doesn't contribute. She is in charge of cleaning her own space and the bathroom.", "Imagine expecting your wfh partner to do the bare essentials!", "Absolutely. We still have accountabilities and metrics we must meet. It is not sitting at home hanging out and enjoying the day. \n\nMy current role has much better work life balance, but in my previous salaried role, I was putting in an average of about 65 hours per week.", "yikes, just because people work from home doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t working, sure it can be easier to get chores done here and there with a wfh job but some still have you glued to your desk like mine does.", "I do about 9 and a half when I\u2019m wfh", "Key loggers, mouse trackers, webcams, screen mirroring, work output deadlines, all sorts of tracking when you're WFH.", "You mean starting cleaning as soon as they got off work? Those bare essentials?", "Imagine your partner skips lunch to make dinner and cleans right after work only for their partner to be mad that the partner didn't jeopardize their career to clean up for their friends.\n\nI'm so sick of people mocking work from home people like they're not doing anything important.", "Same."]}
