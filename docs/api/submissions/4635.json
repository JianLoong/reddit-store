You must be very strong to have gone through so much. Not everyone has experienced enough to grow and become strong as you have. I agree with u/imothro. Empathy is important in these situations, and many victims on this sub are very fragile. But I understand your viewpoint as well.", ">First off, this sub is called Am I the asshole. \n\nYes, it is. And framing victims of bullying as AHs if they don't do what you say is just another form of bullying.\n\n>Second off, are you just picking my comment or all the YWBTAH comments on this and every other thread on this sub?\n\nYou are the one in my inbox, so I am addressing you.\n\n>I am a victim of bullying myself- my entire fucking life as it happens- and if someone tells me that I will be an asshole for staying in a situation where I'm being bullied, I'd get it.\n\nThen you stand on a pile of privilege. Not everybody has the ability to escape their bullies. They may not have financial ability, they may be chronically ill, they may be trapped in a country where they don't have the rights to leave, there may be dependents involved, etc. \n\nYou don't really know anything about the specifics of OP's situation so insta-condemning them as the AH for not immediately having the ability to escape a bad situation is not something I'm ever going to agree with.", "Well I suggest you go check every single other YWBTAH comment and attack them too. Because it's a comment that A LOT of people make- not as bullying, as a way of saying get yourself out of the situation if you can, help yourself, don't put up with it anymore. It's not an insult.\nOh, and don't tell me I'm privileged to have escaped my bullies. Just as you said I don't know anything about OP and shouldn't judge, I suggest you do the same. As it happens I haven't escaped anything and I'm still dealing with it. As a result last year, I was diagnosed with PTSD, nearly got sectioned. Not that it's any of your business.", "Dude get over yourself.", "It's not an \"Attack\", it's a good point, connected to a kind and very empathetic request. And it wasn't about you personally, but about everyone who does this. You're just an example because your reply is right there. \n\nIf you feel attacked you know she probably has a point. Please take a deep breath and think about this again. It's not against you, just about a certain wording which is around a lot .", "It wasn't an attack, it was a polite request. I used the word please several times. Touch grass friend."]}
