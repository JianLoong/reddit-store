It's not an insult.\nOh, and don't tell me I'm privileged to have escaped my bullies. Just as you said I don't know anything about OP and shouldn't judge, I suggest you do the same. As it happens I haven't escaped anything and I'm still dealing with it. As a result last year, I was diagnosed with PTSD, nearly got sectioned. Not that it's any of your business.", "Dude get over yourself.", "It's not an \"Attack\", it's a good point, connected to a kind and very empathetic request. And it wasn't about you personally, but about everyone who does this. You're just an example because your reply is right there. \n\nIf you feel attacked you know she probably has a point. Please take a deep breath and think about this again. It's not against you, just about a certain wording which is around a lot .", "It wasn't an attack, it was a polite request. I used the word please several times. Touch grass friend.", "He is a sick person.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I lost my cat and best friend just over a week ago and it is so hard. \n\nYou are NTA at all. I would say more but I\u2019d likely get banned.", "NTA. \n\n>\"(bf) threw him out, he said it was an accident but I didn't believe him so pushed for the truth and he said it was because you don't show him any respect.\"\n\nIf there's one way to guarantee someone will never respect you, it's this. Even if you had done something genuinely disrespectful (which you didn't, by the way), it would never justify this reaction. This is just disgusting. I'm so sorry, OP. You have every right to be upset.", "NTA, only a special kind of asshole does something like that and deserves every name in the book, please be more cold towards that asshole and I hope you find a place you can call your own and get rid of him.", "NTA \n\nThis is one of the posts that hits people right in the heart. I think just about all of Reddit wants to choose violence right now on your behalf.  I\u2019m so sorry for what happened to you.  Your mom has allowed abusive behavior to become normalized to you both. Don\u2019t fall for that.  The man is a monster.  He doesn\u2019t understand respect, let alone deserve any.\n\nI found your original post simply by visiting your profile.", "NTA. He got off easy if you want my opinion because I would have done way worse to him than cursing him out", "NTA not a single thing would have kept me out of jail. I would have been beyond consolable. I am so incredibly sorry for your loss.", "NTA! \n\nYou should curse your mom up and down a wall too for not kicking him to the curb after doing that to you.", "NTA... he tried to injure you and was successful.  I'm sorry. Is it possible to move out ?", "NTA. \n\n>When I came home on Friday I asked mom where my dog was, and she started crying and said \"(bf) threw him out, he said it was an accident but I didn't believe him so pushed for the truth and he said it was because you don't show him any respect.\"\n\nYour mom let him do it and then tried to lie to you.  She cares more about her BF than her own child.  I would be done with her after this shit.", "NTA.  i'd be pants shitting angry.  F that dude, and your mother isn't much better.  this dude preys on people who are reliant on him and demand respect instead of being a decent person who deserves it.", "Sue him in civil court and move out NTA", "Tell your mom that since she chose his over you, when you move out, you will be going NC.\nYour mom is an AH and bf is and AH.\nI am so sorry about your dog. \nNTA", "NTA Why are you still spending weekends at home? Move out!", "NTA. I would've likely done far worse. Also really sorry about your dog, I know how much that hurts.", "Can you file charges for theft? I would not let this go and i would make that man's life hell until I died. NTA", "Can the impression of his paw and the ink print be replicated by the vet clinic that put him down? Also, I\u2019d sue him to hell and back.\n\nNTA.", "Why are you even asking?\n\nNta", "Nta. Fuck that guy.", "Can you contact the trash company? Idk how that works but maybe they'd know a roundabout location you could look?\n\nI'm so sorry about your doggo.", "NTA. If he\u2019d done that to me, I\u2019d have needed bail money.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like the bf has serious control issues. Getting mad for having to wait a minute to check something is outrages enough, but trying to punish you by throwing away the ashes? Disgusting. \n\nHave you checked the trash cans? Is it possible the ashes haven't been picked up and taken to the dump yet? \n\nIdk if you want to take the nuclear option as this would ruin your housing situation and likely your relationship with your mom, but you would be within your rights to take legal action.", "I just got goosebumps. What a extremely horrible thing for him to have done. Definitely NTA. This is so sad and i'm so sorry.", "NTA but I would full on silence treatment him and your mom and do the bare minimum while you try to move out - is it feasible for you to stay with the friend near work for a month or two and save to rent your own place? Or to rent for them more formally?", "Holy shit. How is OP not in jail on grievous boldly harm charges??? Because that\u2019s where I would be. \nFile a police report. And, OP, maybe go NC with \u201cmom\u201d. \nShe\u2019s no mother, she\u2019s trash.\nNTA.", "NTA I\u2019d have gone to jail for assault and I\u2019ve never been violent in my life. That\u2019s horrible. He deserved everything you said and more.", "NTA. I'm so sorry. No, you didn't go overboard. You actually showed more restraint than a lot of people would have. Again, sorry this happened to you.", "Oh wow. I would have lost my shit too!!\n\nNTA\n\nI'm sorry, I know how much losing a beloved pup can hurt. When my first love passed it felt like my heart was ripped out. I didn't realize how much I leaned on him until he was gone. It took my 2.5yrs before I was ready to get another one.", "NTA. I would go absofuckingtotaltasticnuclear if someone threw out my dogs ashes out of spite. That man deserves no respect and I\u2019d be cussing out mom too.", "You are NTA by any stretch of the imagination. I would have absolutely flipped my shit if I were you.\n\nThis man threw away a memorial of a beloved pet because you didn\u2019t get out of his way fast enough. He sounds honestly unhinged. Your mom is an AH if she takes his side or keeps dating this unfeeling monster", "NTA I'd be going NC with mom and boyf over that. He sounds like a right controlling, spiteful AH", "NTA - I would have made a little memorial set for him", "i\u2019m so sorry :( i hope you\u2019re doing okay and i hope your doggy is chasing squirrels or whatever he loved to do over the rainbow bridge", "NTA I would of cut my mom off for that. Tell her you'll treat her ashes the same way. But yeah NTA at all and you should leave soon. Get video evidence of how he acts also if it's legal", "First things first, **NTA** I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nMy chest hurts after reading this, what a disgusting, cruel act. \n\nI had a pet of 15 years put to sleep a few years back, I know how it feels but to hear what those two vile people did you as you were grieving, I\u2019ve never known a type of evil like it. I genuinely and physically feel for you.", "Your post has my blood BOILING. One, you are NTA. NTA so damn hard. Two, I would not be able to hold myself back physically if someone ever did this. Three, I\u2019m sorry but your mother is also TA here. \nShe knew that he threw them away and didn\u2019t press or immediately go looking for them. The fact that she just took what he said and didn\u2019t do a fucking thing about trying to find them, makes her an accomplice. \nScrew this guy. And your mom. I would be going NC and moving all my shit out.", "NTA. If anyone touched the momentos I have left of my dog I would be absolutely furious too.", "NTA.  If your mom doesn't leave him for this, she's just as bad as him.", "NTA. And not gonna lie, I\u2019d be plotting some epically petty revenge (favorite watch smashed with a hammer, favorite tshirt set on fire in the front yard) in your situation.", "NTA - your mom just accepts this? Garbage.", "OP, I am so, so sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is a type of grief that few things can compare to, and my heart goes out to you.\n\nYou are, unequivocally, NTA. Your mother\u2019s BF is lucky you just cursed him out, to be honest. My dog and cat are my babies, and if someone did something as unimaginably cruel as throwing out their ashes and mementos, I would legitimately be clawing at them like a hellcat, or at the very least throwing heavy stuff at their head. \n\nThat said, you need to move out. He is abusive, and your mum is unfortunately extremely toxic and is enabling his abuse towards you. Her failure to break up with him on the spot after what he did proves that she failed as a parent.", "NTA... my heart hurts for you.  I'm so sorry.  This man sounds super toxic and your mom is enabling him.  If you can leave, I would.  I also like others comments about taking him to civil court.  You may not get much but it'll upset and embarrass him, which he absolutely deserves.  I'm so sorry.", "NTA. I'm not suggesting anything OP, but what does this man love? Car, gaming console, overpriced watch? Asking for a friend", "So first off, NTA.\n\nThis didn't even need to be questioned. He threw out your old pup's ashes and belongings without permission. That's abuse, plain and simple.\n\nMy ex tried to take my goodest boy's urn/ashes and throw them in a box in the basement because she didn't like that I keep it on my nightstand; claimed it made her feel \"uncomfortable\" because I still say goodnight to him and pet his urn here and there. Details omitted, but he was my best friend for 16 years and literally saved my life. I attempted and wouldn't be here today if he hadn't casually walked in my room. I said to my ex in no kind terms that she can have an opinion on him when she's been in my life for 16 years and stopped me from going under.\n\nClearly she's not there when I come home anymore, but you know who is? My good boy, chilling on the nightstand.", "I would want revenge", "NTA. Ngl that would have very likely pushed me to an illegal act.", "people like him don't understand that respect is earned, and I imagine he's been an asshole his entire life and has never gotten respect from peers, so he has to demand it from younger people who are seemingly reliant on him.", "Gosh, I nearly burst into tears reading this post. My dog had to be put down 2 years ago and I received the same things as OP to remember them by. If someone threw them out as petty revenge and my mother basically sided with them....well I wouldn't have a mother anymore.", "Seriously. You can probably sue him and would win. That guy deserves it and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "You're an animal, how gross.", "So this supposed \u201cman\u201d handles conflict by throwing out the ashes of your service dog?", "I'm like you. I consider myself a patient and empathetic person, and I've deescalated some tricky situations. My husband would say I'm the kindest person he's known, and that I genuinely care for everyone because of it.\n\nI recently had to put down the feral cat I turned into the biggest, most demanding, lap cat there ever was. Working with her got me through becoming disabled. I recently picked up her ashes and other things like OP had done. \n\nI've been angry before, and I've calmly verbally eviscerated a few people. I'm a little worried that if I were OP, I'd discover the rage we are all capable of, and then turn it to 11.", "Yeah unfortunately I\u2019m betting his is abusive to the mom as well. My heart is breaking for OP, I would have lost my mind", "Yeah she is definately afraid of him. This is fucked. She needs to get away.", "I\u2019m feeling sick.  I have similar mementos of my pets.  The man is a monster and so is the mother for normalizing this to her child.", "I'm almost crying just from reading this. How can someone be so cruel and cold-blooded.", "I honestly missed the part about him being a service dog jesus fuck that makes it so much worse.", "I'm so sorry for your losses. Please take some time for yourself if this has upset you, it's a really heartbreaking post. I can DM pics of my pups being derps if it would help, just lmk.\n\nOur pets are always in our hearts, but yes, memorials mean so much. I hope OP gets some of it back if they can figure out what that [expletive] did with the package.", "I know, it's beyond reprehensible. Sending hugs, this one really got me as well."]}
