I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Are you even serious right now? Your mom's bf let him throw away her child's dog's ashes an collar and she didn't break up with him on the spot?\n\nNTA. Sue him in civil court for the theft of property. You won't get much money but at least it will be a moral victory.\n\nAnd please move out and stop talking to your mother. She's enabling this guy and does not actually care about you.\n\nSo sorry for the loss of your pup.", "NTA. Your mom is the asshole for keeping you in an abusive setting. He is the asshole for being abusive. Do you have anyone else you could stay with?", "NTA. So this supposed \u201cman\u201d handles conflict by throwing out the ashes of your service dog? What an absolute AH. I can\u2019t think while your mother stays with him.", "NTA \n\nYour mom\u2019s an AH for staying with him after that.", "NTA. Your mom has made it perfectly clear who her priority is, though, and my best advice is to get out of that home.", "Gonna be honest I would likely end up with an assault charge if someone did that with my pets ashes. NTA at ALL", "Still nicer than I would have been. NTA", "NTA.  Yeah OP probably said some mean stuff, but this little boy purposely trashed a memorial OP paid for.  At minimum OP is owed an apology and compensation, but I wouldn't hold my breath for either.  This from the person that whines about respect while also being the guy to run to his room like a petulant child for having to wait a minute to cook.\n\nI don't know OP's situation, but it's time to get out of that house.", "Hell no you didn't go overboard, dude is totally TA. I am so sorry for your loss, my wife and I lost our doggo earlier this year and I couldn't imagine not having his ashes and all that other stuff.\n\nIf it was me in your situation, I'd be looking for a cheap studio apartment in the town you work in and tell your mom you can't live with such a disrespectful human being (although I'd refer to him as a dicknose) and your mom should seriously reevaluate if thats the type of man she wants to associate with.", "NTA. As someone who recently lost their own pup, this makes me livid. Your mom's bf sounds like a walking red flag. \"I shouldnt have to wait for anything bc it's my house\"? What kinda bullshit is that?  Nah, he and your mom are both AHs bc he acted like a petulant child and she allowed his behavior.  He deserves a lot more than what you gave him.", "NTA. First off, the fact that he was mad because you told him to wait a minute so you didn't burn the food is ridiculous. But the bigger issue is the fact that he knowingly and purposefully threw out your dogs ashes that you paid for is unforgivable. More than the money issue its the fact that he used what he described as disrespect to justify his actions. There is NO justification for what he did. I'm unsure if you have a way to get them back but from your post I am assuming no. I am so sorry OP. He threw out the only physical reminder of your beloved pet and you are entirely justified for how you feel about it. Your mom saying you went overboard is wrong in my personal opinions. What he did was beyond rude. Again, I'm sorry.", "NTA.  Good lord. Who does that?  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I would also be furious. Your mom needs to see this guy is a giant baby who doesn\u2019t like it getting his way.  However you can\u2019t really point that out or she won\u2019t see it for herself and will protect him.  Mom is lonely and thinks she needs a man in her life to feel whole.

If he still has the ashes, then hopefully he will give them back to you in exchange for dropping the case. \n\nObviously what little money you would be awarded in small claims won\u2019t begin to cover your loss.  In the meantime, limit all conversation to text so you will have court evidence if it comes to that. No contact other than by text. \n\nI don\u2019t think your mom is an asshole, but her BFs actions should make her want to dump that man and find someone nicer. No amount of good looks or wealth is worth a BF treating my child like he treated you.", ">I told him I would in a minute as I was flipping the food and didn't want it to burn.

What a disgusting person.", "NTA\nHe maliciously deprived you of the reminders of a beloved pet because you squabbled. I would not trust this guy with anything.", "I would have went off on him to. You are NTA but calling you mom bf an AH is too nice and what I want to call him if get banned for. And BTW, you can tell him AH\u2019s don\u2019t deserve respect.", ">and she started crying and said \"(bf) threw him out, he said it was an accident but I didn't believe him so pushed for the truth and he said it was because you don't show him any respect.\"\n\nI feel a bit bad for your mother because it sounds like she may be in an abusive relationship.  \nThat being said she's an AH for staying with this guy.  \n\n\nNTA", "N T A if he wants respect maybe he should give it. Two way street.\n\nI would whip his a$$. I think just shouting at him showed restraint.", "NTA - is it possible to get the police involved? If so have proof like a recording of him saying he did it to hurt you. Tell your whole family what he did and what your mother allowed him to do.", "NTA and this is where you cut mom out. She made her choice, and it wasn't you.", "NTA, but your mom sure as hell is if she stays with him after this. If she doesn\u2019t see that this was WAYYYYY too far and that he needs to go, then I\u2019d cut her out too. They\u2019re both AHs but especially your mom if she allows someone to do this to her child.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with your mother???? OP, I am so, so sorry. That's just awful.", "I'd probably get locked up for assault.  Or I'd find something precious to him and grid of it.", "NTA 100%\n\nHoly crap, I cried reading this.  Your mom's bf is a HUGE AH.  Tell him if that box doesn't reappear in the next 60 seconds, he owes you the money it was to create and have those additional items of your dog or you're taking him to small claims court as that is damage to property.\n\nTo have at least a part of your dog: do you still have anything (dog brush, dog bed, etc) that has his hair on it? Wouldn't be the same but you could get the hair off it and keep it in a locket or something to still have a little part of him.\n\nAlso, I would move out ASAP.

To this day I kind of resent my mom for staying with him for six years of my childhood. I still suffer from ptsd and have to take medication for it. \nA few years ago my biological father died. I have his ashes. I took some and a part of a shirt that his loving wife of 30 years gave me and cut up a little piece of it. I took them to another state and mixed them together in a private ceremony of just me. \nLater my second stepfather asked what I did with the rest of his ashes. I told him that they were in the top of my closet. He said oh good, so close to your toilet so you can flush them. Wtf? Well both he and my mom had dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s.
