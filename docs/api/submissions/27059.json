Her and her daughter\u2019s jealousy issues are none of your concern. You could have been nicer when telling her to back off, but she needs to understand that you don\u2019t get to waltz in and change a family dynamic that you are a newcomer to. If they had been stepsiblings since they were 2 it would be a different story, but they only recently joined the family and are wanting to change the dynamics of how extended family interacts with their niece. Nope, that is not okay in the slightest.", "NTA. Elle just showed up to all this\u2026 so Lu has to suffer?", "Everyone telling you that your reaction was rude seems to be missing the part where she told you to \u201ctone it down\u201d. Fuck that. She could have reached out and asked you if you would mind doing a group activity with the girls, or just talked to you about how she feels sad her own child doesn\u2019t have anyone like you in her life, etc. But her solution was to take away from your niece to even things out. I would have had some more choice words before hanging up if someone stuck their nose in my business and spoke to me like that. NTA", "NTA\n\nHers kids jealousy of something beyond your control is none of her business. You shouldn\u2019t have to change anything of your relationship to your family to accommodate her.", "NTA I am an older lady and I simply cannot stress enough how important my aunties and uncles were to me. MANY years later, they are long gone. The memories we shared? Still wonderful.\nI am disgusted that your SIL would be upset a child has a loving family member.", "NTA - she\u2019s asking you to hurt your niece to make her kid feel better.", "NTA\n\n The entitlement here is crazy. \n\n>she doesn't have an aunts or uncles\n\nAnd? Why should Lu suffer for this?\n\nI'm tired of people marrying someone and expecting their kids to get the same bond the kids who were born in the family get.", "NTA. Your relationship with Lu should not have to suffer because Jane and Elle are envious. Perhaps you could include her every so often in a small outing or something if you decide that you want to do so, but that's not your burden to deal with if you decide against it.", "NTA \n\nYou are allowed to treat your neice how you want, and not have to modify your behavior with her.\n\nShe should be teaching her child that you can't always get what you want in life and how to deal appropriately with those feelings. \n\nAnd if she wants an uncle figure in her daughters life she should go out and find a volunteer", "Ah yes, the old make every child have less because one child can't handle not having everything for themselves. Classic bad parenting. \n\nWelcome to having a step-family! It means you don't get to have fun with your uncle anymore! You get fewer presents now! This absolutely will create a great bond and not make anyone at all resentful!\n\nNTA", "NTA - tell your SIL that she can entertain Elle herself.", "NTA. \n\nThe woman went about it unreasonably.\n\nAlthough, you should include Ella more, fostering sisterhood-y relationship between two girls should be the goal for the family.\n The change is already big as it is, for both of them.", "NTA", "NTA. Elle is old enough to know by now that sometimes other children have things she doesn't. If she doesn't know that by now that a parental failing and should be addressed by them.", "NTA. You already have an established relationship with LU which she enjoys. You shouldn't have to tone it down because Elle is jealous.\n\nThe person you should discuss this with is your brother and not his wife. He is the step parent of Elle and he needs to be comfortable with the overall family dynamics. He is trying to form a new family. I'm sure he will not want you to be kept apart from Lu, but he may also suggest you include Elle is a few family things. Her pushy mother should stay away and stop telling you what to do.", "NTA", "NTA. Being told to not be yourself with people because they are jealous or what not isn\u2019t your problem.\n\nBut, you should share the love.", "Regardless - you are a legend for having that type of relationship with  your niece. Nice.", "ESH. Her request was unreasonable, but your response was super rude.", "NTA - You have a long term loving and endearing relationship with Lu and Elle unfortunately does not with you.  As long as you are not ignoring Elle, being abusive to her, you should go on being the uncle Lu loves to be with and kid around.  Maybe the day will come where you may be the same to Elle.  Maybe not, you can't force this type of thing.  But you in no way tone down your bond with LU as that would be a form of rejection to her from you.  Jane is the AH here as she is trying to favor her daughter over Lu.  You should talk to your brother about this ASAP.  Boundaries must be set and adhered to.", "you are Not the asshole", "Elle has walked-up to her mother and said \"I feel emotionally neglected\" - but not in those words because that's hard without therapy. Drop that truth on Jane. Shutting-down your games doesn't help Elle at all, and it's mean to Lu. It might mean Elle stops talking about it, but that's the worst outcome of all.\n\nNTA, being the cool uncle is excellent, 5/5 would recommend.", "ESH \n\nShe went about it wrong. \n\nYou could easily have said you\u2019ll try to include Elle more.", "ESH\n\nSure, SIL's demand is little too much (she should be asking if you can make some effort with Elle as you are her stepuncle now, and not to tone it down with Lu), but you do realize that your brother has now two kids, right? His family is his new wife, daughter and stepdaughter and he should put them first... so depending on what your brother is like, it's possible that he could limit your time with Lu - I know I would have problem with family member who wouldn't see my children and stepchildren as equal.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have to change your relationship with your niece just because she has a stepsister now, but your reaction was beyond rude and it wouldn't kill you to have responded politely. Or even to offer to spend some time with Elle so that she can also have a bond with you (if you have the time to do so).", "Boy, SILs are rapidly replacing MILs as this site's primary villains.\n\nYours is really a prize, Miss Entitlement 2023. Why don't you start becoming unavailable whenever Elle and her mother are around. You can still play with Lu, just go NC on the other two.\n\nAnd if it causes a big rift in the family, good. Everyone should know how pushy this SIL is and what a mess she made.\n\nNTA", "YTA for handling it poorly.  Brother\u2019s new wife tells you she and her daughter are jealous of your relationship with your niece, the smart response is \u201cthanks for letting me know\u201d.  Then speak to your brother and let him address the problem within his household.  You do realize Jane likely contacted you without your brother\u2019s knowledge, right?  Because he supports your relationship with Lulu, right?  And so you should let him handle this.  Instead you played Jane\u2019s game, kept your brother out of the loop, escalated the problem and made a bigger mess.", "ESH. You couldn\u2019t have been civil or even nice? You had to go nuclear? She is pretty dumb for asking, but you are indeed an asshole.", "NTA. ThoughI do feel bad for the step-niece, who doesn\u2019t have a great Uncle like you in her life, you shouldn\u2019t have to tone down anything. You said the marriage is recent. Maybe in time you\u2019ll grow close with Elle. But you can\u2019t wipe away 10 years of closeness with your niece. But maybe as being the adult you you could try\nMaking Elle a feel a little special. I think the Mom is the AH for even asking that of you. There were better ways to for her and actually your brother, to approach this. Have they ever reached out about this previously?", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't know how much pull she has over your brother & if they'll simply stop your niece from seeing you.
