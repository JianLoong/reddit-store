Now, we have been dating a long time and we have had conversations about getting married, etc so this was not out of the blue. In fact, i have shown him several times the type of ring I like and would want when we got engaged.\n\nWell, he proposed with a ring that was the complete opposite of what I want. Think simple minimalist v/s very big and gaudy. I obviously said yes, but was a bit visibly taken aback by the ring. I tried to keep my composure since our families were present.\n\nThe next day, I asked him if we could get me another ring that was more to my liking since I would be the one wearing it. He said no, that the ring comes from his family and so he gets to decide how it looks. He also said that since his family is very comfortable (think one Europe trip a year type of rich) it shouldn't look like he skimped on the ring for his fiance. \n\nSomehow both our parents also caught wind of this issue and while my parents said we could compromise, his are saying that we have a standard to uphold and we cannot look poor in front of their peers just because I have simpler tastes.\n\nI've also proposed I get a simpler ring that I wear everyday in my normal routine, and wear his gaudy rocks whenever we visit his family. He has shut down that idea as well. I understand that it is just a piece of jewellery but I also don't know why we can't get another that I can wear in my normal routine.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA - clearing up some questions that were asked.\n\nThe ring is not a family heirloom. He bought it for me.\n\nOne Europe trip a year is not rich enough, but their Europe trip is generally a month or so long, with a bunch of luxury hotels, five star lunches, cruises, and a couple of shows or galas if their friends abroad invite them. I'm sorry I forgot to specify.\n\nI don't come from that background, my family is working class, if that helps.\n\n\nI have read all your responses, I'm sorry I couldn't respond to most of you. I made this post late at night because I couldn't sleep, and then activities of the day took over. I'm going to try and talk to him today evening once we are both home from work. Wish me luck!\n\nETA - a few of you are asking for pictures of the rings. \n\nWhile I cannot show you the actual ring for privacy reasons, I found one online that is quite similar to what he gave me. I also found a style that I prefer, and I have on occasion shown him this exact same picture while speaking of engagement rings I'd prefer.\n\n[the style/size of ring I prefer ](https://pin.it/2fM8Em2)\n\n[the ring he propsed with, not exactly the same but of a similar style/size](https://pin.it/2zLYTaN)\n\nI lot of you were also asking if he is always so \"controlling\". He's really not. This is the first time I have seen this side of him. He is the sweetest, most caring man I have ever met, which makes this incident all the more confusing for me.", "created_utc": 1696755020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172uc8s/aita_because_i_asked_my_fiance_to_get_me_another/", "score": 2807, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a family ring, so he \"gets to decide how it looks\" but it shouldn't look like he's \"skimped on the ring\"?\n\nWell, if its a family ring he's probably been given it by the family for free, no financial outlay required, except perhaps increased insurance premiums if it is that expensive.\n\nAnd you are asking for a different ring, not to have a jeweller re-work the family heirloom, so he never had a say in what the heirloom ring looks like in the first place. \n\nConsidering he had forewarning of your taste in rings and this is, it seems, the opposite of your choice, NTA. But it seems there is much more to this request and his response is clearly not simply about family tradition. \n\nI've a few questions here, no answers necessary, but worth considering or (for the first and second in particular) even asking of your fianc\u00e9:\n\n* Would there be an expectation you could continue to wear this engagement ring alongside your wedding ring once you are married, or would it be okay at that point to remove the engagement right and wear the wedding ring only?\n* Would the wedding ring be similarly big and ostentatious, regardless of your tastes? Is the wedding ring going to be from the same set as the engagement ring, even? Or will the wedding band be simpler, more in line with your tastes?\n* Is this going to be a long engagement? (Answer goes to how long you'd be wearing it, if there is no expectation you'd continue to wear it alongside your wedding band.)\n* Would it interfere with your every day work and hobby activities, and if it would interfere could you wear it on a necklace, and would he understand this? Or is he of the mentality that his fianc\u00e9e must wear the engagement ring on her finger at all times, regardless?", "NTA and not only are him and his family shallow but they\u2019re also fake as hell. What\u2019s the saying? *Money talks but wealth whispers.* Those with *real* wealth don\u2019t need the things they do and wear to scream for others attention. Often times the classiest, most upscale, most expensive things are understated. Someone with real wealth wouldn\u2019t be looking for a big, gaudy ring. They\u2019ve been looking for the best *quality* diamond in probably a custom designed setting.", "NTA. Consider this as a microcosm of your future relationship. He expects to be able to disregard your opinion and will continue to do so in the future. He is very likely to be a controlling partner. I strongly urge you to reconsider whether you actually want to marry this man.", "NTA. Your fiance probably wouldn't care because I don't have much money and I most likely never will but I think that displaying an object as only a token of wealth is incredibly tacky. A big ring is cool if it's for a big ring person but if it's not matching your style, taste or personality, then it's just going to look off. \n\nI would also be a bit worried that he seems more concerned about showing off his wealth instead of appreciating your needs and wants as a partner, when it comes to something that is supposed to symbolise your love and commitment to each other and is something that you have to wear everyday. Is this going to continue to be a problem when you make other decisions in the future?", "NTA... if he can't be respectful of your desires now, he probably won't be during your marriage. Is that truly the kind of life you want?", "There's two problems here: the ring he gave you isn't to your taste, and it's given for bad reasons. \n\nThe first part alone is a \"suck it up\" thing. \n\nThe latter might be a symptom of a serious problem in your relationship, or a single weird thing. Do you find that you are always the one giving in to his and his family's demand?

It\u2019s sounding like a \u201cyou need to wear this and behave like this to protect my family image\u201d situation.

And your fiancee not having your back about that tells me that his family is probably always going to have it theor way and probably will stick their noses in *your* buisiness when it comes to wedding, children, etc. Talk to your partner, make your boundaries clrear and retjink the relationship if he doesn't respect your boundaries, as he is right now clesrly showing you bring comfortable is worth less to him than his families opinion.", "ESH \n\nMarriage is about a shit ton of compromise.

Yes she told him she wanted a more simple ring, but he might have thought she was choosing conservatively due to price depending on the financial disparity of their families or is just hardwired to believe bigger is better. IDK when the request for a different ring happened or how OP approached it, but I can't imagine that asking for less gaudy ring like one she specifically showed him over breakfast the next morning would go over great with anyone.\n\nAlso major points deducted for parentally supervised proposal.", "That\u2019s 5 euro vacations to help ignore the red flags lol", "She has benefited from a wealthy boyfriend for five years and liked it just fine.

What kind of logic is that?", "I'm not going to lie here, I would pretty much bet every dollar I have that behind closed doors, his parents have made comments about your simple upbringing and about how their son needs to keep in mind that their family has a certain level of status so it's his responsibility to make sure if he's going to marry you that he brings you up to speed.\n\nI would assume that if you feel confident making a comment about this and discussing having simpler tastes and all of that that You're open about where you've come from and you're proud of your family connections and stuff even though your family may not have been affluent. Affluent people who care about what a friend of a friend will think when they see a simple ring on your hand while you're at the grocery store instead of a huge rock or whatever... Well, they care about a whole slew of other things. Probably things that if you were to acquiesce, you would be really uncomfortable.\n\nIf you've just gotten engaged and you're already having this kind of contention, I would expect that as you moved forward, you'd run into similar things wedding planning. You might want to have a small modest wedding with close family and friends only whereas his family would insist that because weddings are socially event in their social circles, not only do you have to have a certain dress code to make sure everybody dresses well enough, but you have to have it in a specific country club or other location, that it needs to be lavish and you need to be ready to invite hundreds of people because of how superficial affluent people treat weddings. Get ready to have similar arguments about what your dress looks like, the venue you use, the food you cater, they might even insist that you have a destination wedding over the course of several days that would require guests to invest a small chunk of change to attend, which wouldn't be a big deal if you we're running around with millions of dollars in the bank but for your family... I mean, imagine being urge to do a destination wedding that was so prohibitively expensive your own family members couldn't attend your wedding.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't move forward with this if this is how your marriage is kicking off. If your fiance doesn't have a particular rejecting attitude towards this superficial affluence social letter BS, you will be expected to assimilate into their family. They may be functioning on this assumption that to be human is to want money and to want money is to want a lot of money and the quickest way to earn said money is marrying into it so there's probably already been several discussions about whether or not you're just in it for the money as well as the assumption that you'll be required to do a prenup but one that their lawyers paid to construct and you'll be expected to not have it evaluated and amended by your own lawyer.", "NTA as you are willing to compromise to respect his reasoning for why he bought the ring he did.

He cares more about his family's opinion, and keeping up appearances than he does about your wants and feelings. Talk through it.

Just saying...", "You both are very shallow.", "NTA\nI refused a proposal once because of the ring. It sounds ridiculous at first, but just like you we had had the conversation many times and I had shown him several styles that I liked. What he got me was absolutely nothing like i had described. It was big and gaudy and I would never in a million years wear it. He was deeply offended that i didnt like the ring that he picked out and we had a big fight about it. The basic premise was nearly the same. I wanted something smaller and simpler. He wanted something big that he could show off to people. I realized that day that he cared more about what other people thought about him and us than what i thought. Between that and some other issues we had been trying to work through I decided to end the relationship. If he couldnt respect my opinion about something that was going to be on my finger for the rest of my life and would cause me unnecessary stress (I\u2019m an EMT, big rings are a problem and I wouldnt be able to wear it to work) then there was no way that he would listen to me about other issues as they arose.\n\nSo no.

We have a saying, that a gift should be accepted and not commented upon.\nSo.. Why should that matter that much to you? Why not accept it and wear it? Do you actually hate it or not like it? It sounds like you might have a problem with fancy stuff. I did and actually hated driving cars once I started cycling everywhere.\n\nBut that was my frustration. Now I cycle and drive when it's more efficient and I'm very happy about it. So why not wear it? A marriage is about compromises. Can't have it all your way. This is a red flag for him a bit also.", "He wants to put his \"brand\" on you.  Is he also letting his mask slip now that you have said yes?  Will more and more of this rigid behavior that discounts what you want begin to show?  Planning the wedding will give you a good idea.", "NTA. But stop calling things people can afford that you can\u2019t gaudy it makes you look bad, and also pretty disrespectful. Why not ask for a simple wedding band with a bigger/ nicer stone?
