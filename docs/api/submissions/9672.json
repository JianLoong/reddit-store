In the afternoon, same deal I wait till I hear the honk and I run outside and get him off the bus. \n\nOnce or twice the driver has had to honk a second time because we weren\u2019t ready at exactly 7:15.

Watch out a window, sit in your car so you can see, or stand outside at 7:13 and wait. Two minutes outside in the cold dressed appropriately won\u2019t hurt either of you. People are still sleeping at 715, or maybe just went to sleep bc of a night shift. You are very inconsiderate.

Imagine all the people who get their sleep interrupted thanks to you not getting your child ready early enough to be out the door to not get honked at. You did not mention the bus driver being late at all so you know what time to expect him to arrive which means you should be prepared. *The bus driver does NOT need to honk*.", "YTA.

You say waiting outside isn\u2019t an option because it\u2019s cold, but I\u2019m sure 30 seconds in the cold won\u2019t hurt anybody, the bus comes at the same time everyday. Don\u2019t be so selfish", "You make no attempt to watch and rush out but instead stay inside where it\u2019s cozy and wait for honking knowing your neighbors are in close proximity and work who knows what hours, yes yta.\nI wonder if a neighbor will complain to the school district now that they\u2019ve figured out who it is? I know our special needs busses honked too but it was occasional, only when a parent was actually accidentally, running late.", "Nobody's saying your kid can't take his \"special bus\". What they are saying is be responsible about it. Be ready for the bus inside or outside but DO NOT wait for the driver to have to honk. You are being rude to your neighbours for the twice daily noisy disruptions and to the driver for making them have to honk and wait for you to get your butt out the door. I have never heard of this in my life. I grew up in Canada and kids (with/without parents) waited outside for the bus. Your wife is right in being embarrassed because you're carrying on like an A.\n\nYTA", "Unfortunately YTA \nYou obviously know what time the bus will be there so you shouldn't need the bus driver to honk to go out and have your child get on the bus. You stated that you wait to hear the honk before rushing out the door and you live on the first floor. It won't hurt to wait outside for a minute or at least walk out when you know the driver will be pulling up. Even though you're not breaking any noise violations, it's enough to have other people complain. It's inconsiderate to the 39 other units. I know you mean well for your child but this is what's best for everyone.", "I have a masters in special education and I can say with certainty there is no disability that requires school bus horn honking. \n\nYou\u2019re just putting your convenience above that of 60+ neighbors sleep", "YTA - seems like it\u2019s convenient for you to not have to be as organised, so screw the rest. \n\nSome people work nights, can have health conditions etc that 7:15 is too early. You know when they\u2019re coming so wait inside the foyer or whatever if it\u2019s really that cold, but with some sense you won\u2019t be outside for more then a couple minutes. \n\nThere\u2019s no excuse in the afternoon either, get off your butt at 3:10 and walk down to meet them. You\u2019re the adult get up and ready for the pick up and be down waiting later.", "YTA. \n\nYou child\u2019s autism has absolutely nothing to do with you being a jerk to the people living in the 40 units around you. You know what time the bus gets there, have your kid ready and let your neighbors sleep.", " Just be ready on time?", "YTA\n\n   If I was being woken up by a horn at 7:15 every morning I would not be happy. You would be the neighbor that nobody likes.\n\n  If the bus comes at the same time everyday there is absolutely no reason for you to not be ready and waiting for it. Watch out the window for it or go sit in the car for a minute or two till it gets there. Or your kid should be dressed appropriately for the cold weather and can handle a minute or two outside unless its like negative temps. I grew up in Wisconsin and stood outside waiting for the school bus all the time and our bus had like a 15 minute window of time when it could show up. You can handle going outside at 7:14 for a 7:15 bus.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be ready for the bus, time to start a carpool. Otherwise, get him ready, and wait with him at the bus stop like everyone else!", "YTA. It doesn't matter if your son is disabled if if you're in a carpool and your co-worker is honking.\n\nIt's rude. It's waking the neighbors. It's entirely unnecessary.\n\nYou can wait outside for a few minutes. Even in the cold. Children all over New England and the Midwest walk to school, walk to bus stops, wait for school buses, etc. in the dead of winter.", "I live in the east and it's cold but we go out 5 min or more before the bus comes..... you can do that too... yta", "My first thought was you have to be k***ing kidding that you think it is ok to wake up everyone in your neighbourhood each morning.\n\nWhere in the world is it ok to do this?\n\nWhy don\u2019t you look out the window for the bus?\n\nOr have the driver text or call you?\n\nIf I were your neighbour I would be placing a noise complaint with the city, the strata etc.", "YTA. You chose to live in an apartment complex, which means you knew you'd have to essentially cohabitate on some level with your neighbors. What if your neighbor next to you like metal music at 7am and you had thin walls? Or they had a happy dog who yapped all day? No rules broken, but it's definitely a bad neighbor move and incredibly inconsiderate and selfish. I understand you cannot control your son's special needs, but you can definitely control how you handle them. Stop being lazy and rude, and find a different way that doesn't inconvenience the entire complex ffs.", "Yes YTA. The majority of families, special needs included, get their kids on the bus without disrupting the neighbors. Ask the driver to stop honking and get your sh*t together. Have your kid ready right before 7:15. Look out the door or window until they arrive, then take your kid out. Repeat in the afternoon for drop off. Needing a horn in the afternoon when you\u2019re not even scrambling to get the kid ready is pure laziness. It\u2019s your responsibility to be aware of the time and keep an eye out for the bus. I think you\u2019re being a bigger AH to the driver for being inconsiderate of their time as they\u2019re obviously more punctual than you. But yeah, I\u2019d be embarrassed if my neighbors had to hear my kid\u2019s school bus driver honk to get my attention 2x EVERY day.", "YTA. You're making your issue a problem for your complex. Ask the school to figure out a notification system, like GPS tracking, that doesn't affect your neighbours.", "YTA: You know the time for the bus. Go outside prior. Bundle up, if you have to. My son\u2019s bus doesn\u2019t honk. We\u2019re outside, when the bus gets there. Honking wakes people up. It\u2019s disruptive.", "YTA and wow so very entitled. Saying you have the right to get your child to school as if stopping the beeps will stop him getting to school \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23Just because your child is disabled doesn\u2019t make it ok to cause a nuisance to all your neighbours.", "YTA. You're causing all of your neighbors to be woken up at 7:15 am every day. Just bundle up and wait outside for a couple of minutes.", "You are totally the AH! I would be outraged at this system of \"honking\" for MANY reasons.  Absolute disrespecting ALL of your neighbours.  Very selfish excuses for poor behaviour.  How can you not understand how self centered and entitled this sounds?", "[deleted]", "Info: is there a reason you don\u2019t wait outside for the bus to arrive? This is the standard expectation of bus riders. Given special needs, I don\u2019t assume one way or another.", "YTA.  As a former school bus driver.. regular Ed and special Ed, this was a huge pet peeve.   No matter the weather.  This timing throws off the rest of the route having to wait for the parents to come outside Am or Pm. Either wait outside in your car and exit the vehicle as you see them he bus pull in or wait by the door and come out as the bus pull in.  I\u2019m sure the drive and your neighbors would be so thankful.", "I'd say slightly YTA. You can find other ways to be notified of the bus being outside such as getting the driver to shoot you a quick text message. It is also unfair to others to hear honking early in the morning.

I always wonder what happens after they read the reactions.", "YTA\n\nYou say it's too cold to wait outside - You dont' have to wait outside, just be a responsible adult and be outside by 7:15. A few minutes earlier won't kill either of you.\n\nSorry but 'special needs' child doesn't automatically give you a free pass for special treatment/to inconvenience others. You as the parent/adult in this situation should be teaching your child life lessons as well as setting boundaries and teaching them how to be responsible.", "YTA. I also have an autistic son and I live in Northern canada. I get it, but it\u2019s your responsibility to be on time, and waiting for the bus. It\u2019s not fair to your neighbours, and having an autistic child doesn\u2019t mean that *they* need to make accommodations for you.\n\nWhen we were kids, my mom used to load us into the car and park where the bus picked us up. Warm, and no need for honking. Maybe that\u2019s an option. The other option is to wait outside for a few minutes. Especially at drop off. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t wait at the bus stop.", "YTA. You're inconsiderate and obnoxious and using your son's diagnosis as a crutch for your poor behaviour.\nWait outside for the bus.", "YTA. \n\nActing like the people who are complaining about the inconsiderate noise are somehow denying your son the right to go to school is wild.", "I don't really understand how this is a daily thing. I mean, I have kids, I know how getting them ready in the mornings can go, and if it was something that happened occasionally because you were running late once in awhile, sure - that happens. I don't think it's fair to expect perfection from anyone at 7:15 in the morning, and sometimes things happen that you can't control. But *every day*? You know when the bus comes - I get not wanting to wait outside on the cold with your kid if you don't have to, but why aren't you ready and watching for the bus most mornings so you can go outside as soon as you see it, no honking needed? (And really, if both parents are home in the mornings, even if you are running late, one parent could watch for the bus and go tell them the kid will be out in a minute while the other finishes getting them ready, no need to honk.)\n\nAnd I *really* don't understand  why you're letting the bus honk for you when they drop your child off at home. That one probably isn't as big a deal for your neighbors - at least the ones who don't work overnight - but what are you doing that for? You're not getting a kid ready. There's nothing stopping you from waiting outside for a few minutes. Unless the drop-off time is really inconsistent, this shouldn't need to happen at all. \n\nMostly, horns honking outside that disturb people inside are just one of those things - annoying to people trying to sleep, but it's one of those things you just kind of have to deal with. And like I said, if this were happening once in a while, I'd say it was no big deal, life happens. But this isn't \"oh, yeah, I run late once in awhile, but mostly we try to be ready to go and watching for the bus.\". You're making a choice to let this go on every single day. YTA. There's no reason to do this.", "YTA.\n\nThe bus comes at the same time every day. Be ready early and looking out the window.  \n\nYour tone here even gives major AH vibes. Nobody is complaining about the actual bus, just the honking. Congrats on not breaking any technical noise rules; you seem to be arguing that you should be able to disrupt other\u2019s lives as much as you want because there is nothing that can do about it. \n\nYou are TAH; the people in your building have already told you this in writing and to your face. Hell, it sounds like even your wife thinks you\u2019re TAH.", "Omg. Yta. I can't even believe you're asking", "YTA. You are being incredibly selfish. \n\nNot everyone works a 9 to 5. You could be waking up someone getting much needed rest after a night shift\u2026you could be interrupting the sleep of someone who is sick\u2026you could be waking sleeping infants\u2026\n\nBut who cares about all those people, right? As long as your needs are met screw everyone else.", "Y are completely TA. You can be standing at the door at each of these times ready to walk out and bypass disturbing all your neighbors each day. Stating the fact that your son has autism has nothing to do with your inconsiderate and rude behavior. Get it together man.", "My son is autistic as well. When he was in school his bus did the same thing you described...minus the beeping. All you have to do is stand by the door until you see the bus. I don't know where you live but in our state, there is actually a law against a bus driver doing that (using a horn for anything but its intended purpose). \n\nI know your son is special and you have pressures that other parents do not. I really do feel you on that because I am in the same situation. However, your son's needs are not more important than your neighbors need to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "Seriously? Yes YTA and a very inconsiderate neighbor. Bus driver arrives about the same time every day, he doesn\u2019t need to honk to let you know he\u2019s there and you should put a stop to it. Your son going to school doesn\u2019t necessitate the bus honking, it just necessitates the bus. You are perfectly capable of getting to the bus that, again, arrives at the same time every day without being noisily notified. Not everyone is awake at 7:15, or even 3:15, not everyone is on your schedule. And with that, yes you likely are actually hurting people by causing them to get less sleep than they need or, you know, starting every morning super irritated by their inconsiderate neighbor and local bus driver.", "Ok, this has nothing to do with your kid and his autism or the special school. Quit trying to justify. If this were not a special needs school/bus that were honking you\u2019d still have the exact same issue and no way to justify.

Then, you and your child go wait beside the likely transparent, sliding door and when the bus pulls up silently, you and your child can exit the house into the freezing Midwest outdoors and get him on the bus! \n\nNow, you\u2019ve got your honking reminder, if you must, and you\u2019re not being a total dick to your many neighbors for the convenience of a single person in the entire complex.

Your son is neurotypical, but that does not give you the right to impact every one else that lives in your apartment simply because for a few months out of the year it\u2019s cold outside. That\u2019s a great time to teach your son the importance of dressing for the weather, and to wear a coat even if he doesn\u2019t always like it. You are using him as an excuse to not be uncomfortable for 2 minutes a day. \n\nI worked with autistic children for 3 years, ages 3-5 ,so exactly around your Son\u2019s age, and a super important rule to teach them that young is that they are expected to follow the rules just like everyone else. We taught them coping stills, learning stills, how to get dressed, how to brush their teeth, and yes, how to wait for the bus, get on the bus correctly by holding the handle, and how to be polite. If even nonverbal, high-need children with autism can learn via a strict routine (one that should involve being ready and at least out the door at 7:13), so can your son. You are holding back his potential and using his diagnosis as a crutch. That makes YTA even more so than just annoying your neighbors every single day.", "So can\u2019t you just watch out the window and then take your kid outside when you see the bus? \n\nThat\u2019s the system where I live for pickup. It\u2019s very cold and for young kids I agree you shouldn\u2019t wait outside. Also with young autistic kids it can be very difficult to wait outside, and potentially dangerous, especially if they are escape artists. \n\nAlso - don\u2019t ask child questions on Reddit. IME reddit has a very \u201cchildren as pets\u201d type attitude \n\nThat said, NTA, honking isn\u2019t going to kill anyone, and waiting outside may not be feasible.\n\nAsk in a parenting or parenting special needs group/ not on Reddit", "YTA.  If it\u2019s a short bus then it can wait silently by your sliding glass door until you realize it\u2019s there and get it together to get your kid to leave.  Or wake up earlier and be prepared. It\u2019s very rude to disturb your neighbours for a routine you do every weekday.  In my neighbourhood I\u2019ve noticed the smaller busses will just wait outside a kids house until the kid comes out.  They don\u2019t honk and you should go the same for your neighbours sake.", "I am sorry, but YTA. Our son was also on a special needs bus and we just waited by the window to see when it arrived. If you can't see out the window, get a camera or something.", "YTA.  So...the bus driver can't text you?", "YTA, and I have an autistic child. It\u2019s really inconsiderate to your neighbors", "YTA. I know people who have to haul ass at 6 am bc they gotta get up and feed the horses. If people can withstand manual barn work all day in those temperatures, I think your fragile little bones can handle a few minutes waiting for the bus.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not a service. The bus driver and your local residents are annoyed that they have to do this for you.\n\nCoincidentally, they recently cancelled busses but kept the schools open here for a day... a lot of people sucked it up and went outside.", "YTA and utterly clueless. You deserve pity as much as the frustration that is rightly being directed at you.", "My daughter is autistic and has a special bus too. We just watch and wait. No beeping is necessary. YTA.", "YTA. If the bus comes at 7:15 you should be ready at 7:10. You should be outside and waiting by 7:12. And don\u2019t give us that BS of \u201cI can\u2019t wait outside because it\u2019s cold\u201d. I live in Canada and waiting outside for a couple of minutes has never been a problem.", "YTA, but from this post it\u2019s clear you\u2019re going to ignore the judgement and keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "YTA. Why do you think it\u2019s ok for your behavior to wake up your neighbors?  Would you want someone honking their horn at 10pm every night waking up your kids?  Of course not. \n\nYou can avoid this situation, you just don\u2019t want to because it would be a minor inconvenience to you. Your responses to comments show that you\u2019re doubling down on being TH. Listen to your wife and fix this.", "YTA. I used to live in an apartment complex. Every morning the bus pulled up at 730. Not only was there honking, there was also a loud \u201cwe\u2019re cominnnnnnnng!\u201d in reply to the driver. DAILY.  This lady was so loud that I could hear it through my apartment walls. \n\nYou are definitely TA. Have your kid at the door waiting at 7:13, and walking out the door as soon as you see the bus approaching the building. \n\nThat\u2019s how the rest of us did it as kids. Your kid can do it too.  Thousands of kids wait for the bus every day; the weather is a non issue.", "Maybe I\u2019m missing something but how is his autism relevant here? Does he refuse to leave the house unless he hears the honk? I\u2019m confused as to why else being autistic would necessitate honking", "Y kinda TA. You know the exact time that the bus gets there. So, bundle yo ass up and be there. You don't need to stand out there for a long time. a minute or two. And ALWAYS have your son ready. It is not fair to the driver or the other kids further down the route to have to be late because of you.", "YTA. I\u2019m disabled and raised a disabled child who took a special bus. We also lived in a cold climate and are from the Caribbean. Not being used to the cold is not an excuse. The bus comes at roughly every time each morning. WAIT OUTSIDE. And tell the driver to stop honking. Give him your phone number. If you\u2019re that precious about your number (good grief), set up a google voice number.", "I'd recommend  having your child ready to go . You know the timing. And even if he is inside while you yourself wait outside for a few moments then kock or call for him that would be so easy.", "You don\u2019t have kids do you\u2026 let alone a child with a additional needs\u2026 \n\nI do, and while some may thrive on routine, most are time blind and don\u2019t always understand the concept of being ready on time. As parents we do our best but a lot can happen in the space of those two minutes where you\u2019re ready and waiting for the bus..", "YTA, it's 7:15 in the morning, plenty of people are still going to be sleeping.  It's on you to be ready.  Your son being disabled or not has nothing to do with it.  If you need to wait outside for five minutes do so, just dress appropriately.", "YTA\n\nThe bus should be coming at roughly the same time every morning and afternoon. You should head out 2-5 minutes before the bus arrives, especially since the bus stop is right by your door? Must be nice. As a child, I had to go walk to the bus stop, which was not near my front door, and then wait in the pouring rain or high heat (Florida in August/September is hot af) until the bus showed up. \n\nIf I was your neighbor I\u2019d be super pissed the bus was honking its horn that early in the morning. I sleep from 2am-10am (I work until pretty late) so my sleep would be getting interrupted 5 days a week.", "YTA  Get your kid dressed for the weather and outside for pickup time.  If he arrives the same time every day, you'll never be waiting for more than 5 minutes and neither of you will have time to freeze to death.  When my kids took a bus that picked them up in front of our house, the expectation was that they were out on the porch waiting when the bus pulled up.  Making the driver stop and honk for every child would have made the route longer than necessary for every other kid already on the bus.", "it can be relatively neutral. Disturbing your neighbours is not within your right to \u201ceducate\u201d your special needs child as you see fit. at the same time i understand your situation. maybe try finding a better solution like the bus driver calling your cell?", "YTA. Bus drivers typically won\u2019t honk at first command like that. So in other words you\u2019re definitely late EVERYDAY that the bus driver has no choice but to honk. You\u2019re a huge AH and your wife is right to be embarrassed because she\u2019s gonna have to deal with the situation(if you even \u201callow\u201d her I assume) because you\u2019re lazy.", "What if there are newborns in the building? Elder people?\n\nTry to be outside 2 mins before the bus arrives", "YTA. Do you have any people in the apartment complex that work third shift? Imagine trying to sleep after work and having to hear multiple honks twice a day while doing so. Just be ready and suck up the cold, or take your boy yourselves", "You\u2019re entitled and using your kid as proof\u2026YTA", "If the bus driver is honking, you are late for the bus. Also, you are making a bus load of students late for school. Every day. This will impact their time in school learning over the course of the school year.  YTA", "YTA. Wait by the door until you see him and then go right out. You are being so inconsiderate!", "NTA that is the procedure. My neighbor has a bus to pick him up and drop him off and they always honk. I noticed he was standing in front of the door, and the driver still honked. What is the big deal unless the driver honks a long time instead of a short beep?", "YTA. is there not another way? Is it the same driver every time? You could arrange that he sends you a WhatsApp or something. Or just be at your door at :15.", "Yta, the honking is inconsiderate and unnecessary.  You should b ready and waiting for the bus to arrive, then walk out when you see it pulling up.", "YTA. You know what time the bus arrives so you could be walking out the door at those times to stop the honking. Consider your neighbors may work hours where they are trying to sleep at those times. It doesn\u2019t have to be a noise violation to be inconsiderate.", "YTA- definitely not ok to honk a horn at 7:25 in the morning. Like others have said you need to have your child ready on time. But I thought of a solution that might work. Could you use the walk-in talkie feature on your phones so the driver can let you know they\u2019re there? Or get an actual cheap set of walkie-talkies to use? The range would be close enough that it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s feasible.", "Yup. Did that for years...", "agreed.  I lived this nightmare.  Apartment across the street on side where I lived... carpooling parents would drive up and honk every morning at a time when I was still asleep.  EVERY DAMN MORNING.  it was awful", "In the afternoon there is honking too!! That\u2019s just the parent being lazy, entitled and not wanting to be outside for a couple minutes.", "Imagine all those people whose sleep was interrupted because they couldn't get their kids ready in time to get out the door to avoid being honked. Didn't mention it so we'll know when it arrives. In other words, you should be prepared. Bus drivers do not need to honk their horns.", "The bus driver likely isn\u2019t honking to let them know they\u2019ve arrived but honking because they aren\u2019t outside yet and they need to hurry it up! They shouldn\u2019t have to honk to alert you to something that happens at the same time twice a day.", "Just imagine you work late and get woken up every morning because someones too lazy to bring their child outside on time.", "Not only that, but they specified they go out a sliding GLASS door, can't they just stand at the door when it gets close to time and watch for the bus?", "Parent thinks he's entitled. Especially since he has a \"disabled\" kid. Midwesterner here. In one school district, everyone K-12 rode the same bus no matter the disabilities. The bus would wait 2-3 minutes for long driveways but that was it and only because their timing was always off due to road conditions. The other district had separate ES & special needs going to a separate building. They required parents to be outside waiting with their kids 10 minutes before their scheduled pickup time. Same with drop off. If the bus driver doesn't see a parent the ES & SN busses would return those kids to the school. And they did not wait. If you weren't out there, they did not stop. \n\nGrow up dude, the world does not revolve around you or your kid. And you are doing your kid a disservice by not teaching them how to navigate a world that does not cater to them. From a parent of a kid on the spectrum. There is no reason kid can't be ready at 7:10 & you/them vigilantly watching for the bus to pull into the complex parking lot so you can run out the door to meet them. I wonder how long the bus waits before they honk...", "100%, 7.15 as well i would be so angry.", "He could also arrange for the driver to flick him a txt saying he is outside. \n\nOP, some people are still asleep at 7:15, and if they are light sleepers, that honking will wake them up. I don't know about you, but if my sleep was being disrupted nearly every day, I would be cranky. Show some consideration for your neighbor's and figure something else out.", "This is a pure guess based on my kid, but getting ready in the morning was nearly impossible and standing in roadway with a 4 year old who physically cannot cooperate? It\u2019s just not safe. Every thing has to be done in a very specific order to keep him safe. I was lucky enough to live close enough to not need the bus and have mine own transportation but I understand what OP going through. It\u2019s actually really hard. I cried every morning and that kid loved school he just couldn\u2019t let himself cooperate. This is also why I had strollers for my 4 year old.", "I don\u2019t even think the school need to do that. The bus arrives the same time each day. OP is just lazy.", "If the school or bus company will cooperate, you might be able to do this real cheap. If you have an Apple device, ask if they will let you put an AirTag on the bus and then it's trivial to set up a notification in the FindMy app when it comes within a preset distance of your house. Analogous systems exist for Android. If other parents would find something similar useful, club together and pay for an inexpensive tracker.", "OP is setting up the kid to think the world revolves around them. They\u2019re gonna be in for a rude shock.", "The afternoon honk is rude too. Could have night shift workers being woken, babies having their routine naps, sick people being woken, etc.", "3:15 is also disruptive. I work night shift, that\u2019s in the middle of my sleep. It\u2019s basically like if a car alarm or honking happens at 3:15am. Also people working from home, babies napping. All because the poster won\u2019t wait outside for a minute or two.", ">Drum party every night? Elephant running games at night?\n\nlol.  Tap dancing on the roof", "Where on earth do you live?", "I am neurodivergent and if a bus honked every day by my apartment, I would lose my damned mind. I can imagine being so upset I would either have to move or die.\n\nI've also worked nights most of my life, and being awakened every day by a bus honking would enrage me.", "A regular school bus will leave if you aren\u2019t there on time, this bus is waiting as evidenced by several honks instead of driving off. That is the accommodation. You know what time it gets there, watch out a window or wait outside for a minute of two. Having special transportation needs does not entitle you to disrupt your neighborhood.", "Lazy and entitled. 100% YTA, you are fine so that's it. No care for the neighbours whatsoever.", "Why can't you guys be ready and waiting inside the door?", "Are you positive? I have some experience with accommodations for special needs students and haven\u2019t ever heard that one. If it\u2019s not in writing, you should ask the bus driver directly", "That is not the point of the bus. The special needs bus is so that the special needs kids can have extra adult support and don't have to ride the bus with neurotypical kids. You still have to wait for the bus.", "So wait inside and watch out your sliding glass door for when the bus comes? You're 100% a self-absorbed, entitled asshole.", "No direct pickup and a bus with additional support is the service. Having the driver wait if you are late is the service. Honking is not the service. Especially the 3:15pm honking, that\u2019s only for your convenience and so you can avoid having to wait outside. That has nothing to do with your son being in the cold. 3:15pm is going to disrupt people who work night shift and day sleep as well as people working from home. Stop acting entitled. Show up on time and ask the driver to stop honking.", "Did they tell you that? You\u2019re not the first person to go from warm weather to  cold. Humans have been doing this for hundreds of years.

We were waiting at the end of the driveway each morning and afternoon. Oh and we live in Minnesota.", "Hey! It looks like you're not from America, but the honking horn is not a service. It's a warning. Most families that I work with with special needs have their kids ready and at the door. When they see the bus pulling up is when they go outside to avoid the honking. The honking is not a good thing. \n\nThe bus honks when it's there because they have to honk twice at a certain interval before they're allowed to leave. They do not honk immediately upon getting there, they're usually instructed to wait 1 minute before honking ( at least in my state for the dedicated buses ) - so you're probably not paying attention to when the bus actually gets there.", "I don\u2019t get why you think a sudden loud noise would somehow help an autistic person. As an autistic person, I find sudden loud noises extremely distressing. I know we\u2019re not a monolith and I\u2019m sure there are plenty of us that it wouldn\u2019t bother, but I don\u2019t get how it would help. Also a lot of us find the terms \u201ckiddo\u201d (when exclusively applied to disabled kids, if you use it for all kids that\u2019s fine, but most people don\u2019t) and \u201cspecial needs\u201d super condescending.", "Ahh, but you're forgetting that anyone who isn't up and being productive before 7:15am is lazy and deserves to be rudely woken\n/s to be safe", "I also work night shift. The afternoon honking would bother me even more. I usually sleep from around 9 or 10 am to 4 or 5pm, so 3:15 because a parent is too lazy and entitled to set their own alarm and wait a couple minutes outside would piss me off.", "What do you think they\u2019re going to do with it? They already know where you live, dude.", "But you're cool with putting your special needs child in their care while they operate a vehicle?  Got it.

Well some men seem to think lol but no women will. \nIf you can\u2019t handle being outside for 2 minutes then you need a new coat", "Does being from India stop you from getting ready on time?", "So in addition to teaching your child he doesn\u2019t need to be ready for commitments like being picked up, you\u2019re also teaching him that it\u2019s not important to dress for the weather you live in?\n\nHelp the kid out, he\u2019ll be that student who can\u2019t handle playing in the snow with everyone. I always felt bad for that one kid, never could last more than ten minutes outside during recess and missed out on the sledding and snowball fights.\n\nAlso YTA, you\u2019d be pissed at how random honking if it wasn\u2019t your kid\u2019s bus everyday.", "This just tells me that you haven't tried to get used to the temperature. I assure you, your body will adjust if you try.\n\nI'm from the Midwest. I was the kind of kid who just didn't wear a winter coat while waiting for the bus because it became too hot once I got on the bus for school. I was that tolerant of the cold.\n\nI went to work in Japan one summer as a young adult, and Japanese summers are brutal. Where we were, it wasn't uncommon for it to be 40 degrees Celsius with close to 100 percent humidity everyday.\n\nSeeking relief from that heat, my roommate and I kept our AC at 15 degrees Celsius. We loved it. Whenever our Japanese friends came over, they would complain about how brutally cold it was in our apartment.\n\nExcept as the summer went on, we gradually got used to the heat. Slowly, we set the AC to higher and higher temperatures. By the end of the summer we kept it at 25 degrees, and anything lower we found too cold.\n\nIt has nothing to do with where you're from.

Be a better neighbor and be ready and watch for the bus or drive your son yourself", "I agree that the morning routine could be adjusted so that OP can watch for the bus but this is rude and quite unnecessary.", "I forgot that important tid bit!!", "When I was a kid, if they weren\u2019t waiting at the bus stop to be picked up the driving just passed on by.", "\u201cSpecial needs\u201d is a problem regardless of what the child\u2019s disability is. Please watch this video by some people with Down Syndrome regarding use of that term.  https://youtu.be/kNMJaXuFuWQ", "A special needs school likely doesn\u2019t allow this and has extra rules about how long they\u2019ll wait or what accommodations they\u2019ll make", "It\u2019s very real! Babies sleep incredibly well in the fresh air. As long as they\u2019re sufficiently bundled up and protected from wind (and it\u2019s not like unreasonably cold out) they\u2019re perfectly fine sleeping outside.", "Also, the Midwest has 4 seasons.  School year starts in fall and ends in spring. Is OP not waiting outside for the bus in the warm weather,  too?", "Her kid is autistic. Clothing can be a sensory minefield and a lot of us don\u2019t ever desensitize.\n\nETA: temperature sensitivity can be a big thing for us too. Cold causes me literal pain.", "Yes, since they exit the sliding glass door, why can\u2019t parent be there watching and exit as soon as the bus arrives? That seems like a good plan.", "It'll depend on the school.\n\nMy Jr high and high school have a section for special needs kids. They're not allowed to honk, but the kids aid can go to the door and knock after so much time has passed. If it's an apartment and they can't enter or they don't know which apartment, they have to text the parent/guardian. If they get no response after so much time they're free to leave.\n\nOf course it may be different elsewhere, that's just how it is here.", "Wow that is wild but also super interesting. I love learning how other countries do day to day things.", "Seconded. I'm in an area that isn't quite as cold but -30 is absolutely common. Do you want to be out for a long time? No. Can you be out waiting for a bus? Yes, if you dress properly.\n\nOP YTA the bus driver is probably annoyed at you too.", "Some parts of the Midwest are parallel to the highest populated areas of Canada. Not saying she can\u2019t be ready, but Canada doesn\u2019t own cold.", "Southwest Minnesota and they used to make us wait outside the school until 8 in -60 wind chills (until the parents found out) but we had to wait for the bus outside really bundled up", "As the mom of a kid with autism I think this is not a blanket statement. Mine would meltdown in extreme heat or extreme cold very, very quickly. Regardless of dress. Wind alone scared her when she was little.", "You are made of waaaay stronger stuff than I am! I work at a school in the upper Midwest and I stayed home in protest last week when it was -28!", "Lol why would you tell such an obvious lie that can be easily disproven by googling. -40C and Canada schools close. Here in the US anything below -30F and schools shut down. \n\nThat weather is dangerous and vehicles might not even start.", "Hello, Southern neighbor.  I was one that lost my mind with the -20 degree temps because I'm just not made for that mess.  The kids still waited on the bus and managed without waking my neighbors though", "NTA. As a Mum with a child that attended a school for children with disability we had the same system for bus pick up/drop off as OP.  Nobody complained.  Sssh, what is wrong with people that can't deal with a horn honk twice a day?  This is the epitome of entitlement, get a life folks, your precious ears aren't going to fall off.", "I'm in Nebraska and we've had the coldest temps in the country several times in the last 2 years. We are often at arctic temps in Jan-Feb.", "I lived close to bus stops and I was in multiple school buses. They NEVER honked their horn and if they did is because they are late in picking up the kids or they are trying to manage around people that don\u2019t know how to drive.", "Do you have autism?", "Fuck -40 I can\u2019t even comprehend that lol", "If it's waking them up, they have a right to complain", "Why should the entire complex have to suffer for your child? That\u2019s great that your neighbors didn\u2019t complain, but this person\u2019s did. Perhaps they have children that are still sleeping or work an overnight shift. You are acting entitled because you have a child with special needs. It\u2019s the same time every day. The parent needs to be an adult.", "I think they\u2019re referring to Alaska more than anywhere, although I do agree with you.", "Well it's the \"ever\" that is wrong. Just factually wrong. More often, yes. But we get -40 and below often in Nebraska.", "ND here about twenty miles from the border\u2026 I feel your pain.", "My old friend is autistic but loud noises makes him have a breakdown to the point where he is unable to speak and try to physically stop the noise. (I know there is different types of autism)", "If it's waking them up then it's bad luck.   The horn honking isn't violating any noise restrictions and nobody is responsible for their neighbour's sleep schedule.", "I'm sorry that people's disabilities inconvenience others so much.", "It's been ROUGH, eh? I feel like ever since that polar vortex that came through that one year, it's just been nightmarish every winter. And it's always been cold before."]}
