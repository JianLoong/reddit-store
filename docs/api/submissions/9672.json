In the afternoon, same deal I wait till I hear the honk and I run outside and get him off the bus. \n\nOnce or twice the driver has had to honk a second time because we weren\u2019t ready at exactly 7:15. Also want to note we live in the Midwest and it\u2019s freezing cold most mornings so it\u2019s not an option to wait outside.\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten two notes on our front door complaining about the honking, and then today a neighbor said \u201cthat\u2019s been your fault this whole time? I\u2019ve been wondering who\u2019s behind the honking \u201c as he was walking by me this morning. \n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with this system. My son is autistic and needs this special bus, and we\u2019re not breaking any noise violations. I don\u2019t see what is unreasonable about this system we have set up but we\u2019ve had multiple complaints. My wife thinks we should ask the driver to stop honking and I have no intention of doing this. Our son is disabled and we are perfectly within our rights to get him to school as we see fit. A few honks twice a day isn\u2019t going to hurt anyone. \nShe is embarrassed about the complaints and thinks we should do something differently however, so I want to hear other points of view. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676094420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zdixs/aita_for_not_stopping_my_childs_bus_driver_from/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re on the first floor, wait by the door/peek out a window for when the bus is pulling up morning and afternoon.\n\nProblem solved.

Watch out a window, sit in your car so you can see, or stand outside at 7:13 and wait. Two minutes outside in the cold dressed appropriately won\u2019t hurt either of you. People are still sleeping at 715, or maybe just went to sleep bc of a night shift. You are very inconsiderate. Also depending on where you live it might be illegal for them to honk and if the neighbors report it, they can get fired. Horns are for emergencies only, even on special needs buses.", "YTA.

Stop using his condition as a shield for your infantile behavior.", "Is there a way for you to see the bus approaching?

And I had severe asthma, so It\u2019s definitely doable.  \n\nI\u2019d be pissed at honking 5 mornings a week too, so I\u2019m going with YTA.", "YTA. Imagine all the people who get their sleep interrupted thanks to you not getting your child ready early enough to be out the door to not get honked at. You did not mention the bus driver being late at all so you know what time to expect him to arrive which means you should be prepared. *The bus driver does NOT need to honk*.", "YTA.

You say waiting outside isn\u2019t an option because it\u2019s cold, but I\u2019m sure 30 seconds in the cold won\u2019t hurt anybody, the bus comes at the same time everyday. Don\u2019t be so selfish", "You make no attempt to watch and rush out but instead stay inside where it\u2019s cozy and wait for honking knowing your neighbors are in close proximity and work who knows what hours, yes yta.\nI wonder if a neighbor will complain to the school district now that they\u2019ve figured out who it is? I know our special needs busses honked too but it was occasional, only when a parent was actually accidentally, running late.", "Nobody's saying your kid can't take his \"special bus\". What they are saying is be responsible about it. Be ready for the bus inside or outside but DO NOT wait for the driver to have to honk. You are being rude to your neighbours for the twice daily noisy disruptions and to the driver for making them have to honk and wait for you to get your butt out the door. I have never heard of this in my life. I grew up in Canada and kids (with/without parents) waited outside for the bus. Your wife is right in being embarrassed because you're carrying on like an A.\n\nYTA", "Unfortunately YTA \nYou obviously know what time the bus will be there so you shouldn't need the bus driver to honk to go out and have your child get on the bus. You stated that you wait to hear the honk before rushing out the door and you live on the first floor. It won't hurt to wait outside for a minute or at least walk out when you know the driver will be pulling up. Even though you're not breaking any noise violations, it's enough to have other people complain. It's inconsiderate to the 39 other units. I know you mean well for your child but this is what's best for everyone.", "I have a masters in special education and I can say with certainty there is no disability that requires school bus horn honking. \n\nYou\u2019re just putting your convenience above that of 60+ neighbors sleep", "YTA - seems like it\u2019s convenient for you to not have to be as organised, so screw the rest. \n\nSome people work nights, can have health conditions etc that 7:15 is too early. You know when they\u2019re coming so wait inside the foyer or whatever if it\u2019s really that cold, but with some sense you won\u2019t be outside for more then a couple minutes. \n\nThere\u2019s no excuse in the afternoon either, get off your butt at 3:10 and walk down to meet them. You\u2019re the adult get up and ready for the pick up and be down waiting later.", "YTA. \n\nYou child\u2019s autism has absolutely nothing to do with you being a jerk to the people living in the 40 units around you. You know what time the bus gets there, have your kid ready and let your neighbors sleep.", " Just be ready on time?", "YTA\n\n   If I was being woken up by a horn at 7:15 every morning I would not be happy. You would be the neighbor that nobody likes.\n\n  If the bus comes at the same time everyday there is absolutely no reason for you to not be ready and waiting for it. Watch out the window for it or go sit in the car for a minute or two till it gets there. Or your kid should be dressed appropriately for the cold weather and can handle a minute or two outside unless its like negative temps. I grew up in Wisconsin and stood outside waiting for the school bus all the time and our bus had like a 15 minute window of time when it could show up. You can handle going outside at 7:14 for a 7:15 bus.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be ready for the bus, time to start a carpool. Otherwise, get him ready, and wait with him at the bus stop like everyone else!", "YTA. It doesn't matter if your son is disabled if if you're in a carpool and your co-worker is honking.\n\nIt's rude. It's waking the neighbors. It's entirely unnecessary.\n\nYou can wait outside for a few minutes. Even in the cold. Children all over New England and the Midwest walk to school, walk to bus stops, wait for school buses, etc. in the dead of winter.", "I live in the east and it's cold but we go out 5 min or more before the bus comes..... you can do that too... yta", "My first thought was you have to be k***ing kidding that you think it is ok to wake up everyone in your neighbourhood each morning.\n\nWhere in the world is it ok to do this?\n\nWhy don\u2019t you look out the window for the bus?\n\nOr have the driver text or call you?\n\nIf I were your neighbour I would be placing a noise complaint with the city, the strata etc.", "YTA. You chose to live in an apartment complex, which means you knew you'd have to essentially cohabitate on some level with your neighbors. What if your neighbor next to you like metal music at 7am and you had thin walls? Or they had a happy dog who yapped all day? No rules broken, but it's definitely a bad neighbor move and incredibly inconsiderate and selfish. I understand you cannot control your son's special needs, but you can definitely control how you handle them. Stop being lazy and rude, and find a different way that doesn't inconvenience the entire complex ffs.", "Yes YTA. The majority of families, special needs included, get their kids on the bus without disrupting the neighbors. Ask the driver to stop honking and get your sh*t together. Have your kid ready right before 7:15. Look out the door or window until they arrive, then take your kid out. Repeat in the afternoon for drop off. Needing a horn in the afternoon when you\u2019re not even scrambling to get the kid ready is pure laziness. It\u2019s your responsibility to be aware of the time and keep an eye out for the bus. I think you\u2019re being a bigger AH to the driver for being inconsiderate of their time as they\u2019re obviously more punctual than you. But yeah, I\u2019d be embarrassed if my neighbors had to hear my kid\u2019s school bus driver honk to get my attention 2x EVERY day.", "YTA. You're making your issue a problem for your complex. Ask the school to figure out a notification system, like GPS tracking, that doesn't affect your neighbours.", "YTA: You know the time for the bus. Go outside prior. Bundle up, if you have to. My son\u2019s bus doesn\u2019t honk. We\u2019re outside, when the bus gets there. Honking wakes people up. It\u2019s disruptive.", "YTA and wow so very entitled. Saying you have the right to get your child to school as if stopping the beeps will stop him getting to school \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23Just because your child is disabled doesn\u2019t make it ok to cause a nuisance to all your neighbours.", "YTA. You're causing all of your neighbors to be woken up at 7:15 am every day. Just bundle up and wait outside for a couple of minutes.", "You are totally the AH! I would be outraged at this system of \"honking\" for MANY reasons.  Absolute disrespecting ALL of your neighbours.  Very selfish excuses for poor behaviour.  How can you not understand how self centered and entitled this sounds?", "YTA\n\nBack in my day (like 15 years ago) the bus would drive off if you weren\u2019t at your spot at the given time.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no reason you can\u2019t be ready and walking out the door at 7:14. At the most you\u2019re waiting in the cold for a few minutes. \n\n3:15, absolutely no one cares if the driver honks. 7:15, you\u2019re being an AH.", "Info: is there a reason you don\u2019t wait outside for the bus to arrive? This is the standard expectation of bus riders. Given special needs, I don\u2019t assume one way or another.", "YTA.  As a former school bus driver.. regular Ed and special Ed, this was a huge pet peeve.   No matter the weather.  This timing throws off the rest of the route having to wait for the parents to come outside Am or Pm. Either wait outside in your car and exit the vehicle as you see them he bus pull in or wait by the door and come out as the bus pull in.  I\u2019m sure the drive and your neighbors would be so thankful.", "I'd say slightly YTA. You can find other ways to be notified of the bus being outside such as getting the driver to shoot you a quick text message. It is also unfair to others to hear honking early in the morning. If you can hear it from your room, they probably can too.", "YTA get ready sooner. Special needs or not, your the problem.", "You can\u2019t just put on some warm clothes and get out there 3-5 minutes before the bus?\u2026come on\u2026.", "YTA FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE IN THE COLD.

I always wonder what happens after they read the reactions.", "YTA\n\nYou say it's too cold to wait outside - You dont' have to wait outside, just be a responsible adult and be outside by 7:15. A few minutes earlier won't kill either of you.\n\nSorry but 'special needs' child doesn't automatically give you a free pass for special treatment/to inconvenience others. You as the parent/adult in this situation should be teaching your child life lessons as well as setting boundaries and teaching them how to be responsible.", "YTA. I also have an autistic son and I live in Northern canada. I get it, but it\u2019s your responsibility to be on time, and waiting for the bus. It\u2019s not fair to your neighbours, and having an autistic child doesn\u2019t mean that *they* need to make accommodations for you.\n\nWhen we were kids, my mom used to load us into the car and park where the bus picked us up. Warm, and no need for honking. Maybe that\u2019s an option. The other option is to wait outside for a few minutes. Especially at drop off. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t wait at the bus stop.", "YTA. You're inconsiderate and obnoxious and using your son's diagnosis as a crutch for your poor behaviour.\nWait outside for the bus.", "YTA. \n\nActing like the people who are complaining about the inconsiderate noise are somehow denying your son the right to go to school is wild.", "I don't really understand how this is a daily thing. I mean, I have kids, I know how getting them ready in the mornings can go, and if it was something that happened occasionally because you were running late once in awhile, sure - that happens. I don't think it's fair to expect perfection from anyone at 7:15 in the morning, and sometimes things happen that you can't control. But *every day*? You know when the bus comes - I get not wanting to wait outside on the cold with your kid if you don't have to, but why aren't you ready and watching for the bus most mornings so you can go outside as soon as you see it, no honking needed? (And really, if both parents are home in the mornings, even if you are running late, one parent could watch for the bus and go tell them the kid will be out in a minute while the other finishes getting them ready, no need to honk.)\n\nAnd I *really* don't understand  why you're letting the bus honk for you when they drop your child off at home. That one probably isn't as big a deal for your neighbors - at least the ones who don't work overnight - but what are you doing that for? You're not getting a kid ready. There's nothing stopping you from waiting outside for a few minutes. Unless the drop-off time is really inconsistent, this shouldn't need to happen at all. \n\nMostly, horns honking outside that disturb people inside are just one of those things - annoying to people trying to sleep, but it's one of those things you just kind of have to deal with. And like I said, if this were happening once in a while, I'd say it was no big deal, life happens. But this isn't \"oh, yeah, I run late once in awhile, but mostly we try to be ready to go and watching for the bus.\". You're making a choice to let this go on every single day. YTA. There's no reason to do this.", "YTA.\n\nThe bus comes at the same time every day. Be ready early and looking out the window.  \n\nYour tone here even gives major AH vibes. Nobody is complaining about the actual bus, just the honking. Congrats on not breaking any technical noise rules; you seem to be arguing that you should be able to disrupt other\u2019s lives as much as you want because there is nothing that can do about it. \n\nYou are TAH; the people in your building have already told you this in writing and to your face. Hell, it sounds like even your wife thinks you\u2019re TAH.", "Omg. Yta. I can't even believe you're asking", "YTA. You are being incredibly selfish. \n\nNot everyone works a 9 to 5. You could be waking up someone getting much needed rest after a night shift\u2026you could be interrupting the sleep of someone who is sick\u2026you could be waking sleeping infants\u2026\n\nBut who cares about all those people, right? As long as your needs are met screw everyone else.", "Y are completely TA. You can be standing at the door at each of these times ready to walk out and bypass disturbing all your neighbors each day. Stating the fact that your son has autism has nothing to do with your inconsiderate and rude behavior. Get it together man.", "My son is autistic as well. When he was in school his bus did the same thing you described...minus the beeping. All you have to do is stand by the door until you see the bus. I don't know where you live but in our state, there is actually a law against a bus driver doing that (using a horn for anything but its intended purpose). \n\nI know your son is special and you have pressures that other parents do not. I really do feel you on that because I am in the same situation. However, your son's needs are not more important than your neighbors need to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "Seriously? Yes YTA and a very inconsiderate neighbor. Bus driver arrives about the same time every day, he doesn\u2019t need to honk to let you know he\u2019s there and you should put a stop to it. Your son going to school doesn\u2019t necessitate the bus honking, it just necessitates the bus. You are perfectly capable of getting to the bus that, again, arrives at the same time every day without being noisily notified. Not everyone is awake at 7:15, or even 3:15, not everyone is on your schedule. And with that, yes you likely are actually hurting people by causing them to get less sleep than they need or, you know, starting every morning super irritated by their inconsiderate neighbor and local bus driver.", "Ok, this has nothing to do with your kid and his autism or the special school. Quit trying to justify. If this were not a special needs school/bus that were honking you\u2019d still have the exact same issue and no way to justify. I can\u2019t tell you how hard I\u2019m rolling my eyes. I\u2019m giving myself a headache. \n\nHow about this! YOU set your fancy phone to play a honking noise on weekdays at 7:14 AM. Then, you and your child go wait beside the likely transparent, sliding door and when the bus pulls up silently, you and your child can exit the house into the freezing Midwest outdoors and get him on the bus! \n\nNow, you\u2019ve got your honking reminder, if you must, and you\u2019re not being a total dick to your many neighbors for the convenience of a single person in the entire complex. You. \n\nI don\u2019t even think quiet hours are over where I live till 8. Some people work late/night shift. I wish one of them would blare a horn outside your bedroom when they come and go.

Why should the driver have to let OP know when he\u2019s there? All OP is doing is slowing the bus down and making sure any other disabled children have to spend that much more time on a bus, because he is incapable of being outside for 2 minutes a day.", "I work night shift. Granted I get off at 7 am so I'm not home until about 7:30, but I know in my area a lot of schools don't start until about 8 or 8:30 so the buses are slowly making their rounds when I'm starting to cozy up into bed. I would definately be pissed off having to hear bus honking every morning because someone's mom doesn't know how to be responsible", "Because iTs ToO cOlD", "I feel sorry for the bus driver. They probably hate having to pull up at OPs house cause they know there about to piss off an entire apartment complex.", "As a night shift worker, I would very much care if my entitled neighbor was causing honking outside my window while I am trying to sleep.", "Right? Major main character energy", "Horns are for signaling to ensure the safe operation of your vehicle, they aren't a doorbell or stress ball.\n\nETA Just Imagine using any other kind of noise maker like that, just some dude walking up to your house hitting gong wouldn't you be pissed?\n\nBut device designed to be loud enough to hear while your enclosed in a car during traffic with a radio on that's fine somehow?", "You need to get your kids up and ready earlier. You are inconsiderate to the driver and to the other students on the bus, as well as any neighbors you may have. They need to go back to not even stopping if there\u2019s no one at the bus stop.", "But you aren\u2019t uncomfortable giving the driver possession of your actual special needs child?", "Can you not watch out a window/door to see if it's there?", "Lmao did they really write in your EAP \"this particular kid doesn't have to wait outside\"?", "If you can\u2019t handle waiting 2 minutes outside or by a window, I have doubts about your abilities in raising a child, especially a disabled one. Good luck to your child, yikes.", "Honking the horn at that hour of the morning is unnecessary, especially in an apartment complex. I hope the other tenants wise up and complain to the bus company not OP. I guarantee the honking will stop.", "I live in the midwest and have a child that used to take the bus. Can confirm that it does sometimes suck waiting outside, especially if snowing of raining, but it's part of life here. What I'm wondering is, if they're on the ground floor, can't they see the bus pull up from their living room window?", "Scandinavian here, and I\u2019ve spent sooo much time waiting for busses outside during the winter. It\u2019s fine, a few minutes in the cold is not going to kill anyone. Hell, here in Scandinavia we often leave babies outside in their pram during nap time in winter.", "\"We've tried nothing but we're all out of ideas!\"", "Are you so untrusting of the bus driver that he can\u2019t have your phone number, but you let him drive your kid? \nYTA. \nYou sound very entitled  and you should think of others.", "HONKING??? sir. come on now we know that\u2019s not a service they provide. you need to come up with an alternative that doesn\u2019t wake up all your neighbors before one of them finds out who dispatches the bus and complains to them. because if they get enough complaints, they can and will stop picking up your son in your complex.", "My son\u2019s special education bus driver doesn\u2019t honk. They stay outside for less than a minute. If our front door doesn\u2019t open, they leave. They have specifically stated that they do not honk. We are required to provide the bus driver with our phone number, in case he comes home and no one is waiting for him. You chose to live where the winters are cold, bundle up for it. You\u2019re here now!", "Shit excuse mate", "YTA. \nIndian here living in a colder EU country.\n2 minutes is not long.\nIf you and your kids can't absolutely handle it, you shouldn't have moved to Midwest. Think about going back to India or relocating to warmer place rather than being an ass.", "Dude I\u2019m sorry but you can prepare for winter. I am from Canada and your argument does not hold up", "Yes you can. I live in Northern Canada. Lots of people here from India. Buy a coat.", "Put on another layer. Coat, gloves, hat. Simple.", "What the hell do you do when you have to walk to and from your car in the cold? Or do you just not go anywhere cause your precious body can\u2019t handle it?", "No one cares. You\u2019re not the first people to ever immigrate to a colder climate. It\u2019s your responsibility to adjust.", "The school doesn\u2019t require you to act like you aren\u2019t the center of the universe, so why do it?", "You said you're in an apartment complex. Can't you wait inside in the lobby of the building and run out when you see the bus?", "So you can\u2019t possibly look out that window? Get your child ready 5 minutes earlier? None of your excuses hold up.", "Apparently he just said he's from India and he and his kids can't stand the cold lol. So you weren't wrong. An entire apartment complex has to suffer cause dude refuses to be outside for more than a few seconds. I can't even.", "His son is probably in the cold longer just walking into the school after getting there than the time it would take to be outside waiting.", "My bus driver would straight up leave if I wasn't at the tip of the road waiting.  30 feet away? Damn, I didn't see you, better luck tomorow", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I was thinking. Could they not be standing in the doorway of the house, out of rain or whatever and then go out when the bus pulls up?", "I\u2019ve always wondered if the baby thing was a real thing!", "Or OP could just simply look out the window or be out the front at 7:13, waiting. Seems more like OP is lazy and constantly running late (hence the second honk) but because their child has special needs, they think the world revolves around them.", "This is one bus driver. I can tell you that none of my son\u2019s bus drivers have honked. They are instructed not to. Honking can be disruptive in a residential neighborhood.", "This doesn\u2019t have to do with accommodations to your son\u2019s needs, this has to do with your own scheduling OP.", "Um you are aware that some areas of the states are just as cold (and sometimes colder) than the neighboring Canadian provinces right? The US has very diverse climates, it literally depends on where you are as to wether or not intense cold is something you have to deal with for half the year.", "Thing is, we know it'll be cold each year, -40 is common (-50 and under a bit more rare) so we have the clothes/layering techniques down pat. We avoid the outdoors as much as possible, but life doesn't stop because of it. That cold if we need to be out we do a layer of thermal clothing (it's almost skin tight, but keeps your body heat in), a layer of polar fleece, then outerwear all rated for -40 or below. We leave as little skin exposed as possible (usually just around the eyes) as you can get frostbite in as little as 15 minutes and stay out of the wind as much as possible.  But if just going from house to warmed up car, car to shop/work/school and back, we don't wear as much (coat/boots/thinner driving gloves/hat or hood and maybe some thermals/leggings under jeans). Most people here don't hesitate to drop $400 on a good coat or pair of boots, they can literally save a limb/your life, but well taken care of they will last a decade or more.", "um are you aware that geographically the usa exists much lower than most of canada and it actually does get much colder in the north of canada than it does anywhere in the usa? not denying it gets cold in the usa as i said in my silly little internet joke i know it is not about who has it worse or whatever but factually it gets much much colder in parts of canada than it ever does anywhere in the usa."]}
