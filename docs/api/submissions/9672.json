In the afternoon, same deal I wait till I hear the honk and I run outside and get him off the bus. \n\nOnce or twice the driver has had to honk a second time because we weren\u2019t ready at exactly 7:15. Also want to note we live in the Midwest and it\u2019s freezing cold most mornings so it\u2019s not an option to wait outside.\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten two notes on our front door complaining about the honking, and then today a neighbor said \u201cthat\u2019s been your fault this whole time? I\u2019ve been wondering who\u2019s behind the honking \u201c as he was walking by me this morning. \n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with this system. My son is autistic and needs this special bus, and we\u2019re not breaking any noise violations.

You\u2019re on the first floor, wait by the door/peek out a window for when the bus is pulling up morning and afternoon.\n\nProblem solved.

Watch out a window, sit in your car so you can see, or stand outside at 7:13 and wait. Two minutes outside in the cold dressed appropriately won\u2019t hurt either of you. People are still sleeping at 715, or maybe just went to sleep bc of a night shift. You are very inconsiderate. Also depending on where you live it might be illegal for them to honk and if the neighbors report it, they can get fired. Horns are for emergencies only, even on special needs buses.", "YTA.

Stop using his condition as a shield for your infantile behavior.", "Is there a way for you to see the bus approaching?

This is about YOU not be sympathetic of your neigbours.", "I grew up in northern Michigan. I stood outside to wait for the bus for 10-20 minutes every morning.  And I had severe asthma, so It\u2019s definitely doable.  \n\nI\u2019d be pissed at honking 5 mornings a week too, so I\u2019m going with YTA.", "YTA. Imagine all the people who get their sleep interrupted thanks to you not getting your child ready early enough to be out the door to not get honked at. You did not mention the bus driver being late at all so you know what time to expect him to arrive which means you should be prepared. *The bus driver does NOT need to honk*.", "YTA.

You say waiting outside isn\u2019t an option because it\u2019s cold, but I\u2019m sure 30 seconds in the cold won\u2019t hurt anybody, the bus comes at the same time everyday. Don\u2019t be so selfish", "You make no attempt to watch and rush out but instead stay inside where it\u2019s cozy and wait for honking knowing your neighbors are in close proximity and work who knows what hours, yes yta.\nI wonder if a neighbor will complain to the school district now that they\u2019ve figured out who it is? I know our special needs busses honked too but it was occasional, only when a parent was actually accidentally, running late.", "Nobody's saying your kid can't take his \"special bus\". What they are saying is be responsible about it. Be ready for the bus inside or outside but DO NOT wait for the driver to have to honk. You are being rude to your neighbours for the twice daily noisy disruptions and to the driver for making them have to honk and wait for you to get your butt out the door. I have never heard of this in my life. I grew up in Canada and kids (with/without parents) waited outside for the bus. Your wife is right in being embarrassed because you're carrying on like an A.\n\nYTA", "Unfortunately YTA \nYou obviously know what time the bus will be there so you shouldn't need the bus driver to honk to go out and have your child get on the bus. You stated that you wait to hear the honk before rushing out the door and you live on the first floor. It won't hurt to wait outside for a minute or at least walk out when you know the driver will be pulling up. Even though you're not breaking any noise violations, it's enough to have other people complain. It's inconsiderate to the 39 other units. I know you mean well for your child but this is what's best for everyone.", "I have a masters in special education and I can say with certainty there is no disability that requires school bus horn honking. \n\nYou\u2019re just putting your convenience above that of 60+ neighbors sleep", "YTA - seems like it\u2019s convenient for you to not have to be as organised, so screw the rest. \n\nSome people work nights, can have health conditions etc that 7:15 is too early. You know when they\u2019re coming so wait inside the foyer or whatever if it\u2019s really that cold, but with some sense you won\u2019t be outside for more then a couple minutes. \n\nThere\u2019s no excuse in the afternoon either, get off your butt at 3:10 and walk down to meet them. You\u2019re the adult get up and ready for the pick up and be down waiting later.", "YTA. \n\nYou child\u2019s autism has absolutely nothing to do with you being a jerk to the people living in the 40 units around you. You know what time the bus gets there, have your kid ready and let your neighbors sleep.", " Just be ready on time?", "YTA\n\n   If I was being woken up by a horn at 7:15 every morning I would not be happy. You would be the neighbor that nobody likes.\n\n  If the bus comes at the same time everyday there is absolutely no reason for you to not be ready and waiting for it. Watch out the window for it or go sit in the car for a minute or two till it gets there. Or your kid should be dressed appropriately for the cold weather and can handle a minute or two outside unless its like negative temps. I grew up in Wisconsin and stood outside waiting for the school bus all the time and our bus had like a 15 minute window of time when it could show up. You can handle going outside at 7:14 for a 7:15 bus.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be ready for the bus, time to start a carpool. Otherwise, get him ready, and wait with him at the bus stop like everyone else!", "YTA. It doesn't matter if your son is disabled if if you're in a carpool and your co-worker is honking.\n\nIt's rude. It's waking the neighbors. It's entirely unnecessary.\n\nYou can wait outside for a few minutes. Even in the cold. Children all over New England and the Midwest walk to school, walk to bus stops, wait for school buses, etc. in the dead of winter.", "I live in the east and it's cold but we go out 5 min or more before the bus comes..... you can do that too... yta", "My first thought was you have to be k***ing kidding that you think it is ok to wake up everyone in your neighbourhood each morning.\n\nWhere in the world is it ok to do this?\n\nWhy don\u2019t you look out the window for the bus?\n\nOr have the driver text or call you?\n\nIf I were your neighbour I would be placing a noise complaint with the city, the strata etc.", "YTA. You chose to live in an apartment complex, which means you knew you'd have to essentially cohabitate on some level with your neighbors. What if your neighbor next to you like metal music at 7am and you had thin walls? Or they had a happy dog who yapped all day? No rules broken, but it's definitely a bad neighbor move and incredibly inconsiderate and selfish. I understand you cannot control your son's special needs, but you can definitely control how you handle them. Stop being lazy and rude, and find a different way that doesn't inconvenience the entire complex ffs.", "Yes YTA. The majority of families, special needs included, get their kids on the bus without disrupting the neighbors. Ask the driver to stop honking and get your sh*t together. Have your kid ready right before 7:15. Look out the door or window until they arrive, then take your kid out. Repeat in the afternoon for drop off. Needing a horn in the afternoon when you\u2019re not even scrambling to get the kid ready is pure laziness. It\u2019s your responsibility to be aware of the time and keep an eye out for the bus. I think you\u2019re being a bigger AH to the driver for being inconsiderate of their time as they\u2019re obviously more punctual than you. But yeah, I\u2019d be embarrassed if my neighbors had to hear my kid\u2019s school bus driver honk to get my attention 2x EVERY day.", "YTA. You're making your issue a problem for your complex. Ask the school to figure out a notification system, like GPS tracking, that doesn't affect your neighbours.", "YTA: You know the time for the bus. Go outside prior. Bundle up, if you have to. My son\u2019s bus doesn\u2019t honk. We\u2019re outside, when the bus gets there. Honking wakes people up. It\u2019s disruptive.", "YTA and wow so very entitled. Saying you have the right to get your child to school as if stopping the beeps will stop him getting to school \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23Just because your child is disabled doesn\u2019t make it ok to cause a nuisance to all your neighbours.", "YTA. You're causing all of your neighbors to be woken up at 7:15 am every day. Just bundle up and wait outside for a couple of minutes.", "You are totally the AH! I would be outraged at this system of \"honking\" for MANY reasons.  Absolute disrespecting ALL of your neighbours.  Very selfish excuses for poor behaviour.  How can you not understand how self centered and entitled this sounds?", "YTA\n\nBack in my day (like 15 years ago) the bus would drive off if you weren\u2019t at your spot at the given time.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no reason you can\u2019t be ready and walking out the door at 7:14. At the most you\u2019re waiting in the cold for a few minutes. \n\n3:15, absolutely no one cares if the driver honks. 7:15, you\u2019re being an AH.", "Info: is there a reason you don\u2019t wait outside for the bus to arrive? This is the standard expectation of bus riders. Given special needs, I don\u2019t assume one way or another.", "YTA.  As a former school bus driver.. regular Ed and special Ed, this was a huge pet peeve.   No matter the weather.  This timing throws off the rest of the route having to wait for the parents to come outside Am or Pm. Either wait outside in your car and exit the vehicle as you see them he bus pull in or wait by the door and come out as the bus pull in.  I\u2019m sure the drive and your neighbors would be so thankful.", "I'd say slightly YTA. You can find other ways to be notified of the bus being outside such as getting the driver to shoot you a quick text message. It is also unfair to others to hear honking early in the morning. If you can hear it from your room, they probably can too.", "YTA get ready sooner. Special needs or not, your the problem.", "You can\u2019t just put on some warm clothes and get out there 3-5 minutes before the bus?\u2026come on\u2026.", "YTA FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE IN THE COLD.

I always wonder what happens after they read the reactions.", "YTA\n\nYou say it's too cold to wait outside - You dont' have to wait outside, just be a responsible adult and be outside by 7:15. A few minutes earlier won't kill either of you.\n\nSorry but 'special needs' child doesn't automatically give you a free pass for special treatment/to inconvenience others. You as the parent/adult in this situation should be teaching your child life lessons as well as setting boundaries and teaching them how to be responsible.", "YTA. I also have an autistic son and I live in Northern canada. I get it, but it\u2019s your responsibility to be on time, and waiting for the bus. It\u2019s not fair to your neighbours, and having an autistic child doesn\u2019t mean that *they* need to make accommodations for you.\n\nWhen we were kids, my mom used to load us into the car and park where the bus picked us up. Warm, and no need for honking. Maybe that\u2019s an option. The other option is to wait outside for a few minutes. Especially at drop off. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t wait at the bus stop.", "YTA. You're inconsiderate and obnoxious and using your son's diagnosis as a crutch for your poor behaviour.\nWait outside for the bus.", "YTA. \n\nActing like the people who are complaining about the inconsiderate noise are somehow denying your son the right to go to school is wild.", "I don't really understand how this is a daily thing. I mean, I have kids, I know how getting them ready in the mornings can go, and if it was something that happened occasionally because you were running late once in awhile, sure - that happens. I don't think it's fair to expect perfection from anyone at 7:15 in the morning, and sometimes things happen that you can't control. But *every day*? You know when the bus comes - I get not wanting to wait outside on the cold with your kid if you don't have to, but why aren't you ready and watching for the bus most mornings so you can go outside as soon as you see it, no honking needed? (And really, if both parents are home in the mornings, even if you are running late, one parent could watch for the bus and go tell them the kid will be out in a minute while the other finishes getting them ready, no need to honk.)\n\nAnd I *really* don't understand  why you're letting the bus honk for you when they drop your child off at home. That one probably isn't as big a deal for your neighbors - at least the ones who don't work overnight - but what are you doing that for? You're not getting a kid ready. There's nothing stopping you from waiting outside for a few minutes. Unless the drop-off time is really inconsistent, this shouldn't need to happen at all. \n\nMostly, horns honking outside that disturb people inside are just one of those things - annoying to people trying to sleep, but it's one of those things you just kind of have to deal with. And like I said, if this were happening once in a while, I'd say it was no big deal, life happens. But this isn't \"oh, yeah, I run late once in awhile, but mostly we try to be ready to go and watching for the bus.\". You're making a choice to let this go on every single day. YTA. There's no reason to do this.", "YTA.\n\nThe bus comes at the same time every day. Be ready early and looking out the window.  \n\nYour tone here even gives major AH vibes. Nobody is complaining about the actual bus, just the honking. Congrats on not breaking any technical noise rules; you seem to be arguing that you should be able to disrupt other\u2019s lives as much as you want because there is nothing that can do about it. \n\nYou are TAH; the people in your building have already told you this in writing and to your face. Hell, it sounds like even your wife thinks you\u2019re TAH.", "Omg. Yta. I can't even believe you're asking", "YTA. You are being incredibly selfish. \n\nNot everyone works a 9 to 5. You could be waking up someone getting much needed rest after a night shift\u2026you could be interrupting the sleep of someone who is sick\u2026you could be waking sleeping infants\u2026\n\nBut who cares about all those people, right? As long as your needs are met screw everyone else.", "Y are completely TA. You can be standing at the door at each of these times ready to walk out and bypass disturbing all your neighbors each day. Stating the fact that your son has autism has nothing to do with your inconsiderate and rude behavior. Get it together man.", "My son is autistic as well. When he was in school his bus did the same thing you described...minus the beeping. All you have to do is stand by the door until you see the bus. I don't know where you live but in our state, there is actually a law against a bus driver doing that (using a horn for anything but its intended purpose). \n\nI know your son is special and you have pressures that other parents do not. I really do feel you on that because I am in the same situation. However, your son's needs are not more important than your neighbors need to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "Seriously? Yes YTA and a very inconsiderate neighbor. Bus driver arrives about the same time every day, he doesn\u2019t need to honk to let you know he\u2019s there and you should put a stop to it. Your son going to school doesn\u2019t necessitate the bus honking, it just necessitates the bus. You are perfectly capable of getting to the bus that, again, arrives at the same time every day without being noisily notified. Not everyone is awake at 7:15, or even 3:15, not everyone is on your schedule. And with that, yes you likely are actually hurting people by causing them to get less sleep than they need or, you know, starting every morning super irritated by their inconsiderate neighbor and local bus driver.", "Ok, this has nothing to do with your kid and his autism or the special school. Quit trying to justify. If this were not a special needs school/bus that were honking you\u2019d still have the exact same issue and no way to justify. I can\u2019t tell you how hard I\u2019m rolling my eyes. I\u2019m giving myself a headache. \n\nHow about this! YOU set your fancy phone to play a honking noise on weekdays at 7:14 AM. Then, you and your child go wait beside the likely transparent, sliding door and when the bus pulls up silently, you and your child can exit the house into the freezing Midwest outdoors and get him on the bus! \n\nNow, you\u2019ve got your honking reminder, if you must, and you\u2019re not being a total dick to your many neighbors for the convenience of a single person in the entire complex. You. \n\nI don\u2019t even think quiet hours are over where I live till 8. Some people work late/night shift. I wish one of them would blare a horn outside your bedroom when they come and go.

It's a bus most people wait on the bus. You live in the Midwest so do millions of other people and they seem to be outside with proper coats just fine. Just wear a jacket, hat and gloves. You are waking up your neighbors daily I would be pissed at you too this is really an AH move.", "YTA.   \nSeriously, how much does it inconvenience you to go outside and wait for the bus?

Sometimes our driver is early, sometimes later, but we know that he usually arrives between 8:05-8:25am, so we are always ready to go by 8am. \n\nHe\u2019s NEVER had to honk for us.

You are being unnecessary disruptive. If its really that cold, wait at the window  a couple minutes before 7.15 and go out when it arrives. Its not rocket science.

There's no good reason to ask for special treatment just because a few neighbors have their undies in a twist.\n\nIt can't hurt to ask if there are other options available, but if the driver says that's the system, then that's the system.", "Nta I was q light sleeper. Then I moved next to a train yard, a main emergency route and finally I've lu ked out and now live next to noisy neighbor's!

You could maybe get the driver to text you instead of honking? Or set up some other signal that'd be more respectful of your neighbors? But I don't think it's that big a deal. Cars honking is a normal thing.", "No answer. The bus driver has too kind a heart to want to leave a kid behind. Autisms too hard a disability to understand. No not everyone wants to understand it.

For the past 4 years I've had this happen to me and the kids are ALWAYS late and the bus driver has to honk 3 or 4 times. Kids go to school, buses come pick the up, it happens. Far less annoying and bothersome, imo, than the dogs that bark throughout the day. Yeah, maybe run out as the bus driver runs up and wave then go get your son so they don't honk, but I don't think you're an AH.", "NTA this is the norm where I come from.", "I didn't understand this either. No one is complaining about the bus or the child. They are complaining about the honking which is not needed to get ops son on the bus. \nWhat if there's a neurodivergent person living in the building that gets stressed out by the honking every morning?

Unfortunately, YTA. \n\nThe system works for you because you\u2019re awake. The audio stimulus is likely even something that may help your kiddo given his special needs. \n\nHOWEVER, you live in an apartment complex, so it\u2019s not as much about you/your family as the 19 other units in the complex too. They may work second or third shift, & you\u2019re interrupting their sleep. They may have special needs kids and the honk that helps your kid sets off another kid. \n\nI would suggest, to be helpful, that maybe set an internal alarm clock for 7:10am & normalize that into your routine. At 7:10a we go to the window and watch for the bus. When we see the bus, we open the door. no honk is needed and your kiddo still gets the auditory cues.", "and just to add: unless the american midwest is suddenly the north pole, it most definitely does not get so cold that you can\u2019t stand outside for 2-3 minutes to wait for the bus.", "I'm not special needs, but when it was cold I'd just wait inside all ready to go looking out the window on the door and run when the bus was almost at the stop.

Sensory issues are extremely common with Autism.\n\nHonk hooooooonk twice a day could possibly be upsetting to the son, let alone the pissed off neighbors.\n\nIdk why this is a convenience arrangement at all TBH after rereading a few times.
