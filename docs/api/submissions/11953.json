I was a bit cautious on providing an update, as I wanted to make sure he is indeed doing better before celebrating.\n\nOn the weekend leading to the big day I bought him his favorite food - these tiny fish that in my country are generally eaten whole, fried(anchovies?) that he loves to gobble up raw. I only ever give those as a treat maybe a few times a year since they're not exactly healthy for cats, but I made an exception since, you know, things could've gone terribly bad.\n\nThe operation went great, vet said there were no complications. I got him home in the afternoon of and he slept it off until midnight, when he started asking for food! He's been eating like he's trying to make up for the weight loss he suffered. He's also been more alert these days, started following me around again and begging for food and it looks like he's sleeping better, too. He would generally just lay awake on his cat bed all day, looking unhappy, now he's sleeping soundly between meals. The only disconfort he has is related to the stitches on his gums, but they should fall off in a few weeks. Honestly, it's like they didn't remove only his teath, but also a chipped off a few years!\n\nI'd also like to thank all of you that called me out on using him as an excuse. You're right, I was using him as an excuse. No has never been a full sentence for me, so I am now actively looking into finding a good therapist. I still stand by my decision of not helping my sister out though, and many numbers and social media accounts have been blocked.\n\nI'm thinking about leaving this account active and add a final update in a week, or a month or a year or whenever it's time to bid Tom farewell. But for now, he seems happy, so I've no doubt I made the right choice.\n\n**1 CommentShareSave**", "created_utc": 1678465535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ntm7e/update_aita_for_choosing_my_senior_cat_over_my/", "score": 509, "replies": ["This was supposed to be part of the post, but character limit:\n\n*As for the people calling out our vet for being unethical...let's agree to disagree. Indeed, there are bad vets out there. As with all professions, a lot of individuals have chosen veterinary medicine in order to make money, with zero regards for their patients or their owners. There are vets who will drag your animal through unnecessary treatments or investigation just to blow up your bill. That is true.* \n\n*However, this is no reason to doubt each and every recommendation or treatment suggestion vets make. If something your vet says or does sends red flags, by all means, seek a second opinion. Ask them what meds they used and why, don't be afraid to ask questions.*\n\n *Educate yourselves, look up the issue online, check the practice's reviews, look if there are any fb groups dedicated to that particular ailment and ask for recommendations. But don't outright refuse to follow your vet's recommendation just out of fear of it being a cash grab. Your pet only has you to advocate for their well-being, and not following through with the treatement may very well cost them their lives.*", "Congrats on successful operation.", "I am so glad Tom is doing better!", "Awwww.... I'm so glad your Tom baby is doing well.   Your sister can have her flying monkeys get together and donate to her cause.   You are not obligated to lend her money.", "I'm so happy that Tom is much better!", "Glad to hear he's doing better!", "Well said. Each veterinary decision is different.", "I work in vet med and we know the risks of surgery, especially a cat of Tom\u2019s age. We put senior cats under regularly for dentals because the benefit of a clean and healthy mouth without painful, rotting teeth outweigh the anesthetic risks. And it\u2019s clear from the way Tom is recovering! \n\n(FYI for those who might face the decision that OP and Tom had to make: A good vet will pre-screen before surgeries (bloodwork and chest rads. A full cardiac work up if there are suspected heart issues). They will put your cats on IV fluids and have an emergency drug protocol and calculated. They\u2019ll also be monitoring all vitals throughout the procedure)", "Good for Tom! OP, I hope it's a long, long time before you have to write that sad final update.", "So happy tonheqr Tom is on the mend. The curiosity in me want know, did your sister end up homeless?", "I've only just seen the first post - your lovely Tom is certainly a handsome boy - but remember one thing: your sister and her husband put themselves in the situation they find themselves in and it is NOT your fault in any way. I'm so glad your Tom came through the op well and is gradually feeling better.  Hugs to you and Tom.", "I am so happy for you and Tom! \nAlso can we please have a picture of Tom?\n\nOn another note - have you heard anything from your sister or mom?", "I'm so happy your fuzzy friend is alive and recovering. And very happy that people are blocked. You and your Tomcat can take on the world!", "I saw you mentioned his teeth being removed, i'm curious what happened to need that? My late cat had an issue where he essentially became allergic to the plaque on his teeth and would be on steroids to reduce the swelling (just teeth cleanings wouldn't stop all of the plaque) so the only solution was to remove all of his teeth longterm as the steroids were losing effectiveness after two years, though it didn't really stop him from eating the same things. He refused to eat wet food and kept eating dry food and just gummed it apart i guess, he was a weird cat, great but very weird. Just curious if it was the same issue", "Regarding your last post, nta. Your whole family bombarding you after denying your sister, even more fuel to the fire showing she truly was the golden child.", "I'm so happy for you and Tom! Yes, dental work can seem like it adds years to their lives. Think how misable you are when you have a toothache.\n\nYou can decide who you help and who you don't, and if others aren't willing, that's on them. They shouldn't try and make you do something they won't.\n\nBest wishes!", "Glad to hear Tom and you are both doing better!", "If you want to go to school and make a ton of money vet is not a great choice anyways lol. For the years that you are in school there are much more lucrative jobs and vets don't usually make much above 6 figures. I don't think most vets are in it for the money.", "This comment from the original post has a picture!  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g1t63/comment/jao6isl/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "it was the same thing, he has auto-immune gingivites. He was diagnosed a couple of years ago, the vet we saw back then was against doing a full extraction at that time and I had him on anti-inflammatory steroid shots - i'd take him every other week or so whenever he had a flareup. Unfortunately, the drugs gave him anaemia, he stop assimilating and lost a lot of weight, started drinking a lot of water, so we attempted alternative treatments, including laser therapy, but nothing worked. I regret not asking for a full extraction earlier", "Thanks for this. Have an elderly pet going in Thursday for dental and lump removal, I know all this in theory but still always scary. Also had the \"priviledge\" of watching emergency dental on a 11 year old ferret - she broke her K9 and exposed the nerve. Do or die and she recovered very well.", "My cat (senior, health issues) needed his teeth removed. Our vet assessed my cat and then referred me to a specialist vet who worked in an animal hospital with an ICU. She said that with his health issues it was best and she was right. The surgery was challenging and then my cat arrested and after he was resuscitated he stayed in ICU a while. He would have died without the skill of the vet and ICU setting. He was able to come home and like OP's cat, he had a new lease on life. \n\nSo I'd add: not just a good vet assessment but the appropriate setting for the surgery.", "Exactly this. Getting into medical school is a lot easier and more profitable. We vets have the same student loans and make a fraction as much as an MD. I never suggest anything to pad my pocket, but I have been accused of upselling for recommending a state required rabies vaccine for $10 so there's that.", "Yeah it was rough, It was really apparent when the steroids stopped working for him since he just became withdrawn and of course his gums were inflamed. I can't even imagine what that felt like, though the full extraction they did really did just fix everything, i was shocked that within a week he was completely normal again doing cat stuff and eating exactly the same foods, it was a much faster recovery than i thought honestly, never seemed to slow him down at all for another 4 years or so before he passed. Bright side, getting your finger chewed on by a toothless cat is the weirdest but also funniest feeling ever, he'd get mad and gum you for not getting him food fast enough, he was a very crotchety old cat.\n\nAlso, Just to say, No way your an AH for doing this. I found after the surgery for my cat it really breathed a lot more life into his years and after seeing that, i can't imagine another cat animal wouldn't want that same chance for a much better quality of life. All things considered, the teeth surgery didn't seem near as bad as other types of surgerys to recover from. Regardless of age, no way it'd be okay to just let him go because of a teeth thing like this without trying to give him a shot at a better life.", "My senior cat needed his teeth removed. They were causing him so much pain, and he was miserable. The surgery was scary, because he was 17 at the time, and I had a long conversation with the vet about expectations. He looked like hell for 3 days, and I thought I made the worst mistake. The next day, he was up and yelling at full volume for food! That surgery gave him a whole new lease on life, and he was so much more playful and happy in his final years. Worth every penny, and worth the 3 days of my sobbing because I thought I made him suffer.", "lmao even my indoor cats get their rabies shots. all it takes is one feral break in or whatever.", "Right? How many people wind up with bats getting into their homes?"]}
