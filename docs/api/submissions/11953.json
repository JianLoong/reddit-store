I was a bit cautious on providing an update, as I wanted to make sure he is indeed doing better before celebrating.\n\nOn the weekend leading to the big day I bought him his favorite food - these tiny fish that in my country are generally eaten whole, fried(anchovies?) that he loves to gobble up raw. I only ever give those as a treat maybe a few times a year since they're not exactly healthy for cats, but I made an exception since, you know, things could've gone terribly bad.\n\nThe operation went great, vet said there were no complications. I got him home in the afternoon of and he slept it off until midnight, when he started asking for food! He's been eating like he's trying to make up for the weight loss he suffered. He's also been more alert these days, started following me around again and begging for food and it looks like he's sleeping better, too. He would generally just lay awake on his cat bed all day, looking unhappy, now he's sleeping soundly between meals. The only disconfort he has is related to the stitches on his gums, but they should fall off in a few weeks. Honestly, it's like they didn't remove only his teath, but also a chipped off a few years!\n\nI'd also like to thank all of you that called me out on using him as an excuse. You're right, I was using him as an excuse. No has never been a full sentence for me, so I am now actively looking into finding a good therapist. I still stand by my decision of not helping my sister out though, and many numbers and social media accounts have been blocked.\n\nI'm thinking about leaving this account active and add a final update in a week, or a month or a year or whenever it's time to bid Tom farewell. But for now, he seems happy, so I've no doubt I made the right choice.\n\n**1 CommentShareSave**", "created_utc": 1678465535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ntm7e/update_aita_for_choosing_my_senior_cat_over_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["This was supposed to be part of the post, but character limit:\n\n*As for the people calling out our vet for being unethical...let's agree to disagree. Indeed, there are bad vets out there. As with all professions, a lot of individuals have chosen veterinary medicine in order to make money, with zero regards for their patients or their owners. There are vets who will drag your animal through unnecessary treatments or investigation just to blow up your bill. That is true.* \n\n*However, this is no reason to doubt each and every recommendation or treatment suggestion vets make. If something your vet says or does sends red flags, by all means, seek a second opinion. Ask them what meds they used and why, don't be afraid to ask questions.*\n\n *Educate yourselves, look up the issue online, check the practice's reviews, look if there are any fb groups dedicated to that particular ailment and ask for recommendations. But don't outright refuse to follow your vet's recommendation just out of fear of it being a cash grab. Your pet only has you to advocate for their well-being, and not following through with the treatement may very well cost them their lives.*", "Congrats on successful operation.", "I am so glad Tom is doing better!", "Awwww.... I'm so glad your Tom baby is doing well.   Your sister can have her flying monkeys get together and donate to her cause.   You are not obligated to lend her money.", "I'm so happy that Tom is much better!", "Glad to hear he's doing better!", "Well said. Each veterinary decision is different.", "I work in vet med and we know the risks of surgery, especially a cat of Tom\u2019s age. We put senior cats under regularly for dentals because the benefit of a clean and healthy mouth without painful, rotting teeth outweigh the anesthetic risks. And it\u2019s clear from the way Tom is recovering! \n\n(FYI for those who might face the decision that OP and Tom had to make: A good vet will pre-screen before surgeries (bloodwork and chest rads. An full cardiac work up if there are suspected heart issues). They will put your cats on IV fluids and have an emergency drug protocol and calculated.)"]}
