I was a bit cautious on providing an update, as I wanted to make sure he is indeed doing better before celebrating.\n\nOn the weekend leading to the big day I bought him his favorite food - these tiny fish that in my country are generally eaten whole, fried(anchovies?) that he loves to gobble up raw. I only ever give those as a treat maybe a few times a year since they're not exactly healthy for cats, but I made an exception since, you know, things could've gone terribly bad.\n\nThe operation went great, vet said there were no complications. I got him home in the afternoon of and he slept it off until midnight, when he started asking for food! He's been eating like he's trying to make up for the weight loss he suffered. He's also been more alert these days, started following me around again and begging for food and it looks like he's sleeping better, too. He would generally just lay awake on his cat bed all day, looking unhappy, now he's sleeping soundly between meals. The only disconfort he has is related to the stitches on his gums, but they should fall off in a few weeks. Honestly, it's like they didn't remove only his teath, but also a chipped off a few years!\n\nI'd also like to thank all of you that called me out on using him as an excuse. You're right, I was using him as an excuse. No has never been a full sentence for me, so I am now actively looking into finding a good therapist. I still stand by my decision of not helping my sister out though, and many numbers and social media accounts have been blocked.\n\nI'm thinking about leaving this account active and add a final update in a week, or a month or a year or whenever it's time to bid Tom farewell. But for now, he seems happy, so I've no doubt I made the right choice.\n\n**1 CommentShareSave**", "created_utc": 1678465535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ntm7e/update_aita_for_choosing_my_senior_cat_over_my/", "score": 4064, "replies": ["This was supposed to be part of the post, but character limit:\n\n*As for the people calling out our vet for being unethical...let's agree to disagree. Indeed, there are bad vets out there. As with all professions, a lot of individuals have chosen veterinary medicine in order to make money, with zero regards for their patients or their owners. There are vets who will drag your animal through unnecessary treatments or investigation just to blow up your bill. That is true.* \n\n*However, this is no reason to doubt each and every recommendation or treatment suggestion vets make. If something your vet says or does sends red flags, by all means, seek a second opinion. Ask them what meds they used and why, don't be afraid to ask questions.*\n\n *Educate yourselves, look up the issue online, check the practice's reviews, look if there are any fb groups dedicated to that particular ailment and ask for recommendations. But don't outright refuse to follow your vet's recommendation just out of fear of it being a cash grab. Your pet only has you to advocate for their well-being, and not following through with the treatement may very well cost them their lives.*", "Congrats on successful operation.", "I am so glad Tom is doing better!", "Awwww.... I'm so glad your Tom baby is doing well.   Your sister can have her flying monkeys get together and donate to her cause.   You are not obligated to lend her money.", "I'm so happy that Tom is much better!", "Glad to hear he's doing better!", "Well said. Each veterinary decision is different.", "I work in vet med and we know the risks of surgery, especially a cat of Tom\u2019s age. We put senior cats under regularly for dentals because the benefit of a clean and healthy mouth without painful, rotting teeth outweigh the anesthetic risks. And it\u2019s clear from the way Tom is recovering! \n\n(FYI for those who might face the decision that OP and Tom had to make: A good vet will pre-screen before surgeries (bloodwork and chest rads. A full cardiac work up if there are suspected heart issues). They will put your cats on IV fluids and have an emergency drug protocol and calculated. They\u2019ll also be monitoring all vitals throughout the procedure)", "Good for Tom! OP, I hope it's a long, long time before you have to write that sad final update.", "So happy tonheqr Tom is on the mend. The curiosity in me want know, did your sister end up homeless?", "I've only just seen the first post - your lovely Tom is certainly a handsome boy - but remember one thing: your sister and her husband put themselves in the situation they find themselves in and it is NOT your fault in any way. I'm so glad your Tom came through the op well and is gradually feeling better.  Hugs to you and Tom.", "I am so happy for you and Tom! \nAlso can we please have a picture of Tom?\n\nOn another note - have you heard anything from your sister or mom?", "I'm so happy your fuzzy friend is alive and recovering. And very happy that people are blocked. You and your Tomcat can take on the world!", "I saw you mentioned his teeth being removed, i'm curious what happened to need that? My late cat had an issue where he essentially became allergic to the plaque on his teeth and would be on steroids to reduce the swelling (just teeth cleanings wouldn't stop all of the plaque) so the only solution was to remove all of his teeth longterm as the steroids were losing effectiveness after two years, though it didn't really stop him from eating the same things. He refused to eat wet food and kept eating dry food and just gummed it apart i guess, he was a weird cat, great but very weird. Just curious if it was the same issue", "Regarding your last post, nta. Your whole family bombarding you after denying your sister, even more fuel to the fire showing she truly was the golden child.", "I'm so happy for you and Tom! Yes, dental work can seem like it adds years to their lives. Think how misable you are when you have a toothache.\n\nYou can decide who you help and who you don't, and if others aren't willing, that's on them. They shouldn't try and make you do something they won't.\n\nBest wishes!", "Glad to hear Tom and you are both doing better!", "If you want to go to school and make a ton of money vet is not a great choice anyways lol. For the years that you are in school there are much more lucrative jobs and vets don't usually make much above 6 figures. I don't think most vets are in it for the money.", "This comment from the original post has a picture!  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g1t63/comment/jao6isl/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "it was the same thing, he has auto-immune gingivites. He was diagnosed a couple of years ago, the vet we saw back then was against doing a full extraction at that time and I had him on anti-inflammatory steroid shots - i'd take him every other week or so whenever he had a flareup. Unfortunately, the drugs gave him anaemia, he stop assimilating and lost a lot of weight, started drinking a lot of water, so we attempted alternative treatments, including laser therapy, but nothing worked. I regret not asking for a full extraction earlier", "Thanks for this. Have an elderly pet going in Thursday for dental and lump removal, I know all this in theory but still always scary. Also had the \"priviledge\" of watching emergency dental on a 11 year old ferret - she broke her K9 and exposed the nerve. Do or die and she recovered very well.", "My cat (senior, health issues) needed his teeth removed. Our vet assessed my cat and then referred me to a specialist vet who worked in an animal hospital with an ICU. She said that with his health issues it was best and she was right. The surgery was challenging and then my cat arrested and after he was resuscitated he stayed in ICU a while. He would have died without the skill of the vet and ICU setting. He was able to come home and like OP's cat, he had a new lease on life. \n\nSo I'd add: not just a good vet assessment but the appropriate setting for the surgery.", "Exactly this. Getting into medical school is a lot easier and more profitable. We vets have the same student loans and make a fraction as much as an MD. I never suggest anything to pad my pocket, but I have been accused of upselling for recommending a state required rabies vaccine for $10 so there's that.", "Yeah it was rough, It was really apparent when the steroids stopped working for him since he just became withdrawn and of course his gums were inflamed. I can't even imagine what that felt like, though the full extraction they did really did just fix everything, i was shocked that within a week he was completely normal again doing cat stuff and eating exactly the same foods, it was a much faster recovery than i thought honestly, never seemed to slow him down at all for another 4 years or so before he passed. Bright side, getting your finger chewed on by a toothless cat is the weirdest but also funniest feeling ever, he'd get mad and gum you for not getting him food fast enough, he was a very crotchety old cat.\n\nAlso, Just to say, No way your an AH for doing this. I found after the surgery for my cat it really breathed a lot more life into his years and after seeing that, i can't imagine another animal wouldn't want that same chance for a much better quality of life. All things considered, the teeth surgery didn't seem near as bad as other types of surgerys to recover from. Regardless of age, no way it'd be okay to just let him go because of a teeth thing like this without trying to give him a shot at a better life.", "My senior cat needed his teeth removed. They were causing him so much pain, and he was miserable. The surgery was scary, because he was 17 at the time, and I had a long conversation with the vet about expectations. He looked like hell for 3 days, and I thought I made the worst mistake. The next day, he was up and yelling at full volume for food! That surgery gave him a whole new lease on life, and he was so much more playful and happy in his final years. Worth every penny, and worth the 3 days of my sobbing because I thought I made him suffer.", "lmao even my indoor cats get their rabies shots. all it takes is one feral break in or whatever.", "Right? How many people wind up with bats getting into their homes?", "If you don't like \"No,\" you might ease into it with, \"Sorry, I can't.\". Their next response will either be \"oh, ok,\" or \"why not?\"\n\nIf they go with oh, ok.. you are done.\n\nIf they ask Why not?\n\"It just isn't something I'm ready to talk about.  I'm sure you understand.\"\n\nAnd then don't talk about it.\n\nGood luck.  My sister is a push over too.  I'm her mouthpiece. Like, when she needs to tell someone to f-off, she will tell them to talk to me about it.  Now, they know what is coming.  Lol", "Also it\u2019s your money. If it makes you happy to spend it all on your cat then fuck it.", "Oh, man, I saw what was wrong with Tom in your comments and I understand so well. Our Fern dealt with that- and our vet said it was better to take her to a specialist, basically a dentist for cats. I am in the US and if it helps anyone, going to the specialist rather than my local vet was a total of $4000, which included all meds, her follow up visit, as well as the surgery itself to remove all of her teeth and her stay overnight. \n\nFern was my wife\u2019s cat. She got her as a kitten and at the time, she was about 12. I put it all on my credit card without hesitation. And she was so stubborn. We were advised to try to make her food softer or easier to eat while she had stitches because she was on kibble. Tried wet food- nope. Tried her kibble with water- refused. Tried her kibble broken down to smaller sizes- screw that. Would only take her kibble as it was. \n\nWe lost her to a sudden blood clot that lodged in the spot where the vein splits for the legs- it\u2019s called a saddle thrombosis. Completely unrelated and happened just a few months later. Even if I had known, it was worth it. It was worth it to see how much life she got back in her, how eager she was to groom herself again, the adorable bleps. \n\nOP, you did the right thing. And be ready for Tom to have his tongue sticking out of his mouth all the time, because it is so cute and he will do it without his teeth holding his tongue back.", "Yaye for Tom! Im happy he's doing well :)", "My little girl, who just turned 10 years old (also a cat) Got all of her teeth removed about 2,5 years ago and she has gained weight is much more sociable. It was the best decision to have it done. She eats dry food without any problems.\nI am so happy your fur baby is doing well!!! And you are a fantastic cat mom for doing this for him", "So glad your boy is doing well, and thanks for the update. I wouldn't say you were using your kitty as an \"excuse\" but it will be great when you can refuse impositions without having to invoke somebody else, just because you have decided to answer no. Best of luck with the therapy!", "This is such wonderful news! Thank you for updating us. I was worried about him.\n\nI think that now you can lay your worry down, that finding a good therapist is exactly the right move. Blocking her and learning how to say no are the best things you can do for yourself.\n\nI send cuddles to Tom and wishes for many more happy years.", "Yeah, baby boy is doing good. As to money - Good job - stick to your guns and therapy always help.", "I love that that update was about the cat and not the sister!  Glad he's doing good!", "Just read your original post, you were in no way an AH for picking your cat's well-being over tossing money at your sister and BIL's ridiculous situation involving NFTs of all things.", "You\u2019re a lovely person and I\u2019m so glad Tom is doing well! You deserve so much better than the family you\u2019ve been given. Tom is your true family. Stay strong!", "Kitty loves the Fishie.", "Great update, go cat!", "I'm so glad to hear Tom is doing better!! Please give him all of the love and cuddles and an extra one from me.", "Yeah on Tom. Good on therapy.\n\nHoping I don't read Update on Tom for about 5 yrs....", "Cat tax!", "I have a cat with no teeth because she was allergic to her teeth and we didn't want to keep her on steroids and antibiotics. Tooth removal is actually common in general for cats, you weighed the risks and benefits. You're lucky to have your kitty.", "I'm so glad Tom is doing better! :D", "We recently found a stray. A vet check showed he was just 5yrs, but his former owners didn't want him back, he had been living rough for about a year. Anyway, we decided to keep him. We have only had him for 5 weeks and he has already cost us \u00a3500. he has had all but 5 teeth pulled, he is due for further surgery for his two incisors. (another \u00a3600). We don't have the cash but do keep a credit card for emergencies, thank goodness! It doesn't matter how long you have them, 21 years or five weeks, once you love them they always come first xx", "YAY TOM!!!!!", "Cannot agree more.   \n\n\nAs my Veterinarians always say, age is not a disease, esp. if the pets lead a very well taken care of life.   \nSo great that Tom is doing much better after his procedure!", "Thats great to hear!!! Good for you\n\nhugs to tom", "Agreed 100%. My vet requires a blood panel the day of surgery for any cat 7 years old or older. Younger than that and it's not required, but recommended. This is to cover their own backs. I've had a senior cat go through two bladder surgeries to remove stones in the last four years, and will do it again if I need to (she has a misshapen bladder so it's likely). Each time it's bought her another two years of good living that she otherwise would never have had. <3\n\nHonestly I just recommend the occasional bloodwork for your pet anyway, especially if they start acting different. It's the three year anniversary today of my CiCi's passing, and bloodwork before she got too bad told me she had cancer. Our current oldest cat just had bloodwork recently that revealed she's so severely anemic it's probably a tumor. It's sad news to be sure, but I am relieved to have the best idea of what the options are.", "Yup. It's just like for a human if they're doing it right. As long as it's not a massive emergency humans have blood work and screenings done prior to scheduled surgical procedures. Working as a phlebotomist in healthcare for over a decade I have seen people have to wait months for a surgery they needed because their A1c (blood sugar measurement) was too high and put them at risk of not healing properly. Shitty people are shitty people and they gotta make a living too unfortunately, you're going to find them in every field. Most vets do want what's best for your pet.", "> outweigh the anesthetic risks.\n\nMy cat has heart disease and the vets reaaaaally don't want to put him under for anything, and his teeth aren't great :(", "I have a super senior cat who may need work on his teeth soon so I appreciate this information", "Vet is also the profession (or at least one of the them) with the highest rates of suicide iirc, both for vets and vet techs/assistants. I have so much love stored in my heart for people in the profession, they have so much kindness in them, but I could never do it myself. \n\nThere are some clinics that are clearly profit based but I know my vet sure isn't. My vet quoted me 800 to 1200$ for a bladder stone removal surgery and when I called to ask how much I would owe after it was over they told me 600$ and I was so relieved I almost cried. For the time, money, and equipment they are probably not making much.", "He\u2019s a beautiful boy! \ud83d\ude0d", "I worked for a veterinary dentist... we specialized in geriatric and animals with other health issues that wouldn't normally be a candidate for dentistry. It was long hours and hard work but almost everyone noticed a difference in their animals once the teeth were removed/ issue fixed. It does cost a lot (some of the full mouth extraction surgeries could last 4-6 hours) but it is worth it in the end.", "Back when I worked in vet med it used to drive me nuts, too. I opted out in part because of the expected 6 figure student loan debt. Most of the people saying this have probably never seen a full, unsubsidized or uninsured human medical bill- vets are practicing medicine at nearly the same level yet people expect to pay a fraction of the cost. It's entitled and insane.", "We had the surgery done on one of our cats a few years ago, and it really helped with a number of health issues.", "I had a young cat who got sick and it progressed quickly. It looked like a cold, then pneumonia. My vet (country vet) didn't know what to make of it. I thought, I'll be damned if I let my li'l guy starve himself over a beatable illness!! I force-fed him for weeks. He did not get better but my God he fought so hard, even stumbling his way to the litterbox though he could barely walk at all and kept falling down. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI kept bringing him back to the vet & they finally realized he had FIP (they had only seen a dry case in the last 5 years, and Wilbur's was wet). I had already found that possibility via Google and knew that it was fatal and what I needed to do, but it was so so hard to say goodbye. He was only a year and a half old. \n\nI have so many regrets in how hard I worked to keep him alive by force-feeding him. He hated it. I couldn't have known but it's so hard to shake that \"I shouldn't have done that\" feeling. I'm so glad you didn't have to regret anything with your guy. I know exactly how those three days must have felt for you and it makes my heart hurt for you even though it's over now. <3", "FIP was basically a death sentence before they developed the GS drug some years ago. Without (in a lot of countries black market)treatment, nothing you could have done would have made a difference.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Please know you did the best you could with the information available to you.\n\nI lost a cat I raised from three days old due to a reaction to anesthesia when she was only a year old. Every procedure since on a pet has been anxiety central but I power through them knowing it\u2019s what is best.", "You're such an angel. I hope you know that even if your baby hated the feeds in the moment due to the discomfort, the comfort of nourishment to his ailing body most likely did far more good than you could see. Your intentions weren't to prolong his struggle, and you met all of his needs above and beyond while trying to diagnose him. Starvation is so much more painful and traumatic than a force feed, even if the cat \"seems\" better left alone. Cats will protest interventions in the moment if they have the ability/energy/will to do so, but they will very rarely show you how deeply miserable they are, so it can feel like a kindness to leave them alone. You absolutely did the right thing by your sweet baby while taking the time to figure out what the actual problem was. I'm sending buckets of bear hugs to you. I'll light a candle tonight for your baby too, and I'd love to know the name to whisper over it?", "It is so hard to make these decisions because we can't talk to them, know how they feel, or know the future. Don't beat yourself up over this. If you feel that you learned some lessons then take those and apply them to future decisions. If the only lesson was it didn't work and you made him suffer longer, then forgive yourself. You made the best decisions you could with what you knew and what the vets knew. \n\nMy dog had gotten a hip replacement and was not recovering with physical therapy the way he should. He was screaming during some of the stretches the therapist did and had us do. Turns out, he rejected the hip replacement because he was allergic to the glue or something. Our therapist was horrified at what she had ignored. I know she learned a lesson. The surgeon did too but because he wasn't there for the therapy I don't think it went quite as deep. The whole \"dogs don't reject hip replacements\" was proved wrong and we know not to trust completely anymore. Horrible experience.", "I am so sorry for your loss. I too have recently lost a young (barely 1 year old) cat to terminal lymphoma. I know exactly how it feels to sit there at the vet\u2019s office on Google knowing it is fatal and how hard it was to say goodbye. \n\nPlease take care. I hope that you can be kind to yourself, we only ever want the best for our fur children.", "I was bit by a bat in high school and had to undergo rabies vaccinations....not fun lol. Get your pets shots!", "I had no idea they developed anything, the last I had heard it was still largely a mystery. Thank you for this info!\n\nGive Tom a big kiss for me. He deserves the world. <3", "Ohhhh I'm so sorry you had that experience. I cannot even begin to imagine the heartbreak. My heart is going out to you!!", "Thank you, you're so kind. While his health was failing he drew a lot of comfort from laying his chin in my hands. He was not a cuddly cat ever, so this was a surprise. And when we said goodbye to him he breathed his last with his little head resting in my hands. His name was Wilbur. His brother, Orville, is still with us, and sometimes cries in the middle of the night almost like he's still looking for his brother, even though it's been years. \n\nI feel like I did learn from the experience with Wilbur, and that was how I was able to let my next cat go (to stomach cancer, she stopped eating and I knew it was time when I could not even ply her with a spinach leaf, her favorite thing). It's been 3 years exactly today. I mean, nothing makes it \\*easy\\*, but there is something to be said about understanding the options and quality of life of your pet.\n\nThank you for your words. I really do appreciate them, and I'm sure other people reading this thread may draw some comfort from them, too. It's hard to see your pets suffering. We have seven cats now and all but one are seniors so I'm sure I'll be drawing upon these thoughts in future months. <3", "I'm so so sorry that happened to you with your dog. That sounds absolutely devastating, especially after the no-doubt high cost of the replacement in the first place! (It's bad enough that it costs a lot, but to have that cost and then have it fail must have felt a million times worse.) I am sending you hugs right now. <3 <3 \n\nI've mostly made peace with the situation with my Wilbur, and when it came time for CiCi to go (three years ago today), I was able to make that choice. We found that she had cancer and it was likely stomach cancer, and a few months after that she simply stopped eating. My experience with Wilbur helped me let go before she got too bad. The sun was shining and she sat in my lap in the truck all the way there and it was so peaceful. I could not have asked for a better day. It was the only sun we had on a week either side of that day too.", "Your poor baby. I agree, intention is the most important thing when it comes to this sort of thing. I've only ever wanted the best for my creatures. Sending hugs your way for your recent loss. <3", "The problem with it is that it's not pattented from what i hear, so in a lot of countries it's not available at the vet's. You have to order it from china or know someone who imports it, it's really sketchy. But it does work, kitten lady has shared on youtube her experience successfully treating her cat for fip", "Yes! I have a friend who saved both their kittens with smuggled in drugs.  The vets couldn't help at all.", "Congrats! sounds like they had dental issues? My friend's dog had the same issue (10 year old yorkie at the time, ) After she got her teeth removed she became a puppy, so much energy and eats so much now. \n\nAlso, have you paid the cat tax? (posting pics of the kitty)", "Good for Tom! \n\n\nHe sounds like a very very good cat. You are lucky to have him, and I saw in your original post that he is 21? That is old for a cat. One day he may beat the record for the oldest cat on planet earth. \n\nWith all of this being said, you are still NTA and can all of us here have a pet tax of cute Tom?", "Thank you for the kitty update. I'm happy for the good news and happy that you are getting therapy. I think keeping your boundaries is very good and wish you the best going forward.", "Glad to hear he's doing well! :)", "So great to hear Tom is doing alright! My vets have told me cats could live without their teeth. This really surprised me. I had a cat who was really scared and I couldn\u2019t touch him. But after 2 of his teeth got removed he was all lovey dovey and wanted to be with me all the time. So it can change a cat completely! Love to hear Tom has a few more years to go and with more quality of life.\n\nI hope you will keep doing well because you sound awesome.", "Hey, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finally resolving some childhood issues, and that Tom is on the mend! As for the people criticizing the vet stuff, don\u2019t stress it! I had a senior golden retriever who went downhill. Took her to the vet and the vet said \u201clet\u2019s try this\u201d and it got us 3 more awesome months where she wasn\u2019t suffering for a small minor surgery and it wasn\u2019t about profit. Sometimes it\u2019s right and it\u2019s different for every pet. But when those three months were up it was obvious. Your pet will let you know and you\u2019re the one who lives with him. Sounds like you made the right call and I\u2019m glad you get more time with Tom. Good luck!", "Yay Tom!!!", "\ud83c\udfc6take my poor person award.  Tom is so handsome and I'm so happy he's doing better!", "I'm so so happy for your cat!!", "So happy for you and Tom! Sending good vibes your way and really glad you stood your ground.", "I work in vet med.  *Age is not a disease*.  Yes, the older an animal gets, the more likely it is to have underlying health concerns, but that's why responsible veterinary teams have preanesthetic bloods, survey x-rays to look and heart and lung health, and even echocardiograms to assess heart health.  If there is no underlying disease, leaving rotting, infected teeth is guaranteed to decrease an animal's lifespan and contribute to systemic illnesses.  I've seen so many small dogs who were horribly aggressive become like lambs after their dental health was finally addressed!  Or cats who, like OP's Tom, seem to become younger.  Being freed of constant pain is like a miracle to those animals.", "Thanks", "I was very thankful of the ER vet who told us we should wait to see our primary vet on Monday to see if our cat had a bowel obstruction and do xrays because it would cost insanely more to do it there and she felt our cat could hold out 2 more days. They just gave her fluids and saw our primary on Monday and she did have an obstruction and everything cost about $1500 compared to the like $5-6k the ER quoted us. \nAlso, you did the right thing, your sister's probably not used to hearing someone tell her \"no\" and she really needs to hear that more. Especially if you've been LC.. family or not they can't just waltz back in and pretend like you owe them.", "Just went through this. Found out my cat has HCM just before getting a bunch of her teeth out and was so worried about the procedure, but she did great and now less than a day later she\u2019s already seeming so much happier and energetic than I\u2019ve ever seen her before (I got her when she was already 5 so I missed out on that kitty energy)", "\n>FYI for those who might face the decision that OP and Tom had to make: A good vet will pre-screen before surgeries (bloodwork and chest rads. A full cardiac work up if there are suspected heart issues).\n\n\n\nYes! My cat needed a tooth removed but after tests it was determined that her heart was too weak to be put under (pretty bad heart murmur) and it was advised not to do the procedure. I'm glad I listened to them and I was with her when she went. I've trusted that vet with all my cats since then. Most vets really do care about the wellbeing of thr animals in their care.", "My cat just had 2 dental surgeries at 21 years of age. My vet did do the bloodwork, etc and explained everything. The first surgery he had 9 teeth removed and the 2nd yesterday was only 1 canine. (it was rubbing against his upper jaw causing issues) He is doing great and wanted to eat and move around last night. They said he was a rock star!", "I just had my elderly pet in surgery for dental and lump removal. I was a total wreck beforehand. It went perfectly fine, and yours will too!!", "I had to take my senior dog to a veterinary dentist because of his heart issues. So he also has a cardiologist.  He also had a major health scare recently that was gall bladder related which meant a visit to an emergency vet. He and his bud have \"well baby\" visits this weekend and I scheduled an ultrasound in advance to make sure his gall bladder is doing better or at least maintaining.\n\nThe cost of his upkeep has been more than 10 times that of my other dog.

My mind was just forming the thought that \"that dog looks just like, and moves just like, \\[the dog we lost\\]\" when my boy pulled the leash out of my hand and went running over at top speed.

It was in the works for over a year, but first we had to get her thyroid issue stable because they didn't want to risk anything by putting her under. It was blimmon stressful, because we had another older cat who needed dental and unfortunately his health was much worse then expected (we got adopted him, but it was believed he was probably a Maine coon/ Forest cat kitten mill creation) and he never got the surgery.\n\nThe only reason I done it was because I had 100% faith in the vet team, I knew they knew her and it's like she's a much younger cat! We didn't realise how much her quality of life decreased until those teeth were gone. She's grooming, eating hard food and playing again.

Our now senior dog had a really bad infected ulcer in his eye that required his eye to be removed. Our new vet did blood work and said even with his age he would do fine with surgery. And he did! I was terrified of a repeat scenario but it went great and he\u2019s adjusting to being completely blind (his other eye already had cataracts and his lens slipped down during the surgery or just after). It\u2019s only been a couple of days but you have to trust your vet.", "Full extraction doesn't fix all of them unfortunately so it's not always the right thing to do.

No excuse whatsoever because his actions ruined both his and his wife's lives, but even then I feel like a gambling issue with crypto is a little more understandable than creating financial problems over NFTs.

A full cardiac work up if there are suspected heart issues)\n\nWhen my boy was sick last year, his heart murmur became a much bigger deal than ever before. It had been such a non issue that I honestly forgot he had it.. But then he got really sick, and it was a struggle to even hydrate him because of it. He was only 12, but there wasn't much they could do beyond imaging and medication because of his heart. They hesitated to even put him on iv fluids (but eventually did and they helped quite a bit with his quality of life). He passed away quickly, likely of pancreatic cancer, but we just don't know, and we don't know how much the inability to do surgery impacted his care.\n\nOP is right - you may not be able to trust every vet, but I think the majority are responsible and genuinely want to help animals. My vet wouldn't do surgery on my little guy because he knew it wouldn't go well. It was the right call. I was holding him at the end, and it was peaceful. Listen to your instincts, but listen to your vet, too.", "My sister's mastiff mix had one of his legs surgically amputated at age 12, and so many people were such dicks about putting a dog through that at \"the end of his life\", and how shitty the vet must be, but the only reason the vet even recommended the surgery was because the dog was in amazing health for his age. It did take a week or two longer for him to recover from the initial surgery than it would for a younger dog, but once he was up and moving, he was like a whole new dog. And he lived for 5 more blissful years.", "Thank you so much for what you do.  I've got a 13 year old who just had her 2 little fangs removed earlier this week.

If I had the money and they had the same thing going on as your Tom, I would do it.", "I agree. My vet often suggests lots of diagnostic tests, because she wants to KNOW what is wrong before she makes recommendations.

Give him hugs for all of us.\n\nThank you for posting this. My family and I adopted a feral cat. Been working with him for over a year, and he's been in the house now since December. Every day is a step forward, but we're 99% sure he has bad teeth that need taken care of. Just trying to get more weight on him first, as we know darn well he is too underweight at the moment to be put under safely.

Fingers crossed that his recovery continues well and that he enjoys his old age for however long you're blessed to have him.", "My roommate and I have 3 cats: eldest will turn 12 next month, the younger two will be 4 in a few months. We got all 3 when they were just a few months old. The eldest we rescued  when she was roughly 5 months old after she was \"left\" outside our apartment. We tried to find her original home but no one came forward. We had to declaw and spay her in order to keep her (our complex had a no pet policy but given the circumstances, we got permission.) We hate she had to be declawed but she'd have been put down if we didn't keep her, as she is feline leukemia positive or has FIV (different vets have told us different diagnosis and I'm not sure which she actually has.)\n\nThe younger two we adopted from our local humane society, aged 2.5 months. They were found together and thought to be from the same litter, but the smaller of the two definitely was delayed by 6 weeks in his development milestones, so he was either a different litter or the runt. \n\nAll 3 go to the vet 2x per year for check ups, one of those visits being a dental cleaning visit. We always tell our cats it's \"drunk butt kitty day\" on those days due to the anesthesia wearing off. But we do our utmost to care for all 3. The younger 2 get the feline leukemia or FIV vaccine, plus the eldest tends to avoid the older of the 2 boys as he can be a brute (a loving,snuggly brute, but a brute nonetheless.)\n\nOP, I'm glad you're doing all you can to hive your kitty as much time, comfort and care as you can. Keep giving him all the love. Your sister and her husband can figure out how to recover from their failure, the hard way. I'd do the same as you, in your shoes. Give that good boy some scritches from this random cat loving internet stranger."]}
