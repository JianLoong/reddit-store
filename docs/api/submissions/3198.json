I've done waxing before, and it fucking sucked. I cried halfway through because of the pain (I was 12 at the time) and when the lady was done I had these weird lumps all over my skin. Shaving to me feels uncomfortable. I don't know why but it's so itchy and my skin feels so prickly from it. I don't think having smooth skin with no hair is worth that uncomfort. I never even really hated my body hair.\n\nI told my mom I didn't want to get rid of my body hair. She said that everyone will judge me and say that I look like a man.

Is your family werewolves?", "I don\u2019t think you are an AH. I don\u2019t think your mom is TRYING to be either though. Your mom is doing the same thing most parents do. Letting you know how people will treat you if you don\u2019t conform. Your mom likely has her concerns for a reason. Terrible things have happened to women who present anywhere close to manly ( natural human features honestly). What you perceive as your moms shame of you or your expression might possibly just be her love for you causing her to fear the judgements people have of you. She probably doesn\u2019t fear her family hurting you but their remarks of you will give her insight to others thoughts on you. Everything she hears is going to be multiplied in her brain and her worry will take over. If you ever notice with most parents its always worry that the world won\u2019t accept their kid, so it will harm them.We can\u2019t change the world so in some way most parents try to save their kid from the world( or god), by changing them. It often causes rifts. The only time it doesn\u2019t honestly is if the parent can witness their child being accepted. In order for that to happen the parent has to make room for that opportunity by just allowing their child to be themselves. As long as themselves isn\u2019t a rude child that opens other peoples presents. That\u2019s when it\u2019s embarrassment over the child. You change that child for societies benefit if they are embarrassing or rude. You change the child for their own protection if you have seen or heard of people like them being harmed for being themselves in the world. Your mom fears the worlds perception of you. She could also be on high alert about your introvert behavior. She is just worried. Someday your mom will meet the quality people in your circle ( introverts seem to usually be quality over quantity) and relax a bit. I second the notion that makeup is itchy.  The shaving and waxing problems you had are also fairly normal. I hope you and your mom can see eye to eye soon. You are not wrong and your mom is just being a scared mom.", "If you had more time, I would say either you wear the dress with body hair, or you return the dresses for a nice pantsuit. But the wedding is tomorrow. So, yeah. You\u2019re right that people will judge you, and they also will judge your mom even though it\u2019s unfair. Personally, I would feel bad for my mom and shave the bare minimum. And say next time we are not doing this. I really, really don\u2019t want to call either of you an AH. I hope you can arrive at a decision that makes you both happy.", "NTA - But when you talk about body hair, does that include the armpits? hairy armpits are pretty unhygienic.\n\nI say this because I can't leave hair in my armpits. I always shave, if I don't shave and just apply deodorant, there's going to be an unbearable stench, especially if it's hot.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My dad hates hair and shaved his head every day for the last 30 years. I hate hair on my armpits and shave it every night of the year, but I don't mind hair on my legs and arms and only shave them if I have an event on where I want it to be cleanly shaven. Basically we each have a way we like our bodies and just because I like my armpits shaved doesn't mean the next person does, also its none of my business whether they do or not.\n\nDo whatever you like with your body!", "NTA your mother is nasty for being this obsessed and your father needs to protect you. I'm incredibly feminine in how I dress, it's my hobby and I take joy in it. If I did not, I would not. Who you are is more important than your hobbies (and make up, grooming, dressing up, organising and storaging, paying for in time as well as money and energy means it's not cheap, easy or casual hobby) and if you are clean while meeting the dresscode then you are fine. \n\nI have no doubt that you are beautiful but also that your beauty is one of the least interesting things about you, your parents should be willing to drop anyone who judges you based only on your looks and honestly comfortable physically harming anyone who suggests you need to spend hours doing things you don't want then wearing clothing you are not comfortable in in order to be acceptable. No. Anyone should be proud to be related to you. If someone decides that they need to comment on a young person's body hair then they have decided to be known as gross because that's just nasty. \n\nIf you want to get into more traditionally feminine grooming or dress or make up or whatever, delightful but only if it brings you joy and never if it does not.", "Nta for not doing something to your body to please others", "NTA.  I am curious how old you are though.  Your mother is obviously having trouble seeing you as an individual, and still wants to prepare you as one would a child.  Your body your choice for hair, clothes and makeup.  But I would caution you that this a special event and whatever you do decide on you should ensure it is appropriate as a sign of respect for the bride and groom, the other attendees and yourself.  \n\nI'm not sure if your mother is working this hard just because she misses having a little one to primp and preen before an event, or if you sometimes don't adequately prepare for social functions.  Its sounds like you are more introverted and prefer to be alone which is totally fine, but there are times when you will need to interact with others.  Believe me those times will go much smoother if you are clean, upkept and dressed appropriately.  I don't mean to say you should remove ANY hair, but the hair you have should be washed and brushed or tamed.", "NTA\n\nI applaud your for living your life the way you see fit. We all make compromises in life. It\u2019s part of living. However, I think being pressured into changing your outward appearance (that you\u2019re clearly comfortable with) for someone that is only concerned with how it reflects on THEM is a compromise I would not be willing to make. \n\nJust out of curiosity.

My sister prefers all her body hair too, though to be fair she\u2019s not nearly as hairy as I. I prefer a nice hair free physique. It\u2019s a personal choice. Key word being personal. Go. Live your life in peace! Life\u2019s too short to not be enjoyed because of a bit of hair.", "NTA and wearing a long skirt or a pantsuit will mean you won't have enough skin on display, and it's a nice compromise if you want to keep the peace. A plain underlayer would work too (tights, sleeves). But good on you for not giving in to the pressure, your hair, your skin, your choice!", "NAH, but- frankly, a lot of being an adult is doing things you don't like to do, and putting a good face on it. Masking/pretending to fit in is a good skill to have. If I were you, I would look at this wedding as a challenge, and as practice. \n\n(Also, a trick to shaving legs so you don't get ingrown hairs/deal with itchiness- use an electric trimmer to buzz 'em as low as the trimmer goes. The 1/16th inch of hair remaining is discreet, not itchy, and it's not like folks spend time staring at women's legs, anyway).", "NTA --- I agree with you 100% if you don't want to wax or shave your body hair that's your choice and your mother should respect both you and that decision, but a tip if ever in the future you do want to get rid of any body hair, a good moisturiser and rub that onto your skin after you are done should help with the itchy and prickly feeling.", "NAH... or soft YTA.\n\nYour mother is right to want to protect you from the likely reactions.\n\nYou shouldn't have agreed to attend a wedding as part of the wedding party, if you weren't prepared to adhere to the dress code.\n\nAt my wedding, my bridesmaids will be expected to wear dresses, shave/wax their body hair and wear make up and have their hair done by a hairdresser.... I don't mind paying for it. Anyone who refuses to adhere to that dress code can still attend, they just won't be a bridesmaid.

Could you have some autistic traits (feeling uncomfortable in crowd, sensory processing disorders...)? Have a look, don't worry it isn't a good or bad things, it would just mean that your brain processes information differently that a neurotypical person. I am not saying this is the case, but look into it, it might help share a light on other things to. From your post it seems that there is a cultural background to this wedding. Maybe you could compromise with your mum by wearing a smart trousers or jumpsuit. If not could tights or leggings underneath be an option? Regarding crowds try to find a compromise there, where you can be with people for a little bit, then go somewhere more quite to recharge your inner battery then repeat. Good luck, just breath and keep telling yourself that it is going to be OK, and you can do this.", "NTA - your body your choice. This could have been handled better by your mother though. You both could have had a conversation to see where the mutual ground is. You mom sounds like she is far too preoccupied with perceived judgment and keeping up appearances.", "NAH. I am sure your mother means we'll, even if she's wrong. Try sitting down with her and talking about how exactly going to social occasions and doing all this preparations make you feel.\nINFO: Do you do therapy?", "Oh, she actually wishes I would care. Maybe she grew up caring about others' opinions and wants me to as well? Because she seems to not like it when I say I don't care about the things that don't matter.", "YES!", "That's how I look at it.  My oldest hates shaving, she'll maybe do it a couple times a year but for the most part she chooses to just be natural.  I admire that in high school she can be confident enough to wear shorts/dresses and not care what people say about her legs.", "She's pressuring OP to go. Because otherwise SHE would be the only one without her daughter there. This is about how the mom is seen.", "I agree with you. \n\nNAH.", "I agree NAH\n\nOP, just so you know (I\u2019m not pushing) there are ways to make shaving more comfortable. If you exfoliate, shave with cream or moisture, and use lotion after, it helps with the rough skin, razor burn, and bumps.\n\nIn the end you do you \u263a\ufe0f", "My daughter once told me she wanted to grow her armpit hair just to annoy her housemates. I told her that was a bad idea. Simply because it would take too long.\n\nWe went out and bought a really cheap curly black wig from a fancy dress shop and cut it up to make armpit hair wigs. Housemates annoyed, problem solved!", "No I don't think they are haha", "Oh. That gives me some insight. I didn't realize she could just want me to not be bullied. I'm also not an introvert. I'm actually willing to speak to anyone who speaks English well and is around my age and stuff. I just don't want to go because everyone will speak my family's native language and I don't know it very well, plus I don't like the loud music and it will be worse because I have an ear infection. I have very separate reasons than social shyness for not wanting to go.", "Yeah that makes sense. I can't return the dresses since she had them tailored for me and they also cost a lot of money. Getting rid of them would just be disrespectful. But I agree with you. Maybe that's what I should do", "What makes hairy armpits unhygienic as long as you wash, use deodorant/antiperspirant?\n\n\nEvery single man you know has an unbearable stench?", "Yes it does. I keep myself clean. Cleanliness is extremely important in our culture so there is nothing unhygienic about my armpits because I wash them with soap like I do for the rest of myself. I also wear deodorant so I don't smell bad. I don't like getting rid of my armpit hair but my mom insists I do it. I sugar wax them around every month when they get long.", "My dad agrees with my mom. They won't \"drop\" anyone who will judge me because family members are invited to the wedding. Family is extremely important in our culture. It's probably placed above everything else. Family is of highest priority to most people who live here. Also violence is just. Unacceptable. People here hate anyone who has done something to hurt someone else.\n\nI don't think she is obsessed. I think she just doesnt want to see people being judgemental.", "Her mom is pressuring her to go, and I assume OP is relatively young. \n\n\nAlso, she's nowhere near in the bridal party. Doesn't even speak the primary language of the couple and barely sees them.", "Having good skin and no body hair is part of a dress code? That is wild. Yuck.", "Oh I actually used to think I have autism haha. I did some research and no I don't. I'm a neurotypical girl who has some autistic traits, but not as severe as actual autism. I can't get rid of the dresses because my mom had them tailored for me. They were expensive. I don't mind any dress that is comfortable and doesn't feel tight or have an uncomfortable fabric, but these dresses aren't like that. Tight around my stomach and have fabric that I don't like the feeling of.", "Because OP doesn't want to wax/shave her body hair or deal with a bunch of people she doesn't speak the language of, she must be autistic?", "It's normal in our culture. Women are very obsessed with beauty and stuff. Even though they typically cover up with tarha and stuff, they still want to be pretty.", "She knows that I do not like these social things. I don't like talking to her about how I feel and stuff. It just leads nowhere, and sometimes it turns into an argument. No I don't do therapy. My mom actually thought I was depressed once and sent me to a therapist and she said that I'm fine haha", "Yeah I\u2019m sure she was raised where those societal norms and standards for women were heavily criticized and enforced. You\u2019re standing up for yourself and unlearning that mentality of forced femininity. I\u2019m proud that you\u2019re taking charge of shaping how you view yourself and the world around you and refusing to comply. Good for you \ud83e\udd19", "Yeah I'm sure that's a part of it as well. Public image seems to matter more to Mom. Maybe out of social necessity, who knows.", "Thank you as well for the insight. Yes. Lots of parents are worried beyond reason ( to non parents)about their kids. I am sorry for assuming. This is what I get.lol.", "I live in a tropical country, even doing all the daily ritual of cleaning in the shower, the heat makes all our efforts in vain. Shaving is the only solution.", "Not for depression, I was thinking social anxiety or phobia. As someone that has social anxiety and had a bit of agoraphobia I could see improvement with therapy. You shouldn't think of therapy as something bad."]}
