I never wanted to go because I hate parties and celebrations and I don't even really know my uncle. He hasn't had much presence in my life, so I didn't care. My mom insisted that I go and she told me that all women will have their daughters with them except for her, so I agreed to come.\n\nShe got me 2 dresses, even though I didn't want them. She told me that I had to do makeup. Makeup is itchy and makes me uncomfortable. So I begged her not to give me makeup and she said okay. But now she is telling me I must get rid of my body hair. She said I can either get it waxed (a lady is coming to our home to prep all the female family members) or I can just shave it.\n\nNow, I really really really hate the obsession with getting rid of hair. I've done waxing before, and it fucking sucked. I cried halfway through because of the pain (I was 12 at the time) and when the lady was done I had these weird lumps all over my skin. Shaving to me feels uncomfortable. I don't know why but it's so itchy and my skin feels so prickly from it. I don't think having smooth skin with no hair is worth that uncomfort. I never even really hated my body hair.\n\nI told my mom I didn't want to get rid of my body hair. She said that everyone will judge me and say that I look like a man. I told her that they should mind their own business.\n\nWe argued about it and the conversation led to me telling her that I never wanted to go to the wedding in the first place, and that shes asking a lot from me. She knows I really hate any kind of social gathering and she knows I hate makeup and she knows I hate getting rid of body hair but she keeps on asking me to do these things and gets upset when I don't agree.\n\nShe said \"okay, fine\" but I just know that it isn't fine.\n\nI might be the asshole because my mom wants to keep a good image and she spent so long trying to laser her body hair off and now her daughter is ruining all of it and embarrassing her. She's right that people will be judgemental. They'll be judgemental of me but also of her for not pushing me to take off my body hair. I feel like I am being selfish and not considering how she feels, but at the same time she wasn't considering how I felt when she asked me to do all those things. I don't know who is the one here that should apologize. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Okay so let me clarify some things. I am not autistic, nor do I have ADHD. I'm neurotypical. \n\nThere isn't any kind of dress code that my uncle and his fiancee asked us of. They aren't telling us what to wear. Just don't outshine the bride, and I'm definitely not doing that.\n\nI cannot wear leggings. It's too late to go out shopping for some. My hair will stick through the light ones and no way my mom's going to let me wear the heavy ones. \n\nI'm not indian and I'm not asian. I'm arab. \n\nAlso, an update. I ended up shaving what she asked of me. I don't want to get into it but things got heated, and I said I'll do it. Now reviewing the comments, I guess it's wiser to just shave. I don't want my mom to get upset, and I certainly don't want her to be confronted by any judgement family members. I don't think I'm every agreeing to go any social gathering with her again.", "created_utc": 1669373629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4aj6x/aita_for_refusing_to_get_rid_of_my_body_hair_for/", "score": 857, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Letting you know how people will treat you if you don\u2019t conform. Your mom likely has her concerns for a reason. Terrible things have happened to women who present anywhere close to manly ( natural human features honestly). What you perceive as your moms shame of you or your expression might possibly just be her love for you causing her to fear the judgements people have of you. She probably doesn\u2019t fear her family hurting you but their remarks of you will give her insight to others thoughts on you. Everything she hears is going to be multiplied in her brain and her worry will take over. If you ever notice with most parents its always worry that the world won\u2019t accept their kid, so it will harm them.We can\u2019t change the world so in some way most parents try to save their kid from the world( or god), by changing them. It often causes rifts. The only time it doesn\u2019t honestly is if the parent can witness their child being accepted. In order for that to happen the parent has to make room for that opportunity by just allowing their child to be themselves. As long as themselves isn\u2019t a rude child that opens other peoples presents. That\u2019s when it\u2019s embarrassment over the child. You change that child for societies benefit if they are embarrassing or rude. You change the child for their own protection if you have seen or heard of people like them being harmed for being themselves in the world. Your mom fears the worlds perception of you. She could also be on high alert about your introvert behavior. She is just worried. Someday your mom will meet the quality people in your circle ( introverts seem to usually be quality over quantity) and relax a bit. I second the notion that makeup is itchy.  The shaving and waxing problems you had are also fairly normal. I hope you and your mom can see eye to eye soon. You are not wrong and your mom is just being a scared mom.", "If you had more time, I would say either you wear the dress with body hair, or you return the dresses for a nice pantsuit. But the wedding is tomorrow. So, yeah. You\u2019re right that people will judge you, and they also will judge your mom even though it\u2019s unfair. Personally, I would feel bad for my mom and shave the bare minimum. And say next time we are not doing this. I really, really don\u2019t want to call either of you an AH. I hope you can arrive at a decision that makes you both happy.", "NTA - But when you talk about body hair, does that include the armpits? \n\nI say this because I can't leave hair in my armpits.

No. Anyone should be proud to be related to you. If someone decides that they need to comment on a young person's body hair then they have decided to be known as gross because that's just nasty. \n\nIf you want to get into more traditionally feminine grooming or dress or make up or whatever, delightful but only if it brings you joy and never if it does not.", "Nta for not doing something to your body to please others", "NTA.

Its sounds like you are more introverted and prefer to be alone which is totally fine, but there are times when you will need to interact with others.

Maybe you could compromise with your mum by wearing a smart trousers or jumpsuit. If not could tights or leggings underneath be an option?

I know there are a million excuses that you or the people in the comments could come up with for your mom in this situation, but the bottom line is, your mom is clearly letting some of her own unprocessed trauma become your trauma, and that\u2019s not okay. Not saying that she\u2019s a bad person or anything, but it is her job as your parent to protect you from the world as much as she can, and instead she\u2019s taking the same monsters she\u2019s been running from, and pointing them straight at you. I understand that she\u2019s trying to protect you from societal judgement, but she\u2019s going about it so wrong. When a child bites someone, you don\u2019t scold the person that got bit and blame them for the child\u2019s action. You reprimand the child. In the same way, when someone makes a comment or gives you a look, her response should be to stand up to that person, not to force you to make yourself smaller. If I had to guess I would guess that she was raised to always make herself smaller and to always bend to the pressure of the world, and I\u2019m extremely impressed that you have clearly broken that line of thinking, because that\u2019s not easy to do, so really good job! Remember you are beautiful just as you are and you\u2019re not doing anything wrong.", "This is mostly addressed to comments, but I feel like a lot of people here are forgetting what body hair is. There are lots of comments about \"just wear a long skirt\". Body hair on women is not *just* leg hair. If your hair is light or fine, you might forget about it, but there are lots of people who have dark, thick hair on places other than their heads and legs. Forearms, armpits, sideburns, face etc. \n\nIf OP's mum has bought a dress and then expected any body hair visible to be removed, that might be more significant than just below the knees type shaving. \n\nOP, ALL your body hair is fine and normal. Good on you for knowing what you want to do with your body and sticking to it. It's hard when people pressure you, especially when your mum is saying things to try to embarrass or force you into it. Only do what you're comfortable with. If your mum keeps making a big deal about it, don't go. What your body looks like shouldn't be an issue at someone else's wedding, and your mum is trying to make it an issue.", "Mothers and daughters are a fraught relationship- when I was 16/17 I went to a family wedding - my mum has a lot of sisters - and the only one without a daughter said to the whole table \u2018isn\u2019t it funny how none of the daughters are as good looking as the mothers\u2019 \nMy mum\u2019s response was only later when she said if she had realised I was at the table her sister wouldn\u2019t have said it.
