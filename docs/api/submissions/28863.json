I highly suggest that any swaps that you or ex want to happen, occur via email or if possible through lawyers (I know this can be annoying and expensive hence suggesting email). You need to have a written record to keep her from scamming you out of time with your child. No more in person or over the phone custody time swaps whatsoever. Although, from the looks of it, she seems to want to take every holiday and not allow you any. Not exactly fair when custody is 50/50. Personally I would say no to the swap this time around.
