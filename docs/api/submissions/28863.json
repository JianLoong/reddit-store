I highly suggest that any swaps that you or ex want to happen, occur via email or if possible through lawyers (I know this can be annoying and expensive hence suggesting email).

Although, from the looks of it, she seems to want to take every holiday and not allow you any. Not exactly fair when custody is 50/50. Personally I would say no to the swap this time around.

When my parents divorced my mom bought the house next door so as the make the transition easier on me and my sister. My dad hated my mom so much that he built a huge fence separating the lots with a little door cut in for my sister and I to go back and forth. He has some serious need to always have the power and the upper hand.", "My ex and I have remained friends and co-parented our daughter without any drama.  We used to get comments all the time (DD is 32, so it's been awhile!) like 'how do you do that?'.  Answer - we're grownups and act like it. We joke about writing a book.", "It's very common. I am going through a divorce right now. I don't have a kid,  but my soon to be ex does from two different guys. Over the years, the fighting between all of them seems to be more about not so much having the time with their kids, but more making sure the other parent doesn't have that time. The kids are seen more as toys and not small people. They don't want to play with their toy, but they really don't want to share it either.", "True.", "I unfortunately know a lot of people in real life who do just that, so I can believe it.", "If you talk to anyone who works in family law, they will tell you almost all these crazy stories about women are exaggerated or entirely made up.\n\nEdit: https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/06/urgent-reforms-needed-protect-women-and-children-violence-custody-battles-un", "So the mom had last Christmas with the kid, and they're now asking for Thanksgiving AND Christmas this year with him - when does dad get to spend time with kid? \nFrankly I don't think an eight year old need to be around for a proposal anyway. She could have switch weeks.", "She wont give him the week back, and no parent with shared custody is allowed every single holiday - you split them up. They can go to his parents and celebrate any other week she has the kids. \n\nIf the boyfriend wanted to help he'd tell his gf to give the dad his week back. He'd tell her we can go see my parents for news year week instead.", "Well considering the kid isn\u2019t his kid.

But we'd already discussed marriage and he knew I'd say yes regardless of how he did it, so getting my kids involved made it perfect because of how happy they were about so I knew we had their approval. \n\nI think stuff like this depends on the couple. For example I think big public proposals are awful, and so are proposals on hiking trips, sounds bloody awful to me, but other people love those things.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out why the ex knows the boyfriend is going to propose over Thanksgiving. Seems like he was trying to come up with a plausible reason for them to have the kid for all the end of the year holidays/celebrations. All in all, it just seems fishy.", "Fuck that. OP put out his boundaries. If he caves to this, they will continue to try and take advantage of him. He had every right to tell bf where to go. It was absolutely inappropriate for bf to interject himself into the situation. OP\u2019s time with the kid is just as important and I am happy the kid has such a great dad that values his time with his child.", "Boyfriends are not step dads, neither has the power to do shit when it comes to custody agreements because it\u2019s not their bloody kid.", "This has nothing to do with the BF. What you should be doing is making sure your SON doesn't miss out on something important.", "Valid question.", "Exactly.", "My ex alienated our oldest from me last June, we\u2019re mid trial right now to get her back home AND remove our younger two and it sucks.. \n\nWe share legal and he won\u2019t sign consent forms that could help the kids in counseling, the doctor wants to have our son evaluated for possible autism won\u2019t let me, and the biggest disgusting act this past year\u2026 our son has enamel hypolasia severely on his 6 year molars. Dad refused to let me get treatment, said he was getting a second opinion and would not share information. This was stated all summer, but September I went ahead and said fuck you, after requesting info for weeks because our sons teeth started to break in pieces.. \n\nIn trial he tried to claim I went against what he wanted and didn\u2019t give him a chance, I submitted 20 different documents plus the kids teeth.

As he will be a step*father*.\n\nThis sub just has a hate boner for step families.", "Disclaimer, I'm high but your proposal sounds lovely. I'm reminded of when I was a single mom trying to find a partner that would accept my package deal, not great times. So to have found love that took on *your* package deal then turned around and included them in the proposal feels a lot like a declaration that from then on the kids are *your shared* package deal. But I'm maudlin, forgive me.", "Is your kids father in their life? Do they have a great relationship with their dad.", "Eh, some people like public proposals. They're not wrong as long as both sides are into them.", "EXACTLY what I was thinking. They both know about Thanksgiving and have planned Christmas to celebrate with family? Bullshit.", "[deleted]", "Yep. One which this comment completely ignores.", "Just one example: My dad would refuse to pay half my medical costs, including several long arguments where he'd scream at me that he was absolutely NOT gonna pay for half of my birth control because I shouldn't be on it (while in college).
