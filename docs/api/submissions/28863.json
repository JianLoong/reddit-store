I think you\u2019ve been more than fair with your ex given what you posted. I\u2019m a step parent myself and would never dare to step in between my wife and her ex regarding anything about my stepson unless both parties asked me. I don\u2019t think the ex was trying to be an asshat but he seriously overstepped.", "NTA. And I loved it when you insisted on getting your weeks back prior to you giving her your designated week. If she apologizes for her bf getting involved, you could go back to that stance.", "NTA\n\nHer boyfriend probably really just tried to help and may not have been aware of her screwing you over before. She may have told him that she had already been even with you/ the custody time. So I wouldn't be mad at him. It's a good thing that he wants the kids involved, instead of pushing the kid out of their life to \"start a new family,\" I'd appreciate that. \n\nBut you have your rights and did the absolute right thing. Stand your ground and don't get pushed out of the kids' life either! You're doing a great job. \nGood luck!", "NTA.   \nI\u2019d plan to have a wonderful Christmas with my son this year\u2026. \n\nShe\u2019s asking for two years in a row Christmas \u2026 and thanksgiving too? Nope.

Any day of the year will do just fine. But more to the point, are we supposed to believe OP's ex actually KNOWS that the BF is proposing at Thanksgiving? That's really weird, or one/both of them are lying. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI mean you said clearly at the end. Your ex wife\u2019s BF has no skin in the game. \n\nCall your attorney and let him/her know what\u2019s up.

It's pretty ballsy to call and ask for the week of Christmas again, after refusing to honor the agreement from last year! \n\nOn your part though, her bf *was* just trying to help out, and I'd guess he didn't even know that your ex refused to pay back the week from last Christmas. Either way, you could have politely told him to stay out of things just as easily as saying it rudely. When you have a cordial relationship with at least of of the adults at the ex's house, it makes it easier for you AND your child.**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I highly suggest that any swaps that you or ex want to happen, occur via email or if possible through lawyers (I know this can be annoying and expensive hence suggesting email). You need to have a written record to keep her from scamming you out of time with your child. No more in person or over the phone custody time swaps whatsoever. Although, from the looks of it, she seems to want to take every holiday and not allow you any. Not exactly fair when custody is 50/50. Personally I would say no to the swap this time around. If only for the fact that she decided not to honor her end of your agreement. If she gets mad about it remind her that she fooled you once and you won\u2019t allow it to happen again.", "NTA\n\nShe also FAFO.

It should be a romantic event. I cringe whenever someone gets kids involved in an engagement because it feels coercive to me", "Thanks for the expression, I hate it (kind of)", "He overstepped asking op to not spend any of the end of year holidays with their child. He tried to convince op because thats what ex wanted. Not actually whats fair or best for the child.
