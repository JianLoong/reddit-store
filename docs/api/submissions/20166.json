As a Backstory, My brother has always been the Golden Child due to his better grades, and wanting to follow the same career path as my father. My grades werent terrible the entire time, but when my mom got cancer, my father shut down and I was taking care of my mother and the house while i was 14, for about 2 years before my mom was feeling better.  I was never allowed to join any sports (he was allowed to do a Afterschool Video Game League since 'Its a Boys Thing' ) and when I did Reading Bowl, he joined specifically to take any attention off me since I excelled at Books.\nAll and All, I still Love my Brother, and he rarely takes advantage of being the Favorite. Until Now.\n\n He has come back home after time away, and during that time, I have bought several different things for My Bathroom thats attached to my room. I also have a cat whose litterbox is in the bathroom (my mom is allergic to cats) which i clean every other day and sweep each week. \n\n Now that my Brother is home, and Ive moved all my paints and Minatures into my room. Thats fine, Its to be expected, but what i didnt expect was my parents to start telling me to put the litter box in my room. My room isnt that big, and its already full of items i will take with me once i move after paying off credit cards (another story), not to mention i sleep on a mattress and Box Spring on the floor,  so theres not much room. \n\nThis all got started after my brother complained about not getting Privacy in my bathroom since Loki 'Keeps staring at me and wanting to escape the room'.  Sure hes a chaos Gremlin, but he's still just a cat. \nIve tried compromising by telling him to shut the door or leave it cracked if he uses the bathroom, and remember to open it later. He now refuses and now everyone is telling me to move it.\n\nSo I have. Ive moved it and Everything that I paid for in the bathroom. Since its so important that he have my bathroom, He can buy his own things, his own Soap, shampoo, Brush Etc. -Yes Hes been using all of MY things, and No he didn't ask-\n\nMy parents and Eric have yet to see the bathroom, but im sure they will find out today while im gone for work.

I\u2019m assuming neither of you pay rent so if that is the case (?) then your parents get final say on what can and can\u2019t be in THEIR bathroom. If they tell you to move the liter box into your room, then you should. Now if you both pay rent, then my initial statement about the discussion of community spaces should be addressed; Where there is equal compromising from both sides on what is best possible solution for both concerned parties.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
