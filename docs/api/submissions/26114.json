Sara has a bad attitude towards everyone including me, my husband and Rose. Sara will raise her voice against everyone who gets in her way or she will slam with doors if she don't get what she wants. Asking her to help with the table could cause the biggest argument in the house. Rose on the other hand helps with everything. Rose cleans the table, she cooks, she does groceries and she even helps with laundry whenever she can. Sara has always been like this and we even send her to therapy as well but nothing changed.\n\nI as a 48F have the biggest insecurities and health problems caused mainly by Sara. I work 2 jobs a day and even though Sara is home most of the time she doesn't help me the tiniest bit. In fact she will call me and demand me to bring food to her room and then she will slam the door in my face without a thank you. I am done with it and 1 week ago I yelled back at her. I told her that from now on 1- I won't do her laundry 2- I won't make her food 3- I won't buy things she likes when I go for groceries 4- I won't clean her room and 5- I will stop supporting her financially.\n\nRose said she understood why I am upset and is standing by me. Rose said that she will help me with cooking etc (Rose goes to school and I don't want her to be overtaken by household). I told her that it has no rush and I am only cooking for 3 . I am only cooking for the people who deserve to be cooked for and help me with the house. Sara has been going around telling people that I treat her bad and I am starving her. I again told Sara I am returning the exact same behavior she has been giving me for years. I started giving her an attitude as well. Sara is telling me that I have made my point and should go back to doing my duties. Some family members are getting involved as well and they are saying that I am a bad mother.

She sounds like a spoilt teenager and needs a reality check. I would suggest, however, that you make a strategy for going forwards, rather than just acting or reacting on emotion. \n\nWhat do you hope to gain from this, and how do you plan to get there? Is it just that you want more gratitude and respect, or do you want her to contribute certain chores or money towards the household? \n\n I think you need to be clear with her about what changes you want to see in her behaviour and how she can meet your requirements, plus what will be the rewards/punishments when she does or doesn't meet them.", "NTA.\n\n'doing your duties'??????\n\nwhat an entitled brat.\n\nyour duties ended the day she turned 18, became a legal person. and no, she may be legal but an adult she is not. an adult shoulders their own weight, helps around the house, pays rent, pays bills. it doesn't have to be much, it could be a token amount. its the gesture that counts.  \n\nit is / was nice of you for not kicking her out your house that specific day giving her attitude, her behavior. \n\nbut i think the gravy train has to stop, she has to learn that rules apply to her, too. like help, pay or get out.\n\nas for the meddling pesky's aka FaMiLy member, 'oh great, i will inform sara that you will house, feed and cloth her **and** give her an allowance on top since she (i assume) doesn't work'. \n\nlets see how fast they will decline this 'honor'. \n\nor if they accept it how long it takes sara to alienate them with her behavior, too.", "NTA. I would seek therapy in this situation. \n\nIt sounds like you have had difficulties setting boundaries with Sara for a long time. It also sounds like Sara is still very dependent on you, long past the point where she should be gradually becomining independent. It sounds like your stressed well past breaking point. There maybe some kind of developmental disabiility or mental health problem that hasn't been fully diagnosed or understood here that is playing into this. Even if not, a therapist can help you to work through new boundaries with your daughter.\n\nI think that if you are genuinely in a place where you don't want to cook and eat together with someone, that relationship needs a break and some time apart. It's understandable why your at this point. Is there anyway to work out some space for you and Sara? Like your taking a short vacation/weekend away while your partner/house minder stays home.\n\nIts great your setting boundaries. I would set up the same boundaries but rephrase them a little. You want to set up your expectations for how your daughters will be behave and have a set of consequences that apply for both daughters when they don't meet expectations. You want consequences that help them to think through their actions. You probably won't have to apply these consequences to Rose very often but its better if you don't single out Sara.\n\n1. You will follow an age approriate cooking and chore roster. Start small and build up. If you don't do the chores I won't buy the grocceries that you like and you will have to cook for yourself.\n2. You will do your own laundry and you will keep your room tidy. If you don't your clothes will smell and you won't be able to find things. If your room is unhygenic (not just messy) you will have to tidy it imeediately.\n3. If you are over 18 and not studying, I will still fund essentials. But I won't give you pocket money for your hobbies such as computer games, movies, going out with friends, latest fashion trends, a phone with an internet plan, unless you show me that you are putting in genuine effort to find and keep a job.\n4. If you really can't do these things you will see a therapist with me. I want to be supportive, I understand that there might some things going on for you that is making life hard. I like X, Y, Z about you. I think we can work through the things your struggling with together.", "Some of the things you\u2019re saying make me wonder if Sara may have something else going on\u2026 sounds like you\u2019ve tried to look into it by involving a therapist, but I don\u2019t think you can expect that to \u201cfix\u201d her. It takes two to tango, as they say\u2026 perhaps try checking out Dr Ross Greene\u2019s CPS model :)\n\nAlso, some of these things sound kinda similar to my experience with my younger sister.

And bringing food to her room?  Those are ridiculous even if she was the nicest person in the world.  It's time for Sara to leave home and make a life for herself.  If she stays, you should definitely stop catering to her.", "NTA.  Sara is an adult and needs to move out and be on her own.  She doesn't need to still be at home, so time to fly the nest.", "NTA.  Tell the peanut gallery they can take a 20 year old overgrown child in if they feel so strongly.  She needs to get a job and support herself!  What is with this entitled attitude of hers?  I would get therapy for her because this is not normal behavior.  Even a counselor would tell her to get her act together because you won't be around all of her life to support her lazy butt and her sister has her own life and won't be taking over.  Tough love dear!  You need to look that up and implement it.  Give her six months to find a job and contribute to the household or she will find herself homeless.  It's painful to do, but she needs this to pick herself up. Oh, and tell her you work two jobs, you don't have the TIME to clean the house or give in to her spoiled demands!

I would actually only by staples for the house and no treat or easy foods.  Sara will have to cook from scratch if she's hungry enough.\n\nCut off the internet.

Have you tried a psychiatrist?", "Sara is 20. She needs to contribute to the household in some way or get out. I wouldn't tolerate this behavior from a 13yr old, much less an adult. \n\nOP, NTA", "I, and I say this with much sympathy to OP, agree on the lack of parenting skills. The fact Sara is used to demanding that food be brought to her room (!) and that OP *would do it* (!!!) is a huge demonstration of it. Boundaries haven't been set. Responsibilities haven't been enforced. Most of all OP's daughter hasn't been shown how to be self-reliant.\n\nThat being said, OP, you're NTA for putting your foot down. And you might consider family therapy: Sara isn't the only one with a problem here.\n\nAnd the way Rose is the absolute opposite and so deeply helpful, no matter how high it speaks of her qualities as a person, also shows she's overcompensating a troubled family situation."]}
