{"id": 20846, "submission_id": "14llqse", "title": "AITA for leaving ex without a place to stay?", "selftext": "Okay the title isn\u2019t exactly the situation but I wasn\u2019t sure how to sum it up. So basically my ex (30m) and I (27f) signed a year lease, it was set to end today. We broke up in February and I moved out at the end of March. We didn\u2019t end on good terms and we don\u2019t talk anymore. \n\nBefore I moved out, he told me that he was probably going to be moving into a cheaper place closer to his work once the lease ended. That\u2019s the only information I had about his plans. Our leasing office requires 60 days notice and that 60 day mark was quickly approaching. By the time it came around, things between us were not good. I wasn\u2019t willing to leave it up to him to give notice because my credit is on the line so I went ahead and sent an email that we wouldn\u2019t be renewing. I didn\u2019t CC him in this email so he had no clue I gave notice. \n\nI moved out and we haven\u2019t spoken since. Today is the day the lease ends and he\u2019s meant to be moving out. The leasing manager called me and asked what time we would be turning in our keys. I explained the situation, that we broke up and I have been moved out and that he definitely knew the lease was up at the end of June but I had no idea what his plans were. She told me that I guess he (my ex) told the maintenance manager today that he wanted to switch to a month to month lease. The problem is that because I gave notice, they went ahead and leased the apartment to someone else already. She was going to call him as soon as we hung up and said she\u2019d call me later with an update. \n\nPart of me feels like once I moved out and we were no longer talking, he should\u2019ve called the leasing office to at least figure everything out. At the very least to find out more info on switching from a set lease to a month to month deal. But the bigger part of me that unfortunately still loves him, despite how much he hurt me, feels really guilty that I didn\u2019t remind him the lease was ending and let him know I gave notice. Honestly the day I moved out, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about it.\n\nAITA for this? When I gave notice, I didn\u2019t CC him because some things had happened that really hurt me and I just couldn\u2019t deal with it. So I sent the email without giving it much thought beyond not wanting my credit to get messed up. My friends and family are telling me it\u2019s not on me, but I\u2019d like to hear some unbiased perspective.", "created_utc": 1687987759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14llqse/aita_for_leaving_ex_without_a_place_to_stay/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you purposely didn't CC him because you were hurt which indicate you kinda knew what you were doing. I understand that you were angry but to me that seems a little over the line.\n\nOn the other hand, he is an adult and absolutely should have taken the initiative to ensure his lease situation was understood before the day of the lease ending.", "ESH ('cept leasing office. WOW! A situation where the landlord is not TA.)\n\nYou for not cc'ing your roommate, informing them that you were sending in the notice of non-renewal.

Then let the hate dissipate into nothing.", "I'm sorry but you needed to either CC him on that email or have someone tell him for you because your no overrode his ability to stay there. Even just saying you broke up might have been enough for the leasing agent to talk to him to see if he was interested in a lease just for him\n\nY T A, but I'm apologizing because the situation sounds like one where you did the right thing for you & it may have been a justifiable AH move.\n\nLike, if your friends & family don't think you should feel bad then I suspect what he did is kinda awful and you really should accept what you did as the right decision for your own well-being\n\nEdit: based on additional info you're 100% NTA", "NTA\n\nOnce you broke up, all obligations to him ceased.", "probably not going to be agreed with but NTA the only info he gave you was that he was gonna move out and you never heard different, had he told you and you did this anyway that\u2019s a different answer. You both were on the lease you both had equal responsibility to renew or terminate your end of the lease, you made sure to take care of yourself and not renew. He knew when the lease was ending and he knew he had to contact management to let them know his plans of either staying or leaving. He is a grown ass man and phones and internet work both ways, he could have reach out to them and/or you at any time to let people know his arrangements and he didn\u2019t, it\u2019s not up to management or an ex gf (op) to ask him. Y\u2019all sound like the kids in highschool who got mad when they weren\u2019t reminded of an assignment everyday then failed in when it wasn\u2019t turned in. He should\u2019ve  taken accountability of his own life. you should also take into account he hasn\u2019t even contacted you angry with you for this for all you know he\u2019s figured it out, stop overthinking and live your free life.", "INFO: Were both of your names on the lease?", "NTA.  He was just as capable as you of sending an email, making a call, doing something to make sure he still had a place.", "This has nothing to do with you.

I understand why you feel a bit shit about it, but ultimately you guys aren't together and you're removed from the situation now.", "I don\u2019t know if YTA exactly but I absolutely think you should\u2019ve informed him when you gave notice, just as a perfunctory courtesy", "INFO: what did the lease say would happen if you didn't communicate with them at all? \n\nIt's been a while since I rented but all my leases said that if you didn't explicitly communicate you were going to renew the lease 60 days beforehand, the lease would terminate at the end.", "NTA.\n\nApparently, in the partnership, you took care of the 'domestic' details.\n\nOnce the two of you broke up, he had to take on HIS OWN 'domestic' details.", "NTA - At 30 he is considered a grown ass man and should be able to take care of his housing situation himself.  You shouldn\u2019t have had to remind that he needed to speak to the leasing office.", "INFO\n\nAm I reading this correctly, that after you moved out, your ex didn't contact the leasing agents? At all, not even to renew a tenancy agreement? But waited until they contacted him about whether he was staying or leaving?\n\nYou contacted the leasing agents to inform them you was not going to renew a tenancy with them so your credit wouldn't be effected after the end of tenancy, you moved out before the end of the tenancy because I imagine you wanted to live apart from you ex as soon as possible... but even when you moved out he still didn't make his own arrangements with the leasing agency?!\n\nIf so... NTA... he didn't need to be CC to the emails, he should know when his joint lease was ending and that you was no longer going to live together and would have had to have emailed/called the leasing agency to make a new tenancy agreement, not assume a roll over month to month.\n\nDid he just assume you wouldn't end the joint tenancy? The man is 30, his incompetence is his own problem.\n\nEdited to add, he said he was going to down size at the end of the lease because you two were separated, so even if you hadn't emailed the leasing agency, he still would have had to because his plan was to move out also and would need to give them the 60days notice prior to the expiration date of the tenancy agreement...\n\nI'm starting to see why you walked away OP...", "NTA. Considering you signed it together should've CC'd him but the moment you moved out it became his responsibility. He has had plenty of time to take care of it, 100% not on you.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Maybe NAH. Ex should have been looking for a place or renewed. It sounds like the property manager will probably stick him in another unit so he won't be homeless at least.", "Nta. When you moved out it was on him to have you removed from lease and express a desire whether he would remain past term or not. He didn't communicate with property management- that's a him problem not a you responsibility.", "You should\u2019ve CC\u2019d him when you sent the email but he also should have reached out but YTA if he\u2019s going to suddenly be homeless because you kept him out of the loop", "YTA for not CCing him.\n\nI cannot imagine ending someone else\u2019s housing contract without having the decency to tell them.  \n\nAt least you don\u2019t have to worry that he will ever try to get back together with you.", "NTA.

NTA", "Leaning YTA.\nYes, your ex should've looked into this way sooner, but you canceled the lease on his behalf without telling him. Colossal asshole move.", "NTA. Your ex told you he was planning on moving. There was no reason for him to expect you to stay on the lease, keeping your credit tied into it. Once you moved out, it was on him to contact the landlord and inform them of the situation, expressing his preference to continue on a month-to-month basis. My guess is, his credit score isn't good enough for him to have kept the apartment on his own, and he was hoping to keep you involved with the lease for that reason. \n\nI guess it would have been nice to tell him about it, but you didn't owe it to him in any way. I don't know what he did to make you want to break contact completely, but I guess he wasn't that nice to you either.", "YTA.

You both need to take responsibility for your actions.", "YTA\n\nYou sent a notice to the leasing office that the apartment would be vacated by you AND your ex without telling your ex. You represented your ex without telling him.\n\nIf you weren't going to include him on that email, or otherwise loop him in, you should have told the leasing office that you have already moved out, don't want to be included on the next lease, and that they should get in touch with your ex.\n\nHe probably assumed that since he hadn't given his notice to move out that he had a place to live.", "NTA - you\u2019re not his mom, he\u2019s a grown a$$ man", "YTA- You can still be done with someone but say \"hey, I gave notice for us\".   \nIm not sure why when you gave notice you didn't clarify only you were moving out. You speak of wanting to be done with him and Just looking out for yourself yet intentionally failed to mention only you were moving out like a normal adult would.   \nHe's an adult and could have given his own notice or be stuck with the consequences of not. This seems like an intentional head game you played.", "YTA\n\nWhen you gave notice you should have specified that you have already moved out and there was one tenant remaining that you do not speak for and is not connected to your credit. I don't think you owe your ex anything but I do think in terms of being a good tenant you should have let the leasing office know what was going on prior to move out day. You inconvenienced them and possibly future tenants for r/pettyrevenge against your ex.", "Yta. If you gave notice neither of you would be renewing that is speaking for someone you shouldn\u2019t have. If you sent mail that you would not be renewing as you had left the property but were unsure of the intentions of the other leasee that becomes something between them.", "YTA\n\nYou canceled the lease and didn\u2019t tell him. I understand why you canceled, but as far as he knew the lease was set to be renewed, and he was still occupying the apartment.\n\nThat said, I think he may still have some right to the apartment, since he didn\u2019t specifically give notice, and is still the occupant. They sort of opened themselves up to trouble by not confirming with all parties on the lease. So at worst case they will need to go through eviction proceedings to force him out - and that takes time. He can stay until he finds a new place.", "YTA. You really should have CC'd him.", "I can see why you're not on good terms - you didn't even have the decency to let him know you were giving notice? Completely selfish AH.\n\nYTA", "He had no idea you'd given notice. He apparently did not contact the leasing office. The leasing office did not contact him. \n\nThat he left it until the end of the lease agreement to even think about switching to a monthly lease suggests he wasn't even thinking about it.\n\nYou could have informed the leasing agent that you wanted to be removed from the lease rather than unilaterally giving notice.\n\nEveryone Sucks Here.", "YTA - even though i hate to say that.  i understand your position, i've been in a similar position.  but tbh, it probably would've been a good idea to let him know you gave notice, just so he can plan accordingly (common courtesy), and so that wouldn't cause further conflict between the two of you.  i really do understand why you did it, you did what you needed to do in the moment to protect your peace, but just be prepared for some possible backlash from him about it.", "You were entitled to give notice for yourself but you should have let him know what you had done if it affected his position, which clearly it did.\n\nWas there a part of you that did this deliberately?\n\nBut then he is an adult and should have checked.\n\nESH", "ESH. You both should\u2019ve been able to communicate with eachother. You should\u2019ve CC\u2019d him into the email or told him you were going to ask to terminate the lease. He should\u2019ve told you and communicated with the property manager he changed his plans and was going to stay. \n\nI know it\u2019s difficult when you breakup on bad terms but unfortunately you still need to be able to be civil enough to work things such as this out. Otherwise you only screw yourself over.", ">Before I moved out, he told me that he was probably going to be moving into a cheaper place closer to his work once the lease ended\n\nThis is not a confirmation he'll be moving.\n\nYou should not have sent that e-mail without his knowledge, especcially if both of your names are on the lease. I would also not be so confident he will secure month-to-month housing in the same area. Sounds like the landlord quickly found tennants for your former apartment and month-to-month leasing is pretty rare, at least in my city.\n\nSince you don't talk to him anymore, its hard to know his side of the story in the lead up to move out day. But it sounds like he knew when the lease expires and if he wanted to stay he needed to confirm with the landlord, so he bares some responsibility for not taking action.\n\nI want to say ESH, but there's not enough info about the boyfriends actions. YTA.\n\nquick edit: I also don't get the part about having your credit get screwed up. If he wanted to renew, all the landlord would have to do is take your name off of the lease. You could have sent an email along the lines of \"I'm moving out once the lease ends, but ex-bf is renewing, please remove my name from the lease for the upcoming lease term\".", "YTA. You sort of just spoke for both of you without including him and then peaced out, not leaving the decision open for him to make. He was probably mulling it over and maybe taking more time to find a new place, and now doesn't have that option because of you. You should have just gone into the office and explained, and they would have gotten a hold of him that day and asked him about what his plans were and it would have been sorted out. Understandable though, since you really don't think clearly in these situations and typically just want out asap.", "YTA maybe not intentionally but def a dick move", "(EDITED TO ADD: NTA due to OP clarification, the leasing office screwed up here)- You told the leasing office you both were moving out. You didn't have the right to make the decision for him unilaterally. The correct thing to do, even if you didn't want to CC him on it, was to tell them \"I'm moving out now, and I will not be renewing, I do not know what he is doing\" or something similar.\n\nI also have a hard time believing that you didn't know that you were leaving him that nice little time bomb.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You spoke for both of you when you in fact were not together. Since you both signed the lease, it's up to you to speak for yourself and not for the other person in this situation. \n\nYTA for speaking on his behalf when you had no place in doing that.

The lease (commitment of payment through a certain date) was up and would've then converted to month to month rental agreement (same stipulations - in perpetuity) in which the property management would either leave it or make the current tenant (your ex) sign a new lease.  By telling the property management that BOTH of you would not be renewing, you essentially stated you're moving out. \n\nRegardless of what he said he may be doing you had no right to legally speak for him. The fact that he had no idea is really shitty. If he is forced to move out those expenses could become your expenses, should he decide to sue, because, again, you acted on his behalf without his consent, and the kicker is you failed to notify him. \n\nAnd for those saying he's an adult and should've checked, why? If the when the lease ends and the terms change to \"month-to-month\" he was well within his rights to expect that being the case....maybe if someone hadn't \"illegally\" spoken on his behalf, or informed him so he could address it, he wouldn't have had the rug pulled out from underneath him.", "Esh.

Your email should have said that you individually weren't renewing but that you had broken up and moved out and you did not know what your ex's plans were. Then left him and the leasing company to sort it out. \n\nHe does have some responsibility though for not contacting the agency if you're somewhere where the lease doesn't automatically renew/turn to month-to-month.\n\nBut I wouldn't beat yourself up about it or engage with him about it.

You don't owe him anything.", "YTA\n\nIt seems you are the asshole unless there is something in that letter that absolves you, eg letting the landlord know that the notice is only from yourself and not from your ex. \n\nYou could have very easily informed your ex or at least CC'd him into the email so he could have contacted the landlord and informed them of his own situation and intention. \n\nYou gave 60 days notice. Not once in that 60 days did you inform your ex. \n\nI'm assuming that once you moved out, your ex was paying the rent and you had nothing to do with the property anymore. \n\nWhy didn't you inform the landlord that it was only you giving the notice? Or did you?\n\nYou are definitely the asshole.", "But if he also signed the lease shouldn't he have gotten an email from the leasing office as well? Since OP was the only one to receive the email, I thought the lease was in her name only.", "Unless you live in a very popular area I doubt anyone would lock themselves in a lease without seeing the property. \n\nAlso the assumption is again they managed to lease it to the 1st person who enquired?\n\nBut at the end of the day, its nothing to do with you.  Your relationship was over at that point. Its his responsibility to sort himself out.", "With my current apartment, they were already looking for new tenants before the former tenants moved out, that's why they told us they couldn't show us the unit for a little bit. However, once the old tenants were gone, we were allowed to tour it, and then we signed the lease that very day. I sometimes wonder if the old tenants even knew they were being kicked out, because when we toured, it looks like maintenance was in the process of cleaning up stuff left behind. Not major stuff, but little things.", "Depends on the size of the complex. The one I rented sight unseen had model apartments so you could see the layout.", "He needed to sort out being the only person on the lease, he couldn't roll over to month to month with you not on the lease anymore, he would have needed to sign a new lease without you.\n\nHe was planning on keeping you on the month to month lease."]}
