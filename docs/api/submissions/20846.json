{"id": 20846, "submission_id": "14llqse", "title": "AITA for leaving ex without a place to stay?", "selftext": "Okay the title isn\u2019t exactly the situation but I wasn\u2019t sure how to sum it up. So basically my ex (30m) and I (27f) signed a year lease, it was set to end today. We broke up in February and I moved out at the end of March. We didn\u2019t end on good terms and we don\u2019t talk anymore. \n\nBefore I moved out, he told me that he was probably going to be moving into a cheaper place closer to his work once the lease ended. That\u2019s the only information I had about his plans. Our leasing office requires 60 days notice and that 60 day mark was quickly approaching. By the time it came around, things between us were not good. I wasn\u2019t willing to leave it up to him to give notice because my credit is on the line so I went ahead and sent an email that we wouldn\u2019t be renewing. I didn\u2019t CC him in this email so he had no clue I gave notice. \n\nI moved out and we haven\u2019t spoken since. Today is the day the lease ends and he\u2019s meant to be moving out. The leasing manager called me and asked what time we would be turning in our keys. I explained the situation, that we broke up and I have been moved out and that he definitely knew the lease was up at the end of June but I had no idea what his plans were. She told me that I guess he (my ex) told the maintenance manager today that he wanted to switch to a month to month lease. The problem is that because I gave notice, they went ahead and leased the apartment to someone else already. She was going to call him as soon as we hung up and said she\u2019d call me later with an update. \n\nPart of me feels like once I moved out and we were no longer talking, he should\u2019ve called the leasing office to at least figure everything out. At the very least to find out more info on switching from a set lease to a month to month deal. But the bigger part of me that unfortunately still loves him, despite how much he hurt me, feels really guilty that I didn\u2019t remind him the lease was ending and let him know I gave notice. Honestly the day I moved out, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about it.\n\nAITA for this? When I gave notice, I didn\u2019t CC him because some things had happened that really hurt me and I just couldn\u2019t deal with it. So I sent the email without giving it much thought beyond not wanting my credit to get messed up. My friends and family are telling me it\u2019s not on me, but I\u2019d like to hear some unbiased perspective.", "created_utc": 1687987759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14llqse/aita_for_leaving_ex_without_a_place_to_stay/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

WOW! A situation where the landlord is not TA.)\n\nYou for not cc'ing your roommate, informing them that you were sending in the notice of non-renewal.

Then let the hate dissipate into nothing.", "I'm sorry but you needed to either CC him on that email or have someone tell him for you because your no overrode his ability to stay there. Even just saying you broke up might have been enough for the leasing agent to talk to him to see if he was interested in a lease just for him\n\nY T A, but I'm apologizing because the situation sounds like one where you did the right thing for you & it may have been a justifiable AH move.\n\nLike, if your friends & family don't think you should feel bad then I suspect what he did is kinda awful and you really should accept what you did as the right decision for your own well-being\n\nEdit: based on additional info you're 100% NTA", "NTA\n\nOnce you broke up, all obligations to him ceased.", "probably not going to be agreed with but NTA the only info he gave you was that he was gonna move out and you never heard different, had he told you and you did this anyway that\u2019s a different answer. You both were on the lease you both had equal responsibility to renew or terminate your end of the lease, you made sure to take care of yourself and not renew. He knew when the lease was ending and he knew he had to contact management to let them know his plans of either staying or leaving. He is a grown ass man and phones and internet work both ways, he could have reach out to them and/or you at any time to let people know his arrangements and he didn\u2019t, it\u2019s not up to management or an ex gf (op) to ask him. Y\u2019all sound like the kids in highschool who got mad when they weren\u2019t reminded of an assignment everyday then failed in when it wasn\u2019t turned in. He should\u2019ve  taken accountability of his own life. you should also take into account he hasn\u2019t even contacted you angry with you for this for all you know he\u2019s figured it out, stop overthinking and live your free life.", "INFO: Were both of your names on the lease?", "NTA.  He was just as capable as you of sending an email, making a call, doing something to make sure he still had a place.", "This has nothing to do with you. This is between the property manager and your ex now. Your ex is an adult, the property manager and him can work it out. I understand why you feel a bit shit about it, but ultimately you guys aren't together and you're removed from the situation now.", "I don\u2019t know if YTA exactly but I absolutely think you should\u2019ve informed him when you gave notice, just as a perfunctory courtesy", "INFO: what did the lease say would happen if you didn't communicate with them at all? \n\nIt's been a while since I rented but all my leases said that if you didn't explicitly communicate you were going to renew the lease 60 days beforehand, the lease would terminate at the end.", "NTA.\n\nApparently, in the partnership, you took care of the 'domestic' details.\n\nOnce the two of you broke up, he had to take on HIS OWN 'domestic' details.", "NTA - At 30 he is considered a grown ass man and should be able to take care of his housing situation himself.  You shouldn\u2019t have had to remind that he needed to speak to the leasing office.", "INFO\n\nAm I reading this correctly, that after you moved out, your ex didn't contact the leasing agents? At all, not even to renew a tenancy agreement? But waited until they contacted him about whether he was staying or leaving?\n\nYou contacted the leasing agents to inform them you was not going to renew a tenancy with them so your credit wouldn't be effected after the end of tenancy, you moved out before the end of the tenancy because I imagine you wanted to live apart from you ex as soon as possible... but even when you moved out he still didn't make his own arrangements with the leasing agency?!\n\nIf so... NTA... he didn't need to be CC to the emails, he should know when his joint lease was ending and that you was no longer going to live together and would have had to have emailed/called the leasing agency to make a new tenancy agreement, not assume a roll over month to month.\n\nDid he just assume you wouldn't end the joint tenancy? The man is 30, his incompetence is his own problem.\n\nEdited to add, he said he was going to down size at the end of the lease because you two were separated, so even if you hadn't emailed the leasing agency, he still would have had to because his plan was to move out also and would need to give them the 60days notice prior to the expiration date of the tenancy agreement...\n\nI'm starting to see why you walked away OP...", "NTA. Considering you signed it together should've CC'd him but the moment you moved out it became his responsibility. He has had plenty of time to take care of it, 100% not on you.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Maybe NAH. Ex should have been looking for a place or renewed. It sounds like the property manager will probably stick him in another unit so he won't be homeless at least.", "Nta. When you moved out it was on him to have you removed from lease and express a desire whether he would remain past term or not. He didn't communicate with property management- that's a him problem not a you responsibility.", "You should\u2019ve CC\u2019d him when you sent the email but he also should have reached out but YTA if he\u2019s going to suddenly be homeless because you kept him out of the loop", "YTA for not CCing him.\n\nI cannot imagine ending someone else\u2019s housing contract without having the decency to tell them.  \n\nAt least you don\u2019t have to worry that he will ever try to get back together with you.", "NTA.

He should have been an adult as well, instead he waited until the last moment to talk to them about renewing the lease.   This is not your fault or responsibility!  NTA", "Leaning YTA.\nYes, your ex should've looked into this way sooner, but you canceled the lease on his behalf without telling him. Colossal asshole move.", "NTA. Your ex told you he was planning on moving. There was no reason for him to expect you to stay on the lease, keeping your credit tied into it. Once you moved out, it was on him to contact the landlord and inform them of the situation, expressing his preference to continue on a month-to-month basis. My guess is, his credit score isn't good enough for him to have kept the apartment on his own, and he was hoping to keep you involved with the lease for that reason. \n\nI guess it would have been nice to tell him about it, but you didn't owe it to him in any way. I don't know what he did to make you want to break contact completely, but I guess he wasn't that nice to you either.", "YTA.

You both need to take responsibility for your actions.", "YTA\n\nYou sent a notice to the leasing office that the apartment would be vacated by you AND your ex without telling your ex. You represented your ex without telling him.\n\nIf you weren't going to include him on that email, or otherwise loop him in, you should have told the leasing office that you have already moved out, don't want to be included on the next lease, and that they should get in touch with your ex.\n\nHe probably assumed that since he hadn't given his notice to move out that he had a place to live.", "NTA - you\u2019re not his mom, he\u2019s a grown a$$ man", "YTA- You can still be done with someone but say \"hey, I gave notice for us\".   \nIm not sure why when you gave notice you didn't clarify only you were moving out. You speak of wanting to be done with him and Just looking out for yourself yet intentionally failed to mention only you were moving out like a normal adult would.   \nHe's an adult and could have given his own notice or be stuck with the consequences of not. This seems like an intentional head game you played.", "YTA\n\nWhen you gave notice you should have specified that you have already moved out and there was one tenant remaining that you do not speak for and is not connected to your credit. I don't think you owe your ex anything but I do think in terms of being a good tenant you should have let the leasing office know what was going on prior to move out day. You inconvenienced them and possibly future tenants for r/pettyrevenge against your ex.", "Yta. If you gave notice neither of you would be renewing that is speaking for someone you shouldn\u2019t have. If you sent mail that you would not be renewing as you had left the property but were unsure of the intentions of the other leasee that becomes something between them.", "YTA\n\nYou canceled the lease and didn\u2019t tell him. I understand why you canceled, but as far as he knew the lease was set to be renewed, and he was still occupying the apartment.\n\nThat said, I think he may still have some right to the apartment, since he didn\u2019t specifically give notice, and is still the occupant. They sort of opened themselves up to trouble by not confirming with all parties on the lease. So at worst case they will need to go through eviction proceedings to force him out - and that takes time. He can stay until he finds a new place.", "YTA. You really should have CC'd him.", "I can see why you're not on good terms - you didn't even have the decency to let him know you were giving notice? Completely selfish AH.\n\nYTA", "He had no idea you'd given notice. He apparently did not contact the leasing office. The leasing office did not contact him. \n\nThat he left it until the end of the lease agreement to even think about switching to a monthly lease suggests he wasn't even thinking about it.\n\nYou could have informed the leasing agent that you wanted to be removed from the lease rather than unilaterally giving notice.\n\nEveryone Sucks Here.", "YTA - even though i hate to say that.  i understand your position, i've been in a similar position.  but tbh, it probably would've been a good idea to let him know you gave notice, just so he can plan accordingly (common courtesy), and so that wouldn't cause further conflict between the two of you.  i really do understand why you did it, you did what you needed to do in the moment to protect your peace, but just be prepared for some possible backlash from him about it.", "You were entitled to give notice for yourself but you should have let him know what you had done if it affected his position, which clearly it did.\n\nWas there a part of you that did this deliberately?\n\nBut then he is an adult and should have checked.\n\nESH", "ESH. You both should\u2019ve been able to communicate with eachother. You should\u2019ve CC\u2019d him into the email or told him you were going to ask to terminate the lease. He should\u2019ve told you and communicated with the property manager he changed his plans and was going to stay. \n\nI know it\u2019s difficult when you breakup on bad terms but unfortunately you still need to be able to be civil enough to work things such as this out. Otherwise you only screw yourself over.", ">Before I moved out, he told me that he was probably going to be moving into a cheaper place closer to his work once the lease ended\n\nThis is not a confirmation he'll be moving.\n\nYou should not have sent that e-mail without his knowledge, especcially if both of your names are on the lease. I would also not be so confident he will secure month-to-month housing in the same area. Sounds like the landlord quickly found tennants for your former apartment and month-to-month leasing is pretty rare, at least in my city.\n\nSince you don't talk to him anymore, its hard to know his side of the story in the lead up to move out day. But it sounds like he knew when the lease expires and if he wanted to stay he needed to confirm with the landlord, so he bares some responsibility for not taking action.\n\nI want to say ESH, but there's not enough info about the boyfriends actions. YTA.\n\nquick edit: I also don't get the part about having your credit get screwed up. If he wanted to renew, all the landlord would have to do is take your name off of the lease. You could have sent an email along the lines of \"I'm moving out once the lease ends, but ex-bf is renewing, please remove my name from the lease for the upcoming lease term\".", "YTA. You sort of just spoke for both of you without including him and then peaced out, not leaving the decision open for him to make. He was probably mulling it over and maybe taking more time to find a new place, and now doesn't have that option because of you. You should have just gone into the office and explained, and they would have gotten a hold of him that day and asked him about what his plans were and it would have been sorted out. Understandable though, since you really don't think clearly in these situations and typically just want out asap.", "YTA maybe not intentionally but def a dick move", "YTA - You told the leasing office you both were moving out. You didn't have the right to make the decision for him unilaterally. The correct thing to do, even if you didn't want to CC him on it, was to tell them \"I'm moving out now, and I will not be renewing, I do not know what he is doing\" or something similar. \n\nI also have a hard time believing that you didn't know that you were leaving him that nice little time bomb.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He obviously knew I left, and he had told me he wasn\u2019t gonna stay so when I sent the email I was working off that info. \nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth mentioning that I also talked to the manager on the phone a couple of days after and explained the situation at that time as well, that we broke up and I left so I personally would not be renewing the lease and that I didn\u2019t think he was either. I kinda figured they\u2019d call him to confirm but I guess not.", "While I agree OP should have notified their ex what they were doing, I think it's far, far too much to call them completely selfish because we really don't know the details of why their relationship broken down and how safe it was for OP to contact the ex at that point. I also think it would in fact be reasonable to expect the ex contact the landlord independently if he wanted to take over the lease solo and go month-to-month.", "Do you have to \"give notice\" to an ex when you move out that you will not be renewing a lease for an apartment you moved out of?  I thought that would be pretty obvious from the fact that they broke up and she moved out.", "He was an idiot tho, she was an AH. \n\nNot an E S H situation.", "I explained it in a couple of other comments, I did speak to them on the phone a couple of days later and explained the situation. I said I personally would not be renewing and was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t either but couldn\u2019t say for sure. I figured they\u2019d call him to confirm but clearly they didn\u2019t", "I did do that. I explained the situation and told them I personally would not be renewing and was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t either but couldn\u2019t say for sure. My assumption was they would reach out to him to confirm. \n\nI mean you can believe what you want but no, that wasn\u2019t the case. After all he put me through, I still do not wish him the worst. He told me he wasn\u2019t gonna stay, the flyers the office left on our doorstep detailing new leases and the prices sat untouched on the counter for weeks.", "I left all the furniture behind, I didn\u2019t want any of it. Only my stuff was taken. \n\nAt the time I left everything as is because I just wanted to get out and away from him as quickly as possible but yeah in hindsight, I should\u2019ve removed myself.", "Yeah he definitely knew. They left flyers outside the door giving us the option of renewing and what the prices would be for various leases, including month to month. Those papers just sat on the counter for weeks so that coupled with him telling me he wasn\u2019t going to stay made me believe he was leaving when the lease ended.", "If his actions guaranteed that you guys would be on bad terms, then who cares what kind of position you put him in?", "At least he told you something.", "Ah, didn't see that sorry!\n\nGonna edit my answer then but if you told the agent what happened & even that you didn't know what he was doing you're def in the clear here.\n\nThey probably were going to treat it like a brand new lease rather than try to coordinate you coming in to sign paperwork to get off the lease and then just didn't contact him for whatever reason... But that ball was solidly not in your court anymore", "You\u2019re old enough to know though that if it\u2019s not in writing, it doesn\u2019t happen. Whatever they have written documentation of is what they will use. YTA for not cc-ing him and speaking on his behalf.", "An e-mail to the leasing office saying to remove your name off of the upcoming lease term would not have been difficult. You or him could have done that. You're only on the hook for the lease term that had just expired. \n\nIf anything leaving your ex high and dry and him not moving out on time while both your names are on that lease will likely damage your score and your landlord could report both of you for violating the terms of the lease.", "Yeah, I missed the part that said \u201cwe\u201d wouldn\u2019t be renewing. Totally thought it said I.", "Yeah, obviously once you talked, and especially once you moved out, he should\u2019ve been on top of his shit, but generally an asshole move imo to make calls like that without telling a roommate. Though I sympathize with your reasons", "Best course of action would\u2019ve been saying you weren\u2019t renewing, but letting them know you weren\u2019t a package deal. You said \u201cwe\u201d, there was no we. And you knew his mind wasn\u2019t made up.", "That's the thing. The lease did not get cancelled. The last day of the signed lease came. If you don't RENEW you are supposed to send a notice 60 days in advance. Then you have to sign a new lease. He should have been an adult and known when his current lease ended. Especially since they usually jack up the rate for a month to month vs a longer term.", "''he told me that he was probably going to be moving into a cheaper place closer to his work once the lease ended''\n\nIts in there.", "Even so, you still didn't have the right to make that decision for him. You had no idea whether or not he was renewing, so you should have been honest with the leasing office and told them that you were not staying, and did not know whether he was or was not.", "But had she just gone in and explained it instead of just making that decision for him, it could have all been avoided. They would ahve asked him about it themselves and he could have sorted it out. But she took that decision away and then left it as a surprise to him at the end. I get that he should have been more proactive, but it could have been avoided.", "I still say that she was a small AH for not letting him know that he needed to contact them himself ASAP when she sent the email.  But ESH as he is a bigger AH for expecting that he could extend a lease with her name on it to month to month.", "I mean whatever if he\u2019s not gonna end up on the street I wouldn\u2019t worry about it he should\u2019ve been more in top of it", "I know you don\u2019t.  I wasn\u2019t being sarcastic.  \n\nOf course he assumed it would roll over to month to month.  That is what happens when you don\u2019t renew or decline to renew a lease.\n\nWhy would he have he expected that you would have terminated his contract without telling him?", "\"How upset I was\" is never an excuse.\n\nYou are an asshole even for using this phrase as a justification.", "Don't. You need to take care of yourself. He's a grown man who shouldn't need reminding that his lease is expiring.", "You told the landlord that the lease wouldn't be renewed. That means they're immediately going to start searching for new tenants. You set your ex up for failure and you knew it.", "You gave notice the lease would not be renewed - aka canceled. Arguing semantics here I think.\n\nI agree the manager is also at fault here, but it still sounds like you spoke for him, and didn\u2019t tell him.", "She doesn't mention safety at all but I'm sure she can fill us in if that was a factor.", "[deleted]", "I was curious with the email sent 60 days ago did you say we or I won\u2019t be renewing. If you talked with them after and specifically stated I then it would have been up to him to be a grown up and contact the leasing agent. Thanks!", "Nah you\u2019re good, there\u2019s a lot to keep up with lol\n\nTo be fair I moved 3 hours away so coming in wasn\u2019t really an option but yeah, the thought of this happening and him left scrambling never even crossed my mind. It wasn\u2019t deliberate, it wasn\u2019t revenge, it genuinely didn\u2019t even occur to me that they wouldn\u2019t contact him. And having no contact with him, I assumed he was moving out as he said he was going to.", "Yeah it was just a shitty situation all around, I absolutely didn\u2019t want to be on bad terms but that\u2019s just unfortunately how it ended.", "Ok. That doesn't mean the ex canceled his own lease. OP had no business submitting paperwork on behalf of the ex.", "I did, I told them that in a phone call a couple of days after I sent the email. I explained the situation and that I had left and would personally not be renewing, and I was pretty sure he wasn\u2019t either but I couldn\u2019t say for sure. I thought they\u2019d call to confirm but apparently not", "She didnt take any decisions or opportunities away from him at all, he did it himself. OP was responsible enough to handle her side of things (even though she wasn\u2019t even living there anymore) so why wouldnt her ex be expected to do the same? All it would have taken was a simple phone call to management on his part, he did know when the lease expired after all.", "How is babysitting her ex her responsibility in any way though? What makes her even a small AH? If she, while not even living there anymore, can remember to complete the end of lease process correctly then why cant he make a single phone call at any point to make sure he was allowed to stay there past the end of the lease if thats what he wanted? He knew when the lease ended. He just wasnt smart / responsible enough to think about it\u2026. maybe things like this contributed to the end of the relationship in the first place. who knows", "No for sure he won\u2019t end up on the street. I can confidently say that.", "Because if he actually was being responsible and not trying to screw her over he would have asked about removing her from the lease.  Auto rollover assumes that all signees are rolling it over.", "Thank you\ud83e\udd0d", "Oh sorry I thought you meant I cancelled early or something, my bad", "Ok, if I ever leave a \"housemate\" in the future, I will be extra sure to specifically tell them that by moving out I will not be living with them, and they should probably sort out the landlord situation on their own.", "Okay I went back to check and yeah, the email said we but in the phone call I made it clear that I personally would not be renewing and couldn\u2019t say for sure what he was gonna do.", "What is your point in arguing here?\n\nI already said she should have CC'd.", "Good.  Now block him.", "In the place I just moved from last year, if a resident does not renew their lease they automatically became holdover tenants, which are month-to-month tenants who are still expected to comply with the terms of the original lease.  \n\nESH because your ex might have assume this was what was going to happen in his case.  He was an AH for just assuming that without ensuring that you had sent a notice not to renew. \n\nYTA sending that notice not to renew without letting him know via a simple cc.  That was really messed up, no matter how upset you were or how much he had hurt you.  You really did set your ex up for failure.  He should have been more responsible and not assumed he could stay month to month.", "Not trying to argue, just wanted to point out that OP acted on her ex's behalf without his consent.", "Why would she need his consent for a notice? Her name is on there and its not going to be so its not getting renewed.", "She would need his consent because his name is also on the lease? OP literally admits that she emailed the notice on his behalf.", "i feel poor communication and tit-for-tat nonsense was probably a running theme in this relationship"]}
