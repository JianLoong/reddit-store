Is it possible to think of some token gesture recognising her as your step mother and celebrating the relationship that you ACTUALLY have?  \n  \nMy SIL gave little flowers to family members to wear on their outfits (can't remember the proper name?), and included the groom's step mother in that. Just a sweet recognition that she was family. Family, not mother.  \n\nA gesture on your behalf does not have to be wedding related, that was just an example.  \n \nIt's your wedding and nobody gets to railroad that with their own issues, but pretending that an issue doesn't exist doesn't make it go away - perhaps if you pick the timeframe you can circumvent the drama?", "What if you posed it to her as: \"this is the speech dad prepared, no offense, but we all this isn't how I feel, and if you let him try to go through with it then there is no chance I'll ever have any kind of relationship with you.\" She might not be your mom, but she could be grandma to your kids in the future, and that would be the angle I would go with.", "Flowers worn pinned to the outfit are usually called a corsage, and that was a kind idea.", "Or \"I'm infected (by your Genetics)\" from Repo: The Genetic Opera.\n\nNTA OP", "r/SubsIFellFor\n\ndammit", "Ahh thank you, I thought that was a prom thing only x", "\"Shiloh, I'm your father!\"", "\"It's a thankless Job!\"", "NTA. If your dad is making your step-mom the center of his speech and not you or your new bride, then it's not your wedding anymore.", "NTA. You have every right to rescind your invitation for your father to give a speech. First, wedding speeches are meant to honor the newly married couple; your father\u2019s intent to talk about another  topic abuses your invitation. Second, your father apparently didn\u2019t plan to tell you what his true intentions were until you found out. Instead, he was just going to spring this on you. This abuses your trust. Third, your wedding is not the time and place for your father\u2019s agenda. And frankly, the status of your relationship with your step mother is really between the two of you\u2014not the two of you plus your dad (not to mention all your wedding guests).\n\nNot surprisingly, this sub is full of snarky suggestions for what you should do in response. But I urge you: DON\u2019T. Your post implies that the speech may have been entirely your dad\u2019s idea, and that you actually like and care for your step mother to a certain degree. You just aren\u2019t comfortable viewing her as the equivalent of \u201cmom\u201d\u2014a term you understandably feel has emotional significance. While it\u2019s okay to feel this way, dying on the hill of \u201cshe\u2019s not my mom\u201d may cause you to say some things that could be legitimately and unnecessarily hurtful to this \u201cnice\u201d woman, and which could disrespect the love, care and support she has shown you even though it has not been fully reciprocated. While you don\u2019t need to give into your father\u2019s insistence that your stepmom be \u201cmom\u201d, you also don\u2019t need to go out of your way to hurt her. Just politely reiterate to your father that he will no longer be permitted to give a speech, and take up the broader discussion another day. Then, perhaps schedule a special outing with just you and your step mom. Do thank her for all the love and support she\u2019s shown you. Do express your appreciation for her having helped to raise you. But do also be honest about why \u201cmom\u201d is a term that you prefer to reserve to your biological mother. You don\u2019t necessarily have to say \u201cI just don\u2019t connect with you in the same way.\u201d Just explain what your mom means to you and that you feel that giving her the exclusive privilege of being called \u201cmom\u201d by you honors her and your love for each other. \n\nWhen it comes to your wedding, it is okay to specially honor your mom, and to do so in a way that makes the irreplaceable love you have for her clear. But I might challenge you to consider whether there are ways to still acknowledge the support you have received from your stepmom in raising you for many years and for any assistance provided for the wedding. (I mean, you\u2019ll surely thank other non-parents who have have played a big role leading up to the day.)
