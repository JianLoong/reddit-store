Is it possible to think of some token gesture recognising her as your step mother and celebrating the relationship that you ACTUALLY have?  \n  \nMy SIL gave little flowers to family members to wear on their outfits (can't remember the proper name?), and included the groom's step mother in that. Just a sweet recognition that she was family. Family, not mother.  \n\nA gesture on your behalf does not have to be wedding related, that was just an example.  \n \nIt's your wedding and nobody gets to railroad that with their own issues, but pretending that an issue doesn't exist doesn't make it go away - perhaps if you pick the timeframe you can circumvent the drama?", "What if you posed it to her as: \"this is the speech dad prepared, no offense, but we all this isn't how I feel, and if you let him try to go through with it then there is no chance I'll ever have any kind of relationship with you.\" She might not be your mom, but she could be grandma to your kids in the future, and that would be the angle I would go with.", "Flowers worn pinned to the outfit are usually called a corsage, and that was a kind idea.", "Or \"I'm infected (by your Genetics)\" from Repo: The Genetic Opera.\n\nNTA OP", "r/SubsIFellFor\n\ndammit", "Ahh thank you, I thought that was a prom thing only x", "\"Shiloh, I'm your father!\"", "\"It's a thankless Job!\""]}
