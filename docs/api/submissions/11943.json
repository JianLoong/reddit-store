Besides, speeches during weddings were never supposed to be speeches in the first place! It was originally just a toast to the bride and groom! I used to help my mom organize weddings, and speeches are painful for everyone.", "NTA. Tell the DJ under no circumstance is anyone but the bride or groom to be given a mic and to pull the plug if dad touches it. Also, have a HUGE picture of your mother with a beautiful memorial to her front and center. Also, if you give a toast, make sure to mention your mother. I'm super petty, so I would be obnoxious about memorializing my mother, just to spite stepmom and dad.", "NTA, Jesus Christ...", "NTA - Gotta love these people who try to make other people\u2019s wedding about something other than the bride and groom. /s (and BIG eye roll)", "NTA. My brother died the year i got married. He was going to be my best man. My Dad wanted to give a speech.  It was going to be centered around my brother not being there. I said no. We had a small nice memorial set up near the altar to signify his presence. But a lot of guests didn\u2019t know and we felt this wasn\u2019t the appropriate place to talk about it. If they asked about the memorial I would tell them. He was mad, but I told him this wasn\u2019t about my brother no matter how much I would have given to have him there. He wasn\u2019t happy. But he also wasn\u2019t able to move the apotlight from the people the guests were there to celebrate and I hope you and your new bride have a great wedding!!\n\nLet him be mad.  It worked for me!", "NTA but your father certainly is for trying to make your wedding about his wife. Just tell your father that it's not his wedding she's not your mom and that you will not have your event hijacked because she feels insecure. And then tell him that if that is not acceptable then they do not need to attend.", "NTA, and thank your aunt for sending you the draft to vet. Also get buddies to usher him away from stage in case he causes a scene. Or uninvite him AND \u2018fake mom\u2019.", "NTA. Personally I would sit both your dad and your step mom down and explain to them very clearly, on no uncertain terms, that their behavior at your wedding will make or break your relationship with them going forward. Make it very clear that she will never be your mom, that she has never been your mom. And that you are not afraid to cut them out of your life permanently. If either of them tries to throw a fit during this conversation, immediately uninvite them from the wedding. Then, inform all of the proper personnel to make sure that they won't be able to sneak in and crash your wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding. You had a mother, she passed, and no one will replace her. You're dad is clearly trying to live out his life-long fantasy and denying the existence of his past wife (Sounds like he hasn't mourned properly) and is now trying to replace her with his current wife. \n\n\"Dad, Stepmom is NOT my mother. She was around for a long time, but she never was and never will be a replacement for my mom. I didn't get the option of having my mother for longer, and my mother didn't get the option of staying. So I am choosing to honor my mother by having her picture at (location: memorial table, seat of the mother of the groom, etc.). \n\nYou don't get to decide who my mother is. If anyone is acting like a controlling child, it's you. You need to come back to reality because anything outside of that is delusional. I think you're wife is a lovely person, but she hasn't and never will be my mother. You can praise your wife any other time as YOUR WIFE, but you don't get to speak on my behalf as to her relationship with me. Period. \n\nOnce again, that is delusional. \n\nSo, the speech is no longer on the table - and if you so much as attempt to try it, I will have you removed by security\\*. If that is too much for you to handle or understand, then you are welcome to stay home, but it will show me where your support lies and I will thoroughly reconsider my relationship with you. Now that my boundaries have been made known, you need to let me know if that is amiable or not.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*And I highly recommend you get a neutral hired third party to remove him if he does try - this is a private event, he doesn't get to do whatever he wants", "I'm sorry your dad sucks and can't respect you and feels that shining a light on his wife at YOUR wedding is somehow even remotely appropriate.

It's your wedding and his speech was highly inappropriate! NTA", "The wedding day is a spotlight on the couple themselves, not the parents.  I realize there are weddings where the parents push their way into the spotlight or have made the day actually about the, but it is a day for the couple.  NTA.  Your dad needs to accept your feelings about his wife and quit trying to force you to accept a label/title that you have not given to her.  \"Mom\" is an earned name and you've not felt stepmom has earned it.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding and his wife doesn\u2019t need to be recognized in any way. Your father not his wife has the right to force a relationship with her or to make you call her mom. No speech at your wedding and if he doesn\u2019t like it they don\u2019t have to come. If she wanted to be called mom they should have had a child or adopted one.", "NTA. You need to make sure he doesn't get the microphone. Honestly, it's appalling all these posts about people trying to hijack someone else's wedding day!", "How soon is the wedding? I would probably have a video of my mom played at some point before the speeches. Is this something you can do? You know those videos that tell the story of your mom with interviews of you and others like your aunt talking about her. You talk about how much you love her and miss her and how she was a wonderful mom. Basically a tribute to your mom. Doesn't have to be in video form. \n\nYour dad's speech after that would become pretty meaningless.", "NTA.  Sounds like he's uninviting himself.", "A wedding speech should be about the happy couple. This one is about your father's wife. \n\nThat is wholly inappropriate at a wedding and he is doing it to make a point. The fact that your aunt was concerned enough to send it says it all. NTA.", "NTA\n\nBehaving like a child would be letting your dad tell you what happens at your own wedding. If anything, you're being the adult by taking control of it.", "Nta, your weddings not the place or time for him to attempt to create a narrative that they want about life, I\u2019d likely disinvite him completely so no I don\u2019t think this is an overreaction by any means Nta but not your dad sure is", "If your dad wants to shine a light on his wife, let him raise his own party. This one is about your partner and you getting married, so the light should be on you. \nI would spell this out to him once again. If he still doesn\u2019t get it then, ask the aunt to talk some sense into your dad. After all, she got the first look on the speech, so there is some kind of relation between them. Maybe she can talk him into some sense. \n\nThe \u2018get late mam a chair\u2019 thing really appeals to me. If aunties influence and the sight of your memorial to your mam doesn\u2019t stop dad, then it\u2019s time for someone to step up to him at the wedding with a simpel message; don\u2019t speech or you\u2019ll get evicted. Preferable some professional like the wedding or event planner.", "NTA. There is a lot that could be said here but I'll keep it simple.

Let's talk about that for the next 10 minutes\"", "Good advice.", "That's actually brilliant, and IMHO, not at all petty! I'm serious, I think that the kill 'em with kindness route is often (not always\\*, but often) the best way to go, and your idea is being gracious to the stepmom, while also acknowledging OP's birth mom on his wedding day.

It hung on the back of the chair at the ceremony and then at a table during the reception. It was a sweet gesture to see a space saved for him, even though he couldn\u2019t be there in person. You could do something like that as well to honor your mom.", "I know it's  a long shot, but is there any chance that speaking to your stepmother will make a difference? You've said you respect and care for her as your dad's wife, so it seems you have a somewhat decent relationship. Would it help if you show her a copy of the speech and explain to her how this day, and any speeches, should be about YOU AND YOUR BRIDE, not about your family.

I bet OP appreciated how you were secure enough in your love and were willing to put OP first all these years by respecting his Mom. \n\nStep Mom:  Well, actually, I TOLD him he needs to forget that Dead Chick and treat ME like his Mom! Can you believe he keeps pulling this shit, even at his own wedding? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah.  That's not happening.  She's going to demure, say thank you, and move on. And if Dad gets up to give the speech he was planning to give after that.... wow.  That would be super embarrassing and tacky, especially if OP is classy and careful with what they say about Step Mom.   Dad, if he's been reasonable up to this point, will not give the speech after that.", "The way to deal with that is have a massive sign that says anyone tapping glasses for speeches will be shot, then arm the groomsmen and bridesmaids with paintball guns and tell them if they don't need to reload after they haven't fired enough", ">do the glass-tapping thing for attention \n\nFunny story and a complete aside, but at my maternal grandfather's wake last year, my kid ended up hitting a knife against a glass hard enough to trigger the entire group (about 50-75 people) to turn and look at him, while my cousins started shouting for a speech.

Also, the DJ (or band leader/MC, if it's a band) is the one who introduces the bridal party and the couple, if there's a grand entrance into the reception area.\n\nSo all that said, yes, OP should absolutely give their DJ a heads up that the father of the groom is not allowed to make a speech. We told the DJ at our wedding that no one was to give a speech other than the Best Man - period, no exceptions, because we had a couple of relatives who would have given VERY awkward speeches, if they were allowed to do so!\n\nThere's also always the option of asking the DJ to start playing a loud song that gets everyone dancing, if someone does try to take the spotlight/make a speech/gets drunk and wants to blab to the entire room about their transgressions, or those of the bride or groom.\n\n\\*Source: Former wedding coordinator.
