There are all sorts of baskets from free messages to gift cards to sports jerseys and so much more. Bracken got some tickets for all of the sports related ones, he plays baseball and has done this every year, and he\u2019s been pretty successful in the past. Bracken then went around with his gf. \r  \n\r  \nI was hanging out with my husband, sister and rest of the family while looking at the baskets, when Bracken and his gf came back to us. Shortly after this, while still looking at the baskets, we saw some science-y baskets, with projects and books for kids and adults. This type of stuff is what Neville likes, it was going fine until in that section, they had a few baskets that were aimed at girls in science/STEM. \r  \n\r  \nWhen Neville saw the baskets, he called them stupid and started making some pretty awful comments about how girls are \u201ctoo dumb\u201d for science and that\u2019s why they needed special baskets. He made some more comments like, \u201cthis is why robotics club is all boys\u201d. My husband and I just dismissed it, but we could see a few people giving us looks, and Bracken made a comment telling Neville to shut his mouth.\r  \n\r  \nThe raffle happened, Bracken won a lot, the rest of us didn\u2019t. On the car ride home, my hubby and I were asking each other where Neville could have learned that language and we were stumped.\r  \n\r  \nLast night, I got a call from my sister and she seemed stress, she was telling me about how horrible Neville\u2019s first month of middle school was. She was telling me he was being targeted and bullied. I asked her to explain what happened, and she was just crying, I asked if she could give the phone to someone else. She gave it to Bracken, who told us that she wasn\u2019t telling the truth. He said that kids were mocking Neville for what he said at the raffle. Bracken admitted he was telling his friends about it, who then spread it around to the 6th graders. Some of the kids in Neville\u2019s grade were calling him creepy and weird, and were doing it to his friends as well, who defended his comments. My sister quickly grabbed the phone from him after.\r  \n\r  \nAfter she calmed down, she asked me what to do. I told her that this was on her and her fault for not correcting Neville\u2019s behavior. She said that she didn\u2019t know why he said it, and said that she \u201ccan\u2019t just take away his phone or friends\u201d when I mentioned both as a possible source. She just doubled down and said she needed to \u201cteach Bracken and his friends not to gossip\u201d. I told her she was being ridiculous and hung up.

I'm sure he didn't realize how much it would affect his brother, or maybe he thought that this would \"wake him up\" and \"do him some good\", in a tough love way. Either way he's a child too, but he's also the older brother and he should understand that he can be an active and conscious good influence for his younger brother, or he can maybe stay out of the way a bit if he doesn't wanna do that.   \n\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers for this but it's a MUCH more complicated situation than \"who is the asshole\" (unless you wanna talk about sexist influencers or tech companies) but i think Neville deserves better than that.", "NTA\n\nWhat your sister is doing is pushing the responsibility of Neville's words onto other people, like Bracken, instead of keeping Neville accountable for them. This is step one of enabling his behavior; each time he's allowed to get away with it, he'll feel emboldened to do it again and get worse each time.  \n\nAsk me how I know. Actually, please don't ask. The person I know is almost 70 so it's an interminably long story.", "ESH (except Bracken)\n\nwe have a 11 year old falling into the misogynistic sexist rabbit hole. Poor parenting. No one including you, your husband, and his mom didn\u2019t say anything instead ignored his comment. I applaud Bracken for at least telling him to shut up.\n\nBracken ngl is the only one who made sure Neville knew what he said was wrong even if it caused bullying I bet Neville knows what he said was wrong now because of Bracken. I just see it as a bully learning his lesson. \n\nYour not wrong though your sister should\u2019ve put some sense in her kids head but at the same time you ignored what Neville said. Sure she\u2019s the parents but he needs to know everyone disapproves of his situation which includes you.", "INFO: Those are made up names, right?\n\nOn the actual question, NTA. She will have to rein him in, he is already a thoroughly unpleasant character and if she doesn't take action now, the likelihood of him improving is low. The consequence there will be that he will never be able to make friends or get along with other people. And if her own sister won't tell her, who will?", "ESH. You should have called out his comments immediately. Why would you just blow them off? You just allowed your nephew to act like a little asshole and stood by doing nothing. You left a child to correct his behavior. Your sister is an asshole for blaming her other son for this reaction. Only not asshole in this story is bracken. do better.", "ESH -Except for Bracken and maybe his girlfriend.\n\nBracken and his friends shouldn't gossip but plenty of other people  overheard his .  misogynistic comments.\n\n*My (26F) sister (33F) has 2 sons: Bracken (13M) and Neville (11M).

None of you mentioned how it is still hard for women in science and attitudes like his aren't helping the situation? That maybe there wouldn't be a need 'for special girl baskets' if everyone had a fair chance and were treated equally?\n\nNeville's parents need to get ahead of this and find out who he has been listening to on social media and in real life. Neville thinks girls are dumb- this attitude won't be limited to just girls and women in stem. He will carry it over into his 'relationships' with girls (he probably won't have many, though). It will be much harder to get rid of these attitudes when he is older so his mother and father need to start now.", "NTA \n\nNeville played stupid games and won stupid prizes. BTW, your sister\u2019s negligence will make things worse in the future for him if they don\u2019t nip this in the bud. Plus she\u2019s backwards for punishing her other son while he was being forthcoming to you on what\u2019s been happening with his brother at school. \n\nLooks to me that your sister has no resolve to make tough decisions on parenting (i.e. taking his phone away). No accountability. These are the makings of bullying all over.", "INFO: Why didn't you, as a responsible adult who was present, immediately shut down the sexist comments? They were said in front of you and they were offensive. Had a stranger said them it would have been appropriate to respond. But you let your nephew get away with it? ESH except big bro. Everyone else gets a big fail.", "NTA. Your sister needs to nip this in the bud quickly, because if this goes unchecked Neville is going to build himself a victim complex that's just going to make his behavior worse. It's a bit concerning that she's more worried about the gossip than Neville's misogyny, because ultimately what's happening is that he's facing social consequences for his actions/words. She definitely needs to address what's going on with Neville ASAP, because it seems like she's more concerned with shielding him from consequences than addressing the issue.", "NTA. \n\nNice to hear that the kids at school are aware of how inappropriate Neville's comments are and not afraid to call it out. Unlike the adults in his life.\n\nBy the way, your sister has the worst taste in kids' names.", "NTA. People use \u201cbullying\u201d claims as a way to control others.  He sounds like the bully.", "NTA so she will correct one child in the wrong but not the other??", "NTA. People need to step in like his brother and stop Neville now.", "NTA. She *is* being ridiculous. Neville had no qualms at all about making sexist comments loud enough that other people were giving him looks. It's not bullying for the other kids to not like him or tolerate his crap. And Bracken and his friends \"gossiping\" about behavior loudly displayed in public, is *not* the biggest problem your sister needs to address.", "So a bully is getting bullied back nope Nta at all", "And freaking Neville going on about women in STEM fields is the reason women sometimes don't follow STEM careers, because they have to put up with such sexist biased thinking from male peers.\n\nAnd it starts - about 6th or 7th grade! Before that age, girls actually outperform boys.\n\nThis is absolutely on your sister OP. If she's clueless about how to pursue such terrible thoughts and behaviors, she can ask friends or teachers or coworkers. I would be forcing Neville to write about 100 women in STEM. One paragraph each. He wouldn't get his phone at home until it was complete. I would also be putting parental controls on all electronics and checking his Internet search history and texts. He hasn't earned privacy at his age and it's obviously an issue.", "ESH. When he started to spew his sexist crap, he should have been shut down, whether it be from her, you or your hubby. At least 1 out of the 3 of you adults should have said something.", "NTA Your sister's problem became clear when she didn't want to discipline Neville in any way but to discipline Bracken instead.\n\nOf course, she should be disciplined for naming her son \"Bracken,\" but that's another post entirely.\n\nMother:  Where is Bracken?\n\nNeville: He's at the lake.  I think he's hiding in the bracken.", "Is Bracken a real name?", "ESH\n\nEvery single adult in this situation has had multiple times to educate/advocate but instead chose to ignore the comment and provide no learning opportunity.\n\nTherapy could be a great resource, since none of you adults want to actually be a proper adult / role model for this child.", "NTA But his behavior needs to be corrected quickly, I wonder why his brother tried to stop him in a way like this.  Your sister needs to parent.", "NTA,but you're also kind of assholish for not correcting Neville.", "Wondering who's modeling the sexism to Neville. It's curious  his mom sees nothing wrong with his attitude against women. Guess Neville''s the golden child. Poor Bracken.", "Kid isn\u2019t being bullied. He\u2019s experiencing the natural consequences of his actions. \n\nThe last thing he needs is to be treated like a victim. He acted like an asshole, he\u2019s being treated like an asshole. Parents need to tell him straight up that if he wants to be treated like a decent person, he\u2019ll have to act like a decent person. The end.", "NTA, Bracken did spread the news but it was an accident and it wouldn't have happened if Neville didn't act the way he did. His mom clearly doesn't see what is wrong with Neville's thoughts and actions. She did not teach him well. You should talk to Neville and explain to him why his behavior was wrong. I know its not your kid but he needs to know before it gets worse.", "When kids hear us talk, they often times repeat what they've heard. Gossip is as gossip does, after all. It really ain't a deep construct. So, ensuring that kids don't gossip actually means we shouldn't give them anything to gossip about.\n\nNTA. Your sister's upset for her son's sake. And I get that part. But, thought policing all the other kids he knows won't actually resolve these problems. She'd do better to talk to Neville about his ideas about girls and women and math and science. Change his ideology and help him see a bigger picture and there will be less confusion and hostility among his peers. I'd call the school and ask for some mediation to help ALL the kids redirect.

I knew a lot of boys who were ostracized because of this behaviour.\n\nBack in highschool our teachers were calling out the girls in my grade because they believed we were bullying a boy by avoiding him, but in reality it was because he used to say shitty things just like your nephew, and would stalk and profess his love to every new girl in our grade, including me. When he ran out of girls in our grade he went on to target the younger grades. I was pretty cordial with him until he started to harass my younger sister, and other girls younger sisters.

A lot of young boys are falling down the well along with Sneako and Andrew Tate rhetorics.
