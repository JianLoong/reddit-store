{"id": 24615, "submission_id": "15qkjx5", "title": "AITA for embarrassing my ex at my brother's wedding?", "selftext": "Background: I (27F) have a daughter Eleanor (5F) her father (Nolan 30M) and I broke up 2 years ago after cheating on his end. We keep it civil, and I try to push my feelings aside for Eleanor's sake. \n\n\r  \nMy brother Josh got married this past month, and his at the time fiance had asked for Eleanor to be the flower girl. She was super excited about it, especially since she got to wear a beautiful dress for the occasion. At the ceremony, Eleanor was supposed to lay the flower petals, walk around the groomsmen in the first pew and sit with me in the second pew (The aisle was on the right side and I was sitting on the left side; the right side was saved for parents). \n\n\r  \nAt the ceremony, my daughter was doing so amazingly until she ran out of petals about midway thru the aisle. She stopped and looked around really confused. I honestly didn't know what do to since, if I were to get up I would either have to walk in front of the ceremony or walk from behind in front of my soon-to-be SIL. I was just about to get up, when one of Josh's groomsmen, Blake (28M) walked up to her, held out his hand, and led Eleanor in the direction she was supposed to go. Blake brought her to me, I thanked him, and the wedding continued on. \n\n\r  \nPresent: My SIL got her wedding pictures back and she's been posting them all over Instagram and Facebook. A couple of these pictures are of Blake holding Eleanor's hand walking down the aisle and walking up to me. My mother (Nolan has her on social media), took all the pictures of Eleanor to make one huge post of her. They of course included some of the pictures of her and Blake. Nolan screenshotted these pictures and sent me a text saying that I intentionally humiliated him. I told him I wouldn't do that to him on purpose and that Blake went on his own accord because I couldn't get to her without walking in front of everything and messing up my SIL's moment. Nolan won't listen to me, in his words, \"You made me look stupid in front of your family,\"\n\n\r  \nI feel guilty about this. I could've led Eleanor myself but I didn't and now Nolan is embarrassed because of me. My mother and Blake say I'm not an asshole but they have biases. I think I am the asshole, so I decided to post here to get unbiased and different opinions. I just want to know if I need to go out of my way to make a huge apology to Nolan since I want to remain civil for Eleanor's sake. AITA? \r  \n\r  \nI'm adding this for context since I feel that it should go toward my judgment. I've known Blake for a few years now, he and my brother are really close, and he shows up to family parties on occasion. Nolan knows him from these parties and others. At Josh's reception (I had Eleanor a babysitter pick her up after the ceremony) Blake and I did dance and spent most of the night together. My SIL posted a lot of pictures and there were pictures of us dancing and smiling together. I can be 100% sure but there is a chance Nolan saw these, and it could've affected his actions.

Was Nolan there? Doesn't sound like he was. So where is the embarrassment?", "100% NTA. The only person embarrassing Nolan right now is Nolan. He is acting like a child carrying a giant bag of insecurity and gaslighting you about it. He wasn\u2019t even at the wedding and somehow making this about him. It\u2019s as unbelievable as it is cliche and classically narcissistic behavior. You have ZERO to apologize for because you literally did nothing wrong here and have nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA - you didnt do anything, your ex is just hella insecure and taking it out on you.", "NTA. This had nothing to do with Nolan. Your daughter was a flower girl and got stuck after her petals ran out. A nearby groomsmen, who is a family friend, helped her out. Nolan could have helped her out, but cheated on you and ruined any chance of being at your sibling's wedding. \n\nSounds like Nolan is jealous that you might eventually move on from him and that would mean another man in your daughter's life. Nolan is the one who needs to work on himself to have a good co-parenting relationship. This is on him and not you. Hopefully you and your daughter had fun at the wedding.", "NTA - I do not understand how this could have embarrassed your ex at all. You should not feel guilty about this, and just keep telling him  you do not understand how he was embarrassed.", "Definitely NTA honestly it just sounds like he\u2019s jealous and maybe a bit possessive ( not that he has a leg to stand on considering he cheated) I mean without any context nice wedding grade pics of you dancing/hanging out with Blake and a cute picture with Eleanor and him in it may imply a more serious relationship between you and Blake. Sounds like he is just trying to guilt trip/ manipulate you into feeling bad about socialising with another guy which is absolutely none of his business as he cheated and you are broken up.\nSounds like he is TA. \n\nJust don\u2019t engage 100 bucks says since Blake is an old family friend he probably would accuse you of cheating when you were together its a classic cheaters move", "NTA. Blake helps Eleanor. SIL posts pictures. Mom reposts pics. Nolan\u2026 gets mad? Yeah, no. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If Nolan is embarrassed then it has something to do with his own insecurities about something.", "NTA.

He wasn't there, nobody cared about him, and all that happened was his daughter was guided down the aisle by a friendly guy. I mean, how is this about Nolan at all? Tell him to get over himself, nothing is about him, and if he really wants to be embarrassed, let it be over the fact that he's bizarrely inserted himself into a situation that has NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

You didn\u2019t embarrass him (that makes NO sense - how is a groomsman redirecting your daughter during his friend\u2019s wedding embarrassing? It\u2019s not.). He\u2019s mad because THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF AN ADORABLE AS FUCK ROMANCE NOVEL. \n\nIs there a thing between you and Blake?

There are very public photos of Blake with Eleanor and later Blake dancing with you. Everyone has seen these, and likely suspects you and Blake have something going on -- i.e., that Nolan has been replaced in your affections. That's why he is feeling embarrassed and humiliated. His character flaws are publicly front and center, because of his *absence* in these photos.\n\nNolan is a total asshole for blaming you for his feelings. It doesn't matter whether you and Blake are having a thing, you are NTA either way. **You have not done anything wrong, and you have nothing about which to feel guilty**.\n\nToo bad for Nolan. He cheated, he doesn't get a say in your life anymore -- and if he feels embarrassed and humiliated because you've been seen out enjoying yourself in the company of another man, that's his problem."]}
