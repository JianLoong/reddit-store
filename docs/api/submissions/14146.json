I think it's safe to say this pregnancy has been particularly hard on her. She has damn near constant migraines and almost always feels nauseous and miserable. I was originally doing all I could to provide comfort but I'm admittedly growing exhausted because some of the requests are ridiculous at best. Like she doesn't want me playing with the dog indoors because the dog is very high energy and my wife is getting fed up with the dog plowing through the house to play with me. She said the sound of the dogs nails against hard wood, barking/whining and hearing me sing to the dog is nauseating (I make up songs that incorporate my dogs name and I have ADHD so admittedly it gets loud at times) and gives her a migraine. It's reached a point where if the dog even goes near her she gets way too pissed off and has expressed she \"hates\" my dog and I need to stop \"forcing the dog on her\".\n\nI also like.. \"stim\" a lot and don't even realize it half the time. Like I will repeatedly tell my wife I love her in singing form and again, it can get pretty loud and it's absolutely repetitive and I don't even realize I'm doing it until she just kind of stops what she's doing and stares at me with that look of annoyance on her face. I'm not medicated for my ADHD, per choice, but I do my best to deal with it.\n\nWell this morning I was playing with the dog and I thought I was being quiet but apparently not. I walk in to the bedroom and see my wife packing a suitcase. I asked her what was going on and she said \"I'm leaving for awhile. You purposely being loud and obnoxious with that dog and the constant scream singing isn't something I'm willing to tolerate right now, especially after I've asked you to tone it down and unless I go away for awhile I will end up divorcing you because I honestly don't like you right now.\" She didn't say anything else. She just left. My buddy is saying I'm a dick, as he's been around when my wife's asked me to tone it down and even in his eyes it looks like I don't even try.

It doesn't matter that you claim not to realize it, you've been repeatedly told by multiple people.  You say you're doing your best to deal with your ADHD, but you're not really.

You are not able to control your repetitive behavior/stimming, perhaps because you are under stress with the pregnancy too.  \n\nHowever, unlike you, your wife has no choice what you do with your body, and by choosing to not medicate you are choosing for your wife too.\n\nI would reconsider medication, if only for while your wife is experiencing this difficult pregnancy. Then you could evaluate after the baby is here if you want to continue on with it.", "Yes, unfortunately YTA. As someone with ADHD and someone who has had a really rough pregnancy I can totally empathize with both sides here. It\u2019s HARD to regulate what\u2019s socially acceptable when you feel like you\u2019re acting socially acceptable already. However, if you can\u2019t control yourself enough to support your wife while she\u2019s pregnant and suffering, you\u2019re the asshole in the situation. \n\nYour wife isn\u2019t trying to be a dick. She finally snapped, you had warning.  Being ill while you\u2019re pregnant is a whole monster that you will never be able to truly understand. You need to accept that it is a million times worse then you think it is. If you\u2019ve never been so nauseous that sound or stimulation makes you want to die then you don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s real bad, dude. \n\nThe good thing is you don\u2019t have to get it! You have to try harder, cope better, and listen to your wife. You can do this ~ buy something you can stim with silently, have fun goofing off with your dog outside, go get your energy out somewhere else and make sure she\u2019s got water and anything she might want before you go. You got this!", "Yeeeeah YTA... Your struggle with ADHD doesn't give you a IDGAF card about her needs. You really don't seem to be trying to make things easier for her. There's nothing \"ridiculous\" about wanting you to play with the dog outside: when you're having migraines, any kind of noise can feel like a drill piercing your skull. Take her into account: you're exhausted, sure, but what about her ?", "YTA you sound insufferable I have ADHD and don\u2019t do that", "YTA.

I can't even begin to imagine that on top of the pregnancy sickness.\n\nBut yeah, not going to say you should get meds, bc that is a discussion in itself and totally up to you, but if you aren't able to manage it then you're wife is absolutely justified in this case. Find other ways to adapt, like bring the dog outside or to a park if you want to play with them", "YTA, you don't seems to realize when you are doing something wrong. Your wife being pregnant make things harder for her, even more as she have a rough pregnancy, and she doesn't have the patience to deal with you as she was may be doing in the past.", "Yta\n\nGet the medication. Whatever you are trying to do to tone it down is ***obviously not*** working. You aren't managing yourself properly.", "OP,  I'm really not sure why your wife continues to live with you. You are making her life absolutely miserable!  Apparently you really don't care, do you.", "YTA. You are showing a clear lack of respect for your wife who is going through a honestly painful and draining process of growing and supporting a baby. You think you\u2019re the one that\u2019s exhausted?! Have you ever had a migraine? They\u2019re the fucking worst. Now imagine you had one, and your partner showed little care and was banging around the house with the dog loudly even after being asked multiple times not to. It\u2019s the complete lack of understanding and total disrespect on your part.\nHonestly, give her the space she needs and try harder. She\u2019s being kind and taking care of herself as to not divorce you. ADHD is NOT an excuse.", "YTA - there's a very obvious solution there in black and white.  Get medicated.", "YTA. You\u2019re clearly not doing your best to deal with it. You make choices to play with the dog in the house a certain way, knowing it grates on your wife. You keep making excuses for your behavior but it\u2019s your wife who\u2019s suffering. Congratulations, she\u2019s gone, you can make all the noise you want now.", "YTA - you seem to think only your ADHD needs to be accommodated and not her migraines and pregnancy symptoms.", "YTA. I feel for you though.\n\nI have ADHD too, and also unmedicated by choice. What you\u2019re describing as \u2018trying\u2019 doesn\u2019t work for us. \n\nIf trying is \u201cI\u2019ll count on myself to remember and think of it and tone it down in the moment\u201d then you\u2019re doing it wrong. You\u2019re setting yourself up for failure there, because you know that remembering to tone it down when you\u2019re excited about something is nigh impossible. The bubblies start and you absolutely cannot be turned down lol. You might wish you could do it, but wishes clearly aren\u2019t working.\n\nI\u2019m also an acute migraine sufferer, and let me tell you - I think about cutting my own ears off. It hurts that bad, and is that inescapable, and random things can feel like someone\u2019s peeled all the skin off my body and stuck it back on inside out. If your singing is doing that to your wife, I\u2019m honestly impressed she hasn\u2019t come for you with sharp object yet. \n\nLet\u2019s go through what your wife asked:\n- don\u2019t play with the dog in the house\n- don\u2019t play with the dog loudly\n- don\u2019t sing or make loud noises\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d do to achieve these:\n- ask wife to immediately tell me I\u2019m singing, and immediately stop when asked\n- put all the dog toys next to the door, or better yet outside, so that when you want to play you remember to do so outside\n- set an alarm to take the dog on walks every day. I know this wasn\u2019t requested, but it\u2019ll get you out of the house where you can feel less trapped, and be as energetic as you like. Plus, doggo will probably love it.\n- if the lack of singing starts to get to you, set an alarm to go on drives. Car volume all the way up, you can belt it out as much as you like! \n\nThe biggest key though, is to make sure your wife sees you doing PREVENTATIVE measures to meet her requests, and that she sees you adapt new ones if the first set aren\u2019t working. My husband and I have had so many fights because I didn\u2019t do this. They just don\u2019t get how their solutions (just remember, put a sticky note on the door, etc) don\u2019t work. The only way it wouldn\u2019t work for them is if they weren\u2019t trying, so after a while, they start to doubt whether you\u2019re really trying. You can\u2019t blame them, it\u2019s effing weird! \n\nLook, she\u2019s carrying your baby, you want to reassure her that you love her and want her to feel well. You\u2019re frustrated because all this feels out of your control and she and others are reacting like you\u2019re doing it on purpose. You gotta let go of the defensive instinct - they\u2019re human too, they don\u2019t mean it, and you know it\u2019s harder for you. You can validate how difficult it is while still working to mitigate it. \n\nGood luck, and I hope you find a good balance!", "YTA, a pregnant woman needs to be taken care of. I know your trying but you should try to get on some medications to help with your ADHD. I understand why your pregnant wife is really annoyed. Constant migraines sounds horrible and you should try harder to take care of your wife. When she's no longer pregnant than it will be kinda ok but you should solve the issue together.", "YTA. You need to either go to therapy or use medication because self managing clearly isn't working. She's carrying yalls kid and you can't even stop playing with the dog inside?", "YTA. You say you're trying and/or don't realize you're doing it; on the other hand \"some of the requests are ridiculous at best\" refutes that. She's not ridiculous to ask not to get the dog all wound up in the house and to stop aggravating her migraines.", "YTA\n\nIf your buddy can back up what your wife is changing, and here you're still denying it, YTA. Show your wife some respect. Obviously not medicating yourself for ADHD and thinking you're \"handling\" it is not working. You should talk to a doctor.", "YTA and no mention of your wife having to be off meds that help with her mental health because of the pregnancy plus being nauseous and having migraines all the time. You are the one getting the dog hyper super early in the morning and singing at the top of your lungs after her sleepless nights and after repeated requests to stop.\n\nWhy are you choosing to not medicate when it may help centre you? You don\u2019t seem to be doing your best to deal with it if you\u2019re making home life a living hell for your wife to the point where she leaves you. You also seem to be using your ADHD as an excuse for your lack of awareness and considerations for others around you. Being asked multiple times to tone it down should be enough to make you aware.\n\nYou may want to find her post on this subreddit from a few days ago and see the comments on there to help you get a clue. Glad she left to get some peace and quiet.", "YTA\nMy girlfriend and I both have adhd (plus she's autistic) and neither of us would think of of pulling this. We can both get loud, super touchy, and extremely playful, but we tone it down when the other needs us to.\n\nBabies sleep a lot. Are you going to continue to play with the dog so loudly or be loud so often when the baby's asleep? What happens if the dog knocks into your wife and knocks her over(now or when shes holding the baby)? What about when the baby is on/low to the floor, like for tummy time or in a bouncer?\n\nI have a bit of advice. First, play with the dog outside, some. It's good for the dog, and less noisy for your wife. Second, start toning down how often you wind up the dog. Excitable dogs are fun, but they are dangerous for infants. It's a habit that needs to be stopped. Third, I wont be so quick to suggest medication as some here, but it's still on the table. Some say caffeine is pretty effective for ADHD symptoms, but idk. I do, however, strongly suggest therapy. Couples therapy or solo therapy, whichever, but something is definitely wrong.\n\nYou're not being considerate at all. You say you dont realize you're doing it, but you dont stop and think about it at all.

You have very clearly never had a migraine in your life. let me educate you one them since you dont seem to want to do it yourself. \n\n1. once you get a migraine there are many \"triggers\" that can make them worse. For some it is light, some sound and most people who suffer from them it is both. ( there are probably more but these are the most common) \n2. Migraines normally start with one of the worse headaches you will have in your life and when you are around triggers it feels like someone is trying to drive a dull railroad spike through your skull with a sledge hammer. (in your wifes case EVERYTIME YOU MAKING NOISE)\n3. What ever sense is causing the triggers become extra sensitive. So since your wife is more noise triggered  so her hearing becomes shaper. \n4. MIGRAINES CAN MAKE YOU PHYSICALLY SICK!!!!  ( once was sent home from work and almost taken to the hospital for one because people thought I was dying. I lost all color in my face and had to run to the bathroom to throw up several time.)\n\nThis means every time you are playing with your dog while your wife has a migraine you are putting her in pain. You are literally harming your wife and child and dont care what so ever.\n\nDo you even care about your wife or child? You are putting them both at risk because you cant remember not yell sing song or go outside to play with the dog. STOP MAKING EXCUSES AND DO BETTER!", "Every single man that submits on this sub uses ADHD as an excuse to be the most intolerable asshole imaginable.

I think it's safe to say this pregnancy has been particularly hard on her. She has damn near constant migraines and almost always feels nauseous and miserable. I was originally doing all I could to provide comfort but I'm admittedly growing exhausted because some of the requests are ridiculous at best. Like she doesn't want me playing with the dog indoors because the dog is very high energy and my wife is getting fed up with the dog plowing through the house to play with me. She said the sound of the dogs nails against hard wood, barking/whining and hearing me sing to the dog is nauseating (I make up songs that incorporate my dogs name and I have ADHD so admittedly it gets loud at times) and gives her a migraine. \n\nI also like.. \"stim\" a lot and don't even realize it half the time. Like I will repeatedly tell my wife I love her in singing form and again, it can get pretty loud and it's absolutely repetitive and I don't even realize I'm doing it until she just kind of stops what she's doing and stares at me with that look of annoyance on her face. I'm not medicated for my ADHD, per choice, but I do my best to deal with it.\n\nWell this morning I was playing with the dog and I thought I was being quiet but apparently not. I walk in to the bedroom and see my wife packing a suitcase. I asked her what was going on and she said \"I'm leaving for awhile. You purposely being loud and obnoxious with that dog and the constant scream singing isn't something I'm willing to tolerate right now, especially after I've asked you to tone it down and unless I go away for awhile I will end up divorcing you because I honestly don't like you right now.\" She didn't say anything else.

You admit the things you do with the dog, you loudly singing your \"I love yous\",  are you stimming.  Your reasons why you don't want medications are your own.  Nobody is going to tell you to do so.  But you don't get to blow off your wife's requests as ridiculous.   She's obviously going a difficult pregnancy and you admit she's exhausted.

If your wife has issues with anything she cannot take them because she is pregnant.  \n\nIf you took your medications, you would be able to pay attention to her and notice when she's in a good mood or when she's in a bad mood.

I'm glad you love the dog, but you gotta put the woman who is carrying your child first.", "YTA You are not \"dealing with\" your unmedicated disorder.

Your own breath sounds like a hurricane. Can you now understand how much pain your wife is in? Add in the pregnancy nausea and she must be in hell right now....and you cant even be considerate enough to take the dog outside to play. Plus you are not dealing with your ADHD at all.

Here's the reality of training though, from someone who grew up training and showing dogs in 4-H and in adulthood sent a dog to a trainer when I didn't have time.  Training takes hours, days, weeks, but the most important factor is that when a dog has behavior issues it's usually the human that is at fault and needs the most correction(s).  This dude can't even moderate and/or correct *himself*.  He is incapable of giving a dog the reinforcement it needs at home to keep it well behaved.

Yeah, but if she just got rid of it she\u2019d suck a lot more than him right now.", "Which is a FIXABLE behavior. But casting aside an animal due to the owners fault- is wrong.
