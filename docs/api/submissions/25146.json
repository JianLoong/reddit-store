So when I was 21 she asked me if I wanted to be the father of her child. I knew how strong was her desire to have a child and I thought she would've been an amazing mother (even single) so I agreed.\n\nHowever since the beggining I made clear that I didn't want to be a father and I'd have nothing to do with supporting her child, she had to figure it all out herself. She said she was fine with that and, even though I trusted her, I wrote all of that down and made her sign it because my desire to be child free was one of my priorities in life (and still is).\n\nWe startes trying and she became pregnant pretty quick and she was very excited. We were still friends and when she was about half way the pregnancy she started dating Alex (26M) and near the end of the pregnancy she started to ignore my attempts to talk to her.\n\nI didn't hear from her for some months when suddently she called me and asked to meet. I agreed and when we met was me, her and her boyfriend. He said that he wanted to adopt the child and I agreed. The adoption went great and they didn't contact me again.\n\nA month ago I received a call from Mia saying she wanted to meet. This time I was a bit reclutant since I didn't see a reason but after some pressuring I agreed. We sat and she asked how I was doing. After some informations about my life her boyfriend explained the reason of the meeting, he me to replace him as the father of the child since he didn't want to do it anymore.\n\nI was shocked. Then she said she wanted me to start to spend time with the boy and pay child support (also the 3 years I obviously did not pay). I just stood up and as I was walking away he screamed that it was my responsability to provide for him. Since then they stared to harrasing me.\n\nA couple days ago Mia came to my house and said she gave me enough time to adjust and if I didn't do it she would keep me to court. I said I was not changing my mind and she screamed that after abandoning him I had to do it and that was the least I could do. I responded I didn't abandon him since I didn't even met him until a month ago and I was not going to pay for someone that to me is a random child I have no relationship with and I didn't want to start one. She left screaming I was an asshole and she'd see me in court.\n\nNow I don't think I'm in the wrong at all, but she has always been a calm and rational person, so her behaviours made me question myself. I don't know if the paper I made her sign is worth something. To be fair, I could totally pay for it if I wanted to, but I made clear since the beginning I was not going to and it's just not fair.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n(Throw away account)\n\n\nEDIT: We did not have sex to get her pregnant. It was me that suggested it and she immediately agreed.\nThere are details I intially included and then cut off for the limit. One I think it's important to understand Mia choice at that age is that she always wanted to be a mother and that feeling increased when she had 2 abortions at 16 and 17 because of her family. It was probably the right thing to do, but she wanted to keep it both of the times. I think that is why at just 21 she decided to do that, but even at that age she seemed more than mature to make that decision and keep that responsibility (even her parents that time were completely supportive).", "created_utc": 1692564358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wmfzc/aita_for_not_wanting_anything_to_do_with_my/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
