I understood I was not invited. This was confirmed as he forwarded me the invitation that he had received from our neighbour. I don\u2019t know why he sent me this.\n\nI thought it was weird but I didn\u2019t express it. Then my boyfriend asked me to think about what he should gift him. This question annoyed me. Since I am not invited to the reception, I don\u2019t want the mental duty of thinking of a proper gift. I ignored the question.\n\nMy boyfriend has lived in the apartment for 2 years and I moved in this february. He is way more extroverted than I am and chats with the neighbours a few times a week. I speak to them sometimes, but not a lot. \n\nLast night he asked me again to think about what he should gift them. I told him I didn\u2019t want to help him with a gift for a reception that he, our neighbours and several other people in the building will be attending, while I am left alone at home. I was annoyed and upset.\n\nMy boyfriend argued that it makes sense since I don\u2019t seek a relation with them. He pointed out that the neighbours have invited us over for a glass of  wine several times (by mail to my bf), which I have never attended. Although I admit I have never been eager to join them, I have never delined these invitations. My boyfriend has declined on my behalf, without asking me if I\u2019d like to come first. He has gone without me a few times before I moved in and one time while I have been living here, while I was out with friends.\n\nMy boyfriend does not understand where I am coming from. He does not understand that I think it\u2019s weird that our neighbours only invited him, since I don\u2019t talk much to them and his request with the gift was just if I had something at the top of mind, which makes it a fair request, according to him. He thinks I am being overly sensitive.\n\nSo, AITA for being upset about not being invited to the reception and my boyfriends request for help with the gift? \n\nI am genuinely curious to know if it is just me who find this situation odd", "created_utc": 1695302453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ofse1/aita_for_being_upset_about_my_bf_asking_me_to/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like your BF is the problem. He has actively prevented you from being included in prior social interactions, which effectively set a precedent that your neighbors probably could not decode, so their recent invite to only him is fairly reasonable in my eyes. WHY is your BF declining invitations on your behalf without asking you? And why would he later use that as reasoning against you? Does he want to somehow keep these neighborhood friendships as his alone? Or do you think this is well-intended on his behalf, where he is making an assumption you don't have interest in participating? If the latter, that still is pretty presumptuous and controlling on his part.", "> I have never delined these invitations. My boyfriend has declined on my behalf, without asking me if I\u2019d like to come first\n\nWhat do you mean? Why has he been declining on your behalf?", "NTA. Your boyfriend says it makes sense that you don't have a relation because you have not attended the invitations for wine, but these invitations he declined on your behalf without asking you? So if you don't have an opening to actually build a relation with the neighbours it is actually his fault for the actions he is taking to shut those down?", "NTA. He was wrong for declining on your behalf without consulting you. When he decided for you, he also willingly accepted the responsibility of deciding and choosing a gift. Since he is clearly a mind reader - as demonstrated by his decision on your behalf - he should just read his neighbour's mind and pick the perfect gift", "NTA. But your BF sure is. He declines on your behalf without asking you. Since you rarely go out and chat with the neighbors, they might not even know you actually live with him. \n\nYou are not being overly sensitive for being upset about being asked to pick a gift for someone you have never met, your boyfriend actively prevents you from having any sort of relationship with, and know next to nothing about them. \n\nI find it really odd he keeps declining on your behalf without talking to you first. I would say since they invite you over a lot, and they invited your BF, he can bring a +1. I would go and say happy birthday at least and give a nice card. BUT make it very clear your BF, since he knows the birthday person better, picked out the present all on his own.", "NTA\n\nI am really sick of some men pretending they aren't good at getting gifts. It's not rocket science. Hot take: it was rude as hell not to extend the invitation to you'd.", "NTA\u2026 your boyfriend is an idiot", "NTA. Your boyfriend is not entitled to your mental labor.", "Everybody is focused on why you  don't want go to these get togethers. It does not have anything to do with whether you should help him figure out a gift. You are not obligated to do that. Bf is an adult. He should be able to figure it out.", "More info is needed. Have you spoken to your bf about why he declines on your behalf? Is it because you\u2019ve been out with friends so he, logically, says you cannot attend? Is it because you\u2019ve expressed that you do not wish to have a friendship with the neighbors? I think this could all be solved if you and your bf have a conversation about it, and perhaps he could inquire with the host if the invite includes significant others as well?", "NTA\n\nAnd here\u2019s why. According to OP\u2019s comments, the boyfriend keeps declining invites on her behalf, usually before she even knows about it so she\u2019s already made plans AND in some cases she didn\u2019t know she was invited as well.\n\nThe neighbours now think she\u2019s a stuck up, anti-social biotch who doesn\u2019t want to get to know them.\n\nThanks bf.", "NTA. It's understandable you are upset of not being invited. I might have misunderstood but it sounds like low-key your bf is trying to not involve you by declining the invitation on your behalf. Maybe the neighbors now didn't invite you because they came to understand (mistakenly) you don't want to attend these events. I agree with you that it's a mental burden/task to think about a gift. Asking once is okay.but he asked twice. Sounds low-key like he is outsourcing emotional labor.", "NTA. Maybe have a chat with the neighbours expressing that you are shy but would love to come to their event.", "There\u2019s something weird about this\u2026 why would he decline on your behalf and keep you at a distance from them\u2026 they\u2019re 80\u2026Is there other neighbours invited to these wine nights he goes to? Something seems off with this whole situation. Seems weird that they would invite just him to an event where the amount of guests doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 unless he\u2019s telling them that maybe you two aren\u2019t together? Or are more fwb. I don\u2019t know\u2026 but I would definitely go over one evening before even if it\u2019s just wish him a happy birthday maybe hand him a bottle of wine, and apologise for being so busy but let them know going forward you\u2019ll be there. I can\u2019t speak on your bfs actions because to me they make no sense without further context.", "YTA. Just give him a suggestion for a gift for an 80yr old man. He\u2019s excited. Don\u2019t rain on his parade. \n\nSounds like you want the invitation without wanting to go.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't invited and shouldn't be put on the spot of figuring out a gift.\n\nThe BIGGER issue is that he clearly used you as an excuse to ditch a  few invitation  for wine and conversation to go hang with the boys.  No wonder the neighbors didn't invite you.  This is his  doing.", "NTA.  Not your friends, you weren\u2019t  invited, not your problem to find or help pay for a gift.", "NTA.", "This happened to me (not the present part but the friends/neighbors invitations and boyfriend not telling me or declining for me thing). I ended up feeling like none of our friends or neighbors liked me. It was a big misunderstanding and miscommunication. I explained it to my boyfriend with our neighbors and friends present. He didn\u2019t want to invite me without their consent (not his party to invite people to) and they assumed that when they invited him (\u201chey we are all going tubing on Friday! You\u2019re coming right?\u201d Or similar) that I was just included as a package deal. So they thought they were inviting me by inviting him, and he thought they were just inviting him since they didn\u2019t explicitly say \u201care you and clever coming?\u201d So he didn\u2019t want to just bring me without me being invited. Ever since that talk, he tells me about events beforehand, asks if I want to (or can due to work etc) come, and then either we go, or just he goes.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, your boyfriend may not be either. Or he might be and my situation isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening lol.", "First off, you are NTA, your boyfriend definitely is. It seems, from what has been started here, that he enjoys having these events to himself, and doesn't have the guts to say that to you.  Even before you moved in together, I would have expected him to bring you to events like the wine thing as his partner and other-half (yes it's a shitty saying  ;)). My guess, he is the one keeping you out, not the neighbors...\n\nI would plan an open house for the neighbors (if you want to get to know them) - like a bring a bottle to share type thing.", "I gotta say ESH, possibly him more than you. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you were NOT invited to the party, just that he's the person they talk to so obviously he gets the invite. Or, they just assume you won't come anyway since you don't go to other gatherings. \n\nBut if he's declining invites without you telling him to, then he's sort of blocking you from establishing any relationship with them at all. You say you aren't eager to go but does that mean you would still go anyway or do you not have any interest and he knows that? \n\nLastly though, bf didn't ask you to buy a gift, nor contribute, he just asked for an idea. People do this frequently for things they aren't part of. Hell, I have a group text right now where a friend is trying to figure out what to get her husband.\n\nSo basically yes, I personally think you're being over sensitive, and if you don't want to go to these gatherings I don't understand what the issue is. But on the other hand, if you DO want to be involved and he's created an image of you that isn't interested, then he sucks.", ">I don\u2019t want the mental duty of thinking of a proper gift\n\nIt's hardly asking your help on writing a paper on nuclear physics, he's asking for help in living a gift. Takes but a few minutes, phrasing it a \"mental duty\" is being dramatic.\n\nThat said, why is he declining on your behalf? That sounds bizarre. \n\n>Although I admit I have never been eager to join them, I have never delined these invitations\n\nAre you more pissed at not being asked and being given the chance to say no?", "Nah", "NTA. You are not required to do so for a party you are not invited to. But the real question is, why is your boyfriend sabotaging your relationship with neighbors?", "Nta", "Nta but they don\u2019t have to invite you either. Your bf sounds kind of like the problem if he blocked you from hanging with them", "Show you bf this thread.  If he doesn't understand after that, trust me he understands he just doesn't care.  I bet it's the latter.", "NTA- The way your boyfriend is acting is like he doesn't want you to be friends with them.\n\nI am getting that from \"My boyfriend has declined on my behalf, without asking me if I\u2019d like to come first. He has gone without me a few times before I moved in and one time while I have been living here\"\n\nSo yeah I would definitely be able to salty about not being invited to something even if you don't know them very well.  How often are partners included.  \n\nIf he can't be bothered to extend an invitation they do send you then. I don't see why you should owe him any mental bandwidth to think about what these people want for a gift.", "NTA, it's really weird that you weren't invited as part of a couple, and it's ESPECIALLY weird that your boyfriend keeps turning down invites FOR you without your knowledge. I'd just go anyway tbqh they're neighbors, get a little face time and then bounce. What's your boyfriend's deal?", "INFO is bf asking you to help pay for a gift or just brainstorm ideas?", "NTA he could certainly ask the neighbors if he can bring you, chances are they may not realize you actually moved in full time.  But if he won't even do that, figuring out the gift is on him.", "Is your boyfriend concerned that these neighbors will share stories of his escapades during the two years before you moved in and that these stories might be counter to your impression of him?  \nRegardless of why he is deliberately keeping you apart from these neighbors, it does make it silly for him to then ask you for your input re: a gift for that same neighbor.\n\nThe thing to be upset about is your boyfriend's concerning attitude and behavior about you and the neighbors in general.  If you've deliberately chosen not to address that than, honestly, you are kind of the AH to get upset about him asking for advice re: a gift.  \nThe response to that is simply a casual \"No clue what to get him; I don't know him at all.\"", "YTA. Eventually after turning down so many invitations and never talking to people, they stop bothering with invites for you, that's just how it works. Then you're upset that you weren't invited and take it out on your BF by being snarky about the gift. I'm sure you ask him to do things or give input on things that have nothing to do with him and he helps you, so don't pout and just throw out a suggestion or two and move on. Would you even have any interest in going to the birthday anyway?? Or are you just mad that you didn't get invited so you could say no again?", "ESH. \n\n\"while I am left alone at home\" - that's your choice, you can easily make other plans. \n\n\"My boyfriend argued that it makes sense since I don\u2019t seek a relation with them.\" - well, there you go. You do have some accountability here. \n\n\"My boyfriend has declined on my behalf, without asking me if I\u2019d like to come first.\" - then you need to have a talk with him.", "Girl...\n\nYour boyfriend is keeping you at home away from fun and friends (or even potential friends).

Not a good look.\n\nYou were very rude to your BF for ignoring his question on gift ideas - please note that you are not responsible for coming up with ideas, he's a bit of an AH for pressing you on this as if it's your responsibility - but you ignoring him is way worse.\n\nYTA.

Grow up, this is incredibly petty.", "YTA.\n\nYou're a child.", "ESH. You both seem immature.", "NTA, and the people saying you are on here obviously did not read your post.

It is not something to even give a second thought about.", "Kind of YTA, not for the gift but for everything else. \n\nJust say you don't know him so well and there is nothing in your mind. Problem solved. \n\nWhat makes you an AH is that you have resentements towards your bf for being more extroverted and having more friends in the building than you and the same time you resent the neighbour for not trying harder to gain your friendship. Bc i really don't have another explanation why you would react so upset and have the need to say stuff like \n\n>our neighbours and several other people in the building will be attending, while I am left alone at home.\n\nObviously thats not ok for you but you seem to think its everybody else job to solve this for you. If you want to get invited to events, you will have to make the effort to get to know the people, even if you don't like smalltalk. Why is your neighbour only mailing your bf and not you too if you are invited for the winedringink? Exactly, he established a relationship with said neighbour, took the time and made the effort for it. You didn't. \n\nYou just want to eat your cake and have it. Not making the effort to have a friendship but still expect to be invited to their events. Thats not how it works. Thats not school anymore where the teacher can force the neighbour to invite the whole class. You just get the effort back you have put in - and thats not very much according to your post.

(How are you supposed to know their likes and dislikes when you don't know them?)\n\n2- You don't know these people because he has declined invites from them for you WITHOUT your knowledge. (So he KNOWS that you don't know then, and wants your input anyway) \n\n3- He is going to this party ALONE, but wants you to give input on a gift.

Sorry.\")\n\n4- He talks to them regularly and goes to these wine events alone etc (Why does HE not know what they would like or not?)\n\n\nIdk. I'm what I call an introverted extrovert. I want to talk to and socialize with people, but I'm really bad at it and it leaves me exhausted later. My husband is the opposite, he doesn't like to socialize nor talk to people, but he is really good at it. He always manages to find someone wherever we are to talk to about something. Neither of us would EVER do that to the other (declining invites for the other person). Like even when we were dating if he was invited and I wasn't, I had to convince him to go. But not only that, again if he knows them and you don't, how are you supposed to pick something they like?! Thats the part that makes me the most confused. From an I don't know them either stand point, I know they like wine. But what kind? Do they have a favorite brand or flavor. A favorite year? No clue. You shouldn't be trying to figure out a present for them because you don't know them, but I'd make an effort to get to know them at this point. And honestly if they were to being up the wine invites, I'd have been honest and apologized because \"I had no idea that I was invited to those. I was always told he was just going to them. I didn't want to intrude.\"", "NTA. He's the guest, not you, so it's his responsibility to figure out a gift.

This is standard gender shit where men don't think they're capable of thinking about another person and coming up with suitable gift ideas so they get the woman to do it.", "Info: Why is he gatekeeping these elderly neighbours? Do they perhaps have an attractive granddaughter?", "NTA boyfriend is though.    The fact he didn't try to include her even to the party is a massive red flag too.", "I would contact the neighbor in question and ask if it\u2019s ok to come along .
