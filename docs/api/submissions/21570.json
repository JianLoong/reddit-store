This all hinged on sisters fianc\u00e9 agreeing to take care of the boys while we are away. The last time we got to see my sister btw was 3 years ago at Christmas.\r  \n\r  \nFew days go by we get a text that he couldn't book the days off work to take care of the boys. Disappointed but ok it's one of those things, we will just go another time.\r  \n\r  \nFew days later we see on fb him out with the boys in Amsterdam for a week. He can take a week off for himself but cannot take 2 days off work (he doesn't work weekends so it would just be the Mon & Fri) to take care of the boys so his fianc\u00e9 could spend a weekend with her family and celebrate her mums birthday. We were pissed. Btw this is all for a trip in September, not a last minute thing..\r  \n\r  \nThis is not the first time he's done something like this, he has always been selfish and entitled. Last time they came to visit they stayed with my parents so they didn't pay for hotel. He didn't offer to pay for drinks/food when we went out, offer to chip in for food for the house or even offer petrol money when we picked them up/dropped them off at the airport. We aren't the biggest fans of him to say the least but we never mentioned any of this to sister.\r  \n\r  \nWe asked my sister again if he's sure he cant get the days off work and it all escalated from there. It came up that he's hurt he wasn't invited on the trip. This was always a girls trip, my Dad is not invited neither my boyfriend, they are fine with it.\r  \n\r  \nMy mum and I were pissed that he was the reason we would not be able to go, so we booked tickets and decided to go just us two. My sister found out and is now super angry because \"you can't just decide to go anyway just because 1 person can't go anymore\". I understand this.\r  \n\r  \nAs an effort to keep the peace my parents booked another trip in December, this time fianc\u00e9 was got the days off work (suddenly now he can after we called him out) so my sister can come with her oldest son, but is still sulking he's not invited. This trip will include my Dad. The reason we couldn't invite the fianc\u00e9 and youngest is because he's too young for the plans we have and fianc\u00e9 expects my parents to pay for them both because they are paying for my sister and nephew. They cannot afford this.\r  \n\r  \nWe still get our girls trip, my dad will take my nephew one day we will do our own thing.

That is your sis\u2019s business to deal with. Yeah it sucks, but it is what it is. You\u2019re unrelated to the situation in my eyes and shouldn\u2019t have to cancel the trip for others.", "NTA. This is a relationship issue between your sister and her partner. It\u2019s unfair you and your mum can\u2019t go on holiday because he won\u2019t look after his own kids. Your sister needs to work with him on this for any future trips", "Nta.  My mother passed 10 years.  My two sisters and I have travelled with our father every year  since so he has someone to take a vacation with.  In the years since my mom passed we have only been able to all go twice.  We have families and jobs and can\u2019t always get the time off at the same time.  It is what it is.  No one gets pissed, although we might be disappointed.  The most important thing is that our father gets a trip every year", "Completely NTA. The difficulties your sister has stem from her non helpful bf. If you wait until she can definitely make a trip, it could easily be in 5-7 years time. Neither you nor your mum have to wait/put your lives on hold until she is in a better place.\n\nShe has chosen her life, even if it hasn't turned out how she expected it to. She has to accept that other people also have their lives and you have to grab opportunities as they come up.\n\nSorry to be morbid, but especially your mum. Hopefully she has 20-30 years of good life ahead of her but as you get older you really don't know how your health will also go. I put off a trip with a friend as she couldn't make it in 2019. Then the pandemic happened. I waited last year to hear and now, whilst I could technically go on my own, my own health has deteriorated and I simply can't do the walking it would involve now. Grab it while you can.", "NTA, her beef is with her baby daddy. I am surprised she is audacious enough to come swinging at you. Girl should put some of that energy where it matters.", "NTA\n\nYour sister's problem is not your problem.  It is unfortunate but life is full of unfortunates.  Also, her fianc\u00e9 strike me as not so mature if he is sulking and act \"hurt\" because he was not invited.", "NTA.  Just because your sister cannot arrange child care doesn't mean you and your mom should have to lose out on a trip.", "NTA...if your sister really wanted to come so badly, she needed to better handle her situation. Her relationship issues are hers to deal with. You're making this entirely about him, when it's not.", "NTA\n\nWhen person has a child they must be prepared to left out of things from time to time , chilcare can' t always be fixed , childern get sick last minute etc... if person had kids with an AH  then the above counts twice as much.\n\nBoth were her decisions, the kids and the prat she calls fiance. She cannot be angry at you not revolving around her decisions .\n\n\\-also  Iassume her living abroad was her responsibility as well", "NTA.  So you can never go on holiday with your mum, when she is not available?\n\nShe could not make it that's unfortunate, but doesn't mean everyone else has to miss out.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault your sister cannot go with you.\n\nI'm not even sure why she's angry to be honest. If my siblings and I had arranged a trip away with my mum and then for some reason I couldn't go, I think it would be extremely selfish of me to expect them to cancel their plans. The same applies to your sister.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue where the BF *couldn\u2019t* get time off, and changing the trip to a different date would have allowed everyone to go. It\u2019s an issue where the BF can\u2019t grasp that partners aren\u2019t welcome on a trip set up for a mother and her daughters to spend time together. Ultimately, while I feel sorry for your sister, it\u2019s not your fault or your mum\u2019s fault that sister\u2019s BF is a crappy partner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her partner seems abusive and from your post it sounds like he uses the children to trap your sister at their home. \n\nCould you support your sister and thwart her partners controlling behaviour by providing alternative childcare such as your dad, so your sister can escape her partners toxic attitude? \n\nPlease use this next holiday to talk to your sister and find out if she\u2019s really happy and maybe help her gain her independence?\n\nPlease make sure that your sister\u2019s partner isn\u2019t purposely (slowly) alienating your sister from your mum and yourself. From your post, it sounds like your sisters partner resents your sister being afforded opportunities to enjoy her life.

We thought to fly the entire family out to my parents place and then catch the flight just us three for the weekend but that was too expensive since its then 4 flights (coming to our country, going to holiday, coming back from holiday and then flights for them back home). This is what fianc\u00e9 wanted to begin with since then he also gets a paid holiday -\\_-\n\nWe will talk to her for sure, she's always been such a strong character but since she moved out it's just been bad relationship after bad relationship.\n\nI will make sure she is okay."]}
