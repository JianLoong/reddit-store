Both work & are equal income earners.\n\nMy in laws, who I only met a few times before our son was born, live in Israel and had been very nice- although there is a language barrier. After our son was born, my MIL came to stay with us for 6 wks, which we were grateful for, but due to the language barrier, her presence was awkward and difficult at times. MIL started becoming overbearing, commenting on how our son was dressed, hovering while we changed the diaper, etc. MIL wanted the baby to call her Maw Maw (which means grandma in Hebrew)-  I politely said no to this bc it can be confusing in English being too similar to Mama. After her visit I felt a bit traumatized, but was still thankful for the help. \n\nWhen the events in Israel started this year, my MIL & FIL came to the US to stay with us for safety. This is when things start unraveling. So far here is what I\u2019ve experienced during my in-law\u2019s 2.5 month visit:\n- FIL constantly comments about how I should cook & clean more, perform more \u201cwifely duties\u201d (even though I work and earn the same as my SO)\n- MIL enters mine and my SO\u2019s room without knocking MULTIPLE times\n- MIL cannot watch the baby for more than a couple hours bc she is too tired, so we still take him to daycare. Side note my FIL won\u2019t help since \u201cit\u2019s a woman\u2019s duty\u201d\n- The in laws and SO don\u2019t speak English in front of me, so I feel very left out in most conversations\n- The in laws do not have a car so they never leave the house and when they do, they need to be driven \n- MIL has reorganized the whole house including where we keep our private intimate items\n- MIL didn\u2019t take either mine or my son\u2019s food allergy seriously and 2 separate times added ingredients to our food that caused reactions (luckily these  events didn\u2019t lead to hospital visits)\n- MIL taken over the kitchen, critiques me all the time, etc.  \n\nTo make matters worse, MIL dotes on SO so he has regressed a child state, where he lets her do everything for him & he hasn\u2019t helped with our son or household chores. He owns a growing business, so he has been working late on weeknights and weekends; which leaves me home with FIL/MIL the majority of the time. My SO also sees nothing wrong with the situation, and in his eyes his mother can do no wrong.\n\nMy in laws have other family in the US: another son with 3 kids, & MIL has 2 sisters. They have plenty of money and resources, so they are not staying with us for any money related issues. They have visited their other son for 4 days during their 2.5 month stay with us, and I\u2019m told my MIL\u2019s sisters will not allow them to visit due to a separate situation where they overstayed their welcome. \n\nAt this point I want our guests gone and want to feel comfortable in my home again. I\u2019m am very sure that my SO would love for his parents to move in with us permanently. \n\nAITA for asking them to stay somewhere else?", "created_utc": 1704558695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1903qxq/aita_squatter_in_laws/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have an in-law problem. You have a spouse problem. It's his responsibility to deal with his family and to prioritize his immediate family - which is you and your child. You need to lay it all on the line with him and probably seek some marriage counseling (not from a religious source). Good luck!", "NTA.Be firm .Ask Hubby if he wants to pay for a sep.apt for you ( or him and his parents ).", "NTA, they overstepped so many boundaries you ate in your right to kick them out, and if your husband does not agree with that, he can go with them. Because this is no way of living. It's your home, your sanctuary, and a place to relax and feel comfortable. They make that impossible for you.", "NTA\n\nThis is your house not theirs.  They are guests staying out of your kindness of your heart and they are abusing that kindness.  \n\nKick them out.  \n\nTell your husband they have to leave and can go and stay in a hotel until they find somewhere more permanent.  Don't ask him if its ok but tell him that's the way its going to be.  Don't let them dither but put a very short time limit on it because there are plenty of hotels and they seem to have plenty of money to pay for it.  \n\nThey sound absolutely horrible and I would have booted them out long ago.", "Mawmaw is NOT grandmother in Hebrew, sabta is.

Others are intrusive, talking down to you, reorganising the house, and some that are unacceptable, entering your room and feeding your child allergies. Oh, no - wait, that one is dangerous.

SO is regressing, when he's behaving like a child he does not deserve to be a husband and should not be a father. He has to choose. Make it very clear OP, this is serious.", "NTA. They're disrespecting you and your way of living in your own home. Your home is where you should feel the most comfortable, and not have to be judged by in-laws who are overstepping and critical.

You said they are from Israel.  Are they observant Jews?  Are you?
