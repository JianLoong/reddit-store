I was shocked, but before i got to react, her sister yelled, \"She just got you to lick her piss,\" and I thought the pregnancy test was a prank to get me to lick it. I dropped it and the ice cream tub, and apparently, I looked disgusted. They explained right away that it was washed, so we celebrated, and I totally forgot about it.\n\nLater, when most people left, her friend confronted me saying I shouldn't have reacted that way and how it wasn't even something to be disgusted of.

WTF is wrong with her?", "NTA. Saw video about such announcement in Instagram just few days ago. Had pretty much the same reaction. Even if you wash it, it is not a sealed thing and it is still piss. It is stupid and humiliating.\n\nIf I did that to my husband, he would probably consider leaving me.  And he did really well during my labour and was a huge support.", "NTA absolutely disgusting. Such a weird idea", "That is absolutely revolting. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. That is super gross.", "her sister yelled, \"She just got you to lick her piss,\".\n\nNTA. If your wife wanted a normal reaction, she shouldnt have announced the pregnancy in such a bizarre way. It does sound like a prank tbh\n\n\"tiktok told me how to handle this major life event\" doesnt sound very dignified.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that being available during labour and your ability to lap up someone elses piss with a smile on your face are not in any way connected.\n\nTbh everyone in this story apart from the OP sounds like an idiot.", "You\u2019re def NTA", "NTA\n\nDrawing correlation between you being disgusted when you found out you were licking something that had been pissed on and not being able to fulfill your role as the husband when your wife is delivering your child is a bit of a stretch.", "NTA washed or not it was peed on, do they have any idea how unsanitary that is????? That\u2019s absolutely disgusting and I would question if she has the maturity level to raise a kid if she thinks something that disgusting is funny. Her friend needs to mind her business or go lick a pee stick and see how she likes it because if they just washed it with water it\u2019s not clean!!! I highly doubt they used soap because you would be able to smell it.", "NTA- I mean, could they have just put it in a ziplock first?!? Would it have been that hard?", "NTA. She took an important moment and tried to turn it into a stupid social media stunt. Honestly that\u2019s pretty upsetting. Who would react well when thinking they might be consuming someone else\u2019s pee?? This is real life, she should be enjoying these moments instead of trying to film everything and make it \u201cseem\u201d funny or nice for internet reactions.", "NTA That\u2019s disgusting.", "NTA.\n\nWho sticks something they\u2019ve pissed on in someone\u2019s food? I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s been washed. It was stilled pissed on.\n\nIt sounds like your wife and her friends are real immature. Hopefully, she will grow up a bit before the child is born.", "NTA \ud83e\udd22", "Nta hope she grows up in time for kid", "NTA. That\u2019s a genuinely different scenario. \n\nBeing surprised by a pregnancy test in food and urine. \n\nVs\n\nShowing up to support your loved one for a natural event you spend months preparing for.", "NTA. That is such a bizarre thing to do.", "What does this have to do with being available to her while she is in labour? You're not going to be delivering the baby with your mouth. NTA", "Gross!!\nNTA\n\nI wish people would give their partner a chance to react privately and not in a group setting. That's for the couple to do together to their family and friends.", "NTA,  your wife and her friends are very immature and I question her ability to take care of a child.  I\u2019m sure she will get all her parenting ideas from TikTok.", "Nope nope nope you have every right to be disgusted NTA", "NTA. Ewwwww.", "NTA, that's disgusting, I would have puked. Your wife should spend less time in tik tok because that was a terrible way to announce a pregnancy.", "NTA.  Who wants to lick a used pregnancy test?  Yuck.", "NTA what THEY did is way more gross than they\u2019re making it seem. Sorry you\u2019re having a baby with someone who emulates tiktok videos in what should have been a very special moment.", "NTA that\u2019s gross, if you\u2019re going to do that use a fresh one for the ice cream and have the used one separately", "NTA. I would 100% drop anything that looked like a pregnancy test (including COVID tests and other similarly shaped items) hidden in my food because another human's bodily fluids are involved -- and if someone wants me to consume their bodily fluids in any form, **they get my effing consent beforehand**. They don't sneak it into something I'm eating/drinking. That's effed up.\n\nYou had every right to be disgusted by the ***idea*** that your friends/family violated your concent in this manner. That's not funny, it's horrifying.\n\nHow can they trust you'll be able to support your partner during labor? *Because you have fully consented to do so and will be prepared to do so*. That \"friend\" tried to reframe this as you \"having issues\" with bodily fluids. Again, that's effed up. The issue here was always about consent - (and it was super messed up that the sister laughed about you eating urine like that).\n\nI feel like there are hundred of objects your significant other could've hidden in your ice cream to say \"I'm pregnant!\" that are much better than the actual, physical pregnancy test. I'm not gonna say she's TA here (she did say she washed it offer), but *anyone* who sees a USED pregnancy test is gonna assume there's pee on it. It's not something you should use as a prop that you hide in food.", "NTA \n\nSounds like the friend is into not \u201cshaming\u201d anything. \n\nThere\u2019s a line..( pardon the pun) and it was definitely crossed and very very cringe. They need to get off the stick and grow up.. (oops) another pun not intended \n\nCongratulations to you both though! \n\nThat friend or friends are reaching from hell and sound nasty!  Such pissy behavior \n\nEdited", "NTA.\n\nand her friend obviously knows it was gross because of the joke she made about you licking the pee. sticking a pregnancy test in a type of food is gross.\ncongrats on the pregnancy though!", "NTA!!! Holy crapola!", "NTA...if anything you should be pissed at her and her friends. Also when she told you, it should have been private and not a bunch of people focusing on your reaction to eating her piss. She's your wife. Why couldn't she announce it to you (prank or not) privately.", "NTA! This was a ridiculous way to make a private announcement! And her friend had no business \u201cconfronting\u201d you. Major overstep! \n\nShe\u2019s her friend. You are her husband and father of the child she\u2019s carrying. Your wife needs to tell her friend to back off and apologize to you! Everyone involved owes you an apology. \n\nAnyone with common sense would know that Putting a used pregnancy test in your ice cream could result in a grossed out response. It\u2019s natural to be disgusted when you\u2019re told you licked urine. WTH? They acted like 12 year olds then scolded you. \n\nYou\u2019ve got problems.", "I mean, I\u2019d be more concerned about her maturity and ability to parent if she\u2019s doing this and then not having the ability to realize she\u2019s nasty\u2026I mean wrong. Just remember, just because you have kids, doesn\u2019t mean you need to stay together. NTA", "That's disgusting and her friend is a jerk but I'd let it go and focus on the baby. NTA", "Nta. Pee is disgusting unless you have a piss kink. Besides seeing blood and licking piss are two very different things that cannot be compared. You wont be eating out your wife when she will be giving birth, so their comments make no sense.", "I just can't believe people are stupid enough to have to be told not to stick their piss sticks into other people's food.", "NTA. They all sound immature. I hope your wife wasn\u2019t entertaining their discussion about you because that would make me question being happy about bringing a child into this world with her if she doesn\u2019t even trust you over something stupid SHE did.", "NTA, that's weird as hell.", "You're (hopefully) prepared for the delivery however one is never prepared to lick piss.\n\nUnless this is your kink, in that case no judgement here. NTA", "NTA. \n\nWhat a gross way to announce a pregnancy.", "NTA. She nasty.", "NTA this is weird and gross and your reaction is not indicative of how you'll deal with all the gross shit (pun intended) that's heading your way. On that note, since we are talking about someone else's pee in your mouth, make sure to keep in closed while you're changing diapers if you have a boy.", "NTA. That is weird and disgusting. I'm surprised so many people were okay with it. So weird.", "Oh wow that\u2019s my fault for knowing how to read.", "NTA.\n\nAnybody would react to potentially licking piss like that.", "As soon as I read TikTok, I was like, you're getting pranked dude. NTA", "NTA, that's gross.", "NTA. She \"cleaned it?\" It's a foam pad impregnated (no pun) with urine and she made you lick it.", "NTA\n\nso, congratulations. \n\nto begin with, this was a VERY childish thing to do. and our SIL's reaction proved it perfectly. \n\nher friend, though, should STFU and mind her business. starting drama and bullshit because you, at first, thought it wasn't clean is just that...drama and bullshit. and then questioning whether you'd be able to handle it during labour? it does make me wonder if she thinks SHE'S going to be there as well during delivery. might want to have a chat with your wife about this.", "This reminds me of a meme I once saw that said \"how can you say you love her when you won't even eat her poop?\"\n\nNTA, so much. That's disgusting.", "Nobody wants to eat piss cream. NTA", "I don't think this happened at all. However on the off chance it did you would certainly be in the clear. No wrongs done.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you're gonna be expected to lick the afterbirth.", "NTA. What a tasteless prank.", "NTA, that is a form of abuse.", "NTA\n\nEwww!!  Who would think that putting a used pregnancy test in icecream and then telling you to lick it was a good idea - your partner - and her friends are disgusting", "NTA.  Every single person involved should be told what they can do with their opinion of your reaction\u2026 right up their bum to join their heads.", "A pee stick in your ice cream? Really? uh un. I don't care if she sanitized it. Its a pee stick used for the purpose of peeing on. And pee and food are not what I think of together in my mind for my mouth.\n\nSo, unlike you, I would have just pushed the ice cream away and said, \"Tell me what you need me to know. I don't enjoy cutesy games and tricks.\" I am always very up front about not liking stuff like that though. so saying it out loud would never come as a surprise around me.\n\nAt any rate, I get that she staged a surprise for you. But, I also get that you weren't into it and NEVER expected that and so were unprepared to be gracious.\n\nNAH. Now she knows that a pee stick in your ice cream is not something that makes you humbled with joy and grace. \n\nAnd her friend can STHU. Not her business to comment upon. She'd not be welcome around me until she learns some manners, frankly.", "NTA.  You are being bullied by those women.  They did that deliberately.", "NTA. Anyone who desecrates ice cream like that should be imprisoned. \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA. Very juvenile", "NTA \"Hmn, this ice cream taste weird...\" \"It is the new pee-flavor, like it?\" \n\nA pregnancy test has little cracks where the pee goes in. Especially the cheaper ones. You can't get this clean with washing. And i wouldn't be surprised if she just run in under some water...", "NTA - what a gross way to announce good news. That was for her and her \"fans\" and not for you at all. A shame because you deserve to be told in a better way than licking a (cleaned) piss stick", "Tell her you may, or may not, have peed on her toothbrush. Oh, and then washed it off.
