They could've offered to fix it for you or give you a deal for next time to make everyone's experience better.", "NTA. I\u2019ll tip if they do a good job and exude good customer service. In fact, I feel inclined to tip. \n\nSome of these barbers set themselves up for failure though. Charging crazy prices, nickel and diming for basic services, and not even having proper etiquette or customer service", "Nta, a tip is for exceptional service not for doing half a job, but you shouldn\u2019t have left with it looking that bad", "NTA They did a bad job. Here\u2019s a Tip: the shop has no bearing on whether or not it will be any good. It\u2019s the stylist. Some cut good and some don\u2019t. Next time you get a good cut, ask their name so you can get booked in with them again. Otherwise you\u2019re rolling the dice.", "NTA, a tip is a recognition for good service, not an obligation.", "It is shocking to me that you have to tip your barber. Is this the USA?", "NTA\u2026I\u2019m not from the U.S so excuse me BUT have you guys reached the point where you tip your barber? That would be insane where I\u2019m from..", "Info: why did you leave if you weren\u2019t satisfied with the haircut? Was it to the point it couldn\u2019t be fixed? I think your absolutely allowed to not tip whenever you want though so NTA", "NTA - you earn a tip, it is not an automatic addition. If you don't give good service, you don't deserve a tip.", "INFO: not tipping is fine if they fucked up, but why wouldn't you expect them to fix it?", "I mean, why would you leave without letting them fix it, or at least telling them they screwed up?\n\nAll they know is that you're a jerk for not leaving a tip. You gave them nothing to go on. So while they sucked for doing a bad job, you sucked for not calling them out so I'ma go with ESH, but nothing to do with the tip part.", "My hairdresser\u2019s shop is close to where I live. I visit him frequently. Whenever we\u2019re done, he would say \u201cthat would be $20\u201d. I would give him $20 and say goodbye. I visit him frequently. He is always happy to see me.", "NTA. also you dont have to tip a hair dresser.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, I would've been honest with the barber and let him know that his service was terrible, that's why you didn't tip him.", "INFO: did you say anything to the barber? If it's not what you want, you need to say something. Either the barber can fix it, someone more experienced can fix it or they can comp the service. But if you don't say anything and just go no tip, they just think that you're an AH and don't necessarily know that there is a problem.", "NTA. Your tipping culture is out of control when you feel guilty for not tipping someone who did such a bad job with your hair that people are actually laughing at you. So my understanding from multiple posts is that tipping waiters is almost mandatory because they are so low paid. Are hairdressers also massively underpaid? And if not, why do you feel obliged to tip for mediocre and poor service?\nI live in the UK and have tipped my hairdresser precisely twice, when she did an extraordinary job. Given I pay \u00a3200 for a haircut and colour, paying extra on top seems absurd to me, unless the occasion really warrants it.", "Yes, and just like wait staff, tips are a significant part of stylist income", ">Was it to the point it couldn\u2019t be fixed?\n\nIt was ~~literally~~ basically [this meme](https://media.tenor.com/GYIemY4RPA4AAAAC/barber-shop-among-us.gif)", "They cut it way too short, I don't even think it could be fixed", "Would you want someone who basically fucked up your hair to \"try\" and fix it. Not a chance.  Thats just going to make it much worse.\n\nOP should have stated his dissatisfaction with the cut though.  If this is a chain type place, there is always a manager they can address the issue with.", "You mean, he's so good at customer service that he doesn't even wince when he sees the frequent non-tipper. What's he supposed to do, demand a tip? That's just asking for a bad review.", "That really depends. If you\u2019re going to a salon the shampoo attendant and the other \u201csecondary\u201d staff make shit wages. If they do a good job you absolutely should tip them.", "I feel like this in an extreme exaggeration and if it\u2019s not, you still could have asked for a discount, and informed them of the mistake. (Without being rude about it ofc.)\n\nSo while you\u2019re N(necessarily)TA you still should have communicated better and should have at least tried to right the wrong.\n\nTo compare, I used to be a waiter.\n\nIf I somehow gave you another tables food, and you leave me a $0 tip for it without saying anything, how am I supposed to understand the mistake that was made and try to right the wrong? Also I\u2019m just going to *assume* that you are in fact an asshole and be annoyed knowing that my pay was deducted for a mistake that could\u2019ve been fixed."]}
