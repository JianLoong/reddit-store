Tomorrow, I am travelling down to my mum\u2019s and letting her know she will not hear from me or see my son again.\n\nThank you for all of the support and help in the comments, this has been one hell of a day. I will be sure to update you all tomorrow if that is something you would all be interested in! \n\n* UPDATE* \nI have just apologised to my mum for being short with her, I have offered to swap it round every other year so that she can have the whole of Christmas day next year and then my fiance\u2019s family can choose either Boxing Day or Christmas Eve. \n\nShe told me to F**k myself and that \u201c blood is thicker than water\u201d\n\nI\u2019m at a loss. I feel heartbroken.\n\n\n\nI (20F) and my fiance (22M) have a son (1) together.\n\nSince our son was born, my mum seems to be in constant competition (in her head) with my fiance\u2019s family. There is no reason for this, my mum has had six kids of her own including me so I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s making things awkward/difficult.\n\nMy mum starts Christmas shopping really early, and she has been buying things all year for our son ready for Christmas day( which we are so grateful for and didn\u2019t expect so much), but that\u2019s including things I have asked her not to purchase (stand up toy table) because my fianc\u00e9s family were hoping to buy it for him, she bought him one anyway.\n\nOur original plan for Christmas was to travel down early in the morning to my mum\u2019s (she lives 1.5 hrs away) to celebrate with her and my younger sisters has the Christmas magic is very much still alive there. And then we would make the journey back up to our city and have Christmas dinner with my fiance\u2019s family (all adults, our son is the baby of the family). Then we will go to my fiance\u2019s Nans, for a chilled evening playing games like monopoly.\n\nMy mum is fuming!! She doesn\u2019t want us to share Christmas with my fiance\u2019s family and her, her argument for this is: \u201c you see his family every week, you live in the same city, yet you only come down to see us every two weeks\u201d.\n\nNow, cost of living is really buggering us. Sometimes we are living week to week. And fuel is expensive! \n\nIt seems as though every phone call we have recently contains subtle digs towards my partners family. And I\u2019m not having it! And the topic of sharing Christmas Day always comes up.\n\nSo I told her over the phone in anger  \u201c will you just zip it? If you don\u2019t want to share Christmas Day fine. You can choose to have either boxing day or Christmas Eve for us to spend it with you.\u201d And then I hung up.\n\nSince then, I have been getting texts from my side of the family, calling me out of my behaviour towards my mum.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I should cancel Christmas plans with everyone else just to suit my mum. She said she wants a whole day for herself so I gave her the options. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\nNotes to add:\nThe reason we see fianc\u00e9s family more is because they come over to ours often, my mum refuses to drive down because \u201c it\u2019s too long\u201d.\n\nIn terms of the table , she refuses to have any toys left there for my little boy, her house is like a show home and my son\u2019s toys \u201cmake it look messy\u201d.\n\n", "created_utc": 1698153513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fcmau/aita_for_telling_my_mum_to_zip_it_and_pick/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only way she will learn this is if you assert yourself now. \n\nEnjoy Christmas Day with your fiance's family. I hope it is joyful and stress-free.

She\u2019s not respecting you and your fianc\u00e9 at all. Have you guys been living on your own long? Has she ever met his side? I can understand that it takes some getting used to for a parent whose kid is having their own life and family, but that\u2019s a her problem. Do you guys talk to each other pretty consistently? If so, it makes me wonder if she could have a codependency issue. I\u2019d say stick to your guns and if she can\u2019t respect that then that\u2019s all on her.", "NTA - holidays with two families are hard. You're on the right track with setting firm boundaries. Boundaries are the hardest to enforce inside the family (that's been my experience, at least). I personally wouldn't want to travel 1.5 hours there and back on Christmas with a slew of other activities planned, so I think you're being more than generous even offering to split the day.", "Definitely NTA, your mom is tho.", "NTA - your choice of words were poor but you can\u2019t please everyone and it is annoying to be constantly having the same conversation over and over again.", "NTA.  I think the situation could've been handled better, but I assume its from a lot of things she's done previously (about wanting to be the fav Grandma etc).  Unfortunately, on days like Christmas, they are really important to most people, so I commend you for splitting your time evenly with each family.  Your mum needs to understand that as much as she doesn't like it, she does have to share you guys.  I hope things get sorted out for you x", "INFO: what was Christmas like when you were a kid? Did your family visit all your grandparents on the actual day?", "NTA! Your mom is  selfish and manipulative. Furthermore her going to \"the family\" to badger you is uncalled for and bullying. You gave her a reasonable choice: part of Christmas day or all of another day. She is choosing instead a rude all or nothing. Stick to your guns or you are going to have to fight this battle every year. Good luck!", "NTA. She\u2019s being so unreasonable. The holiday season is about *family* and that includes your fianc\u00e9\u2019s side. She needs to just zip it like you said and needs to get over it. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019d really reconsider going to your mom\u2019s. She needs a wake up call. \n\nAs for the presents thing - could she just use the same toys she bought to keep at her house? My mom has done this a couple times (without knowing) and we just end up having her keep the toys at her house for when we go over to visit. But it\u2019s very disrespectful of your mom to knowingly buy presents she knows others want to get your child.", "NTA. Her demands will get worse if you give in to her.", "Once we had kids my wife and I decided that we're staying home for Christmas. Anyone and everyone is invited to stop by as they want and dinners at 3, let us know in advance if you're planning to be here for dinner.", "NAH, holidays are hard, and your mom may have a small point if you do see your in-laws more due to the convenience. I see you offered Christmas eve to your mom, have you thought about going on Christmas eve and spending the night and proceeding with your plans that way?", "Nta. The best way to celebrate is to do it in your own home. It doesn't matter what size of space you have. Everyone knows it. They can either be crammed in together or they can choose their own day to celebrate.", "Nta, your mom is expecting you to change how you spend Christmas now you have a kid. She set expectations and that was unfair of her. If she wants a whole day then she can pick one of the daya you offer especially since her bf doesn\u2019t want you guys to spend the night. No one really wants to travel that far at night with a baby.\n\nYour mom on only being interested in your child for ten minutes is either she could just want the pictures or this isnt the age she loves. My dad loves when you can start to play with them by tickling and tossing.", "Nah. You need to rotate holidays.  Speaking from experience my two older children put everyone but me first.  Even When if I ask first and they have no plans. So I do Thanksgiving and my two youngest children (still in college) always come home. Balance is key here.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH\n\nTrying to balance family commitments at Christmas is a logistic and emotional minefield. Everyone wants to see the little one (understandably) but travelling around with a newborn is not fun at all. \n\nI\u2019m guessing your mum wants to see you for Christmas dinner, not just presents so is probably hurt and being childish as a result. \n\nCan I suggest the Vicar of Dibley option?", "Not really, OP. I totally understand your frustration and I empathize with you. \n\nThis is just my suggestion, as I\u2019m a little older (44M) and I have had to apologize to my parents for my younger days in the past. \n\nEven though you know you think you\u2019re right, just call her back and apologize. And then try to work out something together that makes her happy for Christmas.\n\nJust tell her you love her very much (I hope you do at least) and tell her you\u2019re just currently stressed out with having to plan everything (as an excuse if you need to use one). I promise you\u2019ll thank me later on in life, and you\u2019ll make your mom very happy now.  \n\nAnyway, I appreciate you sharing this and hope you have a great day, OP. Take care!", "INFO: How did you do it before the kid was born?\n\nFrom the moment my partner and I started living together we have been doing xmas eve with one family, xmas lunch with the other and switch it up every year and there's no reason to change it once our baby is here (it will only be next year).\n\nSplitting xmas between both families makes total sense to me, it's just a matter of defining how the split is done.\n\nBtw, regardless of who's right saying \"zip it\" to your mother is definitely not ok", "NTA. Tell your Mom that she cannot buy another thing for your son. And take the table back.  \nWhen I had my 1st child, we told everyone we were no longer traveling for Christmas, and family was invited to our house. I felt like we needed to start our own traditions. No one was mad. As for gifts...after my oldest literally opened maybe   25 -30 gifts Christmas morning, then looking at me and saying - is that all? I was horrified. I started the rule with family: ONE gift, if they wanted to, and it had to be something educational, or a T-shirt from a favorite trip they had taken.\n Christmas was 3 gifts from Santa, and 2 from Mom & Dad. My parents bought a small gift and a savings bond. And it took the pressure off my in-laws to compete with other family.", "Based on the update NTA. Really it has to be that specific day. Maybe you should just keep Christmas with you baby and husband. Spend day after with other family", "NTA - Sounds like my mum and we live in the same fecking town! However across the last few years I've gone non-contact with her and life couldn't be simpler! Now we split our Christmases between my dad/step-mum and my in-laws. It works great and sometimes it marries up with seeing family from Bristol, sometimes it doesn't. Just how it works.\n\nYour mum is being silly, making up scenarios in her own head about how you're being 'stolen' by your in-laws to be, create boundaries but tell her if she wants to visit you more, feel free. You'll likely see she doesn't want to make the effort (however this is only my experience, never stopped my mum seeing my kids).", "NTA\n\n\nStart a tradition of doing Xmas day at yours and have others visit you? Your siblings sound young enough to still believe in Christmas magic but are probably older so will be easier for them to travel than it will be for with a young baby? As for presents I agree with others who say give a budget or set a limit, if you think she is going to overstep ( she definitely will) then give each family a list of presents that you think are best and don't have any duplicates. Only exception to this would be if they want to buy cute clothes.\n\nSet the boundaries here and now else she will push for more and more every year.", "NTA. Your mum\u2019s behaviour is toxic AF. Does she not realise that your fianc\u00e9s family are blood relatives to your son as well and deserve the same access and respect? If she is so desperate to see you more often then she should come to you and not the other way around. \n\nWe get out of this by refusing to see anyone in Xmas day. Family can have us day before or day after but Xmas day is for us and the kids. \n\nOn Xmas the extent of effort I go to for getting dressed is putting a bras on. I have no desire to make an effort to get up and travel anywhere or cook beyond what I need for our family. \n\nThat is my present to me. \n\nBut then I am an introvert and large social gatherings cause me anxiety and I prefer to hide than see people.", "NTA and if the kid gets second gifts what my SIL did with her kids was leave the extra toy at grandma's house and then they had one to play with there aswell. If mom gives him the toy table then say thank you and leave it there for him to play with because he's already got one at home from the other in-laws. If she gets the picture she can't railroad your wishes and requests.", "I wont say you are the asshole\u2026 \n\nBut if i were to put myself in your mom shoes. You see his family every week, and u wont even share the actual Christmas day to celebrate with your mother? Something that she is soo excited and begin preparation so early ahead?\n\nIf i were your mother, i probably think that you never prioritize her enough to spend at least 1 full day with her.\n\nAgain i dont hv much information to make a conclusion\n\nHow often do you see her usually?\nHow important Christmas is to her?\nDoes your mom always nitpick and behave like that?", "NTA. But it might be time to trade off. One year she gets Christmas Eve next year the day.", "NTA. This is going to be an issue for every holiday so you and your partner should figure out what works for your family now. Driving all day on Christmas is going to get old really fast so set up another day with either your mother or your partner's family. Maybe Christmas eve with your mother where you can spend the day with her and Christmas with his family.", "A Da", "NTA.  THere's nothing magical about the actual holiday DAY.  You can celebrate a holiday any time you want.   \n\nI had a friend whose family had Christmas during Memorial Day weekend, because there was no snow and ice to worry about, and they could have a big blowout family party out in the country.     My sister was a nurse, and they always had to work at least one holiday, so our family celebrated Christmas (or Thanksgiving) on any day that she wasn't working.", "Nope, NTA.  Your mum needs a chill pill!", "NTA, it\u2019s a holiday, you\u2019re doing your best. My Mom was a fan of, we celebrate whenever we like and she never put pressure on any of us. Your Mom is entitled and she\u2019s setting up a terrible dynamic. \n\nTell mumsie she can visit you if she wants more contact.", "NTA. And let his family buy the table. Get it first, then tell your mom, darn, I told you that his family was getting this for him. Well, if you don\u2019t have a receipt we can leave it at your house and when he comes over he can play with it here. \n\nShe is doing her best to shut your in-law family out.", "NTA- but I\u2019m going to assume that your mom is worried she\u2019s going to be pushed to the side in your baby\u2019s life and is overcompensating.", "NTA but how about doing Christmas with Mum and Boxing Day with his family? Next year you switch to local Christmas and travel to Mum on Boxing Day", "Hold is thicker than water\u2026.the biggest guilt trip from your mother.", "Technically, the mum is also blood with the in laws- through her dear grandson. NTA- Mum needs to know not to do this shit", "So only her blood is thicker than water? What about your fianc\u00e9s blood?  Is it not thicker than water with his family?  Your mom needs to grow up.  Just the fact that you are going to be traveling so much in one day is stressful, add to that a baby.  \n\nA compromise is to give one family Christmas Eve, the other Christmas Day.  Swap that every year.  If she can not compromise she does not deserve anything at all.  She's being an immature AH. I'm sorry she's stressing you out, you are Not the AH here.", "NTA!!!  Oh honey, you need to set your boundaries and stick to them now or your future will be dictated by your mother.  First, kudos to you for standing up as you did!  You've clearly thought this through and came up with a solution that includes everyone!  Second, YOU get to choose where and how you spend your holidays and celebrations.  You and your fiance make the decisions for your family - no one else gets a vote (unless you ask them)!  You can stay home and have people come to your house, you can go round robin to other families houses, you can rotate holiday days as a whole if you want.

A few years ago, his younger sister had a baby and suddenly his parents were making plans around her schedule.  This was totally fine with us, but they expected everyone to bend to their demands, including last minute changes that no one told him about. My husband is gone for weeks at a time for work and cannot just change his schedule last minute. Also, I have a son and he typically spends Christmas eve with his dad, and comes home in the late morning. My adult daughter also has 2 girls and they always come out for a while on Christmas day. There are a lot of logistics and we try to be flexible, but his mother basically told him to kick the grandkids out after a half hour so we could drive an hour+ to do Christmas there because that's what his sister wanted in order to accommodate her in-laws. \n\nAnyway, they ended up coming to an agreement on when we would all get together and then went behind his back and had the \"family Christmas\" without him and didn't tell him. He only found out because someone let it slip.  It caused a major rift between him and his family that persists to this day, 3 years later. \n\nSince this whole fiasco, we've decided we're doing Christmas at home. The kids and grandkids come out, spend whatever time they want to spend and no one is pressured to do anything they don't want to.

Totally relaxed, no pressure, and no travel. \n\nOP you need to do what's best for your family and start making your own traditions.  If your mom wants to see you, she can come to you if it's so terribly important that it happen on Christmas day.

And manipulative, she doesn't want you to take any decisions she's not okeyed first. \n\n- gifts on her terms\n\n- xmas on her terms\n\n- won't visit, again, her terms\n\n- distespects your inlaws because she thinks she's way better\n\nWhat else in your life have you had to concede to her, to be left in peace and be considered part of the family? Keep firm on this and enjoy xmas on your terms. You're an adult", "Is there a reason she can\u2019t drive to see you? \n\nEvery wants to see everyone around the holidays and someone always gets but hurt for no reason this year it\u2019s your mom. Absolutely don\u2019t cancel any plans to make her happy bc that will become the norm. NTA", ">UPDATE\\* I have just apologised to my mum for being short with her, I have offered to swap it round every other year so that she can have the whole of Christmas day next year and then my fiance\u2019s family can choose either Boxing Day or Christmas Eve.\r  \n\r  \nShe told me to F\\*\\*k myself and that \u201c blood is thicker than water\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m at a loss. I feel heartbroken.\n\nI'm sorry your mum is so rigid. Your compromise was fine, and her response was uncalled for. Does she not understand that applies to your fiance and his family as well? And to your son as to both sides?\n\nIt's unfortunate, but you'll have to live with her decision - and so will she. Hopefully, when she lives with it for a year, she will change her mind and realize that being so rigid doesn't get her what she wants, in fact, she gets less than what she had. I'm sorry she's casting this pall over the holidays for you all. Try not to let it affect your upcoming good times, as whether she realizes it now or not, she has chosen the short end of the stick, and if she truly wanted to spend the time, she went about it in 100% the wrong way. Not only in this specific instance, but in denigrating your fiance's family. Her action have consequences, and perhaps she will begin to understand.", "You need to put your mom in her place or she's only going to get worse. Don't go. Tell her she can either see you when you say so or not at all. And that's such crap about blood is thicker than water, you are seeing your other family! Our family always did Christmas eve with one family and Christmas day with the other. It's just a day I never understood why everyone freaks out. And you mom certainly can travel to you easier than it is for you to go to her. Put your immediate family first and let mom decide if she's going to be reasonable or not. It's her choice.", "Don't know what crawled up your mom's ass and died, but holy fuck.\n\nEither she needs to come see you for the holiday or you should just go to your bf's family/nan's. Spend longer time with both.", "NTA \n\nWe've been dealing that with my MIL for YEARS. She's horribly jealous and insecure - of me, of my mom, of my spouse's time, my spouse's emotions, every thing.   \nWe've been low contact for awhile, and after the latest holiday argument, likely going no contact. She's appalled that there's no time for dinner or holidays this year, after all the awful stressful ones, and with my spouse's new job (12 hour overnights, 4+ nights a week) there really isn't a lot of availability.   \nDon't skip the other holiday events. Those people and those relationships are important too. We're still saddened by the compromises and efforts we went to to try and make her happy, and since she  was so worked up about the holidays, the events we spent with her  were awful. \n\nThere  will  never be a reason valid enough. She's your mother, and  she believes that that means she should be your first priority.   \nDon't just set boundaries, enforce them. You'll arrive when you do, stay as long as you plan to,  and  you'll leave when you need to.", "OP, I'm so sorry to hear this update. I'm sorry that your mum has decided \"blood is thicker than water\" means \"shut up and do what mum says\", not \"do what is best for the baby\". As if your son is not related by blood to your fiance's family.\n\nThis is going to be a painful time. Your mum thinks that she can break you down, and until she realizes that she can't, she will try harder and harder and hurt you more and more. It's not your fault. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean it won't hurt.\n\nMaybe \"every two weeks\" is too often to see someone who says horrible things to you.", "NTA\n\nDon't waste your time with your Mom. She's a Narcissistic control freak. You're an adult. You're a parent now. If you don't want to spend all of Christmas Day with your mother, then you don't have to. And if she can't be arsed to drive an hour and a half to see you, then oh well, I guess she doesn't get to see you.", "Yikes - I would have voted NTA just based on your original post but based on update 2, not only are you NTA, but your mom is unhinged!", "NTA and the original meaning behind \n\n>\u201c blood is thicker than water\u201d\n\nIs\n\n\"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\"\n\nWhich means the family you pick is more important than the family you are born to. \n\nGood job choosing \ud83d\udc4f", "If she gets 'stupid' tell her you will put the audio in social media. Seems like she only lives to be praised there.", "\"As the parents, YOU make the Christmas plans now.\"\n\n#truth", "Yep! When we were newly married we traveled 5 hours to visit our families - then every other year another 5 hours for New Year's.\n\nAfter kids we laid down the new rules. We will travel for Thanksgiving, but our Christmas will be at our house. Everyone was welcome to visit, but no more 5 hour trips with three kids.", "Thankyou, my partner and I have been together for five years, we moved into our first home together, almost 3 years ago. And our families have met many times.\n\nI chat to my mum every day, the same conversations over the phone had been going on for about 3 months, even when we visited, she would put my fianc\u00e9s family down in front of him.", "It only takes one year of spliting a holiday between two locations for young marrieds to decide that it isn't worth the drive time.", "When I was a kid my siblings and I would just go to my nans, parents would be out partying", "Yes this is what we originally wanted to do, my mums new bf doesn\u2019t want us to stay the night ( the only place we could sleep is the lounge on the sofa bed) because he wants to set up the lounge for my little sisters to wake up to. So sadly this is not an option. :(", "My son loves a tickle, I firmly believe my mum only likes to see him to get photos to post on Facebook :(", "My mum doesn\u2019t cook Christmas dinner, so I think it is just the fact she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cshare\u201d, I just feel torn. I\u2019m trying my best to make everyone happy, including ourselves, \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do", "Yes, we have done it this way every year, my sisters are still quite young, so we have always spent the morning with my mum, so we can see the Christmas magic in my sisters eyes opening Father Christmas presents. And then having dinner and the afternoon at my partners family as they are all adults and we can enjoy the evening watching a quiet film/having a couple of drinks.", "My oldest opening birthday presents (many in bags), was oohing and ahhing over every one, we were outside so putting stuff back in bags as they came out. They begin to open one already open and they got even more excited than the first time around because they thought they had gotten an exact duplicate to give to their sibling to have. It was so funny. Kids can be so cute they get so excited about the prospect of opening the gifts.\n\nWe also try limiting toys and whatnot. We just don\u2019t have the space. And we are very anti waste.", "Another bit to add for context:\n\nHow often does OP\u2019s mom make the drive to visit? \n\nI\u2019ve been in OP\u2019s shoes as the one to move away, and everyone always expects me to drive/fly back to visit. It gets really annoying being the only one to make the effort year in and year out. Over 20 years later and my family knows not to bug me about visiting anymore. They are always welcome to visit me, but I\u2019ll visit them when I\u2019m ready to make the trip. (Closest family is over 1,000 miles away from me.)", "We wanted to separate the day evenly with the family. My mum has the morning, my fiance\u2019s family have the afternoon. But she didn\u2019t want to share the day.\n\nWe travel down once every two weeks to spend a full day with my mum, while we are there, she will play with our son for a maximum of 10 minutes and take loads of photos of him, she will then put him on the floor and not bother again until we next travel down to see her.\n\nShe does love Christmas, but she has only been acting like this since our son was born", "This is what we were hoping, but my mum wasn\u2019t happy with that either x", "Bless. I'm about to embark upon a 15-hour trip with a 1-year-old for Thanksgiving and it might be my last ever.", "Time to tell her that the constant digs on fianc\u00e9s family must stop and warn her when she makes those comments the call will end.  Then when she does it, do exactly that, \u201cmom, I told you this topic is unacceptable, we can try again another time, good bye\u201d and hang up.  She will learn quickly if she wants to keep in contact.", "She's acting like this because you allow her to. Put your foot down and stand up for YOUR family, your fiance and your baby. Mom can decide if she wants to be part of the family or not. Being part means being kind and loving and realizing seeing the grandchild is a privilege nit a right", "It's so stressful! My friends used to split it FOUR WAYS because both set of parents were divorced. I asked why they didn't split the four celebrations over two days, and their response was \"Christmas Eve is just for us - no one gets that day\". It was their day of sanity before the day of excess.", "We would spend Thanksgiving with one family and Christmas with the other, then rotate each year. It was so much easier.", "I just wanted to jump on your last comment to respond to your update.  Don't let your Mom upset you. You are the Mom now. You need to give your child a stress free Happy Christmas. You see your Mom every 2 weeks. Just because she is your Mother she does NOT get to order you around. Your fiance's family is your child's blood. Your fiance is your CHOSEN family. We are unfortunately born into families and don't have a choice who we get. You get to choose your friends and loved ones yourself. You can also choose to leave toxic family behind. \n\nFollow your heart. Ignore the one causing this pain.", "It\u2019s possible. Hope she just likes a different age and gets more involved with your son.", "What are their thoughts on New Years? That might be a way to compromise. Maybe one gets Christmas Eve and Hogmanay and the other side of the family gets Christmas day?", "If it has always been this way I don't see a reason to change it just because you have a kid.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd it's always fun to see different traditions :D In my country the Xmas eve's dinner is much more important than the day itself :D", "In that case def NTA :\u2019)", "Sad that jealousy gets in the way of people understanding the situation for what it is. Just do it your way and let her stew until she's ready to compromise.", "I hope so too, thank you", "No one\u2019s really bothered about new years :( my partner, and I normally go out for a date night x", "Oh God \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I think you might have to do alternate years then\u2026"]}
