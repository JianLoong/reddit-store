Her sisters haven\u2019t met them yet but my SIL does send them pics. \n\nShe usually only sends pictures of the boys but apparently she sent a family one and the two started to make fun of her weight, of being the \u201codd one out\u201c in terms of looks, and yeah. Apparently my SIL cried a lot and my brother blocked them from her phone. \n\nSadly, the damage was done.\n\nShe became very self conscious of her weight. She\u2019s now on a diet and exercises way more than I think is appropriate. She\u2019s already lost a lot of weight but I don\u2019t think she plans on stopping. My brother\u2019s trying to support her and tells her that she shouldn\u2019t listen to her sisters. She just tells him that they\u2019re right and that she doesn\u2019t understand how he was okay with how she looked.\n\nShe unblocked her sisters behind my brother\u2019s back and texts them often for advice which is just them shaming her. I only know about this because her phone was blowing up so I grabbed it to give it to her and noticed the names on the notifications and asked her. She admitted it and begged me not to tell my brother. She told me to keep it between us girls claiming my brother wouldn\u2019t understand. I just said sure. \n\nBut my brother told me she\u2019s getting worse and it was honestly really depressing. I told my brother.\n\nHe was very thankful. I don\u2019t know what happened between them but my SIL called me some time later and it was clear that she\u2019d been crying. She said that I promised to keep it a secret and she can\u2019t believe I broke her trust like that. She said that she was even more offended that I didn\u2019t trust her and told on her like she was some baby. \n\nWhen I tried explaining that I was concerned she told me to shut up and said that there\u2019s nothing to be concerned about and that I should mind my own fucking business from now on instead of snooping through her phone and manipulating her trust. She seemed really distressed and I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I messed things up. \n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have told my brother. I clearly don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through and maybe she has a valid reason for not telling her husband. I don\u2019t know, she\u2019s never ever yelled like that before and my heart still hurts.

She needs real help maybe therapy. You did the right thing.", "Nta - your SIL needs some professional help, maybe she\u2019s suffering from PPD. Her sisters are a bad influence on her mental health but she relies on them for external validation for a reason that a therapist could help her unpack. Hiding the fact that she\u2019s back in contact with her toxic sisters from her husband prevents him from successfully supporting her.", "NTA because it sounds like she\u2019s developing an eating disorder because of how horrible her sisters are being to her. She\u2019s not a child, but her husband does need to put his foot down and insist that she see the doctor with him involved in the appointment. Maybe you and he can sit down with her together and tell her that you both love her and this is becoming dangerous and emotionally damaging for her. I think you should offer to babysit while they go to the doctor\u2019s office and maybe while he supports her at her first dozen Overeater\u2019s Anonymous meetings. I would also look up those support meetings (they are for all kinds of disordered eating from Anorexia to severe overeating) it might be really beneficial for her to hear others talking about their struggles even if she doesn\u2019t want to actively participate. \nThis might be a form of postpartum anxiety too. I think that her OB might be a good doctor to start with especially if that\u2019s a doctor she has a good connection with already. If she hated her OB then I would recommend seeing a general practitioner instead and going from there. Her jerk sisters are creating anxiety in her, but that can be easier to do with hormonal changes following birth and also how much pregnancy changes your body too.", "NTA,\n\nYou were trying to *protect* your SIL, having her best interests at heart.\n\nToxic family can be a serious drain, especially if you don't recognize them as such.  Your SIL is twice a victim.\n\nOnce for being bullied\n\nOnce for being manipulated by family (the ones who should have her back but don't.)", "NTA\n\nAnd she doesn't get to flip the script on you here about lying and betraying trust when she misled your brother", "Nta. You did the right thing", "NTA. Secrets shouldn\u2019t hurt. That\u2019s what we teach our children, and sometimes adults need to be reminded of that.", "NTA. Sounds like she needs a counselor.", "NTA. You expressed a concern and tried to help the best you could.

You SIL needs medical help.", "NAH you and your brother were trying to help her which is fair. also she\u2019s obviously going through something and of course she\u2019s not going to leave her sisters that she obviously has a relationship with (for better or worse) unblocked", "Ugh, tough one.  But I'll have to go with YTA, though I may be swayed otherwise.  \n\nI take things told to me in confidence very very very seriously.  It's a cornerstone of my profession. \n\nI think that for having broken her trust you've accomplished nothing.  She will find a way to be in touch with her sisters if that's what she wants to do.  She will keep losing weight if she wants to.  If you thought her methods were dangerous you could have told your brother about the behavior without mentioning the sisters.  \n\nShe is going to the sisters for tips at this point.  Not talking to them isn't going to magically make her not want to lose weight and she will just go to the internet and find the same fucked up strategies. \n\nShe probably needs to be in therapy but nothing about what you've done is going to get her there in my opinion.", "ESH. Well you and your brother. Your brother has no business blocking anyone on someone else's phone. And if you decided you couldn't keep her secret, you should have told her first.", "YTA. \nThe only reason you obtained this information is because you grabbed her phone unprompted and, whether it was intentional or no, looked at it without her consent.  \n\nWhat is more, she is an adult. She gets to decide who she has in her life and who she blocks from it. This has nothing to do with you. And ultimately, it has nothing to do with her husband; he doesn\u2019t get to decide either. All he can do is be as supportive as he can as she navigates her body image issues.", "YTA. You should have realized that she finds motivation from her inspiring sisters. In fact, you should have joined in. The three of you could circle around her pointing and laughing. Or my personal favorite, recreate game of thrones and have her walk down the street while everyone yells \"SHAME SHAME SHAME\"\n\nYou really missed an opportunity to bring the best out of her, OP. Most people pay Tony Robbins and other self help gurus thousands of dollars to find that inner motivation, but instead you sent her right back to the couch. Might as well of handed her a ben n Jerry ice cream and spoonfed her yourself. \n\nTrust, ANNIHILATED.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She had TWINS 6 months ago! The things her body went through to get those boys here safely was no easy task and she, nore anyone else, should not expect her to be back in shape so soon.

Your brother has a ton of stuff to do already, she will contact her sisters if she wants to.  Which means they will be in her head anyways. The difference being that she now feels like she doesn't have an ally in you.  \n\nI think the better approach may have been to push your brother into getting her into therapy based on her behavior.

If so it's very likely she's not only decreasing her overall supply, but causing it to be less nutritious.\n\nWhen she lashes out at you like this, try and remember you're talking to the ED, not her.
