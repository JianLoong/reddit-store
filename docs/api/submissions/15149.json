She seemed really distressed and I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I messed things up. \n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have told my brother.

She\u2019s not a child, but her husband does need to put his foot down and insist that she see the doctor with him involved in the appointment. Maybe you and he can sit down with her together and tell her that you both love her and this is becoming dangerous and emotionally damaging for her. I think you should offer to babysit while they go to the doctor\u2019s office and maybe while he supports her at her first dozen Overeater\u2019s Anonymous meetings. I would also look up those support meetings (they are for all kinds of disordered eating from Anorexia to severe overeating) it might be really beneficial for her to hear others talking about their struggles even if she doesn\u2019t want to actively participate. \nThis might be a form of postpartum anxiety too. I think that her OB might be a good doctor to start with especially if that\u2019s a doctor she has a good connection with already. If she hated her OB then I would recommend seeing a general practitioner instead and going from there.

She will keep losing weight if she wants to.  If you thought her methods were dangerous you could have told your brother about the behavior without mentioning the sisters.  \n\nShe is going to the sisters for tips at this point.

She gets to decide who she has in her life and who she blocks from it. This has nothing to do with you. And ultimately, it has nothing to do with her husband; he doesn\u2019t get to decide either. All he can do is be as supportive as he can as she navigates her body image issues.", "YTA. You should have realized that she finds motivation from her inspiring sisters.

Today seems to be the hatching day for a new group", "NTA\n\nYour concerns are valid. Your sister probably has post partum depression. It would be wise for your brother to talk to her about this immediately and get her medical help.", "It would have been better to talk to her .  She's not going to trust you now.", "NTA - this sounds like something much more serious, almost like it could be headed towards an ED. I am not diagnosing, just recognizing patterns. You did the right thing.", "NTA, you concerns for her well being are commendable. Her sisters suck, Just keep letting her know that she is loved, and beautiful, and that you are always there.", "NTA it sounds like your sister-in-law is struggling with an eating disorder or mental health issues, so I absolutely think you did the right thing", "nta, she should speak with a therapist, not her judgmental sisters", "This is why I say NAH except the sisters. Because the conflict is between SIL and OP. So NAH", "Ironically said while you browse this sub.", "We do the screening at all Ped appointments. My ped reviews it and we do have conversations about how I\u2019m handling things, what my support structure is like etc", "How about you try to be less dense and realize that the wife is an adult and gets to make bad choices\u2026unless the husband wants to challenge her competency through the courts.", "The wife consented to giving her husband some control over whom she talks to. She has now obviously withdrawn that consent and has decided to go back to speaking with her sisters. \n\nIf the husband feels the situation is serious enough, he can petition to have her committed or apply for conservatorship, much like what Britney Spears\u2019s father did.", "the situation was affecting her stfu in this situation its necessary thi is a type of self harm grow the hell up", "You\u2019re telling me to grow up, in the meantime typing juvenile insults. If you\u2019re going to get emotional about this, then maybe you should step away. \n\nAgain, adults are allowed to make bad choices unless there is a court order. Just because your spouse is making bad decisions doesn\u2019t give you the right to control her life without a legal instrument.", "so you want her to be brittney speared because shes currently struggling with PPD and needs  help besides just being completely controlled telling you to stfu and grow up arent insults im telling you what to do use your head here kiddo if you care for someone you some times have to do \"controlling\" or \"bad\" things", "YTA for agreeing to keep it a secret. You should have never agreed, then you wouldn't have to make a liar out of yourself. It's not SIL's fault that you actually did agree to keep the secret, so I won't say E S H. But you're right to tell your brother IMO, because she was being bullied and abused. You just should never have agreed not to tell him, when it was a lie.", "Ultimately NTA, but to her, ofc youre an AH. But sometimes it\u2019s necessary to be an AH to help someone we care about. Your SIL is in an abusive relationship with her sisters.", "NTA. You did break her trust, but you were forced to weigh breaking her trust with your concern for her health and well-being and personally I think you made the right choice, even if it might damage your relationship with her for a bit. \n\nI wonder if growing up with toxic, awful sisters like that has made it hard for her to believe that you would \u201ctell on\u201d her like that out of genuine concern and love for her rather than to hurt her or hold her back. Like she might not be able to see your motives clearly because no one has ever done something like that to help her in her experience. I think with therapy she\u2019ll come to understand and appreciate what you did.", "Honestly, this isn't a situation that can really be judged like this. This is beyond this sub.\n\nI'd be concerned that you've potentially severed a line of communication. SIL wouldn't talk to her partner, and now she definitely won't talk to you. I'm a bit worried this will just promote more secrecy from her.\n\nThis isn't in a \"you were completely wrong or the asshole way.\" It's just that this is a situation that is really hard to navigate, and honestly there probably isn't a strict right thing to do.\n\nThe best I can do is link some resources on dealing with eating disorders in the hopes it will help with further communication\n\nhttps://www.helpguide.org/articles/eating-disorders/helping-someone-with-an-eating-disorder.htm\n\nhttps://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/get-information-and-support/support-someone-else/tips-for-supporting-somebody-with-an-eating-disorder/\n\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline (this is a helpline, you'll be able to call them to get advice, assuming you are in the US. I'm sure there are similar helplines in other countries).", "NTA\n\nShe might have an ED, this is a \"see something, say something\" situation. Keeping a secret that impacts someone's health and wellbeing is irresponsible, and you were right to tell your brother. Your SIL needs help, emotionally for sure, and possibly medically if she's excessively exercising and restricting calories.", "YTA.  You told her you'd keep a secret and didn't.  It was kind of dumb to agree to that secrecy in the first place.  Instead, you should have said you wouldn't say anything if she told your brother the truth.  Then it is all on her, not you.  If you talk t her in the near future, tell her you will never again agree to keep secrets from your brother and she needs to not include you in such deceptions.", "How were you raised that you don\u2019t think telling someone to \u201cSTFU\u201d isn\u2019t an insult?   You ate telling another adult to be quiet (when you don\u2019t have to do so) and in a very disrespectful manner, while cursing at them and using the strongest curse word in human speech. \n\nAnd telling me to \u201cgrow up\u201d is definitely an insult, because it implies that I am a child when none of my comments are reflective of a juvenile age. I\u2019m speaking to you in a respectful manner, and I wish you would do the same to me. \n\nBut you just called me \u201ckiddo.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re incapable of respectful conversation if the other person doesn\u2019t agree with you.  Edit: and you also told me to \u201cuse my head .\u201d  Why do you talk to people like this?  \n\nAs far as Britney Spears, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what I want for the OP\u2019s wife. I\u2019m saying what the realistic options are if he feels she is a danger to herself. He can\u2019t physically stop her from communicating with her sisters without a court order.  \n\nAs for Britney herself, the conservatorship might have been the best thing for her."]}
