Tell her to write a 5k words oneshot before she opens her mouth", "NTA sounds as that friend is jealous of you, the making fun of you is out of insecurity.\n\nThe fact that she tried to delete your stuff, means you cant trust her with stuff that you hold dear, and thus care for.", "NTA\n\nEven if it was cringe (in my opinion it isn't) it's not her decision to do anything about it.  \nIf she had stopped after her first laugh (I think if she finds it funny/cringe she can't be blamed for laughing), all would have been cool but she decided to double down and that makes her a huge ahole.", "NTA, I keep a lot of my sentimental writing stuff too. A sounds like a jerk. Especially for making fun of it\n\nEdit: Also wanted to add that I also keep mine to see how much I\u2019ve improved as well. It\u2019s come in handy because while some of my past stuff might be considered \u201ccringe\u201d it\u2019s made me a better writer because I can see the mistakes I used to make and learn from them, and see how much the characters have developed over the years.", "NTA. Don't let her use your PC ever again for 1) snooping 2) hold it against you 3) attempt to delete your files.", "NTA at all. You don\u2019t treat other peoples stuff like that.", "NTA. I don't think I would ask her over anymore after this. This was mad disrespectful of her. Hobbies are not cringe and people that ridicule you for the things you love are not good friends.", "NTA but your friend sure is! She shouldn't have been snooping around your documents in the first place, but then it became 100 x worse when she criticised your writing and attempted to delete some of it. Even the best writers probably have cringeworthy first drafts on their computer, which, through revision, they later turn into well-crafted pieces of writing.", "NTA. She is, though, for trying to get rid of something that is yours. She is projecting when she called you immature. Find better friends.", "Excuse me???\n\nShe made fun of your artwork and then tried to delete it?? \n\nIn your own home, on your own computer, as your guest?! \n\nThe attempt would be egregious even if you hadn\u2019t gone on to publish your own work in more official capacities - as it is, talk about insult to injury. I can only imagine her jealousy that you stuck with a hobby and craft long enough to gain successes to your name. \n\nAbsolutely NTA\n\nShe\u2019s lost guest and friend privileges. If she doesn\u2019t apologize for her words and behavior - well, that about says it all.\n\nWith friends like these, who needs internet trolls?", "She should find a hobby and you should find a new friend. NTA", "NTA", "NTA, time to find new friends, not that she was your friend in the first place...", "NTA and there is no reality in which you did anything wrong. Your friend really crossed a line. A couple jokes,  sure,  then move on. But trying to delete them?  Nah, calling her out was the right thing to do.", "NTA.\n\nYou stuck up for yourself. A sounds like an immature idiot. Deleting other people's files with sentimental value? Mocking a friend's attempt at something artistic? Your friend is a cringelord.", "NTA.  Mocking someone\u2019s writing/art is hurtful and just not a nice thing for a friend to do in the first place but to go so far as to attempt to delete them?  Yeah, that\u2019s not a friend at all.", "Fun fact: \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d started as a fan fiction piece re \u201cTwilight.\u201d That lady made millions. Just saying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe had her behaviour reflected back to her and didn't like it. She fucker around and found out. \n\n\nGood for you", "NTA. Your reaction was appropriately harsh for someone who actually tried to delete your documents without permission. How dare she?", "Maaaan the sht I wrote when I was a teen is hella cringe, and I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to read that. None the less, it\u2019s a little piece of me that will always have a place in my heart and my laptop. \n\n  The only thing worth deleting here is her number. NTA", "NTA. Do to HER what she tried to do to your files. Delete her from your life because she\u2019s toxic! Good news: you DO have the password so you\u2019ll have no trouble completing the deletion process, Lol.\n\nAs to your desire to hang on to your old writings, this is perfectly normal for artists of all genres and mediums. It\u2019s not only a sentimental value thing, but it helps us improve over time. Stay true to yourself and get rid of that obnoxious busybody!", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s the one being immature. \nWhat\u2019s your writing got to do with her anyway.", "I'm 23 and sometimes I'm in the mood for the cringe fanfics I read when I was younger.  Hell, I seek out new ones every few months.  There's nothing wrong with that.  NTA.  I wouldn't even let her in the house after what she tried to do.  I'd block her.  Huge NTA", "NTA\n\nI wrote some proper lame fanfics as a teen but even now (I'm I my mid 30s) I still look back at them lol sad I know but it's my thing.\n\nAnyway, she had no business looking at all. She invaded your privacy after you were kind enough to let her play on your PC. That's not OK.", "NTA and get rid of the friend. Those attitudes, even if we think we have control over our mental state, can have long lasting, negative impacts. Don\u2019t let people in your life plant self-doubt and create a self saboteur.", "Nah, NTA. She made fun of something harmless that is important to you.\n\nCould it be that she was trying to joke and tease you? If yea she should have stopped the moment she saw it bothered you.\n\nYour reaction was good, she needs to grow up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
