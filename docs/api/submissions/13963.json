No one and I mean NO ONE has the right to delete it for any reason, idc. Writing is an art that changes in time. Your writers \"fingerprint\" and voice changes, your wording changes and your skill level changes with time. Going back to older pieces and comparing them to current/recent pieces is very good for your confidence as a writer. \n\nThe content of those works doesn't matter. What you wrote as a tween/teen would of course be a little cringe to you now as an adult. You changed as a person. Teens/tweens are generally cringe. Of course their writing would be. Writing is often a reflection of the person that's why each person has a \"signature voice\" when they write. \n\nYour \"friend\" should not be your friend. She needs to learn to respect people's privacy. She lacks basic human relation skills and it shows heavily. You have every right to be angry and kick her out.

That's disgusting behavior. \n\nNTA \n\nI hope this doesn't slow down your writing and cause you to lose confidence. Everyone has pieces of their art they don't want people to see. Everyone has things that aren't the greatest/are embarrassing/and/or are very PRIVATE. Don't let her nasty behavior make you lose confidence. You write. You're a writer. Don't let her make you hesitate next time you sit down to type. No one should be reading what's in your mind until YOU ask them to. She invaded your privacy. \n\nKeep going. Keep writing.
