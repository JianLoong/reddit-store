A sounds like a jerk. Especially for making fun of it\n\nEdit: Also wanted to add that I also keep mine to see how much I\u2019ve improved as well. It\u2019s come in handy because while some of my past stuff might be considered \u201ccringe\u201d it\u2019s made me a better writer because I can see the mistakes I used to make and learn from them, and see how much the characters have developed over the years.", "NTA.

I don't think I would ask her over anymore after this. This was mad disrespectful of her. Hobbies are not cringe and people that ridicule you for the things you love are not good friends.", "NTA but your friend sure is! She shouldn't have been snooping around your documents in the first place, but then it became 100 x worse when she criticised your writing and attempted to delete some of it. Even the best writers probably have cringeworthy first drafts on their computer, which, through revision, they later turn into well-crafted pieces of writing.", "NTA. She is, though, for trying to get rid of something that is yours. She is projecting when she called you immature. Find better friends.", "Excuse me???\n\nShe made fun of your artwork and then tried to delete it?? \n\nIn your own home, on your own computer, as your guest?! \n\nThe attempt would be egregious even if you hadn\u2019t gone on to publish your own work in more official capacities - as it is, talk about insult to injury. I can only imagine her jealousy that you stuck with a hobby and craft long enough to gain successes to your name. \n\nAbsolutely NTA\n\nShe\u2019s lost guest and friend privileges. If she doesn\u2019t apologize for her words and behavior - well, that about says it all.\n\nWith friends like these, who needs internet trolls?", "She should find a hobby and you should find a new friend.

A couple jokes,  sure,  then move on. But trying to delete them?  Nah, calling her out was the right thing to do.", "NTA.\n\nYou stuck up for yourself. A sounds like an immature idiot. Deleting other people's files with sentimental value? Mocking a friend's attempt at something artistic? Your friend is a cringelord.", "NTA.  Mocking someone\u2019s writing/art is hurtful and just not a nice thing for a friend to do in the first place but to go so far as to attempt to delete them?  Yeah, that\u2019s not a friend at all.", "Fun fact: \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d started as a fan fiction piece re \u201cTwilight.\u201d That lady made millions.

Your reaction was appropriately harsh for someone who actually tried to delete your documents without permission.

Do to HER what she tried to do to your files. Delete her from your life because she\u2019s toxic! Good news: you DO have the password so you\u2019ll have no trouble completing the deletion process, Lol.\n\nAs to your desire to hang on to your old writings, this is perfectly normal for artists of all genres and mediums.

Hell, I seek out new ones every few months.  There's nothing wrong with that.  NTA.  I wouldn't even let her in the house after what she tried to do.  I'd block her.  Huge NTA", "NTA\n\nI wrote some proper lame fanfics as a teen but even now (I'm I my mid 30s) I still look back at them lol sad I know but it's my thing.\n\nAnyway, she had no business looking at all. She invaded your privacy after you were kind enough to let her play on your PC. That's not OK.", "NTA and get rid of the friend. Those attitudes, even if we think we have control over our mental state, can have long lasting, negative impacts.

You are worried about having told her to get a hobby? Oh honey, that is hardly a nuclear reply. But you have a serious problem with this girl. She is extremely jealous of you to the point she would destroy your belongings. People like that are not safe to have around. I know having grown up with a jealous mother how far a jealous woman will go to hurt those she is jealous of. Destruction of property, reputation, job, education, false gossip, everything.", "NTA.

Yes.\n\nDon't let anyone break your spirit!", "NTA - what right does she have to judge your creative work? everyone needs to start off, and learn, and develop and grow. It's nice to show how far your skills have developed. \nFirst, she mocked you, and then she actively tried to destroy your creative works.

I can understand a friend gently suggesting that maybe something should be made private, but this WAS private. You didn\u2019t have have a full-size fandom ship flag in the front yard. You had a doc on your personal computer, where nostalgia cringe lives.\n\nShe was being a tool.
