We've never spent holidays together, she likes to visit her family out of state, and I really wanted her to finally spend a holiday with us.\n\nMy GF is keto and in recovery from a serious eating disorder (she starved herself and would make herself throw up) and does most of the cooking and I'm ok with that because she's a great cook and always makes tasty dishes and Im happy to make food she'll eat when I cook.\nKeto helps her stay on track with her recovery and I understand that, but don't see why she can't have the occasional cheat day. She tries to be \"healthy\" and tries to avoid preservatives and sugar but sometimes has a dessert with me, but will only eat stuff she's cooked herself because she has to know what the ingredients are. \n\nHowever my family is very traditional and she definitely isn't. My dad, sister and I (mom is dead) have a tradition of eating lasagna on Christmas Eve and on Christmas day, my family is very traditional with the side dishes and desserts, but like to switch it up and do something interesting every year for the main. This year it's going to be pizza. \n\nWe love our traditions (ex. Grandma always brings the same sweet potato casserole with marshmallows) and usually use traditional recipes, and buy pies from the store for dessert.\n\nI have told my GF a lot about our traditions, and she asked if she could bring a few dishes and a dessert, since she can't eat most of the food, but I think she's just being picky (like she says she couldn't eat a green bean casserole from a traditional recipe because it has canned soup in it and she doesn't want to eat anything with too many preservatives).\n\nI said no, she shouldn't bring dishes because my family really likes our meal as is and I feel like it would be rude to bring your own food to someone else's event. She doesn't like store bought pies because they don't taste as good as homemade says they aren't worth the calories which seems nitpicky.\nI said she should just let go a little and enjoy one special meal that's not part of her diet it's not that big a deal.\n\nThen she asked if instead she could just bring her own separate meal and I said no because that seems even more rude.\n\nI told her she should come and eat what she could, and just take some of the dishes she won't eat to not offend my family, but she said she couldn't do that because it might be \"triggering\" for her to even have that food on her plate.\n\nAt that point I just straight up uninvited her, because everything she suggested seemed rude, and like she was being difficult, and this would be the first time she's meeting my extended family and it would make a bad impression. \n\nShe got upset and really hurt, and I think she's just overreacting, but her BFF, \"Joe\" who is also a friend of mine, said I was being harsh and didn't understand how much she might be struggling from her ED.\n\nAITA for uninviting her and telling her she would offend my family and make a bad impression? \n\n(No, I did not ask my family about her bringing food, they usually don't ask anyone to bring extra stuff for the meal so I assumed they wouldn't like it if she did)", "created_utc": 1668989130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0jqtb/aita_for_uninviting_my_girlfriend_to_christmas/", "score": 1384, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you want to make her feel like shit about her eating habits? You sound awful.", "YTA it's amazing that you even have to ask. How can you say she's keto and recovering from an ED then say you think she's picky? You say this year you're having pizza, regular pizza isn't keto. You knew her diet and knew your family's plans/traditions why did you even invite her in the first place?", "YTA. And in all seriousness I think your GF may have actually posted here a couple of days ago about how much she wants to go and have a good time, but wondered if bringing dishes would be rude.

Why couldn't you have at least asked your family if she could bring a couple common sides, and maybe a dessert? It sounds like you weren't willing to work with her at all, and for that YTA.", "Info: why do you hate your girlfriend and want to make her eating disorder worse?", "Dude, she has had an ED and explicitly told you that she may be triggered to have certain foods on her plate.

I am consistently amazed at how people will espouse about how important family is at the holidays, and at the same time treat people they love so badly. Your GF has a serious illness that puts her health at risk. This will never not be the case. If you cannot get onboard with her illness being a lifelong issue, do her a favor and breakup with her now. \nYou should bear in mind that you must have very little faith in your family\u2019s compassion. I hope you aren\u2019t right.", "Yikes YTA. an eating disorder is not the same thing as *being picky*\n\nYou didn't ask your family, you assumed they wouldn't be understanding of her *legitimate* request\n\nShe offered a solution that would make her feel comfortable and also allowed her to partake in the event and meet all of your family, and you turned it down because \"it's rude\" (assumption)\n\nYou know her ED is serious, but you're not treating it seriously", "Wow YTA.

She\u2019s not asking you or anyone to eat it YTA YTA", "First of all- you may think you understand her eating disorder, but based off your thoughts here it\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t. Eating disorders are mental illnesses-she\u2019s not overreacting. Recovery from an eating disorder is a very delicate process. \n\nAlso - people bring their own food to events all the time. There are plenty of different food restrictions that result in someone needing to bring their own food. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s demanding that your family change the entire menu and only cook what she likes. \n\nWhat is the problem with her bringing extra dishes that the family can partake in as well?? That\u2019s like the exact opposite of rude. That\u2019s very much normal.

I can\u2019t believe you even wrote this asking if you were. Your gf is recovering from a serious illness. It is a lifelong journey for her and if she doesn\u2019t have the compassionate and INFORMED people around her that she needs, it can be dangerous for her. \n\nYou didn\u2019t even attempt to ask your family. If you\u2019re not asking, you\u2019re assuming and that\u2019s being wilfully callous. in this situation. They literally didn\u2019t have to change anything because your gf was prepared to do her own food and STILL attempt to enjoy being around you and your family.\n\nDo her a favour and break up with her so she can leave a man she loves for one she actually deserves.", "Yep, YTA.\n\nYou placed your family food traditions over your girlfriend\u2019s health and recovery. She offered some really reasonable compromises and you should have accepted one of them.", "YTA.\n\nYour girlfriend has an ED. She is still in active recovery. There are no cheat days to recovery. The fact that you treat her treatment of her ED like an arbitrary diet fad shows immense ignorance.\n\nBut even if this was a dieting fad, which it absolutely is not but let\u2019s pretend that it was, that would still be a valid reason to contribute to Thanksgiving.\n\nYou are/were bringing a partner home for the holidays. That usually means you are thinking long term. And traditions/holidays evolve with the family.\n\nIf your girlfriend is on her way to becoming family then traditions should include her. You don\u2019t have to change everything but she should be part of the conversation. You should *want* things to change as your life changes.\n\nBut the fact that you didn\u2019t even consider trying to include her, that you didn\u2019t even talk to your anyone else, tells me you aren\u2019t ready for a serious relationship. \n\nWhile it\u2019s hard and bittersweet to change traditions as family\u2019s members are lost and gained if nothing changes then nothing changes.\n\nYour Thanksgiving will now be exactly the same as it always was while you attend the exact way you always have: without a partner to share it with.\n\nEnjoy your lasagna.", "What's your end game here - expecting her to always just deal with whatever food your family serves, with zero regard for her own health and preferences? She gave you plenty of options for compromise that were very reasonable and a way to allow for tradition to adapt as the family changes. Instead you uninvited her. YTA to the moon and back.", "YTA. \n\nIn the interest of being helpful, I think **it is more apt to compare an ED to addiction than to a diet.**\n\nI, quite literally, would get a (very short term) high when I would make myself sick, and shake / sweat / panic / crave when I didn't. Doctors will tell you this is not uncommon. Science supports that bulimia lights up some of the same parts of the brain as getting high. \n\nThat struggle is compounded by (a) lack of understanding about EDs (as you yourself are demonstrating)  and (b) that one has to eat to live. There's no escaping the drug of choice - only managing it. \n\nThis makes family holidays absolutely hellacious. \n\nYour GF is trying her very best to integrate the reality of her recovery with the reality of her love for you and holidays and your family. Her proposal is not in conflict to that love: it is her best attempt to acknowledge both. \n\nPlease be on her side. YTA.", "Say goodbye to GF, OP because you have shown yourself to be the AH you are.  Hopefully she finds someone more accepting of her.\n\nIf you didn't get it before, YTA.", "YTA your girlfriend is recovering from a serious eating disorder. Bringing her own food is fine. Every single big holiday meal I\u2019ve ever been to people have brought their own food. \n\nIf your family would be offended at her bringing her own food then your family are rude. You\u2019re having fucking pizza on Christmas and somehow you\u2019ve convinced yourself she can\u2019t bring other food because it\u2019s not traditional. Get over yourself.\n\nShe has dietary requirements and she\u2019s explicitly told you not bringing her own food would be triggering for her. Why is that not what you\u2019re most concerned by? You should be helping to plan a way for her to come to your family dinner without potentially relapsing, instead it\u2019s like you\u2019re daring her to spiral.", "YTA. Your lack of compassion and care for her is appalling. Hopefully, she will wise up and uninvite you from her life. As her partner, you should be there to protect her.

Educate yourself, then apologize.", "YTA she\u2019s recovering from an ED. Do you have ANY idea how hard even talking about food probably is for her?

Your GFs request to bring food that she knows that she can and will eat is extremely important.  Apparently, none of this has registered with you.

Your GF is \u201cin recovery\u201d (and from how you\u2019ve described how she eats it sounds that she still has a very unhealthy relationship with food and body image/self-conscience).

Y'know what I did after? I threw it all up when I got home (took more time since it wasn't right after) and spiraled where I dropped 18 more pounds in 2 months before trying to recover again.

Your GF (I hope she has the good sense to make you an EX) has serious heath issues and needs to be mindful of what she eats. You are rude. First you give an invite, then put unrealistic stipulations on it, then rescind the invite when those ridiculous stipulations couldn\u2019t be met! That\u2019s wildly inconsiderate!

I don\u2019t know the timeline of her ED, and everyone\u2019s recovery is different but that\u2019s not something you should push on her, she needs to eventually try on her own or with the help of a licensed therapist and dietician.", "YTA\nNo comment..\ud83d\ude10", "YTA.

She didnt yell or tell him off directly but she kept offering it to him and even put some on his plate anyway when he said no a second time (he doesnt really like it but usually just took some for her sake but decided not to that time), and insisted he have just a little bit since it was an old family recipe and made a comment at one point in the vein of \"your too full for my casserole but your eating all that pie?\"\n\nI suppose I should have asked but was just intimidated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We've never spent holidays together, she likes to visit her family out of state, and I really wanted her to finally spend a holiday with us.\n\nMy GF is keto and in recovery from a serious eating disorder (she started herself and would make herself throw up) and does most of the cooking and I'm ok with that because she's a great cook and always makes tasty dishes and Im happy to make food she'll eat when I cook.\nKeto helps her stay on track with her recovery and I understand that. She tries to be \"healthy\" and tries to avoid preservatives and sugar but sometimes has a dessert with me, but will only eat stuff she's cooked herself because she has to know what the ingredients are. \n\nHowever my family is very traditional and she definitely isn't. My dad, sister and I (mom is dead) have a tradition of eating lasagna on Christmas Eve and on Christmas day, my family is very traditional with the side dishes and desserts, but like to switch it up and do something interesting every year for the main. This year it's going to be pizza. \n\nWe love our traditions (ex. Grandma always brings the same sweet potato casserole with marshmallows) and usually use traditional recipes, and buy pies from the store for dessert.\n\nI have told my GF a lot about our traditions, and she asked if she could bring a few dishes and a dessert, since she can't eat most of the food, but I think she's just being picky (like she says she couldn't eat a green bean casserole from a traditional recipe because it has canned soup in it and she doesn't want to eat anything with too many preservatives).\n\nI said no, she shouldn't bring dishes because my family really likes our meal as is and I feel like it would be rude to bring your own food to someone else's event. She doesn't like store bought pies because they don't taste as good as homemade says they aren't worth the calories which seems nitpicky.\n\nThen she asked if instead she could just bring her own separate meal and I said no because that seems even more rude.\n\nI told her she should come and eat what she could, and just take some of the dishes she won't eat to not offend my family, but she said she couldn't do that because it might be \"triggering\" for her to even have that food on her plate.\n\nAt that point I just straight up uninvited her, because everything she suggested seemed rude, and like she was being difficult, and this would be the first time she's being my extended family and it would make a bad impression. \n\nShe got upset and really hurt, and I think she's just overreacting, but her BFF, \"Joe\" who is also a friend of mine, said I was being harsh and didn't understand how much she might be struggling from her ED.\n\nAITA for uninviting her and telling her she would offend my family and make a bad impression? \n\n(No, I did not ask my family about her bringing food, they usually don't ask anyone to bring extra stuff for the meal so I assumed they wouldn't like it if she did)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You already stated why you're in the wrong. She's not picky, she went through a disorder that highly affected how she viewed herself, her body, and her food. She should not have to take a \"cheat\" day, just because you see it like she's being picky.\n\nI can't believe how many inconsiderate people I keep finding on this subreddit. If she offered to bring her own food, she's not inconveniencing anyone nor forcing anyone to make anything special for her. She would've already made it for herself so she could still be at the table with family and I don't understand why you can't just settle with this knowing your wife's past issues? They may seem like they're in the past, but buddy; those mental scars that disorder had on your wife will never fully heal. And if she has a way of coping with it that keeps her from falling back into that deep pit, shouldn't you be happy that you have such a grown, mature woman for a wife that knows what keeps her healthy and happy and able to be the woman you know now? You don't know what one \"cheat\" day could do to her mental health, and it's probably taken her a long, grueling amount of time to get to where she is today. Why would you want to ruin that for her for the sake of a family tradition dinner?\n\nI thought the main premise of Thanksgiving was to spend time at the dinner table with your family and friends and be thankful for one another despite all of your differences. Why does it have to be such a big deal for you?\n\nApologize to her, let her take the meal. Stand up for her and be a proper spouse if your family has anything to say. You don't have to spread her personal business if she doesn't want it to be spread, but most people should be understanding if you explain that she can't eat the same thing as everyone else for medical or dietary reasons. If they're not understanding, they don't sound like the right people to be spending this special holiday with in that case. She's not being an inconvenience, and you should be making your wife feel as comfortable and welcomed as possible to holidays with family. Have some respect, op.\n\nEdit: Correction: not wife, girlfriend. She's your girlfriend and you're trying to tell her not to eat foods that keep her in a safe mental space. Be proud that she's a grown adult and step off her damn lawn because it's not your business to tell her what to eat. If you're going to marry her you're going to want to apologize and fix this mindset you have about EDs and actually educate yourself on the situation she's in and what she may go through if she's does in fact have that food on her plate.\n\nThat girl will never marry you if you complicate her ed and ruin her road to recovery, end of discussion.", "Yta.

That\u2019s a pretty crappy thing to say about someone who is following a diet you acknowledge helps her stay in recovery. You knew that she followed a strict diet and why, you also know your family traditions for the holidays. Why did you even invite her knowing both of those things and then tell her she can\u2019t bring a few dishes she would be able to eat, again, knowing there were things your family made that she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat.

Okay fine just don\u2019t come then cause you\u2019re making this about you.\u201d I\u2019ve struggled with an earring disorder and I\u2019m being very honest when I say I would leave my partner if he did this.

I would still say that YTA if this was a non holiday dinner, but holiday dinners ( Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter), can be ESPECIALLY triggering for someone who has struggled with ED. \n\nShe is so strong for recognizing potential triggers and trying to be PROACTIVE with herself as to stay with her wellness and treatment plan.

I've never understood what's rude about bringing food to a party when you know can't eat what's provided.\n\nSeriously, why are there so many AITA posts over bringing food to a dinner?

No respect for her at all, mentally you're closer to 10 years of you don't see that what you said and did is a problem. I feel this has to be a fake post because nobody can be this stupid. \"Recovered from a serious eating disorder\", would you tell a recovering alcoholic to join a party where all is served is alcohol?\n\nClearly you are the one offended she wont participate in your traditions, and you worry more about you looking bad than her, you are the offended party here. You also just assume your family won't like her because she brings her own food, without asking them and informing them that she has a serious eating disorder, yes, you are the diplomat of family food traditions.", "YTA\n\n\"Here are all the very understandable reasons why my GF has a hard time with food, but also I think she's just being unreasonable and potentially rude.\"\n\nWtf are you on about?", "YTA!\n\nGood grief, you\u2019re insufferable.", "YTA", "YTA. \nBeyond what others have already said regarding your GF and her recovery from her ED this is a woman you are preparing to propose to (info added in a comment by OP). \nIf you intend to make this woman your family then you need to be willing to be be flexible and open to making new traditions that include her. \nIf you want this woman to become your family then you need to take steps to be inclusive of your GF when you invite her to family events. Perhaps if this year pizza is the chosen main then perhaps your GF can create a keto version of pizza to bring along and share if anyone would like to try it. \nBut really I\u2019m sure that when your family learn how serious you are about your GF, and the reason why she is particular about her food then they won\u2019t have any problem with her bringing foods to contribute on the day.", "YTA - hopefully she uninvites you from her life.

Wow.  You trampled over the whole family and togetherness aspect of the holidays because... she won't eat a pizza on Thanksgiving.  It's a weird hill to die on, but ok.\n\nShe even offered a compromise that wouldn't impede or inconvenience anyone else.  The one being difficult is you.  And to be honest, if you're being this petulant about her first meeting because you're afraid of what they might think of her because of something small like this, your family is a bunch of AHoles too, but we don't know that because you didn't even ask them!!!!", "Yta, let her eat what she wants to eat", "YTA \n\nSo you and your family switch up meals every year as a tradition but your girlfriend bringing her own food is somehow a problem? That makes zero sense. \n\nAlso how inconsiderate you are to know she has an ED but still telling her to put up with it simply for the sake of meeting your family? Well if you and your family are so sensitive that allowing her to eat what won\u2019t harm her recovery is such a big issue that you had to uninvite her, well I\u2019d say she should just leave you. Meeting new people is not worth risking her recovery, and the fact that you think it is? That\u2019s unacceptable and shows you\u2019re unsupportive of her health.

In most places it\u2019s considered respect to being a dish or gift of some sort to thank the hosts. And in no way would I ever feel offended that someone brought something especially if they could not eat what was provided. In fact I\u2019d feel offended if they didn\u2019t inform of their situation so that I could do my best to provide them with food they COULD eat, and if you were my kid, I\u2019d be tearing you a new one for not telling me as the host that your partner had dietary restrictions and being so rude and disrespectful to them that you\u2019d uninvite them for having nothing to eat. \n\nAnd the absolute audacity you have for accusing her of being picky when you know she\u2019s in recovery.", "Ah, the holiday troll is on a roll these days.", "YTA.
