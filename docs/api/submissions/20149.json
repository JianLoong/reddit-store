{"id": 20149, "submission_id": "14ecvvb", "title": "AITA for forcing my tenants out of the house I own when their lease expired?", "selftext": "Using a throwaway.\n\nI (46F) own a second property aside from my own house. I was given this second home as an inheritance after my grandparents passed around 10 years ago and it\u2019s a modest 3 bedroom town house in my city. When it was passed down to me, my husband (51M) and I decided that we would rent it out and keep it until our son (17M) goes off to college, then sell it to be able to pay for his college tuition when the time comes.\n\nAbout 7 years ago, a younger couple moved in and they have 4 kids with another on the way now. Since the mortgage was already paid off when I received the property, my husband and I decided to charge them fairly below market rent in our area ($2000/month is the current lease) because we understood the position of the family and were already benefiting from our equity anyway. Before they even moved in, we made it very clear that we had the intention of selling this property in 2023 when our son was going off to college and have continuously reminded them over the years.\n\nThey agreed and said they understand the circumstances and we had no issues until their final lease was up in April 2023 and they basically refused to move out. I\u2019ve gone over and spoke to them multiple times and the wife is basically saying I\u2019m trying to take \u201ctheir home\u201d away from them especially when she is heavily pregnant. I\u2019ve even tried to offer that they can buy the property off of us at a small discounted rate than what we would list it for, but they just refused any other outcome. She\u2019s a SAHM and from what I\u2019ve been told, her husband works but doesn\u2019t make enough to pay a higher rent which is why we started charging below market rent for 7 whole years.\n\nThey\u2019re essentially squatters in the property now and I\u2019ve recently had the help of my real estate agent, lawyers, and local police department to have them removed from the property because there is a sale pending with a potential buyer. Now the wife is absolutely bashing me around the community and on Facebook about how I \u201ckicked them out\u201d even though their lease was up two months ago. I know legally I am completely in the right, but I\u2019ve had multiple people reach out and say that I should have more sympathy for them and not be greedy. My husband and I think we\u2019ve been sympathetic and given them discounted rent, but it was always clear to them that the house would be sold as it is our only way to send our kids to college with out any student loans.

Keep the place, rent it out at market rate and use that to pay your kid's tuition. You may need to take a loan out for the first semester, but the income from the property should be enough to pay off that loan before interest gets out of hand while also paying each semester going forward without loans/very minimal loans. Even if he took out loans all 4 years, 2k a month in rental income would be enough to pay them off each month after he graduates. Then when he graduates you can talk to a lawyer about the best way (ie least amount of taxes) to transfer the house to your son.* \n\nAs for the matter with the tenants - \n\nNTA - You have told them from day 1 that you would be selling at this time. They had YEARS to plan/save/prepare. They chose not to. I get it, life happens and I am sure that COVID happening in the midst of their tenancy didn't help - but you have already been generous. \n\nThey have been there for 7 years paying below market rent. Lets say for the sake of argument you were giving them a $500 per month discount over what you could have charged someone else. That means you have essentially given up $42,000 in rental income in the past 7 years to help subsidize their living situation. If your son went to a state school in the state you live that would cover his tuition for all four years and you could have kept the house.
