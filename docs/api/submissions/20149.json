{"id": 20149, "submission_id": "14ecvvb", "title": "AITA for forcing my tenants out of the house I own when their lease expired?", "selftext": "Using a throwaway.\n\nI (46F) own a second property aside from my own house. I was given this second home as an inheritance after my grandparents passed around 10 years ago and it\u2019s a modest 3 bedroom town house in my city. When it was passed down to me, my husband (51M) and I decided that we would rent it out and keep it until our son (17M) goes off to college, then sell it to be able to pay for his college tuition when the time comes.\n\nAbout 7 years ago, a younger couple moved in and they have 4 kids with another on the way now. Since the mortgage was already paid off when I received the property, my husband and I decided to charge them fairly below market rent in our area ($2000/month is the current lease) because we understood the position of the family and were already benefiting from our equity anyway. Before they even moved in, we made it very clear that we had the intention of selling this property in 2023 when our son was going off to college and have continuously reminded them over the years.\n\nThey agreed and said they understand the circumstances and we had no issues until their final lease was up in April 2023 and they basically refused to move out. I\u2019ve gone over and spoke to them multiple times and the wife is basically saying I\u2019m trying to take \u201ctheir home\u201d away from them especially when she is heavily pregnant. I\u2019ve even tried to offer that they can buy the property off of us at a small discounted rate than what we would list it for, but they just refused any other outcome. She\u2019s a SAHM and from what I\u2019ve been told, her husband works but doesn\u2019t make enough to pay a higher rent which is why we started charging below market rent for 7 whole years.\n\nThey\u2019re essentially squatters in the property now and I\u2019ve recently had the help of my real estate agent, lawyers, and local police department to have them removed from the property because there is a sale pending with a potential buyer. Now the wife is absolutely bashing me around the community and on Facebook about how I \u201ckicked them out\u201d even though their lease was up two months ago. I know legally I am completely in the right, but I\u2019ve had multiple people reach out and say that I should have more sympathy for them and not be greedy. My husband and I think we\u2019ve been sympathetic and given them discounted rent, but it was always clear to them that the house would be sold as it is our only way to send our kids to college with out any student loans.

Keep the place, rent it out at market rate and use that to pay your kid's tuition. You may need to take a loan out for the first semester, but the income from the property should be enough to pay off that loan before interest gets out of hand while also paying each semester going forward without loans/very minimal loans. Even if he took out loans all 4 years, 2k a month in rental income would be enough to pay them off each month after he graduates. Then when he graduates you can talk to a lawyer about the best way (ie least amount of taxes) to transfer the house to your son.* \n\nAs for the matter with the tenants - \n\nNTA - You have told them from day 1 that you would be selling at this time.

I get it, life happens and I am sure that COVID happening in the midst of their tenancy didn't help - but you have already been generous. \n\nThey have been there for 7 years paying below market rent. Lets say for the sake of argument you were giving them a $500 per month discount over what you could have charged someone else. That means you have essentially given up $42,000 in rental income in the past 7 years to help subsidize their living situation. If your son went to a state school in the state you live that would cover his tuition for all four years and you could have kept the house.

When May-June rolled around, they continued to refuse to leave and became squatters to protest the sale of our property since they cannot find anywhere else they can afford for a family of 6", "As long as they were given correct notice they can be evicted at the end of their lease in lots of places. They were aware the property was being sold and should have made plans. Sales aren\u2019t generally quick things", "Pretty sure once a lease is up a landlord can give a 30 day notice to the tenant that they no longer are renting the place.  Leases don\u2019t just become automatic month to month into perpetuity just because the lessee wants to keep renting it. Not sure if that law varies but I was on a month to month lease after the initial term and the landlord gave me 30 days to vacate and I had to vacate.  Was completely legal.", "The tenants were told repeatedly that the house would go one sale in 2023. The lease was ip and they had been told it would not be renewed. The house was sold, they needed to go.", ">I don't know of anywhere where it's legal to evict someone solely because their lease has ended.\n\nSo are you saying when someone rents a property, the property owner loses all rights to said property until the renter voluntarily leaves? Do you understand how ridiculous that sounds?\n\nThe OP (property owner) let them rent at below market price, was completely up front about plans to sell on certain date, gave them frequent reminders, and ample notice to move out. What more is the owner supposed to do? \n\nThe renters are squatters, acting entitled, and they are the AHs. \n\nOP is NTA.", "I think you're not grasping what month to month tenancy is.  Not sure where you are located, but without a lease, it reverted to month to month, where either the owner or tenant can end the contract with proper notice, and the tenant moves out, without having  contract breach.     It's not an  \"illegal eviction \" if they were given notice, which they were, based on the post.  Just because they don't want to leave doesn't mean they don't legally have to.    \nAnd, asshole blame notwithstanding, they are now squatters. \n\nYou can't legally occupy someone's property without a lease and without their permission.  \n\nHowever if op is still accepting their rent payment, depending on their jurisdiction,  it may be tacit approval of the month to month, but I am NAL and they should probably consult one if they haven't done so.", "Idk where OP lives but at least in Virginia if you give 60 days notice of intent NOT to renew, then it\u2019s fully legal and renters have to leave. The real question is whether or not they gave WRITTEN notice to the tenants. \n\nAnyway NTA", "FYI, lots of states allow landlords to evict holdover tenants\u2014as long as the landlord provides adequate notice\u2014including California, Illinois, and New York. In fact, without checking, I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s the case in most jurisdictions.", "Where do you live that its illegal to not renew a lease? Its a contract and if either party doesn't want to renew the contract they aren't legally required to do so.", "I've lived places where this would be illegal and places where it would be legal. Legalities aside, I'm on the side that the practice is unethical regardless of legality. What you have or haven't done for them (lower rent than you could have charged) is irrelevant. People are going to disagree with me but ESH (ESH includes the policy makers)", "Fair enough.", "It\u2019s YOUR home, not theirs! I used to rent a home in PA, in 2000 received a certified letter that the house was being sold and I had 30 days to get out. I moved out! It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s not my house to take over \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "There\u2019s some nuance to this\u2014and it depends on the state\u2014but this is basically accurate. \n\nLandlords can evict holdover tenants, but have to give (usually) one month\u2019s notice. It\u2019s basically the same as informing a tenant in a month-to-month tenancy that you intend to terminate the ~~lease~~ tenancy.", "Eh, this completely depends where you live. Some places fixed contracts are the norm and plenty places automatically resume to monthly. Hell, in some places this contract would be illegal on several levels. I'm assuming it's legal wherever they live considering the lawyers but I hate such practices and think they're inherently unethical but a lot of people want them for whatever reasons.", "I\u2019m honestly so confused by this take lmao no matter someone\u2019s opinion on landlords this just makes no sense \ud83e\udd23", "That is legitimately how it works in some rental markets, yes.", "Some places in Canada, places that are rent control, etc. make it is that leases can only be non renewed for direct violations", "So, not renewing a lease doesn\u2019t automatically mean the tenancy is over/eviction: this becomes a month-to-month tenancy, usually at the same rate. Depending on the state, either party can end the tenancy at this point, but have to give one month\u2019s notice (usually). \n\nStill, every state I know of allows landlords to evict holdover tenants.", "That is interesting. We don't have those kinds of protections in my state but it makes a lot of sense when you are talking about rent-control."]}
