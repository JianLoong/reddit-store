After I get out of my car, he starts asking if I have a dog in my car, which is obvious I do because you can clearly see her through the window.\n\nI tell him, yes, I do. I immediately have an uneasy feeling about him, get my dog out, and start walking quickly into the park. But the guy starts following me. He\u2019s telling me he doesn\u2019t see any other dogs in there, then he tells me his name. \n\nI ignore him, hurry to the park, and as soon as I get her off leash, he starts unlatching the gate. I ask him why he\u2019s coming inside if he doesn\u2019t have a dog. He says he is just coming to hang out in there and smoke a cigarette, to which I reply I\u2019m not comfortable with him doing that. But he continues inside anyway, even though I repeated much louder I am not comfortable with him coming inside there with me.\n\nHe shrugs off whah I say and walks over to and sits directly on the bench. So I leash my dog back up and immediately take her into the smaller area, to which he tells me I don\u2019t need to leave. I tell him again, that I was not comfortable with him being in there with me, and that his behavior was very inappropriate and downright predatory since he followed a woman into a dog park while she was alone. The entire time this was going on, my dog was growling lightly and she refused to leave my side rather than go run and play like usual. \n\nHe finally left, but not before calling me an AH because he claims all he wanted to do was hang out in the park and smoke a cigarette. So am I the asshole?\n\nETA: there was nobody else in the dog park, which was why he made his comment he didn\u2019t see any dogs in there. It was just me, my dog, and that guy following us.", "created_utc": 1685325550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uhr89/aita_for_telling_a_guy_his_behavior_was_creepy/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think the other commenter I see realizes that you were in a dog park and he had no dog. That's beyond creepy. That's light stalking at that point. Also, who smokes in a dog park. Generally speaking, that isn't allowed.", "From my favorite true crime podcasters (Crime Junkie): \u201cBe weird. Be rude. Stay alive.\u201d\n\nAlso he was being creepy. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he was doing. If he just wanted to hang out and smoke, he'd have walked in, smoked, and said \"nice dog ma'am. She's very pretty.\" The things a normal person does. He's just doing all manner of bad vibes stuff.", "NTA!!!! Your gut told you immediately something was wrong because it was. I\u2019m proud of you for clearly and loudly standing up for yourself. If I were nearby and heard you, I\u2019d come over and pretend like I knew you to make creepy man leave. He was mad bc you didn\u2019t allow him to make you a victim. NTA a thousand times over.", "NTA, trust your gut instincts in a situation like this, there are plenty of other places to smoke and hang out in a park.", "NTA\n\nHe could have smoked anywhere in the park. ANYWHERE. He chose to do so near you, after approaching you at your car and knowing you don\u2019t want to engage. Creepy McCreeperFace can throw his pity party somewhere else.", "NTA\n\nWere there other people at the dog park? The way you wrote your post gives the impression that it was just you your dog and the creepy guy.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a similar situation in the future, just leave. Trust your intuition.", "Let\u2019s recap. He:\n\n- changed directions to follow you\n- went into the dog park even tho he had no dog \n- questioned you when you left \n- got offended when you told him you weren\u2019t comfortable \n- made your dog uncomfortable \n\nNope. NTA. This kind of behavior is never okay.", "NTA trust your gut! I\u2019ve had similar experiences and they always turn out to be a predator. Stay safe out there", "You're NTA. He was being creepy. Who the heck goes to a dog park *without a dog* to smoke a cigarette? The same person who follows a lone woman around after he's already realized no one else is around, and then gets all huffy when she doesn't like it- a predator. \n\nA harmless guy would have backed off and left as soon as you said you were uncomfortable. Not just to ease your discomfort, but to protect himself from allegations of misconduct.", "NTA, you did the right thing by going with your gut instinct. Sometimes when someone seems off, they really are", "NTA, can\u2019t stand clueless guys who try to hit on you and get pissy when they are rightfully called out as creepy", "NTA, he was clearly being a creep for no reason", "NTA. He was very creepy but he has a right to be at a public park. I also can't call you out for being concerned for your own safety.\n\nEDIT: Thinking about it more, he's definitely an AH for changing directions and making you feel uncomfortable like that.", "Nta parks are large enough that he can hangout somewhere that isn't right next to you. If there is a next time try telling him that you have asthma and can't be around cigarette smoke then magically get a silent text that you need to call someone in response to.", "NTA! Women get hurt by worrying about hurting men's feelings! Good guys don't get their feelings hurt when they're told to back off! Good for you!!", "NTA - assume, for a moment that he inadvertently creeped you out through being clueless. A decent man in that situation would apologise and back off immediately,not whine that he only wanted to smoke a cigarette in a deserted dog park. \n\nHe was a creep and women die because we\u2019ve been conditioned to be polite even when our spidey senses are tingling and we\u2019re confronted by creeps. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Besides, your dog was picking up on something. Always trust your gut, but more importantly, always trust your dog.", "NTA.  You are within your rights to tell him.  That said, you were in a public space so distance more than covid space probably won't get you anywhere unless you are in a very liberal jurisdiction.", "NTA. Maybe next time just get back into the car and leave. \n\nIt sucks to have your plans ruined but your life is worth it.", "NTA, even if he wasn\u2019t intentionally being a creep, guys don\u2019t seem to realize how terrifying it is to be a woman and have a random man follow you. I have a heart attack every time a man comes up behind me, even though it always turns out to be nothing. it\u2019s like they have no awareness", "NTA. However, it is a public park, so you obviously could not prevent him from entering without a dog. Although, that is creep AF and I'm glad you're safe.", "NTA especially when you told him he's making you uncomfortable and he kept continuing this way.", "NTA always follow your gut instinct.", "NTA, please report this to the local police, you most likely are not the only woman he approached or will approach.  Please next time you get approached like this get back in the car and drive off.  Your dog would be more disappointed if something happened to you verses missing a day of off leash time.", "\u201cFUCK POLITENESS\u201d This is the best life lesson I\u2019ve ever heard on a true crime podcast. \n\nNTA", "NTA I really want to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was just a friendly dude looking for some friendly stranger banter while he smoked his cig but the fact that he couldn\u2019t catch the social cues made him a creep. Good on you for holding your own OP. Guys like that make my skin crawl.", "Nta but I really don't understand why you continued to the park if he approached at your vehicle.
