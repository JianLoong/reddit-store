She said she had food cut and ready to be air fried but couldn't do it. She was pissed when I got back and said that I can't just take appliances. I told her that it is my appliance and I can do as I please.

To the point where I saved money and was able to just do fun things with that extra money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd stuff like this has happened before. She's taken her blender places and our other roommate took her coffee machine when she was staying somewhere else. I don't see why this is my problem.

You each have something in the kitchen that is used by others at times and you all take the items you personally purchased with you at times.  No biggie.

She's wrong.\n\nShe's not going to see it that way. Start keeping the air fryer in your room when you're at home.
