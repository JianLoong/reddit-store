Because it is mine, if  I am home and someone wants to use it they will ask me first because I might be wanting to make something soon. And it is the same with other people's appliances, we all ask. The only communal item is the oven/stove and microwave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the last year I have been travelling a lot more and to save money on food expenses, I bring the airfryer with me. I also like eating healthy and don't want to eat out often. So with the money work gives me for food expenses. I just buy raw meat and vegetables and store them in a cooler in the car if I am on the road. And when I am lodging somewhere I put them in the fridge. When the time comes I'll just plug in my airfryer and season them up and toss them inside. I also have a small rice cooker and will do that as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy one roommate doesn't really care but this PISSES off my other roommate. The first time it happened she blew up my phone.  She said she had food cut and ready to be air fried but couldn't do it. She was pissed when I got back and said that I can't just take appliances. I told her that it is my appliance and I can do as I please. I told her and this is where I could be an asshole that \"I wouldn't throw a bitch fit if you took the blender with you.\" She said that she uses the airfryer for most of her meals and meal prep. I said \"use the oven or stove when I am gone.\" She said she uses it to reheat her food and that the microwave just isn't as good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think any of this is my problem. If it is REALLY that important to her. I feel like she could just pick up an airfryer herself. I told her this and she said they are too expensive(which they aren't) but I just said it isn't my problem. Recently I was on the road for a whole month and I did a lot of cooking.  To the point where I saved money and was able to just do fun things with that extra money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd stuff like this has happened before. She's taken her blender places and our other roommate took her coffee machine when she was staying somewhere else. I don't see why this is my problem. Maybe I could be partially the asshole for not warning her the first time. But it is mine so I just don't see the point.

You have every right to take YOUR airfryer and use it. She shouldn't plan her entire diet around someone else's stuff and if the airfryer is essential to her life, she buys her own. If I were you, I wouldn't lend it to her when I get back because she feels entitled to use it.", "NTA \"So be the clear. The airfryer is MINE.\" kinda ends all discussion here. Your property, your decision. She can buy a second one if it's that important.", "NTA. It's yours, and you can do what you want with it. Also - an air fryer isn't *that* different from an oven - especially if your oven has a convection setting. Basically the same thing. She can manage for a few days.", "NTA. Air fryer is your property, you can take where you wish. Roommate can buy her own if she needs one that bad.", "NTA. It's your property you can do what you want it. If she needs one around she can buy one herself. Lots of people have 2 anyway.", "NTA\n\nYour personal property, your choice to take it traveling to exotic locations. \n\nAs many others have mentioned, if the roommate is so dependent upon the appliance, she probably would be well served to invest in her own.", "NTA.... Your roommate acts like the prepared food was wasted... Have they ever heard of a skillet or oven? Both useful in preparing food, I hear.", "NTA. I would want to kick the roommate out or find a new place to live.", "NTA. Tell her again to buy her own. She\u2019s being ridiculously childish", "Nta", "NTA, so she takes her blender with her?  The other roommate takes her coffee machine. But you must leave your air fryer for her convenience?  Hypocrite and entitled, she can buy her own.", "A simple fix to this issue would be for you and your 2 roommates to all chip in equally to purchase a community airfryer.  Airfryers have come way down in price so a 3 way split would be minimal.  This way you could keep yours packed and ready to go when you travel and one would always be available in the apartment.

Mostly because air fryers are not expensive and even if they were if she is so reliant on one she should buy one.  \n\nWhat would happen if you moved out?
