NTA.", "Echoing this sentiment. I would not have stuck around longer than 24 hours of this, and yes, gently but firmly insisted upon a refund.

NTA", "> You would also be NTA if you DEMANDED a refund, especially after you were told that this woman wouldn't be around during your vacation.\n\nI may be a bit less assertive, but I would only demand a refund if OP at least once said something to the friend. There might have been assurances at the start that she wouldn't be around, but if everyone just tolerated her showing up and nobody ever said \"Could you please leave us to enjoy our vacation?\" then I think asking for a refund would be a little like eating most of the soup and then asking for a refund because there was a hair in it the entire time.", "Your first paragraph is so true, and unfortunately I\u2019ve been this person.

You paid for a relaxing fun time with your extended family and these are precious moments and she ruined it.

OP is making this so much harder on herself by paying attention", "That's a very real possibility. If that was indeed the case, she should have either declined or insisted that there be no payment. The entire point of renting out a vacation spot is that it is free of the owner for the renters to use. Otherwise she's just hosting, and accepting money for that is just inappropriate. You \"pay\" a host by thanking them, sending a card, bringing a gift, and/or reciprocating the favor by having them over in the future.", "If my group spent $500-$1000+ to stay at a vacation home, I would have a hard expectation that the owner isn't inserting themselves into the vacation and distracting from the group's time. It's not feasible to ignore a person who is monopolizing e.g. dinner conversations with their personal issues, so that strategy of an individual person ignoring them doesn't solve the problem.\n\nFurther, telling your host to shut up is a good way to get the vacation ended early anyway.", "Friend was out of line completely. But this didn't have to be a vacay killer. \n\nOP could have packed a picnic lunch and gone on a hike with husband and a couple others (do a rotation system).

IMO, no.", "Exactly - if you're free to go home, you're free to leave the cottage and spend the whole day until after dinner time OUT OF THE HOUSE and away from the chatterbox.\n\nBut if OP was there to just chill out, lay around in peace and quiet and do zero touring, I can see why they needed to leave.", "INFO\n\nDid you tell the friend that you do not care to talk about her divorce?

Why can't people use their words?", " I'd rather take that $ a have a few relaxing days at some other hotel with my spouse.", "That was my thought. If you rent a cottage, you don't expect the landlord to share it with you. Mom probably didn't tell her daughter because she knew she wouldn't like it.", "I honestly disagree. If she normally rents it on AirBNB or whatever, then it\u2019s a source of income \u2014 which is especially important while dealing with a difficult divorce. She could have rented it to someone else, OP\u2019s family was planning to pay regardless, therefore OP\u2019s family is welcome to invite the property owner as their guest without that freeing them of financial obligation to the property owner.\n\nAlso, for many people, renting a cottage isn\u2019t about the privacy; it\u2019s about the location, and a comfortable place to sleep. Many people pay to stay in rooms in a house where the property owner is present; they don\u2019t usually socialize with the owner all that much, but having a comfortable place to sleep in a nice location, with access to a living area, dining area, and kitchen, is valuable in its own right. The property owner should probably offer a discount, or treat them to meals, but they are being invited as a guest to a paid-for location. They never volunteered to be a host for free. Reimbursing OP\u2019s family would be a loss of thousands of dollars; unless they asked to tag along (in which case a discount would be appropriate), expecting a gift of hundreds or thousands of dollars in exchange for an invitation is unreasonable.", "I'm a big fan of saying, loudly \"chisel!\" & when questioned, respond w \"I just wanted to get a word in edgewise\".", "NTA.

I blame your mom just as much of not more than the friend. Your mom understands the situation entirely, is in the best position to fix it by lovingly but firmly setting boundaries for her friend, yet refused to do so. The friends conduct, while not acceptable, is attributable to a terrible life event and could be just severe obliviousness.", "NTA  You didn't leave your family in the lurch financially.  Either your mother misrepresented the involvement of her friend OR the friend just glommed onto your vacation.  Nothing wrong with leaving as you did.", "NTA \nIf this woman regularly rents this cottage out,  she should most certainly know better than to walk in without knocking,  friend or not. Then to mooch meals as well.  Sheesh!  It sounds like she behaved as if you guys were all there to keep her company as invited guests & not paying ones. \n\nYour Mom sounds too nice to do this,  but I would have tried to say something nicely to her or ask for a partial refund considering her behavior.  Sounds like a horrible vacation.", "NTA. Vacation in a cottage should be peaceful. That sounds more stressful than everyday life. Nothing about this is a vacation.", "NTA\n\n>Hey Mom,  \n>  \n>First, I want you to know I love you. I put up with your friend because I care about you and didn't want you to lose out on a valuable relationship. However, you lied to me about her being on the trip.  \n>  \n>This vacation damaged my trust in you. I thought we were going to have an awesome trip and it got ruined because of your inaction. It's like her comfort was the only thing that mattered, even more than your own family's. I wanted you to ask her to leave the first day, but maybe I should have been more direct with her.  \n>  \n>Her divorce shouldn't have taken over the whole trip. We were there to have a good time, not to be dragged into someone else's issues. You should have been honest with her and asked her to leave. Or to stop talking about the divorce.  \n>  \n>What really bothered me the most? That you were fully aware of how uncomfortable the situation was for us. Yet, you didn't lift a finger to fix it, and things just got worse as the days went on. Your lack of action, your friend-first attitude, it all led to a vacation that was anything but enjoyable for me.  \n>  \n>It will take some time before I will be going on a vacation with you. The next time something like this happens, I will personally ask them to leave and will be very blunt about how I feel.  \n>  \n>That being said, I would like a refund for the trip. It can be for the full amount or minus the three days we were there. But I need money back and I need you to promise me that something like this will never happen again. If I do happen to see your friend again, I will be mentioning to her why I left early, how much she ruined the trip, etc.  \n>  \n>I hope you're willing to own up to this and sort it out.", "NTA.\n\nYour Mom doesn't understand how much Grace you extended putting up with that b.s.", "NTA.    No one should have to do that ESPECIALLY since you were renting the place.", "I will be mentioning to her why I left early, how much she ruined the trip, etc. I hope he's willing to own up to this and sort it out.", " I just spent three days with her and I was almost in tears by the end.", "Do people not just say, \"Hey, you are very nice, but you are overwhelming with how much you are talking?\"", "Except:\n\n> My mom advised that the friend would not be around during the vacation.\n\nIf she turned around and invited the friend without telling people, then it's not the vacation anyone else signed up for, and Mom ought to shoulder the cost of changed plans.", "I agree that mom should pay the difference! I was just saying the property owner may not be the one in the wrong here.", "Even if the property owner was invited as a guest to hang out, you don't turn it into Depression 101."]}
