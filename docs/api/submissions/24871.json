No thanks.\n\nFWIW - I always hate when people do this, and badmouth marriage, when I'm sitting next to my wife whom I love spending my time with.  It just creates this awkward thing where you feel like tehy are saying, \"You're next.\" Or the \"Woe is me, I can't marry someone like your wife/husband.\"  Just awkward.", "NTA - You set boundaries and stuck to them.

You were supposed to be on vacation with *your family*.
