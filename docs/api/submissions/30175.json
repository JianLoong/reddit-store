The costume looked really good on her, as she\u2019s only middle age (49) and works out. She starts talking about how she\u2019s ready to party, as though she hasn\u2019t had any \u201cfun\u201d since her divorce four months ago. I agreed that it would be nice for her to have some fun tonight. Things start moving smoothly; people start showing up to the party, and my cousin seemed genuinely happy about how her party was going. Everyone that attended was in their early 20's, as most were friends she went to school with and are in college with now. I myself am only 23, so this didn\u2019t feel out of place for me. I didn\u2019t expect my aunt to basically get shitfaced and flirt with every boy there. I had to call her name multiple times to get her away from the guys she was being flirty with. Most of them looked uncomfortable but didn\u2019t want to be rude. She wasn\u2019t picking up on social or body cues whatsoever, so I just had to keep chiming in to get her away from them.

Her daughter was clearly embarrassed but didn\u2019t want to confront her mother, so I stepped in to make sure she could enjoy her party. My cousins and I had different views on the matter and told me to let her have fun, but I tried explaining that most of the guys genuinely seemed uncomfortable with her flirting. This is not a movie, and not every young guy wants to sleep with their friend's mother. My aunt continued on flirting the night away, so I ended up pulling her aside to tell her this was not the way to go about getting over her divorce.

OP said an older woman flirting heavy with college *boys*, their comment asked what if it was flipped and was an older man with college *girls*. It wasn't infantilizing anyone, nor was it inflammatory. People very rarely say anything about the use of \"girls\" unless it's being used in context of someone actually doing something that infantilizes or demeans them, which this did not. That's why I said context is important. Saying an older man hit on college girls is not demeaning.
