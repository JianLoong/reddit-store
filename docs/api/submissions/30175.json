When I showed up, it was pretty early, so only a few of my other cousins our age were there at the time. I started helping with my cousin's Halloween makeup (bday girl), and my aunt came into the room (bday girl mom) to show off her Halloween custom, which was a \u201csexy referee,\u201d in her words. The costume looked really good on her, as she\u2019s only middle age (49) and works out. She starts talking about how she\u2019s ready to party, as though she hasn\u2019t had any \u201cfun\u201d since her divorce four months ago. I agreed that it would be nice for her to have some fun tonight. Things start moving smoothly; people start showing up to the party, and my cousin seemed genuinely happy about how her party was going. Everyone that attended was in their early 20's, as most were friends she went to school with and are in college with now. I myself am only 23, so this didn\u2019t feel out of place for me. I didn\u2019t expect my aunt to basically get shitfaced and flirt with every boy there. I had to call her name multiple times to get her away from the guys she was being flirty with. Most of them looked uncomfortable but didn\u2019t want to be rude. She wasn\u2019t picking up on social or body cues whatsoever, so I just had to keep chiming in to get her away from them. She told me she\u2019s finding her a \u201cyoung hottie\u201d that can satisfy her, and I shit you not I threw up in my mouth. Her daughter was clearly embarrassed but didn\u2019t want to confront her mother, so I stepped in to make sure she could enjoy her party. My cousins and I had different views on the matter and told me to let her have fun, but I tried explaining that most of the guys genuinely seemed uncomfortable with her flirting. This is not a movie, and not every young guy wants to sleep with their friend's mother. My aunt continued on flirting the night away, so I ended up pulling her aside to tell her this was not the way to go about getting over her divorce. She was pissed at me and said everyone\u2019s adults were here. My cousins think I'm an asshole for telling her that. Not only was this her daughter\u2019s birthday, but that just seemed inappropriate to me.", "created_utc": 1698944239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m830l/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_this_is_not_the_way_to/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Doesn't matter the reason, hitting on your children's friends is always a bit gross.", "NTA\n\nIt was the wrong time and place for her to behave that way. Also, if I was going through a hard time and began to make a fool of myself in front of my kid and her friends, I would want someone to step in and stop me.

Generally I have no problem with big age gaps in couples once everyone is a true adults (i.e.: past 25 years old, when most people's pre-frontal cortex has reached full development). But given the circumstances, a party planned by young adults for young adults, you aunt was completely out of line and deserved to be called out on it, especially since she was drunk so even if they wanted to no one could \"satisfy\" her since she wasn't in a state to give consent.", "NTA.  It was her daughter's party and not the time for Mom to be the center of attention.  There are bars and pubs for this.", "i\u2019m more interested why the daughter wanted to be around family on her 21st.  no offense, but on my 21st i didn\u2019t want to be anywhere remotely close to my family.", "NTA, you are clearly not judging her for her attire or for wanting to put herself out there.  But hitting up your kid's friends?  Gross at any age, honestly.", "NTA.  \"Stacy's Mom\" is a fun song or an interesting movie plot.  It does not (always) work out that way in real life.  And if one of the young men CHOSE to accept her advances, that's one thing.  But it doesn't sound like that was the vibe and it sounds like you tried to handle things fairly quietly and direct, good choice.", "NTA she should have gone out to a bar or club or another party.

It\u2019s not cute to play these games even in a situation wherein it would be appropriate for her to be mildly flirtatious. But this isn\u2019t the case. She\u2019s twice their age. She\u2019s sexually harassing people. She behaved grossly. I\u2019d have shut my own party down if my mother was behaving that way.

Especially right in front of her daughter and making her lose her dignity. ABSOLUTELY! And I wouldn\u2019t like for my mother to be acting that way either.

YOU chose to presume to speak about the right way to get over a divorce... at 23, when you have no idea about that at all.

Bc thats the way you will piss off your daughter so much, their relationship could seriously suffer. And i agree, losing the good relationship with your daughter is not the way you get over a divorce.

Like you wanna get tf away but you also don\u2019t want to offend a friends mom and sour the friendship, hell maybe one has eyes for the daughter and now all the sudden her mom is in their face, sounds pretty uncomfortable to me", "So if your 50 year old uncle was hitting on 20 something year old women making them uncomfortable.  Would you just mind your own business", "So you be ok if you had a 50 year old uncle hitting on 20 year old women and making them visibly uncomfortable.

As they passed me one of them reached down and grabbed my butt, I basically froze for a moment and then freaked the hell out. They laughed at me and told me that I enjoyed it and to stop making a big fuss about it. I tried reporting it and basically got laughed at it. I do feel that when men are sexually harassed by women it is taken far less seriously than the reverse.

College/work friends that he is meeting for the first time. Fine. \n\n\nI have no problem with dating older people. When I was in my 20s I loved me some MILFs and dated nothing but women that were older than me.", "oh, so as long as someone isn't physically touched it's ok.  i disagree with that but hey we have different values i guess", "And this is why we live in a culture where predators are comfortable practicing sexual abuse and harassment in the open. I'm sure they appreciate you being on their side", "Ok but we\u2019re not talking about dating. We\u2019re talking about flirting. If the guys are uncomfortable VISIBLY and she keeps doing it. Is that okay?", ">and he respected a No", "How do you date without flirting? \n\nI would expect the adults to handle it themselves. I would mind my own business. \n\nWe can keep going back and forth. But my answer will always be. Consenting adults need to work it out themselves. And I will not let anyone be forced into anything in front of me. Other wise I will mind my business and not get involved in other people's drama.", "You know not everytime someone verbally says no right?  \n\nThat's why I didn't include that.  A lot of time people who are uncomfortable won't say no.", "Agree to disagree", "To be fair it\u2019s not flirting if it\u2019s one sided. That\u2019s harassment. \n\nSo technically speaking no dating usually doesn\u2019t start with harassment. I\u2019m sure when you were out with your milfs you both reciprocated feelings. Also please don\u2019t think like. \u201can adult should be able to handle themselves.\u201dBeing sexually harassed can put anyone in a vulnerable state and It also adds fumes to the misandry in the world. Because from your statement men can\u2019t be sexually harassed just flirted with. \n\nOP NTA because at the end of the day you pulled a lot of men out of uncomfortable situations. They might not tell their friend because their friend could be a guy like this commenter above but I\u2019m sure in their head they are thanking you.", "The sub is called \"am I the asshole,\" not \"am I the criminal.\". Yes, it's perfectly legal for her to act this way, but it's still creepy and gross.", "Then there are plenty of ways for me to interject myself into the situation without telling my hypothetical uncle that it's weird that he is hitting on women. \n\nI have no problem with my Uncle I don't have hitting on who ever he wants as long as they are consenting adults. I would expect that adult to handle their own shit. But if I saw my apparently rapey hypothetical uncle forcing himself on someone who looked like they needed saving I would just simply interject myself into their conversation and remove her if she looked like she needed help.", "so you agree you wouldn't just \"mind your business\"  I would just say I would lean more to talking to the creepy older person so they know what their doing is inappropriate.  Especially if they are doing it to multiple people.  As OP stated her aunt was doing.", "So you're saying you'd just babysit pervy Uncle?\n\nAt his daughter's Bday party.", "I would never tell someone it's inappropriate for them to talk to someone else. I would mind my own business on that. \n\nI would not let someone get forced into something they did not want in front of me."]}
