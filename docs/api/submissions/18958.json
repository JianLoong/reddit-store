Your dad is acting really immature, and giving ultimatums like this will likely not stop at this one. He's been good at times, but is ultimately unreliable, whereas your grandmother isn't.

My dad has been sort of estranged from my life for the past few years due to drug and alcohol issues. I don\u2019t really see my mom either. I\u2019ve lived in my grandmas and grandpas house since I was about 6, and for a while my dad lived there too. In 2019, my grandpa passed away due to heart complications and there was a bit of a break in my family because my grandpa really just kept everything together.\n\nAbout two years ago, my grandma met a guy who she got along with and they started traveling across the US since it was something she was never able to do when my grandpa was alive because she had to care for him. My dad seemed to take this extremely personally and didn\u2019t like him at all. At one point, he screamed and tried to start a fight with him, which ultimately caused my grandma to kick my dad out of the house. \n\nAs it stands, my grandma, her boyfriend, my dad, my two aunts, my uncle, and my mom and 3 of my siblings are to attend my graduation this afternoon.

Do not hurt your grandma for him.", "NTA. He is not in a position to make demands and changing profile pictures is incredibly childish. I think you are doing the right thing by making your decisions and leaving it up to him whether to attend or not.", "YWNBTA for not caving into your dad's ridiculous blackmail!\n\nYour dad is invited to your graduation.

Do NOT submit to his abuse.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "NTA If there was ever a hill to die on this would be it. Your father is acting childish and vindictive to you,  a 17 year old, he's been in and out of your life with no stability. Your grandmother has been there for you throughout and her new guy seems to be really good for her. If your father decides to continue his tantrum, let him.", "YWNBTA. \n\nYour dad is trying to bully you into choosing between him and someone else. That's never acceptable.\n\nChanging his profile pic is manipulative, childish, and spiteful.\n\nAnd he sounds like someone who will throw a tantrum at your graduation if someone says something he doesn't like. Honestly, I think it will be more pleasant without him there.", "NTA. Your dad is petty and foolish and clearly hasn't grown much as a person since your childhood. Let him stay home and sulk.", "Tell him you aren't picking between anyone. You're inviting people to your graduation and they can come or not but you aren't changing the guest list because someone is trying to force you to make a choice that you don't need to make. Your dad can choose not to attend, your grandmother can choose to ask her boyfriend not to attend, but the relationship between them isn't yours and this event is about you and the relationship between you and who you invite.\n\nYour dad and grandmother can work it out, if anyone has to.", "NTA. This shit by \"adults\" is infuriating. Dont uninvite anybody- its your day.\n\n If he's too immature to at least act like a grown-ass adult- a DAD- for a few hours then you're better off without him.\n\nCongratulations on your achievement, enjoy your day.", "NTA. And every time a person says \"you must choose between me and X\" it's the sayer who's worth ditching, regardless of the situation. A decent person never will demand this.", "NTA, your dad is being a giant one though. Hes acting childish because his mom doesnt want to be alone. She wanted companionship and found it.", "He is an unreasonable AH. NTA.", "Really though. Cropping her out of his profile picture because of a little spat like this? What kind of petty middle school BS is that? Guy is acting like a disgruntled 12 year old.", "This. YWNBTA \n\nCongrads on your big day !"]}
