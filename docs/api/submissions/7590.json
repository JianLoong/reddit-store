My wife also has a 9 year old daughter from a previous relationship. \n\nMy stepdaughter\u2019s dad isn\u2019t a good guy. He\u2019s been in prison for the past 5 years and both my wife and stepdaughter are in therapy because of him. \n\nMy stepdaughter has always been clingy with my wife. She doesn\u2019t sleep if my wife doesn\u2019t lay down with her until she falls asleep. Sometimes she uses the phone at school to call my wife just because she needs to hear her voice. She also has nightmares and needs my wife to sleep in her bed fairly often. \n\nShe has been even worse since we had the baby. My wife says it\u2019s because her routine is disrupted and she needs time to get used to having another person in the house and all of the changes but this means that she has been sleeping in her daughter\u2019s room at least one night a week for the past two months. \n\nMy wife and I rotate who has to get up with the baby at night. One night it\u2019s her, next is me, then back to her, etc. and it has worked well for us so far. The only problem is, if her daughter wants to sleep with her when it\u2019s her night with the baby, she expects me to take her night. She won\u2019t switch nights with me or try to make it up in any way. She just says her daughter needs her so I need to be with the baby that night. \n\nI talked to her about it and said that if something comes up and she needs me to take her night, she should either be willing to take one of my nights or do more chores around the house to make up for it. She got defensive and refused because she\u2019s not getting a night off, she\u2019s taking care of her traumatized older daughter. I told her I get that but she\u2019s still affecting my sleep by making me do her nights. \n\nLast night was her night. At 8, her daughter said she wanted my wife to sleep in her room. When she said that, I told my wife she\u2019s still going to be with our baby that night then locked myself in the guest room. My wife didn\u2019t speak to me last night or this morning but she texted me a couple hours ago saying she\u2019s taking the kids to her mom\u2019s house. I checked our cameras and she filled her trunk with suitcases and even threw some bags in her front seat. \n\nI\u2019m going to go to her moms house to talk to her after work but I wanted to know if I was the asshole for not taking the baby on her nights.", "created_utc": 1673991923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eojxo/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_baby_on_my_wifes/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree with you that there's a problem but this was not a solution for anyone but you.", "YTA\n\nYou seem to deeply resent an 8 year old.\n\nHere is the deal. Your wife is responsible for caring for 2 children and you are responsible for caring for 1 child. Your wife is trying to make sure both kids are getting what they need.", "YTA. Despite what your language implies, you have two children that need attention. Your wife is correct in saying she's not getting a night off. I highly doubt she's getting great sleep while caring for the older one.\n\nBy all means, have deeper discussions about how your stepdaughter should be handled at night and stand your ground on needing your fair share of sleep. But locking yourself away and forcing her to care for both kids alone (while she's still recovering from giving birth ffs) is AH behavior.", "YTA. You don't play tit for tat over a baby, it's your baby. Not a chore.", "Relationships are not always 50/50, and that's the cold hard truth. Sometimes you have to give a little more than you get, and sometimes you need to get a little more than you give. Furthermore, the way you talk about the 8-year-old child makes it so clear you resent her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYour stepdaughter and wife are in therapy because of your stepdaughters biodad. Your stepdaughter is not \"clingy\" - she is a traumatized child.\n\nI am *hoping* that this is just miscommunication and that it can be resolved between you. You locking yourself away in the guestroom and abandoning your wife with two children in need of care was an AH move. Yes, you deserve sleep as well. But you seem to have no consideration for the wellbeing of your stepdaughter.", ">He\u2019s been in prison for the past 5 years and both my wife and stepdaughter are in therapy because of him.\n\nWell, that's bad. A horrible thing, presumably multiple horrible things, happened to your wife and your stepdaughter. Time for you to show some empathy. \n\n> The only problem is, if her daughter wants to sleep with her when it\u2019s her night with the baby, she expects me to take her night.\n\nThat's actually not the only problem. The other problem is that your poor stepdaughter is still so damn traumatised that she needs help to sleep frequently. That must be exhausting both for her and your wife. \n\n>She just says her daughter needs her so I need to be with the baby that night.\n\nIt's almost like she thinks you're a married couple with two children!\n\n>she should either be willing to take one of my nights or do more chores around the house to make up for it. \n\nYou want your wife to \"make up\" for the fact that her daughter is traumatised? Talk about victim-blaming. \n\n> I told her I get that but she\u2019s still affecting my sleep by making me do her nights.\n\nChildren will do that. You married a woman who had a child and had another child. This is not something that happened to you, these were choices. \n\n>I told my wife she\u2019s still going to be with our baby that night then locked myself in the guest room.\n\nSo you left your wife stuck with taking care of two children because that seems fair to you?\n\n>she texted me a couple hours ago saying she\u2019s taking the kids to her mom\u2019s house.\n\nI hope for her and those poor kids that she stays there. You should have shown some damn empathy. YTA.", "YTA, your stepdaughter is clearly a traumatized kid. Now she's got to reconcile another kid of her mom's, which means sharing mom. That's a lot on a little kid.  You locking yourself away and not helping while mom takes care of older kiddo is ridiculous.  That's not being a partner.  I don't blame her for taking the kids to her mom, at least there she'll get some help.", "YTA \n\n\nImagine telling someone who is having to watch their daughter go though trauma all night to do extra chores on top to make up for it. Eeesh.", "YTA. First off, if you have a step-daughter, particularly one where you are the only man consistently in her life, stop referring to her as \u201cyour wife\u2019s daughter\u201d like she\u2019s a grown ass adult that lives 5 states away and you\u2019ve never met. Being a step parent means you step the fuck up with **both** of your children, biological or not. Right now you act and talk like your wife has two kids at home and you only have one. All you\u2019re doing right now, and trust me on this, is teaching her that men in general don\u2019t care about her well being or see her as being fully valued. Stop acting like a teenager, locking yourself in your room and talking about your **daughter** like she\u2019s someone else\u2019s troublesome pet, and be physically and emotionally there for everyone in your family, especially if they are traumatized.", "YTA. So your solution was that you should never be expected to go \u201cabove and beyond\u201d? Any \u201cextra\u201d work you do for your child requires compensation? \n\nWhat baffles me is that it\u2019s a well known fact that those sleepless baby nights don\u2019t last forever. So you are unwilling to do \u201cextra\u201d 2 or 3 nights a month (as you said once a week your stepdaughter may need her mom) for say 6 months to preserve your relationship with your family? \n\nYou also put a flashing billboard sign up for your wife making it clear you don\u2019t consider your stepdaughter as important as your new baby. So good luck with that.", "YTA. This baby is *your baby* and you need to take care of it. Stop trying to keep track and make everything perfectly 50/50. Parenthood is not a transaction. \n\nI cannot believe you *locked yourself in the guest room* rather than care for your baby in an attempt to force your wife to choose which of her children to care for.", "You have 2 children, the other one being your traumatised step child, please stop being so selfish and bullying this clearly disturbed little girl and hiding it through \u201cfairness\u201d YTA.", "YTA. When you choose a partner it\u2019s no longer all about you. It\u2019s not always equal. There\u2019s another child in the equation you clearly have little empathy for. Your wife is taking care of both kids, you are taking care of one. She is compromising just as much sleep, she just isn\u2019t doing it all for the child you share, which seems to be your hangup. You\u2019re treating this like a business investment. I\u2019m only invested in one child and should only put 50% into that one child. The other child is still so young and essentially has no dad. And this is the extra unnecessary drama you\u2019re making everyone\u2019s life worse with? It\u2019s only been TWO MONTHS FFS. You locked yourself in a room? What the actual\u2026how old are you again? Make it clear you care for the whole family unit and stick to that. All the kids need help. Otherwise, let her leave and find someone who will contribute with empathy and real love for her and her children.", "Sounds so much like missing reasons and this just being the last straw.", "This is a temporary issue: Step-daughter will hopefully start to feel less anxious with more therapy, and the baby will be sleeping through the night within a month or two.\n\nThe real issue is that you are unwilling to help your wife without playing tit-for-tat. All new parents are tired, but it\u2019s not going to last forever. You wife is still recovering mentally, emotionally, and physically from growing that baby and giving birth, and she also has to worry about her traumatized daughter, AND her own trauma from her ex. Be a better partner.", "YTA. Parenthood is not 50/50, it is 100/100. Your wife and children deserve much better than a part time father locking himself in a bedroom because it\u2019s not his turn. \n\nYou and your wife need to figure out how to wean the older daughter from this routine, but it\u2019s not going to happen by running away.", "YTA, you two are a team, she cannot be in 2 places at once when one kid is having issues, and the other needs her, you're a father, you're not a half time father, so step it up and watch your damn kid. You're lucky she agreed to a rotation like that, because either way that schedule would've eventually fell apart, but this is falling apart for your own selfish reasons. You're being neglectful to spite her, she's going to her moms to get the full support she needs and can't get from her own husband, that's just sad.", "INFO: is the therapy actually working? Has the stepdaughter gotten any better about wanting your wife to sleep in her room less, etc?   \n\n\nThis sounds like you need to have a talk with your wife about how the dynamic has changed with the new baby, and that the stepdaughter doesn't seem to be adjusting well to the change.", "YTA.         But on the bright side thanks for making me do some reflecting on my own parenting.", "YTA \n\nYou knowingly married and had a child with someone who had a child. You were aware of that child's issues and still decided to proceed. You're a dad of 2, 24/7 there shouldn't be my night or her night. That's your kids step-up and be be a good husband and dad.", "Are you actually serious? WTF. YTA. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s taking a vacation while you do all the work yourself. If she and her daughter from a previous relationship are still in therapy because of previous partner/dad, then obviously they are traumatized and yes, changing routines as is the case when a new baby is born does cause a change in feeling secure for awhile and can be very destabilizing. \n\nWhy can\u2019t your stepdaughter rely on you for comfort? Do you honestly believe your wife wants to get out of baby duty or quality time with her newborn because her older child is still traumatized because of her father? I can assure you that she is not. And you just had to take it a step further and lock yourself in the guest room. That\u2019s what pushed it into YTA territory for me. Otherwise I\u2019d give it a soft N A H.", "Sounds like a case of where's the rest of the story if there ever was one but YTA. She didn't just leave because of one act of petulant behavior from you this is a culmination of events of which we just have one.", "YTA - you chose to marry someone with kids. That means coparenting. Marriage means supporting your partner. You\u2019re doing neither.", "Well now he can sleep...", "Info needed:  does she work? Do you work? Who does most of the household chores? Childcare during the day?", "I understand your feelings about wanting fairness, but your stepdaughter is traumatized. I\u2019m withholding judgement for more info: What does the therapist say about your wife sleeping with the older daughter once a week?", "YTA - It\u2019s not like your wife is ditching you, she\u2019s looking after a child who has trauma. You have a new born, consistent sleep isn\u2019t a luxury new parents get for a while", "Honestly, you should take this to r/Parenting\nThe first year is horrific for marriages and it's a huge disruption for existing kids, nevermind those in the blended family who has gone through trauma.\nMarriage counseling can help you both.\n\nTrying to assign an AH isn't going to solve this dilemma.", "YTA. Your relationship shouldn't be so transactional.", "YTA. The kid is traumatized! Grow up.", "YTA- you obviously don\u2019t consider the 9 year old your daughter. After your wife divorces you, I would suggest that you not start a relationship with another woman who already has kids.", "What the hell did I just read? You\u2019re both parents\u2026like take the baby. I guess she\u2019s terrible at picking men. YTA", "Not a judgment here, but a suggestion for wife and older daughter.\n\nGet your wife to record some loving messages on her daughter's phone so the daughter can listen to them any time she needs to hear her mum's voice.", "Soft YTA - it's easy to feel like your partner isn't doing their fair share in the early months, especially when nobody is getting enough sleep, but locking yourself away from your infant to force your wife to do that night isn't a good solution.", "Sorry but YTA. \n\n\u201cIt affects my sleep.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve chosen to marry someone with a child. It\u2019s bound to come with constrains; the child is bound to make demands on your wife and the child comes first. (I should know, I\u2019m a step-parent too.)\n\nYou\u2019ve chosen to have a baby. Yes, the little blighters make mincemeat of your sleep patterns. Most mums get up each night, yes each night, then go to work the next day. \n\nSo kindly, stop moaning.", "YTA obviously. You clearly don't care one bit about your stepdaughter, and you think you have the right to opt out of parenting when you feel like it. You knew what you were getting into when you married your wife. If your stepdaughter's trauma is that damn inconvenient for you, you shouldn't have gotten married.", "Your step daughter's stepfather isn't a good guy either. YTA", "YTA but I doubt you will have to worry about the issue much longer. Get ready to enjoy your single life of not being awoken at night.", "Dude you bout to be skewered.", "INFO: How did you 50/50 divide up growing and birthing your 2 month old?", "YTA.  Stop keeping score and demanding compensation for tending to your own child and instead do what's needed by your family.\n\nI'm guessing your wife has a million other reasons for leaving, too.", "[removed]", "Literally everything about this sucks.  You mentioned that your wife and stepdaughter are in therapy, are you?", "YTA. Your stepdaughter is as much your responsibility as your bio daughter\u2026you knew they were a package deal when you got married/had a baby with your wife. You can either accept that or loose your wife and share custody of your bio daughter but clearly your wife is willing to die on this hill (and I would too)", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to bear the same love to your stepdaughter as your biological child and she will notice that at some point.  The poor girl is obviously traumatised and distressed and needs her mother perhaps more than before. Why not offer your wife and stepdaughter the support and take some extra \u201cbaby shifts\u201d?", "YTA. Surprise, as a parent, you sometimes have to parent. If you didn't want to have unpredictable schedules and waking up in the middle of the night to take care of a baby, you should've thought about that before you put the bun in the oven. You expected your wife to take care of two kids in the middle of the night by herself because it wAsN't YoUr TuRn. Grow a pair, apologize to your wife, and take care of the baby you signed up for.", "YTA - you are a partnership, but that doesn't mean you need to split all duties 50/50. It means you need to support each other and you need to support her by helping with the newborn on additional nights when she is supporting your step-daughter.\n\nThe fact that you'd put her in the situation of making her ignore one child to care for the other rather than help is beyond messed up. It's like you're trying to increase the overall household trauma.", "YTA.  I understand your wife's needing to sleep with her daughter, but she has another child that needs her too.  She can get up with the baby and go back to bed with the daughter.  You locking yourself in your room was an AH thing to do.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou're a father with a 2-month-old baby.  That means stepping up and doing what you need to do.  Locking yourself in the guestroom is the opposite of that.\n\nBased on what you've said, it sounds like your wife and stepdaughter have been through some trauma.  It probably wouldn't hurt them to get some therapy, but until that happens, the baby still needs someone to step up and be a parent - and that someone is you.\n\nIs it fair that you're having to cover her nights?  Probably not.  Does it suck that you aren't getting sleep?  Absolutely.  \n\nBut there are plenty of people out there that are single parents that still manage to step up and do what needs to be done - and single or not, you're a father.  Be one.", "Yeah, man...yta", "It's a baby. Neither of your are entitled to sleep for now, and for a long while.\n\nNewborns/infants are disruptive, especially to young children. The 9yo will adapt *in time*.\n\nYou presumably knew what you were getting into when you got married. None of this can be a surprise, can it?\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA- I get the feeling like you're pulling more than your weight here, but she has obligations to her daughter. I would encourage you to think about the extra time you get to bond with your child. I myself have a blended family and am primary care giver for my bio son when the step kids are over because they have special needs. As a result, I am my son's favorite person in the world, and that is priceless", "ESH.\n\nWhat you did was definitely an AH move. So you should absolutely apologize straight off.\n\nThat said, her refusing to look for any sort of compromise is an AH move on her part. True, she's not getting \"a night off\" but she also isn't being woken up frequently by your newborn, either, and the main point of taking turns is so that neither of you end up far more sleep deprived than the other.\n\nShe does sleep when she's in your stepdaughter's room, doesn't she?\n\nSo it's very unfair for her to ask you to take care of your daughter three days in a row. (your day, her day when stepdaughter needs her, your day)\n\nMy suggestion would be to reset your schedule if your stepdaughter needs your wife with her on one of your wife's nights taking care of the newborn. That way you do two days in a row, but then go back to alternating.\n\nIt would be more fair to you if you did two days in a row followed by your wife doing two days in a row. So IMO going back to alternating right away would be generous on your part, even if your wife doesn't see it that way.", "YTA. It\u2019s not a contract, it\u2019s a baby and your wife has another daughter that also takes time and effort and emotional support. Get rid of the schedule as children are unpredictable and frankly, a pain in the ass sometimes. They don\u2019t care about your schedule. It\u2019s not about you all of the time anymore. You think SHES not tired?", "YTA. You have a baby. Take care of it. You make it out to be like your wife is off doing something selfish and she\u2019s being neglectful.", "Light YTA to NAH. Only YTA because of how you handled it by locking yourself in the guest room. This is a conversation that needed to happen before one of these nights maybe even mediated by a counselor or therapist. \n\nThis is a unique family dynamic and stress and lashing out is a normal response and with love you will successfully work through it together. But the conversation needs to come from a place of understanding, mutual agreement, love, and compromise. Focus on the children and your mental ability to care for them first.", "YTA\n\nDivision of childcare gets a bit awkward with a stepchild involved.   Some stepparents take on more of a parent role with the stepchild and others leave it to the bio parent.   Your stepdaughter has trauma and needs someone to stay with her some nights, and it sounds like that person has to be your partner.  Your partner should try to encourage her daughter to sleep alone, and I am glad they are in counseling, but if her daughter truly needs her to be in there then she needs to be in there to take care of her child.  \n\nMy stepson can be clingy, and also has severe anxiety so he\u2019s much more comfortable with my husband than he is with me.   Therefore, I accepted early on that I am probably taking on more of the parenting with the child we have together.   Hopefully you have a better understanding of your partner\u2019s perspective and you can work through this.", "Is this your wife and step daughter or two roommates? YTA.", "At least you can add up all the extra days she's catching up by looking after your daughter at her mums while you sit at home /s\n\nYou need to think deeper on how your wife must feel having to deal with her other daughters trauma and how exhausting it must be for her.\n\nWhat you did was throw a tantrum and lock yourself in a  room all night. Just imagine how that must feel for her having to deal with both kids while you slept quietly in your locked room because you didn't get a 50/50 split because her little girl needed to be near her for the night.\n\nYTA", "So, your wife has a type, doesn't she? Because you're proving yourself to be another crappy husband and father.\n\nYou should be taking care of your child and helping your wife take care of your stepchild.\n\nYTA", "YTA, parenting is not tit for tat and 50/50 doesn't always mean you're both doing half of everything all the time. Clearly this is a challenging time for your stepdaughter and your wife is probably overcome with emotions about having the new baby, yet still needing and wanting to be that strong source of support and comfort for her eldest daughter. Suck it up and take the heavier load with the baby to support your wife and step daughter. Babies are babies for a very short period of time and they won't need so much care in the night for long in the grand scheme of things. You made the choice to disrupt your own sleep when you had a baby, that's not on your wife", "YTA. Are you 13? This is not the way for a grown adult to behave concerning his own wife and children.", "Wow dude are you 12? You locked yourself in a bedroom cause the sperm that turned into a baby, you couldn't be bothered to help with. Seriously she gave birth to a whole child and you are complaining about having to help a LITTLE EXTRA with YOUR child. Yes YTA.\n\nAlso why are you calling the woman who birthed your child, your wife when you can't even call her daughter YOUR STEPDAUGHTER. You're a bigger AH than I thought after thinking about that wording.", "YTA.  Soft one, but you are missing you have two children and one specifically needs only her while it sounds like the other can do with either.  She\u2019s not taking the night off and locking yourself in your room is not the answer.  You chose to marry someone with a kid.  Stop resenting the kid in crisis and suck it up about your sleep.", "YTA. Sounds like she feels it would be a lot easier for her to just not have to deal with your lack of empathy and caring. Also if you really cared you wouldn\u2019t wait until after work to try to speak to her. It doesn\u2019t sound like you care much about her at all.", "YTA", "NAH, but I really don't think you should pick this hill to die on. Your daughter is 2mo old. Your wife spent the last 10mo with your daughter living INSIDE her. \n\nI get that you're both probably very tired and trying to manage... but I think you should give a little here, especially considering it's only \\~1x per week.", "YTA as a stepchild of a man who very much didn\u2019t see me as his own. You don\u2019t seem to see her as family. You don\u2019t seem to have any compassion what she\u2019s been through. I will say your wife should talk to their therapist about sleep as eventually the daughter WILL need to sleep on her own. But at this moment she has a lot to cope with and you need to be a little more understanding.", "YTA.", "YTA - Not good for anyone to keep score like that, just ends in frustration.", "ESH because: \n\nIf I was in this situation, I would additionally switch with my husband to take his nights.

Yeah it definitely sucks to just put your baby with someone who might not fully pay attention to them, but also I definitely understand why you want and need some level of compromise about turns with the baby because it will absolutely effect your sleep a lot more than sharing a bed with a 9 year old will. I am going to say NTA, but it is close because of how it was handled. I understand where rash actions can come from given your possible sleep deprivation and frustration, but it still probably was overly aggressive. The wife is still definitely an AH for refusing any attempt to compromise. It\u2019s not like you refused to help in general, you just wanted her to do her same fair share with the baby. It\u2019s not fair to you, even if she is doing something else.", "YTA. Could be that her ex is in prison because of DV? And that she was thinking: nope, not again!", "Info: how many days of carrying a baby did you take?", "YTA", "Yes YTA.  Parenting isn't about tit for tat.  It's all the time every day all day.  I get that you might be frustrated with step daughter but she also seems quite traumatized. Have you ever volunteered to hang out with her and read a book to her for bedtime? Connecting in some way? You're starting to resent her and it's noticeable.  Single parents do the whole job all the time.  You're sharing the job but still a bit whiney. It's it really asking so much for you to do just a little more?", "YTA.  \n\nIf the 9 year old were not your stepdaughter but your biological daughter, would you have acted this way?  I doubt it.  You would be totally ok with extra baby night duty so that your wife could tend to your 9 year old's needs bc you love both kids.\n\nYou implicitly communicated to your wife that you don't love your stepdaughter.

He\u2019s been in prison for the past 5 years and both my wife and stepdaughter are in therapy because of him. \n\nMy stepdaughter has always been clingy with my wife. She doesn\u2019t sleep if my wife doesn\u2019t lay down with her until she falls asleep. Sometimes she uses the phone at school to call my wife just because she needs to hear her voice. She also has nightmares and needs my wife to sleep in her bed fairly often. \n\nShe has been even worse since we had the baby. My wife says it\u2019s because her routine is disrupted and she needs time to get used to having another person in the house and all of the changes but this means that she has been sleeping in her daughter\u2019s room at least one night a week for the past two months. \n\nMy wife and I rotate who has to get up with the baby at night. One night it\u2019s her, next is me, then back to her, etc. and it has worked well for us so far. The only problem is, if her daughter wants to sleep with her when it\u2019s her night with the baby, she expects me to take her night. She won\u2019t switch nights with me or try to make it up in any way. She just says her daughter needs her so I need to be with the baby that night. \n\nI talked to her about it and said that if something comes up and she needs me to take her night, she should either be willing to take one of my nights or do more chores around the house to make up for it. She got defensive and refused because she\u2019s not getting a night off, she\u2019s taking care of her traumatized older daughter. I told her I get that but she\u2019s still affecting my sleep by making me do her nights. \n\nLast night was her night. At 8, her daughter said she wanted my wife to sleep in her room. When she said that, I told my wife she\u2019s still going to be with our baby that night then locked myself in the guest room. My wife didn\u2019t speak to me last night or this morning but she texted me a couple hours ago saying she\u2019s taking the kids to her mom\u2019s house. I checked our cameras and she filled her trunk with suitcases and even threw some bags in her front seat. \n\nI\u2019m going to go to her moms house to talk to her after work but I wanted to know if I was the asshole for not taking the baby on her nights.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

For goodness sake that is a traumatized CHILD have some compassion man!", "ESH. Both of you suck by refusing to parent both kids together. If grandma is willing to look after the baby at night, sounds like her moving back is the best solution until the baby can sleep through the night. Both of you are acting in extreme ultimatums. That doesn\u2019t foretell long term success.", "ESH. You both need to compromise. You should stick with your one-on-one off routine of taking care of the baby at night however your wife needs to also understand that she has a duty to help her daughter acclimate versus acclimate the situation to her daughter and that can be done in a very helpful and conducive way but now everybody's disrupted the situation even more so it's arguably worse. Both parties that are adult need to start behaving like adults", "Jesus christ!.\n\nThis is a baby, your OWN baby, not a chore to be only dealt with strictly by rota.  It's not surprising that you don't understand why she has to be there for her other traumatised child, because you don't even seem to understand that you need to be there for the one you share!.\n\nIf a baby is crying and needs a parent, it shouldn't be an argument over who's night it is.

This is not healthy. \n\n>she doesn\u2019t sleep if my wife doesn\u2019t lay down with her until she falls asleep\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty serious problem. From your post I\u2019m guessing it has to do with what she endured from her bio father, but she\u2019s been in therapy for years and this is still happening?

This needs to be addressed because it is going to affect the marriage and your wife\u2019s relationship with the newborn. \n\nOn the other hand, YTA, because from the info in your post it seems that you knew your wife not only had a daughter but that the other parent was not actively involved. You should\u2019ve assumed that this would come with some extra effort and commitment on your part. She is YOUR daughter too, but it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t see it that way which is very likely contributing to your step-daughters trauma and fear of abandonment. \nLocking yourself in the guest room makes you sound like you are five years old.
