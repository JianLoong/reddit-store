It\u2019s not rocket science. And tbh, the bigger the wedding and budget, often the easier it is to throw it because you can afford to hire florists, planners and other staff. I\u2019m more impressed by the women DIY\u2019ing their flowers and schlepping a cake in the back of their car! Lol. Impressive multitasking and organization skills! \n\nIt also wears thin when someone is flashing someone else\u2019s money (such as your dad\u2019s). (Might be projecting about acquaintances who flash their husband\u2019s money while they\u2019ve never worked a day in their lives, though).  :) \n\nI mean she shouldn\u2019t have said anything. She should\u2019ve just excused herself from the conversation, or internally rolled her eyes, or whatever. It was wrong of her to start the drama like that. So esh.", "I'm going with ESH. \n\nBased on your, ....\"wedding like this and not everyone can handle it\", it's possible that in conversations, you're coming off a bit....Much. And it's possibly why your \"step cousin\" spoke up. Without knowing you both or the situation, I of course, can't say for sure, but it does sound like these types of comments might be common in your conversations and she was simply just calling it like she saw it. \n\nWas her way of \"calling it like she saw it\" the best way? Maybe not. She could have just walked away or approached you about things later or...Whatever. But it really sounds like she was just calling you out on your behavior and you called her jealous.", "Esh. Your comment absolutely throws shade, and Ella's took it personally whether you meant it that way and reacted as such. \n\nSeriously though,  not everyone can handle planning the wedding they want? You have some ego. I guarantee any bride who *wants* a big wedding will get it done.", "ESH.\nShe was confrontational, but also what a silly thing to say. Not everyone can handle a fancy wedding? C\u2019mon.", "ESH - verging on YTA -  your 'not everyone can handle it' was obnoxious and that is with you telling the story.", "ESH. You don't come across as innocent as you think. Your attitude about the wedding as a whole comes through and she was probably picking up on that. Was she jealous? Maybe. But maybe she just wanted to talk about something else that everyone could participate in the conversation about, instead of having to listen to you drone on about how it's \"so hard\" to plan the wedding you want.

And I don't think you're a reliable narrator to know if it was or not.\n\nIf it was I completely understand Ella's comment and trust me, it doesn't come out of jealousy.\n\nEven if it wasn't, someone saying they're sick of how much you talk about how hard it is to plan a wedding doesn't have to be out of jealousy, but just out of boredom and lack of interest in the matter.\n\nThe fact that you immediately jumped to jealousy tells me you think your wedding is more important to others than it actually is.\n\nThere are too many unknowns so it's hard to give a judgement. I'll assume my bias and go with YTA because people tend to assume everyone who doesn't care about their wedding is just jealous. I'm assuming you're like that.

You started the entire mess by being on the high horse how exceptional you are to be able to plan a wedding.", "ESH Honestly, at no point in your post did you say how many times you have been harping about your wedding. Yes, Ella got incredibly snarky and immature, but you were also confrontational to her, and very condescending.

Your step cousin was being unpleasant and rude for sure, but name calling was just unnecessarily escalating the conflict. \n\nIf you had fallen silent and just looked at her - and REALLY let the awkward silence drag out - it would have put the spotlight on her rudeness much more efficiently. Sometimes it works to let the devil speak for himself.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t need to react the way you did, but she absolutely is jealous and trying to bring you down a peg.", "ESH.  You say you're both in your 20s but you sound like middleschoolers.", "ESH...name calling is immature.  Losing your cool is immature.  Being snarky is immature. You both could have handled this way better.  It wasn't a big deal and you both just....yeah.  Kindness, compassion, and class \u2764\ufe0f  Try it out!", "Nta, she started it, she should have expected a retort when she instigated one. Also weddings have a lot of moving parts that can be hard to work together, especially large weddings, wedding planners exist for a reason.", "Nta, she is clearly jealous and all you did was reciprocate. If she couldn't handle it, she shouldn't have said anything. It's not like you barged in with the wedding details. People were asking you.", "Turn around is fair play in this case.\nIf she can't handle being called out after calling you out.\nShe could have used her feet and move from the conversation when the topic wasn't to her liking.\n\nNta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu got her there.", "No, you are not the Asshole. She wanted to draw attention to herself because she was jealous of all the attention you were getting. You are no having a show off wedding, you are just doing what make you happy. She was just trying to get peoples attention (which she succeeded at) in my opinion I feel like she will probably try to do this again before the wedding. If she does, what I would do warn her about uninviting her to the wedding. And if she continues just uninvited her\n\nEdit: for all the people downvoting my comment, yes she is immature for name calling. But because I know people like her step cousin, I\u2019m just guessing what the step cousin might do. And I\u2019m offering a simple adult solution for if the girl continues.  If she continues with the name calling and such, she will be viewed as immature and a jerk. If she just warns her and uninvites her. She would be getting rid of the problem. But as another solution, I would maybe just talk to the people who want to talk about your wedding. Incase she wasn\u2019t being attention seeking, and was just left out and bored. So maybe find the group that wants to talk about your wedding and let other people talk about other things. But if she does go out of her way to tell you what she did in your story. Once again warn and uninvite her. But if the wedding was all you talked about. ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Personally, I took the cousin\u2019s (paraphrased) reply to be fighting words: 'Okay we get it, you're using daddy's money for a royal wedding and think not everyone can do that, could we move on to something else or are you not done dragging'. Like accusing OP of bragging, dragging, and likening her wedding to a royal wedding?? Like this family has potluck events so I imagine that an \u201cextravagant\u201d wedding is like a plated dinner affair.\n\nNonetheless, I\u2019m sure that conversation would have gone very differently if OP drew back to how grateful she is for her parent\u2019s financial support. I did read the OP\u2019s replies in the thread, which provided some context to her relationship with Ella. Ella had gotten married recently in a simple church wedding, and continued to say that OP should do the same because she did. Personally, I find it so irritating when people say \u201cyou should\u2026\u201d especially when they say it repeatedly and don\u2019t know you. I can understand how things festered and built up between the two. Ella must also be quite rude and know-it-allish to say what she said. \n\nI guess that I\u2019m empathetic because it seems like if you get engaged, people have a fervor to ask you about your wedding plans and then to tell you how it\u2019s so dumb to have a wedding and how they just got married at a McDonald\u2019s wearing a dress from Goodwill (and that you should too!)  Based on the additional context I read, it seems that Ella has been taking digs at OP\u2019s wedding plans for a bit now. As someone who is paying for my own wedding with my (male) fianc\u00e9 who wants the wedding (and wants to host all of our guests for a fabulous evening), I also find it so frustrating and sexist when people talk to me (future bride) like I\u2019m a stupid idiot for planning/desiring a wedding. People often assume that it\u2019s the bride who demanded a wedding and that the groom and parents were so smart and practical, but begrudgingly contribute financially to the bride\u2019s deranged princess fantasy. In my experience, the parents and groom often want to invite a good deal of guests and are equally invested in providing a nice spread for guests. They often want to take the occasion to play host!\n\nNonetheless, I do not disagree with the sentiment of many posters\u2026 coming off as complainy about your extravagant wedding is a bad, bad look.", "I think you just answered your own question.  Presumably, someone did say that.", "No, because you assumed the wrong thing. The comment referred to OP's comments and tone, not that she is having a big wedding.", "I don\u2019t disagree - \u201cnot everyone can handle it\u201d comes off cringey. But Ella\u2019s response was absolutely unhinged. I think that we all have foot in mouth moments and that we might say the wrong thing or come off in a rude way (after all, OP is only 26). The step-cousin\u2019s response was just so confrontational and escalating. Step cousin must be a pretty obnoxious person to say that in the first place. It would take a very emotionally mature person to sit there and say nothing, which of course would have been preferable. Just being realistic here\u2026 I know that I would have defended myself if a step cousin did that to me. Other context I read in this thread is that Ella had previously commented (repeatedly) on how the OP should just have a small wedding like she did. I think that it\u2019s understandable if someone repeatedly says \u201cyou should do this, because I did\u201d that the recipient of the unsolicited advice will be worn down and lose their patience.", "What OP said: \n\n>  it's more difficult than it looks to organize a wedding like this and **not everyone can handle it**\n\nWhat Girl in Red said\n\n> She **didn't say** other people couldn't do it\n\nAgain, I'm not debating that wedding planning is stressful and hard. It is.\n\nBut saying \"people don't want to do this because it's a lot work\" means something different from \"people cannot do this\" and judging OP while mentally changing her words is not it.", "Not someone like op."]}
