A few of us including her were chatting, and I was talking about my wedding prep. (People were asking questions.) I said something about how it's more difficult than it looks to organize a wedding like this and not everyone can handle it, but we're really excited for the big day and to celebrate with everyone.\n\nElla got really snarky and said something like 'Okay we get it, you're using daddy's money for a royal wedding and think not everyone can do that, could we move on to something else or are you not done dragging'\n\nWe got into a bit of an argument and I said we were all just chatting and and green isn't a good color on her. She laughed and said no one's jealous of me, I replied clearly she is because she's acting like a jealous bitch.\n\nElla got pissed and some people agree, but others are telling me I went too far.

It\u2019s not rocket science. And tbh, the bigger the wedding and budget, often the easier it is to throw it because you can afford to hire florists, planners and other staff. I\u2019m more impressed by the women DIY\u2019ing their flowers and schlepping a cake in the back of their car! Lol. Impressive multitasking and organization skills! \n\nIt also wears thin when someone is flashing someone else\u2019s money (such as your dad\u2019s). (Might be projecting about acquaintances who flash their husband\u2019s money while they\u2019ve never worked a day in their lives, though).  :) \n\nI mean she shouldn\u2019t have said anything. She should\u2019ve just excused herself from the conversation, or internally rolled her eyes, or whatever. It was wrong of her to start the drama like that. So esh.", "I'm going with ESH. \n\nBased on your, ....\"wedding like this and not everyone can handle it\", it's possible that in conversations, you're coming off a bit....Much. And it's possibly why your \"step cousin\" spoke up. Without knowing you both or the situation, I of course, can't say for sure, but it does sound like these types of comments might be common in your conversations and she was simply just calling it like she saw it. \n\nWas her way of \"calling it like she saw it\" the best way? Maybe not. She could have just walked away or approached you about things later or...Whatever. But it really sounds like she was just calling you out on your behavior and you called her jealous.", "Esh. Your comment absolutely throws shade, and Ella's took it personally whether you meant it that way and reacted as such. \n\nSeriously though,  not everyone can handle planning the wedding they want? You have some ego. I guarantee any bride who *wants* a big wedding will get it done.", "ESH.\nShe was confrontational, but also what a silly thing to say. Not everyone can handle a fancy wedding? C\u2019mon.", "ESH - verging on YTA -  your 'not everyone can handle it' was obnoxious and that is with you telling the story.", "ESH. You don't come across as innocent as you think. Your attitude about the wedding as a whole comes through and she was probably picking up on that. Was she jealous? Maybe. But maybe she just wanted to talk about something else that everyone could participate in the conversation about, instead of having to listen to you drone on about how it's \"so hard\" to plan the wedding you want.

I can clearly picture a spoiled rich brat going on about how it's so much work but SOOO worth it and like you know not everyone could do this, we're so special.\n\nI don't know if this is how you sounded. And I don't think you're a reliable narrator to know if it was or not.\n\nIf it was I completely understand Ella's comment and trust me, it doesn't come out of jealousy.\n\nEven if it wasn't, someone saying they're sick of how much you talk about how hard it is to plan a wedding doesn't have to be out of jealousy, but just out of boredom and lack of interest in the matter.\n\nThe fact that you immediately jumped to jealousy tells me you think your wedding is more important to others than it actually is.\n\nThere are too many unknowns so it's hard to give a judgement. I'll assume my bias and go with YTA because people tend to assume everyone who doesn't care about their wedding is just jealous. I'm assuming you're like that.

You started the entire mess by being on the high horse how exceptional you are to be able to plan a wedding.", "ESH Honestly, at no point in your post did you say how many times you have been harping about your wedding. Yes, Ella got incredibly snarky and immature, but you were also confrontational to her, and very condescending.

Your step cousin was being unpleasant and rude for sure, but name calling was just unnecessarily escalating the conflict. \n\nIf you had fallen silent and just looked at her - and REALLY let the awkward silence drag out - it would have put the spotlight on her rudeness much more efficiently.

She wanted to draw attention to herself because she was jealous of all the attention you were getting. You are no having a show off wedding, you are just doing what make you happy.
