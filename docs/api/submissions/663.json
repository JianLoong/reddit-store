I get you were trying to do a nice thing for your SIL, but you made a bad call here. You stubbornly insisted on going to a restaurant you and your husband knew you\u2019d have a problem with. You blatantly lied about wanting to go there. You inadvertently ruined the evening for the whole family because they were so worried about you the whole time. You ended up putting your SIL in the hot seat for wanting to go there even though YOU are the one who insisted on it.

Don't be the \"martyr.\"\n\nI'm not saying you should choose a steak restaurant if everyone else is a vegetarian; it's OK to have a little consideration for others.\n\nBut do you think everyone else enjoyed themselves watching you trying not to vomit all night?

Despite that, the truth came out and nobody had a good time. It's always better just to be honest.", "YTA. You ended up being visibly uncomfortable, which likely dampened the mood of the entire evening. You need to learn to stick up for yourself and not people-please to your own detriment.

Don't let others choose for you especially when it's detrimental to yourself.  You matter, your choices are important, you get to make yourself happy.  I highly doubt when your SIL gets to choose, she will take your preferences into consideration.  \n\nYou may benefit from reading the book The Nice Girl Syndrome.  It shows that being nice really isn't, especially to yourself.  \n\nYou're going to have a lot of people wanting you to please them with access and authority over your child.

You meant well, but so did your in-laws and by picking a place you clearly didn't enjoy you sent a message to them that you don't appreciate their concern for you. Like others have pointed out, insisting on playing a martyr doesn't actually make anyone happy. Just like you wanted to make your SIL happy, your in-laws wanted to do that for you, and your behaviour ended up making everyone feel unhappy. A 16 year old isn't a small child, she would understand your needs and she could have gone to her preferred restaurant at some other time. But while I think you were needlessly self-sacrificial, I would not go as far as calling you the AH. You were acting in good faith, and that counts for something.", "I don\u2019t really wanna call you an AH, so NAH, but being nice at the majority\u2019s expense usually doesn\u2019t end up being that nice overall. You didn\u2019t get to eat, husband had to take you somewhere else afterwards, sounds like everyone was uncomfortable and concerned at dinner, and now a 16 year old is probably gonna get to take the heat for it from your in-laws who are just trying to teach their child to be considerate of others.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We are definitely going to go after the baby comes though!\" It's one thing to politely go somewhere that you normally wouldn't just to make someone else happy, but its another to go somewhere that you know will make you sick.

It sounds like she would have been okay with that and understood the occasion wasn\u2019t about focusing on her. \n\nBy insisting that you go to this restaurant that you clearly didn\u2019t enjoy you are teaching your SiL that it\u2019s actually not okay to hear no, that if she\u2019s sad enough or expressive enough people will give her what she wants, and that people should always put her wants over their own needs.\n\nMaybe it doesn\u2019t stick because no one else is reinforcing that message. However, it shouldn\u2019t have been conveyed from the start.\n\nI would also like to gently point out that if you do this now, before you have a child, you are more likely to do it with your own kid. It happens more and more, and the chances are which that one day you\u2019ll realize that the people you love will expect you to dismiss your own wants and needs every time because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve taught them.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to lose your identity as a parent. Be mindful of how you are telling others to treat you.", "It was worth everyone getting mad at her? Info, did you defend her?", "Is SIL going through a really hard time right now? Was this a special day for her? What made you prioritize her wants over your actual needs? \n\nI don't understand your decision or your reaction to everyone else's concern for you. You could have said, \"SIL, I know you want to go there but I can't really eat anything there. Why don't we look together for a place that will make us both really happy?\" Instead you just decided to martyr yourself to do exactly what she wanted? When you could have come to a compromise where you both would \"win\"? This makes no sense to me with the current context you've given. And actually makes me worry about how you are going to parent - are you going to give in to your own children's every whim at the expense of yourself and others?", "Made herself sick in the process and everyone else uncomfortable. Yay her \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd23", "I do..I doubt the 16 year old was paying & at that age she should know that you let the pregnant woman decide where to eat .", "It matters because the 16 year old is old enough that if they want to go to a specific restaurant, they can figure that shit out on their own. It's different to, say, a ten year old who might otherwise never get to go because they only get to go where their parents say. The 16 year old can get their own ass to the restaurant, on their own time, with their own friends - and can thus *handle* not being able to go with the whole family.", "acting like a martyr LMAOO she was trying to be NICE you guys are all so dramatic. She isn't deadly allergic to seafood, just uncomfortable by it, and thought it wouldn't be too bad to sit through ONE dinner. The real asswholes here are her inlaws and her husband AND you all for simply not getting over a not that big of deal incident. You all just sound miserable.", "Plus she\u2019s pregnant so \u2026..", "Nausea isn\u2019t sickness. I get nauseous when I walk into a port-a-potty on a warm summer afternoon. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m sick. \n\nNausea being a symptom of sickness, now that is will give you.", ">They were also unhappy with my SIL as they as they blamed her for me picking that restaurant. \n\nPretty straightforward right there.", "It\u2019s reddit (specifically aita). It will never make sense", "Never really been a fan  I'm sure i'll hear it eventually.", "There\u2019s no need to be rude about it.", "But it doesn't sound as if the SIL insisted on that restaurant. She asked and OP then said she also wanted that restaurant. Unless SIL is spoiled brat, she would have understood and been OK with another choice. If she wouldn't have been, then the family has a bigger problem than OP agreeing to the restaurant.", "Absolutely nothing she did risked her or her babies health. Vomiting during pregnancy is extremely common. Sensitivity to smells is very common. None of that is dangerous in any way. \n\nYou're all being completely hyperbolic and ridiculous. Such is the way of this sub when they've decided someone's TA. Logic goes out the window in favour of everyone getting their digs in.", "Ugh no. I don\u2019t admire martyrs and how selfishly they say it\u2019s all about someone else when it turns out the whole time they get all the fawning attention. I can\u2019t believe that she was so oblivious to the fact that her in laws were going to make a fuss over the pregnant daughter-in-law. Also she can\u2019t simultaneously be like \u201cmy SIL is happy so therefore it\u2019s worth it\u201d when in her post SIL\u2019s parents blamed her for suggesting a place. \n\nIt\u2019s obnoxious, asshole behavior.", "I'm pretty sure she thought she'd be able to somewhat have it all under control , yall sound like some miserable ass people.", "Y\u2019all are acting like the 16 year old was begging to go lmao\u2026..she made a suggestion, dad said let OP pick and OP Agreed with the suggestion knowing it would cause drama. \n\nThere is no indication the 16 year old was dying to go there or anything like that, she literally just threw out a suggestion and OP made it into a whole thing so she could get attention the whole night not eating and gagging and letting everyone worry and fret over her whole saying \u201c*sigh* I\u2019m fine guys really\u2026.*gag*\u2026.pay no mind to me over here. I\u2019m just Pregnant and suffering, no big deal *sighhhhh*\u2022", "The 16 year old didn\u2019t do anything.", "Do you voluntarily put yourself into summer port-a-potties because a teenager wants you to? I\u2019m not sure how there\u2019s an argument that any of this was beneficial for a pregnant woman. It\u2019s nitpicking.", "I have a chronic Illness that has nausea as a side effect . It IS sickness .", "If you are on TikTok, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard parts of it   \u201cHi. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me.\u201d", "It\u2019s awesome how you start off by being rude to me and then complain about me being rude to you. I think you must be the dramatic one.", "You\u2019re way more right than I am. Pregnant women tend to make a big deal about food especially what they can and can\u2019t eat and what they will and won\u2019t eat. When my pregnant SIL was in town, we would choose multiple restaurants every night and let her decide if there were any clear winners or losers based on their menu.\n\nAfter reading your comment, this feels more like an awkward attention grab to come across as nice for the SIL but still get pity.", "Yea it is nitpicking. OP seems to empathetic to the point she would put her discomfort to the side for others. I just find it hard to call her an asshole for that.", "I\u2019m on medication that makes me nauseous all the time it\u2019s definitely it\u2019s own sickness", "I\u2019ve had a bad take. I\u2019m just being picky and was trying to argue that nausea would be from an illness and not an illness in and of itself. I\u2019ll stop.", "I concur. After the comments it definitely comes across as attention seeking/ martyr behavior", "It might have been nice if it didn\u2019t ruin dinner. Multiple bothered adults outweigh a single happy teenager (who probably wasn\u2019t so happy after being blamed for the predictable disaster)", "I absolutely hate it . I take zofran but it\u2019s kind of hard to take pills when you just want to hurl. I\u2019m ultra sensitive to smells & it really sucks when you\u2019re in pain and nauseous. I\u2019m always thinking \u201cone or the other but please not both \u201c", "I agree, OP had a good sentiment but it just didn\u2019t go the way I think she had imagined it going.", "The smell part is terrible, like can barley be around food, like have to eat but I have no desire to do so and am terrified to eat the wrong thing and throw up (which has happened) \nI\u2019m sorry you have that and pain as well"]}
