Sometimes randomly staying the night in the guest room, coming over to watch TV or make some food even when John and I are not home etc. This was incredibly jarring for me because it felt like there was no privacy left to be within the house when all these people could just come in, borrow things, use the apartment and leave.

Your BF said they provide for you guys so what is it? This I don't understand since it seems like they don't provide anything.", "No judgement, but you used the wrong term for what happened. You did not set a boundary, you made a rule. A boundary in this situation would be, \"BF I am uncomfortable with how your family comes in and out of the apartment freely. I need to have a reasonable expectation for privacy when I am at home. To accomplish that I would like your family to call before coming over in the future. If your family continues to come over unannounced I will find a new place to live that meets my needs.\" Boundaries are about your behavior (to meet my need for privacy I will live somewhere else) to meet a need. \n\nYou made a rule, which is a unilateral decision about how others will behave, \"You will tell your family they aren't allowed here anymore.\"", "What the\u2026..???\n\nHe gave everyone in the family KEYS??

The correct thing to do is talk to John about it privately, saying I know you told me family would be in and out, but this isn't working for me, I didn't realize how much it would bother me, etc.", "YTA\n\nIf this is an issue then talk to your partner about it first, don't just wait until you snap. With relationships, especially where the people involved are from different cultures, you've got to have open communication about things that bother you. I'm sure they're not deliberately being rude, they've just got different ideas of what's acceptable. So don't accuse them of being rude just explain how it makes you feel, why you find it difficult to live like this and then listen to why they think this is an ok situation and work out how best to manage it so that you're both relatively happy with what's happening. Or if you can't come to an agreement about this you'll probably have to break up", "Given that he told you about this before you moved in, YTA.\n\nBut girl, take my advice and break up with him.

Source: I am an Indian woman.", "YTA. \"I asked her why she thought she just had the random right to come into our apartment whenever she felt like it.\" Because that's literally what you and John *told* her. Per your comments, he was completely upfront with you about how often his family would be in and out, and you didn't voice any objections. If you're now feeling differently, that's a conversation to have with John, and gives you no right to yell at his sister.", "\"Violating the boundaries of our apartment\"...\n\nWhat boundaries? YTA, girl bye", "NTA but neither is John. Based off your comments John did make you aware his family would be in and out of the house often. However, \u201coften,\u201d is subjective. Your amount of often can be one to step days a week all before noon. Where his \u201coften,\u201d basically meant they have free range.\n\nThis is a culture dispute and I feel that the both of you need to have an actual conversation with transparency.

Some are studying and so come to the apartment when they don't have classes and such. The others come over on the weekends etc when they don't have to commute to work. Basically this is a shared accommodation between all of them, with John being the primary resident.\n\nIn this scenario OP moved in and by virtue of being John's GF she assumed that she has greater rights to the place than all other roommates who have been here longer than her. This is where she's messed up. \n\nOne - John is not the sole resident. There are other roommates who share the expenses. So they have equal rights and they have lived here longer than she has. They all have their own set of keys, which means an understanding that they live there and are free yo use the place as they like.\n\nTwo - if you look into the situation from an Indian context, OP has no rights at all.

It's fine to have boundaries, but they need to actually be stated -- you can't just expect people to intuit them. It seems like the first time you actually said something about this was when you made a snippy and aggressive comment to his sister. \n\n>I asked her why she thought she just had the random right to come into our apartment whenever she felt like it and use whatever she wanted\n\nMaybe she thinks that because John (again, the owner of the apartment) has told her it's ok?

His family is doing nothing wrong in this situation given they have your boyfriend's permission. He's the one you need to bring this issue up with, and unfortunately starting that discussion this way isn't doing you any favors. This sounds like something that should have been discussed before moving in tbh.", "I know it\u2019s his normal family dynamic and that it\u2019s his apartment, but he lives with you now and he has to take into account your legs type and concerns.  When living with partners we may need to compromise.  Especially, women, in my experience, do not appreciate having random male visitors unannounced in their home.  OP should feel comfortable in her own home and that means setting limits to access to the apartment that she is also living in.

And I refuse, and he knows I\u2019m not a good receiver. And we know he would never offer and feel this way about anyone else - cause how I helped him without asking anything in return. That was now 10+ years ago, his support was during covid. Goes to show why we are this way, putting the family we choose to call family above money or comfort. Because, when it works out it\u2019s for life. Thick or thin. It\u2019s not for everyone though, like my ex I met said friends through which didn\u2019t last. Or the now ex-gf of said friend who asked me why I even bother with her bf being my friend, helping him. My ex was more individualist than he thought. I was a novelty to that guy. But somewhere in the mess, I met a brother. I\u2019ll see my ex at his wedding lol\n\nBtw I loved knowing my home was a safe haven, and I never knew who might be there but they were people who could jive with me in any circumstances. And we only brought people in we felt that way with. It diffuses the issue of what mood you\u2019re in when they\u2019re there. Also they are trusted not to creep stuff or steal. It\u2019s called trust and love imho. Each place I lived had such a group and I was home base. It was like coming home to a tribe of support who know how to flow with you.\n\nTo each their own, but that\u2019s why\u2026ime - you\u2019re busy whining about the differences, instead of experiencing life with him.

It\u2019s considered our duty and obligation to be able to accommodate any member of our family and help them in whatever way possible- wishes and comfort of a group outweighs the wishes of a person- collectivism over individualism. \n\nAlthough I am a fully independent working adult, I will always have a set of his keys to my parents house and can show up whenever and stay however long because it\u2019s considered to be just as much my house no matter how long it\u2019s been since I moved out.

You probably haven\u2019t been dating for too long because you don\u2019t seem too familiar with his family and just see them as intruders. Apologize to the girl you yelled at and move out if it bothers you so much. Having separate places to live is quite healthy.", "Mild YTA. It sounds like you kicked her out without discussing boundaries with your partner.\n\nIt sounds like he had this place before you, and he had established habits with his family that they could come over whenever.\n\nYou living there *does* mean that things should change a bit. You deserve to be able to use your home without feeling invaded. \n\nHOWEVER, you should have first talked to John. Decide together what boundaries to set with his family. Then, he and/or you could communicate those to his family. **His family can't adjust to new boundaries if no one communicates them.**\n\nBy just unleashing your frustration on someone who had no idea the rules had changed... you became the asshole.", "Given he is 24, it is highly likely that his parents paid for the apartment, or even that several family members paid for it - which would explain his comment about family providing for him, and his feeling a duty to give it back.  In that scenario, if I were his parents and I heard about this, I would be livid with you kicking out the cousin, as their family (or even just John) probably invested in this apartment as a family home for all of the relatives living in the area. \n\nYou need to be realistic here - while you are paying for some utilities, you have no stake in this apartment because you are contributing neither to equity nor rent and your name is not on the title. That not only puts you on the back foot, it puts you in a literal choosy beggar situation.  You would have full rights to put up boundaries if you paid rent, mortgage, or equity into the property, but you should really think about whether you have that right (morally or legally) to do that when he (and likely his family) are letting you stay there rent free. I don\u2019t think merely paying for a portion of utilities gets you there, especially if it\u2019s the case that the apartment was paid for by his family.", "There\u2019s no indication in the post, because OP didn\u2019t put it together yet. He\u2019s 24 and bought an apartment in New York City. It should be common sense.", "No she doesn't.  She says that he told her they would be over a lot.  That is not, \"We will give them keys and they will come and go as they please\"\n\nJesus, there is no need to make shit up", "She said he said they would be in and out, however she didn't say they that they would be in and out when they weren't home or that they wouldn't let them know before hand. Which can be an important etiquette difference. I had relatives that popped over on occasion growing up and some that lived with us. But other than those that shared our home no one just came in randomly and decided to make themselves dinner. \n\nAs a very private person, I would be highly offended by this. If we share a domicile it's different, but I'd never be ok with someone I only peripherally knew through my SO  being in my home when I came home with no notice or them not being there. \n\nThis needs a serious sit down conversation with both sides coming to a mutual understanding and possibly couple's counseling. It really should have been detailed before moving in honestly. \n\nIt is hard to say on this one but I'm going with ESH, \n\nOP - allowing herself to become so upset that she exploded before actually making this a conversation.\n\nBoyfriend - Not detailing the complete situation and relationship of the people and establishing a boundary when his girlfriend expressed concerns.\n\nOthers - For randomly popping in and cooking/watching TV hanging out without at least letting home owners know once another person was added to the dynamic.", "I\u2019d go with YTA for being rude to the cousin rather than setting boundaries with the boyfriend.", "No disrespect intentended, but Western people should keep in mind that other cultures\u2019 have vastly different day to day customs and interactions. It\u2019s entitled to me for a Western person to assume that relationships with non-Western peole are going to play out the same. You SHOULD NOT have the same expectations going in. \n\nI say this as a Western minority female.", "Dude don't preach me about my country and for the abroad thing, I understand that. But dude should communicate the situation with his gf at least.", "Well obviously I am just shortening it, OP said in a comment they had a conversation about it which will have been much more in depth about what to expect", "Boyfriend - \u201cMy family will be in and out of our home regularly.\u201d\n\nOP - \u201cHow dare his family come in and out of our home on a regular basis!\u201d\n\nThe exact details of how it happens may or may not have been discussed due to cultural differences in expectations, but the BF seemed to be pretty upfront and honest about that aspect of his family and his apartment life. I can definitely see why the OP would expect the family to visit frequently while they were home, but the family showing up when they were away and making themselves at home would be a surprise unless the exact details of \u201cfamily in and out regularly\u201d were discussed. \n\nI would personally wager that they were mentioned since it was a big enough deal to the BF to specifically discuss it before living together, so he at least seemed acutely aware of how different that kind of family relationship is compared to US cultural norms. That said, there is not information about how specific and in-depth that discussion was available so that\u2019s just my guess based on what information actually is available. \n\nIn any event blowing up at the family member for an established norm that you never even mentioned (at least in any way the family member would know about) disliking or being uncomfortable with previously is definitely an asshole move. The sister didn\u2019t do anything wrong - that\u2019s the relationship they\u2019ve always had with their brother, and the OP had never said anything about it before blowing up and abruptly kicking the sister out.", "I'd argue that everyone who was regularly using the apartment before she entered the picture still has just as much of a right to the space now as they did before. She moved in with him, is paying a small fraction of the utilities, and doesn't have her name anywhere. \n\nIf the family members don't have gaps for weeks or months at a time between visits, they would have just as much of a legal right as she does.", "Well you see that's what's wrong with assuming.  To me that when two people are living together as a couple, it's common courtesy to expect that family members will be more respectful about dropping in unannounced and making themselves at home.  Who paid for the apartment is irrelevant, it is still her home too and she has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nThe fact that you have assumed his family paid for the apartment is just that -- an assumption.  And whether or not its true, that doesn't automatically entitled everyone in the area to just drop in.   Even if my in-laws had contributed to our home purchase (didn't happen), that wouldn't entitle them to a lifetime open door policy.\n\nThe real key here is that u/KDSD628  needs to sit down with John and tell him that what has been going on isn't working *for her*, that she needs to feel that *her home* is a safe place with a reasonable expectation of privacy.    If living with him can't be that, she needs to move out.", "Uhm sounds like you should be grateful for what his family is providing then", "Not necessarily- depends on how he described it- family over often, lots of family meals, close-knit is one thing\u2026 saying they all come and go as they please and have full access to kitchen even when he isn\u2019t home and no need to knock is a whole different level.", "He said they'd be in and out, to me that describes a bit of autonomy. For example, if I have guests staying at my place, and they said \"we'll be in and out all day,\" I'd assume they'd be coming and going as needed. I would not expect to get a message asking permission to do so. Very different from something like \"I have them over a lot,\" which implies an invitation.\n\nWould I handle this like OP's boyfriend? No. But I think he was pretty clear about it, and she should have either asked then, asked when it started, or asked now. Not yelled at his cousin.", "Nah, op knew about the arrangements.", "You know what - in Indian culture the mother is not allowed to get off the bed for 40 days after the birth. The other women of the family take care of the household chores, cooking, cleaning, taking care of the baby and the mother. It's an unfortunate girl who goes through pregnancy alone. \n\nThe only responsibility of the mother is feeding the baby. For 40 days the mother and the baby are kept from all other visitors and only after that visitors are allowed. This means the mother gets ample rest and time to recuperate. We have fewer cases of PPD, because our support system is very strong. \n\nNobody beats anyone in a corner. It's called mutual respect and living together. Yes an aunt might pass a random remark or belittle you. But you could also walk into that Aunt's house and demand that she make your favourite dish and throw a tantrum when you don't get it. \n\nWhen one cousin gets married we don't seek to upstage each other. We go - hey I've the matching earrings with that dress of yours and this purse would go better with that dress. Our culture is based on sharing not \"This is Mine\". \n\nWe grew up in a limited income family - my younger cousins and sister would be more bothered about the clothes that were bought for me, because they knew that soon those dresses would come to them. My biggest regret was not having an older cousin whose hand me downs I could wear. \n\nDoes that take away from individuality. Not at all. We are all different people, with different political ideologies, religious beliefs, marital situations, financial conditions etc. We just don't let those differences come between our relationships. \n\nI suspect other Asian (Chinese, Korean, Japanese) cultures are similar. The same could be said about Italian and Spanish families.", "I thinking living there trumps other uses.  He shouldn\u2019t have invited someone to live with him who wasn\u2019t fully aware/comfortable.  Also, inviting someone to live with you makes that space theirs too with rights accordingly.\n\nIf she just stayed there regularly no leg to stand on, but second became her primary resident as well, things change.  Should conceptually be thought of as a new space to both of them.\n\nThis is why I advise ppl to not move into an existing space if possible and pick totally new one.  Needs to be \u201cour space\u201d vs his or hers.  If that\u2019s not possible (like a bought house) need to be extra careful going through rules.  Being a permanent guest isn\u2019t healthy.\n\nUltimately they probably aren\u2019t compatible", "I\u2019m not OP.", "Oh no, OP is definitely YTA here for throwing someone out of the apartment who had just as much right to be there as OP did under the arrangements that were given.", "You clarify the first fucking day someone comes in with their own set of keys. Then you either move out or come to a solution. Not be like op and be an asshole.", "That's so strange because in sitcoms people come and go from apartments all the time. Like in Friends for example", "> As an American, \"All the Time\" does not mean that they practically live there.\n\nAs an American, that absolutely is what it meant in my home for my friends when I was a teenager. My friends were in and out almost as much as I was during the Summer. My parents were proud to have a house that we all felt was a safe space. I would sometimes wake up and find one of my friends sitting on the couch eating cereal and watching TV with my dad.\n\nJohn's way is neither how it's done for all Indians or completely foreign to the U.S.", "What makes you think she knows the actual arrangement.  Personally, I would not have moved in if that had actually been made clear.", "Idk why she would pay more than 30% when his family uses the utilities more than they do, this apartment is basically split 7 ways.", "Well, I understand your point of \"When in Rome do as the Romans do\" and while I heavily agree with this little phrase I think you're looking at it from the wrong perspective. They are in the US and OP is american but the house belongs/was bought by the indian family so yeah, in their house their rules. You can think of that as when you go to a house which is own by an asian family you'll usually take your shoes and receive slippers or smth like that. Not the best example but I think it can convey the message (house precede the country) . I don't think that OP is paying anything for the house (dividing rent and other bills) cause if so she'd probably have mentioned it. \n\n\nWhatever the case they certainly  NEED TO TALK about that and eventually reach some middle ground. I also think she should apologise to his sister.", "Because she is one American in a house full of Indians, owned by an Indian. Being the lone American doesn't 'Trump' the culture of everyone else who may have right to live in or use the house.", "She was fine with them being there frequently, not with them being there unannounced. Those are two different things and as an \u201cEnglish professor\u201d you should be able to understand this lol.", "Yes, I'm thinking the \"what they provide for us\" has a lot to do with who financed the apartment.\n\nOP also said her contribution is a third of utilities.", "Being an English professor has nothing to do with that, lol. If she doesn\u2019t like it she can leave. He owns the house, so he gets to make the rules. She isn\u2019t forced to be there, and he obviously doesn\u2019t want them to stop coming by since he approached her and said she was rude to his sister.", "Yea I had a best friend's house that I could just walk in and out of with no worries.  I'd go over there when they weren't home all the time.", "American culture is being represented the most here. \n\nThere's a majority of the people involved who have a situation that all members agree with. Then comes GF, one outsider, who inserts herself into this dynamic.\n\nThe minority stakeholder in this instance attempts to usurp the situation and is upset that her 1 vote doesn't overrule the majority.\n\nGF doesn't get extra weight on her vote by virtue of being American in America. She is one person and has one vote. They are many and vote differently. Majority wins.  \n\n\nWhat's more American than that?", "Not sure what conclusion you're reading here.\n\nIf anyone enters your house and tries to bulldoze through the existing house culture without your permission they're the asshole.\n\nNot sure why you'd think \"A person's house is their castle\" means they can't have people coming and going as they want, the whole point is that the owner is free to set the rules in their \"domain\".", "I agree, it is possible he wanted to appear as a self made man and left out that information. That's not uncommon. Not admirable though. Acknowledge the support you get to make it."]}
