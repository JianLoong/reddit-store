We live in his apartment in NYC but over the past few months since I moved in. I've noticed a weird issue. While Johns family is based in India several of his family members have shifted to NYC in the past couple of years for school, work etc. About five of them live in the city I am unsure of his specific relationship to each one but he treats them all like siblings despite an age range of 18-32 between the 5 of them with none of them being his real sibling.\n\nThe problem began when I realised his family members just show up to the apartment whenever they feel like it, they all have keys and they all come in and out throughout the week. Sometimes randomly staying the night in the guest room, coming over to watch TV or make some food even when John and I are not home etc. This was incredibly jarring for me because it felt like there was no privacy left to be within the house when all these people could just come in, borrow things, use the apartment and leave. Its not that they made a mess or broke things but it was just them using our apartment as their own. \n\nYesterday I had come and one of his younger \"sisters\" around 19  was cooking something in the Kitchen and having had a long tiring day I had just wanted to come home to a silent quiet apartment to relax in. Upset at the noise and smell I asked her why she thought she just had the random right to come into our apartment whenever she felt like it and use whatever she wanted. She didnt reply but looked extremly offended and that really irked me. I asked her to get out of the house and she did muttering things under her breath at me in hindi (a language I dont understand).\n\nThat night John came home and asked me why I had been so mean to his sister and kicked her out of the house. I said I was sick and tired of them coming over and from now they were not allowed in the house without letting us know beforehand. John said I was being a massive asshole to his family and disrespecting what they provide for us and his duty to provide for them. We havent talked since and he slept on the couch last night. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont think I was in the wrong but John is really upset so AITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689157076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xkf99/aita_for_having_an_issue_with_my_boyfriends/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to actually talk to him and together discuss what you both want. You make a new plan, You learn to live with it or you break up.", "NTA but break up with him. This issue won\u2019t be resolved and you have fundamentally different views on family boundaries. Better to walk away and find someone who isn\u2019t so enmeshed with their family.", "INFO\n\nDid John and you talked about that before moving together? Have you talked to John about this issue before?", "Info: You moved into his place. John said his family provides for him. Do they contribute to rent, groceries and utilities? Do you? Were the boundaries you mentioned ever agreed with John, or are they just yours?", "NTA, but it sounds like John has a different sense of familial obligation than you and I doubt he is going to change his mind. You may just not be compatible as a couple.", ">We live in his apartment\n\nIs it his apartment, or yours and his? Do you share the costs?\n\n>I realised his family members just show up to the apartment whenever they feel like it\n\nDid you know about this before you moved in?\n\n\n>what they provide for us\n\nWhat do they provide?", "ESH\n\nYou will not win in this situation. \n\nGet your luggage, say goodbye to him and leave in peace.", "Hate to say it but YTA\n\nYou said it yourself, you moved into HIS apartment. How much rent do you pay? Are you on the lease? That\u2019s also an improper use of the word \u201cboundary.\u201d A boundary is something that only applies to you, not everyone else. You can\u2019t set a boundary for a house that other people live in either without their approval. Correct usage would be \u201cmy boundary is people coming in and out without my knowledge or approval. If you continue to let that happen, I will move out.\u201d And you should definitely move out.", "YTA. This is something that should have been discussed between the two of you BEFORE it became an argument. John might have overlooked that initially, because it's so normalized within his family/culture. However, once you saw what was going on and realized about the keys and the comings/goings of these individuals - *you should have brought this up to John FIRST* before pouncing on a family member - who, technically, wasn't doing anything wrong. You are not wrong for wanting your space and privacy - it's just how you handled it that was AH behavior.", "YTA. You keep dodging the question as to if you discussed this. You say he told you, and that he knows you \u201clove [your] privacy\u201d, but you elaborate no further when asked. If you chose to accept him saying his family would be over, with no follow up from you, you can\u2019t now be upset he didn\u2019t magically read your mind? Sounds like you\u2019re both not suited to each other\u2019s lifestyle.\n\nEdit: a word", "YTA \n\nI truly understand not being comfortable with this. But this was apparently the situation everyone was good with except now for you when you moved in. This is something you could\u2019ve brought up to your bf and his family without being rude and mean", "YTA- this is a cultural thing and probably needed to be addressed differently. It also sounds like John pays for the apartment or his family does. It isn\u2019t that you\u2019re being culturally insensitive but that someone else is paying and you\u2019re happy about that, but upset that there are strings attached for what is largely a free place.", "You could have probably communicated it with John first and more sensitively, an important factor here may by the cultural difference too, but still NTA. It\u2019s your home after all.", "YTA for yelling at his sister who has full permission to be there previously instead of talking to your boyfriend about wanting more privacy on your apartment. Like did you ever even mention it to him before snapping at someone else? Also, didn't you realize his family came over all the time before you moved in? This might be an incompatibility issue, but you addressed it poorly.", "Were you aware of his family coming and going from his apartment before you moved in? If you\u2019d spent any time there, you surely were. Regardless, YTA. This issue was one to address with your boyfriend not his family members.", "There really should have been a discussion about personal and cultural expectations before moving in together. \n\nWhy didn't you speak to him about it when it was bothering you instead of doing nothing and then unloading on this girl?\n\nZero communication going on here. YTA", "YTA\n\nIts his apartment and you already knew this about him and his family. Why did you you think you could change him without even a conversation?\n\nYour first response of being rude to family members makes you an AH", "YTA. This is clearly a cultural difference between you and John, which is fine and doesn\u2019t make anyone an AH. You became the AH when you went straight to confrontation and kicking John\u2019s sister out without talking about it first. Different people/cultures have different boundaries about privacy and personal space. You can\u2019t expect people to respect your boundaries if you haven\u2019t communicated them. Also a bit of an AH for not actually learning the relational ties between your BF and five people who are clearly very important to him.", "Kinda either way, but its a cultural thing. there is more of them so inevitably you will be the one excluded. you have to move the goalpost for them else you wont even be on the field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni understand your frustration, but being around indian people in my life, they value family more than anything and you are gunna have to live with that", "NTA move out this will not change", "NTA to me, since like you said, he knows you value privacy, but as others have said, it\u2019s the cultural things that make you seem rude, and make them seem rude to you, maybe that\u2019s what you should discuss really", "YTA I would hate that situation too, but you are the new one in the situation. Everyone else is fine with it. Surely you knew something about the way things worked before you decided to move in. \n\nIf you were uncomfortable you should bring it up with John privately not the sister.", "YTA. It sounds like you moved into John\u2019s apartment without discussing habits or boundaries first. You should\u2019ve  discussed your issues with frequent family pop ins to John and let him address his family members if the two of you agreed on limits that would work for both. Otherwise you could decide to adapt or move out.", "NTA, but why did you not discuss this before moving in together?", "Time to jump ship. Cultural differences can cause massive issues in a relationship.", "NTA but you aren\u2019t compatible. He will Never put you or your very reasonable boundaries before his image with his family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My husbands family and friends are like this. They would raid our fridge, walk into our bedroom without knocking etc but I didn't ruin my relationship with my husband or his people.

It\u2019s for sure cultural. But omg I would be so annoyed at people just coming and going especially if it becomes an issue with certain aspects of intimacy or just being comfortable in general (taking a shower, walking to another room with a towel, etc.) Have a conversation but be prepared it may not land in your favor. Close families like that are very tight knit, after this outburst I would be surprised if a distant aunt didn\u2019t already know or his parents.", "Nahhhh, we don't do that shit in India.
