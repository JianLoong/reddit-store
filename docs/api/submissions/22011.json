Sometimes randomly staying the night in the guest room, coming over to watch TV or make some food even when John and I are not home etc. This was incredibly jarring for me because it felt like there was no privacy left to be within the house when all these people could just come in, borrow things, use the apartment and leave. Its not that they made a mess or broke things but it was just them using our apartment as their own. \n\nYesterday I had come and one of his younger \"sisters\" around 19  was cooking something in the Kitchen and having had a long tiring day I had just wanted to come home to a silent quiet apartment to relax in. Upset at the noise and smell I asked her why she thought she just had the random right to come into our apartment whenever she felt like it and use whatever she wanted. She didnt reply but looked extremly offended and that really irked me. I asked her to get out of the house and she did muttering things under her breath at me in hindi (a language I dont understand).\n\nThat night John came home and asked me why I had been so mean to his sister and kicked her out of the house. I said I was sick and tired of them coming over and from now they were not allowed in the house without letting us know beforehand. John said I was being a massive asshole to his family and disrespecting what they provide for us and his duty to provide for them.

I need to have a reasonable expectation for privacy when I am at home. To accomplish that I would like your family to call before coming over in the future. If your family continues to come over unannounced I will find a new place to live that meets my needs.\" Boundaries are about your behavior (to meet my need for privacy I will live somewhere else) to meet a need. \n\nYou made a rule, which is a unilateral decision about how others will behave, \"You will tell your family they aren't allowed here anymore.\"", "What the\u2026..???\n\nHe gave everyone in the family KEYS??

With relationships, especially where the people involved are from different cultures, you've got to have open communication about things that bother you. I'm sure they're not deliberately being rude, they've just got different ideas of what's acceptable. So don't accuse them of being rude just explain how it makes you feel, why you find it difficult to live like this and then listen to why they think this is an ok situation and work out how best to manage it so that you're both relatively happy with what's happening.

If you're now feeling differently, that's a conversation to have with John, and gives you no right to yell at his sister.", "\"Violating the boundaries of our apartment\"...\n\nWhat boundaries? YTA, girl bye", "NTA but neither is John. Based off your comments John did make you aware his family would be in and out of the house often. However, \u201coften,\u201d is subjective. Your amount of often can be one to step days a week all before noon. Where his \u201coften,\u201d basically meant they have free range.\n\nThis is a culture dispute and I feel that the both of you need to have an actual conversation with transparency. You are not used to your apartment being a revolving door and would like some space without others in it. John is use to the revolving door.

John and the cousins who are working provide for the entire family and bear the expenses jointly. The apartment is used as a base by all of them. Some are studying and so come to the apartment when they don't have classes and such. The others come over on the weekends etc when they don't have to commute to work. Basically this is a shared accommodation between all of them, with John being the primary resident.\n\nIn this scenario OP moved in and by virtue of being John's GF she assumed that she has greater rights to the place than all other roommates who have been here longer than her. This is where she's messed up. \n\nOne - John is not the sole resident. There are other roommates who share the expenses. So they have equal rights and they have lived here longer than she has. They all have their own set of keys, which means an understanding that they live there and are free yo use the place as they like.\n\nTwo - if you look into the situation from an Indian context, OP has no rights at all. A GF is NOT a SO or Wife. A live-in relationship is still tolerated at best. It has no cultural approval or acceptance. From the standpoint of the cousins, they've been generous enough allowing her to move into their living space, let alone dictating terms and asking them to leave.", "Seconded.", "His point was that India is extremely diverse and so you living means very little. \n\nIt would be like someone in Eastern Europe talking about the culture of the UK.

It\u2019s really not difficult - they just need to talk it out.", "I think what makes the difference is that she probably should have asked for clarification when he said that. \nI'd want to be clear what frequently means, as people have varying ideas about this. \nThis is definitely not something that just crept up or is in any way a surprise. \n\nThis is on OP for not getting the full details at the beginning, before she moved in. She can't claim now that the family are \"violating boundaries\" when she did nothing to set them in the first place, and actively avoided the necessary conversation after he said they'd be coming and going.", "Perhaps the perfect time to clarify would be at the time he said this, you know, BEFORE she actually moved in. \n\nEven if she was fine with it and changed her mind after (which is valid as i can see that shit getting annoying very quickly) she should have had a conversation with her boyfriend, not shouted at the sister and kicked her out.", "ESH Well then neither of you have been very open and transparent.

The FIRST time someone appeared in your home without an invite and a key in their hand is when you should have thrown them out and had a conversation not several months later.

OP I think you need to get ready to move out. He might not break up with you, but he's definitely going to ask you to leave. He literally told you this would be the situation, you said \"ok that's fine\" then kicked out his sister. And it's not even your apartment. It's his apartment.

OP needed to bring up boundaries with her BF first instead of going after the visitor.", "yeah. i think everyone trashing OP doesnt realize having people coming all the time with no notice doesnt mean the same thing as people coming over a lot with mutual agreements.", "Definitely.\nI also read that he told her this would happen before she moved in, but I'm pretty sure she had no clue about how much and how often the family would be over. \"Hey, my family has keys to the house and comes around now and then.\" Is miles away from: \"My family is around so often that you will feel like you get no private time in your own home.\"", "Yeah, that comment actually helps OP.

A live-in relationship is still tolerated at best. It has no cultural approval or acceptance.\n\nI may sound like a racist but why should the Indian part of culture matter more when OP is American and they are in the US? It's so weird to me how cultures that are more intense in some aspects claim rights to these situations. Pretty sure that OP thought she signed up for a relationship at eye level. They have obviously not communicated enough beforehand about expectations but still. None of their needs is more or less important.", "This is fascinating to read about from your perspective. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain your standpoint of the cultural norms and how they affect your family, and where OP erred in judgment as a result of a lack of cultural education (which is extremely common if OP is in NYC and I'm in South Carolina where the closest Walmart is 30 minutes away, we don't even \"get\" Indians \"out here\"). \n\nI married into a Colombian family, and it was a culture shock. They do so many strange little things in reference to how American culture \"does it,\" but none of it's inherently wrong. \n\nBut within those situations and scenarios, I see a lot of room for \"Assume makes an \"ass\" out of \"u\" and \"me\" from this post. OP assumed privacy and ownership of the shared space, as the aura surrounding a long-term non-marital relationship is way different here. \n\nThanks for being non-judgmental with those of us here asking questions about cultures here on reddit; we aren't ignorant racists (ok most of us). We're just unexposed and closed-off Americans doing what we do best; assuming individuality and expression of freedom.", "OP YTA for leaving this out of the post.", "That\u2019s where I think the cultural difference comes in. For me it is an absolute unspoken rule that my friends and family won\u2019t be getting keys to my apartment, and aren\u2019t allowed here without asking or me inviting them. It doesn\u2019t even come to mind that they might show up and let themselves in while I\u2019m out of the house.\n\nOnce it starts happening, it\u2019s absolutely on OP to ask the bf, rather than confront the guests.

It was not the sister's fault.", "There's no one American way either, though. Like India, the US is highly multicultural.

A lot of people live in multigenerational homes, stay with their parents into their adulthood, rent with siblings and cousins, etc.\n\nOP came into the situation as it stood, albeit it sounds like she never fully grasped the arrangement. She should have asked more questions since this is out of the ordinary for her. As far as living with your partner goes it's never what you initially think, and as two people living together you need to find compromise and understanding.

They can also ask her if she's comfortable with them being around so often. \n\nOP should still not have yelled and kicked her out, but she could have told her that next time she should ask permission before coming over.", "Yeah after reading more comments from OP, I think she went in for this living situation a bit naively because John sort of let her know about close contact with family at their place. I'm leaning YTA but with sympathy. She should probably apologize to his sister and sit down with him to discuss this but without too much expectations. I'm afraid this is one of the more serious incompatibility issues.", "I was quick to judge and missed the part that it was his own apartment. For me it is still a weird idea that family have more say in my living arrangement than me but he did somewhat warn her.

Because it seems you can't understand other parts of the world work differently. She's already mentioned that John has the same kind of access to anyone else from the family in the city and many other people from India have commented in this post that it is something common. The sister has a key and has permission to get in whenever she wants. When is it that you expected her to have the epiphany that she suddenly couldn't get in anymore? If OP was told about this arrangement previously, moved in anyway and then failed to readdress this with her boyfriend, the sister is not at fault for just continuing to do everything as usual.", "Well, yes.

If she was doing it before and no one said anything, they didn't have any reason to change.

But many do recognize the sister was not in the wrong and so she shouldn't be the one to bear the brunt of OP's anger. At the end of the day, the only thing AH in this entire story is kicking her out with rude comments. Every thing else is just miscommunication and should be addressed in a conversation.", "Before she moved in he already set the terms and she agreed. And you are still not addressing the problem people have with OP. His sister didn't know and wasn't told anything would change. If they have it different back with their family, there's nothing wrong with what she did. I'm sure there are others who also start dating and what not and still keep the same openness with family. Until OP takes the effort to make a change, no one should be expected to change. It may or may not be something common in their traditions."]}
