While we were away, my parents offered to water our plants, which I appreciated. \nHowever, there's a recurring issue that has been bothering me. My mom believes that family should help each other out, which I agree with, but she always asks for money whenever she helps (specifically) me with anything, even small tasks like watering the plants.  \n\nThe thing is, I never ask for money or financial assistance from them. I believe that as a family, we should support and help each other without expecting payment for every little thing. I'd rather show my appreciation through gestures like getting them souvenirs from my travels, which I did this time and other times as well.  \n\nThis particular incident turned into a disagreement when I didn't want to give them more money for gas when they go to water the plants, I have already given them more than they needed just a few weeks ago. They know I have a good income now that I've graduated and gotten a job, and they think I should automatically provide them with money in return for their help. \n\nThis situation has left me feeling like I'm being taken advantage of and that I don't genuinely appreciate their help unless I pay for it. My mom thinks I am a \"cheap asshole\" for not paying.  \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that I have an older brother who throughout the years has earned more money than me, but my parents have never asked him for money, which adds to my frustration.  \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay my parents for their help and feeling like our family should support each other without financial transactions?\n\n\n\nEDIT: After reading some of the comments, I feel like I need to clarify this: my mom offered to help, I never asked her to do this.

If you make clear to your Mom that you don't believe in giving money for family favours, she can decide herself whether she wants to continue offering help based on what she can expect from you in return.\n\nIt is a very odd situation.\n\nThe only reason I would side with your Mom is if the favour was at some expense to them i.e. their car journey to your home is covers a significant distance.", "NTA but your mom is.

I think it is only fair to ask for gas money or expenses made in case your parents are in a bad place financially, but other than that I find it weird.\n\nThat being said, the conditions of the relationship you have with your mum are different and she expects  payment. It\u00b4s sad because in a way she is rejecting the idea of what the relationship should be and her helping is then not from love but for money. I feel sorry for you, I can\u00b4t imagine how tough this is.\n\nYou\u00b4ll need to reassess your relationship with her, and perhaps come to terms that she is that kind of a person and you shouldn\u00b4t expect more than that from her.

Have you talked to him about your feelings without your mother?\n\nI agree that the you give for free and they give for money dynamic can't continue.

And if your mom is unreasonable or dominates the conversation, try with Dad first one on one.\n\nTell your parents: I've always felt like family helps each other out for free, just out of love and not for payment. You guys modeled that for me with my brother, as far as I've seen you help him out and ask for nothing in return. So I also help you out and have never asked to be paid. But when you help me out, even things you offered to do and were your idea, you ask to be paid. This makes me feel like you don't love me in the same way you do my brother. (This is where you stop to hear whatever they have to say/explanation. Is it possible they charge your brother too but you don't know as they bother him for money one on one? Or that your Dad just goes along with your Mom? Or anything? Also you can see if they have no good reply and if they care how it makes you feel.) \n\nDepending on how that goes you say: I've been feeling hurt for years, and I can't keep it up anymore. From no on, if you are going to want payment for something just don't do it for me at all. Don't offer if you want to be paid. And if I ask for something and you only want to do it for money, just tell me that's only something you'll do as a business transaction and I'll find someone outside the family. But know that I'm currently feeling hurt and used. So if you don't start showing support and help to me without being paid, I won't be showing support and help for you either. I hope we can someday be the sort of family that just cares for each other to be kind out of love, but I won't keep doing it if I don't feel like it's reciprocal.", "I know that it is a hard thing to do, but you have to come to the realisation that no matter how much you give, no matter what you do, you are never going to get that validation, love and acceptance that you seek from your mother. She sounds like a narcissist and sadly they are just not capable of it. \n\nI know from personal experience what that yearning is like. That desire to be seen, understood and loved as every child should be, it's a hole inside. I like you tried for years to be the perfect child, but in the end i had to come to the painful realisation that that love and validation i sought from my parents had to come from me, because it couldn't come from them.\n\nOnce you have accepted that things get a lot easier because then you stop begging for whatever scraps of love and attention you can get and you start to value yourself and put up boundaries. It is painful at first, but it gets easier and although there is always a sadness inside that you couldn't get what you desperately needed and wanted from them, the weighty burden of trying to get it disappears.\n\nTherapy helps! I also suggest becoming a member of r/raisedbynarcissists where you will find an abundance of people going through similar things.
