Let me start by saying that I have a somewhat complicated relationship with them, especially with my mom. She's very outspoken while my dad is more reserved.   \n\nThis summer, my partner and I celebrated our bachelor degrees with a trip to an island and various cities. While we were away, my parents offered to water our plants, which I appreciated. \nHowever, there's a recurring issue that has been bothering me. My mom believes that family should help each other out, which I agree with, but she always asks for money whenever she helps (specifically) me with anything, even small tasks like watering the plants.  \n\nThe thing is, I never ask for money or financial assistance from them. I believe that as a family, we should support and help each other without expecting payment for every little thing. I'd rather show my appreciation through gestures like getting them souvenirs from my travels, which I did this time and other times as well.  \n\nThis particular incident turned into a disagreement when I didn't want to give them more money for gas when they go to water the plants, I have already given them more than they needed just a few weeks ago. They know I have a good income now that I've graduated and gotten a job, and they think I should automatically provide them with money in return for their help. \n\nThis situation has left me feeling like I'm being taken advantage of and that I don't genuinely appreciate their help unless I pay for it. My mom thinks I am a \"cheap asshole\" for not paying.  \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that I have an older brother who throughout the years has earned more money than me, but my parents have never asked him for money, which adds to my frustration.  \n\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay my parents for their help and feeling like our family should support each other without financial transactions?", "created_utc": 1689676207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152uota/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_parents_for/", "score": 80, "replies": ["NTA\n\nStop asking for help with anything though, no matter how small. And if they ask you for help, make sure you attache a price to it.\nIf they complain, tell them to go ask your brother since they do stuff for him for free surely he'll return the favour.\n\nBut it's time to opt out of that bullshit", "NTA but I have to ask, if your Mom requesting money is a recurring issue, why do you continue to accept her help?\n\nJust say \"no thank you\".\n\nI also have to ask, why is it you can't you have a conversation with your Mom that sets out your position on this. If you make clear to your Mom that you don't believe in giving money for family favours, she can decide herself whether she wants to continue offering help based on what she can expect from you in return.\n\nIt is a very odd situation.\n\nThe only reason I would side with your Mom is if the favour was at some expense to them i.e. their car journey to your home is covers a significant distance.", "NTA but your mom is. She offered the help without the stipulation of payment then expects payment afterward. Tell her you never agreed to reimburse her bc it was your understanding that she was doing you a favor. The whole souvenir gift is very reasonable and generous. Next time if your mom offers to do something for you just say no.

Not even close.\n\nObviously the boundaries and conditions of every relationship are different, and I believe the one that you expect is a healthy and normal one. The one that your mother seems to want feels very strange and odd: it\u00b4s a transactional one whereas you have the emotional approach.\n\nIt\u00b4s family, not a job. I think it is only fair to ask for gas money or expenses made in case your parents are in a bad place financially, but other than that I find it weird.\n\nThat being said, the conditions of the relationship you have with your mum are different and she expects  payment. It\u00b4s sad because in a way she is rejecting the idea of what the relationship should be and her helping is then not from love but for money. I feel sorry for you, I can\u00b4t imagine how tough this is.\n\nYou\u00b4ll need to reassess your relationship with her, and perhaps come to terms that she is that kind of a person and you shouldn\u00b4t expect more than that from her. That is a very hard pill to swallow.\n\nI wish you the best, I wish you all the love in the world, and really.... you are not the asshole, and this really isn\u00b4t any of your wrong doing!", "No, don't pay them.
