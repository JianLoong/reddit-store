I always buy things with the intention of getting the absolute most out of them before getting something new to replace said item with. I do this with my electronics, my shoes, my clothes, and my car.\n\nFor reference, I drive a 2006 Kia Optima. It has very high mileage and does have a few dings and scratches, but aside from that, it still works fine. My relatives, friends, and co-workers usually joke about how my car does not suite me, and my wife (F44) has urged me a few times to replace it, but I've always insisted that I will once it stops working.\n\nThe issue started last week when we took my wife's (significantly newer) car to the shop to get it repaired. Because of this, my wife is no longer able to drop off our kids (F14 and M16) at school. As such, for the past week, I've been dropping off my kids and then my wife at work before driving to work myself.\n\nMy kids have been asking me to drop them off far from the main entrance of their school so they can walk the rest of the way because they don't want to be \"seen\" in this car. While I did comply the first time, I refused the next time, stating that they shouldn't put too much value into the opinions of other people. I don't think my words got through, as they will typically look around a lot, wait for fewer people to be around, and then rush towards their school building.\n\nYesterday, I picked up my wife from work (her car is still in the garage). She was standing in front of the building she works at with a few of her co-workers. I greeted them, and my wife got in. Once we started driving, she told me that I needed to get rid of my car ASAP. She told me that it was becoming too embarrassing for her (and our kids) to get in, especially when other people were around. I said something along the lines of how my car works perfectly fine mechanically and that getting something new didn't make much financial sense. She then said that she'd start taking an Uber until her car is ready if I don't replace mine. I just said that if she thinks that's best, she can proceed to do that.\n\nWe started up the conversation again over dinner and my kids agreed with their mother. I told them that I still think its premature and unnecessary AITA?\n\nEdit - For those wondering we do live in a higher income area. I work as a university professor while my wife is a lawyer\n\nUpdate - I wrote on my family's group chat that I was considering having the car painted and having its dings buffed out. My wife and daughter didn't like the idea very much (son hasn't responded yet). I spoke with my wife later on the phone and she was adamant that the car had to go. She said it was old and unsightly and made her and our daughter uncomfortable. The fact she mentioned our daughter and the comments I'm reading about teen life makes is starting to make the idea of a new car more acceptable to me\n\nEdit 2 - To saves those joining the search in the comments, my car's condition is: almost 257k miles, some dings and scratches, somewhat faded paint, interior's in good condition with a few cracks in the leather, mechanically the car's in good shape. My wife's car is 2020 Audi SQ5\n\nUpdate 2 - Spoke with my wife again after once I got home. She did reiterate that she worries that our daughter might get teased about getting dropped off in my car. She also did mention that she worries about my safety in the car especially when I drive at night with it. Lastly, she mentioned that since me and her are both minorities in a predominately white area having an old car may make people stigmatize us.", "created_utc": 1685459840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vt2fw/aita_for_embarrassing_my_wife_and_kids_with_my/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If their pride is so important to them, tell them they can cough up the money to replace your perfectly functioning vehicle.\n\n\nTell your kids that a $700+ new car payment (plus insurance increase) will significantly cut down your disposable income, and thus their allowance/activities. Ask your wife where she is willing to cut back to make the payments?  \"Put your money where your mouth is, or STFU.\"\n\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  My husband is a DDS.  He makes plenty of money. My grandfather was a millionaire in the 80s, when it meant something.  Both share the same characteristics as you do.  My husband's car is an old Toyota Solara and I have a 2015 equinox.  They are both paid for.  My husband's car is quite embarrassing...he takes pride in that.  I won't drive it, but it's His car.  Hold your ground or you will end up chasing that American Dream of living paycheck to paycheck.  Smart savers know to use something until you bury it!", "NTA. Why would you want to encourage your kids to be materialistic?  That's what Ubering them to school until their mom's car is repaired is doing.", "NTA- your wife is teaching your children a horrible mindset, and I\u2019ll just say a 2006 Kia isn\u2019t THAT old. It\u2019s stupid as shit to buy a new car when the one you have works just fine. Your wife is being judgmental and materialistic, and also passing that onto your kids", "NTA i think it's completely fine to drive it, if it's safe. I think your children and wife need to appreciate that you even have two cars. Maybe your older one should start some summer job or something to realize what it means to make and to spend money", "I'd actually tell them all to walk if they can't be seen in your cherished hooptie. NTA.", "Let em be embarrassed OP.  Hold your ground on this one until YOU actually want a new car for yourself.

A car is not a status symbol ( unless someone makes it one) nor is it an investment.  We also drive cars until the wheels are falling off.  Your wife and children sound very materialistic.  If your kids are embarassed, they can always walk where they need to go... which is it, ride in my car or walk?  Your wife she could car pool or uber ( which she's offered to do)  \n\nIn the end this would be a great time to teach your kids and reaffirm to your wife that a car is not an investment.  How long has her car been in the shop?    There is too much emphasis on what other people think,  Honestly it's very likely people don't give these things so much as a 2nd thought.", "Sooo NTA - clearly you\u2019ve done something right with your car since it\u2019s still running. \n\nSounds like their embarrassment is self inflicted. It\u2019s pretty easy to be like \u201cyeah that\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s going to drive that car into the ground\u201d and brush off anyone who would make a comment. \n\nAlso wouldn\u2019t your 16 year old be driving soon?

It's important to teach your kids to not give too much weight to the opinions of others, especially when it's about something as superficial as the car you drive. \n\nHowever, I do see where your wife and kids are coming from. Appearance and first impressions do play a role in how we're perceived, especially in the eyes of teenagers where peer pressure is more prominent. And for your wife, it may be a matter of professional appearance. \n\nDespite this, it's not reasonable for them to expect you to make a significant financial decision based on their feelings of embarrassment. A car is not just an accessory, it's an investment and a tool. If it's working fine, getting rid of it just for appearances' sake does seem unnecessary. \n\nMaybe there's a compromise to be found here. If the car needs some cosmetic touch ups, perhaps consider getting those done instead of buying a new car entirely. Or perhaps the whole family can be involved in saving towards a new vehicle, thus turning it into a teaching moment about financial responsibility and decision-making.\n\nRemember, it's not wrong to stick to your principles, but empathy for your family's feelings is also crucial. Try to have an open dialogue about why they feel the way they do, and work together to find a solution that respects everyone's feelings and perspectives. \n\nIn this conversation, you could highlight the importance of not defining self-worth or status based on material possessions, while also acknowledging their feelings of embarrassment. Try to come up with a plan that might allow you to keep the car a little longer while also addressing their concerns - maybe saving together for a newer car, or investing a small amount to improve the current one, as mentioned before.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, but a crucial conversation to have. This way, you're showing them that you're taking their feelings seriously, but also standing firm on your principles and beliefs, and using this as an opportunity to impart some important life lessons. \n\nUltimately, it's your car and your decision. The key is to handle the situation in a way that respects everyone's feelings and also sets a good example for your children.", "INFO: what type of house do you have? Electronics? Gadgets? Clothing? I need to figure out how your family became materialistic because otherwise you've had zero influence on the raising of your own kids, which seems weird. Either you've gone along with buying the nicest stuff all the time and now you're reaping the fruit of your labor, or your family somehow expects top of the line stuff even though they live modestly.

As long as it's still running well, I see no reason to replace your car. Your wife and kids need to get over it.", "NAH. \nIf they don't like it- they don't have to ride in it. \nI wouldn't force my kids to get out in front of everyone though, but that's just me.

If it functions reliably, there's no reason to replace it with a newer one.", "Definitely NTA, if they are materialistic and can't see the value then that's an issue they need to deal with.

Perhaps they'd prefer using the bus instead.", "NTA.  My parents drove their cars until it wouldn't drive anymore.  They kept their cars looking good and running well.  As long as it safely gets you from location A to location B then what is the problem?", "NTA. I think you're doing the right thing. It's only a problem if the car isn't safe. However, this seems to be about appearances and superficiality rather than anything important.", "I can't see why this would be a big deal. Does the car have mismatched doors and busted windows? I don't understand why it would be embarrassing to ride around in an older car.\n\nEDIT: NTA. If the only thing wrong with the car is that it's a little less attractive than it could be,  then it's not worth it to replace it yet IMO. Replacing the car to spare the kids the embarrassment of being seen in an older car would just be  keeping up with the joneses and reinforcing a shallow mindset. A lot of families end up with overwhelming debt and unnecessary financial hardship because they've put too much emphasis on appearances. Replace the car when it makes financial sense.", "NTA.", "NTA, your family needs some perspective about value.", "NTA \n\nSounds like you live somewhere where your wife and kids might be getting teased about being \"poor\" because you drive a beat up Kia", "NTA!

Just start looking for a new car while yours is still running - it'll take at least a month to narrow down your options and will show your family that you care about their feelings.   \n\n\nI don't think you're being an asshole nor are they being unreasonable.", "NTA  I can see from the updates you're coming around to getting a new car, just make sure you aren't bullied into getting something you'll hate for the sake of peer pressure. \n\nI'd also ask your kid's expectations about them getting cars; are they expecting you to buy them something brand new when they turn 18?", "As someone with a father who did what you did, YTA. School life can get hell without parents who can afford to avoid certain things refusing to do it.", "Far out mate this hits right at home.\n\nFamily owns a 2002 holden commodore. Bought the car in 2003 and it's been with us ever since finishing high school. Moving away for uni now and think dad is going to scrap the car.  The 2nd car we've had whilst living in Aus. Moved states with the car and drove everywhere with it. \n\nI too at first thought the car wasn't appealing when growing up. And yea in the looks department it didn't compare well to any of other nicer cars. But hell that car was reliable as, let me tell yea. Had a pretty good acceleration when needing to gap road trains. The hood of the car would raise up every single time when overtaking them. (my own muscle car I thought) \n\nsos for the back story just a young fella who appreciated their old man's car\n\nMy thoughts: If your family wanted the car gone for safety reasons or it's not good in performance then I would understand. However, if it's for aesthetics and to please others then they can learn a lesson about materialism and not to conform to peer pressure. As long as the car is reliable and in decent condition  THAT'S A WIN. Who cares if billy on the side of the street doesn't love the look of your car. Your Bank account loves you that's for sure. \n\nI would say have a discussion with the family about this issue and reiterate that having the Kia is saving you money in the long run. Furthermore, if someone is judging you on the appearance of the car then they have terrible character and you shouldn't hang around them (unless it's a BMW, then your justified. )\n\nNTA", "NTA. That said, my main concern about a car 20ish years old is that safety standards change over time, so it would be a good idea to replace it with something newer on that basis.  In case of an accident, you want the best chance possible of coming through it safely for you and your family.", "NAH, but even before I got to the edits I was wondering if any of you are minorities. I too love the ethic of using and repairing something as long as you can, but you need to consider the very unfortunate reality that this isn't just \"materialism\" in your wife and daughter. They are picking up on the fact that y'all can't afford to \"other\" yourselves any more than you already are in your community. As in, it can be literally dangerous, or have other consequences like being denied promotions and letters of recommendation, or being bullied. You've come upon the sucky reality of human society, which is that portraying that you fit in can actually be a survival necessity, in which case it is actually more \"practical\" to get a car that doesn't stand out negatively in your area.", "I'm still reeling from the fact that 2006 is nearly 20 years ago.", "Lol what in the consumerist hellscape", ">She also did mention that she worries about my safety in the car especially when I drive at night with it since me and her are both minorities\n\nNTA - Lots of people put a lot of value on appearance which normally I would ignore. Teens will be embarrassed and teased by anything and everything you do! **However, if there is a potential safety issue and you live in an area where POC (people of color) are treated less than by law enforcement or others, maybe upgrading isn't such a bad idea.**\n\nI get it. I'm a college professor and I could care less what people think about my old car (2004 Toyota) and I want to use it until the cost of repairs is more than the value of the car. But I have white privilege so if my car breaks down, I won't be hassled by police or anyone else. It totally sucks that you have to even think about your race and safety and what kind of car you drive but sadly that is a reality in some places now (especially if you live in certain states in the US).", "yeah as someone who drives an '07 Toyota (which was a big step up from my '03 ford) if I could afford to buy a newer car I'd jump at the chance. \n\njust for better economics & safety alone. idc about appearances.\n\ngiven the wife's a lawyer & OP is a professor they might even be able to buy a new car outright idk.", "In general car prices have skyrocketed during the pandemic, additionally some manufacturers removed features due to the chip shortage. If one needed a car in the past five years and had a time machine, I think that buying one before COVID would've given someone the best selection and negotiating leverage."]}
