{"id": 18557, "submission_id": "13vt2fw", "title": "AITA for embarrassing my wife and kids with my old slightly beat up car?", "selftext": "I (M44) have never really been materialistic. I always buy things with the intention of getting the absolute most out of them before getting something new to replace said item with. I do this with my electronics, my shoes, my clothes, and my car.\n\nFor reference, I drive a 2006 Kia Optima. It has very high mileage and does have a few dings and scratches, but aside from that, it still works fine. My relatives, friends, and co-workers usually joke about how my car does not suite me, and my wife (F44) has urged me a few times to replace it, but I've always insisted that I will once it stops working.\n\nThe issue started last week when we took my wife's (significantly newer) car to the shop to get it repaired. Because of this, my wife is no longer able to drop off our kids (F14 and M16) at school. As such, for the past week, I've been dropping off my kids and then my wife at work before driving to work myself.\n\nMy kids have been asking me to drop them off far from the main entrance of their school so they can walk the rest of the way because they don't want to be \"seen\" in this car. While I did comply the first time, I refused the next time, stating that they shouldn't put too much value into the opinions of other people. I don't think my words got through, as they will typically look around a lot, wait for fewer people to be around, and then rush towards their school building.\n\nYesterday, I picked up my wife from work (her car is still in the garage). She was standing in front of the building she works at with a few of her co-workers. I greeted them, and my wife got in. Once we started driving, she told me that I needed to get rid of my car ASAP. She told me that it was becoming too embarrassing for her (and our kids) to get in, especially when other people were around. I said something along the lines of how my car works perfectly fine mechanically and that getting something new didn't make much financial sense. She then said that she'd start taking an Uber until her car is ready if I don't replace mine. I just said that if she thinks that's best, she can proceed to do that.\n\nWe started up the conversation again over dinner and my kids agreed with their mother. I told them that I still think its premature and unnecessary AITA?\n\nEdit - For those wondering we do live in a higher income area. I work as a university professor while my wife is a lawyer\n\nUpdate - I wrote on my family's group chat that I was considering having the car painted and having its dings buffed out. My wife and daughter didn't like the idea very much (son hasn't responded yet). I spoke with my wife later on the phone and she was adamant that the car had to go. She said it was old and unsightly and made her and our daughter uncomfortable. The fact she mentioned our daughter and the comments I'm reading about teen life makes is starting to make the idea of a new car more acceptable to me ", "created_utc": 1685459840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vt2fw/aita_for_embarrassing_my_wife_and_kids_with_my/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A new car would come with monthly payment and higher insurance rates. I don\u2019t see the embarrassment.", "There is no car sexier than a paid-off car.\n\n\nYour wife and kids' attitude is how so many people end up in insurmountable consumer debt; they're worried about appearances. If their pride is so important to them, tell them they can cough up the money to replace your perfectly functioning vehicle.\n\n\nTell your kids that a $700+ new car payment (plus insurance increase) will significantly cut down your disposable income, and thus their allowance/activities. Ask your wife where she is willing to cut back to make the payments?  \"Put your money where your mouth is, or STFU.\"\n\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  My husband is a DDS.  He makes plenty of money. My grandfather was a millionaire in the 80s, when it meant something.  Both share the same characteristics as you do.  My husband's car is an old Toyota Solara and I have a 2015 equinox.  They are both paid for.  My husband's car is quite embarrassing...he takes pride in that.  I won't drive it, but it's His car.  Hold your ground or you will end up chasing that American Dream of living paycheck to paycheck.  Smart savers know to use something until you bury it!", "NTA. Why would you want to encourage your kids to be materialistic?  That's what Ubering them to school until their mom's car is repaired is doing.", "NTA- your wife is teaching your children a horrible mindset, and I\u2019ll just say a 2006 Kia isn\u2019t THAT old. It\u2019s stupid as shit to buy a new car when the one you have works just fine. Your wife is being judgmental and materialistic, and also passing that onto your kids", "NTA i think it's completely fine to drive it, if it's safe. I think your children and wife need to appreciate that you even have two cars. Maybe your older one should start some summer job or something to realize what it means to make and to spend money", "I'd actually tell them all to walk if they can't be seen in your cherished hooptie. NTA.", "Let em be embarrassed OP.  Hold your ground on this one until YOU actually want a new car for yourself.  Hell if you take care of it long enough give it to your kid when they're of driving age and maybe they'll appreciate having a car at all.", "NTA, hmmm speaking as someone why 18 mos ago traded in a 2007 Honda Element with 260k miles, I get it.  A car is not a status symbol ( unless someone makes it one) nor is it an investment.  We also drive cars until the wheels are falling off.  Your wife and children sound very materialistic.  If your kids are embarassed, they can always walk where they need to go... which is it, ride in my car or walk?  Your wife she could car pool or uber ( which she's offered to do)  \n\nIn the end this would be a great time to teach your kids and reaffirm to your wife that a car is not an investment.  How long has her car been in the shop?    There is too much emphasis on what other people think,  Honestly it's very likely people don't give these things so much as a 2nd thought.", "Sooo NTA - clearly you\u2019ve done something right with your car since it\u2019s still running. \n\nSounds like their embarrassment is self inflicted. It\u2019s pretty easy to be like \u201cyeah that\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s going to drive that car into the ground\u201d and brush off anyone who would make a comment. \n\nAlso wouldn\u2019t your 16 year old be driving soon? If you get a new car, what car does he think he\u2019ll be driving\u2026 I\u2019m guess the old Kia that still runs fine verse a new one!!", "NTA\n\nReplacing a car that is in good working order just because it is old/ugly would be foolish.", "NTA\n\nYour perspective on valuing function over form and not succumbing to societal pressures and materialism is commendable. It's important to teach your kids to not give too much weight to the opinions of others, especially when it's about something as superficial as the car you drive. \n\nHowever, I do see where your wife and kids are coming from. Appearance and first impressions do play a role in how we're perceived, especially in the eyes of teenagers where peer pressure is more prominent. And for your wife, it may be a matter of professional appearance. \n\nDespite this, it's not reasonable for them to expect you to make a significant financial decision based on their feelings of embarrassment. A car is not just an accessory, it's an investment and a tool. If it's working fine, getting rid of it just for appearances' sake does seem unnecessary. \n\nMaybe there's a compromise to be found here. If the car needs some cosmetic touch ups, perhaps consider getting those done instead of buying a new car entirely. Or perhaps the whole family can be involved in saving towards a new vehicle, thus turning it into a teaching moment about financial responsibility and decision-making.\n\nRemember, it's not wrong to stick to your principles, but empathy for your family's feelings is also crucial. Try to have an open dialogue about why they feel the way they do, and work together to find a solution that respects everyone's feelings and perspectives. \n\nIn this conversation, you could highlight the importance of not defining self-worth or status based on material possessions, while also acknowledging their feelings of embarrassment. Try to come up with a plan that might allow you to keep the car a little longer while also addressing their concerns - maybe saving together for a newer car, or investing a small amount to improve the current one, as mentioned before.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, but a crucial conversation to have. This way, you're showing them that you're taking their feelings seriously, but also standing firm on your principles and beliefs, and using this as an opportunity to impart some important life lessons. \n\nUltimately, it's your car and your decision. The key is to handle the situation in a way that respects everyone's feelings and also sets a good example for your children.", "INFO: what type of house do you have? Electronics? Gadgets? Clothing? I need to figure out how your family became materialistic because otherwise you've had zero influence on the raising of your own kids, which seems weird. Either you've gone along with buying the nicest stuff all the time and now you're reaping the fruit of your labor, or your family somehow expects top of the line stuff even though they live modestly. In which case you wouldn't be the A hole.", "NTA. my dad is a lawyer who spent the better part of the year driving the minivan my grandparents gifted my parents. they bought it used and needless to say it was not remotely nice. and he had other cars available he just said he didn\u2019t want to put miles on them when he had the van and that was that.", "Definitely NTA. As long as it's still running well, I see no reason to replace your car. Your wife and kids need to get over it.", "NAH. \nIf they don't like it- they don't have to ride in it. \nI wouldn't force my kids to get out in front of everyone though, but that's just me.

Oh thats so wonderful of you to buy me one!\" Is usually what i tell people. Mom's car is only a few days out of service, not really a priority to get a new vehicle.", "NTA\n\nYour wife and kids are suffering from envyitis and need to have a good lesson in what is really important in life.", "NTA.

The fact that a 2006 model car is still running is quite impressive.", "NTA\n\nYou seem to know a lot of shallow materialistic people.\n\nI share your opinion. A car is a box on wheels to move me to places I want to go. If it functions reliably, there's no reason to replace it with a newer one.", "Definitely NTA, if they are materialistic and can't see the value then that's an issue they need to deal with. Maybe worth talking to the kids about money and the value it, and items have to give them some perspective.", "NTA. Your family needs to get over themselves. Perhaps they'd prefer using the bus instead.", "NTA.  My parents drove their cars until it wouldn't drive anymore.  They kept their cars looking good and running well.  As long as it safely gets you from location A to location B then what is the problem?", "NTA. I think you're doing the right thing. It's only a problem if the car isn't safe. However, this seems to be about appearances and superficiality rather than anything important.", "I can't see why this would be a big deal. Does the car have mismatched doors and busted windows? I don't understand why it would be embarrassing to ride around in an older car.\n\nEDIT: NTA. If the only thing wrong with the car is that it's a little less attractive than it could be,  then it's not worth it to replace it yet IMO. Replacing the car to spare the kids the embarrassment of being seen in an older car would just be  keeping up with the joneses and reinforcing a shallow mindset. A lot of families end up with overwhelming debt and unnecessary financial hardship because they've put too much emphasis on appearances. Replace the car when it makes financial sense.", "NTA.", "NTA, your family needs some perspective about value.", "NTA \n\nSounds like you live somewhere where your wife and kids might be getting teased about being \"poor\" because you drive a beat up Kia", "NTA!

As much as we would all like to develop a thick skin it can be tough. As a woman in a male dominated work place myself, I can only imagine the nasty comments your wife has had to deal with about it.
