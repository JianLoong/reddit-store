The thing that resulted in a discussion was our food, or in her words, the lack of. We have pre-prepared meals for the week and we keep only stuff like ceral, fruits and snacks stored. She is used to prepare fresh meals everyday for herself and was really worried for our diet when she found out we don't cook everyday.\n\nI told her we keep in check what we eat and we take time to exercise together during the week, but she insisted that fresh meals are better so she started to make them. The thing is, she also wanted to go out, know the city, visit friends, so she started to ask my husband to cook for us. I told him it wasn't necessary, but his mother insisted and now he is cooking 3 meals for him and his mom everyday. He works from home so it's not the worst thing, but he had to stop with his hobbies like playing video games and volleyball so that he had time for his mom.\n\nI started to go out with my friends after work so that I don't have to prepare dinner for them, because I knew that if I was in the house she would ask me to. My husband asked why I'm getting home late and I told him. He wasn't happy. He said that it's unfair that I'm getting to do something I enjoy while he has to be his mom personal cheff. I told him that he could just not do it and tell his mom that he is uncomfortable with the situation, but he said I'm being an asshole to them because cooking once a day for his mom should not be that much of a problem. I still think that having to prepare an entire different meal for them after a full day of work it's not something I want to do, but now I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong here.\n\nEDIT: The wedding was two weeks ago, she arrived on Friday as the wedding was Saturday morning. She is staying with us since and she didn't gave us a date to go home, she said she would stay with us for about a month or less. And me and my husband are the ones that make the pre-prepared meals. We bought what we will need on Saturday and prepare them Sunday. We were not planning on having her over, she asked us if she could stay with us during the wedding party and we had the \"food discussion\" as soon as she arrived in our house. I still prepare my meals for the week.", "created_utc": 1695833095, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tpkdy/aita_for_coming_home_late_to_not_have_to_cook_for/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is a guest in your home and needs to respect the way you and your husband have arranged meal planning.  It's unfortunate that your husband is bowing to her demands but it is not fair of him to expect you to do the same.  Hopefully she will leave soon.  You are doing nothing wrong.", "NTa\n\n\"She can cook for herself, you can cook for her, or she can leave. I think letting her stay here for... how long after a wedding is more than courteous enough from us. I'm not cooking for her. If I don't cook for me, I'm sure as hell not doing it for someone else.\"", "NTA - his mom, his problem.  He wants to let her run your house, he can deal with the consequences.  Is he not bothered that his wife no longer wants to be at home?  Not getting to do what he wants bothers him more than his wife avoiding the house?", "NTA  - it\u2019s unreasonable to expect her hosts to change everything about their routines to suit her personal preferences. If she wants freshly-cooked meals, she\u2019s perfectly capable of making them herself. I could see making at least one home cooked meal for her a day, as she is your guest, but all 3 of them?! \n\nIf your husband doesn\u2019t want to be her personal chef, he needs to amend her expectations rather than put them on you instead. He needs to stand up to his mom rather than expecting everyone else to keep the peace by acquiescing to her unreasonable demands.", "NTA.  MIL is your guest.  There's nothing wrong with pre-prepared meals.  MIL needs to understand that she's not staying at the Hyatt.  Husband shouldn't be whining about cooking for her...  he's the one that let himself get roped into it.  How long is she staying with you?\n\nSuggestion:  Do meal prep in advance so she gets some home cooked meals that she can heat up when she's hungry.  She needs to be grateful for what she gets.", "NTA\n\nIt's rude of a house guest to come in and tell you how to do things. If home cooked meals are that important to her, why doesn't she prepare them?", "First, you do have a problem with her, she does not respect your routine, she wants the entire schedule changed to address her dietary desires not dietary needs. It is nice she helps with the house.\n\nNTA, your husband is jealous and not willing to stand up to his mom or he is okay with accommodating her. Either way it is his choice. I understand why you are staying out but that is unfair to both of you due to his mom.  How long is she staying with you. It is rude she is requiring such special accommodations. When I visit my children I will cook for them or buy food I eat and put it in their refrigerator. She and your husband are TA. It seems sweet he is willing to accommodate her but not when he is resentful you are not picking up the cooking slack for him. She needs to go home.", "INFO: how long is the visit? How long has she been there and how long is left?", "NTA\n\nTime for MiL to visit her other son!", "NTA Entirely your husband\u2019s problem to deal with. His mother is extremely discourteous.", "Your husbands mom is his problem. He doesn\u2019t *have* to prepare her three meals a day. If he wants to play video games and volleyball, then he can put on his big boy pants and have a little chat with his long time houseguest about what will and will not be happening in his own household.\n\nBy going out in the evening, you are not supporting your husband.  I bet you would be happier if the woman would go *home*, and stop disrupting your home, after all, she isn\u2019t there to visit *you*. If your husband wants her to stay, then he can deal with her.

If so, what is she eating?", "NTA. Your mother in law is expecting too much and can cook her own meals and your husband needs to stand up for himself. Cooking different meals everyday is a waste especially if she isn\u2019t eating leftovers. Food prices are getting expensive and I would let MIL know that if she wants fresh food prepared to start buying items but that\u2019s just me.", "NTA fs!!! You should not be expected to change your routine to become a personal chef for someone you\u2019re allowing to stay at your place. SHE is the one who has an issue with your diet, so she should be the one cooking if she\u2019s so worried/wants to accommodate herself. Your bf needs to either put his foot down or deal with the consequences of staying quiet. It\u2019s not your job to come home and play house wife after a long day out of the house. \n\nMaybe you guys could discuss having a conversation with her together, so he doesn\u2019t feel all alone against his mother, which can be a difficult dynamic to navigate is some cases. Either way, you\u2019re allowed to have a life and to set some boundaries with you MIL. Good luck let me know how it goes!", "The AH is your MIL, one thing is , she talks into your diet which she has no right to change. Other thing is she's the one with the problem, so why are you two supposed to cook if she's unhappy with your food; she can cook for you if she insists. And third she sees what it's done to your routine, daily life etc...that conflict starts to brew and is still on her weird mission.", "NTA. She\u2019s a guest so you want to make sure you\u2019re providing a good experience but if her plan was to have fresh meals AND go out and do stuff, she can\u2019t expect you or your husband to wait on her.", "NTA. It's his mom and him that can't say no to her.", "NTA his mother is his guest. If she is expecting meals on demand then that is on him to provide or to set her straight and offer a pre-prepared meal.  If he thinks cooking for him mom is no big deal & shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you then it shouldn\u2019t be for him either.  What is unfair is his mother\u2019s expectations and it is up to him to deal with not you. Good for you for removing yourself from this situation.\n\nIf home cooked meals are a big thing for her, she should be cooking for the two of you, especially if this is an extended stay & you are housing her.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s HIS mother, not yours. If it\u2019s no problem for her to stay with you, why does your husband think it\u2019s your job to cater to her fresh meals requirement? As a guest, she\u2019s supposed to go along with the house rules, not make up her own!", "NTA- his mom is his responsibility", "NTA and he doesn't HAVE to do anything he CHOSE to cook for himself and HIS Mother He's upset that you're not sharing the fall out of his choices.", "NTA\n\nIs it really that big of a deal to cook 1 meal a week?
