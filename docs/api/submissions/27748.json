She is used to prepare fresh meals everyday for herself and was really worried for our diet when she found out we don't cook everyday.\n\nI told her we keep in check what we eat and we take time to exercise together during the week, but she insisted that fresh meals are better so she started to make them. The thing is, she also wanted to go out, know the city, visit friends, so she started to ask my husband to cook for us. I told him it wasn't necessary, but his mother insisted and now he is cooking 3 meals for him and his mom everyday. He works from home so it's not the worst thing, but he had to stop with his hobbies like playing video games and volleyball so that he had time for his mom.\n\nI started to go out with my friends after work so that I don't have to prepare dinner for them, because I knew that if I was in the house she would ask me to. My husband asked why I'm getting home late and I told him. He wasn't happy. He said that it's unfair that I'm getting to do something I enjoy while he has to be his mom personal cheff. I told him that he could just not do it and tell his mom that he is uncomfortable with the situation, but he said I'm being an asshole to them because cooking once a day for his mom should not be that much of a problem. I still think that having to prepare an entire different meal for them after a full day of work it's not something I want to do, but now I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong here.\n\nEDIT: The wedding was two weeks ago, she arrived on Friday as the wedding was Saturday morning. She is staying with us since and she didn't gave us a date to go home, she said she would stay with us for about a month or less. And me and my husband are the ones that make the pre-prepared meals. We bought what we will need on Saturday and prepare them Sunday. We were not planning on having her over, she asked us if she could stay with us during the wedding party and we had the \"food discussion\" as soon as she arrived in our house.

He doesn\u2019t care that his wife is uncomfortable in her own home. F that!", "Even if it was BlueApron type meals, if that's what they ate, that's what she gets(barring allergies, etc).", "I adore my mother.  I also have zero desire to cook every day.  If that is something *she* wanted to do, then *she* is free to do so.  But as an adult, I do not consider it a normal thing to do something I hate \"just\" to please my mother, three times a day for a month.\n\nThe thing is - my mother would never ask me to do something I don't like every single day just because that's the way she likes to do things.  Because my mother is *not* selfish, and does not view the parent/child relationship as one where I need to jump through unpleasant hoops to please her.  We just love and respect each other.  Wild stuff.", "Happy cake day!", "Sounds like meal prepping is exactly what they do - OP clarified that they cook the prepared meals, not buy them. Mom just thinks \"leftovers\" aren't acceptable.", "I see your point. But MIL obviously lives far enough away that they don't see her often. Another reason to want to spend time with her. And so what if that time is spent doing something you may not love but mom does? OP is being asked to do this once a day, (only dinner, not all three meals), plus with her husband sharing the load. And again, it can be as quick as 20 minutes.  This isn't a big ask, for a few weeks. Not at all.\n\nAt the very least, OP needs to put on her big girl pants and discuss with her MIL like an adult. Instead she's over there going out every night to avoid the situation. \n\nI may have a different perspective b/c mine is gone and I have a hard time imagining not wanting to do anything asked if it meant spending time with her. Chalk it up to different ages/places in life.", "So\u2026 they\u2019re actually cooking? But not the way MIL wants them to cook? What the actual fuck?", "Yeah. Seems like they meal prep once a week but mom thinks every meal should be cooked right before it is eaten", "Madness. So I\u2019d come home and do what I always do, and tell MIL \u201cThis is a home-cooked meal. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like it. Perhaps the food in your own kitchen tastes better.\u201d", ">Perhaps the food in your own kitchen tastes better.\n\nYou said it. When people are guests, one of their jobs as a guest is to fit into the household as best they can. Even if you are an invited and welcomed guest, hosts are doing you a favour supplying accommodations, food, company, and all the extras. If guests do not want to do this, hotels are there for a reason. If you do not like hotels and insist the household make huge changes to accommodate you (not speaking about medical necessities or anything like that), stay home.", "Right? I applaud OP lol"]}
