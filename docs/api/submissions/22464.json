During this time I am staying with my extended family and we've been getting along really well. My cousin (f36) has been preparing to get married for about 8 months, in the country I am in the customs of marriage and dating culture are different from North America (where I'm from). During my stay I have been helping her pick out wedding dresses for photoshoots, attending photoshoots with her, as well as make the bouquets she will be using during those photoshoots. Now here is the current situation:\n\nAfter we finished with the photoshoot, which was about 6 hours long, we all went out to go eat and drink together. While some of the people we went with went out to smoke, my cousins fiance (m36) commented on how my cousin used to date people that smoked, and I remarked that it wasn't that big of a deal because she used to smoke herself. This one comment blew up more than I could possibly imagine. Apparently my cousins fiance did not know my cousin used to smoke and hates smokers as well. I then got an angry phone call from my aunt telling me that I may have just ruined their wedding and it's my fault if anything were to happen. My cousins was furious and refused to talk to me so I was unable to apologize for a while. But when I did try to apologize she said she had no interest in anything inhad to say, and told me she would do her best so she wouldn't have to come home until I leave (I leave in a week). We were also planning to go on a trip to another nearby city together as a family but she told me it's best if I don't go. \n\nEveryone here is upset at me because I divulge the fact that my cousin used to smoke, but no one seems to understand that I didn't know it was a secret in the first place. To make matters worse, my own sister (f36) who is back in my home country changed her instagram profile to say something that insinuated a threat, basically saying that she will return whatever our family gets tenfold. Whether that be treated good or bad. My aunt and my cousin both saw this and became even more infuriated, and now my cousin has forced her brother (my other cousin (m30)) and her fiance to block me on all social media platforms. I think it's important to mention that I probably became the closest with my male cousin over my trip, and now feel as though I have no family left to rely on. He also told me that he doesnt think he can drive me to the airport anymore which is 2 hours away, in fear that itll make the situation worse and his sister may become angry with him. I understand that the people involved cannot really do anything about this situation and it keeps getting worse. This situation has now spread to where my aunt and my dad are going to probably have a very serious phonecall, and depending on the conversation may go, we may go no contact with each other. I know that realistically I may not be the asshole, but I sure as hell feel like it.\n\nEdit: Just for more information my cousins fiance does not seem to be leaving her over this, and he understands that on my part it was an honest mistake. He is probably the most bothered that my cousin hid that she used to be a smoker but for now the marriage seems to be safe.", "created_utc": 1689587303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151xcut/aita_for_basically_ruining_my_familys/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For what purpose? \n\nIf you thought he already knew.... why point it out? The only reason to point it out is *because* you thought he didn't know. \n\nIf you thought he didn't know, then you knew telling him would cause conflict between him and your cousin, because he was expressing disapproval of the action. \n\nYou chose to tell on her when you didn't need to. You chose to induce conflict in her relationship. You are the asshole.", "....your family's crazy.\n\nThey're losing their shit over the fact that *she used to smoke.*\n\nUsed to=!= NOW.\n\nNTA, but you know that.

Like how were you supposed to know you just literally stepped into a minefield.", "NTA It's a cultural norm apparently you were unaware of.", "I honestly find it hard to believe that it escalated this much over her being an EX smoker, when it seems her fianc\u00e9 isn't even that bothered about it now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like this information slipping out was a catalyst for something else, but what I don't know.

Honestly once you get home I\u2019d block the lot of them and make a social media post about it. It\u2019s hypocritical to get mad at you for something that\u2019s her own damn fault and her brother is being spineless for not taking you to the airport.

My husbands friend got a new girlfriend and everyone thought we\u2019d get along famously and kind of forced us to meet.\n\nShe had asked me what his last girlfriend did for a living and I didn\u2019t think it was a secret. Well she was a stripper and the new girlfriend LOST HER SHIT- punched their bathroom mirror until it broke and I had to talk her down for over two hours.\n\nFucking crazy. Now the new girlfriend has hated me for like 10 years bc I ghosted her after that wild bat shit crazy display and says I\u2019m the bad person.\n\nYeah, ok.", "Nta, your family is being absolutely batshit over nothing", "NTA.  Another example of people looking for a scapegoat & unfortunately, you're it.", "NTA if she wasn't trying to keep secrets from her fianc\u00e9 this wouldn't be an issue. i dont understand why people decide to start off relationships with lies and then get all Pikachu faced when it comes back and bites them in the ass.", "NTA.

Don\u2019t engage with them when they are like this. Honestly, consider not being around this part of the family at all. \n\nI\u2019m glad that your sister and dad are standing up for you.

It truly took very little for them to want to punish you forever- and the wedding isn't even off.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but your family needs to butt out while you ride out the storm.  Them getting involved is just making it worse.  Your sister is throwing fuel on the fire.  Tell her to butt out.", "He's probably upset that she's been lying about herself to make a good impression more than the actual smoking, it doesn't exactly scream trustworthy.", "NTA\n\nit's not your fault your family sucks", "No. Your cousin was really wrong.

If you don't smoke anymore, why would you mention it?  What relevance can it possibly have?  How is it such a big deal?\n\nUnless she was smoking meth and/or crack and he needs to know that there's a chance she's going to go off on a week-long bender at some point, it just seems like such a pointless thing to be upset about.", "Might be he is worried she is likely to start smoking again? Health issues further down the road? Unrealistic expectations of partners? Got spooked by the \"impacts of cigarettes\" commercial with the pictures/footage of cancer victims?", "NTA.  That side of the family is not only dishonest but also psychotic.  You and your immediate family will be better off without them.  Time to head home.", "Wow. Talk about an overreaction.\n\nNTA, OP.\n\nYour family, though...they sound like a bunch of assholes.", "NTA. You made an honest mistake. Your extended family has blown it way out of proportion. Come home and let the chips fall where they may but stay well out of it.", "NTA, it was your cousin\u2019s responsibility to be open with her spouse", "NTA. If someone wants you to keep some big secret for them or to lie on their behalf, they kinda need to mention that. \n\nNot only is the cousin behaving like an ass, they\u2019re also stupid and blaming you for their own stupidity.", "It\u2019s not that she used to smoke it\u2019s that the fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t know she used to smoke.

I am someone who aggressively hates smoking, and even I think this reaction is dramatic.", "start off a relationship?\n\nI'm guessing this traditional culture likes to do arranged marriages.\n\nSo something along the line of \"I have a daughter.  non-smoker, well-educated in house-hold care.  Excellent hips, Mother had EIGHT healthy babies, sisters each have 3 so far.  We can give a X,Y, Z as a dowry.\"   s/", "Were there children with these Ex wives, just curious if he wasn't mentioning them either.\n\nBut yes, a woman deserves to know if SO has previous marriages(if for no reason other than to be sure he's legally cleared to marry again--sometimes papers don't get filed/snafus happen).", "> I also think that things were blown out of proportion \n\nThings weren't \"Blown out of proportion\" multiple people decided to decide that something meaningless was worth blowing up multiple familial relationships for.  This is seriously a non-issue unless these people are narcissists looking for ammo to emotionally control others.", "Maybe, but the hatred of people who *used to* smoke isn't completely rational in the first place."]}
