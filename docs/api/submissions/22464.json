During this time I am staying with my extended family and we've been getting along really well. My cousin (f36) has been preparing to get married for about 8 months, in the country I am in the customs of marriage and dating culture are different from North America (where I'm from). During my stay I have been helping her pick out wedding dresses for photoshoots, attending photoshoots with her, as well as make the bouquets she will be using during those photoshoots. Now here is the current situation:\n\nAfter we finished with the photoshoot, which was about 6 hours long, we all went out to go eat and drink together. While some of the people we went with went out to smoke, my cousins fiance (m36) commented on how my cousin used to date people that smoked, and I remarked that it wasn't that big of a deal because she used to smoke herself. This one comment blew up more than I could possibly imagine. Apparently my cousins fiance did not know my cousin used to smoke and hates smokers as well. I then got an angry phone call from my aunt telling me that I may have just ruined their wedding and it's my fault if anything were to happen. My cousins was furious and refused to talk to me so I was unable to apologize for a while. But when I did try to apologize she said she had no interest in anything inhad to say, and told me she would do her best so she wouldn't have to come home until I leave (I leave in a week). We were also planning to go on a trip to another nearby city together as a family but she told me it's best if I don't go. \n\nEveryone here is upset at me because I divulge the fact that my cousin used to smoke, but no one seems to understand that I didn't know it was a secret in the first place. To make matters worse, my own sister (f36) who is back in my home country changed her instagram profile to say something that insinuated a threat, basically saying that she will return whatever our family gets tenfold. Whether that be treated good or bad. My aunt and my cousin both saw this and became even more infuriated, and now my cousin has forced her brother (my other cousin (m30)) and her fiance to block me on all social media platforms. I think it's important to mention that I probably became the closest with my male cousin over my trip, and now feel as though I have no family left to rely on. He also told me that he doesnt think he can drive me to the airport anymore which is 2 hours away, in fear that itll make the situation worse and his sister may become angry with him. I understand that the people involved cannot really do anything about this situation and it keeps getting worse. This situation has now spread to where my aunt and my dad are going to probably have a very serious phonecall, and depending on the conversation may go, we may go no contact with each other. I know that realistically I may not be the asshole, but I sure as hell feel like it.\n\nEdit: Just for more information my cousins fiance does not seem to be leaving her over this, and he understands that on my part it was an honest mistake. He is probably the most bothered that my cousin hid that she used to be a smoker but for now the marriage seems to be safe.", "created_utc": 1689587303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151xcut/aita_for_basically_ruining_my_familys/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
