Your husband\u2019s friends recently admitted to you that he got cold feet before you got married and planned to escape.\n\nThat is the most fucked up thing to have to find out, and you seriously handled it like a boss. Also, *yes*, you actually can hold him accountable for it because three years is a long time for someone to hold in a secret like this.\n\nI\u2019m glad you both have a strong marriage. You sound very mentally stable, confident, and healthy. Your husband needs serious therapy. He\u2019s clearly still harboring guilt about this, and this is not your fault *ever*.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and I'm not sure what the response was they were looking for when they brought it up? Seems like a jerk thing to mention and, honestly, your husband should be mad at his buddies. However, it seems like you might have some (justified) unresolved feelings about your wedding. Some couple's  counseling might be in order.", "Uhh ... NTA. I'm fact, I'm pretty sure if my husband's friends dropped a truth nuke on me like that, I would've acted like an AH. You took it in stride. I'm sorry his feelings her hurt that you laughed. Would he have felt better if your feelings were hurt instead? I'm glad things got better between the two of you, but I hope there's no hangups. Counseling could be a good option, just in case.", "NTA. As far as I see you are doing the opposite of holding it against him, you are quite at peace with it and find it funny.", "Couples counseling. Now.", "NTA. This man made a plan to potentially abandon you at your own wedding, was so distant that you don\u2019t even remember the day fondly, and has the nerve to be devastated that you handled this conversation with grace?! Is he serious right now?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t bring it up, you just admitted that you had a suspicion that this was the case. If he wants to feel bad that you know he didn\u2019t want to marry you, that\u2019s his own problem. He\u2019s the one that married you under (then) false pretense. Crying about it doesn\u2019t make you the bad guy here, he\u2019s the one that went through with a wedding he didn\u2019t actually want (at the time).", "NTA\n\nSo, he is upset at you because him being a dick on your wedding day does not trigger a happy memory for you? \n\nI mean, what the fuck? You are the victim here, not him!", "NTA\n\nNot sure what the huge issue is really? This was 3 1/2 years ago and you're happy now. He's just upset because you found out!\n\nStop dwelling in the past.\nIts gone.\nLook to the future", "NTA\n\nPerhaps this a sign for some couples counselling or something similar. Nervousness shouldn't last for years.\n\nIf he has an anxiety disorder, it's perhaps useful to look into how he could address that. I say this as someone who does: Living with irrational anxiety about this one issue for *years* is going to eat me up inside.", "NTA. You simply acknowledged that you picked up on his vibe at the wedding. It\u2019s not like you were upset/angry or berated him for how he felt. He\u2019s just upset because he feels guilty and would rather redirect his negative feelings onto you.", "I fail to see how any of this is your fault? \n\nIm really confused.  Are you an ah for laughing and saying that?  No.  It's the truth, you both know that.  If he feels bad, that's something the two of you can discuss in coupled counseling, if you choose to. \n\nYou said he's in therapy and that's probably for the best.  It sounds like he needs it.  This is essential fo him if you decide to go to couples counseling in the future.\n\nI think the main issue here is that he didn't realize that you knew?  Or maybe didn't want to face that his feelings were obvious?  Or maybe he didn't want to acknowledge that he had hurt your feelings (your wedding not being a happy memory for you, and im guessing not for him either if he almost bailed).  \n\nDefinitely NTA, and something that can be worked out.  Just, be gentle with him.  It sounds like he is hurting right now", "NAH. It doesn't sound like you are holding it against him, at all. Has he said why he wasn't excited/had a getaway car/plan for the wedding?", "I kinda get it.\n\nYou were supposed to be devastated. In their story, you had no idea that he was worried about the wedding, and telling you would have set off an emotional landmine.\n\nInstead, what you said sounded like *I knew Seth was upset and stressed and not ready, and I ignored all that and pushed through with it all anyway*. To them, that probably sounded incredibly unempathetic and uncaring. And possibly even making light of the stress that he went through, because you laughed instead of showing empathy for his struggles. I suspect that's what your husband's friends are upset about.\n\nBut. It sounds like you're talking responsibility for your actions back then. And you've expressed that to your husband. Might just take a few days for the emotional fallout to settle so the words can sink in. Seth might need some space to just process everything.", "NAH\n\nSeems like you two need to talk and work out the underlying mental health issues before trying to make everything about how you feel right now.", "NTA.\n\nSo your husband was disengaged from the moment you got engaged, was going to do a dick move by leaving you at the alter\u2026.and you are the asshole for the way you reacted?\n\nDon\u2019t let them turn this on you. You can do therapy with your husband, BUT I recommend doing therapy just for yourself. Explore why you lack self confidence and self worth. You said you knew but did it for selfish reasons, maybe it\u2019s also how you view yourself. It\u2019s best to work on yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(January 2022)\nDARVO (an acronym for \"Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender\") is a reaction that perpetrators of wrongdoing, particularly sexual offenders, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior.[1] Some researchers indicate that it is a common manipulation strategy of psychological abusers.[2][3][4] An abuser denies the abuse ever took place, attacks the person that was abused (often the victim) for attempting to hold the abuser accountable for their actions, and claims that they are actually the victim in the situation, thus reversing what may be a reality of victim and offender.[2][4] It often involves not just \"playing the victim\" but also victim blaming.[3]", "No that\u2019s what I said pretty much.
