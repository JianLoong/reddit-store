Now as an adult, I struggle because my partner will say \"sure\" and I will, almost instinctually, follow up with \"You sure? You seem angry?\" when there was no sign of anger what so ever. It did not make my partner happy I did this. Guess what? Only \\*I\\* could change how responded to that internalized feeling. Only you're wife can do that for herself.", "NTA.

You have explained why you have stopped asking and clearly based on her shocked reaction when you proved it she heard you.

Ie \u201cthere is nothing wrong with it, where did you get the coffee\u201d , \u201cnothing wrong with the socks, where did you get them\u201d and/or have a key phrase that you agree on that calls her out when she has the negative response and gives her the chance to give a different one such \u201ctry again\u201d (important you agree on this in advance) this helps her to self correct and start changing her default responses.

If I ask my husband if he\u2019s mad at me and he says no, I\u2019ll follow it up with another question, like \u201care you stressed about X? Can I help?\u201d  He knows my first question was an instinct that I\u2019m trying to kick, and following it up with a more thoughtful question helps to alleviate him feeling accused and makes it clear that I\u2019m not feeling mistreated, but just trying to figure the situation out in my way. \n\nThe end goal, obviously, is for me to stop having that reaction. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating that I\u2019m not there, especially since it\u2019s been over a decade since I\u2019ve been in the household I grew up in and it\u2019s still affecting me. I imagine your wife feels similar, and would love nothing more than to be free of that habit and to feel secure in her sense of self.

I have had a LOT of therapy to learn how to deal with the  trauma and learn how to have healthy relationships but the one thing I still have a bad habit of doing its overexplaining myself. I had an inert need to justify how I feel, why I feel it, choices I've made and why I made them, etc...  even if no one asked I still did it because I was not granted that sort of emotional control as a child.  It became ingrained in me that my want and needs must be justified, and I was so used to having to defend myself against my own family (all also enablers who demonized me when I came forward about the abuse) and so explaining ALL my choices became a sort of survival tactic.... even if it was as simple as why I liked a particular flavor of food.

Instead of, new coffee what brand is it, say I noticed the coffee is a different brand. I like it, good choice. Or something similar.

For example, she has started a new book \"oh I've heard that book is amazing if you like it I would love to borrow it, how are you finding it? She makes a new recipe you like \"omg this is delicious this must have taken so long, thank you so much! Did you save the recipe? We should try it together. Was it easy?\", etc etc. If this doesn't work, sometimes my friend has those days too, I started asking how she feels about things, for example \"This coffee is amazing, have you tried?/how did you like it?\". \n\nOtherwise, try to talk to her about this and find a way to make sure this doesn't impact anyone negatively. For example, in the beginning me and my friends had a \"word\" we used when somethings was bad, my friend got used to it and now doesn't question if our questions are critiques, along side of the compliment thing. Her therapist also said we could remind her nothings is wrong in the beginning and several other copping mechanism to try to find her personal one.

(\"What's wrong with it, what have I done wrong?\") I see how that must be frustrating for you.\n\nAt the same time I have a particular insight to your wife's behaviour and reactions because I also grew up in the same kind of situation she did. She isn't responding to you with negativity. The years of conditioning to expect every conversation to contain criticism and berating - during some of the most important formative years - mean that she's hearing **you** begin the conversation with negativity. If you are pointing something out it must be because you have a problem with it. She's not entering the conversation with negativity, she's making an attempt to **defend** herself, to stand up for herself. And that probably doesn't feel good for you because you had no intent to imply any fault, but it is actually progress - chances are she was never able to do that for herself when interacting with her father. \n\nI really, strongly recommend trying to find a counsellor that can help your wife individually as well as work with you together, so that you can both learn to understand the reasons why these behaviours happen. Then you are able to better consider how you respond to each other to build a more healthy dynamic. My husband came to just a few sessions with me but it was so, so valuable in providing an opportunity to me to explain what went on in my mind during a situation like the ones you've described and him understanding that it wasn't because of anything he did that I responded the way I did,it was simply the reality I lived with for most of my life. \n\nIt's still my instinct to assume criticism sometimes but I have learned to slow down a bit and think about his tone, his body language, context etc and reassure myself that it wasn't a jab, it was simply an observation. Or if I am unsure I now know that he will understand if I need to ask for clarification.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole but I do think that you have chosen the wrong approach here - not through any fault of your own but because it's just a hugely emotional, complex shitshow of a situation to try to figure out. You do seem to care deeply for your wife, and that's why I made the counselling suggestion. It's not the kind of trauma people just know how to instinctively heal, it needs the help of a professional. I wish you all the best.", "YTA\n\nShe's dealing with abuse.

Once, while dating, my boyfriend (now husband) said towards the end of a call \"Don't worry about it.\" This triggered me in a HUGE way--I called/texted him probably 40 times in like 2 hours because I was convinced something awful was going on, he hated me, he was breaking up with me etc. When he called back, after making sure I wasn't, you know dying, he asked me what the heck was going on. And I said \"You can't ever say \"don't worry about it.\" I  will panic and freak out\" Quite understandably, he asked me what on earth he was supposed to say when it really was nothing to worry about. I said I don't know, but it can't be that. He came up with the idea of finding a phrase that was so clearly comically untrue, it would make me laugh and would mean (to us) don't worry about it. The phrase was (him) saying \"I'm pregnant\". Which for some reason cracked me up, and for years was what he said. At a certain point, he stopped needing to, (just happened organically) but we still sometimes use it.  \n\n\nPoint is: Trauma is awful. Being the partner of someone working through trauma (I'm sure) sucks. But you gotta come up with ways to rewire the brain together. And therapy. (Assuming she'll go). My sincerest best wishes to you both.", "Had this same problem with my partner. For example, I was eating something they made and said, \u201coooh, spicy! What\u2019s in it?\u201d I really like it and was excited about the unexpected spice of the dish. They threw it out before I could take a second bite, apologized, and started making something else. I still had my fork in my hand as it was going into the trash, I was so confused. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you say, or how you say it, it\u2019s taken as critical. It\u2019s exhausting to have to think about everything you say like that. Praise twisted into criticism leaves you boxed into a corner with no good options. Especially when you love your partner and don\u2019t want to accidentally/unintentionally hurt them. On the bright side, therapy helped a lot! Highly recommend finding a good therapist that will guide you through this. It takes time and effort, but it can change! I can now talk to my partner openly about anything.

And definitely talk to her about possibly getting professional help together.\n\nFor instance, if I notice something that seems to cause repeated negative thoughts for myself or my partner, I\u2019ll say \u201chey, I really enjoy this thing and appreciate the thought and care put into it- I feel like there might be some anxiety in how its perceived or how we do X\u2014- this is how I feel when it happens to me, because xyz is where I\u2019m coming from.

She\u2019s constantly waiting for the other show to drop and the criticizing to begin. I hate that for her and, as everyone else has mentioned, therapy is the way forward.", "The thing that OP already said doesn't work?", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s job, but he is her spouse and they live together. Him helping in anyway he can benefits both of them", "These \"reflexes\" are so real. I apologize for everything (baby: cries. Me: apologise to husband because we were just drifting to sleep) because I'm hoping to smooth over a potential tantrum from my mother, and also a bit to commiserate. My husband's answer to ANYONE asking him \"how is this food\" is \"delicious\". If I want to know whether to add the sunflower seeds next time, I literally have to ask him twice - \"how do you like the sunflower seeds?\" \"delicious\" \"okay but should I add them next time?\" \"eh, nah, I prefer without\".", "> By prefacing the question with enthusiasm, he can easily get ahead of his wife's tendency for self-doubt.\n\nThat was my first instinct to suggest as well, but OP said he tried it and it never worked.  No matter how he set questions up to frame them in a positive way, they still triggered that anxious response.", "I\u2019d love for OP to provide a full transcript of one of these conversations, including what he says, not just her reaction."]}
