Now as an adult, I struggle because my partner will say \"sure\" and I will, almost instinctually, follow up with \"You sure? You seem angry?\" when there was no sign of anger what so ever. It did not make my partner happy I did this. Guess what? Only \\*I\\* could change how responded to that internalized feeling. Only you're wife can do that for herself.", "NTA.

You have explained why you have stopped asking and clearly based on her shocked reaction when you proved it she heard you.

Ie \u201cthere is nothing wrong with it, where did you get the coffee\u201d , \u201cnothing wrong with the socks, where did you get them\u201d and/or have a key phrase that you agree on that calls her out when she has the negative response and gives her the chance to give a different one such \u201ctry again\u201d (important you agree on this in advance) this helps her to self correct and start changing her default responses.

If I ask my husband if he\u2019s mad at me and he says no, I\u2019ll follow it up with another question, like \u201care you stressed about X? Can I help?\u201d  He knows my first question was an instinct that I\u2019m trying to kick, and following it up with a more thoughtful question helps to alleviate him feeling accused and makes it clear that I\u2019m not feeling mistreated, but just trying to figure the situation out in my way. \n\nThe end goal, obviously, is for me to stop having that reaction. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating that I\u2019m not there, especially since it\u2019s been over a decade since I\u2019ve been in the household I grew up in and it\u2019s still affecting me. I imagine your wife feels similar, and would love nothing more than to be free of that habit and to feel secure in her sense of self.

I highly recommend counseling for you both and individually for her. I know it did wonders for me. \n\nI had an abusive, drunk father. I have had a LOT of therapy to learn how to deal with the  trauma and learn how to have healthy relationships but the one thing I still have a bad habit of doing its overexplaining myself. I had an inert need to justify how I feel, why I feel it, choices I've made and why I made them, etc...  even if no one asked I still did it because I was not granted that sort of emotional control as a child.  It became ingrained in me that my want and needs must be justified, and I was so used to having to defend myself against my own family (all also enablers who demonized me when I came forward about the abuse) and so explaining ALL my choices became a sort of survival tactic.... even if it was as simple as why I liked a particular flavor of food.

Instead of, new coffee what brand is it, say I noticed the coffee is a different brand. I like it, good choice. Or something similar.

For example, she has started a new book \"oh I've heard that book is amazing if you like it I would love to borrow it, how are you finding it? She makes a new recipe you like \"omg this is delicious this must have taken so long, thank you so much! Did you save the recipe? We should try it together. Was it easy?\", etc etc. If this doesn't work, sometimes my friend has those days too, I started asking how she feels about things, for example \"This coffee is amazing, have you tried?/how did you like it?\". \n\nOtherwise, try to talk to her about this and find a way to make sure this doesn't impact anyone negatively. For example, in the beginning me and my friends had a \"word\" we used when somethings was bad, my friend got used to it and now doesn't question if our questions are critiques, along side of the compliment thing. Her therapist also said we could remind her nothings is wrong in the beginning and several other copping mechanism to try to find her personal one.
