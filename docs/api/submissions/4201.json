Now as an adult, I struggle because my partner will say \"sure\" and I will, almost instinctually, follow up with \"You sure? You seem angry?\" when there was no sign of anger what so ever. It did not make my partner happy I did this. Guess what? Only \\*I\\* could change how responded to that internalized feeling. Only you're wife can do that for herself.", "NTA.

You have explained why you have stopped asking and clearly based on her shocked reaction when you proved it she heard you.

Ie \u201cthere is nothing wrong with it, where did you get the coffee\u201d , \u201cnothing wrong with the socks, where did you get them\u201d and/or have a key phrase that you agree on that calls her out when she has the negative response and gives her the chance to give a different one such \u201ctry again\u201d (important you agree on this in advance) this helps her to self correct and start changing her default responses.

If I ask my husband if he\u2019s mad at me and he says no, I\u2019ll follow it up with another question, like \u201care you stressed about X? Can I help?\u201d  He knows my first question was an instinct that I\u2019m trying to kick, and following it up with a more thoughtful question helps to alleviate him feeling accused and makes it clear that I\u2019m not feeling mistreated, but just trying to figure the situation out in my way. \n\nThe end goal, obviously, is for me to stop having that reaction. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating that I\u2019m not there, especially since it\u2019s been over a decade since I\u2019ve been in the household I grew up in and it\u2019s still affecting me.

I have had a LOT of therapy to learn how to deal with the  trauma and learn how to have healthy relationships but the one thing I still have a bad habit of doing its overexplaining myself. I had an inert need to justify how I feel, why I feel it, choices I've made and why I made them, etc...  even if no one asked I still did it because I was not granted that sort of emotional control as a child.  It became ingrained in me that my want and needs must be justified, and I was so used to having to defend myself against my own family (all also enablers who demonized me when I came forward about the abuse) and so explaining ALL my choices became a sort of survival tactic.... even if it was as simple as why I liked a particular flavor of food.

Instead of, new coffee what brand is it, say I noticed the coffee is a different brand. I like it, good choice. Or something similar.

For example, she has started a new book \"oh I've heard that book is amazing if you like it I would love to borrow it, how are you finding it? She makes a new recipe you like \"omg this is delicious this must have taken so long, thank you so much! Did you save the recipe? We should try it together. Was it easy?\", etc etc. If this doesn't work, sometimes my friend has those days too, I started asking how she feels about things, for example \"This coffee is amazing, have you tried?/how did you like it?\". \n\nOtherwise, try to talk to her about this and find a way to make sure this doesn't impact anyone negatively. For example, in the beginning me and my friends had a \"word\" we used when somethings was bad, my friend got used to it and now doesn't question if our questions are critiques, along side of the compliment thing. Her therapist also said we could remind her nothings is wrong in the beginning and several other copping mechanism to try to find her personal one.

(\"What's wrong with it, what have I done wrong?\") I see how that must be frustrating for you.\n\nAt the same time I have a particular insight to your wife's behaviour and reactions because I also grew up in the same kind of situation she did. She isn't responding to you with negativity. The years of conditioning to expect every conversation to contain criticism and berating - during some of the most important formative years - mean that she's hearing **you** begin the conversation with negativity. If you are pointing something out it must be because you have a problem with it. She's not entering the conversation with negativity, she's making an attempt to **defend** herself, to stand up for herself. And that probably doesn't feel good for you because you had no intent to imply any fault, but it is actually progress - chances are she was never able to do that for herself when interacting with her father. \n\nI really, strongly recommend trying to find a counsellor that can help your wife individually as well as work with you together, so that you can both learn to understand the reasons why these behaviours happen. Then you are able to better consider how you respond to each other to build a more healthy dynamic. My husband came to just a few sessions with me but it was so, so valuable in providing an opportunity to me to explain what went on in my mind during a situation like the ones you've described and him understanding that it wasn't because of anything he did that I responded the way I did,it was simply the reality I lived with for most of my life. \n\nIt's still my instinct to assume criticism sometimes but I have learned to slow down a bit and think about his tone, his body language, context etc and reassure myself that it wasn't a jab, it was simply an observation. Or if I am unsure I now know that he will understand if I need to ask for clarification.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole but I do think that you have chosen the wrong approach here - not through any fault of your own but because it's just a hugely emotional, complex shitshow of a situation to try to figure out. You do seem to care deeply for your wife, and that's why I made the counselling suggestion. It's not the kind of trauma people just know how to instinctively heal, it needs the help of a professional. I wish you all the best.", "YTA\n\nShe's dealing with abuse. Instead of refusing to engage, try to help her realize when it's happening and explain that there's nothing wrong with her or the things she does. You care for her and were just interested in something she had done or made. Eventually, with enough persistence, maybe it would stop being second nature. If you just stop asking, the insecurity doesn't go away. You just don't hear it anymore.", "My brother in Christ is it that hard to preface a question with a compliment?\n\n\"These socks are the best socks I've ever worn, where did you get them?\"\n\n\"This pho is delicious, where'd you find the recipe?\" \n\nGeez Louise bro use your brain\n\n\nYTA", "NTA but dude, c'mon. instead of asking \"where did you get that\" maybe try \"this is wonderful, where did you get that?\". Preface every question with your positive feeling about whatever it is and then ask your question.  \n\nWow, these socks are so soft and comfortable, where did you get them?\n\nThis coffee is delicious, so complex with notes of vanilla and cedar, where did you find it??\n\nHoney, this PHO is delicious, you made this from Scratch?? Amazing. \n\nLift her up by using the positive words that are flitting thru your brain before asking a question.", "NAH and perhaps therapy might be in order. That said, how about prefacing each \"question\" with a positive statement such as \"This new coffee is great! I absolutely love it! How did you find it?\"", "NAH. You seem like you are trying to be kind to your wife. She has been conditioned by years of abuse from her father. She does need therapy though. But until that happens, maybe preface your questions. For example: \"This coffee is delicious. Where did you get it? Good choice.\"", "NAH but try to add a little kindness & reassurance into your communication w your wife. Address that you\u2019re aware that she\u2019s been belittled her whole life & that her negative responses are a trained response: but also tell her that you don\u2019t want to/aren\u2019t belittling her, that you want to validate & love her. Then do that. Insert positivity & love into the conversation whenever she responds like that. Make eye contact, give her a hug (if she accepts love like that) & you\u2019ll be surprised at how far that can go to help this situation. Also, therapy would greatly benefit of course her but I think the both of you even. Good luck.", "He does it it doesn\u2019t work.", "He already says that.", "I sometimes redirect our foster kids. So let her say \"why what's wrong with it\" and then say to her, \"I think you meant to say I picked it up at the farmer's market, what do you think of it?\"\n\nI'm not sure how well it works with adults, but the kids need examples of better things to say. And so I redirect A LOT.  My most common refrain is \"I think you meant to say thank you\".\n\nNo, I don't say any of this sarcastically. They are CHILDREN, I am patient with them.  They need consistency and \ud83d\udc95", "Why don't you phrase future questions like \"hey babe, I really like the new (insert generic item description here), what brand did you buy this time?\" this way it can *hopefully* trick her brain into not recognizing your questions as an attack on her efforts causing her to ask defensive questions.", "Ok, I do think YTA a little here. If she was a chronic nail biter or a smoker or had another compulsive habit, would you expect her to be able to stop that as soon as you said it bothered you? I doubt it. Especially as you recognize this habit of hers is a survival mechanism to be able to live with her horrible father. I hope you see that it seems like you are the asshole when you say 'I want you to stop your survival mechanism because it is negative.' Be gentle, ask her if it is ok if you remind her when she does it. When she does, remind her that you love her and she doesn't have to be perfect.

Is that the reaction you want to go with here?\n\nAs many others have said, it sounds like she would greatly benefit from therapy. \n\nBut she ALSO needs you to hold a (lovely, gentle, kind) mirror up to her in the moment.", "And is it that hard to just stop talking about your partner and themselves 100% over sitting them down and having a more mature conversation instead of them having to ask?", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s envisioning her dad here, I think it\u2019s much more subtle and reflexive. Think of how a person grows up with a physically abusive parent, and as an adult involuntarily flinches at sudden movements threatening or not.\n\nYour wife was raised in a psychologically and verbally abusive household. I think you both recognize that. I am sorry that therapy was unsuccessful for her, and I hope she\u2019ll try again.  I suggest that you do couples therapy for communication purposes, she may be able to move on to individual therapy from there.

Could not recommend it enough. But the caveat is that the person needs to want to improve and be better to learn and understand themselves and how they interact and react with the world.", "What?", "This makes no sense", "Yess I completely agree. I feel like I worded it wrongly. What I meant with envisioning her dad is that she is not actually aware of the situation at hand to recognize that the intentions for the questions are not malicious. It's like she is reacting based on the type of person her dad is rather than the type of person her husband is, the awareness  is not there.\n\nYes you are right it is subtle, her response is not as conscious", "Agreed, NAH. I grew up in a physical and mentally abusive home and I learned how to apologize for everything, even if it wasn\u2019t my fault, because it seemed to quell some of the issues sometimes if I just took on the fault. My bf knows this and while I\u2019m working on not apologizing now unless it is actually my fault, he recently told me \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, you don\u2019t have to apologize for things that aren\u2019t your fault\u201d and while it obviously didn\u2019t fix everything overnight, it\u2019s nice to know that he\u2019s on my side. I guess the point of all of this was patience and therapy. Continue to tell her she\u2019s amazing and what she gets you is amazing and that, coupled with therapy, should help tremendously. Also, I\u2019m so glad she has someone so supportive in her life as that doesn\u2019t always end up being the case.", "Sit down with your partner and tell them that your questions aren\u2019t bad and that it is hurting you when they ask whats wrong with it.
