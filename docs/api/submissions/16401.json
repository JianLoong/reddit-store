You asked for an accommodation for your disability. The priest granted it. It's ok for her to be disappointed that the mass didn't include a traditional feature. But, on hearing the priest explain, she should have accepted the reason. What she shouldn't have done is confronted you for your disability. Once she persisted in that, you were justified in pointing out the hypocrisy of selfishly ignoring the needs of others while in church. As it says somewhere in Leviticus: \"Attack ye not those with disabilities lest thou shalt be called out upon it and endeth up butt hurt.\"", "How dare you want to practice your faith while being able to do silly things like breathing! \n\nNTA, and it was really kind of your pastor to do that!", "NTA\n\n> She questioned me on why I felt the whole Church needed to change to fit my \u201cpreferences.\u201d\n\n\"God prefers His adherents don't suffocate while in the practice of worship.\"", "BIG NTA.  Your Priest threw you under the bus.   \n\n\nYou were not harsh enough if you ask me, but then again it is people like that lady why I no longer am a Catholic.  :)", "NTA - If incense is the basis for her faith, she has some hard thinking to do.  If it truly was your \"preference\" there might (and I say might) be some wiggle room here, but having a health concern that you expressed to your priest who then did the right thing and accommodated your concern is clearly not a matter of \"preferences\".", "NTA. I'm not very religious but I'm quite sure exposing hypocrites makes Jesus love you.\n\nI merely feel it's weird that the pastor singled you out, but maybe that's because I imagine that lady already in attack mode in my head when she talked to him.", "NTA - Incense is a part of the religion, but your faith doesn\u2019t hinge on it. Neither should hers. Celebrating Easter Mass is not dependent on whether or not one burns incense \u2014 and the God who loves the *heart* of worship more than the instruments or elements used will not care about incense one way or another. Worship in spirit and truth, that\u2019s what matters.\n\nShe was judgmental. Hope she reflects on her words and actions.", "NTA \n\nI think less that you questioned her faith and more that you pointed out her hypocrisy. \n\nThis is an attitude in many churches that irritates me. The belief that tradition is more important that reaching the people with the word of God is ridiculous. It is understandable that incense is an engrained and very important part of many of these ceremonies but this church did not deprive it's congregation of it completely by doing one of the slower services in an inclusive way. \n\nFurthermore, this woman is completely in the wrong for barring you for your health condition when it was the pastor that agreed to accommodate you in the first place. You did not force the church to do it. You asked politely and like a good shepherd your pastor saw to in that left behind sheep were accommodated.  \nShame on this woman.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone is TA it's her. An awful lot of self-identified Christians do not bother trying to live up to what their chosen God is said to have preached.", "Can't really descide, in the one hand yes why do you question her beliefes just because she was disappointed about what happened, thats kind of an AH move. The lady also has no right to talk to you like that she can be disappointed but no need to make a big thing out of it.", "NTA.\n\nShe didn\u2019t need to get so pissy about it.\n\nThen again, I\u2019m not a huge fan of the incense. I was with family at a cathedral for Epiphany, and I put my KN95 back on because the incense was so thick and really irritated my throat.\n\nI don\u2019t know if your parish has a separate cry room, but you might look into that for the masses with incense.\n\nOut of idle curiosity, was this a Tridentine rite mass?", "NTA\n\nI love incense, but other people, like you, have health difficulties with it, and a third group of people just don't like it. Fortunately, as you managed to achieve, everyone can be accommodated by having multiple services, some with and some without incense.\n\nBut it sounds like your priest dropped the ball here. It's great that your church selected one Mass to be incense-free, but the church ought to advertise the fact, so that people who want no incense know when to come, and people who do want incense know when not to come. Seems like they didn't do that, so I'll extend a mild rebuke to Father Asshole.", "NTA", "NAH I don't think  either person's behavior qualifies as assholeness.  Just a minor disagreement.  She was disappointed and insensitive.  Many people can't comprehend that chemical sensitivities are a real thing so she may have legitimately seen your request as a 'preference'.  Your preachy response was out of line, IMO but not quite asshole level.", "Being able to breathe is a preference?! NTA\u2026..", "NTA for asking. If it would have truly been a big deal in terms of impacting the legitimacy of the service, the pastor could have said no. \n\nHonestly, the only AH is the pastor who threw you under the bus. There\u2019s no reason anyone had to know that you were the one who asked for the accommodations.", "NTA Would have to be a fairly lousy priest to not try and accommodate all people for something that isn't needed at mass(BTW are Catholic priests in America referred to as pastors? I'm from Ireland and just curious)", "NTA, and the incense bothers me, too (I don't have asthma, but it makes me cough and sneeze so I know that's not as severe, but still). I get that it is important to the ritual but I think it's more than reasonable to offer an incense-free mass at a non-peak time. After all, Mass should be inclusive, right?", "YTA\n\nI'm all for reasonable accommodation, and I like your pastor's solution. However, while I'm not catholic it is my understanding that that particular religious tradition is rather heavily laden with ritual and symbolism, so it would make sense to me that seeing those traditions modified could have a big impact on someone who is practicing their faith that way.\n\nAside from the religious practice aspect, modifying an experience where smells/other sensory inputs are critical could certainly challenge someone's expectations. To secularize that, if someone were to say visit a rose garden, and come to find that the gardeners had done something to suppress the scent of roses; or if say someone went to grandma's house on thanksgiving and found the familiar smell of cookies to be absent; obviously the lack of that sensory input would be a disappointment and detract from the experience. All this is to say that the woman's disappointment is reasonable. It makes sense to me that, to her, it wasn't a \"real, traditional Easter Mass\" in the same way that that grandma's house example above might be perceived as not a 'real, traditional thanksgiving' experience because a fundamental component was absent.\n\nThat being said, she never should have approached you, that was rude on her part and your pastor's effort to be be inclusive should be applauded. She was on the rude side, but not so far that I would call her an AH. However, by comparison you went way to the extreme by questioning her faith, which is a direct challenge to a core part of her identity. You were way to harsh in this instance.", "Take this to confession.", "ESH - Why I can't say because I'll get banned apparently.", "NTA. I was a cradle Catholic, and incense isn\u2019t absolutely necessary for mass. It\u2019s no less of a mass without incense. And she should have more compassion for her fellow human. Jesus said to love each other like he loves you. (I can\u2019t completely remember, but isn\u2019t that said during mass?)", "YTA. That woman is a hypocrite. But given all the sex abuse in the Catholic Church, how they treat women, and how they treat gay people, it\u2019s not a surprise or an aberration. You thought the leopard wouldn\u2019t eat your face, but here you are.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My church does this every Easter and Christmas. The late service has incense, the early service does not. It\u2019s sent out in the email updates leading up to the holiday, posted on the church\u2019s website and social media pages, printed in the weekly announcement bulletin, and announced out loud from the pulpit for three or four weeks in advance. That way, people who want incense can go to the incense service and people who don\u2019t want incense can go to the one without. \n\n2) HE TOLD ANOTHER PARISHIONER ABOUT OP\u2019S DISABILITY WITHOUT MAKING SURE SHE WAS OKAY WITH IT. \n\nChurches have been having issues with disability accommodations since just about forever, so I\u2019m not shocked that he did it.

And your response really misses the mark.  \"where smells/other sensory inputs are critical\"  lol.  There is nothing critical or irreplaceable about the incense.
