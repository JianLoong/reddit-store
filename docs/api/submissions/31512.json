Obviously, after the separation we didn't stay in touch.\n\nFast forward to two months ago, I found out he was arrested for abusing his second wife (now divorced) and while in prison, he got into a fight with other inmates and was very badly beaten up. He is going to be released from prison in a week and has no other living family in our state so he gave my number as the emergency contact (I have no idea why he thought I'd be up for this).\n\nAnyways now my kids found out about this too and the older kids (19 and 23) are totally against helping him but my daughter (14) is practically begging me to bring him home. She says that he's her father and the history we have with each other should not be a hindrance in their relationship as father and daughter. She wants me to bring him home and says that she'll take care of him until he recovers from the injuries. \n\nI refused but she is adamant, she's calling me insensitive and an asshole.", "created_utc": 1700671098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181dg31/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_ex_husband_stay_in_my/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m so sorry that your daughter is being hurt by this situation but keeping a violent abuser as far a At as possible, physically and emotionally, is absolutely the best call for you and your children.  I hope in time your daughter comes to understand why you had to do what you are doing, it\u2019s not her fault and he has likely manipulated her to see you as the bad guy, but whatever happens you are 100% right to protect your family in the way you are doing.", "NTA. He's getting out of prison for beating up his second wife.

Do not budge on this. He was in jail because he hasn't changed.", "Nta. Do not allow that man in YOUR house. I am sure there are housing options available to him. Either a social worker or his PO can assist with that, that\u2019s their job not yours.", "NTA\nHe's a dangerous man and your 14 year old doesn't understand this.

She can think whatever but you never invite your abuser into your house!", "NTA. It\u2019s your house and you 100% have the right to say no to someone staying there, especially an abusive ex partner. \n\nIt seems pretty nuanced, but if there\u2019s a safe way for your daughter to have a relationship with her father outside the house, or even via phone calls or letters, that might be something you can suggest, and it\u2019d be a way to show her your decision is NOT about preventing their relationship.", "100% NTA\n\nYou are doing what needs to be done to protect you and your family. He made his own bed, now let him sleep in it.  He has to realize what the cause is.", "NTA. You are the adult. Your 14 year old daughter has no clue what it\u2019s like living with a serial abuser.

He obviously has psychological problems. Who\u2019s to say he wouldn\u2019t start abusing you again and your daughter? I would not let him move in. I would not let him stay even one night.

Tell her that you will not be a hindrance to her relationship, but equally you have a right to be safe in your home and you have a responsibility to make sure she is too. Explain that your home is also a safe place for your other children and that it is not appropriate for the safe space for 4 people to be put at risk for an adult man who has the ability to sort himself out. Tell him that you and she can help with things like looking at charities and rehabilitation help, that way if he doesn\u2019t help himself it\u2019s on him, not you. I fear she is going to be sadly let down.", "NTA, you have come so far from that relationship to be dragged back into it again. It will be a difficult time with your daughter but he had his chance, ruined a second and third chance, she will eventually understand when she is older and has some experience", "NTA - your daughter doesn't remember how horrible it was to live with him.  Have her older siblings tell her what an abusive asshole he is, and it isn't safe for either of them to have him in the home. She is more inclined to listen to them than you.", "NTA.

Ignore her ignorance and keep in keeping on. NTA.", "NTA at all. As another commenter said, your daughter may be too young to understand. \n\nAlso the fact that your ex hasn\u2019t changed at all. He is still violent and abusive", "NTA.  Your daughter was too young to really remember the harm he caused, so I understand where she's coming from.

You should be even more stubborn than your daughter in this.", "NTA, and I agree with the others.  Your children are old enough to know the truth.  Tell them.  If you have pictures, show them.", "NTA- She was 2 when you separated. She most likely doesn\u2019t realize what kind of person he is. If your daughter insists you help him out, find a half-way house situation for him and let her visit. It might be painful, but she can at least spend time with him and find out what kind of person he is.", "Absolutely NTA.  He left when she was two.  She doesn't know what she's volunteering you and  herself for.   You've told her no...she can try being adamant all she wants.  Time to just blandly repeat No.", "NTA\n\nNo ma\u2019am, let him figure out this mess on his own.", "NTA. You are the adult. She is a child.
