Problem solved!! \nNTA\n\nI serious cant understand this people - who are literally on the verge of being homeless - that think they can make demands on other people houses!! The dogs wouldnt even be homeless! \n\nYour cat is a priority for you! Its not fair to him to be scared because two big dogs sudently moving in! Even for you would be a big change! \n\nYour so called friend was entitled and ungratfull. She didnt want to be apart from the dogs? Ok, all she had to say was \"thank you for the offer, but I'm cant be away from my dogs. I will arrange other solution\". But she choose to block you. Take her hint!", "NTA, You've already tried assisting her, she can't expect you to kick your cat out, also your house your rules.", "NTA. You are offering your home to her and the least she can do is to thank you and compromise, especially because you have cat.", "NTA. If she's so overprotective of her dogs, she should understand why you're overprotective of your cat. Why does she not?", "NTA. You could potentially put your cat in physical danger and definitely stress, you were more than fair.", "NTA. Part of the reason I won't own a dog is that I don't own a home. Stable housing is a thing.", "NTA and if she can\u2019t be grateful for your offer to shelter her, you should re-evaluate the friendship.", "NTA. It\u2019s the cat\u2019s home. His/her feelings matter. It is not your friend\u2019s home, you are doing her a favour. You aren\u2019t telling her to give up her dogs for good, just to temporarily use one of the many options where they could live apart from her but she could still visit. And people who get cross with you because the favour you are doing for them doesn\u2019t meet their exact terms are trash. You don\u2019t need a friend like that.", "NTA. Block her as well.", ">She went off on me and blocked me on everything.\n\nIt's great when problems arrive with built-in solutions.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about your cat, and so not agree to house some dogs.", "NTA in the slightest. I like dogs but housing two dogs of any size would be a huge imposition and unfair to any cat. With their size and this particular cat's disposition she is frankly being completely unreasonable and a total ingrate.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to help within your abilities she asked for more than you can provide and is angry that you refused.\n\nIt would be different if the dogs were to go to a shelter but her parents?", "NTA. \"Friend\"? No. You offered to do her a huge favor, but somehow it was not enough. Better that she will not be living with you, even without the dogs.", "Your cat comes before her dogs.  Simple as that.\n\nNTA", "NTA - good riddance and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA you dodged a potentially bad situation.", "Thank you!!! Entitled and ungrateful is exactly the right way to put it. She\u2019s bad mouthing me to our mutual friends and it\u2019s just frustrating. \n\nMy cat is the only thing that matters to me.

It is insane to me", "You're very often that kind of attitude is part of the reason they are homeless to begin with.

She must think her dogs are more important than my cat", "Exactly! I don\u2019t want her hiding, throwing up, losing hair, etc. \nit might make her mistrust me as well", "Oh 100%! There are studies that show how bad it is to constantly move animals from home to home especially with strangers", "Oh we are definitely not friends after this, thank you!", "Thank you, my cat comes first, forever. And I still want to help her (within reason) so it\u2019s crazy to me that she reacted this way.", "Haha! Seriously, thank you", "Hahaha exactly! Thank you!", "Right? My cat is my baby and she comes first", "Yes exactly. They are big and active and I\u2019m sure would chase my cat who will be in high stress mode day and night from them. Not worth it at all", "Right?!?! That\u2019s the crazy part to me. She has somewhere to keep the dogs until she\u2019s stable but she still went nuclear on me", "Yes our friendship is over after this. She is talking about me to our mutual friends and I\u2019m losing my mind", "Exactly! Why are her dogs more important than my cat???", "Yeah definitely- I\u2019m done with that friendship.", "Yeah she\u2019s definitely not a real friend, thank you", "Please don't beat on yourself over this. You don't need to say anything to the mutual friends. They surely know what a problem she is.", "No clue OP.  That\u2019s ridiculous to me.", "Yes I\u2019m really wondering how this will all play out. Especially with our mutual friend group. Thank you for your kind words.", "Thank you! I\u2019m pretty upset over her reaction", "I would be too.  You dodged a bullet OP!"]}
