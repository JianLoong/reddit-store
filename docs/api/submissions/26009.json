The dogs wouldnt even be homeless! \n\nYour cat is a priority for you! Its not fair to him to be scared because two big dogs sudently moving in! Even for you would be a big change! \n\nYour so called friend was entitled and ungratfull. She didnt want to be apart from the dogs?

Take her hint!", "NTA, You've already tried assisting her, she can't expect you to kick your cat out, also your house your rules.", "NTA. You are offering your home to her and the least she can do is to thank you and compromise, especially because you have cat.", "NTA. If she's so overprotective of her dogs, she should understand why you're overprotective of your cat. Why does she not?", "NTA. You could potentially put your cat in physical danger and definitely stress, you were more than fair.", "NTA. Part of the reason I won't own a dog is that I don't own a home. Stable housing is a thing.", "NTA and if she can\u2019t be grateful for your offer to shelter her, you should re-evaluate the friendship.", "NTA. It\u2019s the cat\u2019s home. His/her feelings matter. It is not your friend\u2019s home, you are doing her a favour. You aren\u2019t telling her to give up her dogs for good, just to temporarily use one of the many options where they could live apart from her but she could still visit. And people who get cross with you because the favour you are doing for them doesn\u2019t meet their exact terms are trash. You don\u2019t need a friend like that.", "NTA.

I like dogs but housing two dogs of any size would be a huge imposition and unfair to any cat. With their size and this particular cat's disposition she is frankly being completely unreasonable and a total ingrate.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to help within your abilities she asked for more than you can provide and is angry that you refused.\n\nIt would be different if the dogs were to go to a shelter but her parents?", "NTA. \"Friend\"? No. You offered to do her a huge favor, but somehow it was not enough. Better that she will not be living with you, even without the dogs.", "Your cat comes before her dogs.

His safet and happiness comes first.\n\nYes I\u2019m mostly surprised with her initial reaction to go nuclear.

She must think her dogs are more important than my cat", "Exactly! I don\u2019t want her hiding, throwing up, losing hair, etc. \nit might make her mistrust me as well", "Oh 100%! There are studies that show how bad it is to constantly move animals from home to home especially with strangers", "Oh we are definitely not friends after this, thank you!", "Thank you, my cat comes first, forever. And I still want to help her (within reason) so it\u2019s crazy to me that she reacted this way.", "Haha! Seriously, thank you", "Hahaha exactly! Thank you!", "Right? My cat is my baby and she comes first", "Yes exactly. They are big and active and I\u2019m sure would chase my cat who will be in high stress mode day and night from them. Not worth it at all", "Right?!?! That\u2019s the crazy part to me. She has somewhere to keep the dogs until she\u2019s stable but she still went nuclear on me", "Yes our friendship is over after this. She is talking about me to our mutual friends and I\u2019m losing my mind", "Exactly! Why are her dogs more important than my cat???", "Yeah definitely- I\u2019m done with that friendship.", "Yeah she\u2019s definitely not a real friend, thank you", "Please don't beat on yourself over this. You don't need to say anything to the mutual friends. They surely know what a problem she is.", "No clue OP.  That\u2019s ridiculous to me.", "Yes I\u2019m really wondering how this will all play out. Especially with our mutual friend group. Thank you for your kind words.", "Thank you! I\u2019m pretty upset over her reaction", "I would be too.  You dodged a bullet OP!", "NTA you offered help in the only way you can help right now.", "You dodged a bullet, dude. If she had agreed to park the dogs elsewhere, she'd show up at your door...with the two hounds, thinking you'll cave in rather than bar your door to her.\n\nDog owners today seem obsessed with executing home invasions with their animals, the more untrained and noisy the better.\n\nIt is as if they are unable to leave their house without their entourage.\n\nAnd by the way, anyone who goes off on you when she can't extract a (big) favor from you isn't your friend.\n\nNTA", "NTA - this is a temporary band-aid, not a permanent solution, and your \"friend\" needs to understand that she can either stay with you without her dogs, or she can stay somewhere else.

It\u2019s your cat\u2019s home and it gets to be comfortable in its own home. Plus, your friend\u2019s dogs have somewhere to go because people have offered to help. Out of curiosity, how big are the dogs?", "NTA\n\n\u201cIf you need it I can give you somewhere to sleep but I don\u2019t have the space for your dogs due to my cat\u201d is a valid and kind offer. You were clear with her. \n\nDoes it suck for her that she doesn\u2019t have somewhere to stay? Yes. Does it suck more that it\u2019s hard to find rentals suitable to having big dogs? Also yes.

How did it go down?  Seems to me, the further you move away from \u201cbeing completely upfront,\u201d the more you become the AH.", "Eeeeh..... I'm gonna say ESH. Why would you offer your place knowing she has large dogs that you can't/won't have in your home? Like, I understand, you're prioritizing your cat's safety and happiness as you should, but it feels kind of like a rug pull to be like \"Oh, you can come stay with me but your dogs can't.\" Just don't offer, or maybe offer to forward some cash for a hotel stay or something if you actually want to help. She's in a stressful situation, after all. Should she 'go off on you' because of it? No, of course not, but I certainly understand her heightened emotions.", "NTA.  If you rent and have pets it's your problem to find appropriate housing for them if you have to move.  I've taken in plenty of critters from friends with housing issues, and in fact have had three snakes since January after one friend had a house fire.  Fortunately no lives were lost but the power was out so the snakes needed new digs immediately because they have to be kept warm.", "NTA.  You offered her a place to live, and she has other people willing to take in the dogs.", "Agreed, And might I add, I wouldn't want to take the risk that the 2 large dogs might actually go after and harm or kill the cat, it's not like that never happens. Choosing beggars, man...", "Thank you because I\u2019m really struggling with her reaction. It\u2019s what made me question if ITA or not.", "Exactly, thank you. I cannot put my cat in danger to help someone, especially someone who treats me this poorly.", "If she showed up to my door that way I have no idea what my reaction would be. \n\n\u201cEntourage\u201d lol\n\nYes definitely using me, the friendship is over.", "Oh yeah there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to be in my life again let alone in my house with her dogs. \n\nThank you!", "Thank you!!", "They are both large pitbulls and have torn her apartment UP. I also don\u2019t want to be liable for that", "Right. I have the space for her but not her pitbulls (who rip her apartment to shreds and will scare my cat).\n\nIt\u2019s up to her to take care of it all now.", "Yes! Thank you!", "This was all within one text exchange. \n\nShe was texting me venting about her money issues, then her rent, then to eviction. So I said if worse comes to worst you can stay with me until you get back on your feet. I continued by saying we could share my bed (I also live in an apartment), or we could get her an air mattress in the living room, or couch, whatever she preferred. We continue to talk logistics when I thought about her dogs and mentioned it. (The reason I know her parents and friends will help with the dogs is that they have in the past for minor reasons, so I\u2019m sure they would with her being evicted)\nShe lost it saying her dogs are her babies and how can I expect her to leave them with someone else while she stays with me, etc. She blocked me in the end.", "As I mentioned above, her dogs have a place to stay. I didn\u2019t mention it initially because when I saw her text \u201ceviction\u201d, I immediately just thought of the best solution I could offer her. Hotels won\u2019t take two large pitbulls either.", "I had a \u201cfriend\u201d like this. \n\nToo entitled and irresponsible to put a roof over his own, or his family\u2019s, head. \n\nHe was a pretty smooth talker and fun to be around, so he kept manage to lie to other people to get them to move in with him, and then he\u2019d stop paying rent until his whole family got kicked out. \n\nLast I knew he was moving back in with mommy at 40 years old because he\u2019d run out of people who trusted him enough to care.", "And by extension, she must think she's more important than you. Thus, she's not really your friend, and you should rescind your offer of hospitality.\n\nYou have to keep in mind that if she's evicted, she has no leverage here, and she should take what she can get. She should be grateful that you're letting her stay with you, but instead she's badmouthing you. She's a major AH here to expect that she can freeload.", "Absolutely not.  She needs to be realistic.", "If she gets in touch again trying to plead her case tell her you feel the same way about your cat as she does about her dogs. Just as she doesn't want to be separated from her dogs you don't want your cat upset and frightened in their own home. But don't apologise for anything, you've done nothing wrong so there's no need.

Or not that help either followed by complete shock they actually have to do any of it themselves. if she blocked you over that, she doesn't sound like much of a friend.", "Nta", "NTA And she's not your friend. You have a cat that deserves not to be traumatized in it's own home.", "NTA good riddance!!! Move along.", "I would be so upset if she did that, I\u2019m glad she showed me her true colors.", "Seriously!! Idk how it was worth ending our friendship over me attempting to help her out", "Exactly. If I didn\u2019t have my cat I would\u2019ve helped her and her dogs in a heartbeat", "Those are my thoughts exactly", "Exactly. I just can\u2019t help the dogs, but they can go elsewhere. We are done being friends.", "Thank you! She obviously does not care about me/my cat at all. Only her dogs (who have a place to go).", "Based on her response to you saying she could come but the dogs couldn't, that's likely what would've happened.", "NTA she\u2019s stressed right now but her reaction is over the top.\nI was going to be potentially homeless for two weeks once and I had a large dog.\nMy brother said if I could find somewhere else for the dog I could stay at his house.\nHe doesn\u2019t have pets. He did not want to deal with the mess a large long haired dog brings and that\u2019s OK.\nYou did not do anything wrong.\nPut it behind you and move on.", "NTA at all. I dislike animals myself", "NTA.  And problem solved.", "Info: Did the offer for her to come stay, and the fact that she can't bring her dogs come in the same conversation? Or did you offer her to come stay, and then told her the dogs weren't welcome at a later time?", "NTA -  however to 110% confirm this opinion,  we need a cat tax please.", "Isn't it great when the trash takes itself out?\n\nNTA OP.", "The problem resolved itself - she isn't talking to you, so it's no longer an issue.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like you not only dodged a bullet but a whole barrage of bullets.  Count your blessings and move on.", "NTA - Modern apartment dwelling dog owners are the worst. People that don't own their own yards shouldn't own dogs. It means the multiple times a day those dogs need to shit, they are doing so on someone else's property. I'm guessing those dogs are completely untrained and barely house broken if at all. You did the right thing. You would have been terrorized.", "Any friends who think to criticize are more than welcome to take her and her two huge dogs in.  Oh\u2026circumstances aren\u2019t conducive to doing that?  Hello, pot.", "Oh yeah, I love pitties but they\u2019re soooo high energy (to the point of being destructive when not provided with the proper toys) and even well behaved ones would definitely scare an already skittish cat.", "No, just block her now.

(Cats are fine) That being said\u2026if you have a dog large or small wanting to try and live together\u2026.I would think 1. some research on the topic is important. 2. Figure out how to introduce each other without stress and bloodshed. 3. If the owner of the home and cat says No. you say ok. & respect it! \n\u2026.Blocking people in the 90\u2019s so easy.
