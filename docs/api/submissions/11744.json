You are in no way obligated to help another student. Even if it was a case of you just didn\u2019t want to help you still would not be an asshole.", "NTA\n\nhow TF does she get to demand you to help her and then call you a bad neighbour for focussing on your own work?\n\nNope, she's an asshole for that.", "NTA. Not your responsibility to teach other students. Great if you're able to help and decide to - which you did - but it's not fair of another student to \\*expect\\* you to help them and get mad if you don't.", "NTA you told her the truth. Helping her would have meant that you are missing the class contents yourself, so you did not have the capability to help her. It's the teacher's job anyway.", "NTA\n\n> I tell Wander what to do, she doesn\u2019t do it\n\nThis sounds to me more like she wants someone to do the work for her rather than someone mentor her. You have no obligation to do that.", "NTA - Unless you have assigned seats, find a new spot to sit from now on. \n\nIf your seats are assigned, I'd suggest just not helping her anymore. She sounds ungrateful and entitled.", "NTA it\u2019s not your job to help her, especially in the middle of the lecture", "NTA while it's nice to help it shouldn't be at the expense of your own education. She needs to go get tutoring or find extra help outside of class", "NTA.  You need to learn this stuff before you can help anyone else. Since she needs additional help,  she should schedule regular sessions with the course teaching assistant or the teacher.", "NTA.  You are putting yourself in jeopardy and she is not at a level where she needs to be.  If the instructor can't help her or she doesn't arrange tutoring, she will fail and that's not your responsibility.  She is actually the ah for attempting to manipulate you.", "You're not her crutch, nor does how close you are to her seat obligate you to anything from her. ESPECIALLY if she doesn't listen the first time.\n\nNTA - you did more than I would have in the same situation (where you had computer issues, etc).", "NTA. If the teacher is still talking, hold your hand up and tell her that you will answer once he is finished and you have a free moment.  She's an asshole for interrupting.   Next - help is not expected from anyone and is given as a gift.  She seems to lack confidence in herself and is forgetting, asking too much and taking advantage.", "NTA - Her is education is not your problem", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wander needs a tutor to get up to speed.", "Can you imagine what this is like for someone in elementary school, getting partnered with a \"wander\" just so classrooms can be inclusive? \n\nJust yesterday my kid said she was asked to re explain the assignment to a deskmate.  My shy kid was at a loss.  She was trying to do her best with what she had been told and did not feel confident in instructing someone else.", "NTA tell wander to wander off hahaha", "NTA. Sounds like in an ideal world, Wander would have to drop and retake the class, not inconvenience and distract everyone around her who IS catching on, and who wants/needs to pass the course. You don\u2019t indicate that you two are personal friends outside of class, but it doesn\u2019t sound as if you owe her a thing. You keep focusing on your own studies and leave her to her own devices. And if she approaches you again, let her know, as gently or as strongly as you need to, that your focus is on YOUR success, she needs to focus on her own studies, and if she ends up having to repeat the class, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like some prime weaponized incompetence, if this is a habit of hers.", "NTA", "NTA. No. Not only are you NTA, you are a saint for having given Wander so much help. \\[...which she did not appreciate the value of.\\]", "NTA. Ignore her. She's demonstrating something called \"learned helplessness\" and honestly ignoring her to force to her to do alone is the best thing you can do for her too. She will only learn to be independent when forced.", "NTA. Its not on your to help others. Would it be nice? Of course. But if she cant get through a class without asking for help than she either over (under?) estimated her abilities, just wants someone to actually do it for her, or is just messing around. Move seats if possible and just maybe let the teacher know so they are aware. Dont compromise your education. I work with 3rd graders who tend to be a helpful bunch, typically they ask of they can help around after theyve finished their project or finished with our current step."]}
