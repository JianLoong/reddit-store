Jordan is a great dog - he has been through multiple training camps and had a personal trainer when he was a puppy because we knew how destructive he could possibly be. He is an incredibly sweet dog who is very obedient. We\u2019ve boarded him while we were away multiple times and there has never been any problems. \n\nMy best friend \u201cLucy\u201d (24F) is not a dog person by any means. I\u2019d say she\u2019s met maybe 3 dogs in her lifetime. She means well, but she just has no clue how dogs operate. For example, Jordan gets triggered by firework sounds like most dogs do and will get very scared and defensive when he hears it. Usually, we keep him in his crate whenever fireworks go off to both make him happier and not have to deal with a terrified 120 lb dog. At my last 4th of July party,  Lucy decided to start the fireworks early while the dog was right next to the fireworks. Jordan was terrified and barking uncontrollably, running around the backyard, which he never does. Again, she meant no harm by it she just doesn\u2019t know enough about dogs to realize how scary certain things can be for them.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been keeping Jordan at my house whenever I go away. I\u2019ll have a friend or family member Jordan is familiar with stay at the house with him. I prefer doing this because then Jordan doesn\u2019t have to get used to a new environment and doesn\u2019t have to sleep in a crate at night. I\u2019ve had many of my friends who have other dogs or know Jordan very well stay with him at the house. I\u2019m leaving for a week long vacation next week, and Lucy asked me if she could be the one to watch my house and my dog. I told her I didn\u2019t know if it would work because of her inexperience caring for a dog, especially one as big as Jordan. She told me that her boyfriend has a mini poodle so she\u2019s been getting used to dogs and she\u2019s positive she can care for him. She also said she\u2019s spent a lot of time with Jordan and knows him pretty well by now. I still refused, telling her that caring for a 120lb dog is very different from caring for a 15lb one. I thought it would be better both for her and for Jordan if I got someone else. \n\nLucy is very mad at me. She stormed out saying how I just don\u2019t trust her and I\u2019m underestimating her. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me for a while, she says she would trust me with her life and I won\u2019t even trust her with my dog. My boyfriend agrees with me about her not being competent, but my parents say if it means this much to her I should just let her. I have known Lucy for basically my whole life and my parents say that because of all the history, I should trust her.

That should have been the end of it without whining and pouting. That's literally the way a small child reacts when you tell them \"no.\"\n\nAlso, it is weird to me that she is pushing this so hard.

Danes are called gentle giants for a reason, but give them the perfect storm of bad stuff and they can still snap, just like any other breed.

I know BIG guys who have ended up face-planting from a medium sized dog taking off on them suddenly. I can control a large dog despite how small I am, but I grew up walking a very stubborn and misbehaved dog bigger than I was.

It was a purebred German Shepherd pup that she'd paid a lot for from a reputable breeder. It already had a wait list of applicants.
