{"id": 15096, "submission_id": "12qni2u", "title": "AITA for not letting my best friend stay at my house?", "selftext": "I (24F) live with my bf (25M) and a 120lb Great Dane (dog) who is just over 4 years old named Jordan. Jordan is a great dog - he has been through multiple training camps and had a personal trainer when he was a puppy because we knew how destructive he could possibly be. He is an incredibly sweet dog who is very obedient. We\u2019ve boarded him while we were away multiple times and there has never been any problems. \n\nMy best friend \u201cLucy\u201d (24F) is not a dog person by any means. I\u2019d say she\u2019s met maybe 3 dogs in her lifetime. She means well, but she just has no clue how dogs operate. For example, Jordan gets triggered by firework sounds like most dogs do and will get very scared and defensive when he hears it. Usually, we keep him in his crate whenever fireworks go off to both make him happier and not have to deal with a terrified 120 lb dog. At my last 4th of July party,  Lucy decided to start the fireworks early while the dog was right next to the fireworks. Jordan was terrified and barking uncontrollably, running around the backyard, which he never does. Again, she meant no harm by it she just doesn\u2019t know enough about dogs to realize how scary certain things can be for them.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been keeping Jordan at my house whenever I go away. I\u2019ll have a friend or family member Jordan is familiar with stay at the house with him. I prefer doing this because then Jordan doesn\u2019t have to get used to a new environment and doesn\u2019t have to sleep in a crate at night. I\u2019ve had many of my friends who have other dogs or know Jordan very well stay with him at the house. I\u2019m leaving for a week long vacation next week, and Lucy asked me if she could be the one to watch my house and my dog. I told her I didn\u2019t know if it would work because of her inexperience caring for a dog, especially one as big as Jordan. She told me that her boyfriend has a mini poodle so she\u2019s been getting used to dogs and she\u2019s positive she can care for him. She also said she\u2019s spent a lot of time with Jordan and knows him pretty well by now. I still refused, telling her that caring for a 120lb dog is very different from caring for a 15lb one. I thought it would be better both for her and for Jordan if I got someone else. \n\nLucy is very mad at me. She stormed out saying how I just don\u2019t trust her and I\u2019m underestimating her. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me for a while, she says she would trust me with her life and I won\u2019t even trust her with my dog. My boyfriend agrees with me about her not being competent, but my parents say if it means this much to her I should just let her. I have known Lucy for basically my whole life and my parents say that because of all the history, I should trust her.

She hasn't given you a single reason to trust her other than words.

To me, it sounds like she wants to stay at your place for some reason, the dog is just an inconvenience she has to sort. And then: using guilt to manipulate you into saying yes is a low blow; you might trust her with your life, but not your dog's; not to mention that someone considering you competent and reliable doesn't mean you are required to feel that way about them. \n\nDo not let her look after your dog.", "NTA - you have a boundary, \"inexperienced people do not watch your dog.\" Your friend can either respect this or try and undermine your boundary. \n\nIt's your dog and your choice.

Hold your ground!", "NTA.\n\nTrust is an overloaded word.  You can trust someone's *motives*, but not trust their *judgement* or their *ability*.  And the \"how much it means to her\" part and the \"all the history\" part, those have no bearing on the trusting of judgement or ability.", "NTA although I am not sure why a self described non-dog person would sign up for watching a great dane for a week. Do you have a pool or something?", "NTA if you don't trust her then don't let anyone talk you into it. If you parents think your friendship with Lucy is more important than the well being of  your dog, let them have her watch him at their house.", "NTA. She made a request of you, and you said no. That should have been the end of it without whining and pouting. That's literally the way a small child reacts when you tell them \"no.\"\n\nAlso, it is weird to me that she is pushing this so hard. It sounds like it's about more than the dog. No one would fight this hard to watch a dog they weren't close to if they weren't wanting something out of it.", "NTA   \n1. She is clearly not a dog person  \n2. Your dog clearly needs someone who is a dog person  \n3. You have a duty of care to another living thing and it absolutely should be your priority and right to get to decide who looks after it  \n4. The way she is throwing a hissy fit over this clearly demonstrates how unsuitable she really is to do this", "NTA, you aren\u2019t comfortable with it. And you said no, that\u2019s really all she needs to know. Your dog, your house, your call.", "NTA\n\nI have 2 beagles. I'm extremely careful who I leave them with as one is an epileptic and the other has anxiety issues. \n\nso, I completely understand your hesitation about leaving your BIG dog with an inexperienced person. \n\nshe'll get over it. or, she won't. if this is her hill to die no, so be it.", "NTA. I have a 43lb husky that is incredibly sweet, well trained, and she loves company, but she is SMART. As soon as she realizes someone doesn't know her tricks, she tries to see what she can get away with.

That is straight desparation. Maybe she feels left out by not being able to care for your dog like your other friends. In any case it's probably better for everyone that you just do what you feel is best for your dog.", "Nta.

I understand Lucy maybe being hurt because you \"don't trust her\" but some hurt feelings are better than her accidentally harming your pup.", "NTA...If you don't trust her to properly care for your dog, then she's not a good fit.

Lucy is going to fuck up one way or the other, so I wouldn't trust her one bit with the dog.", "NTA- there's a reason your intuition is telling you not to trust her with this responsibility. There's a reason we have that intuition and listening to your gut almost always leads you in the right direction in my experience. It's sucks that Lucy's feeling are hurt but you have to look out for the care and well being of Jordan, that's more important than someone's bruised ego", "NTA- There's a big difference between a great dane and a mini poodle.

What you said to her doesn't come out of nowhere, and she knows that..\n\nAnd why does she offer to dog-sit? Most people do it reluctantly, out of obligation, not because it's fun.

What you can do is help her continue to spend time with you and your dog, learn more about your dog and maybe include the friends or family you do trust to care for your dog along with her visits, to share any extra tips they might do that work/is safe/no issues and hopefully that are OK with you. Also, if you do decide to do a trial run in the future even if it's just a weekend and you're just at bfs place the whole time, these other friends or family can check on her too once a day or something.\n\nIt sucks that she's mad and hurt, but hopefully, if she's willing to listen to you and still be open to wanting to learn, then please do so. Hopefully once she does gain more experience she will finally get it and understand it's a big responsibility, it's not that you don't trust her, you just want what's best for two of your best friends and safety should be in there too.

Caring for a 120 pound house horse is completely different then caring for a 15 pound pupper. Likely, Lucy has not even been fully involved with the mini poodle\u2019s care either.
