Jordan is a great dog - he has been through multiple training camps and had a personal trainer when he was a puppy because we knew how destructive he could possibly be. He is an incredibly sweet dog who is very obedient. We\u2019ve boarded him while we were away multiple times and there has never been any problems. \n\nMy best friend \u201cLucy\u201d (24F) is not a dog person by any means. I\u2019d say she\u2019s met maybe 3 dogs in her lifetime. She means well, but she just has no clue how dogs operate. For example, Jordan gets triggered by firework sounds like most dogs do and will get very scared and defensive when he hears it. Usually, we keep him in his crate whenever fireworks go off to both make him happier and not have to deal with a terrified 120 lb dog. At my last 4th of July party,  Lucy decided to start the fireworks early while the dog was right next to the fireworks. Jordan was terrified and barking uncontrollably, running around the backyard, which he never does. Again, she meant no harm by it she just doesn\u2019t know enough about dogs to realize how scary certain things can be for them.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been keeping Jordan at my house whenever I go away. I\u2019ll have a friend or family member Jordan is familiar with stay at the house with him. I prefer doing this because then Jordan doesn\u2019t have to get used to a new environment and doesn\u2019t have to sleep in a crate at night. I\u2019ve had many of my friends who have other dogs or know Jordan very well stay with him at the house. I\u2019m leaving for a week long vacation next week, and Lucy asked me if she could be the one to watch my house and my dog. I told her I didn\u2019t know if it would work because of her inexperience caring for a dog, especially one as big as Jordan. She told me that her boyfriend has a mini poodle so she\u2019s been getting used to dogs and she\u2019s positive she can care for him. She also said she\u2019s spent a lot of time with Jordan and knows him pretty well by now. I still refused, telling her that caring for a 120lb dog is very different from caring for a 15lb one. I thought it would be better both for her and for Jordan if I got someone else. \n\nLucy is very mad at me. She stormed out saying how I just don\u2019t trust her and I\u2019m underestimating her. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me for a while, she says she would trust me with her life and I won\u2019t even trust her with my dog. My boyfriend agrees with me about her not being competent, but my parents say if it means this much to her I should just let her. I have known Lucy for basically my whole life and my parents say that because of all the history, I should trust her.

Even still, I don\u2019t know how comfortable I\u2019d be to watch a dog I don\u2019t know very well at that size.", "If your friend thinks that knowing *you* for a long time means she's qualified to look after a *very* large dog for an extended period of time, unsupervised, that's proof that she *isn't* qualified to look after Jordan.\n\nKnowing a person for a long time doesn't mean you're qualified to take care of their dependents; pets, kids, or otherwise.\n\nNTA, OP.", "I love my boyfriend but he hates cats. Even if he offered I would never let him watch my cat for a week. NTA", "Nta if you want to give her a chance do it on a day you\u2019ll only be gone for a few hours and see how she\u2019s does or maybe an overnight first. A week is a long time for an inexperienced dog sitter.", "NTA. Giant breeds require special handling and training, for the *human*. My friend ended up in the hospital unexpectedly, and I took care of her 130lb newfoundland for four days. I'm great with animals and have my own (50 lb) dog. It was very, very challenging, and honestly a little scary- he's a sweetie who knows me but he still outweighs me by about 15lbs. My arms and back were sore from just walking him. I'm sorry your friend doesn't understand the challenges of giant breeds, but for her safety, and your dogs safety, it's best to have a more experienced party look after him.", "Fireworks should not scare dogs!  It's more often than not the owners fault.\n\nWhat do you do when you first tell your puppy to sit and it does?  You get excited and say good doggy, that's a good puppy!, etc, etc.  Reinforcing the behaviour you want to see.f\n\nWhat do people do when dogs get scared by loud noises?  They cuddle and coddle the dog, tell it that's a good girl, it's okay, there there, while holding it and being excited.  See the problem?  You are teaching the dog that acting scared by loud noises is the appropriate response!  \n\nTake a look at what hunters do to train puppies and dogs to be okay around loud gunshots.  When a loud noise startles a dog don't coddle it, instead distract it.  Have the dogs favorite toy  to play with, a couple treats to distract, etc.  This works great.  All my dogs have slept through fireworks and the like.", "NTA and NO WAY IN HELL!!! all this spells disaster waiting to happen. A big dog, no matter how smart and well behaved, can get hurt and hurt others by accident. I have a 66 pound dog and when she's running on full speed and bumps into me, she almost sends me straight to the ground and she's half yours!!! if she wants to affirm herself on competence, she should find another mountain to climb. One that will not cost you dog's wellbeing. Between my dog being safe and a friend's hurt feelings, I will always choose my dog because she's my responsibility to keep safe.", "NTA - there are a lot of people who I would trust my life with, but who I *wouldn't* trust to dogsit for me. Dogs and humans are very different. \n\nFurther, if Lucy can't understand how a week long vacation isn't the right time to try dog-sitting then that alone is enough to say no. I would NEVER have someone who's never dog-sat before start out on more than a simple day trip or overnight.", "NTA. I have a similar setup when I go on vacations, and only two of my friends have enough experience with big dogs that I feel comfortable leaving my GSD with. Actually one of my friends has a small dog, but does not like bigger dogs and has offered to watch if we really need him but admitted he would prefer not to because of inexperience. He loves our GSD and spends a lot of time with him every week, because I host game nights, but isn\u2019t familiar with him in his day-to-day activities. Briefly socializing with the dog is not the same as caring for it, and definitely not the same care as a small breed.", "NTA.  Do NOT let her take care of your dog!  She is clueless", "NTA at all! Caring for a dog isn't something to be willy nilly with", "NTA.  Hi, I'm waving excitedly at another dane mama.  I have several danes and they are MY WORLD.  There is zero way I would leave my dogs with her.  Giant breeds are a whole other ball game and there's no way I'd let someone that is inexperienced watch my babies.  Let her feelings be hurt.  Your pups deserve someone that is trustworth, calm/patient, and loving towards dogs.  \n\nFor what it's worth, my sister is my best friend.  Like my closest friend in the world and no way in hell would I trust her to watch my dogs.  I love her dearly, but no...just no. lol ( I won't get into why), so the whole sob story from your parents of you just letting her b/c you've known her your whole life is just a bunch of BS.", "NTA. At all.\n\nDogsitting is *work,* especially with a large dog; almost no one is actually eager to do it \u2013 to pack up everything you need, as if going on vacation, but just to move across town temporarily, sleep in an unfamiliar bed, deal with a dog that isn't yours... It's not fun, it's something people do for money. Lucy just wants to use OP's house for the access to a pool, tennis court, etc. Leaving Jordan's life in the hands of someone so stunningly oblivious that she started setting off fireworks *right next to a dog* would be negligent in the extreme.", "NTA - If she's such a good friend she should be able to respect the decisions you make for your family's safety. NTA at all. \n\nP.S. Please give Jordan some extra tummy rubs from us Redditors! :)", "NTA\n\nThe reason we have a bichon is BECAUSE it is so much easier to care for one. You can pick it up and move it when you need to.", "This is the equivalent of \"I just got my learners permit, and have been getting used to my mom's car. Why can't I drive your 18-wheeler????\"\n\n\nNTA", "Hell no NTA. And if that is her reaction, you are 150% right in not letting her and standing your ground. She is clearly not mature enough to care for your dog like that. \n\nDogs are not a toy. Good on your for putting your doggo first", "I honestly think your friend just wants to play house with her BF.  \n\n\nNTA, do what's best for you pup!", "Plus the friend getting angry and essentially throwing a tantrum makes them seem immature. Combined with previous poor judgment I also wouldn\u2019t fee comfortable leaving my dog with this person. OP is definitely NTA for making their dogs safety and well being a priority over protecting their friends fragile feelings", "My dog dropped dead the day after being scared by fireworks. He was always scared by them, but this particular night the fireworks were extra loud and lasted even longer than usual.\nThe next day, we went for our walk as usual, he went into the woods to explore as he often did, and never returned. We found him 4 weeks later, dead. He\u2019d ever have run away or not come home, so it was clear he died that night.\n\nWhy did OP even have fireworks if they have a dog who\u2019s terrified of them?", "This is such an important distinction!! Your phrasing is something I will be using moving forward", "OP has a pool, friend wants a party house -__-", "In the last two weeks our neighborhood FB lost and found pages have had 6 or 7 huskies either loose or caught. I saw one happy little goofball being loaded into a cop car.\n\nHuskies are the champs at escaping.", "That was my thought, too. \n\nThere is a **reason** Lucy wants access to that house for a week.\n\nNormal people just shrug when turned down on an offer of dog and house-sitting. Might even be a little relived, because that's a lot of work!\n\nLucy is acting like she was deprived of something she *wanted.* She's now trying to pummel OP with emotional manipulation to get them to change their mind. There is a lot more afoot than simply being miffed OP turned down the offer.", "I don\u2019t know how to copy ops response on another comment but apparently she has a pool and access to a beach and tennis\u2026 so less about wanting to dog sit and more wanting a free vacation house for a week", "The place I adopted my last dog was running a special the week before the 4th to make room for the incoming dogs.", "Yes OP said they have a pool and community tennis court. Ding ding! Friend wants to party at the house and doesn\u2019t care about the dog!", "This is the information we really needed", "It may be as simple as her trying to prove to herself she is getting over her fear.", "Yeah I had the displeasure of finding out that my dog was scared of fireworks cause of my neighbors. I got home and decided to take my dog on a walk on July 3rd cause it was only 4:30, so plenty of light and he needed his exercise before the crazy started. One of my neighbors decided that was the perfect time to set off a massive firework that they couldn't even see (and legally shouldn't have used), and my dog ended up practically dragging me back home. They also only used the one, and didn't pop off anything else until the next day, and none were that big.", "I had a friend whose dog had a stroke from the stress of fireworks, she passed away a few months later from issues stemming from that.", "And those needs are met differently between the two breeds", "No, it's actually a very, very reasonable take.", "If someone who had very little experience with dogs, and on one prior occasion, endangered my dog (she\u2019s getting used to it, but her bfs mini poodle cannot be compared to a great dane) was insistent that she wanted to stay at my house, with access to a pool/beach/community amenities, with me not having asked her to, I would second guess her motives, and it would be fair of me to do so\n\nI know dogs are different than children, but you wouldn\u2019t trust someone who endangered your child previously and has no idea how to care for kids, to babysit for you, for an extended period of time", "Everyone downvoting you but I agree that this is a ridiculous leap in logic. OP states that this friend has been her friend for such a long time and everyone really just assumes the worst of intentions from her. Reddit be like that though I suppose"]}
