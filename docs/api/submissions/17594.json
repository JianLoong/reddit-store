She comes from a family with two sisters, her very involved mother and her father who isn\u2019t really that involved (he lives out of state). My fianc\u00e9e is a SAHM, the middle sister has a husband, no kids but is seemingly married to her career. The eldest, is a single mother to a 12 year old girl. She\u2019s not very self sufficient, but I\u2019ll get into that in a minute. \n\nCouple weeks ago the eldest sister was involved in an accident at work. She\u2019s had three separate surgeries and is now in a rehab facility for an unknown amount of time while she recovers. After the accident, our niece came to live with us. Basically my fianc\u00e9e and her mom have been up to their necks trying to sort through this sister\u2019s affairs. Everything is a mess, from her house to her finances.\n\nAnyways, every day after I get home from work my fianc\u00e9e and her mom are off to go tend to the sister and/or her colossal amount of problems. Few nights ago while getting dinner going for the kids, I asked my niece to bring the bathroom hamper downstairs. Our daughter has her own bathroom which she now shares with her cousin. It wasn\u2019t a thing we thought about so they both ended up using the same hamper. \n\nThe hamper was full and my niece had more dirty clothes on her bedroom floor. I began sorting the laundry as she went back upstairs to collect the rest. To my utter shock, I found 3 pairs of her underwear that had pads attached. When she got to the laundry room she saw them set aside. My exact words were, \u201cHon, you need to peel the pads off and throw them away before tossing your underwear in the dirty pile.\u201d \n\nHer response was simple, \u201cMy mom takes care of that.\u201d I was kind of like\u2026.\u2019wat?\u2019 Because the pads were beyond full I asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you change your pads out a couple times throughout the day?\u201d Her response, \u201cNo.\u201d Suddenly it occurred to me, I had smelled something off color the previous day after picking her up from school. Of course, I wasn\u2019t going to point that out to her. But I did tell her that you\u2019re supposed to change and discard the pads in the trash multiple times a day, especially when you wake up in the morning. \n\nObviously I upset her because she took a pile of her clothes and threw them on the floor, then stormed off to her room. She wouldn\u2019t come back down for dinner either. While cleaning up, I get a call from my niece\u2019s mother. \u201cWho do you think you are speaking to my daughter about her period?\u201d She completely went off on me saying I was so far out of line for not only embarrassing her child but putting her in an uncomfortable situation because I\u2019m a male. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t hear me out at all, I had to hang up because my fianc\u00e9e was calling. I explained every to her and her mom to which they said what I did was fine. She requested her mom take her daughter seeing that I\u2019ve now traumatized her. That\u2019s not even possible though, so as it stands right now the kid won\u2019t speak to me per her mother\u2019s instructions.", "created_utc": 1684446327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lbvba/aita_for_having_a_menstruation_hygiene_talk_with/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because of this, we took our niece in while her mother recovers. One evening I was doing the kid\u2019s laundry and discovered 3 pairs of underwear that had menstruation pads still attached. I spoke to my niece about it, and told her the proper hygiene of using them. Her mother has said that was extremely inappropriate of me. She claimed I caused her daughter embarrassment and put her in an uncomfortable situation. Because I\u2019ve always been super close with my sister, and that 90% of my friends are female, I didn\u2019t think it was wrong in the moment. I saw an issue that needed to be corrected. But I\u2019ve now realized since she\u2019s not my daughter, I might be the AH for saying something. I should have maybe waited to bring it up to my fianc\u00e9e and let her handle it.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Feminine hygiene is important, and it is absolutely NOT normal to wear the same pad all day like you described. And the fact that the pad wasn\u2019t disposed of is gross.\n\nETA: I just noticed at the end that you said you were male, and I just want to say that being male doesn\u2019t matter. You are just looking out for your niece, and being rightfully concerned over her health.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re taking care of this kid, and it sounds like she either wasn\u2019t taught properly or didn\u2019t understand what she was taught. \n\nI think you handled it very well. \n\nHer mother\u2026not so much.", "NTA. Firstly, you were the one doing the laundry. It would've been JUST AS AWKWARD if you told your wife and then she spoke to your neice, because your neice would still know that you know - and that adds a layer of weird due to the game of telephone in the middle. Secondly, in your house, *disposable menstrual products don't go in the laundry*, that's a \"your house, your rules\" thing clearly. (Though TBH it's kinda nasty that some houses don't have that rule...)\n\nThe only AH here is your SIL/your neice's mom for not giving her the right info about how to deal with her period to begin with. I can't imagine how often she's had to wipe blood off a pad that just can't absorb any more because her mom lied to her about how frequently to change your pads. She's responsible for the confusion and embarassment.\n\nOP, since your SIL has suggested the issue is that you're male, you should also talk to your wife about talking to your neice other period stuff--like wrapping the pad in TP after she peels it off before she throws it in the trash.", "NTA, not even a little.  There is nothing wrong with what you said or did.  Men knowing about menstruation is a GOOD thing.  You didn\u2019t shame her, you informed her.  Good job!  SIL is a whackadoodle.", "NTA. Of her mother isn\u2019t going to teach her proper hygiene, someone has to. I don\u2019t think this was so bad. Maybe a little embarrassing for a 12 year old but better to learn now that\u2019s being called out at school for being the stinky girl. That would be traumatic. You were not saying this in front of a group of people and hopefully she will understand what you said before too long. Maybe your fianc\u00e9e can give her a more detailed talk?", "NTA. You were doing the laundry and got slapped in the face with dirty pads. That\u2019s gross and she does need to know the things you told her. Her mom needs to do better.", "NTA\nThis is a problem that will harm her socially, due to the smell, and physically, because of the health problems it can cause.", "Nta your sil sounds honestly concerning and I feel real secondhand embarrassment for your niece for being in that situation at all.", "NTA. I'll confess, when I saw you are a man and just the fianc\u00e9e of this girl's aunt, my immediate reaction was NO, you are not the person to have a period conversation with a teen girl.  That said, this topic arose really naturally (you were sorting the laundry together), she didn't seem shocked or embarrassed when you came across the pads, and you limited your talk to \"please change and throw these away in the future.\" \n\nMy guess is that her mom was freaking out because she was caught teaching her daughter bad habits just to save a few bucks on pads. It's unfortunate you're being called a bad guy when all you've done is help her out.", "NTA it's natural for her to be embarrassed. But... she was expecting you to clean and dispose of her days old used pads without a second thought. You were not out of line to Inform her that isn't hygienic. If she wanted to not talk about period hygiene with you, she should have cleaned up after herself. She's 12. She knows where the trash is.", "NTA. You should not have to touch that and it wasn't like you sought her out. She came into the room. She might be embarrassed but the people saying she is traumatized must never have went through real trauma. You didn't even go into detail, just told her some proper hygiene.

That is a health and hygiene issue that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. She\u2019s a young girl and likely embarrassed so is blaming you. When really it\u2019s her mother who is at fault for not teaching her basic menstrual hygiene. She set that girl up to be embarrassed.

Mom doing laundry should\u2019ve noticed the smell & pattern of leaving used pads and should\u2019ve addressed it. You did the best you could in the situation. It would\u2019ve been incompetent of you to just ignore it.", "NTA. This is an issue of hygiene. You were doing what was necessary. I suspect your niece may be embarrassed. Also, in what world does your sister think that this is acceptable?", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. This sort of thing can lead to infections and she needs to learn about them. Especially as she won't be living when she finds a place of her own, and more importantly now whilst your SIL is recovering.\n\nYour SIL is the AH. She shouldn't have gone off on you, especially as you are taking care of her daughter. I understand that is a bit embarrassing to talk to a man about these issues (periods and all) but its 100% normal. I think your SIL just doesn't want her daughter to grow up.", "NTA. your poor niece. being taught the wrong things and then being embarrassed. while it would\u2019ve been good to tell your wife first and let her talk to her about it, because sometimes it\u2019s just easier when it\u2019s woman to woman and she may have felt a little less embarrassed, it\u2019s better that it was a family member who talked about it to her instead of being bullied later in school for smelling bad. plus, stopping this behavior and teaching her the right way may have potentially saved her from any infection or irritation, it\u2019s not good to be sitting in a very full pad of blood for hours to whole days. you were just looking out for her and trying to help a problem that definitely needed to be addressed", "NTA. Honestly, I think you handled it well. You didn\u2019t yell at her or humiliate her, you simply explained how she was supposed to take care of it. I cannot freaking BELIEVE that her mother didn\u2019t teach her that and is just letting her throw her underwear in with the pads still attached?? Like she didn\u2019t teach her how to take them off and wrap them up and put them in the garbage? Wow. She is really doing her daughter a disservice and there was no woman home to talk to her. And honestly, I know men who probably would have avoided it and had their wife talk to her later. I don\u2019t thing you did anything wrong.", "NTA - this is something she needs to know for hygiene and health. If you could smell something, so could kids at school. This will be down to personal belief I guess - but I think a man having this conversation with her frankly and without fuss is actually setting a very healthy precedent about periods not being some taboo \u2018secret\u2019 that men must be sheltered from. Maybe the follow up conversation should come from both you and aunt, as she\u2019s clearly embarrassed and that\u2019s not her fault, but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA that poor girl is just walking around with a full pad for the entirety of her period? If her mother has such a problem with you giving her daughter the proper advice about her period then she should have done it. It's borderline neglect.", "NTA but I seriously urge you to ensure that child does not go back into her care. Leaving used pads in her clothes, not changing pads-- these are pretty serious hygiene and health issues. If her mom doesn't think they're a problem, and the kid is already this mad and defensive at such a young age, there's something wrong in that house.", "NTA. She needed to hear that pads need to be changed multiple times and she risks harming herself unintentionally. Just because you\u2019re a man doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t say something to her.", "NTA. As a woman your advice was correct. Even if you are a man, the girl\u2019s mom is a woman and not advising her correctly!", "'traumatize' what an easy word to use, ppl should stop using every damn word for everything, there is no trauma here, I'm really tired on some people.

I\u2019m not going to deny that. \n\nHowever\u2026while I understand that your heart was in the right place, having been a young girl myself once I\u2019d have been mortified if one of my uncles had had this type of conversation with me. The better way to handle it would have been to discuss it with your fianc\u00e9e and had her talk to her niece.", "Your intentions were obviously good, and I can't call you an AH, but it is a really sensitive subject best approached by a female.", "YTA that\u2019s just not a conversation a man should be having with a child. Particularly when the child\u2019s mother is out of commission. That\u2019s aunties job - unless there isn\u2019t one but there is so. Should\u2019ve let your partner handle it and left the laundry alone.\n\nAnd yeah at 12, it\u2019s pretty traumatizing for an adult man to comment your periods.", "YTA -- u/InfamousSky2908 \\- Based on the INFO post below and in respect of differences, some 12yr old girls may have been receptive and others would slowly die inside being directed by an Uncle on what to do with her pads.  In her mind she did what was right; what her mom taught her to do. You got a chewing because mom was insulted by you and daughter was likely deeply embarrassed. There was also confusion as to why her uncle would tell her something different than her mom regarding a deeply personal topic.  \nChallenge yourself: How can your actions and words enhance or hinder a 12 yr old whose life has been toppled with mom in the hospital and rehab. Adults have the luxury to take a breath, strategize (its not an emergency) and decide the Aunt addressing the situation could be best. OK, it may not be best but why not create the best potential outcome.  \\~ \\~ From an adult whose family took me in when my mom was hospitalized around 12yr. Thank you! My mom, the rock who was never ill, was suddenly gone/ill. I would tear up at things that normally would not phase me. They may be a difficult time for her.

Girls so embarrassed she\u2019s staying elsewhere now - exactly what she needs when her moms in recovery, more instability.", "I understand why you think that. \n\nI also think this is a fuzzy boundary.", "It would have been embarrassing regardless of who told her.
