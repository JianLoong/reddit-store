She comes from a family with two sisters, her very involved mother and her father who isn\u2019t really that involved (he lives out of state). My fianc\u00e9e is a SAHM, the middle sister has a husband, no kids but is seemingly married to her career. The eldest, is a single mother to a 12 year old girl. She\u2019s not very self sufficient, but I\u2019ll get into that in a minute. \n\nCouple weeks ago the eldest sister was involved in an accident at work. She\u2019s had three separate surgeries and is now in a rehab facility for an unknown amount of time while she recovers. After the accident, our niece came to live with us. Basically my fianc\u00e9e and her mom have been up to their necks trying to sort through this sister\u2019s affairs. Everything is a mess, from her house to her finances.\n\nAnyways, every day after I get home from work my fianc\u00e9e and her mom are off to go tend to the sister and/or her colossal amount of problems. Few nights ago while getting dinner going for the kids, I asked my niece to bring the bathroom hamper downstairs. Our daughter has her own bathroom which she now shares with her cousin. It wasn\u2019t a thing we thought about so they both ended up using the same hamper. \n\nThe hamper was full and my niece had more dirty clothes on her bedroom floor. I began sorting the laundry as she went back upstairs to collect the rest. To my utter shock, I found 3 pairs of her underwear that had pads attached. When she got to the laundry room she saw them set aside. My exact words were, \u201cHon, you need to peel the pads off and throw them away before tossing your underwear in the dirty pile.\u201d \n\nHer response was simple, \u201cMy mom takes care of that.\u201d I was kind of like\u2026.\u2019wat?\u2019 Because the pads were beyond full I asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you change your pads out a couple times throughout the day?\u201d Her response, \u201cNo.\u201d Suddenly it occurred to me, I had smelled something off color the previous day after picking her up from school. Of course, I wasn\u2019t going to point that out to her. But I did tell her that you\u2019re supposed to change and discard the pads in the trash multiple times a day, especially when you wake up in the morning. \n\nObviously I upset her because she took a pile of her clothes and threw them on the floor, then stormed off to her room. She wouldn\u2019t come back down for dinner either. While cleaning up, I get a call from my niece\u2019s mother. \u201cWho do you think you are speaking to my daughter about her period?\u201d She completely went off on me saying I was so far out of line for not only embarrassing her child but putting her in an uncomfortable situation because I\u2019m a male. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t hear me out at all, I had to hang up because my fianc\u00e9e was calling. I explained every to her and her mom to which they said what I did was fine. She requested her mom take her daughter seeing that I\u2019ve now traumatized her. That\u2019s not even possible though, so as it stands right now the kid won\u2019t speak to me per her mother\u2019s instructions.", "created_utc": 1684446327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lbvba/aita_for_having_a_menstruation_hygiene_talk_with/", "score": 367, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because of this, we took our niece in while her mother recovers. One evening I was doing the kid\u2019s laundry and discovered 3 pairs of underwear that had menstruation pads still attached. I spoke to my niece about it, and told her the proper hygiene of using them. Her mother has said that was extremely inappropriate of me. She claimed I caused her daughter embarrassment and put her in an uncomfortable situation. Because I\u2019ve always been super close with my sister, and that 90% of my friends are female, I didn\u2019t think it was wrong in the moment. I saw an issue that needed to be corrected. But I\u2019ve now realized since she\u2019s not my daughter, I might be the AH for saying something. I should have maybe waited to bring it up to my fianc\u00e9e and let her handle it.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Feminine hygiene is important, and it is absolutely NOT normal to wear the same pad all day like you described. And the fact that the pad wasn\u2019t disposed of is gross.\n\nETA: I just noticed at the end that you said you were male, and I just want to say that being male doesn\u2019t matter. You are just looking out for your niece, and being rightfully concerned over her health.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re taking care of this kid, and it sounds like she either wasn\u2019t taught properly or didn\u2019t understand what she was taught. \n\nI think you handled it very well. \n\nHer mother\u2026not so much.", "NTA. Firstly, you were the one doing the laundry. It would've been JUST AS AWKWARD if you told your wife and then she spoke to your neice, because your neice would still know that you know - and that adds a layer of weird due to the game of telephone in the middle. Secondly, in your house, *disposable menstrual products don't go in the laundry*, that's a \"your house, your rules\" thing clearly. (Though TBH it's kinda nasty that some houses don't have that rule...)\n\nThe only AH here is your SIL/your neice's mom for not giving her the right info about how to deal with her period to begin with. I can't imagine how often she's had to wipe blood off a pad that just can't absorb any more because her mom lied to her about how frequently to change your pads. She's responsible for the confusion and embarassment.\n\nOP, since your SIL has suggested the issue is that you're male, you should also talk to your wife about talking to your neice other period stuff--like wrapping the pad in TP after she peels it off before she throws it in the trash.", "NTA, not even a little.

Of her mother isn\u2019t going to teach her proper hygiene, someone has to. I don\u2019t think this was so bad. Maybe a little embarrassing for a 12 year old but better to learn now that\u2019s being called out at school for being the stinky girl. That would be traumatic. You were not saying this in front of a group of people and hopefully she will understand what you said before too long. Maybe your fianc\u00e9e can give her a more detailed talk?", "NTA. You were doing the laundry and got slapped in the face with dirty pads. That\u2019s gross and she does need to know the things you told her. Her mom needs to do better.", "NTA\nThis is a problem that will harm her socially, due to the smell, and physically, because of the health problems it can cause.", "Nta your sil sounds honestly concerning and I feel real secondhand embarrassment for your niece for being in that situation at all.", "NTA. I'll confess, when I saw you are a man and just the fianc\u00e9e of this girl's aunt, my immediate reaction was NO, you are not the person to have a period conversation with a teen girl.  That said, this topic arose really naturally (you were sorting the laundry together), she didn't seem shocked or embarrassed when you came across the pads, and you limited your talk to \"please change and throw these away in the future.\" \n\nMy guess is that her mom was freaking out because she was caught teaching her daughter bad habits just to save a few bucks on pads. It's unfortunate you're being called a bad guy when all you've done is help her out.", "NTA it's natural for her to be embarrassed. But... she was expecting you to clean and dispose of her days old used pads without a second thought. You were not out of line to Inform her that isn't hygienic. If she wanted to not talk about period hygiene with you, she should have cleaned up after herself. She's 12. She knows where the trash is.", "NTA. You should not have to touch that and it wasn't like you sought her out. She came into the room. She might be embarrassed but the people saying she is traumatized must never have went through real trauma. You didn't even go into detail, just told her some proper hygiene.

That is a health and hygiene issue that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. She\u2019s a young girl and likely embarrassed so is blaming you.

It would\u2019ve been incompetent of you to just ignore it.", "NTA. This is an issue of hygiene. You were doing what was necessary. I suspect your niece may be embarrassed. Also, in what world does your sister think that this is acceptable?", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. This sort of thing can lead to infections and she needs to learn about them. Especially as she won't be living when she finds a place of her own, and more importantly now whilst your SIL is recovering.\n\nYour SIL is the AH. She shouldn't have gone off on you, especially as you are taking care of her daughter. I understand that is a bit embarrassing to talk to a man about these issues (periods and all) but its 100% normal. I think your SIL just doesn't want her daughter to grow up.", "NTA. your poor niece. being taught the wrong things and then being embarrassed. while it would\u2019ve been good to tell your wife first and let her talk to her about it, because sometimes it\u2019s just easier when it\u2019s woman to woman and she may have felt a little less embarrassed, it\u2019s better that it was a family member who talked about it to her instead of being bullied later in school for smelling bad. plus, stopping this behavior and teaching her the right way may have potentially saved her from any infection or irritation, it\u2019s not good to be sitting in a very full pad of blood for hours to whole days. you were just looking out for her and trying to help a problem that definitely needed to be addressed", "NTA. Honestly, I think you handled it well. You didn\u2019t yell at her or humiliate her, you simply explained how she was supposed to take care of it. I cannot freaking BELIEVE that her mother didn\u2019t teach her that and is just letting her throw her underwear in with the pads still attached?? Like she didn\u2019t teach her how to take them off and wrap them up and put them in the garbage? Wow. She is really doing her daughter a disservice and there was no woman home to talk to her. And honestly, I know men who probably would have avoided it and had their wife talk to her later. I don\u2019t thing you did anything wrong.", "NTA - this is something she needs to know for hygiene and health. If you could smell something, so could kids at school. This will be down to personal belief I guess - but I think a man having this conversation with her frankly and without fuss is actually setting a very healthy precedent about periods not being some taboo \u2018secret\u2019 that men must be sheltered from. Maybe the follow up conversation should come from both you and aunt, as she\u2019s clearly embarrassed and that\u2019s not her fault, but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA that poor girl is just walking around with a full pad for the entirety of her period? If her mother has such a problem with you giving her daughter the proper advice about her period then she should have done it. It's borderline neglect.", "NTA but I seriously urge you to ensure that child does not go back into her care. Leaving used pads in her clothes, not changing pads-- these are pretty serious hygiene and health issues. If her mom doesn't think they're a problem, and the kid is already this mad and defensive at such a young age, there's something wrong in that house.", "NTA. She needed to hear that pads need to be changed multiple times and she risks harming herself unintentionally. Just because you\u2019re a man doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t say something to her.", "NTA. As a woman your advice was correct. Even if you are a man, the girl\u2019s mom is a woman and not advising her correctly!", "'traumatize' what an easy word to use, ppl should stop using every damn word for everything, there is no trauma here, I'm really tired on some people.

I\u2019m not going to deny that. \n\nHowever\u2026while I understand that your heart was in the right place, having been a young girl myself once I\u2019d have been mortified if one of my uncles had had this type of conversation with me.

Particularly when the child\u2019s mother is out of commission. That\u2019s aunties job - unless there isn\u2019t one but there is so. Should\u2019ve let your partner handle it and left the laundry alone.\n\nAnd yeah at 12, it\u2019s pretty traumatizing for an adult man to comment your periods.", "YTA -- u/InfamousSky2908 \\- Based on the INFO post below and in respect of differences, some 12yr old girls may have been receptive and others would slowly die inside being directed by an Uncle on what to do with her pads.  In her mind she did what was right; what her mom taught her to do. You got a chewing because mom was insulted by you and daughter was likely deeply embarrassed. There was also confusion as to why her uncle would tell her something different than her mom regarding a deeply personal topic.  \nChallenge yourself: How can your actions and words enhance or hinder a 12 yr old whose life has been toppled with mom in the hospital and rehab. Adults have the luxury to take a breath, strategize (its not an emergency) and decide the Aunt addressing the situation could be best. OK, it may not be best but why not create the best potential outcome.  \\~ \\~ From an adult whose family took me in when my mom was hospitalized around 12yr. Thank you! My mom, the rock who was never ill, was suddenly gone/ill. I would tear up at things that normally would not phase me. They may be a difficult time for her.

Whatever the case, make sure she is well-stocked with her own supply of menstrual products while living with you, and tell her she can go to her guidance counselor at school if it's hard to keep enough pads stocked at home.

It is super weird that her mother expects that.", "NTA you were right to correct her and the way something is de-stigmatized is having these types of talks with everyone. It isn\u2019t just an female thing, periods should be talked about openly.", "NTA haha wtf", "NTA at all. Periods are nothing to be ashamed of, they are natural. It's good that you, as a male, were so open about period hygiene, as it shows your niece that it's normal to discuss these issues with men as well as women. Your SIL is currently stressed out due to her current health situation, which explains why she went off at you (she's probably wanted to vent about SOMETHING to SOMEONE for a while) but it doesn't excuse how she's effectively villified you and spurred on her daughter to not open up to males about periods.\n\nI know it's easier said than done, but please don't feel guilty about the situation. Between period hormones, worrying about her mother's health and being uprooted from her own home... your niece is in a confused place in life right now. Don't give up on her. She's lucky to have you.", "NTA. that sounds so scary for her. it's not your fault if she isn't being raised and taught properly.\nleaving used pads in your underwear without changing is very uncomfortable and can even be dangerous. she needs to know how to dispose of them properly, and i think it's better that you told her ASAP instead of telling your fianc\u00e9e or her family members first, which i think would spread the info further and cause more embarrassment.\nthe fact that her mother is now forbidding her from speaking to you seems like a red flag to me. does she WANT her daughter to be unhygienic and unsafe with her menstruation products? judging by your other comments, that woman needs some serious therapy before she can go back to being a parent...", "NTA. This is not only disgusting and unhygienic but dangerous. \n 1) she can develop rashes from sitting in her own blood \n2) she can get infections from sitting in her own blood \n3) you know her fellow kids will notice the smell of something rotting whenever she is around during her period. They are going to comment and some will mock her. \n4) what happens if she starts to use tampons? You can DIE if you leave them in to long. There are a number of girls/young women who die every year from  Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) because they left tampons in too long. \n\nI can understand why a 12 year old wouldn\u2019t want to talk with a male. There is nothing wrong with a male helping and explaining but at that age most girls would be incredibly embarrassed. Hell when I was 15 i was still embarrassed to check out with pads and tampons if there was a boy around my age at checkout. But she needs to have a serious discussion with someone on feminine hygiene. \n\n\nAnd yes I know it\u2019s not just blood that is expelled from the body.", "NTA. \n\nI get lazy when I menstruate and wear the same underwear for 3-4 days at a time, but I change them if they get stained and you BET I change my pad. \n\nI don't understand why she won't tell her daughter to change her pads? Is she just... Sitting... In all the blood?\n\nThis is borderline neglect. If she did this with a tampon she would probably be dead or hospitalized with toxic shock syndrome. NTA.", "NTA someone had to and she'd have done her job it wouldn't have been down to you. It's a shame she was embarrassed but the answer is more communicating and finding a balance between giving her space and giving her support. Not her mum shutting it down on petty pathetic basis.\nBut if your schools are like ours some teacher could find this out as well - so easy to leak at that age and that is without the required xhange after a few hours - and have to report it as neglect at home or something.\nEither way you have not done anything wrong and actually handled it with better grace than a lot of people would have done.", "NTA", "NTA.... But she might need to hear this again from someone she listens too.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know why this child was never made aware that changing pads is a thing and that mommy won\u2019t remove them for her.

It doesn't do anyone any favours and serious problems go unspoken about and get missed. It's bonkers to me that it's people my age pulling this shit now because even though I still have that shame, I would never want any children of mine to be.", "Not just that, we need to teach young girls and young boys about periods so that those boys can support their sisters and girlfriends.

Or that girl only get their period when they are having sex.", "i suppose so, but when was this suppose to be addressed? or rather, what solution would you have suggested op do? \n\nid be worried, because its not just unhygienic, but wearing a bloody pad all day can lead to infections, and from how the mom has yet to teach the daughter the proper way to handle pads, what would happen for the daughter to get a infection/yeast infection?\n\ni understand at 12, i was wary of sharing my period problems, but id rather someone who is still an adult in my life to tell me certain things, cause truly, the mom is not teaching her daughter within the best interest", "Honestly, being that she was not my relative, I would have had the partner handle it. If nothing else, I would not have asked her about her normal period habits. At most, I'd have just told her what's normal. Which he did. Just minus that middle question.\n\nI am willing to admit that I might be projecting but I would not want any connection between myself and an unrelated little girl's nethers. Especially while alone and unsupervised. CYA at all times.\n\nI can also see that middle question feeling like a \"omg you're gross\" accusation. Again, projecting, but I was a 12 year old girl once.", "I can see where she would be uncomfortable talking to a man about it, but I can't see where he was wrong at all, and his sex has nothing to do with it.", "i didnt see the middle question as gross, rather just to affirm himself if thats really whats happening, being that she doesnt change her pad through-out the day which can be bad for her health, im just glad its not tampon territory because leaving those in for 12+ hours can cause much more trouble than a pad\n\ni can also see your point of view, but i think he asked in the moment than really let those thoughts cross his mind, yknow?\n\nbut i can understand where youre coming from now, but i think worry of the child is most important in the situation at hand, and i just hope she learns to be careful with pads and other period products", ">I can see where she would be uncomfortable talking to a man about it,   \n>  \n>... and his sex has nothing to do with it.\n\nI'm not sure how you can say both of those things honestly.  \nI agree that he did nothing *wrong.*", "It means that I can see how she could feel uncomfortable, but he's not wrong just because she's uncomfortable. He didn't know when he saw her dirty pads in the clothes basket that she would be uncomfortable with him saying something.", "Right...I'm looking at different comments. You say you could understand where she would be uncomfortable talking *to a man* about it but \\*his sex (\\*that being \"a man\") has nothing to do with it.\n\nEither it does or it doesn't.

NTA.", "NTA holy shit\n\nOP, have you considered suggesting she try menstrual underwear instead? I think that might be an easy solution", "NTA\nShe would have been embarrassed regardless of who told her. Because her mother did her a huge disservice and not only didn't teach her, but also made it somehow a taboo thing that men aren't supposed to know about. \n\nThe sister is latching on to you being a male to cover for herself and her neglect of her daughter. If she can misdirect the issue to being a you problem, she hopes it will go away and nobody will ask her why her daughter isn't learning basic hygiene at home.", "NTA.\n\nWho are you to talk about it with her?

This is...not normal.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, OP...you are SO NTA.", "NTA\n\nHer mother has dropped the ball in a huge way if that poor child doesn't know that pads are meant to be changed several times a day and doesn't know how to properly dispose of them.  I am sad that she felt embarrassed but that's 100% on her mother. \n\nBesides all of that, there's the issue of the potential for damage to her clothes,  your daughter's clothes and your laundry machines AND the hygienic & aesthetic problems of leaving used menstrual products just lying around. Menstrual fluid is not shameful or \"dirty\" but leaving it to decay is unsanitary and nobody,  especially your 6 year old child,  should have to deal with that.", "I would try to talk to your niece. Tell her that it's dangerous to not switch pads.  If she has a phone tell her to set reminders at certain times of the day to change it.  Tell her that you did not want yo upset her but you care about her.  Tell her the risks of Infection if you don't c\nSwap pads. Maybe do a thing where every time she changes her pad she gets a reward till she learns. Because clearly she has never learned.  Baby steps. Maybe if her cousin is the same age then you could have her be a support for her. And your wife should be involved in this stuff as well.  Your doing your best.

If SILs finances are really a mess she may have been limiting her daughter to one pad a day, I've seen that happen once when a family was really broke.

You can\u2019t really go back and change it now, but I would get your wife to have the discussion with her. \u201cPads do need to be changed every couple hours or you could get sick.
