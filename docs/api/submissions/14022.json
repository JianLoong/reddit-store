How much of his money were you spending for your own pleasure before? Did he spend money on you? It doesn\u2019t seem like it. I don\u2019t understand how he could be furious that you put the inheritance in savings, either - is it a bank account he doesn\u2019t have access to or something? Either way, he seems pretty damn selfish. Buying *himself* a fancy car after your mom dies is at best a tone deaf move, even if he wasn\u2019t dumb enough to think you\u2019d cover it for him with your dead mother\u2019s money. \n\nBut I have to ask: how much discussion was had about finances before you initially moved in tougher?

Why was it okay for him to choose money over marriage but not you?  And you lost your mother!  I'd lose it off my husband went car shopping the day after her funeral.  You need to think about whether this is who/how you want to spend the rest of your life with.  If you have children, it will get even worse.\n\nYou also need to check that prenup again to make sure this inheritance is 100% protected.", "NTA", "NTA - ANd it's your HUBAND who is chosing money over your marriage.  He's the one who wanted a prenup.  ALSO make sure he can't touch a cent of that inheritance.  You often can't but if you accidentalyl comingle it then oops he gets it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think you shoudl get divorced now. He's obviously a controlling, inconsiderate asshole.  He wanted his money, and didn't want to share.  Now you ahve  money, he wants your money (to share).", "Nta he asked for 50 50 when he was the one on the up then as soon as its you he wants you covering 100 to 0 that's craziness", "NTA!! Choose the money, loose the husband.", "NTA, you are not costing money over your husband, but you\u2019re leaving someone who values money over your grief. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. But look at the situation from an outsiders perspective and would you ever recommend somebody else to stay with the person who has treated them the way your husband has. \nIt clearly shows from his behaviour that he is very money minded and has no value for humans and their feelings. \nInstead of supporting you in your loss he was busy celebrating his \u2018win/lottery\u2019. \nI hope you heed the advice give here and find yourself a good lawyer and amazing friends since going through this loss can and will be hard. May be even a grief counsellor or some family members.", "Rules for thee but not for me. Hell no, most definitely NTA. So sorry for your loss. I know the feeling. I would give everything I inherited from my dad back to get one more hug. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your husband really loves you. I think this is a sign that it\u2019s time for you to explore your freedom. \n\nLook at the inheritance as compensation for your grief, go get that killer attorney, and enjoy the rest of your life. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what your mom would want.", "Fun fact: generally inheritance is not marital property in the US. Continue to keep all assets separate, and go get a killer divorce attorney, OP.", "Candidly if one of your parents dies and the first thing your spouse does is buy a car while your in the midst of grief.  Fuck the payment arrangement and get the hell out of there.  She needs to find the best divorce lawyer and run for the hills and find someone who cares.  She deserves way way way better.", "Vile word vomit!!! Perfect", "Completely NTA. He didn't pay proportional to his assets when it was in your favor, so why should you start doing it now? Be glad you have a prenup and separate finances. That money is yours and he doesn't get to spend it. He can spend his own money. I'm sorry to hear your mom died. Take your time to process that. You don't need to do anything with the money now. And stay strong on this. He doesn't get to demand that you share after he has refused to for several years.", "Oh and you did NOT choose money over your husband, you chose maintaining pre existing boundaries over indulging a large frivolous purchase that HE made WITHOUT CONSULTING YOU but still EXPECTING YOU TO PAY FOR and his attempt to turn that back on you is a flag for mental abuse.", "Yep, plus he's committing financial infidelity.  Some states admit that in a divorce for cause IIRC.", "Also that! Yes take your money and GTFO."]}
