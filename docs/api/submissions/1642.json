{"id": 1642, "submission_id": "ynyp2z", "title": "AITA for taking back the Goat that I bought for my ex-boyfriend's family?", "selftext": "My ex (34M) and I (32F) were dating for a little over two years. We met while we were in college, and then reconnected again years later, which is when we started to date.\n\nMy ex, Adam, and I were All-in since the start. One thing he'd made clear time and again was that his family's approval meant the world to him, and if he didn't get their approval for our relationship, then he'd have to end things. It's something I've always been concerned about in the back of my head. But since his family lived in another country, it was never really an active thought.\n\nSince the last few months, we'd been actively revisiting the topic of getting married. So, once we came to the decision that we wanted to get married, our next logical step was to visit his family to get their approval.\n\nUpon reaching there, Adam suggested that I buy a goat for his family, as visiting someone empty handed was rude - and that the goat could also help us with his mother's final answer.  We went to the market, picked the goat, paid, and left.\n\nAt his family house, I was immediately greeted in an extremely cold manner. It almost felt as if they were only tolerating my presence there. His family consists of his mother, his sister and her husband. The sister spoke a bit of English, but the mother didn't - so most of my communication with Adam's mother happened via Adam or Adam's sister.\n\nAdam told his mother that he wanted to marry me and that he had come to seek her approval. She flat-out refused and basically said that she'd rather watch him spend his life single than permit him to marry me. She basically wants him to marry someone from their own community, because him marrying someone outside his community would affect her social standing.\n\nI was asked to leave by his sister, and Adam was asked to return after dropping me to the cab. While leaving, I started to untie the goat to take him along with me. His sister immediately asked me what I was doing, and I told her that I was taking the goat back since I didn't get the approval. She was baffled by this, and Adam told me that I was embarrassing him. I didn't quite understand how was it not fair to take back the goat when it didn't even help with the reason I bought him in the first place?\n\nAdam seemed really pissed and said he was disappointed in me. He said he was done and left without even dropping me to the cab. I tried to call him after getting to the hotel, but he hasn't answered any of my calls.\n\nI'm not sure why would he think I would've been okay with giving a gift that expensive just to get treated coldly and not even get the approval of the family.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:  I had to return the goat :( There was a brief moment when I thought of keeping him, but it wasn't practical at all. I have no idea how I'd travel back home with a goat. So I just returned the goat to the market guy and got half the money back.

Stop contacting him, he's not worth it.", "OP, this can\u2019t possibly be the first time mommy told him he could only marry a local girl. He knew going in that mommy wasn\u2019t going to approve. He is going to keep dating and sleeping with women. Telling them what they want to hear. Then, when mommy finds his bride. He will be running back like the good little boy that he is.", "Nta. You were not initiated into the customs of your bfs culture\u2026 something he is 100% responsible for teaching you.

Keep the goat, ditch the Adam.", "NTA the whole point of the goat was to help pave the way for you to have a positive interaction with his family. Clearly their mind was already made up and Adam knew that before bringing you. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Adam expected you to keep trying and gifting them with things.

Dodged a bullet there.  Wondering how many other women he\u2019s brought to visit his mother and brought a host with them.  \n\nHow horrible for you.  I hope you get to go home soon. Nothing there for you either boyfriend.", "This is the best post in the history of AITA.  \n\nNTA, but I\u2019m seriously interested in the fate of the goat, the boyfriend, his mom, the whole thing.  I\u2019m sure you dodged a bullet.", "INFO: when you say \"same community\" do you actually mean \"same skin colour\", because this whole story screams \"Racist Family\" to me.", "Info: what is the custom in this community? \n\nIf this is a host gift, YTA.\n\nIf this was sort of a dowry \"here's a goat\" thing, and you didn't get the approval,  then take the fuvking goat back is NTA.\n\nI'm really sorry that you spent so much time with this person only to have your hopes of marriage dashed by the mother's disapproval. This all really sounds like a really awful situation.", "NAH. As far as I can see, the goat was a gift, not a price paid for approval. The goat belonged to Adam's mom at that point, and taking it back was theft.\n\nBut you're angry. Adam had warned you that his family's approval was essential, and you didn't receive that approval. So all the bridges have been burned anyway. Assuming that nobody calls the police because of the theft, there's little lost in taking back the goat.\n\nI can see it now: you and the goat sharing the back seat of a taxi.\n\nAre you going to use the goat for its meat, or are you going to keep it as a pet?", "NTA I would leave this man. What kind of adult man needs his mother\u2019s approval to marry", "I took it back to the market and got half the money back.", "I would like to know too!\n\nAlso, the next time someone says they will dump you purely because their family doesn't approve, you should move on.", "At this point it's all about the goat. Did the goat go to the hotel? Where is the goat.", "It kinda makes me wonder how many other free goats he and his mother have grifted off of other rejectees.", "I had to return the goat :( There was a brief moment when I thought of keeping him, but it wasn't practical at all. I have no idea how I'd travel back home with a goat. So, I just cut my losses and returned the goat to the market guy.", "NTA this was my thought also. In the future find someone that isn't trying to enrich his family's standing at your expense.\n\nI'm unsure what culture he is in, but usually marriage gifts are dependent on a marriage.  If this wasn't the case it was your  boyfriends job to explain things fully prior to that stage. If you made an opps you were misinformed  so not your fault at all. \n\nForget that guy since he's rude not to explain things properly and allowing people to be mean to you.", "Yeah. Dowry stuff is valid in some places. But they need explanations prior to getting to that stage. So all parties know in advance. Op wasn't informed and was left in a situation that seemed like extortion due to lack of information.  Totally rude of that family to do.", "I was thinking small eastern European village. But could be Africa or Middle East even. Even Asia in general.", "Could be just as well about religion (or caste) as about race. A strictly Muslim family would likely not be enthusiastic about a Hindu SIL; neither the other way around - even if both are from the same race or even same country.", "\"host gift\" where the host kicks the giver out after 1 look at them? You gift your host to thank them for their hospitality. There was no hospitality - dude's family should be ashamed.\n\nNTA.", "To be a host gift the host has to host.  Sounds like host didn't allow op through the door. So wasn't hosted. \n\nSo no host gift needed.", "What other reason would her son have brought home a woman with a goat except to get a marriage approval? You don't accept a gift, knowing that you will be kicking the gifter out of your house. It was basically a set-up. I wonder how many other women Adam has brought home bearing a goat to meet his Mom. \n\nOP, was there a herd of goats at Mom's house? \n\nI mean really, if this is actually true, OP got played so hard. Taking the goat back was the perfect revenge and totally deserved.", "She took it back to the market", "The goat wasn\u2019t a gift from her heart.

Because if so, I think we know how they got them.", ">OP, was there a herd of goats at Mom's house?\n\nThere were 3 goats and a few chickens there. I remember feeling so happy that my goat will have company and won't be alone.", "Her motive was to get a marriage approval, but the gift wasn't a payment for that (or it wouldn't have been a gift).", "That's too bad. I was starting to visualize her bonding with the goat, and taking it through airport security.", "... in the same way that a fishing license is required to catch fish. It won't get you the fish.

It was the best one there and was a bit of a Chonk, which the guy said was a great thing. Although I can't tell for sure if that is the rate there. I'm sure the prices were hiked because I was a tourist.", "Lmfao that was also the ending I had hoped for", "That's about average for the US also.", "NTA. I think I want to marry you. No goat required. Adam was free to pay you for the goat so his family could keep it. Since he wasn't going to marry you anyway without his family's approval, who cares if he's \"disappointed\"? \n\nOMG I am in love with the image of you swanning off with your goat.", "YTA this is a 90 day fianc\u00e9 episode\u2026", "NTA - the goat probably had more backbone than Adam.", "NTA: since his mother did not approve of the marriage, she no longer had need of the goat.

Hopefully you'll find someone not so tied down by their culture next time who doesn't have a racist mom.", "It's an elaborate long-con goat acquisition scheme.", "I don\u2019t have a son but if I did would totally trade him for a good fat nanny goat. A daughter is worth a good fat cow or 200lbs of processed venison, though. \n\nMy friends think I\u2019m weird for having decided this even though I\u2019m childfree.", "Do you think she'd find a willing buyer?

Hope Kimbahlly got her money back.", "I think it is more about the dating and sex he can get with promises of a future together. Then, when mommy doesn\u2019t give her blessing.
