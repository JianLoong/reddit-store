We met while we were in college, and then reconnected again years later, which is when we started to date.\n\nMy ex, Adam, and I were All-in since the start. One thing he'd made clear time and again was that his family's approval meant the world to him, and if he didn't get their approval for our relationship, then he'd have to end things. It's something I've always been concerned about in the back of my head. But since his family lived in another country, it was never really an active thought.\n\nSince the last few months, we'd been actively revisiting the topic of getting married. So, once we came to the decision that we wanted to get married, our next logical step was to visit his family to get their approval.\n\nUpon reaching there, Adam suggested that I buy a goat for his family, as visiting someone empty handed was rude - and that the goat could also help us with his mother's final answer.  We went to the market, picked the goat, paid, and left.\n\nAt his family house, I was immediately greeted in an extremely cold manner. It almost felt as if they were only tolerating my presence there. His family consists of his mother, his sister and her husband. The sister spoke a bit of English, but the mother didn't - so most of my communication with Adam's mother happened via Adam or Adam's sister.\n\nAdam told his mother that he wanted to marry me and that he had come to seek her approval. She flat-out refused and basically said that she'd rather watch him spend his life single than permit him to marry me. She basically wants him to marry someone from their own community, because him marrying someone outside his community would affect her social standing.\n\nI was asked to leave by his sister, and Adam was asked to return after dropping me to the cab. While leaving, I started to untie the goat to take him along with me. His sister immediately asked me what I was doing, and I told her that I was taking the goat back since I didn't get the approval. She was baffled by this, and Adam told me that I was embarrassing him. I didn't quite understand how was it not fair to take back the goat when it didn't even help with the reason I bought him in the first place?\n\nAdam seemed really pissed and said he was disappointed in me. He said he was done and left without even dropping me to the cab. I tried to call him after getting to the hotel, but he hasn't answered any of my calls.\n\nI'm not sure why would he think I would've been okay with giving a gift that expensive just to get treated coldly and not even get the approval of the family.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:  I had to return the goat :( There was a brief moment when I thought of keeping him, but it wasn't practical at all. I have no idea how I'd travel back home with a goat. So I just returned the goat to the market guy and got half the money back.

As far as I can see, the goat was a gift, not a price paid for approval. The goat belonged to Adam's mom at that point, and taking it back was theft.\n\nBut you're angry. Adam had warned you that his family's approval was essential, and you didn't receive that approval. So all the bridges have been burned anyway. Assuming that nobody calls the police because of the theft, there's little lost in taking back the goat.\n\nI can see it now: you and the goat sharing the back seat of a taxi.\n\nAre you going to use the goat for its meat, or are you going to keep it as a pet?", "NTA I would leave this man.

In the future find someone that isn't trying to enrich his family's standing at your expense.\n\nI'm unsure what culture he is in, but usually marriage gifts are dependent on a marriage.  If this wasn't the case it was your  boyfriends job to explain things fully prior to that stage. If you made an opps you were misinformed  so not your fault at all. \n\nForget that guy since he's rude not to explain things properly and allowing people to be mean to you.", "Yeah. Dowry stuff is valid in some places. But they need explanations prior to getting to that stage. So all parties know in advance. Op wasn't informed and was left in a situation that seemed like extortion due to lack of information.  Totally rude of that family to do.", "I was thinking small eastern European village. But could be Africa or Middle East even. Even Asia in general.", "Could be just as well about religion (or caste) as about race.

So wasn't hosted. \n\nSo no host gift needed.", "What other reason would her son have brought home a woman with a goat except to get a marriage approval? You don't accept a gift, knowing that you will be kicking the gifter out of your house. It was basically a set-up. I wonder how many other women Adam has brought home bearing a goat to meet his Mom. \n\nOP, was there a herd of goats at Mom's house? \n\nI mean really, if this is actually true, OP got played so hard.

Because if so, I think we know how they got them.", ">OP, was there a herd of goats at Mom's house?\n\nThere were 3 goats and a few chickens there.

Way to stand up for yourself, rude people don\u2019t get to keep expensive presents that you literally just got them.

If such a thing exists anyway.", "INFO: I know you had a lot going on at the time and getting photographs probably wasn't your top priority, but please do you have a picture of the goat?", "NTA. Might just be me but you should get that $100 back from the ex. Seems like the problem was the ex\u2019s to solve. He should have paid for the goat.", "NTA - this is so bad-ass\n\nNo play-no pay", "NTA, not sure why his opinion matters anymore since he was going to dump you like mommy wanted.", "NTA, I wonder how the family got those other 3 goats, maybe those girls didn't have the sense to return them.\n\nHopefully this helped you realize that your ex was not worth it. He was an ass about the whole process and basically told you from the start his family means more to him than you and that they would probably force him to do whatever they want him to. I wouldn't want to be with someone like that.\n\nIf I was in your husband's shoes I would 100% be buying the goat myself and having you tell the family it's a gift from you. The fact he forced you to pay for the goat is a another strike against him for me.", "ESH\nA gift is a gift, not a payment. If your partner is from another culture you should find out from him ahead of time about cultural expectations like this. Also, why did you have to buy the goat and not your bf? Bf should have bought the goat, mother and sister shouldn\u2019t have been AHs, and bf should have managed the situation so much better.", "YTA. The goat was supposed to be an offering. Taking it back is the very definition of embarrassing yourself and your SO. A gift is a gift. \n\nEssentially you let it be known it was a bribe, and you weren't asking for their blessing at all, you were demanding it.", "NTA. But, OP, cut this guy off on everything.
