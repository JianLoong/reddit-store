Not one single soul has a good relationship with him. He thinks he's more important than others and is the most disrespectful person you'll ever meet.\n\nHe has one brother(my uncle) who has a wife(the aunt in this story). Let's call her \"K\". They have one daughter who's five years younger than me, let's call her \"Jenny\". \n\nBetween when I was 8-10 years old, my sperm donor would take me to my paternal grandma's house. Whenever we would go there, the uncle, K, and Jenny would show up as well. K knows my sperm donor isn't a good person and clearly she doesn't like him. But instead of taking it up with him, she would always take it out on me. Yes, a grown adult bullying a child because she doesn't have the balls to confront the asshole father.\n\nShe would constantly treat me like I was the scum of the earth. She would slam doors in my face, give me the stink eye, and whenever I said something, she'd challenge me as though I was a full-fledged adult. Neither of my parents cared nor did they do anything.\n\nAs you can guess, she didn't like it if I tried to talk to Jenny(who was 3-5 at the time). I'll admit, I was dumb as a kid and couldn't read the room, so I would still try to play with my cousin. K would continue to be awful to me.\n\nSo anyway, we never went to my paternal grandma's place for a long time after that. However, she hasn't been doing well, so my sperm donor took my brother and I there a few weeks ago. K and Jenny were there too. I haven't seen them in a decade, and Jenny is 15 now. I'm not sure what her character is like. I'm sure her mother has tried to brainwash her into thinking that I'm a terrible person. But who knows? It is also true that kids don't always turn out like their parents. For all I know, Jenny could also be a very sweet girl and the complete opposite of her mom.\n\nThe thing is, even if Jenny is a good person, I know her mom still doesn't like me. Even if it was 10 years ago, her mom made it very clear that she didn't like me talking to Jenny. So now I know how to act around them. I pretty much kept to myself. I wasn't rude to Jenny or K, but I also didn't make an effort to talk to them. \n\nJust to be clear, I don't hate Jenny, she is innocent in all of this. I avoided talking to her because I wasn't in the mood to deal with her mother's obnoxious behavior.\n\nA few days in, K flipped out on me, saying that I was disrespectful to them. She says that sure, she may have mistreated me 10 years ago, but I'm grown now and am holding onto it for no reason. She claims that I am taking out my anger on Jenny. I essentially told her to fuck off.\n\nI didn't feel bad at first. But now I'm thinking, maybe I was an asshole to Jenny. She didn't do anything, probably doesn't remember what happened, and maybe she was wondering why I as the older cousin was ignoring her.

You literally did nothing wrong.\n\nK is still the same, attacking you. She's still using her daughter as well. \nIt's not your responsibility to repair the relationship(s) K's abusive behavior made toxic and distant. It's not your duty to somehow bypass K to develop a healthy relationship with your cousin, who is a minor and reliant on her parents.\n\nNotice how Ks complaints never reflect any responsibility on her part. No, she's \"offended\" by how you are, and you should fix that for her comfort. She's emotionally abusive. She wants her feelings, which only she can feel and regulate, to be the yardstick for others' behavior/obedience. So convenient when the only goalposts are the abuser's internal emotions. If you DID try to lower your boundaries, interact with them and cultivate a relationship with your cousin, you'd be engaging in a \"can't win\" relationship on your part. It would only bring you close enough for K, who hasn't acknowledged, apologized for, nor made any effort to correct or change her abusive behavior towards you, to pick up where she left off.\n\nThe people who push back hardest when you set boundaries (very correctly, on where YOU will and will not direct your time, attn, and resources) are the very ones for whom firm boundaries are needed.

Sorry. It sounds like you've had to struggle with a lot and you have my sympathies, but I would also think your experience would help you recognize that a child should not be judged by their parents. \n\nPresumably you don't want people to judge you or ignore your existence because your sperm donor is an AH, so I don't understand you would treat someone badly because you don't like their mother or because their mother treated you badly in the past. Your aunt might be a nasty person, but this was a time to use your words, at least.", "K was going to be mad at you no matter what you did. If you had talked to Jenny, K would be telling you to not talk to her child still. There is no winning with people like her.", "Honestly.

With K as her mother, Jenny has way worse problems to deal with.", "You could always reach out to Jenny and apologize for ignoring her and give her the details of why you didn't try to talk to her more. I'd bet K would love that.", "this!! now that you say, I think this is the case.", "Your comment would have been true if Jenny was an independent adult. However, she's only 15 at the moment and dependent on her parents. If the mom doesn't want OP talking to Jenny, then there's not much OP could do.\n\nSure, maybe it sucks to be in Jenny's shoes.
