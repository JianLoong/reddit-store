Despite being only a year apart in age, our daughters were completely different and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n\nMy daughter has always been athletic and outgoing. Growing up, she played basketball, softball, soccer, volleyball, and even golf. In middle school, she picked up tennis and never looked back. I paid for her to have private lessons and when she found out how much I was paying for those lessons, she decided that\u2019s what she wants to do as her teenage job. She\u2019s now a junior, is one of the best players on her HS team, and teaching tennis lessons. She teaches elementary school kids and charges $75 per hour per kid. With her skills and outgoing personality, she has a waiting list of kids and makes about $1,200 a week. She could make more but I limit her hours so that she can concentrate on school.\n\nMy stepdaughter is reserved and not very athletic. We always tried to sign her up to the same sport and team with my daughter but she either objected or quit a couple of weeks in. I get it, sports is not for everyone so I never made her feel bad about it. She recently turned 16 and got a job at a burger place nearby. She\u2019s making $13 an hour and brings home less than $200 a week. \n\nMy daughter recently decided that she wants to be independent by buying her clothes and electronics with her own money. Obviously she can afford the latest styles and gadgets. She recently brought herself the top of the line Mac. My stepdaughter is jealous of her sister and have been very vocal about it. \n\nWhile we were bed last night, my wife said it was unfair one is making so much more than the other. I answered that there\u2019s nothing we can do about it and it\u2019s a good life lesson for the girls. My wife then suggested we have my daughter use her money to help my stepdaughter buy the same things or we cover the pay difference between the girls. I laughed because I thought she was joking but she wasn\u2019t. We whisper argued for about an hour before we went to sleep. This morning she brought it up again and accused said I\u2019m refusing because I\u2019m playing favorites and that\u2019s an AH move for a parent. We argued until we had to leave for work.", "created_utc": 1696338792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yrll9/aita_for_refusing_to_making_sure_things_are_equal/", "score": 3288, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter has skills that are in demand and her salary reflects that.  Your stepdaughter is starting out on a typical student career path and her salary reflects that.  Forcing your daughter to fund your stepdaughter would be the height of unfairness.  Your wife needs to stop trying to turn your home into a crabpot and let her daughter figure out where her own talents lie.  \n\n\nMy BIL has a doctorate, with a well-paying job in his field, his wife is in high fashion, and they live a DINK life.  They are buying real estate in New York.  My husband and I are civil servants with children to raise.  According to your wife's ideas, my BIL should be sending me palimony checks every month to support my children, after all he's my husband's brother!  That's not life, and she would do a disservice to her daughter with her bad ideas.", "NTA\n\nStep daughter shouldn\u2019t benefit from her step-sisters hard work \u2018just because\u2019. \n\nYour wife is silly to even suggest that your daughter should have to pay for anything regarding her step sister. Outrageous to even think it, let alone say it out loud. \n\nYou\u2019re not playing favourites. If your wife gets her way all she will do is breed resentment from your daughter to her step sister.", "NTA - why would you punish one child to benefit the other?  It is a good lesson for both girls.  The one who makes less is learning she needs to learn valuable skills to pay for what she wants.  The one who makes more is reaping the benefits of consistent effort.  \n\n\nI do think you should look into getting your step daughter lessons in things that interest her, not just what her step-sister is doing.  Help her try some things out.  Maybe buy her a few things so she doesn't feel quite so left behind, but not as nice as what your other daughter is able to buy for herself.", "NTA - \n\nThis one is VERY cut and dry for me. Very. \n\nYour wife is asking you to both punish your daughter for her success, and to also reward her daughter for her (comparative) \u201ccomplacency\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s surprising your wife wouldn\u2019t be able to see how unfair that actually is. \n\nThere is no logical reason to force your daughter to share her (incredibly impressive) income with her stepsister imo. \n\nNow, your daughter has reaped the benefits of private tennis lessons but it sounds like that was the biggest \u201cleg up\u201d she was given. \n\nI can see you and your wife paying to give her daughter a similar leg up if she showed the interest, but ultimately both of these young women are sleeping in beds they\u2019ve made. \n\nYour wife is being entitled, and unreasonable. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with daughter\u2019s existing income. \n\nTreating her daughter the way she is suggesting now will do nothing but enforce and reward her crappy and jealous behavior. \n\nEdit: my phrasing was much too harsh in condemning OP\u2019s step daughter of complacency which wasn\u2019t fair. \n\nMade small language adjustments.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner wants to take money away from your daughter (Money that is hers, that she earned), and give it to her daughter, that's favoritism, it's not your daughter fault that her step-sibling makes less than her, and the step-sibling should learn to not aspire to spend more than what she can afford, your partner is setting up her daughter for failure as an adult.", "NTA but you will be if you go along with this by forcing your daughter to give her money to your stepdaughter or paying for your stepdaughter to buy the same stuff as your daughter. Honestly, your wife gets major side-eye just for the suggestion and from now on you need to be watching her behavior closely.", "Your wife and stepdaughter are not entitled to anyone\u2019s money except their own.

Crafts (think etsy), a new language, writing...anything. Obv paying with your/your wife's money, not your daughters!! The two girls haven't had the same opportunities growing up so I do think putting some effort into levelling the playing field is a good idea.", "NTA. I used to make money riding and training horses when I was a kid. I was told my \u201chobby\u201d was expensive so I had to buy my own gear. Fair enough! \n\nWhat was *unfair* was that my older brother had an expensive hobby but he couldn\u2019t monetize it through either talent or ability so my parents supported his hobby financially, fully funding it. \n\nI resented the fuck out of that. Why did they pay for him but not me? \n\nIf they had taken **my earnings** to subsidize his hobby or purchases I would have been so pissed. \n\nIt\u2019s not equality to make one sister pay for the other. It\u2019s not equitable, either. \n\nStep-daughter can get a better job or she can quit complaining. Life isn\u2019t fair and you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a good lesson to learn now.", "NTA. Your wife's daughter is not entitled to your child's money. Your wife can supplement her child, but she cannot steal from your daughter.  I can't imagine my parents saying that I was entitled to one of my sibling's incomes because I was jealous.", "Info: can you help her maybe get a better job? Is she good at her studies or anything else? Tutoring elementary kids can make her 50$ or plus an hour if she is good. \nI am never been sporty but I make the bank tutoring while in school.\nAlso as your daughter tennis lesson where so expensive (I know I have a kid doing it and 100$ is the minimum for a tennis teacher) did step daughter had the privilege or receiving equal financial help in cultivating whatever her hobby, passion is? It\u2019s not your daughter job to help her sister out, but it is parental duty to offer all kids equal opportunities and then let them put to fruition.", "NTA. Where is it playing favourits if your daughter is allowed to keep HER money, she owns with her job, while your step daughter doesn't. Sorry, but live is not fair and taking away the money of your daughter would only lead to her hating her stepsister, reducing her hours so she doesn't have to work to pay her sister and hiding her money. She has talent, she should be allowed to profit of it.\n\nYou might offer to pay for curses for your step daughter so she will be able to get a good job or teenage job as well - not sport but what she wants to do. But best teach her, to accept that others can earn more money and can use this money how they want. And to not be jelous. It is kind of childish to cry because sister is making more money and can afford more things.", "NTA\n\nMy sister is a lawyer making bank while I just started my career in IT recently. Like you daughter, my sister's much higher salary and pay in general is due to the work she put in on her own. She is now reaping the benefits and I am definitely not entitled to the same lifestyle she has just because we are siblings.", "NTA - in the future if your daughter only earns 50k a year and your step daughter 150k is your wife going to expect her child to give her step sister 50k to make it even or for her (your wife) to make it even? Nope because that\u2019s just plain stupid.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter has earn her own money so she can buy what she chooses. If your stepdaughter can't because she earns less, it's ok too. If she wants something, she should ask her mother to buy it, not her sister. And your wife should be understanding that her step-daughter can spends her money buying things for her, not for your stepchild.\n\nMaybe your step daughter is jeaulous of your daughter, like she has a good personality, she's good in sports... while your step daughter is not. You could try to speak to her about her feelings.", "Info: did you offer your stepdaughter the same opportunity to have private lessons in things she was actually interested in, or just sports?\n\nTreating them equally means equal opportunity, not equal outcome. You say you signed SD up for the same sports teams but that obviously isn't where her interest lies, meanwhile if she had an interest in art or music or tech and you made the same investment toward private lessons/equipment, she could have theoretically pursued those interests to the same results as your daughter has.\n\nYour wife is going about this wrong. But I feel saying n-t-a to this post also implies the daughter is entitled and hasn't worked hard in her own way which I can't agree with based on the info given. Your daughter is doing great and shouldn't have to fund her stepsister, but she also made the choice based on her success to pay for all her own things, you should continue to buy the things you would normally buy for stepdaughter, don't make her spend her entire small wage on clothes and stuff just because your daughter does.", "NTA\n\nAsk your wife for how long this should go on if you do this. Lets say in 5 yrs your SD gets a really good paying job after uni and your daughter becomes a sahm - would she expect her daughter to give half of her salary to her sister for the rest of their lifes (spoiler: no, oc not, bc this will somehow be \"totally different\").", "NTA. Stand your ground.  Your daughter\u2019s money is her own business. Not to share.", "NTA. Your daughter is using her atheltic talent to make her OWN money. Your wife is ridiculous for her suggestion. As for your stepdaughter, she needs to get over it or find other ways to make more money.", "NTA\n\nYour wife wants to STEAL the money your daughter has earned and give it to your stepdaughter.\n\nThat may sound like a harsh way of describing it, but that\u2019s what it boils down to - coercing her to give her earned money to her stepsister.\n\nIf your wife can\u2019t comprehend that, it\u2019s a huge red flag.", "Your wife is seriously out of line. She needs to take a step back.", "NTA\n\nYour wife wants to turn your daughters' earnings into some sort of robin hood tale for her daughter.  \n\nYour stepdaughter is not lazy as I've seen in comments.  She is working and going to school, she makes more than most teenagers.  I understand why she would be a bit jealous, but it is not your responsibility to make everything even.  Nothing in life is even.  Different jobs pay different, it's just a fact of life.  It is your responsibility to make sure what you personally provide for the girls is even. \n\nOP your daughter is young.  Teach her how to save and invest, that is A LOT of money for a teen to make.  She can use her smart decisions and wisdom to set her up for a great jump start to her adult life.  Encourage her to not spend all her money, saving is a life skill everyone needs.  Teach your stepdaughter the same skills, save, invest, she will be good in the future too. \n\nGood luck OP, if you want, consider letting your wife read the comments here, it may help her see a different perspective.", "NTA. My sister babysat for years and made absolute bank. Occasionally she'd buy me coffee or an extra side of fries while she was out, and I was very appreciative of that, especially since she did it without me asking and just to be nice. That being said, my parents wouldn't dream of making her give ME some of HER money. \n\nYour daughter earned that money. It's hers, and she can do whatever the hell she wants with it. Your wife is jealous and delusional.", "NTA- it's NOT your daughter job to provide for her step sister and your wife needs to get a grip.", "NTA\n\nWhat your wife is suggesting is straight up theft. She wants to force your daughter to pay for things for her daughter, against her will. How far is she going to take this? Is she going to just take money from her bank account, because she's the adult?\n\nSit your wife down again and tell her very firmly that you will not tolerate any more discussion about your daughters finances. If your wife approaches your daughter to pressure her or actively steals from her, that you will go to the police.\n\nYou're right that this is just life. Life's unfair. Your daughter has invested in her skillset, and is reaping the rewards. Your stepdaughter didn't. She needs to stop whining and realise that if she wants to earn more, she has to invest in her own skillset. Not steal from other people's hard work. And if your wife doesn't apologise profusely for her greediness, you have a much bigger problem in your marriage.", "NTA\nYour stepdaughter is doing her best and maybe you can chip something in for her to get better stuff - but your daughters money is HERS and gets alone.", "NTA. *You* aren\u2019t giving one daughter more than another. Your *daughter* is getting herself out there, utilising a skill set she\u2019s been developing for a while and reaping the inevitable benefits of her consistent work. \n\nYou should be proud of her, and protect her independence at all costs. \n\nIn life, there is no \u201cfair\u201d. Your daughter doesn\u2019t have to share her hard-earned money just because someone else is jealous of her success. What\u2019s next ? Your daughter gets a boyfriend and has to share that, too ? She gets engaged, and stepdaughter expects a bit of that, too ? \n\nStepdaughter needs to see a therapist yesterday. It\u2019s understandable to feel \u201cless than\u201d around a successful person, especially of the same age and within a blended family, but those feelings need to be managed properly. Enabling that toxicity like your wife is suggesting would be detrimental to her growth and value as a person.", "NTA. But I\u2019m assuming there is a disparity in what you\u2019ve invested in each child, having paid for tennis lessons and equipment and clothing for one and nothing similar for the other. I would let the stepdaughter know that if she would like lessons in anything or some other investment in her education in the future, you\u2019ll pay for that and have a similar amount of money set aside for her. Maybe she would like digital art classes or something like that. This is an opportunity to lift up both children so they both have good opportunities in the future.", "NTA\nShut this down immediately! Your wife and SD are out of order. \n\nYour daughter should not be forced to share her income with her stepsister to make things \u201cfair\u201d. \n\nYour SD and wife need to accept that life is not fair. Does she get money from her siblings or parents to make their incomes \u201cfair\u201d?", "NTA - but I hope you are teaching your daughter to manage her money wisely (and that this isn't an under the table job).  Many families teach kids to divide their earnings into three buckets - spend, save and give.  The spend piece can go to her electronics and clothing.  Save for longer term items, you might want to encourage medium term (a car, a trip) as well as longer term items - a college savings or building up to a house.  And give is for the community.  She might choose to spread her earning among a wide variety of organizations or make a bigger impact by making larger donations to a select few.  Encourage her to think about causes that are meaningful to her (tennis scholarships for disadvantaged youth, teen programs, political causes, environmental, social programs etc.).  Help her research the organizations to make sure her donations will be going to the cause and not to pay massive admin/fund raising costs and that the organization is transparent, has a good track record etc.", "If one daughter becomes a doctor and the other drops out of school, will your wife be covering the difference in salaries so they can have the same size house? \n\nI can barely imagine a worse idea than your wife's in this situation.  One daughter learns that effort doesn't doesn't effect outcomes and the other learns that you think other people are entitled to the money she works hard to earn. \n\nIf your wife wants things to be \"fair,\" she needs to cultivate some ambition in her kid not punish your kid for success.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is delusional.", "INFO: You said her daughter is being vocal about it. What does that mean? Is she simply frustrated and venting? Is she actively lobbying for her sister's money? It sounds like she's working and capable, but frustrated to me, which is totally understandable. She's working the same hours and bringing home less than a fifth of her stepsister. I'd be frustrated too! \n\nYou spent a lot of time telling us what your daughter is good at, and no time telling us what your stepdaughter is good at. How could you help her find a way to earn more?\n\nI don't think the answer is your daughter sharing her money, but some compassion about this is fair.", "INFO: Does your stepdaughter have any skills she could tutor?  Math, computer coding, music, art\u2026 there are parents that will happily pay teens to tutor their children in those subjects.\n\nClearly your daughter has the personality type to put herself out there and get clients for herself, but your stepdaughter is more introverted.\n\nInstead of fighting over how your daughter should pay your stepdaughter for\u2026whatever your wife is thinking, how about you all sit down as a family and figure something out?\n\nStart by asking your stepdaughter what SHE wants to do.  Tell her that whining and complaining about her stepsister having tennis tutoring money was not acceptable, but that maybe you can all brainstorm some ways for your stepdaughter to earn more than fast food money.\n\nAsk your wife for her insight as to what her daughter\u2019s strengths are.  Maybe your stepdaughter is struggling with low self esteem and doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s good enough at anything to really tutor in something.  Hearing her mom hype her up might be inspiring.\n\nAsk your daughter her methods of getting clients.  Ask her if anyone has ever asked about some other type of tutoring, or babysitting, or something similar but that your daughter doesn\u2019t have time to do.  \n\nShare your own insights/advice.  \n\nIntroverts can make money in lots of ways that don\u2019t involve a lot of social interaction.  Photographers can sell photos to stock photo sites. If she\u2019s an artist, she could make and monetize instructional videos and TikToks. If she likes to read, she could start a review/critique blog of current literature and submit articles to online publications.  If she likes anime or webtoons, she could start learning the Adobe Creative Cloud suite of programs: it\u2019s the industry standard in graphic design and animation. \n\nGo around the table, each of you thinking of ways to help your stepdaughter find something she\u2019s excited about trying.  It might not work out, but it shows that you have all \u201cseen\u201d her and want to help her succeed.  \n\nIf she still chooses to not try anything and bemoan her lot in life, then she will have to figure it out herself, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what will happen.", "No one is paying a HS junior 75 bucks an hour for tennis lessons", "NTA.

She could make more but I limit her hours so that she can concentrate on school.\n\nMy stepdaughter is reserved and not very athletic. We always tried to sign her up to the same sport and team with my daughter but she either objected or quit a couple of weeks in. I get it, sports is not for everyone so I never made her feel bad about it. She recently turned 16 and got a job at a burger place nearby.
