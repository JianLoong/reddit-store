Despite being only a year apart in age, our daughters were completely different and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n\nMy daughter has always been athletic and outgoing. Growing up, she played basketball, softball, soccer, volleyball, and even golf. In middle school, she picked up tennis and never looked back. I paid for her to have private lessons and when she found out how much I was paying for those lessons, she decided that\u2019s what she wants to do as her teenage job. She\u2019s now a junior, is one of the best players on her HS team, and teaching tennis lessons. She teaches elementary school kids and charges $75 per hour per kid. With her skills and outgoing personality, she has a waiting list of kids and makes about $1,200 a week. She could make more but I limit her hours so that she can concentrate on school.\n\nMy stepdaughter is reserved and not very athletic. We always tried to sign her up to the same sport and team with my daughter but she either objected or quit a couple of weeks in. I get it, sports is not for everyone so I never made her feel bad about it. She recently turned 16 and got a job at a burger place nearby. She\u2019s making $13 an hour and brings home less than $200 a week. \n\nMy daughter recently decided that she wants to be independent by buying her clothes and electronics with her own money. Obviously she can afford the latest styles and gadgets. She recently brought herself the top of the line Mac. My stepdaughter is jealous of her sister and have been very vocal about it. \n\nWhile we were bed last night, my wife said it was unfair one is making so much more than the other. I answered that there\u2019s nothing we can do about it and it\u2019s a good life lesson for the girls. My wife then suggested we have my daughter use her money to help my stepdaughter buy the same things or we cover the pay difference between the girls. I laughed because I thought she was joking but she wasn\u2019t. We whisper argued for about an hour before we went to sleep. This morning she brought it up again and accused said I\u2019m refusing because I\u2019m playing favorites and that\u2019s an AH move for a parent. We argued until we had to leave for work.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for reading my post and giving me your input. I\u2019ve read through most of the replies during my lunch and I\u2019ll get through the rest after work. I\u2019ll answer some common questions.\n\nWe tried to sign my stepdaughter up for the same sports as my daughter because we thought it would be a bonding experience. We also wanted to get her out of the house and meet people because she spends most of her time in her room playing world of warcraft. We didn\u2019t make her participate but asked that she try things for at least a couple of weeks then she could quit if she wanted to. We tried to get her to sign up for things that she enjoys but she always refuses. Before getting this job, she spent much of her free time playing games so I\u2019m at a lost to think of any marketable skills she could leverage into tutoring.", "created_utc": 1696338792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yrll9/aita_for_refusing_to_making_sure_things_are_equal/", "score": 5799, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter has skills that are in demand and her salary reflects that.  Your stepdaughter is starting out on a typical student career path and her salary reflects that.  Forcing your daughter to fund your stepdaughter would be the height of unfairness.  Your wife needs to stop trying to turn your home into a crabpot and let her daughter figure out where her own talents lie.  \n\n\nMy BIL has a doctorate, with a well-paying job in his field, his wife is in high fashion, and they live a DINK life.  They are buying real estate in New York.  My husband and I are civil servants with children to raise.  According to your wife's ideas, my BIL should be sending me palimony checks every month to support my children, after all he's my husband's brother!  That's not life, and she would do a disservice to her daughter with her bad ideas.", "NTA\n\nStep daughter shouldn\u2019t benefit from her step-sisters hard work \u2018just because\u2019. \n\nYour wife is silly to even suggest that your daughter should have to pay for anything regarding her step sister. Outrageous to even think it, let alone say it out loud. \n\nYou\u2019re not playing favourites. If your wife gets her way all she will do is breed resentment from your daughter to her step sister.", "NTA - why would you punish one child to benefit the other?  It is a good lesson for both girls.  The one who makes less is learning she needs to learn valuable skills to pay for what she wants.  The one who makes more is reaping the benefits of consistent effort.  \n\n\nI do think you should look into getting your step daughter lessons in things that interest her, not just what her step-sister is doing.  Help her try some things out.  Maybe buy her a few things so she doesn't feel quite so left behind, but not as nice as what your other daughter is able to buy for herself.", "NTA - \n\nThis one is VERY cut and dry for me. Very. \n\nYour wife is asking you to both punish your daughter for her success, and to also reward her daughter for her (comparative) \u201ccomplacency\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s surprising your wife wouldn\u2019t be able to see how unfair that actually is. \n\nThere is no logical reason to force your daughter to share her (incredibly impressive) income with her stepsister imo. \n\nNow, your daughter has reaped the benefits of private tennis lessons but it sounds like that was the biggest \u201cleg up\u201d she was given. \n\nI can see you and your wife paying to give her daughter a similar leg up if she showed the interest, but ultimately both of these young women are sleeping in beds they\u2019ve made. \n\nYour wife is being entitled, and unreasonable. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with daughter\u2019s existing income. \n\nTreating her daughter the way she is suggesting now will do nothing but enforce and reward her crappy and jealous behavior. \n\nEdit: my phrasing was much too harsh in condemning OP\u2019s step daughter of complacency which wasn\u2019t fair. \n\nMade small language adjustments.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner wants to take money away from your daughter (Money that is hers, that she earned), and give it to her daughter, that's favoritism, it's not your daughter fault that her step-sibling makes less than her, and the step-sibling should learn to not aspire to spend more than what she can afford, your partner is setting up her daughter for failure as an adult.", "NTA but you will be if you go along with this by forcing your daughter to give her money to your stepdaughter or paying for your stepdaughter to buy the same stuff as your daughter. Honestly, your wife gets major side-eye just for the suggestion and from now on you need to be watching her behavior closely.", "Your wife and stepdaughter are not entitled to anyone\u2019s money except their own.

Crafts (think etsy), a new language, writing...anything. Obv paying with your/your wife's money, not your daughters!! The two girls haven't had the same opportunities growing up so I do think putting some effort into levelling the playing field is a good idea.", "NTA. I used to make money riding and training horses when I was a kid. I was told my \u201chobby\u201d was expensive so I had to buy my own gear. Fair enough! \n\nWhat was *unfair* was that my older brother had an expensive hobby but he couldn\u2019t monetize it through either talent or ability so my parents supported his hobby financially, fully funding it. \n\nI resented the fuck out of that. Why did they pay for him but not me? \n\nIf they had taken **my earnings** to subsidize his hobby or purchases I would have been so pissed. \n\nIt\u2019s not equality to make one sister pay for the other. It\u2019s not equitable, either. \n\nStep-daughter can get a better job or she can quit complaining. Life isn\u2019t fair and you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a good lesson to learn now.", "NTA. Your wife's daughter is not entitled to your child's money. Your wife can supplement her child, but she cannot steal from your daughter.  I can't imagine my parents saying that I was entitled to one of my sibling's incomes because I was jealous.", "Info: can you help her maybe get a better job? Is she good at her studies or anything else? Tutoring elementary kids can make her 50$ or plus an hour if she is good. \nI am never been sporty but I make the bank tutoring while in school.\nAlso as your daughter tennis lesson where so expensive (I know I have a kid doing it and 100$ is the minimum for a tennis teacher) did step daughter had the privilege or receiving equal financial help in cultivating whatever her hobby, passion is? It\u2019s not your daughter job to help her sister out, but it is parental duty to offer all kids equal opportunities and then let them put to fruition.", "NTA. Where is it playing favourits if your daughter is allowed to keep HER money, she owns with her job, while your step daughter doesn't. Sorry, but live is not fair and taking away the money of your daughter would only lead to her hating her stepsister, reducing her hours so she doesn't have to work to pay her sister and hiding her money. She has talent, she should be allowed to profit of it.\n\nYou might offer to pay for curses for your step daughter so she will be able to get a good job or teenage job as well - not sport but what she wants to do. But best teach her, to accept that others can earn more money and can use this money how they want. And to not be jelous. It is kind of childish to cry because sister is making more money and can afford more things.", "NTA\n\nMy sister is a lawyer making bank while I just started my career in IT recently. Like you daughter, my sister's much higher salary and pay in general is due to the work she put in on her own. She is now reaping the benefits and I am definitely not entitled to the same lifestyle she has just because we are siblings.", "NTA - in the future if your daughter only earns 50k a year and your step daughter 150k is your wife going to expect her child to give her step sister 50k to make it even or for her (your wife) to make it even? Nope because that\u2019s just plain stupid.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter has earn her own money so she can buy what she chooses. If your stepdaughter can't because she earns less, it's ok too. If she wants something, she should ask her mother to buy it, not her sister. And your wife should be understanding that her step-daughter can spends her money buying things for her, not for your stepchild.\n\nMaybe your step daughter is jeaulous of your daughter, like she has a good personality, she's good in sports... while your step daughter is not. You could try to speak to her about her feelings.", "Info: did you offer your stepdaughter the same opportunity to have private lessons in things she was actually interested in, or just sports?\n\nTreating them equally means equal opportunity, not equal outcome. You say you signed SD up for the same sports teams but that obviously isn't where her interest lies, meanwhile if she had an interest in art or music or tech and you made the same investment toward private lessons/equipment, she could have theoretically pursued those interests to the same results as your daughter has.\n\nYour wife is going about this wrong. But I feel saying n-t-a to this post also implies the daughter is entitled and hasn't worked hard in her own way which I can't agree with based on the info given. Your daughter is doing great and shouldn't have to fund her stepsister, but she also made the choice based on her success to pay for all her own things, you should continue to buy the things you would normally buy for stepdaughter, don't make her spend her entire small wage on clothes and stuff just because your daughter does.", "NTA\n\nAsk your wife for how long this should go on if you do this. Lets say in 5 yrs your SD gets a really good paying job after uni and your daughter becomes a sahm - would she expect her daughter to give half of her salary to her sister for the rest of their lifes (spoiler: no, oc not, bc this will somehow be \"totally different\").", "NTA. Stand your ground.  Your daughter\u2019s money is her own business. Not to share.", "NTA. Your daughter is using her atheltic talent to make her OWN money. Your wife is ridiculous for her suggestion. As for your stepdaughter, she needs to get over it or find other ways to make more money.", "NTA\n\nYour wife wants to STEAL the money your daughter has earned and give it to your stepdaughter.\n\nThat may sound like a harsh way of describing it, but that\u2019s what it boils down to - coercing her to give her earned money to her stepsister.\n\nIf your wife can\u2019t comprehend that, it\u2019s a huge red flag.", "Your wife is seriously out of line. She needs to take a step back.", "NTA\n\nYour wife wants to turn your daughters' earnings into some sort of robin hood tale for her daughter.  \n\nYour stepdaughter is not lazy as I've seen in comments.  She is working and going to school, she makes more than most teenagers.  I understand why she would be a bit jealous, but it is not your responsibility to make everything even.  Nothing in life is even.  Different jobs pay different, it's just a fact of life.  It is your responsibility to make sure what you personally provide for the girls is even. \n\nOP your daughter is young.  Teach her how to save and invest, that is A LOT of money for a teen to make.  She can use her smart decisions and wisdom to set her up for a great jump start to her adult life.  Encourage her to not spend all her money, saving is a life skill everyone needs.  Teach your stepdaughter the same skills, save, invest, she will be good in the future too. \n\nGood luck OP, if you want, consider letting your wife read the comments here, it may help her see a different perspective.", "NTA. My sister babysat for years and made absolute bank. Occasionally she'd buy me coffee or an extra side of fries while she was out, and I was very appreciative of that, especially since she did it without me asking and just to be nice. That being said, my parents wouldn't dream of making her give ME some of HER money. \n\nYour daughter earned that money. It's hers, and she can do whatever the hell she wants with it. Your wife is jealous and delusional.", "NTA- it's NOT your daughter job to provide for her step sister and your wife needs to get a grip.", "NTA\n\nWhat your wife is suggesting is straight up theft. She wants to force your daughter to pay for things for her daughter, against her will. How far is she going to take this? Is she going to just take money from her bank account, because she's the adult?\n\nSit your wife down again and tell her very firmly that you will not tolerate any more discussion about your daughters finances. If your wife approaches your daughter to pressure her or actively steals from her, that you will go to the police.\n\nYou're right that this is just life. Life's unfair. Your daughter has invested in her skillset, and is reaping the rewards. Your stepdaughter didn't. She needs to stop whining and realise that if she wants to earn more, she has to invest in her own skillset. Not steal from other people's hard work. And if your wife doesn't apologise profusely for her greediness, you have a much bigger problem in your marriage.", "NTA\nYour stepdaughter is doing her best and maybe you can chip something in for her to get better stuff - but your daughters money is HERS and gets alone.", "NTA. *You* aren\u2019t giving one daughter more than another. Your *daughter* is getting herself out there, utilising a skill set she\u2019s been developing for a while and reaping the inevitable benefits of her consistent work. \n\nYou should be proud of her, and protect her independence at all costs. \n\nIn life, there is no \u201cfair\u201d. Your daughter doesn\u2019t have to share her hard-earned money just because someone else is jealous of her success. What\u2019s next ? Your daughter gets a boyfriend and has to share that, too ? She gets engaged, and stepdaughter expects a bit of that, too ? \n\nStepdaughter needs to see a therapist yesterday. It\u2019s understandable to feel \u201cless than\u201d around a successful person, especially of the same age and within a blended family, but those feelings need to be managed properly. Enabling that toxicity like your wife is suggesting would be detrimental to her growth and value as a person.", "NTA. But I\u2019m assuming there is a disparity in what you\u2019ve invested in each child, having paid for tennis lessons and equipment and clothing for one and nothing similar for the other. I would let the stepdaughter know that if she would like lessons in anything or some other investment in her education in the future, you\u2019ll pay for that and have a similar amount of money set aside for her. Maybe she would like digital art classes or something like that. This is an opportunity to lift up both children so they both have good opportunities in the future.", "NTA\nShut this down immediately! Your wife and SD are out of order. \n\nYour daughter should not be forced to share her income with her stepsister to make things \u201cfair\u201d. \n\nYour SD and wife need to accept that life is not fair. Does she get money from her siblings or parents to make their incomes \u201cfair\u201d?", "NTA - but I hope you are teaching your daughter to manage her money wisely (and that this isn't an under the table job).  Many families teach kids to divide their earnings into three buckets - spend, save and give.  The spend piece can go to her electronics and clothing.  Save for longer term items, you might want to encourage medium term (a car, a trip) as well as longer term items - a college savings or building up to a house.  And give is for the community.  She might choose to spread her earning among a wide variety of organizations or make a bigger impact by making larger donations to a select few.  Encourage her to think about causes that are meaningful to her (tennis scholarships for disadvantaged youth, teen programs, political causes, environmental, social programs etc.).

One daughter learns that effort doesn't doesn't effect outcomes and the other learns that you think other people are entitled to the money she works hard to earn. \n\nIf your wife wants things to be \"fair,\" she needs to cultivate some ambition in her kid not punish your kid for success.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is delusional.", "INFO: You said her daughter is being vocal about it. What does that mean? Is she simply frustrated and venting? Is she actively lobbying for her sister's money? It sounds like she's working and capable, but frustrated to me, which is totally understandable. She's working the same hours and bringing home less than a fifth of her stepsister. I'd be frustrated too! \n\nYou spent a lot of time telling us what your daughter is good at, and no time telling us what your stepdaughter is good at. How could you help her find a way to earn more?\n\nI don't think the answer is your daughter sharing her money, but some compassion about this is fair.", "INFO: Does your stepdaughter have any skills she could tutor?  Math, computer coding, music, art\u2026 there are parents that will happily pay teens to tutor their children in those subjects.\n\nClearly your daughter has the personality type to put herself out there and get clients for herself, but your stepdaughter is more introverted.\n\nInstead of fighting over how your daughter should pay your stepdaughter for\u2026whatever your wife is thinking, how about you all sit down as a family and figure something out?\n\nStart by asking your stepdaughter what SHE wants to do.  Tell her that whining and complaining about her stepsister having tennis tutoring money was not acceptable, but that maybe you can all brainstorm some ways for your stepdaughter to earn more than fast food money.\n\nAsk your wife for her insight as to what her daughter\u2019s strengths are.  Maybe your stepdaughter is struggling with low self esteem and doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s good enough at anything to really tutor in something.  Hearing her mom hype her up might be inspiring.\n\nAsk your daughter her methods of getting clients.  Ask her if anyone has ever asked about some other type of tutoring, or babysitting, or something similar but that your daughter doesn\u2019t have time to do.  \n\nShare your own insights/advice.  \n\nIntroverts can make money in lots of ways that don\u2019t involve a lot of social interaction.  Photographers can sell photos to stock photo sites. If she\u2019s an artist, she could make and monetize instructional videos and TikToks. If she likes to read, she could start a review/critique blog of current literature and submit articles to online publications.  If she likes anime or webtoons, she could start learning the Adobe Creative Cloud suite of programs: it\u2019s the industry standard in graphic design and animation. \n\nGo around the table, each of you thinking of ways to help your stepdaughter find something she\u2019s excited about trying.  It might not work out, but it shows that you have all \u201cseen\u201d her and want to help her succeed.  \n\nIf she still chooses to not try anything and bemoan her lot in life, then she will have to figure it out herself, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what will happen.", "No one is paying a HS junior 75 bucks an hour for tennis lessons", "NTA.

She could make more but I limit her hours so that she can concentrate on school.\n\nMy stepdaughter is reserved and not very athletic. We always tried to sign her up to the same sport and team with my daughter but she either objected or quit a couple of weeks in. I get it, sports is not for everyone so I never made her feel bad about it. She recently turned 16 and got a job at a burger place nearby. She\u2019s making $13 an hour and brings home less than $200 a week. \n\nMy daughter recently decided that she wants to be independent by buying her clothes and electronics with her own money.

It may not be skilled labor, but you work the entire shift for relatively little pay.\n\nPersonally, the issue I see is OP took a non-athletic kid and put her into the same sports, teams and training programs as his very outgoing, gifted, athletic kid. 'Here, everyone is equal. You can be constantly outperformed by your stepsibling!'\n\nOf course she didn't get the same benefit. Equal here was not equitable. Saying you treated both kids fairly but putting one into something they don't like isn't really fair.\n\nSolution here is to tell the stepdaughter to find something she wants to do and set a reward for finishing it. The lesson isn't 'tough luck she worked hard' but 'find something you're good at and like and build skills and you can also do well.'", "That\u2019s a good point, it\u2019s not like SD is doing terribly or anything. She\u2019s in a very typical spot. I actually made way less than that when I was her age. Her sister is just making wildly different money and is far, far above average for a teenager. There\u2019s also a big element of luck to it that she lives in a community where so many kids/their parents are willing to pay for private tennis lessons. SD could be really talented in, idk, banjo playing, but there may not be as wide of a market for that in the community.", "I would suggest that Mom here is doing her daughter no favors. SHe is doing just fine for a girl her age. Mom seems jealous and is breeding resentment. Parents should stop comparing the two girls.", "They both were presented with the same options. Stepdaughter wasn't interested. What you say is true in life between two persons with different opportunities offered to them. But here, OP says: \"We always tried to sign her up to the same sport and team with my daughter but she either objected or quit a couple of weeks in.\"  \nThe interest wasn't there, and it's ok, but that means she doesn't have the qualifications to earn the money her step-sister has.  \n\n\nBut you make a good point by saying the parents should be showing stepdaughter alternatives way to make money.\n\nAlso, if the parents never presented alternatives to stepdaughter and never showed her other possible hubbies than sports, then it means they were not treated the same in terms of privilege and I'd agree with you.", "Yeah. that kid is making more than me at 37. It's a pretty ridiculous income for someone so young, but if people are willing to pay for her expertise, more power to her!", "How many 30 year-olds are making $1,200 a week?", "OP's wife is the nasty and jealous one.", "Agree. Also, different people have different income potentials and talents. I know a family where one daughter went to Harvard Law School and is making a killing, while the other is a low earning, very talented artist.", "Yeah, everyone\u2019s in here talking fairness, when this would be straight up theft!", "Signing her up for the same sport and team was a recipe for disaster.  It's a direct competition at that point, in a field where the step-daughter already would be starting with a handicap.  The best outcome in a situation like that is loss of self esteem.\n\nAsk her what her interests are and try to support or forward those if they are marketable.  If not, find a skill she is good at and market that.  If she doesn't have that, it's time to look for an adjacent skill to a skill she is good at and start building.", "They need to encourage separation and success on her own terms or she'll spend her teenage years feeling less than. Hard thing, for an already shy young girl.\n\nSome lessons or classes or help on something entirely separate are needed. OP tried to invest in things to make her just like her very gifted stepsister, where she watched someone else in her household just... be better than her. Ouch.\n\nHelp her find her success elsewhere. A better job. Advertise babysitting, tutoring. Get her a CPR certification. Lifeguarding. Help her advertise on local groups. Help her babysit/ tutor for some people you know and get references going. There's ways to encourage her without feeling like a comparison.\n\nBe even better to set up a class/ goal and set a reward for something she does want.", "Well, the hours are extremely limited, too. And during nights/ weekends, when the kids are available. Most adults don't want to work just nights and weekends.\n\nBut yes, you can pick up extra cash tutoring. 20-40 is probably more reasonable for most people. Higher end is usually either special needs (ADHD, Autism, learning disability) or STEM-specific for high school/ middle school where parents haven't done that in decades and can't help as much.\n\nIt also often disappears during breaks. It's probably better as a supplement to earn extra cash for a savings account, car down payment, vacation fund than a reliable full-time job for an adult with regular bills.", "Might not be 16 students a week but your math checks out at 16 *hours* a week, over 2 hours a day. That\u2019s a lot. I guess it could in theory be two 8 hour days but that\u2019s a lot of physical exercise.", "Agreed.  People need to remember who makes up a large portion of tennis clientele.  A lot of well off country club people with significant enough disposable income that $75/hr for tennis lessons is a drop in the bucket.", "Yeah I know.", "yeah, doesn't sound accurate. was wondering why nobody else questioned it.", "why is it up to OP to come up with ideas for SD? Her own mother knows her well and should know what her talents are. Or the bio dad if in the picture.", "What about tech? Is she interested in coding? Game design? Godot is free to use if she wants to try her hand at that. If nothing else, this should teach them both about the value of marketable skills and what happens if you don't have any.", "House and pet sitting as well!", "Yes yes yes to babysitting and tutoring! I lifeguarded summers in high school but never had an after school job during the year, and I was NEVER without money. I babysat and tutored a few times a week and sometimes taught Saturday morning swim lessons (I was established with the program and was able to sort of come* and go for 6-week sessions, though I realize someone breaking in might not have the same flexibility). It wasn\u2019t $1200 a week money, but it wasn\u2019t peanuts either, and I was consistently able to buy/do the things I wanted to.\n\n*fixed a typo", "The daughter is already earning as much as she can. If she went into business with her stepsister, she would be losing money since she would have to give part of it to her stepsister. OP said that he was limiting her hours so she can concentrate on school.", "I'm concerned she has reached this age and her own mother does not know what she likes to do.", "Yeah, it's a good time for a lesson that hard work builds success. Her success doesn't have to be monetary at work.\n\nI wouldn't give the SD a laptop because her stepsister bought one with her own money. Wouldn't make the daughter pay her stepsister. Wouldn't give her extra money each month, just because.\n\nHowever, thousands were invested into those lessons that allowed the kid to do well and train others.\n\nMaybe give the SD some classes she can pick out that are skill building and use a laptop or new thing she wants as a reward for finishing that thing, whatever it is.\n\nI'm in California. We offer dual enrollment for high schools that allow high school kids to do community college classes that transfer into UC/ CSU. She can maybe do some core undergrad speech/ communications classes or humanities, etc. Ones pretty much required everywhere. Maybe she wants to do computer coding or an IT certificate? CPR as a certification for babysitting gigs? Lifeguard training? Find something she wants, reward doing it.\n\nIt can be a teaching moment. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Focus on you, build skills, work hard and do well on your own. \n\nDoesn't have to be a \"tough shit\" lesson, but can be a way to help her not build resentment and make things more equitable.", "Where is OP's wife's agency in this except to complain about OP's daughter's success? She knows her daughter better than anyone, except perhaps the bio father. Why aren't they responsible for helping their biological child? They know where her talents may lie.", "Yes, if the SD is good enough, she can also join gaming league that make more serious money. But if I am her age and make $16/hr, I will not be complaining.\n\nOP\u2019s wife sounds like a commie.", "it wouldnt be out of line for the parents to chip in and match savings on something like that to help motivate her too.", ">in large part because OP shelled out for private lessons. If they haven\u2019t done something similar for SD\n\nI mean it sounds like OP tried and even offered to let her pick something. Hell her WoW hobby could be monetized if she had the drive for it. Probably not going to be a huge streamer overnight but making more than $200 a week isn't a terribly high mark once she gets going.", "That would also take up her entire weekend if it's two 8-hour blocks, or have her doing every day potentially. Sounds like a very big time commitment for a \"limited\" situation. If she's actually making that much money I get it, maybe I'm just nitpicking the wording.", "Exactly!!  The country club is where I started to play and I played tournaments there. Those people have alot of money and they don't mind spending it on those things!", "Yeah - that doesn't strike me as THAT unreasonable.", "Agreed. I wonder if they ever tried to enroll her into something she would enjoy.", "Depends on how old they were. My son is definitely not super athletic, but we've signed him up for soccer and track the last few years (and continue to with his consent), as we want him to learn about playing on a team, and to get outside and do some exercise. That started at age 6/7, and it was a supremely non competitive environment, and we don't make it that way either. We've also signed him up for coding classes as he loves all things video games.\n\nI think it can be ok to nudge young kids into activities to just try something new. You don't know if you'll really fate it unless you try it. That said, I asked if he wanted to try flag football and he gave me the 7 year old equivalent of a hell no. Too much contact, no thank you. Totally fine, I get it, we'll stick to soccer and track. If OP was just trying to broaden stepdaughter's experiences, that's fine. If she wasn't young, or expressed that she didn't want to play sports, that's another thing entirely.", "Most teenagers don\u2019t even work the number of hours OPs stepdaughter is. She\u2019s just turned 16 and it looks like she\u2019s working 2 full shifts at the weekend (2 x 7.5h shift earns just under $200) along with school- it\u2019s quite a bit. She hasn\u2019t even said that it\u2019s unfair or unequal, just that she\u2019s jealous of her sister- and jeez, I\u2019d be too if I had to work a soul deadening job in order to make 1/6 of what my sister makes for the same time.", "She will probably get a full ride scholarship to college if she's as good as it sounds.", "> The athlete probably won\u2019t become professional and will have to find something to fall back on for money, whereas the non-athlete might pick a lucrative major and significantly out-earn her sister in the future.\n\nI agree but they should still push a bit the step daughter to find something and try it, she might not monetize it now, but I've seen countless friends that went to get degrees and after that they instead did drawings or litography and made names for themselves as artists, made me regret not learning anything sooner.", "I get that. \n\nThe point was more that the stepsister needs to get a skill herself and use it to make money.", "why didn't her mother chip in with suggestions? Why is it up to OP to figure this out when the mother has known her all her life, as well as her bio dad?", "Considering the daughter got golf lessons, and golf is pretty much the typical \"rich white mans sport\"...   \n\n\nYeah, OP is from a well off background.", "How is he treating her as a sub-standard replica? He said they were very different. And to be that good a player to command rates like that is not a common or easy thing. It takes practice, practice, practice, as well as natural talent.", "Maybe it was just the local rec leagues? \n\nI've signed all my kids up for a couple seasons of a bunch of sports. If I'd let my couch potato refuse to participate he wouldn't have discovered his LOVE of competitive swimming or his natural talent for martial arts.", "Yeah, I agree that step-daughter should find a passion. Just saying that it\u2019s normal not to have a monetized passion at that age. She still has plenty of time to figure out what she wants to do in life, and this income disparity is temporary and not reflective of their situations in adulthood.", "All of this. I don\u2019t get why people are saying the non-sporty sister needs to find their way to hustle money and find a way to make that kind of money. The kind of money the athlete is making is abnormal for a teenager and no one should be held up to that standard", "Yup. It takes just one kid to roll their ankle for the headaches to start. Especially if they\u2019re in the US", "You're right, but a couple is 2. Maybe 4 if you stretch it. Certainly not 10.", "To nitpick, OP said \"Top of the line Mac\". Macbook air is not top of the line.", "She doesn\u2019t merely want to punish her; she basically wants to commit financial abuse against her stepdaughter.", "That\u2019s my read on it. Without anything else to go on, OP was trying to ease SD into something\u2026 and with the other daughter there - she could assist and it could even be a bonding experience.", "also,  its really hard to be parents of kids in different teams.  double the practice, double the games,  you cant be 2 places at once.  i used to put my boys on the same teams, till one or the other lost interest.", "Maybe that was their intent, but as someone who was a very non-athletic kid, about the only thing that would make getting signed up involuntarily for not just one but apparently multiple sports teams, would be constantly getting signed up with a step sibling who was always going to be better at it than me. I get \u201cwhy can\u2019t you be more like my daughter\u201d vibes from that. Of course having daughter subsidize SD is just dumb, but I do wonder how much effort OP and his wife have put into guiding SD in ways that actually work for SD, instead of just expecting her to be more like daughter.", "This can easily back fire though.\nBeing on a team with a sibling means that you might be competing against them for attention. \nAlso if the daughters been doing the sport for years...theres going to be huge gaps in skill. There would be comparisons between the two girls constantly. \nIt could easily go badly, and create toxic enviroment rather than a supportive one.", "Why does the SD has to earn money? Typically Most 16 year old usually get the first job in fast food. What OP\u2019s daughter is unique and atypical for a 15 year old. She should spend her money how she sees fit. SD needs to swallow her envy.", "Stepmom would still expect her to share her money. I don't know why SM doesn't just pay her daughter $1000 a week if she thinks that's fair. Why does she think OP and his daughter should pay.", "How so? Legitimately, how so? Yes, the sister could do it if she specialized in robotics soldering for one on one tutoring, or ballet, or Spanish language (not entirely level), or fashion design, or autoCad drawing, but she had to have already put in the hours to master that, and also be a forward personality that would seek and draw in pupils. Yes, she can also pull that kind of money, but will she put in the effort and make her gentile nature handle it? So she could do it in the future. What could she master that would draw that salary?", "No, it\u2019s not. I had two sons. One ,although he likes sports,didn\u2019t enjoy competing. The other, everything was a competition. I encouraged them both to at least try sports before they decided whether or not they liked it. The older one decided that,even though he enjoyed sports, he didn\u2019t want to do it and decided he wanted to try music. The younger one tried just about every sport that there was and he finally settled on football and track and field. It wasn\u2019t like we ignored one\u2019s talent over the others. It\u2019s possible that the sd has no idea what she really likes to do. Also, if she does, it doesn\u2019t mean that she will be making what her sister does. That\u2019s life. Just because the father knew what his daughter was good at and let her pursue it doesn\u2019t mean that he treated his sd as \u201c less than\u201d. Her mother should have been guiding her if she saw something that her daughter had a talent for or an interest in. How would HE know? It\u2019s not his kid.", "I didn't get that vibe at all. I put my daughter into 5 or 6 different sports and activities, maybe more, until she found the one she liked. Having the 2 girls on the same team is a matter of convenience. The step daughter wasn't forced to continue after she decided she didn't like it.", "I\u2019m sorry but where is her mother in all of this.  She\u2019s known SD way longer than OP. Shouldn\u2019t she be the one advocating for her daughter.", "One of the ways we let our kids find and develop their own interests is by having them try something and if they DON'T like it, cross that thing off the list and try something else. And it's normal to start with the things you're most familiar with. I like to knit. I showed each of my kids how to do it. None of them knits today. OK, I'm cool with that, but how would I have known without offering them the opportunity to TRY it? Am I a bad parent for introducing them to something that it turned out they didn't like? If he had FORCED stepdaughter to STAY in the sports, that wouldn't be cool. But it doesn't sound like SD has any ideas of her own, she hasn't said \"I don't want to play tennis, I want to learn how to sew instead.\" If she's not offering any ideas of her own, it's fine for parent/stepparent to help her with suggestions and let her figure things out by trial and error.", "It is a bad thing if she had to pursue sports but was not offered the chance to pursue something else that didn\u2019t involve athletics. The time she spent \u201ctrying \u201c sports may have been better spent trying something else. Not that OP is necessarily an AH here; sports probably worked for him and they obviously worked wonders for his tennis loving daughter. But there\u2019s a hell of a lot more inside that box than sports. Kids who aren\u2019t interested in anything have either not been exposed to the kinds of things that they might actually like or they\u2019ve been conditioned to believe that they\u2019ll never be good at anything so there\u2019s really no point in trying. OP and his wife need to put their heads together to figure out what SD might like, or perhaps even talk to SD and listen to what she says, observing not just her words but also her body language to identify the types of things that spark her.", "Who said \"couple\"? I said \"a few weeks\".", "Agreed. She wants to steal OP's daughter's money. OP should make sure his daughter has her funds in a safe place and his wife does not have access to her funds in any way. She seems like a gold digger and is influencing her daughter.", "And believe me she EARNED that money. Teaching anything is hard, much less a very physically demanding sport!", "It was not just the sport. OP is obviously very proud of his daughter, as he should be, but he put out a lot of detail about how great she is, how outgoing, how self sufficient. I said he compares the two a lot. It's not good to compare but to focus on each person's strenghts.", "Why only sports, though? Maybe she's just not an outgoing athletic person.  You don't have to join a team to know that.", "She sounds like she has different gifts and sports was never going to be her thing. If she\u2019s a gamer, maybe she\u2019d prefer a coding class.", "I mean the stepdaughter has an after-school job. I wouldn't call her *not* a go-getter simply because the other has a set of skills that's more lucrative. Not everyone even has the drive to work at that age while balancing school.", "Oh. I don\u2019t force myself near her. I last saw her 2 years ago at my dads birthday. Otherwise the next time I\u2019ll see her will likely be my grandmas funeral. Which my dad is fully paying for her care and she thinks that\u2019s not enough. She\u2019s painful to deal with. It\u2019s funny I have horrible anxiety, but she doesn\u2019t set it off at all. Probably because I just don\u2019t care and my medical job is much more stressful than her.", "Damn, that girl is earning more a week than I do as an adult with my full time job in a specialized field in healthcare. Not gonna lie, a little jealous, lol, but she also has a skill I don't have. She has spent years  of hard work practicing and honing that skill and has gotten good enough to be able to make money with it in high school. That's straight up impressive and good for her. Of course the step daughter is jealous, but that's kinda life.\n\nEdit to add: OP is NTA at all.", "And if stepdaughter has different gifts, it is she would must discover them.\n\nA go-getter would be trying out different hobbies, interests and passions.\n\nHopefully, stepdaughter discovers her passion and works it.", "This. What about encouraging her to build a business building websites or using technical skills? If she spends a lot of time on her computer perhaps that\u2019s a more viable option.", " The OP's daughter is the very definition of a go-getter.\n\nA Go-Getter is a person who works very hard and who wants very much to succeed.\n\nThe OP's daughter is, obviously, one who strives to get ahead and challenges herself more.\n\nThe stepdaughter may be a hard worker, reliable, responsible but does not go above and beyond her prescribed duties, she will not rise to the level she might.\n\nIf the stepdaughter is content with her choices, it should be all good.\n\nThe stepdaughter is on par with what is normal for a 16 year old.\n\nHowever, she is not trying to think outside the box.\n\nStepdaughter is not trying new activities or hobbies  in order to discover hidden talents.\n\nStepdaughter is doing nothing to increase her opportunities.\n\nThe stepdaughter is not a go-getter.\n\nThe daughter is a go-getter."]}
