{"id": 1405, "submission_id": "ymf9pk", "title": "AITA for booking a trip with my cousin versus my boyfriend?", "selftext": "The brief background is that I and my BF met through my cousin \u201cJoe\u201d, who is my BF\u2019s high school best friend. So yes my BF is my cousin\u2019s BF if you want to repeat the same joke that\u2019s been going around the family.\n\nMy BF \u201cBlake\u201d is and has certain ideas of what is worth his money. A new motorcycle, or a trip out to big sky or a big biking destination are okay, but he has no interest in anywhere else. I barely convinced him to go with me to the beach city my family has been going for generations by pointing out that he didn\u2019t have to wear his helmet on his bike in state. I went on several trips with him, out of my pocket and with my time and effort put into getting a good deal on the plane, car and hotel rooms for us all. But he won\u2019t go where he doesn\u2019t want to, so I figure you can only bring a horse to water and all that. \n\nThe crux of it is that I *love* Vegas. I went a few times when I was younger, another time at 18, and I wanted to appreciate it as an adult that can step on the casino carpet without getting told off by staff. My cousin Joe has expressed interest in going out to Vegas- he\u2019s never really had a chance for a vacation outside of our current region. Blake has previously, when there wasn\u2019t an active attempt to stay in Vegas, expressed a disinterest because he doesn\u2019t like casinos. \n\nSo Joe and I got together and worked on finding a good deal on our flight and hotel room (different beds but same room because why tf not save some cash). We\u2019ve finalized payments and taken the appropriate time off work. We even planned it in my birth month because it\u2019ll be much warmer there than it is here (both of us *hate* the cold)\n\nAt dinner tonight with Blake, I was thrilled to tell him about mine and Joe\u2019s plans. He asked to see details and I showed the hotel room pictures, the flight seat arrangements, the couple events we were planning to check out. He stopped reacting and I asked what was wrong and he said \u201cWhat could be wrong about my boyfriend running off with my best friend?\u201d\n\nThat set the tone for the rest of the discussion. I\u2019d say that Blake didn\u2019t seem interested but he\u2019d respond that we never asked *this* time if he wanted to join, knowing that we were planning to go for certain. Then he\u2019d say I was trying to cut him out of things but I\u2019d say that he cut himself out because he never expressed interest but again he said we \u201cnever\u201d asked. It went back and forth a lot that way\n\nHe\u2019s still talking to me via text but he\u2019s clearly upset with me and my cousin is upset too that we called him knowing he was at work", "created_utc": 1667608333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymf9pk/aita_for_booking_a_trip_with_my_cousin_versus_my/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I assume you\u2019re at least 21, so you\u2019ve known Blake a while. I assume you two are on very close terms. Why not discuss this with him before booking it? Yes, he is an AH in other situations, but it just sounds like he enjoys fun places, and Vegas is one of those fun places most people tend to enjoy. You could\u2019ve asked if he wanted to join, especially since it\u2019s during your birth month. I\u2019d certainly want to go on a trip like that with my fianc\u00e9e if it was her birth month. His feelings are rightfully hurt even if he is displaying it in a jealous way.", "How long have the two of you been together.  If a lengthy time then I would say YTA because who plans a trip without discussing it at least with their partner?  Whether or not you think he would want to go surely you\u2019d invite or at least mention it to him", "We didn\u2019t ask correctly so he realized that a proper plan was in the works, so I understand your judgment. Thanks!", "True! I knew the birth month might be a thing but I didn\u2019t anticipate it overwhelming everything else. I feel worse for ignoring that, because it shows he would have been willing to overlook distaste for Vegas for my sake. \n\nHe\u2019s previously expressed refusal to go to Vegas before we asked while planning. I\u2019ll edit my post to reflect that. Also *his. I\u2019m a dude", "We\u2019re a little over two years, since August. Again we did ask if he would want to go to Vegas while we were planning. But it wasn\u2019t a \u201cwe\u2019re going to go, do you want to go?\u201d so I get your point, truly.", "I still think YTA honestly. You still went and booked all of this without consulting him. I don\u2019t ever really care what my fiancee does, but if she planned a trip like that without telling I\u2019d be a little thrown off too. Maybe it\u2019s just because we live together and share finances, pets, etc.\u2014and I\u2019m not sure if you live with Blake\u2014it just seems disrespectful.", "We don\u2019t live together and we don\u2019t share finances. But you bringing up the matter of my birth month did give me another perspective (that I addressed in an edit to the above message so I apologize for that) and it would have been best if I had explicitly told him that I was going away"]}
