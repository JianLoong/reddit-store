One day a woman needed boxes but we didn't have any - she threw a huge tantrum in the front of the store demanding boxes and left in a huff when we STILL didn't have any. That day, my boss took the whole rack away and our policy changed to no boxes thanks to that one person.", "NTA and honestly it sounds like she feels entitled. A free ride is a gift and should come with a please and thank you and no argument over obeying the law!!", "NTA\n\nCustomer wanted to do something both illegal and dangerous, in your car.", "NTA - Your car, your rules. She doesn't like it she can arrange alternate transportation, and leaving a negative review when you were trying to go above and beyond to help her is an AH move.", "NTA, and tbh a policy change was probably warranted. If you had driven her and God forbid gotten into an accident and she was injured, that would have been completely on you/the company. She also sounds like someone who would make something up about you while you two were alone that nobody else is able to vouch for. This is all probably for the best.", "NTA. \n\nNo seatbelt, no ride.

Among other things, with it being your car, you have liability issues, so you have every right to demand a passenger wear a seat belt. And this was not a business service, but a personal favor.
