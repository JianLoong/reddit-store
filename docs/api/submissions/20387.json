Among other things, with it being your car, you have liability issues, so you have every right to demand a passenger wear a seat belt. And this was not a business service, but a personal favor.

It\u2019s unlikely you had any legal protection/insurance from the company you work for in the case of an accident or injury.

I wish I could have been there to watch events unfold when her Uber driver told her to buckle up.", "NTA. YOU could be ticketed for allowing a passenger in your car to not wear a seat belt, at least in my state. \n\nThis is why we cant have nice things.", "NTA.

Anyone not wearing a seat belt is endangering themselves, anyone else in the vehicle (flying bodies colliding with other riders), and pedestrians and bikers (ejected from vehicle and smashing into innocent 3rd parties).  With no seat belt, insurance can be void as well, making a financial nightmare.  I don't even start the engine if someone is not buckled.", "NTA. You offered to do her a favor, and she chose to be a total AH.", "In addition to that, it is fundamentally unsafe to _everyone else in the car_ to have one person without a seat belt.

Also, it doesn't matter about being ticketed.

The inventors of the three point belt (that almost all cars use now) at Volvo didn\u2019t single patent their invention because they wanted everyone who rode in every brand of car to be safe.

This led to me breaking both arms, as well as my nose when it hit the windshield.", "Funny story :(  The only time I didn't wear a seatbelt was when I was about 3 and a half months pregnant with my daughter. Bear in mind - this was thirty years ago, and I lived in a \\*very\\* rural area. Amazon was not a thing and getting seat belt extenders was just - neither easy nor something a person even really thought about. The way I was carrying made wearing a seatbelt \\*extremely\\* uncomfortable, sometimes painfully so. This would not be an issue later in the pregnancy. Why?\n\nBecause one day while driving me to work, my ex - who was in a pissy mood - was driving too fast and we hit a washout on a gravel road. The car went tail over teakettle and ended up in our neighbor's front yard, completely totaled. Every window shattered, top caved in, wheels bowed out, just - it looked like a broken Christmas tree ornament.  My ex, who was wearing a seatbelt, got off with a mild concussion.  I actually seemed all right, at first. I had some cuts, and I was \\*very\\* sore - but nothing broken. And then two days later I went into labor. Spent the rest of my pregnancy on bedrest because every time I stood up for more than a few minutes I went into labor. Bedrest isn't fun. Not after the first few days. At first everyone feels bad and pays you lots of attention but then life moves on and they do too. And you're left watching crappy daytime TV in rural nowheresville (remember, pre-Amazon. Damned near pre-Internet. Just let that sink in.)\n\nI'm in a wheelchair these days. It's a pretty nice electric wheelchair, goes zoom down the sidewalk. And the first goddamned thing I do when I get into it, is put on my seatbelt.", "Meat Missile should be a band name.", "This is the second post recently where some asshole refused to use a seatbelt. Both times, they were kicked out of the OP's car & used Uber instead. I've never used one of these services, but it seems strange to me that they wouldn't have a rule in place about riders wearing seat belts. Given how insurance will often bend over backward to find a reason not to pay a claim, this seems like a tailor-made loophole. Oh, they weren't wearing a seat belt? Guess we won't pay their medical bills. Too bad, so sad. NTA. It's not worth the risk.", "Where I live if the passenger is 18, its on them for not having a seatbelt.", "I used to be the exact same! I\u2019ve never told anyone that before. Very glad your comment is in the past tense, hope you\u2019re doing okay"]}
