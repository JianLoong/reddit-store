Who doesn't wear a seatbelt? \n\nI get that maybe that's a thing in taxis, but you're not a taxi. You don't have that kind of insurance. \n\nThe car doesn't move until all the riders are buckled in. Periodt.", "NTA - that's exactly the reason for the phrase \"no good deeds go unpunished.\"\n\nA long, long time ago I worked at a grocery store and we used to leave cardboard boxes out for people to take and use. One day a woman needed boxes but we didn't have any - she threw a huge tantrum in the front of the store demanding boxes and left in a huff when we STILL didn't have any. That day, my boss took the whole rack away and our policy changed to no boxes thanks to that one person.", "NTA and honestly it sounds like she feels entitled. A free ride is a gift and should come with a please and thank you and no argument over obeying the law!!", "NTA\n\nCustomer wanted to do something both illegal and dangerous, in your car.", "NTA - Your car, your rules. She doesn't like it she can arrange alternate transportation, and leaving a negative review when you were trying to go above and beyond to help her is an AH move.", "NTA, and tbh a policy change was probably warranted. If you had driven her and God forbid gotten into an accident and she was injured, that would have been completely on you/the company. She also sounds like someone who would make something up about you while you two were alone that nobody else is able to vouch for. This is all probably for the best.", "NTA. \n\nNo seatbelt, no ride.

Among other things, with it being your car, you have liability issues, so you have every right to demand a passenger wear a seat belt. And this was not a business service, but a personal favor. And, with this being a favor, she didn\u2019t have any room to be complaining or to negotiate. \n\nYour company was wise to change their policy to no rides for any reason.", "If you had driven her and ended up in an accident and she got hurt for not using the seatbelt you can bet your NTA ass she would be suing.", "NTA", "NTA and it\u2019s why I use a garage in easy walking distance from my home.

It\u2019s unlikely you had any legal protection/insurance from the company you work for in the case of an accident or injury. Not only were you essentially doing a favor but you were putting yourself at risk by transporting customers when you were off the clock.", "NTA. I wish I could have been there to watch events unfold when her Uber driver told her to buckle up.", "NTA. YOU could be ticketed for allowing a passenger in your car to not wear a seat belt, at least in my state. \n\nThis is why we cant have nice things.", "NTA.  Where I live, one\u2019s insurance is not valid unless everyone has on a seatbelt.  I\u2019ve seen catastrophic injuries that were not covered for that simple reason.", "Sounds like she didnt trust you (a stranger) in your personal car enough to be slowed down by  a seat belt.   NTA but i think i understand.", "NTA.  She was breaking the law.  What if an accident happened and she was hurt, you'd get sued for everything you have.  Either follow the law, or get the hell out.", "NTA your a really kind dude for offering the drive", "NTA.  I imagine wearing a seatbelt is the law?  It is where I live & even if it weren't, seatbelts do save lives.  You were doing a personal favor for her.  You don't owe her anything.  And there was nothing wrong with kicking her out for refusing to wear the seatbelt.", "NTA.  Anyone not wearing a seat belt is endangering themselves, anyone else in the vehicle (flying bodies colliding with other riders), and pedestrians and bikers (ejected from vehicle and smashing into innocent 3rd parties).  With no seat belt, insurance can be void as well, making a financial nightmare.  I don't even start the engine if someone is not buckled.", "NTA. You offered to do her a favor, and she chose to be a total AH.", "In addition to that, it is fundamentally unsafe to _everyone else in the car_ to have one person without a seat belt. In a high speed collision, they will turn into a 150 pound meat missile moving at 30+ miles an hour.\n\nIf, for example, Op got t-boned, the passenger could fit into Op, potentially hitting his head with hers.\n\nJust take a look at the first two crashes in [this video](https://youtu.be/9tPzALVSSvs).", " If you had driven her and God forbid gotten into an accident and she was injured, that would have been completely on you/the company.
