Before I had started the job, I mentioned to my mom that I wanted a new phone since mine was starting to fail me (Charger port busted and it was slower than molasses).\n\nShe said it would be fine if I bought myself a new one with my own money and I could pay for its expenses and what not.\n\nI thought, \"Cool. New phone that is my own and no longer on my mom's phone plan, let's do it.\"\n\nI order the phone and sign up for the phone plan, I get taken off the old one, and I now own my very own phone. \n\nAnyways, my step dad calls and I answer. He tells me that my mom wouldn't pick up the phone so he called me, hand the phone over to mom and she walks off with it to her bedroom.\n\nShe's always an overprotective helicopter parent so I already knew where this was going.

No.\"\nMom: \"Why not?\"\nMe: \"Because it's my property.\"\nMom: \"Fine.\"\n\nMom is disgruntled and upset but she ends up handing me back my phone.

I appreciate it. :)", "I do get that, yeah. However, my stepdad has the exact same phone as me.", "Living with someone does in no way entitle you to access their private information.

Or lock your phone if you are handling it off for any reason.  Stops snoopers in their tracks.", "NTA. Next time they try to pull that stunt, tell step-dad you'll have her call him. DO NOT HAND HER YOUR PHONE! Password & biometric locks on the phone, plus apparently, there's a way to also password protect individual apps.

She should not search through your phone. You're an adult and you pay for the phone.\n\nAs a parent, your mom is supposed to give \"you roots and wings.\" I (57F) will tell you it is not easy, but it is necessary.

Answer the phone while locked with either PIN or fingerprint access?? Can't be unlocked after the call and things stay secure!", "Stepdad: I called your mom but she isn't answering can you let me talk to her?\nYou: Sure!
