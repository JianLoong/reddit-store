Before I had started the job, I mentioned to my mom that I wanted a new phone since mine was starting to fail me (Charger port busted and it was slower than molasses).\n\nShe said it would be fine if I bought myself a new one with my own money and I could pay for its expenses and what not.\n\nI thought, \"Cool. New phone that is my own and no longer on my mom's phone plan, let's do it.\"\n\nI order the phone and sign up for the phone plan, I get taken off the old one, and I now own my very own phone. \n\nAnyways, my step dad calls and I answer. He tells me that my mom wouldn't pick up the phone so he called me, hand the phone over to mom and she walks off with it to her bedroom.\n\nShe's always an overprotective helicopter parent so I already knew where this was going. Mom gets done with the phone call and she starts messing with it and I stop her. \n\nMe: \"Woah. No.\"\nMom: \"Why not?\"\nMe: \"Because it's my property.\"\nMom: \"Fine.\"\n\nMom is disgruntled and upset but she ends up handing me back my phone.
