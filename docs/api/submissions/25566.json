{"id": 25566, "submission_id": "1620xle", "title": "AITA for leaving much less money to my older daughter because I paid for her college fees?", "selftext": "Hello people of Reddit.. I could use some advice. I have gotten myself into a huge argument with my daughter about my will. I\u2019m in my early 60s and thought it was time to make a will, I\u2019m not going to last much longer (apologies for the dark humor) - so I decided I will leave about 2/3 of my savings to my younger daughter and about 1/3 to my older daughter. My husband and I want to sell our house and use the money to travel once we retire, so that isn\u2019t an issue. \n\nMy reasoning for this is that my older daughter wanted to attend a good college when she was younger. She asked me if I would pay and I agreed. I paid the full tuition and she did not get into any debt, I believe this has helped her get a head start in life. My younger daughter did not want to attend college and instead became a full time artist out of high school. She has a decently successful online business, and does not make great money but has achieved her longtime dream. \n\nI think that since I have already made a sizable financial contribution to my older daughter\u2019s life, it is only fair that I leave more money for my younger daughter. I\u2019ve discussed this with my husband and he completely agrees. But my older daughter thinks this is unfair, because I would have paid my for younger daughter\u2019s college too if she wanted, and she thinks it is unfair that I am \u201cpunishing\u201d her for wanting to go to college. She says that I paid for her college tuition as a gift, and it is ridiculous of me to keep accounts like this. \n\nFor context, the amount I paid for her college fees was about the same as 1/3 of my savings now (counting inflation) so it evens itself out. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1693070337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1620xle/aita_for_leaving_much_less_money_to_my_older/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it's a way that is destroying your relationship with your older daughter and destroying the relationship between your two daughters.\n\nFirst, it would have been better not to disclose this plan now. Second, if you paid for your older daughter's tuition, and want to give a similar gift to your younger daughter, you can start giving her some cash gifts now to equal that amount. Then your estate can be divided equally between the two daughters. If you can't afford to give that money now, then word your will in a way that gives your younger daughter an amount equal to what you would have given her for tuition, and then divide the remainder equally.\n\nYou might not die for another 20-30 years and during that time, your assets might increase in value to the point that you are giving your younger daughter significantly more than the tuition payment was.", "NTA doesn't matter of she agrees or not, its your money your choice.", "In a lot of ways it would have been nice to give your younger daughter a sort of artist\u2019s stipend to help her get established, which would also have avoided this issue. \n\nI\u2019d make the amount to your second daughter the specific amount you spent on her college, plus inflation, with the balance 5050. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is N A H. If your younger daughter was just a dropout maybe, but as it is she followed her vocation and has made a profession out of it. I would say not giving her money was punishing _ her_ for not doing what society wants and going to college. Your older daughter on the other hand wants to have her cake and eat it. NTA, therefore.", "NTA. You could give the younger daughter the money that equals the college costs now and then split everything 50/50 in the will if you have the funds. Regardless, your older daughter has no say in how you leave your money. If she continues to argue about it, you could suggest that you leave her nothing.", "NTA.\n\nYour money, your will.\n\nI recommend a written and video WILL with your lawyer to make it iron clad. \n\nYou can also deduct her tuition cost first then split the remainder.

You can give everything to charity or to that one person you met that one time who was so unbelievably kind to you in your time of need.

It seems as though you never made it clear that when you paid for her college, that meant it was going to take away from her in the future. So she\u2019s being a bit blindsided here. I get her frustration as she had no idea something that happened years ago would have a negative affect on her now. But again, at the end of the day, it\u2019s your money and no one has any right to tell you have to spend it or how to share it with others. Hope everything works out with you all.", "NTA\n\nIt your money and decision. It appears to be logical and well thought out.", "NTA. Your older daughter sounds very entitled and seems to have no issue \"punishing\" her sister for not going to college.\n\nGiving the younger daughter the college amount upfront as a contribution to her business and then splitting the rest 50/50 might change the optics to make her drop her objections. If she still complains after that, then it's all about the money and perhaps her share should be eliminated instead.", "NTA. Older daughters logic is faulty. If you had paid for younger daughters college, then the \"pot\" would be reduced accordingly. So... assuming in that scenario, your will would be a 50/50 split, older daughter would be getting the same amount.\n\nI think she's upset with the optics of this, but logically your plan makes sense to me.\n\nCan she be persuaded by math?", "NTA because it's your money.

She'll basically end up having paid for it herself.\n\nHave you ever mentioned those consequences to her?\n\nNAH", "YTA, you are penalising your daughter for her ambition and success. Your daughter chose her path knowing she would not earn as much.

My parents have done a similar thing with me and my sister. They set aside money for us to use once we graduated high school, and gave us the responsibility of how to use it. For travel, college, down payment on a house, car, or whatever else. My sister went to college and used her money there. I didn't know what to do out of high school, so I saved the money and got a job for a few years until I found what I wanted to do. It helped me get a huge head start on student debt.\n\n\n\nI've never felt like my parents gave more to me or my sister, they just helped where help was needed. If that means spending more on my sister than me, then that's fine. \n\n\n\nI don't know what your family dynamic is like, but she either feels like she's genuinely being treated unfairly, or is being entitled to what she thinks is hers. It sounds like you spoiled your kids a bit (not a criticism, I applaud you for doing so much for your kids) and maybe your eldest has just come to expect a lot from you over the years.\n\n\n\nEither way, you're not in the wrong.

Have a talk with daughter and explain she wanted a nice college that cost X. While younger daughter could\u2019ve done the same. You are trying to be fair in the long run. \nIt is always sad to read family fight for assets, at least you know to expect when you do pass. Try to fix it now.", "You are allowed to do whatever you want with your money.\n\nAn inheritance is a gift, no child should expect one.\n\nI think you are trying very hard to be fair to both your children.  One got an debt free education that other did not.  That type of helps  makes a difference.\n\nYou could just give your younger daughter (perhaps over time, to make tax free) the equivalent money that tuition would have been has she gone to college.\n\nThen you could go 50/ 50 with the inheritance.\n\nNTA either way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Besides, it is your money to do as you please.  Your daughter is acting entitled and she is only entitled to what you deem fair to her.", "NTA, It would be unfair if you paid match money for the older daughter's college and the other one didn't get anything because they didn't also choose to spend it in an expensive art school.", "I think it sounds reasonable.

Did she know she would get less when you died if you paid for her college?

Punishing her by paying her entire college tuition so she could enter her career debt-free?", "This is a massive overreaction to what OP has told us. The daughter doesn\u2019t seem excessively greedy. She just seems confused and frustrated on why something that happened years ago, and without any prior communication as to what any consequences might be as a result of them paying for her college would be. They failed to communicate to her what type of \u201cgift\u201d the college fund would be. They still don\u2019t owe her the inheritance at the end of the day, but the daughter isn\u2019t entirely in the wrong for feeling as she does.", "She also \"received\" money, that she chose to spend on a college education. She even called it a gift.", "And? She made this about the money she already received being a gift to help her through college. This would be a gift to help younger sister through...whatever. This makes the two sisters explicitly equal.", "It's not particularly fair to set the terms of the gift after the money has been used. I think other people itt have made some good suggestions to even things out.

You never really know what's gonna happen.", ">It's pretty clear. In OP's older daughter's words, she received a \"gift\"\n\nIt doesn't sound like a loan. \n\n>Her younger sister can now get an equally expensive gift in the form of a larger inheritance \n\nBut a flat split of the inheritance might not end up being an equally expensive gift. \n\n>(or get the money upfront).\n\nAdjusted for inflation, this would be the equitable solution and would allow them to split the inheritence 50/50.\n\nWhere I live we've had people win cases because parents didn't split the inheritance fairly, dunno about where OP lives but this could avoid more issues down the line.", "Why don\u2019t you give your younger child the money equivalent to the college tuition you gave your older child now? Then put 50/50 in will", "I kinda think esh because your daughter doesn't get to dictate how you leave your money, but she is right. You are punishing her for going to college and that's not right. Your younger daughter is doing ok so half and half even now wouldn't hurt either one.", ">but the daughter isn\u2019t entirely in the wrong for feeling as she does.\n\nIt seems that this is the point where we have absolutely contrary opinions.", "I know, but I'm guessing OP wants to do everything in her power to not cause issues between their children.", "Legally that's what it is called. Unless she is expected to pay it back?", "Again, nobody at that point knew what the younger daughter would do, I'm guessing everyone thought she would go to college and then the same thing would be done for her, so there was no reason to plan for alternatives. As to \"well it might end up not being exactly equal\" - that's fine imo. You don't have to split everything down to the penny, older sister got to go to college and hasn't paid interest on loans - are we supposed to calculate that in as well just to make it extra fair?", "OP said they did the calculations and it came out the same. But I agree, it'd be best to settle it upfront to avoid unplanned money fluctuations and discussion.", "Hah. That's a fantastic idea. Effectively the same as what OP is proposing, but significantly changes how it looks/feels.", " if the money is split 50/50 now they would be punishing the younger daughter for NOT going to college.\n\nA full ride to school is not a punishment,", "Seems to be. I think the daughter is in the wrong regardless of her feelings. But just about anyone would have similar feelings to being told that there are consequences to what was assumed to be a \u201cgift\u201d you received years ago. Her issue isn\u2019t that she has these feelings. No one can help how they feel. The issue is that she is showing entitlement over someone else\u2019s money.", "Indeed, so she should not be upset about her younger sister getting a gift in the same amount.", ">Again, nobody at that point knew what the younger daughter would do, I'm guessing everyone thought she would go to college and then the same thing would be done for her, so there was no reason to plan for alternatives\n\nWhich is why she should probably get an inflation adjusted amount now if possible. And when she didn't go to college they probably should have have given her money to help get her business off the ground instead. It'd be much easier than trying to litigate this through a solicitor after she's dead. \n\n>As to \"well it might end up not being exactly equal\" - that's fine imo.

It doesn't have to be right down the middle but it sounds like this parent is trying to at least be equitable.", "No. Because they are using inflation instead of what college would have cost when the younger went. They should give her that amount that they would have paid then, then divide the rest in half.", "If that's what she was getting upset about you'd have a point.", "Sounds like the parents shouldn't have paid for college and just split up the inheritance 50/50 then. Older daughter is the kind of person that you do favors for and end up being indebted to somehow.
