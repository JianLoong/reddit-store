I could use some advice. I have gotten myself into a huge argument with my daughter about my will. I\u2019m in my early 60s and thought it was time to make a will, I\u2019m not going to last much longer (apologies for the dark humor) - so I decided I will leave about 2/3 of my savings to my younger daughter and about 1/3 to my older daughter. My husband and I want to sell our house and use the money to travel once we retire, so that isn\u2019t an issue. \n\nMy reasoning for this is that my older daughter wanted to attend a good college when she was younger. She asked me if I would pay and I agreed. I paid the full tuition and she did not get into any debt, I believe this has helped her get a head start in life. My younger daughter did not want to attend college and instead became a full time artist out of high school. She has a decently successful online business, and does not make great money but has achieved her longtime dream. \n\nI think that since I have already made a sizable financial contribution to my older daughter\u2019s life, it is only fair that I leave more money for my younger daughter. I\u2019ve discussed this with my husband and he completely agrees. But my older daughter thinks this is unfair, because I would have paid my for younger daughter\u2019s college too if she wanted, and she thinks it is unfair that I am \u201cpunishing\u201d her for wanting to go to college. She says that I paid for her college tuition as a gift, and it is ridiculous of me to keep accounts like this. \n\nFor context, the amount I paid for her college fees was about the same as 1/3 of my savings now (counting inflation) so it evens itself out. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1693070337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1620xle/aita_for_leaving_much_less_money_to_my_older/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What about her younger sister being punished for NOT wanted to go to college?! \n\nOP, the best you can do is calculate all you've spend with older daughter while at college and give to the youngest now (or soon as you can)!

On further enquiry, we discovered a conflict of interest (the older son was my milkman), and he was referred to another firm.\n\nAfter his father died, his milkman son thanked me for the advice I had given his father BEFORE the conflict had become apparent. I only knew my milkman by his first name and the name he traded under, so the fact that his father had approached our firm was not something that was immediately apparent. My son was also employed as Malachai\u2019s assistant on the round, so the possible conflict of interest was more than just \u201cborderline\u201d and I was so glad that I had dug more than just basic details about Malachai\u2019s milk round.

A few years ago I did the math and buying a place 2x the size of the studio I was renting would have a cheaper mortgage than my rent was. I was ready to take on the responsibility of owning.

I had recently gotten a significant pay raise with a promotion so I could have saved up over the next couple of years and bought a place then. But after talking it over with my parents and showing them my details they offered to gift me the rest of the down payment (and I could instead put some of that additional raise I would have had to save towards my 401k and use the rest to make sure I didn\u2019t fully deplete my savings). At the time they mentioned that they would make a note in their will that their money would be split between my brothers and I but that my portion would be minus the gift amount and that if they did something like this for my brothers they would handle it the same way. It\u2019s worked just fine for all of us.\n\nIt\u2019s too late for you to make that deal upfront so instead see what the math would look like when you take the difference in college costs into account (don\u2019t split hairs about NPV, interest, the return on her education or whatever). Is it really 1/6 of what your daughters will be splitting? If it is, then your money your choice and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong at all.
