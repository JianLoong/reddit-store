{"id": 25566, "submission_id": "1620xle", "title": "AITA for leaving much less money to my older daughter because I paid for her college fees?", "selftext": "Hello people of Reddit.. I could use some advice. I have gotten myself into a huge argument with my daughter about my will. I\u2019m in my early 60s and thought it was time to make a will, I\u2019m not going to last much longer (apologies for the dark humor) - so I decided I will leave about 2/3 of my savings to my younger daughter and about 1/3 to my older daughter. My husband and I want to sell our house and use the money to travel once we retire, so that isn\u2019t an issue. \n\nMy reasoning for this is that my older daughter wanted to attend a good college when she was younger. She asked me if I would pay and I agreed. I paid the full tuition and she did not get into any debt, I believe this has helped her get a head start in life. My younger daughter did not want to attend college and instead became a full time artist out of high school. She has a decently successful online business, and does not make great money but has achieved her longtime dream. \n\nI think that since I have already made a sizable financial contribution to my older daughter\u2019s life, it is only fair that I leave more money for my younger daughter. I\u2019ve discussed this with my husband and he completely agrees. But my older daughter thinks this is unfair, because I would have paid my for younger daughter\u2019s college too if she wanted, and she thinks it is unfair that I am \u201cpunishing\u201d her for wanting to go to college. She says that I paid for her college tuition as a gift, and it is ridiculous of me to keep accounts like this. \n\nFor context, the amount I paid for her college fees was about the same as 1/3 of my savings now (counting inflation) so it evens itself out. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1693070337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1620xle/aita_for_leaving_much_less_money_to_my_older/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless she is expected to pay it back?", "Again, nobody at that point knew what the younger daughter would do, I'm guessing everyone thought she would go to college and then the same thing would be done for her, so there was no reason to plan for alternatives.

Effectively the same as what OP is proposing, but significantly changes how it looks/feels.", " if the money is split 50/50 now they would be punishing the younger daughter for NOT going to college.\n\nA full ride to school is not a punishment,", "Seems to be. I think the daughter is in the wrong regardless of her feelings. But just about anyone would have similar feelings to being told that there are consequences to what was assumed to be a \u201cgift\u201d you received years ago. Her issue isn\u2019t that she has these feelings. No one can help how they feel. The issue is that she is showing entitlement over someone else\u2019s money.", "Indeed, so she should not be upset about her younger sister getting a gift in the same amount.", ">Again, nobody at that point knew what the younger daughter would do, I'm guessing everyone thought she would go to college and then the same thing would be done for her, so there was no reason to plan for alternatives\n\nWhich is why she should probably get an inflation adjusted amount now if possible. And when she didn't go to college they probably should have have given her money to help get her business off the ground instead.

What about her younger sister being punished for NOT wanted to go to college?! \n\nOP, the best you can do is calculate all you've spend with older daughter while at college and give to the youngest now (or soon as you can)! Not when you died. You gifted (as she said) the older one with free college, so now you gift the younger one with the same amount. This way when you died both get 50% and no one will feel betrayed by you or jelous of the other one.", "NTA, your daughter is being ridiculous.

He (the father) had discovered that he had cancer, and because he had funded his older son\u2019s purchase of his milk franchise he felt it was only fair to give his younger son an equivalent (after inflation) larger share of his estate. On further enquiry, we discovered a conflict of interest (the older son was my milkman), and he was referred to another firm.\n\nAfter his father died, his milkman son thanked me for the advice I had given his father BEFORE the conflict had become apparent. I only knew my milkman by his first name and the name he traded under, so the fact that his father had approached our firm was not something that was immediately apparent. My son was also employed as Malachai\u2019s assistant on the round, so the possible conflict of interest was more than just \u201cborderline\u201d and I was so glad that I had dug more than just basic details about Malachai\u2019s milk round.

Then enjoy your retirement and split any \u2018leftovers\u2019 50/50", "I'm assuming your older daughter didn't major in math.  So had you hypothetically paid for your younger daughter's tuition as a \"gift\" there would be less money in the savings account to be divided so your elder daughter would get pretty much the same amount of money either way.\n\nHow about this.  Leave your younger daughter the amount you gave your older daughter (adjusted for inflation)  and the split the remaining money equally between them.  OR gift (or create a trust for) your younger daughter the same amount that you gave your elder daughter now and then in your will split the savings account equally. \n\nNTA but your older daughter is one in addition to being greedy.", "NTA.  Last I checked you said it is YOUR money so you do what you think is right.  If your older daughter is that spiteful then fine,  give your younger daughter the college money NOW and then leave the rest to split 50/50", "NTA \n\nPlease remind your daughter that choosing to leave them anything is a gift!!\n\nA friend of mine made the mistake of telling her children what was in her will and the fighting began. Imagine their surprise when she died, the will was read and she left it all to charity. She left them a letter saying she was disgusted with them all.", "NTA but may I make a suggestion based on my personal experience. A few years ago I did the math and buying a place 2x the size of the studio I was renting would have a cheaper mortgage than my rent was. I was ready to take on the responsibility of owning. But, I only had about half of what I\u2019d need for a good down payment. My credit is great. I had recently gotten a significant pay raise with a promotion so I could have saved up over the next couple of years and bought a place then. But after talking it over with my parents and showing them my details they offered to gift me the rest of the down payment (and I could instead put some of that additional raise I would have had to save towards my 401k and use the rest to make sure I didn\u2019t fully deplete my savings). At the time they mentioned that they would make a note in their will that their money would be split between my brothers and I but that my portion would be minus the gift amount and that if they did something like this for my brothers they would handle it the same way. It\u2019s worked just fine for all of us.\n\nIt\u2019s too late for you to make that deal upfront so instead see what the math would look like when you take the difference in college costs into account (don\u2019t split hairs about NPV, interest, the return on her education or whatever). Is it really 1/6 of what your daughters will be splitting? If it is, then your money your choice and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong at all. If it isn\u2019t, rethink the split.", "gift tax would be a problem if amount exceeds cap, which i think is $34k per year.  but you can break the 1/3 up over multiple years.  check with an estate attorney, of course.", "Spend it all", "Gift the younger daughter and leave the rest to charity. Older daughter gets nothing (more).", "This is a great answer", "In terms of disclosing the plan, I\u2019m in my early 30s and in my late 20s my parents sat just me down (since I would be their executor) and walked me through their wills. I have documents with their lawyers contact info, account numbers for all their financial accounts, etc. Personally I\u2019ve found it very reassuring to know ahead of time. My dad really struggled being his parents executor when they left almost no information ahead of time.\n\nNo judgement, just a different perspective", "It's a lifetime exemption,right now is 12.92 million. I doubt that's the case here.  I'm a tax accountant, so source approved.", "Absolutely agree. Even if people don\u2019t like the answers, it\u2019s nice to have them rather than wondering what someone who is no longer there was thinking.", "They could tell you all that, but NOT tell you what the breakdown is for inheritances.", "Then that\u2019s implying that it\u2019s reasonable that she\u2019d be shocked, no?", "I said in another comment that OP probably doesn't want to make problems between their daughters. The sisters might not care, but OP probably does.", "If OP is upfront about it, what would be the problem? If the older daughter still objects to a 50/50 split with her younger sister getting the college amount upfront, it's all about greed and there is no fixing the situation.", "For now it is. I doubt OP is going to stop saving or the bank paying interest. She could live for another 30 years and that language in the will could end up biting her in the butt. \n\nYeah, definitely best to even things out sooner rather than later. Wills are awful things really. They bring out the worst in many people.", "Indirectly, she is. She feels she's getting financially punished for her tuition gift because her sister would get an equal amount in extra inheritance. She calls it \"keeping accounts\", as if it were a more expensive doll she once got for her birthday.\n\nTo me, her reaction and behaviour sound like she just wants to double dip and not have to directly admit it. I hope OP goes with the proposed solution of settling it upfront to circumvent this."]}
