She said that raising children was what she wanted more than anything in the world and she was adamant that it was best for her to stay at home to raise the children, citing studies and statistics from numerous countries. We decided to try for children and were lucky enough that she fell pregnant. During her pregnancy she repeatedly told friends and family how she was going to be a stay at home mum.\n\nShortly after Son1 was born, my wife decided she no longer wanted to be a stay at home mum. She had a career that offers progression, whereas I just had jobs.

We are completely financially secure; we own our house with no mortgage, we own an additional property that we let (both purchased equally after marrying) and we have savings.\n\nThose 3 months have obviously gone but I'm now very close to being in a position to start looking for work in my friend's industry. Part of that delay is multiple holidays, part is me doing lots of home improvements, part is me getting myself back in shape after 5 years of not having time, and part is it just taking longer than I anticipated. For the entirety of this time, my wife has repeatedly stated that I'm lazy and clearly don't want to work, and that I should just go back to my old line of work.\n\nIt came up this morning and I said that I've supported her career for years and that, if we were to begin to struggle financially, then I would immediately go back to my old work but, since we can afford to, could I not just spend a little longer trying to line up a career for myself that I'd enjoy.

She was working too.", "Who do you think you are talking to lol", "How does the expert\u2019s opinion mean *less* than OP\u2019s wife\u2019s tho?", "Exactly!", "Let me just start with, I believe in burnout and no marriage is 100% a 50/50 partnership. And at times, a partner has to give more at times and expects their partner to do the same. You\u2019re not a AH for wanting more support. \nI think the bigger problems your wife might be having is A. You decided to brag in your post about \u201cgetting in shape\u201d which is great but to your wife Shows you haven\u2019t been working at this goal as you are trying to be, B. Call me crazy but what holidays other than Easter or Ramadan that require time off which means your holidays were more likely vacations which once again points to you not taking this seriously, C. You don\u2019t mention getting certifications or completing coding courses which would actually give you a heads up in the industry. On Many jobs you will apply for you won\u2019t make it pass the hr software - aka you can be the best coder in the world but unless you have (insert certification ) for example adobe certification or google cloud - you won\u2019t make it pass the filters looking for those qualifications or degrees . \n\nI\u2019m not gonna judge but from the outside it looks like you haven\u2019t really been taking the three months as seriously as you should have been.  As for your wife , take a look at her perspective- you quit your job, start working out, have not finished your \u201clanguage studies\u201d and don\u2019t have a serious career path only hoping that your buddy is right. It sounds and looks like a midlife crisis. Best advice is to get some real certifications or go to a coding boot camp which also has connections in the industry you are looking at. As for right now I\u2019m gonna say ESH", "NTA.  Sometimes things take longer than anticipated.  You have been very generous with her very sudden change of heart; she should give you more time and a better attitude.", ">during the current wave of tech layoffs\n\nThere is no current wave of tech layoffs. There were some layoffs at a handful of big, well known companies, but overall the industry has been adding jobs.", "Hahahah...I thought it was OP...but it still stands.
