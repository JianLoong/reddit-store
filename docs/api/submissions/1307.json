I'm working tomorrow and cannot call in sick as I was down with the flu for a while and I am in desperate need for money as I will be moving. Anyways, my Nephew (4m) got ill, he is staying in hospital with my brother's wife and my brother works so he asked me. I said I can't as I also have work. I offered for him to drop them over at mine so my mum can care till I get home but he refused which is fine. He then proceeded to ask again and I said once again I'm working there's nothing I can do, he will just have to skip work the same way he wanted me to skip. He ignored my messaged\n\nJust now, I called his wife and she started screaming at me, because I could hear my nephew crying and didn't want to stay in the phone because I felt bad. Anyways she calmed down and said she wants to go home and we spoke a bit which was fine. Even though why are you screaming at me? Go scream at your husband. I texted my brother to check on the other two and he starts having a go at me saying I can only text and do nothing else. Lmao, they have an emergency every damn month and I would babysit every damn time because his MIL refused (WHICH I UNDERSTAND). \n\nAnyways, AITA because I couldn't not go work to babysit so he missed his work instead?", "created_utc": 1667594983, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yma0u7/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_niece_and_nephew/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
