Maybe be careful with his limits if you didn't talk about this.", "NTA - assuming you had talked to a previois domanatrix i assume for him its heavily based in kink, so i would be careful with how widely your sharing all that info without him knowing.", "I\u2019d be terrified that my house is covered in cameras, he\u2019s stealing my underthings, and that he will end up murdering me in my sleep and making a life sized love doll out of my skin leather.

Just because your friends don't understand the pleasure he gets from it, doesn't mean you're taking advantage of him. Sounds like a consensual, mutually beneficial arrangement all around that anyone can end at any time if they choose. Not seeing the problem here.", "In principle NTA.\n\nHowever, it is a strange arrangement and I think it might not be a moral thing to keep doing? \n1. Maybe at some point this thing turns from a one-sided kink to something more obsessive and all of a sudden you have a stalker \n2. It might be that he has no control over his kink. I mean he works a second job to pay your rent. That is kinda self-destructive and maybe you are enabling him? \nThink about that. I mean, you basically have your hands in his pockets. He offered, but I think it is a bir sketchy to just go along with it ... ? \n\nIf it would only be about cleaning the apartment, i would say 'very weird, but whatever, do what you guys like and be happy.\" Here, other consequences kinda loom in the background (maybe).\n\nEdit: I mean ypu are kinda like his boss. A boss should care about the well-being of her employees, right?", "YTA\n\nYou know this is exploitative. Just because he's exploiting himself doesn't mean you have to help him. The cleaning is one thing - still in kink territory, but paying your rent sounds like a fin-dom arrangement he's imposed on himself but can't afford. This means we are out of kink territory and into actual harm territory.", "YTA. Sorry. It would be one thing if he were some member of the extended royal family with money to burn but he\u2019s working a second job to pay your rent? That\u2019s messed up. \n\nPlus the guy is mentally ill and you\u2019ve got him hanging out in your apartment.", "NTA - He wanted it and he is comfortable with it so I dont see the problem. Yeah its strange but that doesn't make it AH.", "NTA - sorta  \n\n\nYou're taking advantage of his mental issue.  \nI'm not saying there's anything wrong with somebody's kink but it \\*is something in their mind that gets them to do things they wouldn't do otherwise (like pay your rent for the privilege of cleaning your apt).  \n\n\nEssentially this isn't different than providing any other service to a specific clientele.  \n\n\nThe point somebody made about possibly having an instant ready made stalker might be worth considering though.", "NTA\n\nThis arrangement is hilarious. They may think you are an asshole but you both seem to be happy with the arrangement. Who are they to judge either of you. \n\nI do hope you have a contract in place with the sub tho. Also whenever he is at your house, make sure someone not too far away from you knows he is with you. Just because he is a stranger after all, you never know.", "NTA. This is a consensual arrangement. Whilst his benefit is non-traditional, it works for him!", "I would not have told anyone of this arrangement. Not out of shame or guilt but out of fear that they would try to lure him away from me.

As crazy as it sounds this is sexwork ( without the sex).", "You're prolly gonna get cut up, cooked, and end up eaten...", "yeah, i am sure they are hidden cams all over your place.  ask your guys friend whether they recognize you on one of the more darker porn site.", "NTA, but I hope he is stealing your panties or something weird like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you want moral qualms, you are catering to his kink, which is not sexually or morally offensive, so if I were you I'd enjoy the situation.", "NTA - No one is being harmed, coerced, or is otherwise compromising on their morals. If that arrangement works for y'all, there's no reason to change it. I wish someone would pay my bills in return for allowing them to clean my house! \n\nYour friends need to butt out of things that don't concern them.", "Jeez\n\nNTA \n\nThis is a kink(of sorts, not that vanilla people would usually understand), there are subs that just want to clean as their service to their Dom. As long as you vetted him and he came with a reference and it's a consensual act. You aren't exploiting him any more than he wants to be exploited. Obviously there are things to talk about before hand and agree/disagree like any other kink. But it sounds like you have already gone through that. \n\nIt's no different that a findom and no one ever has a problem with that.", "Nta, tell your friends they're kink shaming, or slut shaming. I'm not sure.", "I would check for hidden cam.", "Yes! That was exactly my point like I didn\u2019t ask for any of it", "Yeah I did talk to him about it at the start and he said he was okay with my friends knowing and even on the weekend I let him know my friends were over at mine", "Yeah I did check with him at the start and he said he was okay with my friends knowing!", "Yeah I think they don\u2019t get the dynamic, to a certain I\u2019m not sure either, but it\u2019s definitely consensual and it was initiated by him as well so idk", "How is it mutually beneficial when he's working two jobs? He's a student, how can he study while doing this? When does he even sleep? What else us he going without while he's pouring all his time and money into a fetish? He seriously sounds unwell, and this is bordering on self harm.", "Yeah I think this is sorta what my friends meant too like is it ethical for me to allow it but I\u2019m also not responsible for him like I didn\u2019t invite any of it. I can\u2019t just assume the responsibility, so I see it as it being his choice", "It is kinda findom arrangement but it\u2019s because that\u2019s what he specifically wanted. I didn\u2019t ask him to do this or give him an amount. He chose all of it and chooses tj stick to it", "To be fair I didn\u2019t know about the second job but even still it\u2019s still his call, I never asked him to do any of it.", "I\u2019m not sure I understand how can it be both that I\u2019m taking advantage of someone but it also it be that I\u2019m providing a service he specifically asked for \n\nBut yes the stalker thing is very much an issue", "Yeah my sister knows about it and I let her know! But I don\u2019t have a contract outside of like the messages between him and I, what would a contract even say?", "I\u2019m really surprised that none of my friends have wanted that for themselves but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll happen once the shock goes away", "Yeah it did take me a while to realise that but yeah I only told my friends bc he said he was okay with it but Dede will be more low key about it", "@op agreeing to is even more strange.", "you made sure beforehand that he is okay with the situation, which is really great! you're NTA for being in a consenting D/s dynamic. still you didn't ask your friends for consent with being in a kink related situation. moving forward i would either ask people if they are okay with witnessing him cleaning your apartment, tell them you'll clean when they are gone & then call him over or just clean up with your friends without your sub", "Now seeing their reaction, best not to share it further", "Some people love to keep busy. I was like that. I wouldn't feel good relaxing. I would also have too much energy to sleep if I wasn't busy all day. During college i also had 2 part time jobs and it was fine. I had enough time to get the normal amount of sleep. I had enough time to keep up with school. I also had enough time to do housekeeping and to see my friends frequently. If you keep things clean you are done fairly fast. Also whatever free time I did have, I had enough money to do whatever I wanted because of the two jobs. \n\nWhat he gets out of it is for him to know. Just cuz we don't understand doesn't mean it's necessarily unhealthy. Laying on his couch feeling depressed not being able to do what makes him happy sounds more unhealthy to me. Maybe the sub is already in therapy to try and deal with whatever struggles they face and this is their coping mechanism currently keeping them stable.\n\nOP is being safe, someone else close by knows when he is in her house and they seem to have laid down their grounds quite clearly. Tho they should have a contract in place. But other than that, it seems okay.", ">bordering on self harm\n\nI really don't think that's an accurate description of the situation.\n\nHe's paying a young lady for access to her dirty laundry. You might think the price is too high, or you might think he's devoting too much time to it, but \"self-harm\" is a real stretch.", "Does that make OP TA though? We can't help people that can't help themselves. \n\nI'm just impressed OP actually connected with his dom. He might be saving money just paying rent to OP instead of the price of a pro dominatrix for extended hours. \n\nI hate to say this but getting married might even be cheaper for him\ud83d\ude05\n\nOP NTA, but if he's doing a good job, give the man a discount on your rent.", "Well, i mean you did invite to some degree? I mean you consent to basically being his boss and getting paid, you just did not initiate. He is your servant by your consent. So there is some responsibility on your shoulders for his well-being, like it or not. \nI mean if you want a perspective and you trust that person to have his best interest at heart, too, talk again to his dominatrix? (If she is dependend on him paying her, I would however not really trust her to make a fair assessment). \n\nPersonally, I would kinda draw the line at him paying (to be fair, i wouldnt let him clean either because that is just not how I swing) and maybe just talk to him that you fear he his putting his well-being at risk? I mean i get that this is benefical and someine else paying your rent is awesome, but I think you kinda enable self-destructive behaviour. \nAlso, how is the whole consent? Can he say no? Can he always drop out? Do you order him around? Etc. Etc. \nMaybe you should ask in a BDSM-Sub what they think of that whole thing, including him having a second job. They probably know situations like this, and the dangers for you or him and how to make it safe and what responsibilities you have as his dom (which you basically are, even if the whole thing is no more sexual for you than a rock).", "You're 100% profiting from his vulnerability.", "\u2026the dealer said to the addict", "Just all the terms you both agree to. What is expected of you as the Dom and what is expected of the Sub. Stuff like if the sub will still pay rent if dom was to go on a vacation or would be unavailable for any other reason. The amount the sub is paying should be put on record. How often your arrangement should be reevaluated.\n\nIf you were to break the arrangement you never know how he takes it. Might come after you and claim you abused him. It's good that you have texts as proof, it's even better to have a written and signed contract. \n\nThe internet is full of info, I'm sure there's a subreddit or some kind of community that has guides to help you get a contract set up.", "Whats his end game?  He trying to woo you?", "how is it strange to as a young college student, take an offer for your entire rent to be paid and your apartment cleaned? \n\nhe clearly is doing this because it\u2019s a fetish of his but there\u2019s no reason why op would say no when that\u2019s an amazing deal", "Yeah I\u2019m definitely keep it more low key from now on", "If someone is doing something that's actively harmful to themselves, you can just not help them do it. You certainly don't need to profit from it.", "I do know like what he specifically wants in terms of how to treat him and stuff so that part is covered but the part about responsibility, I get what you mean like it\u2019s kinda implied given the arrangement but idk how do I manage it given it\u2019s his choice", "I am profiting but from what vulnerability?", "Oh dang thanks for the info I\u2019ll look into getting something written up, thanks!", "It\u2019s listen here d-rated onlyfans reject. If she want to how her self that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s strange to put it on the internet. Y\u2019all need Jesus", "Maybe ask in a bdsm sub. These are the guys with the expertise ;)", "Is anything noticeably... off with this guy? Is there any chance your friends think you're taking advantage of him?", "This isn't just harmless fun if it's at a point where his life is being dominated by this - and it is. He's working two jobs, he's at your beck and call, even your friends are saying this isn't right.", "I didn\u2019t get the impression anything was wrong with him. It just felt like he had a very particular kink and I was making it happen", "What's to say he wouldn't work 2 jobs anyway. I did the same when I was in college because if I didn't, I would have way too much energy left to be able to sleep at the end of the day. Plus that money made it so I could do whatever I wanted in my spare time. \n\nIf this genuinely makes the sub happy, how is this unhealthy? Plus if she were to cut it off, he would just go to find someone else.. if he wouldn't be able to find someone else, maybe he will grow depressed or worse. The fact that he had a dom before her shows he will definitely go look for someone else.", "Being a Dom comes with the responsibility to make sure your sub is safe and healthy. Nothing wrong with letting him clean and pay your rent, but at the very least you should be checking in to make sure that he isn't neglecting his education just to work enough hours to pay your bills, because at that point you are supporting something that is causing real harm, not just a kink."]}
