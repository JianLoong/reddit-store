If you keep things clean you are done fairly fast. Also whatever free time I did have, I had enough money to do whatever I wanted because of the two jobs. \n\nWhat he gets out of it is for him to know. Just cuz we don't understand doesn't mean it's necessarily unhealthy. Laying on his couch feeling depressed not being able to do what makes him happy sounds more unhealthy to me. Maybe the sub is already in therapy to try and deal with whatever struggles they face and this is their coping mechanism currently keeping them stable.\n\nOP is being safe, someone else close by knows when he is in her house and they seem to have laid down their grounds quite clearly. Tho they should have a contract in place. But other than that, it seems okay.", ">bordering on self harm\n\nI really don't think that's an accurate description of the situation.\n\nHe's paying a young lady for access to her dirty laundry.

I mean you consent to basically being his boss and getting paid, you just did not initiate. He is your servant by your consent. So there is some responsibility on your shoulders for his well-being, like it or not. \nI mean if you want a perspective and you trust that person to have his best interest at heart, too, talk again to his dominatrix? (If she is dependend on him paying her, I would however not really trust her to make a fair assessment). \n\nPersonally, I would kinda draw the line at him paying (to be fair, i wouldnt let him clean either because that is just not how I swing) and maybe just talk to him that you fear he his putting his well-being at risk? I mean i get that this is benefical and someine else paying your rent is awesome, but I think you kinda enable self-destructive behaviour. \nAlso, how is the whole consent? Can he say no? Can he always drop out? Do you order him around? Etc. Etc. \nMaybe you should ask in a BDSM-Sub what they think of that whole thing, including him having a second job.

He trying to woo you?", "how is it strange to as a young college student, take an offer for your entire rent to be paid and your apartment cleaned? \n\nhe clearly is doing this because it\u2019s a fetish of his but there\u2019s no reason why op would say no when that\u2019s an amazing deal", "Yeah I\u2019m definitely keep it more low key from now on", "If someone is doing something that's actively harmful to themselves, you can just not help them do it.

It just felt like he had a very particular kink and I was making it happen", "What's to say he wouldn't work 2 jobs anyway. I did the same when I was in college because if I didn't, I would have way too much energy left to be able to sleep at the end of the day. Plus that money made it so I could do whatever I wanted in my spare time. \n\nIf this genuinely makes the sub happy, how is this unhealthy? Plus if she were to cut it off, he would just go to find someone else.. if he wouldn't be able to find someone else, maybe he will grow depressed or worse. The fact that he had a dom before her shows he will definitely go look for someone else.", "Being a Dom comes with the responsibility to make sure your sub is safe and healthy. Nothing wrong with letting him clean and pay your rent, but at the very least you should be checking in to make sure that he isn't neglecting his education just to work enough hours to pay your bills, because at that point you are supporting something that is causing real harm, not just a kink.", "INFO:  OP are you like super model hot?\n\nHow can I get myself a rent/cleaning pig?", "I'm so confused with this.. what is this guy gaining from cleaning your place AND paying your rent?

NTA but very strange arrangement.  I'd actually be anxious to have him in my home.  What does he really want?", "NTA, kinda. Doesn't seem like he's being coerced, but I find any kind of findom type thing to be at least mildly predatory.", "Generally things that seem too good to be true are.

Y'all need to get it in your heads that nontraditional sexual desires don't make someone a murderer.", "I'd say NTA for the arrangement in general, but that having him come over when you're friends were there is not appropriate. \n\n\nI'm not going to speculate on exactly what he's getting out of this arrangement but whatever it is your friends didn't give informed and advanced consent for being involved in / viewing this.\n\n\n\nYou and this guy also need some written ground rules for this sort of thing, discussed in a space where he does not feel beholden to you. Unless he had agreed in advance that he was willing / wanting to do this around other people (who must be people who have also given informed advanced consent) then you've put him in a potentially difficult position.\n\n\nI can understand that you don't see how he's benefiting from this and that probably means that you don't see this as being something that has a sexual component, but it very likely does. That means that you have to approach it on that basis.", "You didn't ask for it, but you DID agree to it, which means you essentially have a responsibility as his dom now. I still think you're NTA, but it's just something to keep in mind in the future, that by agreeing to become someone's dom, you do take on an increased amount of responsibility toward that person. So regular check-ins on how he's doing, making sure he has a way to say \"no\" if circumstances change for him and doesn't feel unconsciously pressured to continue, that sort of thing. Perhaps a safeword-- even though consensual non-consent is not part of the arrangement so \"no\" would suffice, it can still provide a sense of security that \"no\" is actually an option and make it clearer by establishing a safeword.", "It's a kink thing for him. As such, everything will work much better if you keep the arrangement private, even though it's nonsexual.

That's clearly not normal behavior, and you're enabling it. By letting him pay you are continuing to invite it, you just like the rewards so you're acting like you're not involved at all.

You could just as easily have told him he can clean for free, you'd still be getting a good deal even though it's creepy.\n\nYou plainly know you are taking advantage of him in a completely one sided situation and he's taking an extra job on to cover your rent. HOnestly it's gross. Doesn't matter how into it he is. Frankly it seems like his situation is problematic and a very unhealthy addiction for him and you're happy to take advantage.", "NTA I mean, you might be taking advantage if you\u2019re intentionally letting your place get trashed but \u2026 he approached you and it\u2019s his thing going on, the arrangement he wanted. If he\u2019s happy with it, then that\u2019s that.", "Uh\u2026 don\u2019t rlly know how to begin. So ima just say NTA I guess and leave it at that", "NTA but make sure he can sustain it. Dont have him bankrupt hinself obv. Id love to ask details on the whole arrangement itself purely out of curiosity but this is not the place lol.", "Nta, Sweetie you gotta learn how to keep your mouth shut. Everybody doesn't need to know everything.", "There are a few people in this world who enjoy that kind of thing. It's okay to be in a consensual relationship with them. It would be different if you were exploiting him somehow but you're not.", "NTA - don't kinkshame your pet cleaner.", "lol you\u2019re hilarious. youre doing great\ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd23", "NTA. He would probably be pissed people were trying to interfere with his plug, tbh", "Can I get his number?", "YTA duh!!! You're taking advantage of this guy. You only agreed to it because he does everything, and you do nothing while you get all the benefits.  LoL", "NTA, but I can see why your friends tell you you\u2019re wrong.\n\nPersonally I could never do it because although he wants it, I would feel like I was taking advantage.", "Look up fin dom, he is doing this because he wants to.", "That's it, shed all responsibility, blame the guy, and reap all the rewards! Feminism all the way!!! Who cares if the guy was abused into thinking he's a slave to females by some \"dominatrix\"? Keep abusing him!!! No accountability or responsibility on your part!!!", "I actually feel like OP was a bit of an AH for revealing the details of the arrangement to outsiders", "OP mentioned in another comment that the guy had consented beforehand to people knowing about it, so I did take that into account. But you're right to point it out-- it is a good idea to double-check and make sure that that consent is *enthusiastic* consent, because a first-time dom might not necessarily be able to read \"reluctantly says yes\" versus \"agrees wholeheartedly.\" And it's always good to check in the moment, \"Are you still okay with people knowing about this now that it's an imminent decision?\" rather than \"are you hypothetically okay about this in the future\" sort of a thing."]}
