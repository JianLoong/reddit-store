{"id": 31194, "submission_id": "17xz0vp", "title": "AITA for not celebrating my husband\u2019s birthday after our wedding?", "selftext": "I (29F) just got married to my husband (now 32M) one week ago. We had an outdoor destination wedding and drove cross-country to our location, 2.5 days each way. We had a great weekend and wedding and I felt like we had a wonderful time to look back on. He picked up COVID either from the wedding or on the drive back so by the time we were home, he was feeling very poorly. We have been house-bound with recommended quarantines and he has been in bed except for a few hours since we\u2019ve returned on Wednesday. Today is his 32nd birthday. Yesterday, I had picked up a card for him at the shop when I was getting medication and supplies for homemade chicken soup. I wrote a note about how I loved our wedding and his first birthday as a husband.  This morning, he slept late and I gave him the card when he first woke up. Other than the card, truthfully, I neglected birthday planning with everything involved with the wedding, returning home, and caring for him. \nOur \u201cplan\u201d was to order pizza and watch a movie at home that evening so I busied myself with laundry and house chores. He was in and out of sleep through the day. Around 6pm, I attempted to wake him to see if he was hungry and wanted food and he told me \u201cno.\u201d At 7:15, he woke up and was angry/hurt that I had not cooked dinner, ordered food, or planned an evening that acknowledged \u201chis day\u201d as he calls it. To his credit, he states he didn\u2019t expect anything fancy. In his words, he did want his partner to acknowledge his birthday because in his mind a birthday should be the \u201cmost important day of a partner\u2019s life\u201d since without that day, you wouldn\u2019t have a partner. For context, I come from a family where we were lucky to have our parents remember our birthday at all once we turned 10. \nWhen he came to me upset, I tried to listen and tell him I\u2019m sorry but because of all we had been doing, I didn\u2019t have a \u201cplan.\u201d It\u2019s been a consistent argument for the last few hours now and I know I\u2019m wrong for not giving him proper acknowledgment, but I\u2019m also questioning if this is an inappropriate reaction on his part. I have thrown him parties (including a surprise party) in the past but just didn\u2019t this year with how busy we were. AITA?\n\nEDIT for context - The wedding and location was his idea. We had been together long enough that I wanted to go to the courthouse, but he wanted a wedding and said he would help with planning. I ended up doing 99% of it. I also did get him a gift. One of his wedding gifts was expensive and something he wanted for a long time, so for his birthday I arranged to have it preserved and framed. Meaning he did get more than a card for his birthday.", "created_utc": 1700283940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xz0vp/aita_for_not_celebrating_my_husbands_birthday/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As for everything else, you woke him up to ask if he wanted food. He's sick, so that looks like timing (even if that's when he usually eats) based on your needs/wants and not him. It might not have been like that at all, but it's easy to see why he'd think that way. Just like not buying a cake when you got chicken soup ingredients and not grabbing a weird token to give him as a present and saying you \"want to go shopping for something really special, but was worried about him and didn't want to stay away that long right now.\"\n\nSee the differences, OP?

When we\u2019ve had small celebrations in the past with the two of us he has been happy. The only time a birthday has been neglected was 5+ years ago when I purposefully didn\u2019t celebrate because of some loyalty issues he was having. I don\u2019t know if this situation brought up old feelings, if feeling sick changed things, or if I was meant to show out for his first birthday as a husband. I\u2019m not totally sure.

I know that because of your upbringing, it's not super important to you, but HE thinks birthdays are important. The converse of what he said is that YOUR birthday is the most important day of his life. Does he make you feel special, appreciated, and cared for?\n\nBased on the fact that he insisted on the wedding and travel and then abandoned all responsibility to you, I'm guessing the answer is no.\n\nSo the question is, do you want to spend the rest of your life doing 99% of the emotional labour, just like you did 99% of the wedding planning?\n\nTo (hopefully) catastrophise a bit:\nCan you foresee organising both your lives and being made to feel small if you don't compensate well enough for his lack of contribution and initiative?

Is there anything he does that makes you feel loved and supported?) without that ever being reciprocated?\n\nIf any of that feels true or possible, please value yourself more.

The key phrase in here was about how he comes from a birthday family and you don't. That's why you're not seeing eye to eye on this. He's used to a big deal and just felt forgotten and disappointed, it's human. Especially when you're already sick and disoriented, it's easy to be emotional about little things. You're not used to a big deal and are overwhelmed, it's also human for you to not do a ton for this birthday. Idk, I think you both just need to work on understanding each other better.", "INFO: if you have been together so long,what has happened for birthdays past?

I can understand him being disappointed that he didn't get to do more for his birthday and then being extra upset because he's sick and people are often more emotional when they are sick cuz they're dealing with all their symptoms so have less bandwidth to regulate their emotions.

But you also have a much lower expectation for birthdays (for very sad reasons, btw) and clearly he was expecting something bigger. He\u2019s sick, probably upset he\u2019s sick both so soon after the wedding and on his bday, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s cranky. Clearly communicate your expectations for birthdays going forward and let it go \ud83d\udc95\n\nThat said, think about the relationship overall. How well do you communicate? How often do you fight? How can you improve? All things worth considering! Best of luck, and congrats on the wedding!", "Homes you married him. Shouldn't you know what his expectation of birthday's are?\n\nYTA.", "Because she has said herself she does not see birthdays as important? For a sad reason, yes, but OP does not want her birthday to be a huge spectacle. He celebrates the way SHE wants.", "Oh, poor baby\u2026He might not be a narcissist, but certainly behaved like one. OP got him a card, made a soup, cared enough in the circumstances they were in. He is not 5 years old but he certainly acted like was. OP, sounds like a warning sign. Did he behave in the past like this? Sulking when something didn\u2019t go up to his expectations?", "Why are you putting yourself down and why do you say you didn't properly acknowledge his birthday.  You've given him a card and have a present organised.  What else are you supposed to do. Run round waving flags or something.  It's sounds like within days of getting hitched you've found out you married an adult child!!", "Your assumptions are inane", "He\u2019s sick with COVId. She woke him up - he needed sleep, and would have been groggy.", "So basically same level.  \n\nHe\u2019s an adult with friends right?  I feel like only child thing might explain if he was younger but has he not paid attention to other people\u2019s bdays and how often it\u2019s chill", "Honestly I may be in the minority but reading some of your responses I really think you're setting yourself up to be the downtrodden wife. Your husband chose the wedding venue so didn't take into account your wishes. You got him a card and pressie but that wasn't good enough according to him. You tried to wake him to give him something to eat. He goes back to sleep and an hour later moans about not having anything to eat. Do you see how all that sounds and you mention a loyalty issue so presumably he was unfaithful in some way.", "NTA. He sounds extremely selfish.", "\u201cGot him a card\u201d isn\u2019t some grand gesture, she was already in the store and just grabbed one walking by. It\u2019s one step up from the bare minimum of saying \u201chappy bday\u201d", "Narcissist is not a synonym for selfish.", "How? He said he didn't want food, and got upset when there wasn't food. Makes sense that when he did want food, he wanted fresh food. My assumptions are probably correct and he is the one in the wrong. :)", "I thought this. He has done the bare minimum for her birthdays. She seems so negative about herself.", "Man-flu.  It\u2019s a thing.  Sucks.  I\u2019m so grateful my hubby is never sick (really!  And he is 72!).  He had a deer hit him while on the freeway on his motorcycle (he didn\u2019t hit the deer, he was in his lane \ud83e\udd23) and had prostate cancer.  But never has a headache, fever etc.  It\u2019s crazy.  \nNTA. If you had gone all out, he wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it anyway.  Cake? Not if you can\u2019t taste stuff.  You got something framed and a card and you were going to order dinner but he wasn\u2019t even hungry ( cuz he is sick!).    Hopefully he gets over his grumpy self when he starts to feel better.", "Does his 'loyalty' mean he cheated on you in the past? Just from reading your comments and your post, it sounds like he is spoiled and immature. Circumstances were against you both. He slept most of the day & you looked after him well. Homemade soup, present, card, clean house etc & you did all the wedding planning too, to please him. NTA", "I also never get sick. My Gf had walking pneumonia and Covid back to back last month and now I think she has bronchitis. So I get to take care of her because I don\u2019t catch a thing. Love it! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Copied from another comment: While he has never planned a big party or anything with my family, he does always have a gift and some treat to acknowledge the day. My birthday last year he gave me a cake and small gift with the two of us at home", "So, about the same effort he got this year. NTA. Did COVID eat his brain or something?", "Fuck, he\u2019s a narcissist\u2026.i was hoping that person was wrong that said that, but damn. That\u2019s classic narcissistic personality behavior. Expecting more than given is super toxic. I hope he snaps out of this. Sounds like you may not recognize signs. There\u2019s substantial reading material, and even you tube videos. I really hope we\u2019re wrong here\u2026."]}
