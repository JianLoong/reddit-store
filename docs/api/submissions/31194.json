{"id": 31194, "submission_id": "17xz0vp", "title": "AITA for not celebrating my husband\u2019s birthday after our wedding?", "selftext": "I (29F) just got married to my husband (now 32M) one week ago. We had an outdoor destination wedding and drove cross-country to our location, 2.5 days each way. We had a great weekend and wedding and I felt like we had a wonderful time to look back on. He picked up COVID either from the wedding or on the drive back so by the time we were home, he was feeling very poorly. We have been house-bound with recommended quarantines and he has been in bed except for a few hours since we\u2019ve returned on Wednesday. Today is his 32nd birthday. Yesterday, I had picked up a card for him at the shop when I was getting medication and supplies for homemade chicken soup. I wrote a note about how I loved our wedding and his first birthday as a husband.  This morning, he slept late and I gave him the card when he first woke up. Other than the card, truthfully, I neglected birthday planning with everything involved with the wedding, returning home, and caring for him. \nOur \u201cplan\u201d was to order pizza and watch a movie at home that evening so I busied myself with laundry and house chores. He was in and out of sleep through the day. Around 6pm, I attempted to wake him to see if he was hungry and wanted food and he told me \u201cno.\u201d At 7:15, he woke up and was angry/hurt that I had not cooked dinner, ordered food, or planned an evening that acknowledged \u201chis day\u201d as he calls it. To his credit, he states he didn\u2019t expect anything fancy. In his words, he did want his partner to acknowledge his birthday because in his mind a birthday should be the \u201cmost important day of a partner\u2019s life\u201d since without that day, you wouldn\u2019t have a partner. For context, I come from a family where we were lucky to have our parents remember our birthday at all once we turned 10. \nWhen he came to me upset, I tried to listen and tell him I\u2019m sorry but because of all we had been doing, I didn\u2019t have a \u201cplan.\u201d It\u2019s been a consistent argument for the last few hours now and I know I\u2019m wrong for not giving him proper acknowledgment, but I\u2019m also questioning if this is an inappropriate reaction on his part. I have thrown him parties (including a surprise party) in the past but just didn\u2019t this year with how busy we were. AITA?\n\nEDIT for context - The wedding and location was his idea. We had been together long enough that I wanted to go to the courthouse, but he wanted a wedding and said he would help with planning. I ended up doing 99% of it. I also did get him a gift. One of his wedding gifts was expensive and something he wanted for a long time, so for his birthday I arranged to have it preserved and framed. Meaning he did get more than a card for his birthday.", "created_utc": 1700283940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xz0vp/aita_for_not_celebrating_my_husbands_birthday/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry I dropped the ball this time but you slept the day away and I didn't think you'd be up to celebrating. Let's plan something when you're feeling much better to go out to eat.\"\n\nAt least you did get him a card", "I'm going with NTA. I'm sorry, but you did acknowledge his birthday. What is a birthday card, if not acknowledgment? You spent the day taking care of him and didn't order the food because he said he wasn't hungry. Did he want to wake up to cold food? Because I'm sorry, but 1 hour later ( which is how long he slept for after you asked him), that pizza was going to be cold. You aren't a mind reader or fortune teller to know when he was going to wake up.", "ESH but gently. He\u2019s a bit overly dramatic  about his birthday. You could have asked earlier \u201cI know you\u2019re not feeling well, how about making you chicken soup tonight and properly celebrating when you feel better. \u201c\n\nC\u2019est le ton qui fait la musique.", "NTA you tried to get him to earn it\u2019s his own fault he refused", "NTA. You made homemade chicken soup when he was sick.", "NAH I think. The day wasn\u2019t really important to you as so much else has overshadowed it; the day was important to him and he\u2019s hurt that you let it be overshadowed. This is one of those \u201cit is important to me because it\u2019s important to you\u201d moments in marriage.\n\nI do think his reaction seems over the top, especially as you say the argument had/has continued for hours; however, that usually happens when the aggrieved partner feels like they\u2019re not actually being understood.", "NTA from the context you\u2019ve given. What was he expecting? If his birthdays are so important to him you guys should\u2019ve had your wedding not so close to it. You may have married a narcissist, they always ruin big days such as weddings and birthdays. Sorry but a normal person who wasn\u2019t so self absorbed would\u2019ve told you that his birthday present this year was getting married to you.", "Give him the card and note again - and tell him you planned to order delivery of anything he wanted to eat when he got hungry and that you're sorry you woke him up instead of wait until he woke himself. As for everything else, you woke him up to ask if he wanted food. He's sick, so that looks like timing (even if that's when he usually eats) based on your needs/wants and not him. It might not have been like that at all, but it's easy to see why he'd think that way. Just like not buying a cake when you got chicken soup ingredients and not grabbing a weird token to give him as a present and saying you \"want to go shopping for something really special, but was worried about him and didn't want to stay away that long right now.\"\n\nSee the differences, OP? It both is and isn't you --- and it's easy to fix. Treat your new husband like he's the most valuable thing in the world instead of letting yourself come across as disinterested.", "You were so busy with the wedding that you forgot about your husband?  \n\nThat says a lot.  YTA.", "Did you get him a box of tissues?  An estimated 137 million people were born in 1991, avg. 377k per day, sothe stats do not support his claim on that day.  Works out to about 1/4 of a second. Next year though, for the sake of your marriage, if you can still put up with him, you might want to do a little more. \ud83d\ude42", "BS story. The antithesis of dramatic women who want and expect the world to stop because it's their birthday.", "ESH. He\u2019s sick, feels like crap, and would feel bad whether or not you threw him the birthday celebration of the century or not. That said, you basically said the wedding was number one (and you as the bride) and your family isn\u2019t into birthdays (again, all about you). So, how about a do-over? When he\u2019s feeling better surprise him with a nice birthday evening, and remember henceforth that he values his birthday, plan ahead, and make him feel like a king.

That said, I\u2019m surprised that you didn\u2019t know by now how important birthdays are to him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA wouldn't it be lots better to have a celebration of sorts when he's feeling better? We've done that many times before.\n\nOnce my friend had her birthday during an incredible winter storm (North Cape) and none of us could show up cus roads were closed and it was dangerous to drive. We then decided to celebrate a bit later when the storm cleared and my friend had a super duper birthday celebration. I even baked her a cake from scratch! (A allergen friendly rainbow cheesecake:D) As well as everyone had presents ready from before.", "NAH\n\nYou got him a card, made him homemade soup, and tried to acknowledge the day as best you could. But you admit you\u2019ve been conditioned to have low expectations for bdays.\n\nHe\u2019s sick, upset, and was hoping for something bigger to cheer him up.\n\nChalk this up to newlywed hiccups and miscommunication and carry on. Now that you know his bday matters to him, you know to put in that lil extra oomph next year.", "NTA, he's sick and feeling sorry for himself, when my husband is sick everyone will suffer if I baby him too much lol - he'll get over it.", "I agree with you ofc she is not the asshole", "You\u2019re right in the message is all about intention and how things are said. This is a good perspective because I\u2019m definitely not all in the right here", "I think that is a really good point and something to think about. Even if I didn\u2019t realize at the time, he was likely feeling misunderstood and that\u2019s why the fight continued", "Oh for heaven\u2019s sake. Reddit needs to stop armchair diagnosing everyone with narcissism. The guy has COVID, feels crappy, and is disappointed his expectations for his bday weren\u2019t met. That doesn\u2019t make him a narcissist \ud83d\ude44", "I don\u2019t want to believe he\u2019s a narcissist (tale as old as time, right) but he is an only child so I\u2019m wondering if that has something to do with it. It doesn\u2019t seem to have to do with gifts because he seemed to like my gift - preserving and framing a gift he wanted for a long time that I got for him on our wedding. I\u2019m just not sure where it\u2019s coming from except maybe sickness/irritation/frustration?", "I can definitely understand this perspective and in retrospect, should have picked up a cake or something for him. His parents had sent a large birthday cupcake that I got candles for, but to your point, showing more interest would likely be the most beneficial. In my family you got either a present, or some kind of treat. I had gotten him a present that he was aware of already, so it didn\u2019t cross my mind unfortunately.", "This has to be a joke. They said the plan was to get pizza and stay home. He has covid for gods sake. He rejected having dinner, and then got pissy when she listened. NTA.", "I should have clarified that I didn\u2019t \u201cforget\u201d about him. I did get him a fairly expensive gift for our wedding that he had been wanting for a while and the follow-up birthday gift was getting said wedding gift preserved and framed for him. I was more concerned about him getting sleep today but should have woke him for our original plan.", "I think this is route to go, honestly. I never expect to be a queen and am the polar opposite of a \u201clook at me\u201d girl. The wedding was thrown because he wanted it (I wanted to go the court house) and so with that, driving home, COVID, and the gift I had already gotten him I thought that would be sufficient. But, we learn each day we\u2019re on this Earth. And to your point, I know now 100% how much he values his birthday. A do-over will be in the works for sure", "Tbf I was surprised by his reaction. When we\u2019ve had small celebrations in the past with the two of us he has been happy. The only time a birthday has been neglected was 5+ years ago when I purposefully didn\u2019t celebrate because of some loyalty issues he was having. I don\u2019t know if this situation brought up old feelings, if feeling sick changed things, or if I was meant to show out for his first birthday as a husband. I\u2019m not totally sure. But this is the first time he\u2019s mentioned the \u201cmost important day of the partner\u2019s life\u201d thing to me", "His reaction seems over the top.  INFO:  What did you do for his previous birthdays?", "And he probably would have fallen asleep during the movie.", "It is possible that he attached extra meaning to this specific occasion because it\u2019s his first birthday as your husband. But as others have pointed out, it could also be partly due to his being unwell. I do have a question for you, however. Does he fuss over your birthday? I know you\u2019re not really a birthday person, but if he is one, I hope he does try to go to extra lengths to celebrate you.", "He has covid and he\u2019s a man. Of course he\u2019s over the top. Best way to break in a marriage is to get the worst behind you right off the bat.", "For previous birthdays I have baked him cakes (from a box, NOT a baker here), arranged a surprise party, made dinner reservations for us and his parents, and the routine smaller celebrations. The one time I did not throw a celebration was the year we went through a hard time due to his loyalty. That was a long time ago and this is the first year since then that nothing \u201csignificant\u201d has been planned", "While he has never planned a big party or anything with my family, he does always have a gift and some treat to acknowledge the day. My birthday last year he gave me a cake and small gift with the two of us at home", "yeah this", "And what does he do for your birthdays?"]}
