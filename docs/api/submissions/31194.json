{"id": 31194, "submission_id": "17xz0vp", "title": "AITA for not celebrating my husband\u2019s birthday after our wedding?", "selftext": "I (29F) just got married to my husband (now 32M) one week ago. We had an outdoor destination wedding and drove cross-country to our location, 2.5 days each way. We had a great weekend and wedding and I felt like we had a wonderful time to look back on. He picked up COVID either from the wedding or on the drive back so by the time we were home, he was feeling very poorly. We have been house-bound with recommended quarantines and he has been in bed except for a few hours since we\u2019ve returned on Wednesday. Today is his 32nd birthday. Yesterday, I had picked up a card for him at the shop when I was getting medication and supplies for homemade chicken soup. I wrote a note about how I loved our wedding and his first birthday as a husband.  This morning, he slept late and I gave him the card when he first woke up. Other than the card, truthfully, I neglected birthday planning with everything involved with the wedding, returning home, and caring for him. \nOur \u201cplan\u201d was to order pizza and watch a movie at home that evening so I busied myself with laundry and house chores. He was in and out of sleep through the day. Around 6pm, I attempted to wake him to see if he was hungry and wanted food and he told me \u201cno.\u201d At 7:15, he woke up and was angry/hurt that I had not cooked dinner, ordered food, or planned an evening that acknowledged \u201chis day\u201d as he calls it. To his credit, he states he didn\u2019t expect anything fancy. In his words, he did want his partner to acknowledge his birthday because in his mind a birthday should be the \u201cmost important day of a partner\u2019s life\u201d since without that day, you wouldn\u2019t have a partner. For context, I come from a family where we were lucky to have our parents remember our birthday at all once we turned 10. \nWhen he came to me upset, I tried to listen and tell him I\u2019m sorry but because of all we had been doing, I didn\u2019t have a \u201cplan.\u201d It\u2019s been a consistent argument for the last few hours now and I know I\u2019m wrong for not giving him proper acknowledgment, but I\u2019m also questioning if this is an inappropriate reaction on his part. I have thrown him parties (including a surprise party) in the past but just didn\u2019t this year with how busy we were. AITA?\n\nEDIT for context - The wedding and location was his idea. We had been together long enough that I wanted to go to the courthouse, but he wanted a wedding and said he would help with planning. I ended up doing 99% of it. I also did get him a gift. One of his wedding gifts from me was expensive and something he wanted for a long time, so for his birthday I arranged to have it preserved and framed. Meaning he did get more than a card for his birthday.", "created_utc": 1700283940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xz0vp/aita_for_not_celebrating_my_husbands_birthday/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As for everything else, you woke him up to ask if he wanted food. He's sick, so that looks like timing (even if that's when he usually eats) based on your needs/wants and not him. It might not have been like that at all, but it's easy to see why he'd think that way. Just like not buying a cake when you got chicken soup ingredients and not grabbing a weird token to give him as a present and saying you \"want to go shopping for something really special, but was worried about him and didn't want to stay away that long right now.\"\n\nSee the differences, OP?

His parents had sent a large birthday cupcake that I got candles for, but to your point, showing more interest would likely be the most beneficial.

When we\u2019ve had small celebrations in the past with the two of us he has been happy. The only time a birthday has been neglected was 5+ years ago when I purposefully didn\u2019t celebrate because of some loyalty issues he was having. I don\u2019t know if this situation brought up old feelings, if feeling sick changed things, or if I was meant to show out for his first birthday as a husband. I\u2019m not totally sure.

I know that because of your upbringing, it's not super important to you, but HE thinks birthdays are important. The converse of what he said is that YOUR birthday is the most important day of his life. Does he make you feel special, appreciated, and cared for?\n\nBased on the fact that he insisted on the wedding and travel and then abandoned all responsibility to you, I'm guessing the answer is no.\n\nSo the question is, do you want to spend the rest of your life doing 99% of the emotional labour, just like you did 99% of the wedding planning?\n\nTo (hopefully) catastrophise a bit:\nCan you foresee organising both your lives and being made to feel small if you don't compensate well enough for his lack of contribution and initiative? Not just planning your lives, but bending over backwards to make him feel appreciated (and what's to appreciate? Is there anything he does that makes you feel loved and supported?) without that ever being reciprocated?\n\nIf any of that feels true or possible, please value yourself more.

The key phrase in here was about how he comes from a birthday family and you don't. That's why you're not seeing eye to eye on this. He's used to a big deal and just felt forgotten and disappointed, it's human. Especially when you're already sick and disoriented, it's easy to be emotional about little things. You're not used to a big deal and are overwhelmed, it's also human for you to not do a ton for this birthday. Idk, I think you both just need to work on understanding each other better.", "INFO: if you have been together so long,what has happened for birthdays past?

That's kind of ridiculous, ngl. I'd be super upset if I were you about him saying that. \n\nHopefully he's not normally a jerk like that. I can understand him being disappointed that he didn't get to do more for his birthday and then being extra upset because he's sick and people are often more emotional when they are sick cuz they're dealing with all their symptoms so have less bandwidth to regulate their emotions.

He\u2019s sick, probably upset he\u2019s sick both so soon after the wedding and on his bday, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s cranky.

You tried to wake him to give him something to eat. He goes back to sleep and an hour later moans about not having anything to eat.

He never celebrated his birthday growing up and still doesn\u2019t. I got bare minimum acknowledgment from him on my birthday and he couldn\u2019t fathom why I was so upset by his attitude towards it. I bet you gave him a card and treated it just like any other day to you. Also I\u2019m a bit confused about his birthday gift.

Did you even get him a little cake or anything to actually celebrate the day when he woke up?", "NTA \nYou took care of him while he was I'll, including sleeping the majotlrity of his birthday.

Seems his expectations are a bit over the top.", "NTA; he was too sick to go out anyway, and you wrote him a sweet card and had a plan for dinner in. He turned down the dinner.

My husband is someone with the birthday a few days before Christmas, so I do a lot because his celebrations growing up were always lost in the season, I go big! 1 year, he was sick, so I made him homemade soup and a card. His gift was new pajama pants to lounge in while being ill. He was still excited and thanked me for making him feel loved on his day. \n\nBeing disappointed in your partner for not going above and beyond after such a big event while he is sick and sleeping is crazy. Also, you just gave him an expensive gift... after the wedding expenses. And then went above giving and had it preserved.

You still got a card and acknowledged the day. You did great. \n\nMy husband and I are just about your same ages, together for around 10 years, and honestly your husband needs to grow up. Over the years there have been many times when a birthday happened to fall in the middle of a hectic time \u2014 one of us was sick or had surgery, fam member sick, travel, etc. we always make an effort, and sometimes it\u2019s a small effort depending on the circumstances. On birthdays when we had the time, we did big celebrations. But the small efforts count too.", "What would have been good for him and I always tell people this when they are sick even with COVID, Chinese soups like hot and sour or wonton soup.   I always got that when I felt sick with a cold or flu.  A dish with it whatever his favorite is would have been a nice birthday surprise, but you had a lot going on and he was sick.  Tell him that.  Just remember that birthdays are important. It's sad that your parents did not think so.", "Little bit of AH. He wanted to feel special on his birthday even though he was ill. While birthdays may not be a big deal in your family,  surely you've been with him long enough  to know how he feels.  You could have had a present and treat ready for when he was feeling up to it. Instead,  you let other important things overshadow his day (illness,  wedding).

But, as one had commented, he was trying to feel better and probably felt a bit guilty for getting sick during the honeymoon and his birthday.\n\nAlso, please don't combine your wedding gift with that of your hubby's in the future. That's like buying one gift for a person born on/around Christmas day. I know you mentioned that it's expensive, but he may think that's is going to be like that in years to come and that could put a burr in the relationship.\n\nAs in all advice go, communication is the key.\n \nApoligize again, think up of a plan, and ask him that once he's back in good health, what he would like for his birthday outing. If money is an issue, find the nearest city's/town's activities or festivals and see what they have to offer.

And then, what, changed his mind again?", "If it makes you feel better, in the beginning of our marriage, my wife and I had an argument or two about birthdays.
