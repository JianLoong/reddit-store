We have lost contact and gotten in contact again off and on over the years. Jane helped me get away from my abusive ex husband and I will forever be greatful for that. \nOur kids have been the best of friends their whole life and grew up together since they were babies (the oldest ones are both 9 now) and the oldest ones are who the story is about. \nMy oldest child has a health condition that requires her to be on a low sodium diet until we get the rest of her test results and see if this will fix the issue or if we need to do more testing to find out what\u2019s causing it. \nSo this past year Jane\u2019s oldest hasn\u2019t been the nicest to my oldest off and on thru the school year, saying mean things to her and doing mean things to my oldest\u2019s friends. I have brought it up to Jane so many times and she always says \u201cmy child would never do it\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s crying so she\u2019s telling me the truth\u201d. To me that sounds like she\u2019s telling me my child is lying. My oldest has been thru a lot this past year with hospital stays surgery and so many doctor visits and therapy literally has been thru hell this past year. \nI am getting married in 2024 and Jane is suppose to be my maid of honor. Why I\u2019m wondering if I would be the ah to kick Jane out of the wedding and not even invite her family as guests goes as such:\nMy oldest came home this past week completely distraught and when I was finally able to calm her down to find out what happened she told me this:\n\u201cI was at lunch sitting next to (Jane\u2019s oldest) and they asked why I don\u2019t eat the school lunch. I said cause I\u2019m on a diet. They said well I\u2019m on a diet for the rest of my life. (I\u2019ve been told Jane calls her oldest cubby idk if that\u2019s true) I said I\u2019m on a low sodium diet. And then they looked at me and said the one thing I hate about (my childs name) is that they think they\u2019re on a diet.\u201d I was livid! Someone who is suppose to be her friend goes and says this to the point where my child is completely having a breakdown about it sorry I\u2019m not ok! I don\u2019t tolerate bullying in anyway weather it\u2019s someone else\u2019s kids or my own. I know my children are not perfect angels and I\u2019ll be the first to admit it but this was to far. \nSo would I be the AH to kick Jane and her family out of our wedding not even as a guest to protect my child from their bully? \n\nUpdate: I did contact the school and the principal as well as my child\u2019s teacher are looking into the situation and have spoken with both kids to figure this out cause I explained how Jane responded to me in the past about bring up things in the past (note: I\u2019m not the only \u201cfriend\u201d she says this too when confronted about one of her kids bullying or picking on a kid it\u2019s a consistent thing)", "created_utc": 1677941090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i0tu6/wibta_for_kicking_my_long_time_friend_out_of_my/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But she\u2019s doing her child a disservice by turning a blind eye to her child\u2019s faults. She\u2019s putting her own child\u2019s words over everyone else\u2019s, including yours. So you can put your child first too. Never let a bully stay around your child. If you stay friends with Jane and keep them around your child, it\u2019s going to show her that you don\u2019t care about her health and well being. \n\nIt\u2019s Jane\u2019s choice not to listen and have her own child understand that they\u2019re bullying and get them help. She\u2019ll be the one burning bridges here, not you. Hold fast to your priorities. \n\nIt\u2019s even a good teaching moment for your child to learn that even if some friendships are long lasting or short, if they\u2019re not respecting your boundaries and making them uncomfortable they\u2019re allowed to cut ties and they have to prioritize themselves. \nGood friends are ones that stick up for you and hold you to what\u2019s right, point out your mistakes so that you can grow from them, recognize when they\u2019re wrong and apologize. These are all good lessons she needs to learn and know for her own future to build good friendships and relationships of her own. \nWhat kind of role model would you be if you stayed friends with someone who enables a bully?", "This is about helping children work through and handle difficult issues and friendships, especially going into puberty - your daughter dealing with surgery and illness and it\u2019s impact on her life and your friend\u2019s daughter dealing with body image/dieting. And also modeling how adult friends handle these things. Why make this about you and your wedding over a year out? This does kind of make YTA. \n\nHelp your daughter process her health fears and limitations. Don\u2019t make the other girl the scapegoat. Enlist your friend on a mom\u2019s effort to make sure we raise happy and healthy young women. Forget about the wedding - this is about your kids, health, happiness.", "Thank you!

I\u2019ve tried talking with my child about bullies and what not to tolerate but she\u2019s a lot like me, tries to be friends with everyone and only tries to help everyone. I have no backbone and it hurt me a lot growing up and I don\u2019t want that for my child", "thank you! I appreciate the feedback and it gives me some ideas moving forward.

My mum was friends with this woman who had a son my age, we went to the same school but different classes. One day, unprovoked and for absolutely no reason, he insulted me at school. I don't even remember what it was exactly, I think he called me a pig or generally implied that I was fat and gross. \n\nWhen my mum dragged me to their place to demand an apology, his mother, my mum's years-long bestie, said that he won't apologize. She actually doubled down saying what he said was true. My mum ended their 10 years long friendship right there and then, at their door and they never spoke again after that. She refused to be friends with someone who disrespects her child and allows their kid to be a bully. \n\nThat happened many years ago, we had many disagreements throughout the years, but that single action showed just how much my mum loves me and that no matter what, I will always be her priority and she won't let anyone mistreat me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're NTA. And whatever friendship was between you and Jane, your child should always come first.", "Setting boundaries aren't mean. It's actually protecting your child and yourself.

I set boundaries nicely, but firmly, all the time. Good luck! Your kiddo is counting on you.", "NTA. That said, you should avoid contact with this lady. Your child always comes first. You seem to understand this, but i do need to stress that it\u2019s time to strengthen that backbone of yours by scrubbing the word WELCOME off of your forehead.", "NTA. I've done this and I've sat my kids down and spoken to them about how they're feeling in their friendships when I've noticed things they seem not to. Zero tolerance for bullying and manipulation.", "NTA Kick her out for the mental health and safety of your kid, your kid is more important to you than your friend or her bully kid! and it should always be that way!", "1. Learn how to use paragraph breaks. You are not a child.\n\n2. NTA.

I\u2019ve known them as a parent and as a teacher, and they are infuriating.", "best answer! I feel like the communication in this situation is super lacking. \n\nMaybe OP should have a convo with friend and her daughter (without her own daughter there if her child is uncomfortable being in the room)- this is something that should be discussed before going rogue in my opinion \n\nCommunicate to your friend - \"hey if you can't see my side and have this be a learning opportunity for your child and mine, then maybe we need some space between our families and should evaluate our friendship.\" - talk it out! \n\nElementary and middle school is a age where education and discussion matters - kids don't understand diet culture, body neutrality, health, etc. It is up to you to either brush it off or create a environment where they can learn and grow. \n\nI see OPs comments about being worried her daughter may not be able to stand up to others/ is too kind. Kindness is good but maybe put your daughter in a girl power group or smthing similar to build confidence and learn more :-) they have learning initiatives like that for elementary and middle schoolers\n\nand of course - if your friend brushes you off, you can end the friendship or uninvite her from the wedding. but think about the long term solution, big picture past your wedding, and what you can do for your daughter as a sensitive age!", "It's understandable if you have been in an abusive relationship. Take care!", "I\u2019ve seen a sale at Costco. Each backbone comes with some brass balls. Good deal.", "Standing up for your child isn't mean even if it makes someone else uncomfortable.\n\nWouldn't letting your daughter continue to be bullied be a mean action?\n\nYou need to reframe how you look at these things.", "If it gets worse - go to the friend and ask her to punish her child - if she doesn't that's when you can cut off the friendship. I think an actual in-depth convo would be telling of whether or not the friendship is salvageable. \n\nIt doesn't sound like OP has talked to her friends daughter or Friend has talked to OPs daughter. I think either would really be enlightening"]}
