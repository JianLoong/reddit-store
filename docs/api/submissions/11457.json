We have lost contact and gotten in contact again off and on over the years. Jane helped me get away from my abusive ex husband and I will forever be greatful for that. \nOur kids have been the best of friends their whole life and grew up together since they were babies (the oldest ones are both 9 now) and the oldest ones are who the story is about. \nMy oldest child has a health condition that requires her to be on a low sodium diet until we get the rest of her test results and see if this will fix the issue or if we need to do more testing to find out what\u2019s causing it. \nSo this past year Jane\u2019s oldest hasn\u2019t been the nicest to my oldest off and on thru the school year, saying mean things to her and doing mean things to my oldest\u2019s friends. I have brought it up to Jane so many times and she always says \u201cmy child would never do it\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s crying so she\u2019s telling me the truth\u201d. To me that sounds like she\u2019s telling me my child is lying. My oldest has been thru a lot this past year with hospital stays surgery and so many doctor visits and therapy literally has been thru hell this past year. \nI am getting married in 2024 and Jane is suppose to be my maid of honor. Why I\u2019m wondering if I would be the ah to kick Jane out of the wedding and not even invite her family as guests goes as such:\nMy oldest came home this past week completely distraught and when I was finally able to calm her down to find out what happened she told me this:\n\u201cI was at lunch sitting next to (Jane\u2019s oldest) and they asked why I don\u2019t eat the school lunch.

I know my children are not perfect angels and I\u2019ll be the first to admit it but this was to far. \nSo would I be the AH to kick Jane and her family out of our wedding not even as a guest to protect my child from their bully? \n\nUpdate: I did contact the school and the principal as well as my child\u2019s teacher are looking into the situation and have spoken with both kids to figure this out cause I explained how Jane responded to me in the past about bring up things in the past (note: I\u2019m not the only \u201cfriend\u201d she says this too when confronted about one of her kids bullying or picking on a kid it\u2019s a consistent thing)", "created_utc": 1677941090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i0tu6/wibta_for_kicking_my_long_time_friend_out_of_my/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
