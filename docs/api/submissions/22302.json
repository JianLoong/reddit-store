I ask her what's wrong and she bursts into tears and I can't understand a thing she's saying. But I do make out my sisters name. I try comforting her to no avail. \n\nSo, I decide to call my sister and ask her if she knows anything or if anything happened. Then, my sister starts crying on the phone and I also can't understand anything she's saying. So, I go to my gf and after a lot of time trying to comfort her, she finally calms down and is able to speak. \n\nShe tells me that she (my gf) asked my sister whether she (my sister) thinks she (my gf) should get her nails done with red or blue. Apparently then my sister tells her blue is better but my gf gets them done red.\n\nBtw, my sister was getting slushies while my gf was getting her nails done so she didn't realise at first. My sister walks into the nail salon and as soon as she sees my gf has done a different color, she flips out and embarrasses my gf calling her names and saying \"If you aren't going to give a s*** about my opinion then don't ask for it in the first place\".\n\nAccording to my gf, my sister was about to throw a slushie at her so my gf decided to throw one at my sister first? And she did so the altercation intensified. After that they were kicked out by security and my gf drove home and left my sister there without a car. \n\nUpon hearing all this, I was astounded. I told her I don't know who's more immature her or my sister. She then asked me who I'm going to side with and I told her I'm going to remain neutral since she isn't any better than my sister was by throwing a slushie at her and making her walk home when it's very hot outside. My gf got furious and said some hurtful insults. \n\nMy sister wont answer my calls and is nowhere to be found (shes not at her apartment but might be at a friends house). \nI feel bad now and maybe I should've sided with my gf?\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689417661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1508p63/aita_for_not_siding_with_my_gf_or_sister/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your GF did 3 shitty things in the post, and the only shitty thing your sister did was the way she called your GF out on it. If my GF threw a slushy on my brother and then left him without a car to get back home, i dont think i would have a GF much longer.\n\nEDIT: Or ESH except for your sister really", "NTA.

Your sister is weird for blowing up about your gf getting a different color. Your gf is actually a shit person for throwing a slushy at her.

You made a mature decision to remain neutral in a situation that was clearly very immature. While it may have hurt your girlfriend's feelings, it was a better alternative to taking sides and further escalating the tension between her and your sister. Holding a neutral stance doesn't make you the bad guy here, and it's likely for the best that you remain impartial until the two of them can settle their differences.", "Grow a pair and dump your gf.
