And I mean, he must be pretty sick, if he couldn't get from the shower to the toilet, before vomiting.", "Elementary school teacher? Going to work sick with a bug sounds like a terrible idea- both for himself and others involved. NTA.", "NTA. People who really feel fine don't vomit. He needs to stay home to avoid spreading anything he may have, or at least to avoid vomiting on other people.", "Nta don't be bringing vomiting into a school. Noro closes elementary schools all the time!!\n\n#EDIT\n\nThe only part of this that makes you an a****** is that you are doing his stuff as if he is a child. You better watch that division of labor or you're going to end up complaining over on 2X about \"how your husband doesn't do anything\"\n\nHe's a professional adult he needs to be calling his admin  himself and he needs to be doing his sub plans himself", "NTA. I'd be livid as a parent if my kid's teacher came to work when they'd been throwing up.", "NTA. Unless you are 100% sure of a non-infectious cause--and I'm guessing your boyfriend isn't pregnant--stay tf home if you vomit. If no other symptoms develop and it stops, maybe it was just a bad meal and he can consider returning.\n\nHe needs to be responsible and it's good you drew that line. Those poor kids and colleagues if he regularly ignores reasonable advice to prevent the spread of illnesses.", "NTA Virus get passed around in schools because teachers won't call in sick and parents send sick children to school.", "NTA   \nGoing anywhere when you're even slightly sick in this day and age is a huge AHOLE move.   \n\n\nGood on ya.    \n\n\nand dammit people I dont want your plagues stay home if you're not feeling well!", "NTA. I'm sorry your husband is sick, but it's a fact that he is. Staying home is the right move. That's what the sick days are *for*.", "He's the person I get on the train with all snot-nosed, coughing and heaving up phlegm acting like it's completely normal to expose the public to your germs so that everyone can experience the shit you're going through.", "INFO: Does he have any GI conditions that may cause him to vomit occasionally? For example, acid reflux?", "NTA - he doesn't need to go get other people sick.\n\nLaughing as I read this wondering if the OP is my daughter", "NTA, not only should he prioritise his health but I doubt any of his colleagues, pupils or their parents would thank him for going in so sick potentially vomiting in front of them and spreading disease. The kids could have vulnerable or elderly family members at home for whom stomach bugs are much more serious. I understand teachers are under pressure but when bodily fluids are flying around it isn\u2019t just a judgement call whether to stay home or work through. I don\u2019t understand why you had to do everything for him though because if he is insisting he was well enough to go in then he should definitely have been well enough to do the admin involved in his absence while making himself comfortable at home as that would be less strenuous. And then he doesn\u2019t appreciate the support. He acts as if he is doing you a favour not the other way around, like: \u2018oh if you irrationally insist I don\u2019t go into work while vomiting then I will grudgingly agreed to grant you this but only if you do the work involved in processing the absence!\u2019 What?", "Is this a real question?\n\nNo, you\u2019re NTA. After all the nonsense of the last 3 years and he still thinks it\u2019s ok to go to work while ill? With children, I might add?

Is he just gonna go for whatever reason and get them all sick? That is straight up AH behavior. Feels like people didn't learn from Covid and it makes me pretty mad.\n\nGeneral rant:\n\nI don't get the reason why sick days are so stigmatised by the employers. Doesn't help having a worker that can't work at his best and then getting others sick, who then in turn can't work well either. Makes more sense to have healthy workers and miss one for a few days that is back at 100% of their energy level.\n\nEDIT: text structure", "NTA - I wouldn't want him teaching my child if he is vomiting in the morning before school.", "YTA - not for making him stay home. That\u2019s totally fine and absolutely correct. But for the shower comment and treating him like a child. Who witnesses their partner throwing up and is like, hey, you better deep clean that tub before I shower tonight. So strange", "ESH - I mean, you are obviously correct. Sick people should not spread germs. It's a no-brainer. But when our SO's do dumb shit we can advise, recommend,  suggest. When you start forcing your SO to do what you think is right it changes the relationship. \n\nYou don't want to be the parent in your romantic relationship. Either learn to let some shit go or find a partner who will never make you want to treat them like a child. The first option is easier. There is no perfect SO.  (& for the record, \"some shit\" does not include alcohol/drug abuse, violence etc. Some shit = quirks, brain farts etc.)", "ESH. He shouldn\u2019t go to work if he is vomiting. If he vomits once ok if he\u2019s vomiting consistently and doesn\u2019t feel well he shouldn\u2019t go to work. But you also suck because why are you forcing him to do something? He\u2019s an adult, he can make his own decisions. \n\nSide note: I think you also suck for being like \u00ab\u00a0he needs to deep clean the shower before I can use it wah wah wah\u00a0\u00bb.

I still appreciate the thought of being cautious.", "If my girlfriend throws up into the tub and needs to stay home from work and rest, I\u2019m more than happy to clean the shower.

You don't know anything about this boyfriend and yet you are already making assumptions to defend the girlfriend's behaviour. \n\nThe shower comment is a bit problematic. In a healthy relationship, when one partner is down a bit, the other partner should take up a bit of the slack temporarily.

Pretty sure op's husband is not expecting.", "I think that\u2019s still weird since she\u2019s the one who has determined he\u2019s not going to work.
