I didn't expect so many responses or the hate I got, though I now realise how badly I fucked up. While I still think how people wrote about Maya was disgusting and unfair, how I treated Tia was cruel and ignorant. I was trying to help everyone and be practical, but I neglected to properly consider the emotional side. While unintentional I was just ignoring Tia's pain and trauma.\n\nThe responses were a wake-up call and I realised I was just going to ruin everything. While it wasn't meant that way, it would just hurt Tia and ruin our relationship. I managed to convince some friends to let Maya stay with them and looked for a place. Currently, Tia still lives with me, while I found a cheap one-bedroom for Maya. It's been rough financially but I managed to get everything my sisters need, a few sacrifices don't matter compared to them. Maya needed help adjusting and learning to be independent so I did have to focus on her initially, and Tia absolutely hated me giving her any attention so it was extremely difficult at first. But it got a lot better as Maya adjusted and grew more independent and I could balance my time better. It's not perfect but we've gotten into a rhythm the best we can. \n\nMaya has grown a lot, and can mostly live by herself now, though I obviously still help. Therapy has really helped her and she's made a lot of friends at university. While she still wants Tia's forgiveness, she's accepted it's not in her control and to focus on living her life and improving herself. I'm really happy she's free of our parents' influence, she's nothing like she used to be. Though I do wish I had tried harder when she was younger, rather than giving up.\n\nTia isn't completely happy, I don't think she'll ever forgive Maya. I've done my best to make it clear I love her, and Maya isn't my favourite but it's been hard. We get joint therapy that helps a lot, but she still wishes it was just us. Still she's finally able to understand that helping Maya isn't rejecting her. I'm so thankful and lucky Tia could forgive me, she means the world to me. I never intended to hurt her, though I clearly completely fucked up my approach. We basically just avoid the Maya situation, and have managed to get back to normal. She's such a strong woman, I'm honestly so proud of her and so ashamed of how short-sighted I was.\n\nAs selfish as it is, a part of me will always wish Tia could forgive her. But I know that's impossible and selfish. I don't think Tia will ever fully accept that Maya is a part of my life. The most I'll get is Tia and Maya being in one building for my wedding, but honestly that's enough for me. They're both victims of our parents, so I'm just glad they can both be happy and free. While it's not a fairy-tale ending, everything is going well. I'm glad I posted and was able to fix my horrible mistake.", "created_utc": 1677755233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g03tn/update_aita_choosing_the_golden_child_over_my/", "score": 6687, "replies": ["Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tzupq6/aita_choosing_the_golden_child_over_my_other/)", "I'm glad you were able to heed the wake-up call and see the situation more clearly.\n\nI'm glad you are all in therapy.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that feeling as long as you recognize that emotion for what it is. It sounds like your therapist is helping you do that.\n\nYou\u2019ve taken on a huge responsibility of caring for your siblings and saving them from a toxic environment. That burden should have never been yours in the first place. You are also a victim.\n\nAnd yet you\u2019ve managed to get yourself and your siblings in a position where it\u2019s possible to lead happy and healthy lives. \n\nYou\u2019ve updated AITA with the happiest ending possible. Give yourself some credit and walk away from the post.", "Don\u2019t listen to all the bullshit, fuckin\u2019 Reddit loves a story with a bad guy they can hate and a victim they can sympathise with. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing and sacrificing for your sisters is beyond admirable. You\u2019re a good person and the world needs more people like you. \n\nI hope you too can find your peace some day.", "r/NotTheAssholeAnymore\n\nthis is a really good turnaround OP! good job!", "I'm gonna be honest, you're still fucking up. The fact that you want Tia to forgiv Maya shows that you truly don't understand the trauma she's gone though and are still placing your own selfish desires for the absence of tension over her need for justice and peace.", "Honestly this is about as positive a result that could be hoped for, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found a way to help both of your sisters.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you stopped before you kicked Tia out. Hopefully you can repair your relationship with her.\n\nBut how the comments here can sit and judge you for trying to do your best in a crappy situation, step up, and try to help two girls who were emotionally abused is disgusting. Honestly, good luck with everything and I think what you\u2019re doing is amazing.", "Some people here need to breathe a little and stop looking for a monstrous villain to froth at.\n\nMaya was a literal child during the abusive dynamic that triggered all this, the youngest of the three, and while Tia's trauma and pain are incredibly valid, a child of abusive and neglectful parents who *knows* she is on thin fucking ice and needs to be constantly complicit to all this or else they will turn on *her... IS ALSO A VICTIM, GUYS. All three of them were victims of a very toxic, abusive parenting dynamic.*\n\nAnd yes, Tia is within her right to never want to forgive her. And to want nothing to do with her.\n\nTeam Tia. I hope her life goes as best as a life can go.\n\nBut the brother wishing all three of them could find some kind of peace isn't being a dick. He didn't push. He didn't cross anyone's boundaries in having that thought. He's just having some wishful thoughts. Are we calling the thought police now?\n\nReddit's moral viciousness, constantly trying to whip everyone down and projecting their own traumas, envies, hurts and internalized biases, is something else. Y'all get some sadistic pleasure from this and you need to invest in some nuance.", "Seems like you\u2019re doing the best you can in the situation.  And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to help both of them- a lot of people disregard that the golden child goes through trauma too in an abusive household.  As evidenced by this comment section.  You\u2019ve found way to achieve equilibrium, and you all have therapy support.  Good work, big brother.  There will undoubtably be more challenges ahead but I think you\u2019re on the right path.", "The irony of the bulk of the posters here implying you're unempathetic for caring about both sisters while unilaterally considering Maya the devil in this situation is honestly outstanding.\n\nThe situation isn't perfect and it sucks for all parties but it's one that tries to find the best outcome for all. I don't understand the vitriol here honestly. The posters here reek of selfishness and lack of empathy.", "I think you did great! As someone who\u2019s married to someone who\u2019s currently going through similar, although not quite as bad, problems, I completely understand what you did. What people here fail to understand is that both kids were abused, and you have to balance that. Even if one was a golden child, that is still abuse and it fucks them up big time, same as it fucks up the other kids that aren\u2019t the golden child. They are kids and they deserve a second chance. People here expect kids to have wisdom above their ages and identify their own bad behavior, it seems like they were never kids themselves.", "[deleted]", "I would consider this a positive update. Family dynamics can be very difficult and delicate. I think what a lot of commenters overlook is that Maya was 19 and 2 years younger than Tia at the time of reaching out to OP. When you left Tia was older and easier to connect with being 13 versus an 11 year old. Maya was 16 when Tia moved in with You and  she then became the only person your parents could unleash on or make do possible chores to \u2018enjoy themselves\u2019.  \nI award Maya for all the self reflection she accomplished before reaching out at 19 with possibly no therapy. There is no justification for how Maya treated Tia but all we can do as Humans is look at our past and improve from there. Maya has done that and overcome so much in the short period of a year to overcome her self guilt/hate for how she was in her youth and as a brother or another sibling it is commendable. There are lot of posts on this thread that never reach that closure-ish within siblings. Tia is young at 21/22 and forgiveness can take time being hurt so deeply and having a comparable of this is what my brother has done for me versus what my sister has done. Tia may just take time to come around or may not but all Maya can do is send a birthday card in the mail or write a letter to Tia every once in a while. Sometimes a text or call isn\u2019t as personal. Not advice or if this will work with what Maya has done to Tia but sometimes knowing that even if Tia doesn\u2019t want anything to do with Maya, it does not mean that Tia is not on Maya\u2019s mind, if that makes sense. I am glad that you worked things out to where you can have both of your sisters in your life that I know you care deeply for. Being an older sibling put in a position to support younger siblings even later in life can be difficult. \n\nI wish you three the best in all your futures.", "this is so sad for Tia. i hope she heals and puts an incredible amount of distance between you two. \n\ndiscuss with your therapist why you haven't accepted Tia's boundary and STILL want her to forgive maya.", "I\u2019m proud of you. Especially at having the selfish thought but realizing it\u2019s too much to ask. Continue helping your sisters, especially Tia. From one oldest sibling to the other, you\u2019re doing a good job but focus on yourself as well, if you break down then you can\u2019t be there for them.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s amazing how all the people here giving OP crap don\u2019t see that maya was a victim too of abusive parenting. People can change especially when they suffer from the same trauma themselves and realize how they were raised really fucked them up. She\u2019s making amends. By being on her own, cut parents off, apologizing and therapy. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be casted as a villain for the rest of her life for her acts as a child. Tia doesn\u2019t have to forgive either. Maya could very well be a trigger to her past. In her eyes Maya=parents. OP is older he sees and understands that Maya was a victim. He also didn\u2019t suffer like Tia did at the hands of Maya. So his experience would be different. So not moving her in was a GOOD move. \n\nIt\u2019s a shitty situation. But OP is doing a good thing for a sister who was abused herself. He\u2019s a good person and doesn\u2019t deserve the hate. Those parents CREATED this situation.", "OP, you\u2019re doing an extraordinary job In impossible circumstances. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s all anyone can ask. \n\nMy one piece of advice: stop feeding the trolls. You don\u2019t need to justify yourself to anyone. \n\nRest easy. You\u2019re doing enough.", "You're trying your best.  At 26, you're trying to remove the distorted lens that you were taught to have by your parents, just as much as Tia and Maya are trying to figure out who they are apart from your toxic parents and the environment they created.  And frankly, for someone who was gaslighted for so many years, you're doing a hell of a job.\n\n  \nThere are a LOT of people on reddit and in this sub who love to be vindicative and judgemental, perhaps because they don't feel like they don't have control over their own lives and it is their way of pushing back against their own personal issues they see playing out in this sub.   \n\n\nKeep going to therapy.   Keep engaging with everyone.  It will take time, but you will heal and be strong and be a source of inspiration to your sisters and those around you.", "NTA - seems like Tia is asking you to choose sides. You did choose - grace, compassion, and forgiveness. I understand why Tia would want you to choose her. She needs an advocate, and you were her savior. In her still developing mind, you were now going to save her abuser. I can absolutely appreciate her perspective. But when removed from an abusive environment AND received therapy to help the individuals grow and heal, people do change for the better. I love your humanity and compassion. You did right by Tia - showing her that even sinners need saving. \n\nYou made a mistake when you initially tried to help Maya. But, you found a great work-around. I applaud your commitment to your sisters. IMO, I think Tia needs to feel like she is your golden-sister. She has a lot of healing to get through. But without forgiveness, she will never find that peace. Keep in mind, forgiveness does not mean forgetting. It also does not include having a relationship with Maya. It's simply letting go of the anger so that she can move forward.", "I hope tia has a wonderful life and is successful in all her endeavours. As for maya I hope karma come bk around because she made a person's childhood shit because she joined her parents to bully her. She only changed her mind when the nastiness of her parents turned on HER. She says it's because she was jealous of your relationship with tia. So at 2yrs older she wanted tia to be completely alone. You still talk about maya as a great person but not so much about tia. Would she have been apologetic to tia if her parents didn't turn on her. Remember she became an adult before she got in touch.\n\nYes you are being selfish and still don't fully get the trauma these people did to tia as a little girl. She wasn't safe in her home she was bullied and hated for existing. No wonder she insecure about her home when you wanted to move her abuser in. You pay for everything for maya and tia pays rent. So still favourites.", "I think you should give up the wish of making up between the two. I know you mean well and all, but for as long as you hold on to that wish, your will act unintentionally and unconsciously to that wish. You will one day hurt your sisters because of one wrong action. Just give up on that, let everyone go separate way and heal.", "You keep painting Maya as some unknowing tool that your parents used to abuse Tia. Maya was 16 when Tia left. Old enough to know that cruelty is wrong. People keep downplaying psychological abuse because it isn\u2019t visually visible. Think of it as if it was physical. Every day Maya flailed the skin from Tia. Every day she bled and hurt while being told to suck it up. And while she hurt, Maya stood there grinning and enjoying her pain. That is who Tia sees every time she thinks of Maya. The grinning monster who enjoyed inflicting pain. And that is who you wish she would forgive. I wouldn\u2019t bet on ever getting them in the same room together. Not even for your wedding.\n\nThankfully Maya have realized the error of her upbringing and is taking steps to better herself. It will take years of hard work to remove 16 years of indoctrination. She can absolutely do it, and I think she already is well on her way. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she sometimes relapses in stressed situations. No one can do a complete 180 like that. It\u2019s a process and takes work.", "I think it might be helpful for you to understand/read up on how family systems work. By getting the scapegoat (Tia) and the rescuer (yourself) out of the house, the system broke apart. Which is why Maya didn't want to stay there anymore. The broken system always needs a scapegoat to project their negtive feelings on, which didn't work anymore with Tia out. And without you trying to fix things between the persecutors/abusers, the system likely collapsed.\n\nThough that doesn't mean that Maya magically changed as a person (golden child, entitled, abusive). She just isn't in a system anymore where she can live her learned role.\n\nYou think that because you don't see Maya as the entitled brat that she was anymore that she's changed, but it is more than likely that she will slip back into her role if Tia ever decided that she want's to \"make up\" with her sister. She'll be back to put her down again in no time.\n\nYou might not be consciously aware of it, but you want the system to go back to what it was. You are still very much the codependent/rescuer trying to fix things, Tia will be the scapeoat (again), and Maya will be the persecutor (again). \n\nDon't let it happen. Let the system stay broken. Stop fixing things. Every member of your family needs to learn to get out of their roles.", "Tia is definitely the Asshole here, your trying to help them both and she's just not supporting that.", "INFO: \n\nWhat, if anything, have you done as an apology to Tia for your colossal fuck-up? And your fuck-up was on the scale of giving a kid a 30 day eviction notice on their 18th birthday, saying \"my house, my rules, suck it up, get over it, put on your grown-up pants, and piss off\", and then turning your back on them. \n\nI ask because you make no mention of any kind of apology or anything. Just of getting Maya out of there.", "I feel so bad for Tia. I hope she can eventually move out and never look back. She has suffered too much from this family, with this situation included. Poor girl.", "I understand that you did your best but no amount of reasonings and explanations will change the fact that you are footing the bill for your sister's abuser. Maya can change and redeem herself as much as she wants, but that will never undo the psychological scars SHE inflicted onto somebody. She will always be Tia's abuser. She will always be the person who inflicted years of trauma onto her. The fact that she was a victim too doesn't erase the fact that she was also an abuser. You can claim you love your sister all you want, but at the end of the day you still went above and beyond to protect her abuser and nearly displaced her and kicked her out to make room for the person who inflicted years of damage onto her. Karma bit Maya in the ass, but Tia is the one who will always have to live with the knowledge that the one person she trusted will always be protecting the person she needed protection and peace from :(", "Yikes, clearly you don\u2019t get it. This could still end with Tia going no contact. You still make her abuser a priority. I get Maya was a kid, but it sounds like the damage she did (along with your parents) was extensive. You acknowledge that she isn\u2019t happy and you can\u2019t about the Maya situation forever. Quite honestly at some point you will probably have to make a choice.", "Color me confused as to why it is the OP's job to house/financially support either adult sister. He is the brother, not the parent.", "For what it's worth, OP, I don't think you were choosing Maya \"over\" Tia. Maya was a child when all of this went down, and she didn't realize how much she was being manipulated. As my GC sister experienced when she became an adult, GC status is always conditional when kids are the product of narcissists. Maya was only acting as an agent of your parents because that's how they taught her to be.\n\nThe fact that Maya is trying to change speaks volumes. I also hope that Tia can learn to forgive her, knowing that your parents were really the ones at fault.", "I can\u2019t really believe anyone shamed you for this!  Maya was a CHILD. Not saying all actions are excused but you really can\u2019t judge her so harshly knowing her age and abuse from parents that was going on.", "Definitely stop trying to get Maya to forgive Tia, they need to work that out by themselves, and I'm looking for the part where Maya tries to apologize and make amends with Tia. Saying it doesn't make it true, needs to demonstrates being considerate for her on her terms consistently.\n\nIt's great you are helping your sisters get healthy feet on the ground but reading these I can't help but feel you are giving Maya preference because she states she's willing to reconcile even though I see that as an unfair perspective.\n\nYou're entitled to an agenda of your own, just keep in mind that's not being magnanimous. \n\nGood luck and I hope you can all move past it and forgive. I adore my sisters and it would tear at me too if they didn't get along.", "Poor Tia", "Oh yeah thanks. Forgot to do that!", "Thank you, it definitely helped. If it wasn't for that I would have lost Tia I think. \n\nThe therapy really has helped. Maya and Tia have improved so much from back at our parents. And our therapist helped us accept and understand each other's feelings on this. I'm so glad Tia was willing to let me apologize and try to fix it, and especially get that counselling with me.\n\nWe actually still go every two weeks. Even if the Maya issues are sorted it still helpful with everything else and our parents", "[deleted]", "She's doing really well at uni so I'm certain she'll be able to. I'll support whatever choice she makes, though when she finally gets her own place I will definitely miss her. She's a lot smarter than me so she'll definitely go far whatever she chooses", "Jesus Christ this man is getting raked over the coals for trying to do best for his two sisters when he himself is a youngster. He says he wishes the sisters could forgive each other which is obvious to any sane person, never said he was forcing them too.", "Thank you for this comment. obviously tia is the victim here, but mayas behavious was the product of poor upbringing by their parents. the subreddit fails to acknowledge that people are able to grow and evolve and move past mistakes that were made. its as if people think once the bad guy, always the bad guy. maya was a child, she hadnt/ and probably still hasnt fully developed.  \n\ni applaud OP for wanting peace with his two sisters and find critism of him quite unfair.", "I'm glad someone else said it, I thought I was going crazy for a bit. OP is clearly doing his best and may have made a few missteps in handling it, but obviously cares about both of his sisters which isn't a bad thing. It's a sad situation.", "It's crazy I had to scroll so long for this take. OP's clearly trying to be a good person and help *everyone* but this thread is just shitting on him. All three of the children were abused, but no one is taking that into consideration.\n\nOP should be commended for all he's done to get **both** of them out of that situation. Rather than dumped on by reddit.", "That's not what I meant.\n\nI didn't mean she should or that I'm trying to make it happen. It's like how I'll always wish our parents loved us, even though I know it'll never happen.\n\nI'm not putting this first. Our therapist has helped us a lot. She thinks where we are is healthy, even if not perfect\n\nA crush on someone you married doesn't mean you actually want to commit adultery or will act on it. The feelings themselves aren't the issue. \n\nAs our therapist said, it's fine for me to want a loving family, as long as I can accept Tia feelings and boundaries. Which I am", "He is also paying for the apartment or did I read that wrong?", "[deleted]", "Agreed! OP sounds like a nice guy who is truely trying his best in a terribly difficult situation and he's getting so much hate for it! Some of these comments are insane to me!", "I know. I majorly fucked up. I was so focussed on practicality I ignored her feelings. It wasn't that I lack empathy, I just got caught up in wanting to end our parents control and abuse. Tia means the absolute world to me. The only reason I could make such a horrible mistake was because I thought she could still understand. I didn't realise I would lose her.\n\nEither way I'm so proud of her. She's an amazingly strong woman. Certainly smarter than me (admittedly not hard). She's still not interested in dating, but I know I'll really miss her when she does finally move out.", "Well... Tia was willing to let her sister be abused by their parents... \n\nMaya might have been the golden child and bullied Tia but it is clear that it was a surviving mechanism... I'm not gonna blame a child.for.wanting to survive... \n\nHe had to get Maya out of there! You talk about lacking empathy... But where is yours for Maya and OP? They are victims as well!", "I think it may not have been worded clearly. I HAVE accepted her boundary.\n\nI meant it in the same way as I wish our parents loved us and didn't abuse us. Our therapist HAS gone over this with us, repeatedly. It's thanks to her we can properly understand each other here.", "Thank you. Those comments hurt a lot but it made me realise how horrible I was being. I'm definitely going to be there for them all. I love my sister more than anything (don't tell my partner haha).\n\nThough she does tell me that too. But I only have so much money. And ultimately those two are more important than me.", "She was a child who\u2019s parents abused her and brainwashed her against her siblings\u2026she was a victim of her parents as well. It\u2019s similar to parental alienation. Which is abusive to the child.", "I understand she was wrong as a child. But this isn't some manipulative plot. She's not a monster.\n\nBoth of them were victims. And Tia is right to stay away if that's what she needs. But Maya isn't that same girl desperate for our parents love. She's not lying. She's open about her mistakes, and her growth is real. Her therapist isn't just for show.", "'karma'? None of us deserves our parents. If karma existed all of us deserve better.\n\nBut even assume you're right, it did get Maya. She's been punished for what she did. Her sister will always hate her. She lost her brother for years. She has been abused by our parents from day one. \n\nShe didn't want Tia to leave. That was my fuck up. And she was abused the whole time, the golden child is a victim too. Just because she needed time to realise her doesn't mean she deserves to be scorned for life.\n\nAnd it's not favourite. Tia lived with me for free until she CHOSE to contribute. I didn't make her. And even now I'm paying for all their therapies, and most necessities.", "It's not that kind of wish. I wish I had good parents, but I'm hardly suddenly treating them better than my sister.", "I'm honestly glad you've never been in the situation to understand this. But she was taught to act that way. It was the only way to get our parents love. The one thing children INSTINCTIVELY crave. She didn't know better because she was rewarded for that behaviour. Me or Tia saying no didn't work when our parent manipulated her into believing it. \n\nShe is taking the work. She's in therapy, she's doing everything she can to move on and improve. She was the fucking victim as well. Even our therapist has tried to explain it similarly.", "That's not what's happening. She literally sees two (solo and joint with me) therapists that can attest that your full of shit about her. I don't know why everyone is so cynical. She has matured and realised she's wrong.\n\nIf anything is codependent it's Tia and me, with how she's struggling with my engagement.", "I think you have been living your whole life sheltered and have never been hurt or abused. Good for you, but you will never understand people who were and are abused. If that's so, please keep silent because you are talking like an asshole here.", "I think you did great! As someone who\u2019s married to someone who\u2019s currently going through similar, although not quite as bad, problems, I completely understand what you did. What people here fail to understand is that both kids were abused, and you have to balance that. Even if one was a golden child, that is still abuse and it fucks them up big time, same as it fucks up the other kids that aren\u2019t the golden child. They are kids and they deserve a second chance. People here expect kids to have wisdom above their ages and identify their own bad behavior, it seems like they were never kids themselves.", "Or maybe Tia will realise her brother who let her moves with him at 23 and is getting them all therapy is someone to keep in her life.", "[deleted]", "And I'm sure she will go far far away as soon as she is able...", "Wow. A lot of people in here ready to cast judgment on all of these children and not pointing fingers at the adults. You moved out when you were 18 from an abusive family situation. That's not failure. That's survival. You did what you could for your sister Tia and you've honestly gone above and beyond what you could reasonably expect to do, but you are not a parent. You're a brother, and at the end of the day only four years older than Tia. You have essentially been forced to step in and be a parent to both of these girls, who are honestly now adults. And Tia is about as old as you were when you took her in and took over as her single parent and entire support network.\n\nMeanwhile, people want you to completely cut out someone who was also abused, and who is going through a difficult growing up process where she comes to terms with some of her own shitty behavior as a child. But at the same time, SHE WAS A CHILD. And I'm sorry, on the spectrum of things where children are also roving in gangs and beating people to death and stealing cars, being a brat is really not the worst thing to be.\n\nYeah, support Tia. If she forgives Maya, it must be on her own time and her own schedule. And I'll be honest with you: she may need to move entirely across the country and stand on her own feet for a while before she's ready to think about something like that. That's what it took for me.\n\nBut you as their brother don't need to pick sides here. Except against your abusive family, who put you in this shitty situation where you don't get to be a young adult because you're so busy processing the trauma of your sisters and trying to navigate their feelings.\n\nYou are also a victim here.", "I disagree with other people in this thread. I think you\u2019re doing your level best in a hard situation, and supporting people who clearly have both undergone trauma. No one\u2019s behaviour is perfect.

I was the one who on both sides. Just give you some perspectives. My then-good friend and I had a very bad and damaging argument/discord, we talked, and the last things he said to me were:\n\n> My friend: \"For everyone's benefits you had to take the short end, although you did nothing wrong.\"\n\n> Me: \"Then I want to ask, if you were me, and I were you, would you stay friend with me if I treated you like you did to me?\"\n\n> My friend: \"No, I wouldn't.\"\n\nThat was the last time we talked.

He can wish for loving bonds between his family and still understand that its not (currently, or may not ever be) possible. Doesn't mean he's stomping on his sister's boundaries, just that he's expressing an old hurt that will probably hurt forever. It's entirely normal, and actually healthy for him to express. Traumatic family dynamics are a trip and a half, especially for the children that still need healing. At least they're all in therapy for it.\n\nLet me repeat: this poor guy is still healing himself. He's not going to say the right things or do the right things 100% of the time because he is still healing, himself. This is still a very fragile wound all these kids are dealing with.

All 3 of you were the victims. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s harder for you to deal with it and crave this peace between them.\n\nAny sort of child abuse (psychological or physical) differs between siblings. The risk of victimization is lower when a child has more siblings overall, and even lower when those are older siblings. As the oldest child, you probably didn\u2019t get that benefit.\n\nMiddle children are often neglected and struggle with abandonment issue and often become co-dependent in their relationships. Tia went from being the middle child to the oldest and for 5-ish years, she took the escalating brunt of it.\n\nThen both of you are gone and for two years, Maya gets ALL of it! Real fast, real quick, super intense.\n\nTia is probably thinking that the only person who was truly there for her, her anchor, doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s enough. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what you think.\n\nBut the thing is, at the root of all of this, you had to grow up so fast (too fast) to care for them.

Sure, he messed up by not taking his one sister's trauma into account. Yes, that I'll give you, but he's also just a brother who also grew up in a traumatic home. He's not going to make the best decisions 100% of the time. He is, however, trying to do better. That's what I'm choosing to focus on. He realized he messed up and is trying to make amends while trying to help another traumatized sister. That's a whole dynamic to consider.

The idea that he's stomping on boundaries by expressing a wish for a whole, loving family is a bit silly. I want a whole, loving family too. I know it won't happen. I know we are broken beyond repair and that I will only ever have a few of my siblings in my life. Doesn't mean I stop wanting a whole, loving family with healthy family members. He's allowed to want that. Literally everyone wants that. That's my biggest point. He hasn't pushed her to accept an apology. He asked if she was willing, she said no, so he's accepted that. That's a normal conversation to have when your family life is so messed up that kids can't even talk to their parents anymore. \n\nI didn't say \"it's ok to stagnate\" with a \"chipper tune\".

Don\u2019t let tia make you feel guilty for having a relationship with maya.", "Honestly Tia and Maya are two sides of the same coin. Tia was your golden child and maya was your parents. Tia is older and still seems very codependent on you. And being the golden child was never Mayas fault so while Tias feelings toward her sister are valid they are a little misdirected. This is all your parents fault. \n\nBut overall I think you are doing an amazing job. Essentially raising two girls (where one isn\u2019t making it easy for you to support the other) on your own.", "Tia needs to tell him, bye, don\u2019t contact me\u2026 ever again", "It's only been 2ish hours so I am hoping more sensible commenters come to upvote the proper takes.

I swear people in this subreddit only want posts of people being actual AHs. \n\nOP is truly doing his best & literally recognized that he shouldn't have put Tia in that position. Hell, OP took her to joint therapy to work through what he had previously asked her.", "Thank you for saying this. I had a similar situation in my household growing up. I was the scapegoat and golden child depending on the day. It changed all the time. I did some things I really regret as a child and hurt one of my siblings as well. The only way I received any love from my mother (it is normal and natural for a child to seek love from a parent) was when I hurt my sister. That's just how it was my whole life and I didn't realize how fucked up that is until I was 15. \nWhen you grow up in abusive conditions, your perception is always warped. For me, my moral compass was completely distorted in this aspect. How could something be so wrong when it's the only way my mom will love me?\n I carry a lot of guilt and shame for the things I did (mostly as a child 10 and under). My sister will never forgive me for that, which is her choice. While she has that right, I forgive myself. I was a CHILD. I was a child seeking love from my parents.\n\n Narc parents actively try to turn siblings against each other, and this situation is an excellent example of that.\nOp has done more than should have ever been required of him and truly stepped up to bring healing to their lives. Op is the hero of this sad story. It's natural for op to want unity between the siblings, and op is right. The best way to overcome narc parents is to band together.", "Golden Children are also abuse victims and I\u2019m so sick of people acting like they\u2019re monsters for actions they did to survive abuse as kids.", "I whole heartedly agree.  All three were victims of their parents, and navigating abuse is not easy.  OP obviously had his heart in the right place but got stuck in \"hero\" mode and forgot to look around at what he might damage when he was saving people from the villains that are their parents. Just like superheroes do all that damage to the city, OP almost permanently damaged his relationship with Tia when he was single-mindedly focused on \"saving\" Maya.  I understand that desire.  But he listened to the feedback.  He took that step back that was needed. Slowed down. And he did what was necessary to make the transition less damaging.  \n\nThey all still endured pain from the situation.  It was somewhat inevitable.  But what's done is done, and now they have to move forward.  OP can wish things were better and not act on those wishes.  They are in therapy together. I think OP is doing all he can to heal the family.", "I haven't seen em since the day I picked Tia up. And none of my sister are in touch at all.", "Agreed - I love when some redditors argue that the brain is not mature until 25 but if you look at the timeline, OP\u2019s had to become an adult at 18.  Then at 21 he took in his abused sister and became her parent and then two years later took responsibility for a second abused sister.  Without a doubt all were abused just in different ways.  Everyone is just assigning malevolence to Maya who was raised to act the way she acts.  I\u2019ve seen people give more grace to an abused and aggressive dog then they do to a child who was conditioned from a young age to act the way she did.  I\u2019m actually giving Tia a side eye - not because of her not forgiving Maya - its her right to not want a relationship- but because she is not accepting of OP\u2019s relationship with his fianc\u00e9e.  She needs to work on that.  After everything OP has gone through in his short life he\u2019s entitled to happiness as well.", "I think many of the commenters are being a bit unfair to OP.

I know my partner doesn't fully agree with it, but if I can get what they need it's enough.

My reasoning?  All of you dealt with abuse.  Many would disown and disappear from all familial association - but you did not.  Supporting your siblings is NOT your responsibility - but you did it anyways... That is character.", "I think the takeaway is that he was never truly the Asshole, he had a difficult situation and was just looking out for both of his siblings.", "how and when was he ever the asshole", "Or maybe the abuse was so horrible that Tia can't forgive Maya yet. It's easy to say 'Oh Tia should be willing to forgive Maya because she's changed or why wouldn't OP want to help both sisters. We don't know what Tia went through when OP left the house or how damaging it was for her. She fled to her 'safe' person to escape the abuse and then that person turned around to help her abuser. Tia probably was horrified to know that OP had forgiven her abuser. Just because OP has forgiven Maya doesn't mean that Tia ever will.", "Lmao. The responses I\u2019m reading here is really hilarious. Op made an asshole move, got feedback and realized his mistake and has not only owned it up and changes. Sure damage may be done, but \u201cthe jar is broken and I can\u2019t mend it with regret.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so funny how all the time on Reddit people say it\u2019s not your kid, not your responsibility and you don\u2019t owe siblings/nieces anythjng, free babysitting, free services etc. well OP stepped up. He took in his siblings when he\u2019s not responsible for them. And yeah they are messed up but technically adults as well. Further, all 3 were abused, it\u2019s not like Maya wasn\u2019t part of the absue. Sure it may not have been as long or intense, and no way does it justify her behavior towards Tia, but she too has a victim as well. So the OP would like the Tia to forgive Maya. So what? It sounds like he knows the difference between wishing and acting. He\u2019s already said he\u2019s not forcing it. What\u2019s wrong with him hoping for something and both realizing that it\u2019s not happening and also not forcing it. If he vocalizes it and attempts to force it then yes he continues to be the AH. But I\u2019d we take what he says at face value and he\u2019s hoping it on the inside but not actively pursuing it, I see no issues with that. \n\nAnd finally all these suggestions from other posts about getting therapy and working on yourself blah blah blah.

Or wishing your parents who are divorced would get back together...you are allowed to feel those things even though you know they won't happen!

The pain continues after the abusive parent has left the room rather than the kids loving and supporting each other.\n\nIt's still working here since Tia sees Maya as the abuse rather than as a fellow victim.\n\nMaya was never actually a favorite or loved since she received all the same abuse and more as soon as there wasn't anyone else around for the parents to bother splitting kid loyalties over.\n\nOf course OP wanted to rescue his sister from the same abuse he and Tia suffered.  It's not his fault that Tia cannot emotionally handle recognizing her sister as a fellow survivor.

And it just takes a lot of bullshit from another person to really tip the scales and finally work out what's happening there.\n\nApart from that, ALL therapists have a responsibility to their client first, so the fact that anyone says \"my therapist would disagree with you\" means absolutely nothing. They're not there to judge people, but work through their emotions.\n\nEven in family therapy it is a known problem that the more self-centered, egocentric, manipulative, members of families cannot be called out on their bullshit, because that would lead to a possible rupture of the therapeutic relationship.

When a bully apologizes and expects their victim to absolve them, when forgiveness is to benefit the bully, not the victim. It takes time to rebuild trust. Sometimes people can be pushed too much and relationships can't be fixed. You don't need to forgive those who do you harm; forgiving is not necessary for moving on. Forgiveness should be for the benefit of the victim not the abuser. Maya may have been a victim too and become a better person but that doesn't take away the harm she was an accessory to (the true assholes are your parents, but it really doesn't matter how much autonomy Maya had in this aspect - it doesn't change what impact it had and still has on Tia). It might be especially harder since your first approach was to pressure Tia to forgive Maya and live with her in an extremely short amount of time while invalidating Tia's past experiences.\n\nI personally think most people can change and I'm glad Maya is in a happier place.\n\nI'm really glad things are working out.

Having been in both positions, I can say that while the \"golden child\" treatment isn't nearly as  demoralizing in an immediate sense, it is abusive. Parents do no favors for their children by weaponizing them against their siblings. Not only does it alienate them from people they should be bonding with and put them in the crossfire of intense conflict, it puts a sense of guilt and responsibility for the conflict on the child. You manipulate the child into helping to create the dynamic, and make them believe it was their idea. The child also has a sense, correctly, that the parent's love for them is conditional. If they don't play along, they lose the approval. This is incredibly damaging. Maya was a victim of abuse, too. The entire time. Not just once Tia left.

If they are acting abusive, it's an act of distress.\n\nAnd yes, a \"golden child\", youngest of the three, watching the other two being abused, neglected, berated and unloved, and knowing every moment that the instant she steps out of line she will be the next target, knowing the moment she doesn't align herself with the parents and the abuse she will be tossed aside? Being transformed into a weapon of parental cruelty, being used against her loved ones, taught to be that way, formed into someone condemned to being poorly socialized, unlikeable, scared and yet self-centered? Horrible trauma. Even if in Tia's and other people's eyes that child might have seemed spoiled or favoured.\n\nHonestly kudos on Maya for trying to become a better person, for breaking out of that conditioning.", "I agree that how people are treating maya is wild.\n\nBut how does it seem like Tia is just jealous? We have half the story, and op even says maya verbally and psychologically abused her for 5 years when OP wasn\u2019t there. Tia\u2019s feelings are completely valid here. Regardless of what maya was going through, to Tia she is one of her abusers. Why is it so easy for you to go the other way from vilifying one child to the other?

Your parents were the Assholes here and even if your sisters never have a relationship with each other I hope they can continue to have a healthy relationship with you.

OP was abused by their parents and no helped him. He became the rock for these young women and one of them doesn\u2019t seem to understand the sacrifices he has made to make sure her life gets to be easier.

And it's almost impossible for a teen that age to break the pattern of dynamics created by the parents until she reaches some degree of psychological and social independence.\n\nAnd lo and behold, as soon as she reached that stage, Maya immediately did, in fact, want to break out of the horrible, weaponized role she had been forced into.\n\nI know all of you really want to project onto Maya all of the one-dimensional cliches of \"Mean Girl\" popular chicks you hated when you were 13, but real life has a lot more nuance than that.  \n\n\nHold the parents accountable, stop *adding* to the abusive triangulation of pitting siblings against one another.", "No - those harsh comments were not needed.

Since he has the mental fortitude to put his trauma aside, he is now shouldering the burden of supporting two sisters who aren\u2019t making it easier on him in any way. If my brother was supporting me financially, and emotionally I would feel terrible asking him to accommodate me even more over our other sibling because I wasn\u2019t mentally prepared to forgive her. Maya and OP were both abused as well. If Tia can\u2019t afford to pitch in financially then that just proves how little support OP is getting in this situation. Again, he is paying the lion share of rent on two apartments so his sisters can have better lives. Why is Tias trauma and abuse more important than OP\u2019s? He is expected to put his to the side to accommodate and support his siblings, but they can\u2019t do the same for him in return?", "That\u2019s cool. Sorry if I was a bit rough. My blood is just boiling on OP\u2019s behalf. To be doing such wonderful things for his sisters and then so thoroughly maligned by Redditors was so damaging.

I\u2019m not asking for all the specifics, I asked for anything at all. Personally I think most commenters here are being really hard on Maya, who was, it appears, raised in an actual, verifiably based on your comments psychological abusive situation. If she was consistently able to get your parents love and attention all her life by doing these things and doing the things she was told, and from what it sounds like that\u2019s probably the only way she got love and attention then it sounds like she was kind of if not totally brainwashed. She was pitted against her sister by her parents and received parental validation and love when she demonstrated that she was allied with your parents and against her sister. This is how she was raised, from childhood. How can we expect her to one day magically wake up and realize the situation is f*cked and she\u2019s going to tell her parents off, fck their love and attention. It\u2019s not uncommon for kids (and adults) who have been neglected, emotionally/ verbally or even physically abused to stay in contact or ignore the abuse just to have the moments of feeling loved, connected by a parent. \nI\u2019ll probably be downvoted into oblivion for having such a different take, so maybe I\u2019m missing something here. Personally, it would help me understand where this level of anger and resentment from Tia- when this is really about your parents, to have a little more detail OR an example or two of what was said to her- is coming from. I AM NOT COMPLETELY ABSOLVING MAYA. But it\u2019s clear when she saw how awful your parents were, that there was no special bond between her and them and that she had been manipulated and used her entire life she did reach out. You say she has genuine guilt and remorse and I believe you. Imagine how she must have felt when the truth became clear to her about your parents. First she finds out there relationship was bs, then after some reflection I\u2019m sure, starts to realize just how badly she treated Tia. As mentioned, I\u2019d really like to have some clue as to what I\u2019m talking about here when I say \u201chow bad she treated Tia\u201d but presumably. Knowing this would also help me understand and not feel a bit judgey about the fact that Tia expected you to just reject Maya from your life. \nFinal question: Why are you and Tia in therapy together in the first place? Did that start over this issue or were you seeing a therapist together in the first place?", "\"The only priority above them is hypothetical future children.\"\n\nI hope your fiance is on that list as well. after you get married your wife should be your first priority .Especially because of how  understanding she is being.  you need to be careful and make sure that mia's fear of losing you does not make your fiance feel as if she comes second when your wife should be first priority as well", "She was already in therapy, but we started joint over this. \n\nFor the abuse it depended. She definitely rubbed in it her face that our parents loved her not Tia.she would regularly insult her, call her stupid, ugly, unlovable, etc. There were a few times she basically tried to convince her I didn't love her, which was one of the few times Tia actually got violent. \n\nWhen we were younger I had to basically raise them so i always had to.mediate. the main difference was that our parents would take Maya out sometimes, give her gifts or praise. They would punish me and Tia any time Tia misbehaved, but laugh and reward Maya. The difference in treatment cause all the issue despite how hard I tried. I could only fix so much. Though Maya was always confused why I didn't seem to love her as much as our parents.", "It's perfectly fine to wish that Tia could forgive Maya and they could be a happy family as long as he's not acting on it. I wish my mom could have been a better parent and this is no different.", "Yeah that's just not true.", "Info: how are your parents?\n\nLike I can\u2019t imagine the thought process of all kids leaving the house shortly after they turned 18 and thinking they did a good job. Like how on earth did they lose you and not get the memo that they absolutely suck at parenting and they should try harder with the next 2 so they don\u2019t lose all 3. Obviously I have no sympathy for them, I\u2019m just genuinely confused how people could be this evil.", "It is facinating to me that a child who grows up in poverty and turns to a life of crime, drugs, and gangs is viewed as a victim of their circumstances (as they should be) but a child who grows up spoiled with no proper behavior or goodness modeled to them and behaves badly AS A CHILD should be punished for the rest of their life even when they learn, grow, and change.\n\nMaya is as much a victim of her upbringing as you and Tia are.  You are a decent, kind person to look beyond her childhood behvior and see the good person she is striving to become.  Tia must make her own journey.  Frankly, her hatred really hurts herself more than anyone else.  Holding on to hate, anger, and bitterness is like a poison to the soul.  But she must deal with that on her own terms.  Forgiveness, if she ever decided to grant it, won't be for Maya it will be for her.  Maya is learning a very valuable lesson that somethings can't be taken back and sorry doesn't fix things.  That lesson will make her a better person.  \n\nI am glad that things are working out and that your relationship with your sisters is growing.

The way you are talking in this post, I would have thought you did something terrible.  Yeah, maybe it would have been rough on Tia to have Maya just move in like that.

As such, if you wanted to let Maya (or anyone else) move in as well, that's entirely your choice (assuming your landlord doesn't have a problem and/or it would violate your lease).

I never tried to defend Maya's actions toward Tia or said Tia was wrong for not forgiving her, but the mere mention that Maya was a kid in a shitty situation who her abusive parents manipulated was met with horrible backlash. \n\nLike, she was a child who was modeling her parents. If you grow up that way, you're going to learn or at least think that this is appropriate behavior. \n\nObviously, that doesn't make it ok, and Tia shouldn't be forced to forgive her, but we, as outside observers, can at least look at the full picture from a distance.", "True, I'm not saying that OPs sisters will ever have a normal relationship or that Tia will want to be around Maya ever again. I doubt that will ever happen, at best she may be able to be civil if there are times where they have no choice to be in the same space (ie OPs wedding) but I doubt it would be more than that. \n\nIt's just something that Tia just doesn't realise yet, and maybe realising it may be more beneficial for her to help her heal.", "You are not entitled to personal information about others to satisfy your own curiosity.

Everyone has been worried about Tia and haven\u2019t even given a thought to OP. He\u2019s young and has now the burden of 2 ADULT sisters - and he pays for both! Tia can be upset and not forgive Maya, but to expect OP to bend over backwards is selfish behavior. Maya isn\u2019t the gold child anymore, AND it was never her fault she was. She was a brat, but she was the product of her parents. If she\u2019s grown since then it\u2019s wrong to hold this against her imo, especially when it burdens the person who loves you the most financially. Does OP even do anything for himself?", "Is he though? Is he putting his trauma aside for them, or is he stuck in the role he's *always* had. He talks a lot of game about therapy. But neither of these posts indicate he's getting anything from it. He's doing exactly what he's always done. Taken care of the girls and mediated their issues. He's been parentified and is still stuck in the thick of doing it.", ">Obviously, that doesn't make it ok, and Tia shouldn't be forced to forgive her, but we, as outside observers, can at least look at the full picture from a distance.\n\nExactly, yes Maya's behaviour was awful, and there's no excusing it, but she was also in the same abusive environment where she was used as a pawn/tool against her siblings and obviously as a child, she was going to do whatever it took to make sure that the abuse being directed at her siblings wasn't directed at her, *which it was* when she was *still a freaking child*.\n\nLike I said, people are just shitting on Maya because she was the Golden Child, and therefore beyond redemption for her behaviour as a child, because for people on reddit it's easier to hate the golden child than put the blame where it really belongs, on the parents, because the Golden Children are victims of abuse too.", "Ugh that makes me even sadder to think about. I just hope he is okay and doesn\u2019t burn out. I hope this family finds a way to recover.

If you look at it that way, her such strong reactions are understandable. She is a victim of abuse and you very nearly invited the abuser to come live with you.", "God bless, what a mess. Its absolutely heartbreaking. Im surprised that her therapist hasnt pointed out to Tia that Maya is just as much a victim of your parents, the only difference is, is.that she was used as a pawn/weapon. In some ways, her pain may be greater. Not only was she abused & used by her parents, she was shunned (i get why) by her siblings. She was just a child. A manipulated child. What kid doesnt trust what their parents tell them? Sounds like you & Tia made maya the enemy because she was less scary than confronting your parents.

Then she cared about what was happening because it was happening to her. She never cared about what she did to her own sister. And she was old enough to know better. Those comments were not too harsh at all. \n\nThe only person I feel bad for is Tia. She deserves so much better. OP did an amazing thing taken care of her when it was not his responsibility. But some of these people in these comments need to think about Tia and everything she went through. Imagine having your own parents and your own sibling. Be your abuser.

And people also seem to gloss over the fact that OP was abused himself. And him and Tia both left home at 18, and while Tia had OP, he himself was alone trying to navigate the world.\n\nOP was able to recognize that all three of them were victims and needed help and I applaud him for that, not many would have the will and strength that OP showed.", "> sometimes even the people that hurt us deserve a second chance and a little help\n\nOfcourse they do! They even deserve a third chance, and a fourth and fifth etc. That doesn't mean that their victim should be the one to give them said chances and help though.", "Since we don't have a written list of what Maya actually did to Tia, we have to go by what OP has stated.

If she had remained the golden child, would she have ever changed her treatment of Tia?\n\nTo Tia and some Redditors Maya was complicit in the abuse.

That said, Tia\u2019s trauma is real and still being worked through and she may never get to the point where she can forgive Maya.  I know Maya was led by your parents, and ultimately abused by them as well, but that doesn\u2019t lessen what Tia suffered.  If you had gone through with having Tia\u2019s abuser move in you would have lost her, regardless of how much that abuser has changed, or how young they were when the abuse occurred.

We don't give them a pass and said they have no choice because they couldn't think like adults. The rush to dispower people and remove responsibility isn't helpful in these situations.

What I gather from this story is that for her parents she was always, first and foremost, just an instrument of abuse and when the main victim finally managed to escape, her parents could no longer use Maya that way and they had to start abusing her directly. Maya was raised to be an asshole and while the parents are mainly to blame for it, of course the sad truth still is that it worked and nothing she did can be erased away. But that is history.

And as another abused child who raised siblings I would probably come to the same conclusion as him. While I'm happy things worked out this way for Maya I know it's not necessarily safe to have an abused kid suddenly living on their own. Once most of the trauma catches up to them it could be terrifying being alone with no one there for them.

Now that he\u2019s helping Maya and initially tried to move Maya in and subject Tia to being around her abuser, it can of course feel like betrayal even though logically Maya was also a victim in need of help. Problem is that trauma and emotions are always going to make things messy. Tia isn\u2019t necessarily wrong for feeling this way and nor does she need to forgive someone who caused her such pain.

But dont punish your brother for wanting to be a freaking god brother, dont be selfish, stop putting yourself first all the time, dont make your brother choose betseen sisters, dont make your brother pay 2 apartments bcs YOU dont want to put up with maya, bcs you want the luxury to live comfortable, you nake your brother suffer for your sake. So sorry, this is not all about Tia, its about 3 siblings who grew up fucked up and OP is the one still trying and paying for all 3 of them, lus still parenting his sistersy especially his selfish one, tia. Horrible. I feel so bad for op.", "No way I'd ever make my brother pay rent on 2 places for my sake.\n\nI've had to live with my abusers as an adult, its called the alternative to homelessness.", "> Exactly, people here are eager to shit on Maya for being the golden child\n\nI've never really understood hatred of golden children, honestly. Sure, adult golden children can be grating or downright abusive, but it's not like golden children ask for the special treatment. That blame comes from the parent. If that's how they've been raised, why would they question it?", "I am saying that the OP wanting to bond with Maya is 100% normal and not some kind of terrible moral betrayal, and I am talking even more so, to be honest, about the rest of this subreddit who, unlike Tia, are not having a trauma response, and not trying to protect themselves.\n\nThey are just straight up joining the parents in pitting these kids against each other and deciding which one is the good child or the evil child. I'm seeing more contempt for Maya than the actual parents and I'm losing my mind.\n\nAn intrinsically unhinged take. All these kids are victims.  \n\n\n(I actually said from the get-go that Tia's feelings are entirely valid.)", "You called Maya\u2019s abuse towards Tia \u201cmistakes.\u201d That\u2019s downplaying it.", "That doesn\u2019t mean other people need to live with their abusers.", "Maya was groomed into that role and constantly reinforced on it. Her parents didn't teach her proper right or wrong.  But she still learned and has tried to apologize and make amends.", "All I want to know is how tf does everybody in these subs all afford so much therapy?", "OP, you are one heck of a guy, in the best way possible. You stepped up for both your little sisters, took criticism like a champ, and made it work even when it was hard as hell. It isn't a fairytale ending, sure, but so often situations like this in the real world don't even have a vaguely hopeful one. You're a badass.", "Honestly, it\u2019s hard to say that someone who is taking so much care of them is T A. It\u2019s not mayas fault she\u2019s that way, her parents made her that way. She was a child-they learn from their surroundings. It sounds like now that\u2019s she\u2019s growing up, she\u2019s realized the issues and working on making a change. Obviously that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Tia still suffered. Take it easy on yourself, it sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can to help them. You\u2019re a good brother.", "I really think people need to learn what abuse really is and the core dynamics. Abuse is about power and control. Abusers hold power in the relationship and abuse their victims to maintain their power and control. So if you\u2019re looking at a situation and wondering if someone is an abuser, ask yourself who has the power. This is why there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cmutual abuse\u201d. A child in an abusive home can absolutely be harmful and hurt others around them but a child cannot be an abuser (there\u2019s exceptions to this but 95% of the time they don\u2019t have the power needed to abuse someone). A child doesn\u2019t have power in a family dynamic in the way that a parent does. Parents are responsible for the dynamic they create in the family.\n\nI went through something similar in my family where my sister and I switched back and forth between being the black sheep and golden child. I blamed myself for years for not getting along with my sister until I realized that we were pitted against each other by our parents to keep us divided and unable to rely on each other to cope which absolutely made the trauma worse. \n\nMy sister and I no longer speak and the last time we spoke she said I was her abuser. It broke me to hear that because I obviously regret all of the mean things I said to her growing up. But at the end of the day she still has a strong relationship with my parents and she is still stuck in the cycle so it makes sense that she would call me an abuser and defend my parents. \n\nA lot of people see situations of abuse as black and white when they\u2019re almost always not. I really wish people could see the nuance in all of these situations and educate themselves more about abuse.", "That's not just Reddit, it's a lot of people. Because it's so much simpler when things are black and white, right and wrong, a good guy and a bad guy. This is a pitfall within the human condition, not just Reddit.", "Friendly reminder that these are the people who sometimes convince OPs to leave their significant others or go no contact with their parents.\n\nPeople give *far too much* credence to randoms who post online. You could be getting advice from 15 year olds here and you'd never know it.", "Which is so stupid because there are two very clear villains and those two are the parents. Not an abused kid.", "Sounds like the house I grew up in. My sibling took a few rounds of extreme verbal abuse from me after we hit adulthood; I literally screamed at them (and I am NOT a screamer), I called them every filthy name in the book, I damned them to every level of Hell, I told them I wished them dead. To their eternal credit they sat there and took it, more than once, just crying and apologizing and not yelling back. I am not proud of my scream-fests at my sibling, but it did release some poison, and over the years we've settled into a reasonable relationship. Not close, but not estranged either, and our kids have become close as cousins. \n\nToxic parents are the worst. They really are. They bring lives into the world, lives filled with promise and potential and dreams, and then they slice those dreams to ribbons. What might this world be, if all parents genuinely loved and wanted their children. I suppose we'll never know.", "Golden child can also be somewhat dependent on your viewpoint. My sister called me the Golden Child because I did well in school and would (very occaisionally) get praise. I thought she was the Golden Child because she could do all kinds of things that I would never be allowed to so and get away with them, and be a total brat. \n\nUltimately we both had shit to deal with and we continue to deal with even though we are both grown up", "Where are you getting that Tia is jealous of her abuser?", "Such as? Not wanting to live with her abuser isn\u2019t a black mark.", "OP, I wouldn't rule out an eventual rapprochement between Tia and Maya, no matter how (justifiably!) angry Tia is at this point in her life. You all (yes, even you) are still very, very young, and Tia is still far too close in time to the period in her life when her little sister was encouraged and rewarded for making Maya's life a living hell. She may yet come to understand what you have learned, namely, that Maya was created by the two sociopathic monsters who called themselves your parents (they weren't, other than biologically), and that as vicious as Maya may have been (and certainly was) to Tia, in fact Maya had very little agency over her behavior until she left home.  And she was still a child who wanted the approval of her parents. That your reprehensible parents rewarded Maya for mistreating ANYONE is beyond obscene. I'd say they're the true A. H. s in this story, but their behavior goes far beyond A. H. territory and descends into the realm of real sociopathology. It's a tragedy that you, Tia, and Maya had to live with these monsters, because that's what they are.\n\nThat Maya ultimately got about a two-year taste of what it means to be on the receiving end of such abuse has probably given her the gift and curse of understanding just what she was to Tia for a long, long time. I am in no way trying to minimize what Tia experienced or feels (I don't ever minimize the feelings of the household scapegoat), but the realization has to feel awful for Maya. Tia, of course, had the worst of it between the two of them; I suspect you had it just as badly, though.\n\nI know you have trusted therapists with whom you work, and that is the best thing you can be doing, of course. And I wouldn't want to give therapeutic advice, not being your therapist (or a therapist at all), but I am the parent of young adults AND the product of a family where one parent always played the kids against each other, essentially making us compete to be the favorite (I was more often scapegoat than even spray-paint gold, and rarely anything close to \"golden), so I am not without sympathy and perspective. And here's what I think, FWIW.\n\nGiven more time and space, Tia may be willing - on HER terms, in HER time, to open herself to some sort of relationship with Maya, perhaps after specifying precisely what reparations (for lack of a better word) she requires from Maya. Given her understanding of what Tia's life was like when Maya was emotionally and verbally eviscerating her, Maya may be willing to make the amends that Tia requires in order to re-establish some sort of relationship. Of course it may never happen; your ghastly parents may have done their demonic work too well and the rupture between your sisters may be permanent. \n\nBut in the fullness of time, and with the right supports and, perhaps, amends, Tia may some day be willing to accept some level of relationship with Maya. It may even be that the  most important thing they share, their love for you, will act as the bridge. We can all hope so.\n\nI wish you all the best. And, since I didn't read or give a judgement on any of this until just now, a clear NTA.", "Dude, you did nothing wrong, in my honest opinion Tia was (understandably so) selfish about all of this. Maya was 11 at the time you left. You are a better man then I killing yourself to accommodate everyone. All of you were victims don't forget that", "You were NOT HORRIBLE, NOT AT ALL! Being alittle bit selfish is reasonable. You are parenting 2 young adults. Yes, keep helping tia, but not ESPECIALLY her. YOU and MAYA also were abused in some way famn it. It makes me so angry and sad that you are so apologetic. You cant be there for them ALWAYS, they are grownups by now, and need to start acting like it too. You had to grow up very fast and parent 2 kids when you were srill akid yourself. You took care of both your sisters mentally and financially for too long. Dont burn yourself out. They need to figure their life out, and they cant be dependent on you the whole time. And that you cant always help them doesn't make you a bad brother at all. It makes you a human! I honestly find tia alittle bit selfish. Just bcs she has trauma doesn't make her a good or perfect  person, dont forget this. You all 3 didnt have ut easy, but you are only one who is giving anf giving and giving and honestly not really getting anything in return. Also feels lile tia may become an entitled person to you, she may belive that you MUST be there for her no matter what and that she should be your priority always.", "And I never said that Tia should give her another chance. But at the same time, that doesn't mean that Maya should go through life suffering just to satisfy what Tia wants.", "> Sure it may not have been as long or intense\n\nI'd argue she was abused just as long, just in a different way. Imagine going through young adulthood having been lavished with everything and the people who thought you could do no wrong taking a hard left turn into hating everything you stand for.\n\nOvercoddling is abuse too.", "I think a lot of commenters are projecting their trauma and/or are young people who have a lot of growing up to do", "It\u2019s stories like this that make me believe in the ability of people to change. I\u2019ve seen and heard about too many to have changed from being a terrible person into becoming a good person. \n\nI also believe in forgiveness. Forgiveness is, practically speaking, letting go of the anger and pain. It doesn\u2019t mean that what the person did to you is ok, nor does it require you to be stupid. It\u2019s letting go of the negativity. I hope that one day Tia can find her way to forgiveness.", "Not wanting to live with your abuser isn\u2019t selfish.", "No, he's not under obligation, but kids who go through abuse with siblings have an affinity to want to protect them. Yes, we can walk away and say \"not my monkeys, not my circus\" but it's hard to continue life knowing your siblings are going through what you escaped, even if they are complete and utter assholes. I had both of my brothers move in with me for a period of time to protect them. I didn't have to do that, but I, in good conscious, could not sit there and allow the abuse to continue if I was in a situation where I could protect them.\n\nAnd while Maya is not a good person, she is a victim of abuse herself. She grew up recognizing her behavior would be rewarded by her parents. As children we all do this. My brother realized the only way he'd get attention is if he acted badly, otherwise he was ignored. Well, he acted badly, very badly. Arrested by the cops, getting in fights, stealing, etc. But Maya realized that what she was doing was not good, and had a change of heart. That is something that is really REALLY hard to do when you're in an environment that fosters the other kind of behavior. I think it's commendable that Maya realizes what she was doing was wrong and wanted to change who she was and apologize.", "Tia isn\u2019t an asshole for not wanting to be around someone who was cruel to her when they were both children.", "Ok if you want to quote MLK then what is the presence of justice in this situation?", "I'm not saying that OP should have left Maya in her situation, but inviting Tia's abuser to come live with her is a major asshole move. I'm happy Maya is a better person now, but her redemption does not require her victim's participation. \n\nBoth things can be true. Maya needed help. OP inviting her to live with them was an asshole move. Both are true. Tia shouldn't have to suffer because Maya is in a bad spot and Maya shouldn't have to suffer in that bad spot.\n\nSeems like the solution that was reached was the only one where everyone gets the help they need and no one is getting hurt more.", "Welly probably bcs he is a forgiving person and wants to belive in people, and probably bcs he RAISED them when he was staying at home. He must feel like a parent who didnt consent to become one. He wasn't required to do any shit. Tia is acting very selfish. Wish she could care for op half as much as he car3s for her.", "Tia is still upset at the fact that op is just trying to help Maya. Plus in another comment op says \"I'm there brother that is my role. It's why I was punished when they misbehaved or something went wrong (unless it was Tia tormenting Maya of course)\". I think as an 11 year old girl I would feel justified at getting back at my tormentor, Especially with my parents encouraging me on and gaslighting me. All 3 of them are victims. Not just Tia. Now OPs financial burden includes an entirely new apartment. I understand her feelings but she prioritized her self over her brother and he's going to pay for it. Literally.", "Yes I absolutely agree there is a particular bond. Unfortunately I had the opposite experience than you. I\u2019m the younger one, moved in with a sibling, and they abused me in ways I couldn\u2019t imagine. \n\nA lot of people on the old and new post are bashing OP and maya but he\u2019s doing a really good job trying to help both of them, and she is doing a good job as well. And they are attending therapy. So bonus points for that lol \n\nA lot of people on this sun see things as black and white and refuse to accept the middle ground or growth. It\u2019s weird.", "Especially since people in their early twenties hold jobs that make them responsible for other people\u2019s well-being & safety.  \n\nApparently a 21 year old is old enough to drive a bus or a 24 year old can be a teacher, but they aren\u2019t capable of making adult choices & decisions.", "They also tend to think people are just born bad.  Thankfully, OP never thought this.", "Plus he specifically said he would have helped Tia find another place. Not just kicked her to the curb.", "I'd agree if Maya hadn't been a literal child who was a victim as well.", "Oh my god, I'm so sorry. That is absolutely horrible. And you're right. Obviously, there are one-offs, and as humans, not every situation is the same or repeatable. I'm so sorry, though, that your siblings continued the cycle of abuse instead of helping end it and offering you a safe haven.", "He's so busy putting out fires for others, he isn't able to focus on his own.", "Sure but she better start helping pay for her own place, to take the burden off her brother having to pay a full second set of rent and utilities. \n\nOr are you saying as an adult she should never have to pay her own way cuz she was abused?\n\nI don't blame my cousins or siblings for any of my abuse. They were experiencing it as well, just in another form. \n\nIt is incredibly selfish."]}
