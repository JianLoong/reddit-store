I didn't expect so many responses or the hate I got, though I now realise how badly I fucked up. While I still think how people wrote about Maya was disgusting and unfair, how I treated Tia was cruel and ignorant. I was trying to help everyone and be practical, but I neglected to properly consider the emotional side. While unintentional I was just ignoring Tia's pain and trauma.\n\nThe responses were a wake-up call and I realised I was just going to ruin everything. While it wasn't meant that way, it would just hurt Tia and ruin our relationship. I managed to convince some friends to let Maya stay with them and looked for a place. Currently, Tia still lives with me, while I found a cheap one-bedroom for Maya. It's been rough financially but I managed to get everything my sisters need, a few sacrifices don't matter compared to them. Maya needed help adjusting and learning to be independent so I did have to focus on her initially, and Tia absolutely hated me giving her any attention so it was extremely difficult at first. But it got a lot better as Maya adjusted and grew more independent and I could balance my time better. It's not perfect but we've gotten into a rhythm the best we can. \n\nMaya has grown a lot, and can mostly live by herself now, though I obviously still help. Therapy has really helped her and she's made a lot of friends at university. While she still wants Tia's forgiveness, she's accepted it's not in her control and to focus on living her life and improving herself. I'm really happy she's free of our parents' influence, she's nothing like she used to be. Though I do wish I had tried harder when she was younger, rather than giving up.\n\nTia isn't completely happy, I don't think she'll ever forgive Maya. I've done my best to make it clear I love her, and Maya isn't my favourite but it's been hard. We get joint therapy that helps a lot, but she still wishes it was just us. Still she's finally able to understand that helping Maya isn't rejecting her. I'm so thankful and lucky Tia could forgive me, she means the world to me. I never intended to hurt her, though I clearly completely fucked up my approach. We basically just avoid the Maya situation, and have managed to get back to normal. She's such a strong woman, I'm honestly so proud of her and so ashamed of how short-sighted I was.\n\nAs selfish as it is, a part of me will always wish Tia could forgive her. But I know that's impossible and selfish. I don't think Tia will ever fully accept that Maya is a part of my life. The most I'll get is Tia and Maya being in one building for my wedding, but honestly that's enough for me. They're both victims of our parents, so I'm just glad they can both be happy and free. While it's not a fairy-tale ending, everything is going well. I'm glad I posted and was able to fix my horrible mistake.", "created_utc": 1677755233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g03tn/update_aita_choosing_the_golden_child_over_my/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tzupq6/aita_choosing_the_golden_child_over_my_other/)", "I'm glad you were able to heed the wake-up call and see the situation more clearly.\n\nI'm glad you are all in therapy.

Good job trying to support all of the victims of your parents in the best way you can.", "I\u2019m glad things are getting better.\n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself - you made a mistake but acknowledged it and fixed it. \n\nIt\u2019s also very common for victims of trauma to want all the survivors to be a happy family once the trauma is not longer actively happening. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that feeling as long as you recognize that emotion for what it is. It sounds like your therapist is helping you do that.\n\nYou\u2019ve taken on a huge responsibility of caring for your siblings and saving them from a toxic environment. That burden should have never been yours in the first place. You are also a victim.\n\nAnd yet you\u2019ve managed to get yourself and your siblings in a position where it\u2019s possible to lead happy and healthy lives. \n\nYou\u2019ve updated AITA with the happiest ending possible. Give yourself some credit and walk away from the post.", "Don\u2019t listen to all the bullshit, fuckin\u2019 Reddit loves a story with a bad guy they can hate and a victim they can sympathise with. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing and sacrificing for your sisters is beyond admirable. You\u2019re a good person and the world needs more people like you. \n\nI hope you too can find your peace some day.", "r/NotTheAssholeAnymore\n\nthis is a really good turnaround OP! good job!", "I'm gonna be honest, you're still fucking up. The fact that you want Tia to forgiv Maya shows that you truly don't understand the trauma she's gone though and are still placing your own selfish desires for the absence of tension over her need for justice and peace.", "Honestly this is about as positive a result that could be hoped for, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found a way to help both of your sisters.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you stopped before you saw the error of your ways before you kicked Tia out. Hopefully you can repair your relationship with her.\n\nBut how the comments here can sit and judge you for trying to do your best in a crappy situation, step up, and try to help two girls who were emotionally abused is disgusting. Honestly, good luck with everything and I think what you\u2019re doing is amazing.", "Some people here need to breathe a little and stop looking for a monstrous villain to froth at.  \n\n\nMaya was a literal child during the abusive dynamic that triggered all this, the youngest of the three, and while Tia's trauma and pain are incredibly valid, a child of abusive and neglectful parents who *knows* she is on thin fucking ice and needs to be constantly complicit to all this or else they will turn on *her... IS ALSO A VICTIM, GUYS. All three of them were victims of a very toxic, abusive parenting dynamic.*  \n\n\nAnd yes, Tia is within her right to never want to forgive her. And to want nothing to do with her.  \n\n\nTeam Tia. I hope her life goes as best as a life can go.  \n\n\nBut the brother wishing all three of them could find some kind of peace isn't being a dick. He didn't push. He didn't cross anyone's boundaries. He's just having some wishful thoughts. Are we calling the thought police now?  \n\n\nReddit's moral viciousness, constantly trying to whip everyone down and projecting their own traumas, envies, hurts and internalized biases, is something else. Y'all get some sadistic pleasure from this and you need to invest in some nuance.", "Seems like you\u2019re doing the best you can in the situation.  And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to help both of them- a lot of people disregard that the golden child goes through trauma too in an abusive household.  As evidenced by this comment section.  You\u2019ve found way to achieve equilibrium, and you all have therapy support.  Good work, big brother.  There will undoubtably be more challenges ahead but I think you\u2019re on the right path.", "The irony of the bulk of the posters here implying you're unempathetic for caring about both sisters while unilaterally considering Maya the devil in this situation is honestly outstanding.\n\nThe situation isn't perfect and it sucks for all parties but it's one that tries to find the best outcome for all. I don't understand the vitriol here honestly. The posters here reek of selfishness and lack of empathy.", "I think you did great! As someone who\u2019s married to someone who\u2019s currently going through similar, although not quite as bad, problems, I completely understand what you did. What people here fail to understand is that both kids were abused, and you have to balance that. Even if one was a golden child, that is still abuse and it fucks them up big time, same as it fucks up the other kids that aren\u2019t the golden child. They are kids and they deserve a second chance. People here expect kids to have wisdom above their ages and identify their own bad behavior, it seems like they were never kids themselves.", "God I still feel so desperately sorry for Tia. \n\nI know this is just rehashing but I still can't believe how close you were to moving her out of the only safe home she's ever known in favour of her bully. And it took hundreds of people to help you see this. Plus can't believe Maya didn't see the problem with her moving in at the expense of Tia. Big empathy problem in this family.\n\nI'm glad you are all getting therapy as empathy can be taught somewhat and sounds like it was necessary for everyone apart from Tia. \n\nGood luck to her in moving on and finding a found family and partner who will care about her.", "I would consider this a positive update. Family dynamics can be very difficult and delicate. I think what a lot of commenters overlook is that Maya was 19 and 2 years younger than Tia at the time of reaching out to OP. When you left Tia was older and easier to connect with being 13 versus an 11 year old. Maya was 16 when Tia moved in with You and  she then became the only person your parents could unleash on or make do possible chores to \u2018enjoy themselves\u2019.  \nI award Maya for all the self reflection she accomplished before reaching out at 19 with possibly no therapy. There is no justification for how Maya treated Tia but all we can do as Humans is look at our past and improve from there. Maya has done that and overcome so much in the short period of a year to overcome her self guilt/hate for how she was in her youth and as a brother or another sibling it is commendable. There are lot of posts on this thread that never reach that closure-ish within siblings. Tia is young at 21/22 and forgiveness can take time being hurt so deeply and having a comparable of this is what my brother has done for me versus what my sister has done. Tia may just take time to come around or may not but all Maya can do is send a birthday card in the mail or write a letter to Tia every once in a while. Sometimes a text or call isn\u2019t as personal. Not advice or if this will work with what Maya has done to Tia but sometimes knowing that even if Tia doesn\u2019t want anything to do with Maya, it does not mean that Tia is not on Maya\u2019s mind, if that makes sense. I am glad that you worked things out to where you can have both of your sisters in your life that I know you care deeply for. Being an older sibling put in a position to support younger siblings even later in life can be difficult. \n\nI wish you three the best in all your futures.", "this is so sad for Tia. i hope she heals and puts an incredible amount of distance between you two. \n\ndiscuss with your therapist why you haven't accepted Tia's boundary and STILL want her to forgive maya.", "I\u2019m proud of you. Especially at having the selfish thought but realizing it\u2019s too much to ask. Continue helping your sisters, especially Tia. From one oldest sibling to the other, you\u2019re doing a good job but focus on yourself as well, if you break down then you can\u2019t be there for them.", "This maya acts like a bad guy who was sorry he was caught and now plays the victim part. Tia is right to stay away from her.", "It\u2019s amazing how all the people here giving OP crap don\u2019t see that maya was a victim too of abusive parenting. People can change especially when they suffer from the same trauma themselves and realize how they were raised really fucked them up. She\u2019s making amends. By being on her own, cut parents off, apologizing and therapy. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be casted as a villain for the rest of her life for her acts as a child. Tia doesn\u2019t have to forgive either. Maya could very well be a trigger to her past. In her eyes Maya=parents. OP is older he sees and understands that Maya was a victim. He also didn\u2019t suffer like Tia did at the hands of Maya. So his experience would be different. So not moving her in was a GOOD move. \n\nIt\u2019s a shitty situation. But OP is doing a good thing for a sister who was abused herself. He\u2019s a good person and doesn\u2019t deserve the hate. Those parents CREATED this situation.", "OP, you\u2019re doing an extraordinary job In impossible circumstances. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s all anyone can ask. \n\nMy one piece of advice: stop feeding the trolls. You don\u2019t need to justify yourself to anyone. \n\nRest easy. You\u2019re doing enough.", "You're trying your best.  At 26, you're trying to remove the distorted lens that you were taught to have by your parents, just as much as Tia and Maya are trying to figure out who they are apart from your toxic parents and the environment they created.  And frankly, for someone who was gaslighted for so many years, you're doing a hell of a job.\n\n  \nThere are a LOT of people on reddit and in this sub who love to be vindicative and judgemental, perhaps because they don't feel like they don't have control over their own lives and it is their way of pushing back against their own personal issues they see playing out in this sub.   \n\n\nKeep going to therapy.   Keep engaging with everyone.  It will take time, but you will heal and be strong and be a source of inspiration to your sisters and those around you.", "NTA - seems like Tia is asking you to choose sides. You did choose - grace, compassion, and forgiveness. I understand why Tia would want you to choose her. She needs an advocate, and you were her savior. In her still developing mind, you were now going to save her abuser. I can absolutely appreciate her perspective. But when removed from an abusive environment AND received therapy to help the individuals grow and heal, people do change for the better. I love your humanity and compassion. You did right by Tia - showing her that even sinners need saving. \n\nYou made a mistake when you initially tried to help Maya. But, you found a great work-around. I applaud your commitment to your sisters. IMO, I think Tia needs to feel like she is your golden-sister. She has a lot of healing to get through. But without forgiveness, she will never find that peace. Keep in mind, forgiveness does not mean forgetting. It also does not include having a relationship with Maya. It's simply letting go of the anger so that she can move forward.", "I hope tia has a wonderful life and is successful in all her endeavours. As for maya I hope karma come bk around because she made a person's childhood shit because she joined her parents to bully her. She only changed her mind when the nastiness of her parents turned on HER. She says it's because she was jealous of your relationship with tia. So at 2yrs older she wanted tia to be completely alone. You still talk about maya as a great person but not so much about tia. Would she have been apologetic to tia if her parents didn't turn on her. Remember she became an adult before she got in touch.\n\nYes you are being selfish and still don't fully get the trauma these people did to tia as a little girl. She wasn't safe in her home she was bullied and hated for existing. No wonder she insecure about her home when you wanted to move her abuser in. You pay for everything for maya and tia pays rent. So still favourites.", "I think you should give up the wish of making up between the two. I know you mean well and all, but for as long as you hold on to that wish, your will act unintentionally and unconsciously to that wish. You will one day hurt your sisters because of one wrong action. Just give up on that, let everyone go separate way and heal.", "You keep painting Maya as some unknowing tool that your parents used to abuse Tia. Maya was 16 when Tia left. Old enough to know that cruelty is wrong. People keep downplaying psychological abuse because it isn\u2019t visually visible. Think of it as if it was physical. Every day Maya flailed the skin from Tia. Every day she bled and hurt while being told to suck it up. And while she hurt, Maya stood there grinning and enjoying her pain. That is who Tia sees every time she thinks of Maya. The grinning monster who enjoyed inflicting pain. And that is who you wish she would forgive. I wouldn\u2019t bet on ever getting them in the same room together. Not even for your wedding.\n\nThankfully Maya have realized the error of her upbringing and is taking steps to better herself. It will take years of hard work to remove 16 years of indoctrination. She can absolutely do it, and I think she already is well on her way. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she sometimes relapses in stressed situations. No one can do a complete 180 like that. It\u2019s a process and takes work.", "I think it might be helpful for you to understand/read up on how family systems work. By getting the scapegoat (Tia) and the rescuer (yourself) out of the house, the system broke apart. Which is why Maya didn't want to stay there anymore. The broken system always needs a scapegoat to project their negtive feelings on, which didn't work anymore with Tia out. And without you trying to fix things between the persecutors/abusers, the system likely collapsed.\n\nThough that doesn't mean that Maya magically changed as a person (golden child, entitled, abusive). She just isn't in a system anymore where she can live her learned role.\n\nYou think that because you don't see Maya as the entitled brat that she was anymore that she's changed, but it is more than likely that she will slip back into her role if Tia ever decided that she want's to \"make up\" with her sister. She'll be back to put her down again in no time.\n\nYou might not be consciously aware of it, but you want the system to go back to what it was. You are still very much the codependent/rescuer trying to fix things, Tia will be the scapeoat (again), and Maya will be the persecutor (again). \n\nDon't let it happen. Let the system stay broken. Stop fixing things. Every member of your family needs to learn to get out of their roles.", "Tia is definitely the Asshole here, your trying to help them both and she's just not supporting that.", "INFO: \n\nWhat, if anything, have you done as an apology to Tia for your colossal fuck-up? And your fuck-up was on the scale of giving a kid a 30 day eviction notice on their 18th birthday, saying \"my house, my rules, suck it up, get over it, put on your grown-up pants, and piss off\", and then turning your back on them. \n\nI ask because you make no mention of any kind of apology or anything. Just of getting Maya out of there.", "I feel so bad for Tia. I hope she can eventually move out and never look back. She has suffered too much from this family, with this situation included. Poor girl.", "I understand that you did your best but no amount of reasonings and explanations will change the fact that you are footing the bill for your sister's abuser. Maya can change and redeem herself as much as she wants, but that will never undo the psychological scars SHE inflicted onto somebody. She will always be Tia's abuser. She will always be the person who inflicted years of trauma onto her. The fact that she was a victim too doesn't erase the fact that she was also an abuser. You can claim you love your sister all you want, but at the end of the day you still went above and beyond to protect her abuser and nearly displaced her and kicked her out to make room for the person who inflicted years of damage onto her. Karma bit Maya in the ass, but Tia is the one who will always have to live with the knowledge that the one person she trusted will always be protecting the person she needed protection and peace from :(", "Yikes, clearly you don\u2019t get it. This could still end with Tia going no contact. You still make her abuser a priority. I get Maya was a kid, but it sounds like the damage she did (along with your parents) was extensive. You acknowledge that she isn\u2019t happy and you can\u2019t about the Maya situation forever. Quite honestly at some point you will probably have to make a choice.", "Color me confused as to why it is the OP's job to house/financially support either adult sister. He is the brother, not the parent.", "For what it's worth, OP, I don't think you were choosing Maya \"over\" Tia. Maya was a child when all of this went down, and she didn't realize how much she was being manipulated. As my GC sister experienced when she became an adult, GC status is always conditional when kids are the product of narcissists. Maya was only acting as an agent of your parents because that's how they taught her to be.\n\nThe fact that Maya is trying to change speaks volumes. I also hope that Tia can learn to forgive her, knowing that your parents were really the ones at fault.", "I can\u2019t really believe anyone shamed you for this!  Maya was a CHILD. Not saying all actions are excused but you really can\u2019t judge her so harshly knowing her age and abuse from parents that was going on.", "Definitely stop trying to get Maya to forgive Tia, they need to work that out by themselves, and I'm looking for the part where Maya tries to apologize and make amends with Tia. Saying it doesn't make it true, needs to demonstrates being considerate for her on her terms consistently.\n\nIt's great you are helping your sisters get healthy feet on the ground but reading these I can't help but feel you are giving Maya preference because she states she's willing to reconcile even though I see that as an unfair perspective.\n\nYou're entitled to an agenda of your own, just keep in mind that's not being magnanimous. \n\nGood luck and I hope you can all move past it and forgive. I adore my sisters and it would tear at me too if they didn't get along.", "Poor Tia", "Oh yeah thanks. Forgot to do that!", "Thank you, it definitely helped. If it wasn't for that I would have lost Tia I think. \n\nThe therapy really has helped. Maya and Tia have improved so much from back at our parents. And our therapist helped us accept and understand each other's feelings on this. I'm so glad Tia was willing to let me apologize and try to fix it, and especially get that counselling with me.\n\nWe actually still go every two weeks. Even if the Maya issues are sorted it still helpful with everything else and our parents", "I bet the second she moves away he moves Maya right into the room she just left and then he'll be back here asking why Tia won't talk to him anymore.", "She's doing really well at uni so I'm certain she'll be able to. I'll support whatever choice she makes, though when she finally gets her own place I will definitely miss her. She's a lot smarter than me so she'll definitely go far whatever she chooses", "Jesus Christ this man is getting raked over the coals for trying to do best for his two sisters when he himself is a youngster. He says he wishes the sisters could forgive each other which is obvious to any sane person, never said he was forcing them too.", "Thank you for this comment. obviously tia is the victim here, but mayas behavious was the product of poor upbringing by their parents. the subreddit fails to acknowledge that people are able to grow and evolve and move past mistakes that were made. its as if people think once the bad guy, always the bad guy. maya was a child, she hadnt/ and probably still hasnt fully developed.  \n\ni applaud OP for wanting peace with his two sisters and find critism of him quite unfair.", "I'm glad someone else said it, I thought I was going crazy for a bit. OP is clearly doing his best and may have made a few missteps in handling it, but obviously cares about both of his sisters which isn't a bad thing. It's a sad situation.", "It's crazy I had to scroll so long for this take. OP's clearly trying to be a good person and help *everyone* but this thread is just shitting on him. All three of the children were abused, but no one is taking that into consideration.\n\nOP should be commended for all he's done to get **both** of them out of that situation. Rather than dumped on by reddit.", "That's not what I meant.\n\nI didn't mean she should or that I'm trying to make it happen. It's like how I'll always wish our parents loved us, even though I know it'll never happen.\n\nI'm not putting this first. Our therapist has helped us a lot. She thinks where we are is healthy, even if not perfect\n\nA crush on someone you married doesn't mean you actually want to commit adultery or will act on it. The feelings themselves aren't the issue. \n\nAs our therapist said, it's fine for me to want a loving family, as long as I can accept Tia feelings and boundaries. Which I am", "He is also paying for the apartment or did I read that wrong?", "And he is paying for Maya\u2019s apartment or did I read that wrong?  It seems like Maya is still being spoiled.", "Agreed! OP sounds like a nice guy who is truely trying his best in a terribly difficult situation and he's getting so much hate for it! Some of these comments are insane to me!", "I know. I majorly fucked up. I was so focussed on practicality I ignored her feelings. It wasn't that I lack empathy, I just got caught up in wanting to end our parents control and abuse. Tia means the absolute world to me. The only reason I could make such a horrible mistake was because I thought she could still understand. I didn't realise I would lose her.\n\nEither way I'm so proud of her. She's an amazingly strong woman. Certainly smarter than me (admittedly not hard). She's still not interested in dating, but I know I'll really miss her when she does finally move out.", "Well... Tia was willing to let her sister be abused by their parents... \n\nMaya might have been the golden child and bullied Tia but it is clear that it was a surviving mechanism... I'm not gonna blame a child.for.wanting to survive... \n\nHe had to get Maya out of there! You talk about lacking empathy... But where is yours for Maya and OP? They are victims as well!", "I think it may not have been worded clearly. I HAVE accepted her boundary.\n\nI meant it in the same way as I wish our parents loved us and didn't abuse us. Our therapist HAS gone over this with us, repeatedly. It's thanks to her we can properly understand each other here.", "Thank you. Those comments hurt a lot but it made me realise how horrible I was being. I'm definitely going to be there for them all. I love my sister more than anything (don't tell my partner haha).\n\nThough she does tell me that too. But I only have so much money. And ultimately those two are more important than me.", "She was a child who\u2019s parents abused her and brainwashed her against her siblings\u2026she was a victim of her parents as well. It\u2019s similar to parental alienation. Which is abusive to the child.", "I understand she was wrong as a child. But this isn't some manipulative plot. She's not a monster.\n\nBoth of them were victims. And Tia is right to stay away if that's what she needs. But Maya isn't that same girl desperate for our parents love. She's not lying. She's open about her mistakes, and her growth is real. Her therapist isn't just for show.", "'karma'? None of us deserves our parents. If karma existed all of us deserve better.\n\nBut even assume you're right, it did get Maya. She's been punished for what she did. Her sister will always hate her. She lost her brother for years. She has been abused by our parents from day one. \n\nShe didn't want Tia to leave. That was my fuck up. And she was abused the whole time, the golden child is a victim too. Just because she needed time to realise her doesn't mean she deserves to be scorned for life.\n\nAnd it's not favourite. Tia lived with me for free until she CHOSE to contribute. I didn't make her. And even now I'm paying for all their therapies, and most necessities.", "It's not that kind of wish. I wish I had good parents, but I'm hardly suddenly treating them better than my sister.", "I'm honestly glad you've never been in the situation to understand this. But she was taught to act that way. It was the only way to get our parents love. The one thing children INSTINCTIVELY crave. She didn't know better because she was rewarded for that behaviour. Me or Tia saying no didn't work when our parent manipulated her into believing it. \n\nShe is taking the work. She's in therapy, she's doing everything she can to move on and improve. She was the fucking victim as well. Even our therapist has tried to explain it similarly.", "That's not what's happening. She literally sees two (solo and joint with me) therapists that can attest that your full of shit about her. I don't know why everyone is so cynical. She has matured and realised she's wrong.\n\nIf anything is codependent it's Tia and me, with how she's struggling with my engagement.", "I think you have been living your whole life sheltered and have never been hurt or abused. Good for you, but you will never understand people who were and are abused. If that's so, please keep silent because you are talking like an asshole here.", "I think you did great! As someone who\u2019s married to someone who\u2019s currently going through similar, although not quite as bad, problems, I completely understand what you did. What people here fail to understand is that both kids were abused, and you have to balance that. Even if one was a golden child, that is still abuse and it fucks them up big time, same as it fucks up the other kids that aren\u2019t the golden child. They are kids and they deserve a second chance. People here expect kids to have wisdom above their ages and identify their own bad behavior, it seems like they were never kids themselves.", "Or maybe Tia will realise her brother who let her moves with him at 23 and is getting them all therapy is someone to keep in her life.", "You may wanna touch base with Tia, because this sounds like you\u2019re about to never hear from her again unless you do something different.", "And I'm sure she will go far far away as soon as she is able...", "Wow. A lot of people in here ready to cast judgment on all of these children and not pointing fingers at the adults. You moved out when you were 18 from an abusive family situation. That's not failure. That's survival. You did what you could for your sister Tia and you've honestly gone above and beyond what you could reasonably expect to do, but you are not a parent. You're a brother, and at the end of the day only four years older than Tia. You have essentially been forced to step in and be a parent to both of these girls, who are honestly now adults. And Tia is about as old as you were when you took her in and took over as her single parent and entire support network.\n\nMeanwhile, people want you to completely cut out someone who was also abused, and who is going through a difficult growing up process where she comes to terms with some of her own shitty behavior as a child. But at the same time, SHE WAS A CHILD. And I'm sorry, on the spectrum of things where children are also roving in gangs and beating people to death and stealing cars, being a brat is really not the worst thing to be.\n\nYeah, support Tia. If she forgives Maya, it must be on her own time and her own schedule. And I'll be honest with you: she may need to move entirely across the country and stand on her own feet for a while before she's ready to think about something like that. That's what it took for me.\n\nBut you as their brother don't need to pick sides here. Except against your abusive family, who put you in this shitty situation where you don't get to be a young adult because you're so busy processing the trauma of your sisters and trying to navigate their feelings.\n\nYou are also a victim here.", "I disagree with other people in this thread. I think you\u2019re doing your level best in a hard situation, and supporting people who clearly have both undergone trauma. No one\u2019s behaviour is perfect. And it\u2019s totally acceptable for you to wish they got on, as long as you don\u2019t force the issue with either of them. Good for you - it sounds like you\u2019re a considerate person who has made extensive sacrifices. It\u2019s odd that people aren\u2019t registering that.", "This is a mature point of view and at the risk of sounding ridiculous since I don\u2019t know you, I\u2019m so proud of you for coming so far. Keeping working at it, love one your sisters, let therapy help, and work at loving life. You sound like you\u2019re gonna make it. This is a super positive update.", "That is exactly what you meant, because that is exactly the situation you're in now. You don't have peace, you simply have the absence of tension. Your ongoing actions are continuing to hurt Tia, and the only reason your relationship survives is because *she* is doing the heavy lifting of constantly putting her own feelings to the side for *your* benefit. \n\nDoes she even have own individual counselor, or does she just get to see yours with you?", "As a psychologist who specializes in emotional/psychological trauma (and as someone who has CPTSD from their own psychological trauma) - you\u2019re  absolutely right. It\u2019s fine to *want* forgiveness, as long as you accept it\u2019s not your decision. Which it sounds like you have. \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to feel *however* you want and those feelings are valid. What people fail to understand is that feelings and actions are NOT the same thing. So ignore everyone who is acting like you\u2019re the devil for wanting forgiveness. As long as you\u2019re not pushing it, you\u2019re good. \n\nAlso just wanted to say that you don\u2019t deserve the hate you\u2019re getting. Neither does the current Maya, because people *can* change - my entire profession is literally based on that fact. Anyone who does not understand that, is not someone you need to waste your time worrying about. So again, ignore everyone attacking you and Maya - they\u2019re speaking from a place of emotion without understanding how psychological growth actually occurs. \n\nKeep on supporting your sisters.

To me it looks like she hated that Tia had a safe place and wanted to ruin that too for her by making you feel guilty for \"abandoning\" her. And the \"she didn't want to tell me how bad it was with our parents, i had to draw it out of her\" thing.... honey, i understand you're a man, but trust me, she wanted you to draw it out of her. It was more effective than telling you dirrectly. And now she plays the \"it's okay if she doesn't want to forgive me and holds a grudge, i would focus on myself and act like the offended part\" plot. Give it a few weeks and you'll see how she starts with the passive aggressive comments about Tia not forgiving her. \n\nSeriously, how can you fall for all that?", "I still stand by my advice, please stop wishing for Tia to forgive Maya. You may say you will never act om that wish, but one wrong action, or one frustrating moment that you unconsciously follow the **wish** you are holding, you will hurt Tia very very badly, and there will be hardly anyway to come back from it.\n\nI have experienced that, I witnessed people misspoke, and the results were\u2026 unfortunate. I was the one who on both sides. Just give you some perspectives. My then-good friend and I had a very bad and damaging argument/discord, we talked, and the last things he said to me were:\n\n> My friend: \"For everyone's benefits you had to take the short end, although you did nothing wrong.\"\n\n> Me: \"Then I want to ask, if you were me, and I were you, would you stay friend with me if I treated you like you did to me?\"\n\n> My friend: \"No, I wouldn't.\"\n\nThat was the last time we talked. And I believe he didn't mean to say so, but he said it out because, like you, he had a wish to make everyone happy at the expense of mine. He misspoke that, because he unconsciously followed that, and mistreat me badly. Well, we are no longer friend, I can never forgive him for that.\n\nMaybe you feel like you will never do a bad thing to Tia, but one slip and you will. And you defend your wish of making the two sisters making up so vehemently I can see. \"It is harmless, I won't act on it.\" You said that in every comment who point it out. As long as you still defend you and your selfish wish, I can see that you sooner or later will hurt Tia.\n\nI stand by my advice. Your wish is selfish and it's really bad to hold on to it. For Tia, and maybe for Maya, give up on that.", "Oh I do understand. She tortured her sister for her parents approval and yes she is a victim too. And it\u2019s still conditioning. And it\u2019s still something she was trained to do for 16 years. It is ingrained in her. To undo all of that takes years. You act as if she is suddenly good and incapable of hurting anyone ever again. She is good in the fact that she recognizes the hurt she has done, and that is doing all she can to undo the abuse your parents did to all of you (you included). \n\nBut it will take more time and work. She has been conditioned to act a certain way in certain situations, and has to be reprogrammed. Like an alcoholic, she will have relapses until she beats the abuse.\n\nOh, and you are again dismissing the part she took in Tia\u2019s pain.", "It's so strange how everything you say about Maya is positive, yet every comment about Tia is framed in how she is having problems or how you wish she would behave differently.\n\nAlmost like Maya can do no wrong and all blame for the situation gets shifted to Tia...", "You said yourself that Tia was been severely abused by Maya. The fact that you still want them to make up (for who exactly? Surely not for Tia's sake. Because she probably has PTSD from all the abuse) tells me a different story of what is going on here.\n\nIt should trouble you that somebody would do this to their own sibling. But you seem pretty fond of Maya, and less so of Tia. Again, that makes me question the validity of what you say. You shouldn't be on Maya's side here OR wish for them to make up. Even if she was a completely changed person, that doesn't undo years of being abused.", "We literally live together and have fortnightly joint therapy together. I know how she's feeling. Maya is not an issue in her mind anymore, our therapy has helped us get past it.", "I wish Reddit still did free awards because you deserve one for this comment.

I\u2019m convinced the majority of this sub is made up of teenagers who don\u2019t understand any kind of nuance or complicated family dynamic.", "Thank you. I honestly hate how many people are hating on Maya. And seem to think helping her at all is wrong. And like I repeatedly said I KNOW she'll never forgive her. I know it's impossible. According to our therapist it's fine to want it, as long as I can accept Tia's decision and never push it. Which I've done.\n\nI wish people could understand Maya. Or even our therapists' advice. It's so frustrating when I'm following their advice yet people act like I'm abusing Tia again. I fucked up but one fuck up doesn't define everything.\n\nI appreciate your words.

While it's different than my sister, it wasn't great for me.", "People really don\u2019t understand that the environment that caused Tia and Maya and OP grew up in was wholly abusive. \n\nIt\u2019s considered abuse for one parent to train a child to hate the other parent, and that\u2019s very similar to creating an environment where one kid hates and taunts the others. \n\nAll 3 were victims of the parents and I really hope they are able to come together in forgiveness and understanding eventually.", "People are being so harsh to Maya!! It almost feels like they wanted him to leave her there!!", "Both Maya and Tia have individual therapist weekly. I also have joint therapy with both (separately) every two weeks. \n\nYou are accusing Maya of shit that is disgusting and wrong. She isn't that same child. I love Tia, I was stupid and fucked up but I never want to hurt her. I've sacrificed so much for those two. Don't you dare act like I do nothing for her. Our fucking therapist is able to understand this yet you magically know better?", "Ah thanks.", "No, he fucked up.", "Like I said I don't mean I actively want it or will try to get it. I understand completely why she doesn't want to. You know, the goal of our joint therapy. \n\nBut have you never wished things could be different? Il always wish my parents were better, but fuck knows I'm not trying make it happen. Same with this", "I get where you're coming from, but no one knows what they all individually went through. My parents messed up any core relationships I may have had with my siblings during our childhood and made us view each other as competition/adversaries. It's only now in adulthood that we are coming to understand what happened to us and why we felt such a way towards each other, why we were willing to hurt each other as much as we did. These kids are still a little fresh out of their trauma, with their brother honestly trying to heal his own trauma. He's not a parent, he's a sibling. He can wish for loving bonds between his family and still understand that its not (currently, or may not ever be) possible. Doesn't mean he's stomping on his sister's boundaries, just that he's expressing an old hurt that will probably hurt forever. It's entirely normal, and actually healthy for him to express. Traumatic family dynamics are a trip and a half, especially for the children that still need healing. At least they're all in therapy for it.\n\nLet me repeat: this poor guy is still healing himself. He's not going to say the right things or do the right things 100% of the time because he is still healing, himself. This is still a very fragile wound all these kids are dealing with. Let's not dogpile onto a man who's just trying to do his best by his little sisters while still recovering from their parents.\n\nOp, you're trying so hard, and I see it. From one traumatized and isolated child to another, keep at it. You're doing amazing, sweetie.", "If you truly care for someone you want them to have healing and peace. Strong boundaries are great, and you don't have to like everyone, but carrying hate and resentment around is a huge, corrosive burden.

Thanks for your concern though.", "You don't fucking know her. And you don't know how any of this happened. \n\nShe didn't just change and go 'oh well I'll focus on myself'. That was months of therapy working on her guilt and self-hate. You look at the scars on her arms and tell me she doesn't regret what she did. \n\nIt's been MONTHS and she hasn't done ANYTHING to hurt Tia. She's following her therapists advice, the same as Tia.\n\nEdit.\n\nI can't respond to the commentor so I'll put it here.\n\nTia didn't know. I didn't exactly tell her it meant Tia would go. She just knew that I'd told her to move in with me, that I would help her.", "I'm literally getting therapist advice for my approaches to Tia and Maya. I'm not just making rash decisions. Our therapist has explained and focused on my wish and how to deal with it healthily. Denying it wasn't her advice", "Then what should I have done?\n\nTold her to fuck off and take the abuse?\n\nAll of you bitching about me helping Maya have no solutions. Like I literally followed the advice I was given last post, yet it's not enough.", "That's literal bullshit. My literal first comment on this post was praising Tia.\n\nBringing up this issue was Tia was relevant. Maya is more independent than her, that's not praise, that's the actual situation. Maya was wrong AS AN ABUSED CHILD. \n\nTia is a victim and obviously has issues from it, we all do. But I've repeatedly said how amazing and strong she is. Stop misrepresenting everything", "As our therapist said, it's fine for me to want a loving family, as long as I respected Tia boundaries and feelings. A part of me will always want my sister to be close, just as I'll always want parents who don't abuse us. But that's not the part of me making decisions.

She shouldn't forgive you for considering that and needing a bunch of strangers on the Internet to intervene to stop you either. I hope she moves out on her own and can escape you constantly trying to make her forgive her bully.", "It almost feels like they're saying that Maya has said \"forgive me!\" to get out of a bad situation and be treated like the Golden One again, but has never said the words, \"I'm sorry.\" \nMaya wants forgiveness but has she actually apologized for what she has done? There really is a difference.", "Does Tia get to see a therapist that's seperate from yours? Not just seperate appointments, but a totally seperate therapist that's in her corner, and her corner alone?\n\n\nI'm not accusing Maya of anything at all, I haven't even said anything about her. \n\nBut the fact that you jump to defend her so viciously when she *hasn't even been mentioned* shows your true colors. \n\nYour parents aren't the only ones with a golden child.", "> You are accusing Maya of shit that is disgusting and wrong. She isn't that same child.\n\n\nThat's the mentality you have to work on - she grew up, natured, tasted her own medicine once you guys were gone... but she still the same person, all the abuse Tia suffered was by her hand. Is nice that you recognize how Maya improved, but you're mentally looking at it like teenage Maya and current Maya are different people and that obviously bleeds on how you're with Tia.\n\n\nMaya is an abuse victim *and* an abuser, recognize one and treat the other like \"past\" is precisely why you keep hurting Tia even with zero intentions of doing so. Maya and Tia have completely different types of trauma and that affects how they study, work, make friends, trust people, etc. Your parents messed Maya up, but the trio did bigger damage to Tia so yes forgive the youngest but please don't forget for Tia's sake.", "When I wish that things are different in an abuse situation, I wish that the abuser had never abused my loved one, not that my loved one would forgive the abuser.", "I\u2019m surprised with how everyone is judging him still. It\u2019s normal to wish things were different, but he seems to be respecting that they won\u2019t be.", "Just because they're doing some good, doesn't mean they're doing enough.

All 3 of you were the victims. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s harder for you to deal with it and crave this peace between them.\n\nAny sort of child abuse (psychological or physical) differs between siblings. The risk of victimization is lower when a child has more siblings overall, and even lower when those are older siblings. As the oldest child, you probably didn\u2019t get that benefit.\n\nMiddle children are often neglected and struggle with abandonment issue and often become co-dependent in their relationships. Tia went from being the middle child to the oldest and for 5-ish years, she took the escalating brunt of it.\n\nThen both of you are gone and for two years, Maya gets ALL of it! Real fast, real quick, super intense.\n\nTia is probably thinking that the only person who was truly there for her, her anchor, doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s enough. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what you think.\n\nBut the thing is, at the root of all of this, you had to grow up so fast (too fast) to care for them. And like any parent, Maya (who\u2019s pretty much like the prodigal son to you) comes back, and as her \"father figure\", you went into \"dad mode\".\n\nI think she truly changed. I think Tia has every right to feel hurt. But I also think you need to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that your parents abuse has had a profound effect on you that makes you want to take care of everybody.\n\nYou\u2019re a good brother. Keep doing your best!", "She was willing to let you kick her sister out to give her a place to live.

Or did she not know about your plan to kick her sister out in favor of her?", "Of course she regrets it. It had consequences for her. Just because you're blind doesn't mean others don't see the big blinking spots. And obviously she never said anything about Tia yet. Is too soon, give her a few weeks and you'll see the comments here and there. Or better yet, she'll do another being upset and not telling you so that you could draw it out of her. Boy, you're getting so played... she wants Tia out so you can focus on her instead.", "In your original post you kept saying Maya wasn't independent enough, that's why you were going to kick Tia out.

He was actively saying she was lying to manipulate me.\n\nShe's not my golden child. I fucked up, but that's not what it means.

Hell even our therapist understood it wasnt.", "Maya was abused as well. Her parents forced her into a position to engage as an abuser as well. That in itself is a form of abuse. Have some empathy for what was a child during much of this abuse.", "Read the comments. Everyone is telling him he's failed and that he hasn't done enough. Sure, he messed up by not taking his one sister's trauma into account. Yes, that I'll give you, but he's also just a brother who also grew up in a traumatic home. He's not going to make the best decisions 100% of the time. He is, however, trying to do better. That's what I'm choosing to focus on. He realized he messed up and is trying to make amends while trying to help another traumatized sister. That's a whole dynamic to consider. He stopped pushing, made space for the first sister and focused on her again. \n\nPeople mess up. He realized what he did. That's a good thing. He's also still healing. The idea that he's stomping on boundaries by expressing a wish for a whole, loving family is a bit silly. I want a whole, loving family too. I know it won't happen. I know we are broken beyond repair and that I will only ever have a few of my siblings in my life. Doesn't mean I stop wanting a whole, loving family with healthy family members. He's allowed to want that. Literally everyone wants that. That's my biggest point. He hasn't pushed her to accept an apology. He asked if she was willing, she said no, so he's accepted that. That's a normal conversation to have when your family life is so messed up that kids can't even talk to their parents anymore. \n\nI didn't say \"it's ok to stagnate\" with a \"chipper tune\". I recognized how awful and difficult this situation is and gave him props for recognizing he messed up and for trying to fix it.

It's not that I think you're a bad person, I think you're a victim here. But I can see that Tia is terrified of losing you and now sees that at the drop of a hat Maya can ask for something from you and you'll do anything to give it to her.

Plus unlike Tia she has to do basically all the housework. \n\nI pay for ALL therapy and at least contribute, if not buy, almost all necessuties for BOTH of them. I fucked up yes. But it won't happen again.\n\nYou're talking out of both sides of your mouth. You complain I was willing to let Maya move in, then bitching that I let Tia stay with me and pay for Maya to be elsewhere", "That's not what's happening. We have multiple therapists helping us. You clearly just want to hate on this.", "Some of you are so quick to be judgemental.\n\nOP sounds like he\u2019s trying to help both of his younger sisters but unfortunately he\u2019s in a tough situation. They are all victims of their parents, including Maya.", "I'm so scared for Tia that even a year later op doesn't seem to recognize this is what he's describing happening.", "That not what I said. You're arguing in bad faith at this point.\n\nThere are separate therapists for each therapy (Maya, Tia, Maya+me, Tia+me). You're just looking for stuff to complain about.", "OP has stated they all have individual therapists and he does joint therapy with Maya and Tia repsectively", "Unless you propose I abandon Maya there wasn't some magic solutionbto help everyone.\n\nRight now is the best it can be. I'm still supporting Tia as much as I can. The only times I don't is on advice from the therapist.", "Yes, but these are children under the thumbs of likely the most influential people in their lives. \n\nThis is very similar to parental alienation. \n\nMaya was 11 when OP moved out. \n\nMeaning even before ELEVEN Maya was being trained to abuse her sister.", "Then don't? I've read the other comments you've made on this post, you aren't interested in being empathetic to someone dealing with real life problems. This was a pointless conversation.", "You seemed unwilling to concede that Maya is a victim too and that OP has the best intentions. I made an assumption about why", "They were both abused. The three of them were. \nMaya is doing therapy.", "Except OP isn\u2019t an AH. None of his actions come from malicious or selfish intent. He\u2019s in a tough situation trying to help his two younger sisters after dealing with abusive parents, but some of you will label him an AH, bully, abuser etc etc.\n\nLike I said, bunch of judgemental idiots.", "They can both be victims while Maya is still victimizing Tia. Both of those can be true.", "I literally told him to get his own individual therapist", "Nah, we had a good conversation and he was cool", "He's doing what he's supposed to do", "Glad to hear about the therapists, I would just add that you also deserve your own individual therapist. \n\nAnd I was actually suggesting you should have given that independence and security to Tia so she would be able to have a space she can feel safe and secure in and make her own decisions over.", "Yeah I still think you're an awful brother to her lmao", "So much of a victim that she was cool with Tia being kicked out for her sake", "Not intentionally, I actually just saw that reply on another comment. I had asked you several times and you kept replying and skipping it, so I thought you were dodging the questions because the answer was no", "And I also already responded to that saying good on him and he deserves his own therapist too", "You say \"but\" as if you think I haven't realized that and factored it into my reasoning, but I have.", "Yes it was", "How can I concede to an argument that hasn't been made to me? That doesn't make any sense", "I mean, he was judged an AH in his original post he's now updating...\n\nI'm not labeling him an abuser, I'm observing that he's recreating a dynamic of what traumatized Tia in a way that's sadly common in victims of this kind of abuse. I'd like to hope he'll recognize that and try to fix it, but I will agree with you this isn't likely going to happen here.", "Exactly, that's why forgiveness isn't required.\n\nBut wanting to let Maya on the streets to appease Tia is too much.", "From an outside perspective you come off very hostile... it almost feels like you don't want him helping Maya!", "Nope! That\u2019s the parents job. Not a brothers. He\u2019s doing this because he\u2019s a good person.", "I didn't get my own because of money. Their therapy is more important so that's what I've gone. I don't put any to luxuries like my own. \n\nAnd the whole issue was me suggesting Tia have independence. I was roundly called an asshole for it (correctly).", "[removed]"]}
