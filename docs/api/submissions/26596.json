A few of them invited their SOs and I\u2019ve been dating my gf now for a long enough time that I don\u2019t think it would be awkward to bring her along.\n\nSo my gf gets along with all my friends very well excluding one. My friend Jessica is a very nice girl, and in a lot of ways is very similar to my GF. I think that this is just one of the cases where people who are similar just repel because on paper the should be very good friends. They aren\u2019t outwardly rude to each other however it\u2019s clear they just don\u2019t vibe.\n\nSo 3 things happened on this trip that lead to disaster. \n\n1. First our day there we planned on going to the beach. While we were getting ready my gf realized told me she was feeling bloated and she forgot to pack a one piece to wear. I told her we could just chill in the room and she said she wanted to go down to the beach but we should go buy one at the resort shop. On our way down we ran into Jessica and I told her we were going down to the shop to look for a new bathing suit. Jess then offered to let my gf borrow one of hers, my gf immediately rejected and said we\u2019d buy one.\n\n2. We were at a bar drinking and dancing. Jess is only like 5\u20195 and probably less than 130. She\u2019s also pretty much skin and bones, so she\u2019s a light weight. Eventually she got pretty lit and was finding everyone and trying to get us to take a shot. When she got to us,  I was down but my gf wasn\u2019t. I told her it\u2019d be fun but she said no and Jess said we were being boring. So I just took a shot with Jess. This set her off. \n\n3. The finale issue was that next day me and my gf were late for breakfast because we were getting intimate and lost track of time which was wrong of us. So apparently, Jess said she\u2019d come get us and as she walked passed our door she heard zoo noises and then she went back down to everyone else and said that we were occupying each other and may be a minute. When we got down stairs, the group was cracking jokes which I thought was nbd. Then they said Jess heard us i which my gf got mad.\n\nThis was apparently the straw that broke the camels back. My GF snapped on her and told her that Jess has been being catty to her all trip and she\u2019s been just trying to have a good time. She told her to stop being such a pickme bitch to her. This caused Jess to cry.\n\nI told my GF she needed to apologize to her and resolve whatever beef they have. My gf said that Jess needs to apologize to her for acting like she did and that I\u2019m being a dick for taking her side. We\u2019ve been fighting about this since we got back and things are now awkward with Jess.\n\nMy friends are split on this as some think that my gf was being overboard while some think she may have had a point, which I don\u2019t understand.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694361465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f3t7x/aita_for_telling_my26m_girlfriend_that_she25f/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did she have a SO on the trip? Would her swim suit have fit your girlfriend?  Is your girlfriend shy? Does your girlfriend drink? Or drink hard alcohol?\n\nBecause that makes a huge difference.  One thing to be lent a bathing suit. Another thing to be offered a bathing suit that everyone knows is going to be too small. Even if it is just height wise let alone weight wise. \n\nThe other two look like a single girl that keeps coming to get the attention of \u201cher\u201d man. Pestering for shots, maybe she felt you guys were having an intimate conversation or such. And then coming to get you out of bed, catching looks at you, spending time. Maybe hoping that she could convince you to leave the gf to get ready on your own and come down with her. Talking about the noises, hoping to embarrass gf in front of everyone.\n\nEdit to add SO question.", " Its not personal against anyone else that I'm disinclined to borrow their swimsuit or to do shots to make anyone else happy. And my only point is your GF wasn't being a stick in the mud. Jess would have gotten on my nerves a mite too had I been your GF. \n\nAs for Jess being indiscrete and joking about your intimacies with the whole group was bound to cause some discomfort for somebody. \n\nI would not want to spend time with your friend Jess. And if you kept pestering me about it, I wouldn't want to spend much time with you either. \"Apologize? Come to earth man. And then get a grip.\"\n\nYTA because you seem to think that your GF and Jess must be friendly because you and Jess are friendly? Nothing could be further from the truth.

It\u2019s telling that Jess gets a name in this story but your girlfriend doesn\u2019t. Jess does sound like an annoying pick me who tried to get under your girlfriends skin and you\u2019re taking her side (which I\u2019m guessing is exactly what Jess wanted). If I was your girlfriend I would be seriously considering if I wanted to continue competing with another girl for my boyfriend. And no I wouldn\u2019t. So you need to ask yourself is Jess worth losing your girlfriend for and then act accordingly.", "With exception of the first \"issue\" (which isn't an issue at all, it's not unreasonable for your girlfriend not to want to borrow someone else's suit), Jess actually sounds like the problem to me. So YTA.\n\nWhen it comes to certain things, like drinking and intimacy, you need to have a certain level of respect and tact and it sounded like Jess has none. You don't call people boring because they don't want to drink, and you don't go around telling everyone you heard your friends having sex. This isn't a TV series where things like that are funny.", "YTA. I gotta say...I don't get why you think your GF was the sole issue and owes Jess an apology. It seems like you're looking for blame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Not everyone is comfortable borrowing a bathing suit from someone; I've heard people say it's similar to wearing someone else's underwear so there's an \"ick\" factor. \n2. She's entitled to NOT be pressured to do a shot (not everyone thinks it's fun). And...drunk people pressuring others to do shots is boring.\n3. \"she heard zoo noises and then she went back down to everyone else and said that we were occupying each other' - THAT is gross of Jess.\n\nGFs reaction may have been more intense than necessary but I don't agree that Jess wasn't problematic.", "Yes.

A vagina is different from a penis. You can wear other guys' underwear if you want, but we women cannot risk picking up some random shit like an infection by wearing another woman's underwear/bathing suits. Educate yourself, you sound ignorant.\n\nRegarding the other issues, Jess comes across as a pick me woman. The fact that she told the group you two were having sex...is she 12? Who on Earth goes around broadcasting that kind of stuff? It was none of her damn business.\n\nYou're delusional if you think that your GF needs to apologize to Jess. And I feel sorry for your GF, because she's right. You're a dick for taking Jess' side. If you like her so much, and you take her side over your partner's, you're dating the wrong chick. \n\nGrow up. You're treating your GF like crap for standing up for herself.", "OK... so, for one, #1 is a non-issue, like at all. Most people don't like borrowing someone else's swimsuit, it's practically like lending out underwear. Not sure how that even made the list as an issue. **Edit:** Made this comment before realizing the potential size differentiation. Homie, c'mon... I know you're only in your 20s and all, but there are toddlers who could recognize this as passive-aggressive.\n\nBut it kinda sounds to me like Jess is being a bit territorial. It's not uncommon for a tight-knit group of friends to have a person who goes above and beyond to be a little... hmm... *antagonizing*. Not saying it has anything to do with having a romantic interest in someone who brings their gf/bf around the group (though definitely it's a possibility). But it's like they take hazing to an extreme, even if the gf/bf in question has been around for a bit. And Jess sounds like she's doing that. Since I don't know anyone else's gender or anything beyond what you've told us, I can't comment on whether or not she deserves the \"pick-me\" title or not, but it's certainly not out of the question.\n\nI dunno, man, I'm with your girlfriend on this one. Hard to comment on anything without knowing the full story, but I don't know if you're seeing the situation clearly enough to be demanding any apologies.\n\nSo YTA. I think you're being a bit dense in this situation and want to think highly of Jess as a friend and may be blind to how her actions are actually coming off.", "YTA, so when are you going to break up with your GF (who u didn\u2019t bother to even name in this post), and date Jessica/Jess", "YTA. \n\n1. Skinny girl offering clothes that won't fit (maybe Jess is that oblivious or more likely she was being passive aggressive). And yeah it's kinda gross to share swimsuits. \n\n2. It's ok for Jess to insult your girlfriend by calling her boring. No backup from you. That right there is all I need to know to know YTA. \n\n3. And now Jess and your whole friend group owe your girlfriend an apology for making fun of her. Jess is mean. And you don't care. Honestly your girlfriend should leave because you are either oblivious or just don't care about her. \n\nAnd then you choose to insist your girlfriend owes Jess an apology but Jess doesn't because Jess matters more. \n\nAnd I would have dumped you right there.", "I'm happy I went to the comments to see YTA because simply I think you don't even like your girlfriend lol you just like being surrounded by girls", "YTA - You\u2019ve not once said anything positive about your GF compared to Jess. Just by this post alone I can see you favour her so no wonder your GF dislikes her, if it\u2019s obvious to us then it\u2019s obvious to her. \n\nJess deliberately told a group of people what you were doing and caused embarrassment to your girlfriend, and you expect her to apologise?", "YTA.\n\nSounds like you have a crush on bad girl, boundary-less Jess. Sounds like Jess is having fun trying to drive a wedge between you and your girlfriend. Sounds like my SIL that dates married men because she gets off on driving a wedge between a man and his SO.\n\nIt's nasty to offer someone your bathing suit! in so many ways! (you have no idea how women's minds work) horrible that you thought your GF didn't have a right to reject it. Excuse me but I don't want my flower to touch a surface that someone else's has (that's why stores have a protective strip on bathing suits), and I do not have the same taste as you do! how dare you. Especially when I definitely would have wanted to go shopping at the resort store with my SO. This was NOT nice of Jess! you're clueless.\n\nSomeone that does shots and dances around the bar trying to get everyone to do shots with her?? wow...sad. You siding with the \"other woman\" by falling for her lame peer pressure, making your GF feel second rate... Jess: don't be boring, you: I like Jess and I don't want her to think I'm boring, better drink! damn GF making me look boring why can't she make Jess happy.\n\nJess telling everyone you're having sex? huh? making zoo noises?? who TF cares? aren't you all adults? Jess IS an immature catty B with obvious mental issues. Did you grab your GF and make a point how much you loved F-ing her before breakfast!? or did you shrivel into shame because your were having sex with your GF and you couldn't stand up to your teasing friends? what vibes where you giving her huh? wake up already.\n\nLets face facts, you want Jess. You're making that 100% clear. You don't think your GF is as fun as Jess is and you're not proud your banging your GF. This is why men with single female friends are not good commitment material.

Mainly, don't undermine your partner.", "YTA for expecting your gf to apologize, not that it's going to be your problem for long.

You have no idea what jess actually heard or said to your friends.   Your friends are immature jerks for making jokes which obviously made your gf very uncomfortable.   I guarantee that Jess said all the zoo noises were coming from gf not you.\n\nYou sir, owe your gf an apology for allowing your so-called friends embarrass her.  Just because you didn\u2019t think their jokes were bad, you had to realize that your gf was mortified.  The only criticism you have of your gf is that after days of being picked on by Jess, she finally snapped.   I commend her, I would have done it a lot sooner and not been as polite.

A few of them invited their SOs and I\u2019ve been dating my gf now for a long enough time that I don\u2019t think it would be awkward to bring her along.\n\nSo my gf gets along with all my friends very well excluding one. My friend Jessica is a very nice girl, and in a lot of ways is very similar to my GF. I think that this is just one of the cases where people who are similar just repel because on paper the should be very good friends. They aren\u2019t outwardly rude to each other however it\u2019s clear they just don\u2019t vibe.\n\nSo 3 things happened on this trip that lead to disaster. \n\n1. First our day there we planned on going to the beach. While we were getting ready my gf realized told me she was feeling bloated and she forgot to pack a one piece to wear. I told her we could just chill in the room and she said she wanted to go down to the beach but we should go buy one at the resort shop. On our way down we ran into Jessica and I told her we were going down to the shop to look for a new bathing suit. Jess then offered to let my gf borrow one of hers, my gf immediately rejected and said we\u2019d buy one.\n\n2. We were at a bar drinking and dancing. Jess is only like 5\u20195 and probably less than 130. She\u2019s also pretty much skin and bones, so she\u2019s a light weight. Eventually she got pretty lit and was finding everyone and trying to get us to take a shot. When she got to us,  I was down but my gf wasn\u2019t. I told her it\u2019d be fun but she said no and Jess said we were being boring. So I just took a shot with Jess. This set her off. \n\n3. The finale issue was that next day me and my gf were late for breakfast because we were getting intimate and lost track of time which was wrong of us. So apparently, Jess said she\u2019d come get us and as she walked passed our door she heard zoo noises and then she went back down to everyone else and said that we were occupying each other and may be a minute. When we got down stairs, the group was cracking jokes which I thought was nbd. Then they said Jess heard us i which my gf got mad.\n\nThis was apparently the straw that broke the camels back. My GF snapped on her and told her that Jess has been being catty to her all trip and she\u2019s been just trying to have a good time. She told her to stop being such a pickme bitch to her. This caused Jess to cry.\n\nI told my GF she needed to apologize to her and resolve whatever beef they have. My gf said that Jess needs to apologize to her for acting like she did and that I\u2019m being a dick for taking her side. We\u2019ve been fighting about this since we got back and things are now awkward with Jess.\n\nMy friends are split on this as some think that my gf was being overboard while some think she may have had a point, which I don\u2019t understand.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Skipping the beach to shop, hanging solo in the club where your friends had to track you down to do shots, skipping breakfast to get carnal, and not allowing your friends to rightfully poke fun at you for bailing. Jess was trying to treat you both as friends and she got yelled at by your girlfriend.\n\nKeep it up and your friends will start to fade away.", "YTA OP and seemingly a little unaware. Other than 1 which could be; your gf being overly sensitive, could be Jess being subtly mean without you noticing or could be neutral Jess is in the wrong. Jess was being annoying by pressuring people to take a shot and calling them boring for not doing so and your gf being hurt by being called boring and her bf adding to peer pressure isn\u2019t her being sensitive. But no matter if Jess and your gf normally got along or were neutral, Jess telling an entire group of people that you were having sex whilst on a group holiday would 100000% be Jess being TA. What a childish form of humiliation. Your gf was laughed at by a group of your friends whom she is mainly just friendly with for a private moment in a private hotel room whilst holidaying with her bf. I\u2019d be mortified, Jess should have not said a word - just said \u201cThey\u2019re busy, they should be here soon.\u201d", "Jess is single.\n\nNow that I think about it, Jess is really small.

It was OP who said zoo noises not Jess", "I\u2019ve worn other guys underwear before. But I guess that was only when we were hooking up. But I didn\u2019t really see the issue if it was clean.\n\nFrom how I saw it, she wasn\u2019t being like genuinely she was being playful.", "To be fair, the OP said zoo noises, not Jess", "we all know a Jess- ain\u2019t that the damn truth.", "Oof, I was with you right up until you said men who have single female friends aren't commitment material.

Jess and OP deserve it, though.", "Yes", "And it sounds like OP is very happy to be Jess' territory.", "Excellent point!", "She said it was catty", "Yes", "I didn\u2019t think it was gross if it\u2019s was washed. I\u2019ve shared a lot worse things with other guys. \n\nThat\u2019s fair but it\u2019s not like I forced her to take a shot. She said no, I told her it would be fun she still said no and then me and Jess took a shot without her. Okay", "I think the bathing suit issue is bc (per OP\u2019s comments) Jess is super thin, Girlfriend is not, and therefore offering it was a catty move because it would be too small.", "Depending on how long y'all have been tight, how has Jess acted around girlfriends you may have brought around in the past? Or girlfriends/boyfriends other folks in the group have?\n\nAnd, friendly advice as you seem to be in hot water already, I would encourage you to avoid language like \"normal\" weight as I don't think that's going to do you any favors.", "Jess sounds like a mean girl and she was trying to make your gf insecure and distrespecting her", "Right, and it's a bit alarming that OP thinks his girlfriend is the problem.", "It's quite sad, isn't it?\n\nI definitely enjoy a good drink, probably too much. But the idea someone can't be fun while sober (or *not* totally shitfaced) is absurd. Definitely says more about the person doing the pressuring than it says about who's on the receiving end.", "I'm leaning towards she did it on purpose. She might have a secret crush on OP, or be one of those \"friends\" who don't want to lose their friends to romantic partners, or just isn't a nice person (so my comment doesn't get removed again), that she antagonised this poor girlfriend.", "I feel you.

Embarrassing your girlfriend in front of all your friends by announcing yalls\u2019 sex life. The final dig.\n\nShe is a pick me, and she sucks. People like Jess thrive off small digs but especially subtle digs so they can play it off and to make their target seem like the crazy one when their target finally snap. You think Jess is a nice person because you have never been the target of her digs.\n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d was described perfectly by your girlfriend.

Most would assume sex but it\u2019s not totally explicit", "When I dated men, I was almost exclusively into ones that had female friends. They were more likely to be respectful, be open to such crazy ideas like \"women can be funny and intelligent\", and had been exposed to the shenanigans that occur on both sides of the fence and weren't as likely to pass everything little thing off as \"hysteria\" or \"being crazy\" since they'd heard the perspectives of women they're close with talking about their dating experiences. \n\nThere were *definitely* a couple I backed out of because my spidey sense told me there was something more (and it has a pretty high accuracy rate in this regard). But who am I to judge two people who'd developed feels for each other over years? If my dating some bro for a month made two people realize how they feel about each other, then my job here is done - I wish you the best of luck. It can happen but it won't happen every time. For the most part, they were just friends and absolutely nothing more. I'm *still* acquainted with a few of the women I met through them, years and years later. *Great* people! \n\nThe whole \"women and men can't be *just* friends\" thing is such an antiquated and *learned* concept.
