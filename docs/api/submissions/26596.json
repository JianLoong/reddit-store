A few of them invited their SOs and I\u2019ve been dating my gf now for a long enough time that I don\u2019t think it would be awkward to bring her along.\n\nSo my gf gets along with all my friends very well excluding one. My friend Jessica is a very nice girl, and in a lot of ways is very similar to my GF. I think that this is just one of the cases where people who are similar just repel because on paper the should be very good friends. They aren\u2019t outwardly rude to each other however it\u2019s clear they just don\u2019t vibe.\n\nSo 3 things happened on this trip that lead to disaster. \n\n1. First our day there we planned on going to the beach. While we were getting ready my gf realized told me she was feeling bloated and she forgot to pack a one piece to wear. I told her we could just chill in the room and she said she wanted to go down to the beach but we should go buy one at the resort shop. On our way down we ran into Jessica and I told her we were going down to the shop to look for a new bathing suit. Jess then offered to let my gf borrow one of hers, my gf immediately rejected and said we\u2019d buy one.\n\n2. We were at a bar drinking and dancing. Jess is only like 5\u20195 and probably less than 130. She\u2019s also pretty much skin and bones, so she\u2019s a light weight. Eventually she got pretty lit and was finding everyone and trying to get us to take a shot. When she got to us,  I was down but my gf wasn\u2019t. I told her it\u2019d be fun but she said no and Jess said we were being boring. So I just took a shot with Jess. This set her off. \n\n3. The finale issue was that next day me and my gf were late for breakfast because we were getting intimate and lost track of time which was wrong of us. So apparently, Jess said she\u2019d come get us and as she walked passed our door she heard zoo noises and then she went back down to everyone else and said that we were occupying each other and may be a minute. When we got down stairs, the group was cracking jokes which I thought was nbd. Then they said Jess heard us i which my gf got mad.\n\nThis was apparently the straw that broke the camels back. My GF snapped on her and told her that Jess has been being catty to her all trip and she\u2019s been just trying to have a good time. She told her to stop being such a pickme bitch to her. This caused Jess to cry.\n\nI told my GF she needed to apologize to her and resolve whatever beef they have. My gf said that Jess needs to apologize to her for acting like she did and that I\u2019m being a dick for taking her side. We\u2019ve been fighting about this since we got back and things are now awkward with Jess.\n\nMy friends are split on this as some think that my gf was being overboard while some think she may have had a point, which I don\u2019t understand.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694361465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f3t7x/aita_for_telling_my26m_girlfriend_that_she25f/", "score": 1491, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did she have a SO on the trip? Would her swim suit have fit your girlfriend?  Is your girlfriend shy? Does your girlfriend drink? Or drink hard alcohol?\n\nBecause that makes a huge difference.  One thing to be lent a bathing suit. Another thing to be offered a bathing suit that everyone knows is going to be too small. Even if it is just height wise let alone weight wise. \n\nThe other two look like a single girl that keeps coming to get the attention of \u201cher\u201d man. Pestering for shots, maybe she felt you guys were having an intimate conversation or such. And then coming to get you out of bed, catching looks at you, spending time. Maybe hoping that she could convince you to leave the gf to get ready on your own and come down with her. Talking about the noises, hoping to embarrass gf in front of everyone.\n\nEdit to add SO question.", " Its not personal against anyone else that I'm disinclined to borrow their swimsuit or to do shots to make anyone else happy. And my only point is your GF wasn't being a stick in the mud. Jess would have gotten on my nerves a mite too had I been your GF. \n\nAs for Jess being indiscrete and joking about your intimacies with the whole group was bound to cause some discomfort for somebody. \n\nI would not want to spend time with your friend Jess. And if you kept pestering me about it, I wouldn't want to spend much time with you either. \"Apologize? Come to earth man. And then get a grip.\"\n\nYTA because you seem to think that your GF and Jess must be friendly because you and Jess are friendly? Nothing could be further from the truth.

It\u2019s telling that Jess gets a name in this story but your girlfriend doesn\u2019t. Jess does sound like an annoying pick me who tried to get under your girlfriends skin and you\u2019re taking her side (which I\u2019m guessing is exactly what Jess wanted). If I was your girlfriend I would be seriously considering if I wanted to continue competing with another girl for my boyfriend. And no I wouldn\u2019t. So you need to ask yourself is Jess worth losing your girlfriend for and then act accordingly.", "With exception of the first \"issue\" (which isn't an issue at all, it's not unreasonable for your girlfriend not to want to borrow someone else's suit), Jess actually sounds like the problem to me. So YTA.\n\nWhen it comes to certain things, like drinking and intimacy, you need to have a certain level of respect and tact and it sounded like Jess has none. You don't call people boring because they don't want to drink, and you don't go around telling everyone you heard your friends having sex. This isn't a TV series where things like that are funny.", "YTA. I gotta say...I don't get why you think your GF was the sole issue and owes Jess an apology. It seems like you're looking for blame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Not everyone is comfortable borrowing a bathing suit from someone; I've heard people say it's similar to wearing someone else's underwear so there's an \"ick\" factor. \n2. She's entitled to NOT be pressured to do a shot (not everyone thinks it's fun). And...drunk people pressuring others to do shots is boring.\n3. \"she heard zoo noises and then she went back down to everyone else and said that we were occupying each other' - THAT is gross of Jess.\n\nGFs reaction may have been more intense than necessary but I don't agree that Jess wasn't problematic.", "Yes.

A vagina is different from a penis. You can wear other guys' underwear if you want, but we women cannot risk picking up some random shit like an infection by wearing another woman's underwear/bathing suits. Educate yourself, you sound ignorant.\n\nRegarding the other issues, Jess comes across as a pick me woman. The fact that she told the group you two were having sex...is she 12? Who on Earth goes around broadcasting that kind of stuff? It was none of her damn business.\n\nYou're delusional if you think that your GF needs to apologize to Jess. And I feel sorry for your GF, because she's right. You're a dick for taking Jess' side. If you like her so much, and you take her side over your partner's, you're dating the wrong chick. \n\nGrow up. You're treating your GF like crap for standing up for herself.", "OK... so, for one, #1 is a non-issue, like at all. Most people don't like borrowing someone else's swimsuit, it's practically like lending out underwear. Not sure how that even made the list as an issue. **Edit:** Made this comment before realizing the potential size differentiation. Homie, c'mon... I know you're only in your 20s and all, but there are toddlers who could recognize this as passive-aggressive.\n\nBut it kinda sounds to me like Jess is being a bit territorial. It's not uncommon for a tight-knit group of friends to have a person who goes above and beyond to be a little... hmm... *antagonizing*. Not saying it has anything to do with having a romantic interest in someone who brings their gf/bf around the group (though definitely it's a possibility). But it's like they take hazing to an extreme, even if the gf/bf in question has been around for a bit. And Jess sounds like she's doing that. Since I don't know anyone else's gender or anything beyond what you've told us, I can't comment on whether or not she deserves the \"pick-me\" title or not, but it's certainly not out of the question.\n\nI dunno, man, I'm with your girlfriend on this one. Hard to comment on anything without knowing the full story, but I don't know if you're seeing the situation clearly enough to be demanding any apologies.\n\nSo YTA. I think you're being a bit dense in this situation and want to think highly of Jess as a friend and may be blind to how her actions are actually coming off.", "YTA, so when are you going to break up with your GF (who u didn\u2019t bother to even name in this post), and date Jessica/Jess", "YTA. \n\n1. Skinny girl offering clothes that won't fit (maybe Jess is that oblivious or more likely she was being passive aggressive). And yeah it's kinda gross to share swimsuits. \n\n2. It's ok for Jess to insult your girlfriend by calling her boring. No backup from you. That right there is all I need to know to know YTA. \n\n3. And now Jess and your whole friend group owe your girlfriend an apology for making fun of her. Jess is mean. And you don't care. Honestly your girlfriend should leave because you are either oblivious or just don't care about her. \n\nAnd then you choose to insist your girlfriend owes Jess an apology but Jess doesn't because Jess matters more. \n\nAnd I would have dumped you right there.", "I'm happy I went to the comments to see YTA because simply I think you don't even like your girlfriend lol you just like being surrounded by girls", "YTA - You\u2019ve not once said anything positive about your GF compared to Jess. Just by this post alone I can see you favour her so no wonder your GF dislikes her, if it\u2019s obvious to us then it\u2019s obvious to her. \n\nJess deliberately told a group of people what you were doing and caused embarrassment to your girlfriend, and you expect her to apologise?", "YTA.\n\nSounds like you have a crush on bad girl, boundary-less Jess. Sounds like Jess is having fun trying to drive a wedge between you and your girlfriend. Sounds like my SIL that dates married men because she gets off on driving a wedge between a man and his SO.\n\nIt's nasty to offer someone your bathing suit! in so many ways! (you have no idea how women's minds work) horrible that you thought your GF didn't have a right to reject it. Excuse me but I don't want my flower to touch a surface that someone else's has (that's why stores have a protective strip on bathing suits), and I do not have the same taste as you do! how dare you. Especially when I definitely would have wanted to go shopping at the resort store with my SO. This was NOT nice of Jess! you're clueless.\n\nSomeone that does shots and dances around the bar trying to get everyone to do shots with her?? wow...sad. You siding with the \"other woman\" by falling for her lame peer pressure, making your GF feel second rate... Jess: don't be boring, you: I like Jess and I don't want her to think I'm boring, better drink! damn GF making me look boring why can't she make Jess happy.\n\nJess telling everyone you're having sex? huh? making zoo noises?? who TF cares? aren't you all adults? Jess IS an immature catty B with obvious mental issues. Did you grab your GF and make a point how much you loved F-ing her before breakfast!? or did you shrivel into shame because your were having sex with your GF and you couldn't stand up to your teasing friends? what vibes where you giving her huh? wake up already.\n\nLets face facts, you want Jess. You're making that 100% clear. You don't think your GF is as fun as Jess is and you're not proud your banging your GF. OP YOU'RE the classic reason why men with single female friends are not good commitment material.

Mainly, don't undermine your partner.", "YTA for expecting your gf to apologize, not that it's going to be your problem for long.

You have no idea what jess actually heard or said to your friends.   Your friends are immature jerks for making jokes which obviously made your gf very uncomfortable.   I guarantee that Jess said all the zoo noises were coming from gf not you.\n\nYou sir, owe your gf an apology for allowing your so-called friends embarrass her.  Just because you didn\u2019t think their jokes were bad, you had to realize that your gf was mortified.  The only criticism you have of your gf is that after days of being picked on by Jess, she finally snapped.   I commend her, I would have done it a lot sooner and not been as polite.

A few of them invited their SOs and I\u2019ve been dating my gf now for a long enough time that I don\u2019t think it would be awkward to bring her along.\n\nSo my gf gets along with all my friends very well excluding one. My friend Jessica is a very nice girl, and in a lot of ways is very similar to my GF. I think that this is just one of the cases where people who are similar just repel because on paper the should be very good friends. They aren\u2019t outwardly rude to each other however it\u2019s clear they just don\u2019t vibe.\n\nSo 3 things happened on this trip that lead to disaster. \n\n1. First our day there we planned on going to the beach. While we were getting ready my gf realized told me she was feeling bloated and she forgot to pack a one piece to wear. I told her we could just chill in the room and she said she wanted to go down to the beach but we should go buy one at the resort shop. On our way down we ran into Jessica and I told her we were going down to the shop to look for a new bathing suit. Jess then offered to let my gf borrow one of hers, my gf immediately rejected and said we\u2019d buy one.\n\n2. We were at a bar drinking and dancing. Jess is only like 5\u20195 and probably less than 130. She\u2019s also pretty much skin and bones, so she\u2019s a light weight. Eventually she got pretty lit and was finding everyone and trying to get us to take a shot. When she got to us,  I was down but my gf wasn\u2019t. I told her it\u2019d be fun but she said no and Jess said we were being boring. So I just took a shot with Jess. This set her off. \n\n3. The finale issue was that next day me and my gf were late for breakfast because we were getting intimate and lost track of time which was wrong of us. So apparently, Jess said she\u2019d come get us and as she walked passed our door she heard zoo noises and then she went back down to everyone else and said that we were occupying each other and may be a minute. When we got down stairs, the group was cracking jokes which I thought was nbd. Then they said Jess heard us i which my gf got mad.\n\nThis was apparently the straw that broke the camels back. My GF snapped on her and told her that Jess has been being catty to her all trip and she\u2019s been just trying to have a good time. She told her to stop being such a pickme bitch to her. This caused Jess to cry.\n\nI told my GF she needed to apologize to her and resolve whatever beef they have.

Jess graciously offered to loan your GF a one piece suit. Your girlfriend didn't want to do that and turned down the offer. Again, nothing to see here. Neither you, your GF, or your friend did anything wrong here. This was all a perfectly reasonable exchange amongst friends. Your girlfriend was feeling insecure about her body indirect comparison to Jess so she chose to attach malicious intent where it didn't exist.\n\nYou and your friends were enjoying some adult beverages. Jessica asked everyone if they wanted to do a shot with her. You were the only person who wanted to do a shot and everyone else declined the invitation. Again, nothing bad happened here. No one did anything wrong in offering the shot, agreeing to take the shot, or refusing one. \n\nYou and your girlfriend slightly messed up by forgetting about breakfast and keeping everyone waiting.

The rest of the stuff is not necessarily out of line depending on the friend group. In some friend groups it's normal to do a lot of shots together even to a degree that would be pressure to a stranger, and joke around about sex.\n\nIDK it's complicated. I can see both sides here. If Jess is doing this on purpose to undermine the GF then she's doing a very good job of maintaining plausible deniability. But it could also be a situation of Jess treating the GF like they're old friends as an extension of the GF being in the group, even though the GF doesn't have that same level of comfort, and the GF is attributing her behavior to malice rather than cluelessness.

Fit, lithe Lions", "Those were OPs words though not Jess\u2019s from what I can tell", "But OP didn't state that Jess was the one who said the zoo noises comment, it (to me) sounded like OP described their sex that way, and Jess only said they were occupying themselves. It's very ambiguous in the way it's written. I'd like to know what ACTUALLY was said", ">Also, ZOO noises? As someone who is a bigger person, that is fucking offensive\n\nI mean, it's a fairly comical way of describing your friends having sex.  This shouldn't be offensive to have your friends describe your sex noise considering they were having sex in a place they were all staying.", "Man everyone with reading comprehension is getting downvoted to hell. So many people hating Jess on principle and so are associating OP's word choices with Jess", "This comment section is people reading what they want and then jumping to conclusions. Like the focus on her \"pushing drinking\" instead of the GF blowing up because OP said yes to a shot.\n\nThen you someone who apparently knows how to read points it out and gets downvoted", "So you want her to have sex with you?", "Maybe read. It was about the OP.", "He said she wouldn't have minded if it was someone else, just that it was Jess. But if you read the rest of my comments you will see that I did say it was nasty and wrong to do that.", "So, as usual, the lede was buried?", "And those were just the three things op *noticed*. Or that took place in front of him. Jess was def making more digs all weekend", "Non autistic social bonds are exhausting.", "I get it how these things could make someone feel self conscious ig or that it was catty but on the other hand they also seem a bit mundane especially among friends. I think the main issue is Jess being a female friend of OPs an interacting how they notmally would with OPs gf  being an outsider where those same playful gestures would be severely out of place.", "Yeah I found the comment. His comments just reinforce my negative view of him.", "He  clarified in the comments for those that needed it  and said Jess made the zoo noises comments\n\nMight also be that Jess called her boring for not drinking. And not only did OP do the shots but he also did not defend his gf\u2019s choice. He actually tried to convince her to do them by saying it would be fun \nYou are right about reading comprehension, because you missed some key points", "It\u2019s like being on those sites that think everything is fat phobic. I\u2019m so confused how they\u2019re getting to thus conclusion.", "The way you wrote it paints it as a generalisation, not as a specific thing for the OP", "OPs GF can sense it too. They always know", "\u2728  *SWASS*  \u2728", "To be fair, this isn't necessarily true. It's an example OP chose, not an example the GF gave. She could be talking about other things OP didn't pick up on and may have zero issue with Jess offering her the swimsuit.", "Nah. It's correct. \n\nIn theory it \\*could\\* have been nice - gross and put GF on the spot, and if they aren't the same size it very well could have been an intentional dig (OP mentioned how small Jess is).", "So if you don't think there was anything wrong with your gf saying no, why list it as one of the examples? Also, you'll find few women are ok wearing another person's bathers; we don't wear underwear under them like some guys might with board shorts so it's a hygiene thing (why do you think the bathers in the shop have a hygiene sticker over the crotch?). Plus the fact that your gf might not be the same size and if she's already feeling self conscious this will just make it worse. Dude, get a clue", "Typical day on AITA.", "I don't have a problem with down-votes. I am not looking to get advertising perks or become a paid promoter or even be the most trusted or float to the top so more people can see. If people read my comments that aren't the OP and they don't like em it's no prob to me. When I post anything, I know, no matter what some people are gonna love it and some will hate it. \n\nI believe everyone should have an opinion and I do not want everyone to agree with me. I don't need an echo and some times I am wrong :o!! \n\nAlso, some people obviously don't know how to read and project.", "Agreed! I have edited to reflect. Thank you for your input.", "OP has mentioned that Jess gave him a BJ in the past, but denies that it was sex.", "OMG TIL.", "This is a leap of epic proportions. I'm not saying it's not the case, but your assertion that she's a pickme \"for sure\"? Give me a break.", "Let us say it MAY be gross. Some ppl consider bath suits as underwear, some are comfortable with exchanging it.\n\nWhat makes it gross (imho) is the fact, OP mentions BMI of his \"female friend\". He does not mention BMI of his GF. This lack of information is meaningful in the context. OP may be so dumb, not to realize all this little offences, but \"female friend\" is subtly hostile in all 3 episodes mentioned.", "Interesting. I couldn't imagine going to the zoo to see farm animals. Must be an American thing", "To be fair, I had to google it after I realized my second fuck up in this thread. I\u2019m just glad it turned out to be true. I\u2019ve never seen a cow at a zoo before", "You have to consider the broader behaviour though. Yes, for you, it could come off as sincere. However, given everything else we know about Jess (sharing about their sex noises and ribbing on them? ew.) we can reasonably assume malicious intent.", "Holy shit, thank you for quoting that. With this new information, I\u2019ve concluded this man is both dense as fuck and definitely not over Jess.", "No I think you put into words what I couldn\u2019t nicely. I kept wanting to comment but didn\u2019t because I couldn\u2019t articulate anything well. You and others have done it better. I just don\u2019t get it either. Like even through each comment made it was pointless\u2026 why do this? Why even tell the story the way OP does? I really hope Unnamed GF leaves him."]}
