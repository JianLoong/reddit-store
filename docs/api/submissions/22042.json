Not everything is a joke. She has tried for a baby for years and you couldn't give her a moment of earnest support and congratulations? This is exactly like people who get up and give attention-sucking, allegedly funny best man or MOH speeches at weddings or, worse yet, stand up with a jokey joke \"JK, not really objecting\" objection. \n\nFYI, if she has struggled with infertility for 3 years and you didn't hear about this pregnancy until 3 months, she's likely had miscarriages or chemical pregnancies you didn't know about. Even if that's not the case she has almost certainly spent the last couple months scared this pregnancy won't make it. Of all the jokes you could make, that one was the worst.", "They\u2019ve been trying for three years and your first response is to joke to her about giving her a ride to an abortion clinic? They\u2019ve been trying for three years!This joke was insensitive considering she may be petrified about miscarrying after trying for so long. \n\nYou\u2019re jokes may have worked back them, but the circumstances have now changed. Apologize to your friend. Y T A", "YTA:  That wasn't the time to joke.  Your friend who has been trying for 3 years to have a child finally achieved their dream and shared that information with her closest friends.  And the first words out of your mouth was a joke about terminating her pregnancy. \n\nYou kinda showed what kind of friend you are because you couldn't be serious for one second to congratulate your friend", "YTA Being \"childfree\" does not give you permission to make vile comments. It's a choice not a personality trait.\n\n>On Friday, Alice, a couple other friends, and I went out to lunch and Alice told us that she was 3 months pregnant. I jokingly said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Let me know if you need a ride to the clinic.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of friend says something so nasty to a friend who announced their pregnancy?", "YTA. She's been trying three freaking years and is past the first trimester, so I guess she trusted you were a good enough friend to celebrate with her. Instead you crack an abortion joke. You need to apologize and show empathy to people you care about. Sheesh!", "Nope. You crossed a line with the clinic remark. If you had said something like \"well there goes your vacation in Paris\" maybe you could be forgiven.  Your \"joke\" was completely tasteless. YTA. Good luck fixing this. I could make a \"joke\" about you saving money on a shower gift since you have probably lost a friend, but that would be rude too.", "YTA. Offering to drive your friend to an abortion clinic after she tells you that she\u2019s pregnant after trying for three years wasn\u2019t funny at all. It was just cruel. How would you feel if the next time you\u2019re talking about something your dog did that frustrated you she said something like: \u201cwell that settles it, time for euthanasia\u201d? You wouldn\u2019t appreciate that. I think this friendship might be over because you have proven that you are not supportive of her choice to be a parent.", "When did we stop saying \"Congratulations\" when friends get what they hope for?

When did we collectively decide that others deserve to be shit on because their (perfectly legal and moral) wants don't match our own?\n\nAnd can we get to a place where this doesn't happen? Please?", "YTA there's a difference between jokes between friends who state children currently out in the world vs telling your friend a joke of misfortune when they have been trying for 3 YEARS", "YTA\n\nI am sure it was in jest, but given the context of them struggling to conceive, the timing could have been better. My first choice wouldn't have been to make that kind of joke when she first announced it.", "YTA. Oh come on, you really thought that after 3 years of trying to have a baby an abortion joke was appropriate? I don't care what your humor is typically, you are an adult and should 100% know better than to make an abortion joke at such an occasion. YTA big time.", "YTA.\n\nA joke would have been remarking that this was a bizarre way to say she couldn't cover her bill at a restaurant, not being flippant about terminating a dearly wanted pregnancy.", "YTA- I'm also CF and understand the joking with friends about kids/ pregnancy. BUT you know Alice has been trying to have a baby. You know that they have been trying for 3 years for the baby, which means it wasn't exactly easy for them to conceive (Not sure if you know the intimate details but maybe IVF was used?). The point is you knew that she wanted a baby and that they have struggled to conceive. You should have said congratulations. Text your friend a thoughtful apology for being insensitive to her struggle and your poorly timed joke.", "YTA.   This woman has been trying to have a baby for at least three years.  Joking about abortion or miscarriage to someone who has tried that long to have a baby is at best in poor taste and at worst traumatic.     \n\n\nAs someone who struggled for years before having my own kids, I can tell you that it is terrifying to be pregnant after struggling that long.  With my oldest, I had had dozens of miscarriages before he was born, and I spent the first several months of his life terrified that someone, somewhere was going to realize their mistake and take him from me, or I was going to wake up and realize it was all a cruel dream.   So much about pregnancy is out of our control, and struggling to conceive or carry a pregnancy really highlights that.  It was incredibly insensitive of you to joke about it rather than celebrating something you know your friend has wanted for a long time.", "YTA. 100%. I'm childfree as well, but *wow*. I would never make a \"joke\" like that.", "You didn\u2019t make a joke about her pregnancy, you made a joke about her aborting a very wanted pregnancy. Guess what? That\u2019s not funny! YTA.", "YTA. I understand how you think it's ok. But after they have been trying for 3 years that is absolutely not an ok joke to make.", "YTA. What a horrible joke, especially given how long she's been wanting to have a child. You're lucky if she decides to speak to you again, what a way to signal zero sensitivity and total callousness.", "YTA. A total and possibly unforgivable a hole. How could you say something so horrific?!?! That\u2019s not a joke to someone who has been struggling with infertility. A joke would be \u201ctrading the disposable income for disposable diapers\u201d\u2026not offering to take her for an abor!ion!!!", "what.the.fuck\n\nYTA", "Wow! What a completely inappropriate \"joke.\" YTA!", "YTA:\n\nyour humor/comment and her 3 years of trying to get pregnant did not mix well. best of luck because i think you\u2019ll need it", "YTA.\n\nYou told your friend who had multiple miscarriages and has been trying for years a \u201cjoke\u201d that implied she wanted to end the pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t care if pregnancy issues are on your radar or not, most people understand that what you do when someone tells you they finally have something they\u2019ve been working hard for is to congratulate them. Most people also understand tone and when something is or isn\u2019t appropriate.\n\nI would also like to think that most people know that many women inaccurately blame themselves for their miscarriages, partially because others imply or outright state it\u2019s their fault because people want there to be a reason when bad things happen. Joking that someone wants to end a pregnancy after they\u2019ve had multiple pregnancies end plays into that fear and cycle of accusation. Something not being on your radar isn\u2019t an excuse for thoughtlessness.\n\nFinally, joking about losing disposable income isn\u2019t even close to the \u201cjoke\u201d you made. Your \u201cjoke\u201d was ten times darker than jokes about no longer being able to afford a gym membership or not being able to spontaneously go to Burning Man.\n\nYou messed up to an extreme degree.", "YTA\n\nYou do not, *ever* make jokes to another person about abortion/miscarriage/other ways of ending a pregnancy before birth\n\nMake jokes about the finances, or the size of the bump, or how her bras are now useless, or about buying her bobbles so she doesn't need hubby to hold her hair through morning sickness.\n\nAbortion and miscarriage aren't light hearted jabs", "As a mother who had difficulty conceiving, I can say with certainty that if I were in Alice\u2019s shoes, you would no longer be my friend.  Period.\n\nThat being said, you should STILL apologize and get her one hell of a baby shower gift (passed through a mutual friend) because damn it she deserves it.  You have NO IDEA the anxiety you have likely induced in this poor woman.  My kids are teenagers and I\u2019m having flashbacks to when I would check the toilet paper every time I wiped, and the multiple trips to the ER thinking I was miscarrying, and then the sheer relief seeing their little heartbeats on the screen.  I seriously want to call Alice and comfort her myself.  I feel physically nauseous about this whole situation.\n\nYou acted like an absolute ASS and need to seriously work on yourself, because what you did is NOT okay.", "YTA! That was an awful thing to say to a pregnant woman who was happy to be having a child. After all she'd been through these past 3 years. How incredibly insensitive of you. Apologize, RIGHT AWAY!!", "YTA, not the same as joking about money", "There are lots of jokes that can be made in line with your brand of humor (sleep now! Or, enjoy a clean house now!) or whatever, but yours was too far. Waaaay too far. This was a baby she really wanted. A congratulations was in order first. Then a lighter joke, if it fits your dynamic\n\nYTA", "YTA! Horrible joke for anyone, let alone a friend making the announcement to friends to share & celebrate her joy. Absolutely, YTA!", "YTA.\nWell, well looks like someone\u2019s humor is still in the labor yard-delivering mean jokes left and right! Remember, it's all joy and fun until the joke hits a sensitive spot. Let's hope your comedy skills get a bit more maternity leave, shall we?", "YTA thats not a joke", "YTA holy shit. My jaw literally dropped when I read this. What possible thought process lead you to think this might be OK???", "YTA, jfc, you couldn't have even just started with congrats. Apologize, apologize immediately. Although, I'm not sure you're deserving of being forgiven.", "Wow that was rude and uncalled for. Please don\u2019t make dead baby jokes as well, YTA", "As a parent who miscarried in the process of IVF, you disgust me. It\u2019s a deep fear to lose a pregnancy, especially for people who have tried for 3 years. YTA, read the room.", "What were your real motives behind that 'joke'? \ud83d\ude43 there's no way you thought it would be a good choice to say that.", "YTA. I'm childfree, but I certainly don't think that's an acceptable thing to say to anyone, unless you know they would actually want an abortion. \n\nSaying she'll miss disposable income is one thing, telling you're sorry and will help her end the pregnancy instead of congratulations is just inappropriate even if you think it's just a joke. Her trying for a baby for three years should tell you this is a very big deal and goes beyond your derogatory feelings about children.", "YTA Change the way you joke. It is not funny, cute or endearing. Clearly if a stranger would think it wrong, it is wrong. She has been trying for a baby for 3 years and your response it to get rid of it. That is sick. You might have lost this friend forever. I would not want you around me or my baby.", "YTA - there is a time and a place for joking, and this ain\u2019t it.", "Oooh yeah you're the asshole.\n\nYour friend has been trying to get pregnant for years, and I'm going to assume she probably had really hard days looking at negative tests, and I'm sure there were issues with fertility. Getting pregnant can be easy for some people, but not for everyone. Some people have to get pregnant multiple times before they finally have a successful pregnancy, and I would hate it if that's something your friend went through just to be told *that*.\n\nAlthough we all love a good joke, saying you'll take her to the clinic was extremely tasteless. If she's been trying for three years, you should have understood that joke wasn't cool at all and maybe you should be happy she finally succeeded.\n\nThat being said, it's fine if you want to be childless and she wants to have her own.\n\nAs someone who has lost pregnancy and is childless, I'd have the same reaction if I was her.", "Oof, yeah, YTA. You knew she had been trying for a while, and should have realized making a joke like that wouldn't fly. To her, it's very serious so it doesn't matter what your intention was. \n\nI'd also argue that it's very different than how you joke with each other historically. Joking about no disposable income or a dog being like a kid is very different than joking about... aborting the kid she waiting three years to conceive...", "Definitely YTA. Joking about disposable income is one thing, but joking about going to the clinic after she's been trying to have a baby for three years. Waaaaaay different.", "YTA and failed as a friend.", "YTA and you know it.  I don't see how Alice could ever forgive you - I certainly wouldn't.  Your \"joke\" wasn't, which you also know.  Your behavior is gross.", "YTA if you were my friend I would probably never talk to you again. Trying for 3 years is a long time and you obviously have no clue what she has gone through emotionally and physically to get this baby.", "Ugh, your one of \"those\"\n\n\"It's just a joke. Why are you so mad\"\n\nTo justify any horrible thing you say.\n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nI'm childfree. My closest friend, who I also believed to be childfree, took me to lunch to tell me that she was pregnant. \n\nYou know what I said? \"Is this good news?\". Then, when she confirmed she was happy and keeping the baby, I congratulated her and let her know that I'm there for her. \n\nBecause I'm not a fucking dick. My friend hadn't even been trying for a baby, and I knew that regardless of her intentions before becoming pregnant, that pregnancy changes minds and emotions. You lack empathy.", "YTA. there was so many other jokes you could\u2019ve made that would\u2019ve been funny (\u201cso does this mean I get your drinks?\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see what weird cravings you get\u201d, etc) but you should\u2019ve started with a CONGRATS. this is your friend! Who\u2019s been struggling to get pregnant! Who has lost her children! What is wrong with you?", "YTA\n\nShe's been trying for three years to have a baby and you joke about giving her a ride to get it aborted because that would be funny to.... Who, exactly?\n\nRead the room. The fact you don't already know YTA makes this so much worse. There's no genuine apology you could offer to her that would make this right. If she has any kind of self esteem at all, she's never going to talk to you again.", "YTA. I understand that these types of jokes have been commonplace throughout your friendship, but this was not the time or place to make one. After three full years they\u2019ve finally managed to conceive, she waited three months before getting those she cared about together to break the happy news, and where she wanted congratulations and to be excited with her friends you came in with a proverbial middle finger up. The joke _was_ insensitive and ruined what was supposed to be a special moment.", "YTA. READ THE F*ING ROOM. \n\nMy husband and I have been trying for quite some time now. I have childfree friends. We joke about them making sure they don\u2019t have kids and me trying to have one. But let me tell you one thing I am sure of: the day I tell them I am pregnant, they will be happy for me and congratulate me before anything. And any joke afterwards would be more like \u00ab\u00a0Hope you enjoyed when you had cash and time to sleep\u00a0\u00bb!", "YTA are you genuinely this dense? What is wrong with you?", "YTA. What a sucky, hurtful thing to say to your friend who has been having fertility issues for years. She finally gets pregnant and you say THAT? How is it a joke? Where I come from, jokes are funny\u2026", "You know you don\u2019t have to be a mother to have some empathy and know when things are appropriate or not. You are almost 30. Get a grip\n\nYta", "YTA for a lot of reasons. She has been putting up with your judgmental shit for years and this one broke it. We get it. You don\u2019t want kids. No one cares. Get over judging her for wanting them.", "Wtf? I am an anti natalist. But I would NEVER say something like that to someone who has struggled to have a pregnancy, or anyone really. And then to pretend it\u2019s a joke. No. Jokes are funny, saying something fucked up and edgy that actually HURTS someone you say you care about! Then to pretend it was always a joke, you are an unbelievable ah and a pretty shitty friend. Either that or you are literally thirteen and think just being a dick is the same as a sense of humor. It isn\u2019t. You need to seriously reflect on why you would ever think it\u2019s ok to say something like that and more importantly take responsibility for your shitty behavior. She still may not forgive you (I probably wouldn\u2019t) but you owe her one hell of an apology", "YTA. They\u2019ve been trying for 3 years so idk why you thought this joke would land. That\u2019s an AH joke when it\u2019s obvious that they have wanted and tried for a baby for so long.You\u2019re old enough to judge when you can joke about something or not. Apparently you don\u2019t know that making an abortion joke when someone\u2019s been trying for a baby isn\u2019t a good idea?", "YTA. \n\n\"Haha kids are expensive, I'd rather be the rich auntie!\" is different than \"I'll give you a ride to terminate your very real (and wanted) pregnancy\".  I have a dark and dry sense of humor, but I would never think to say that to someone who has been open about their fertility struggles and is probably scared as hell for the next six months.", "Yta, that's not something to say to someone who has miscarried, her baby died and here you are joking about abortion when she has finally had a successful pregnancy......read the room......", "YTA. Please look at it from her point of view. Three years is a long time to try to conceive. Your joke was not the reaction she was expecting, since she was probably about to burst with happiness. There's a time and place for jokes.", "YTA.  This was a really thoughtless comment.  And it was not a \"joke\" and not funny.  You knew she'd been trying for 3 years to get pregnant.  Of course she was hurt and insulted by your comment.", "YTA.\n\nYou do not \"joke\" about terminating a pregnancy you know was very much wanted and your friend was \"trying for\" for years. You should abjectly and sincerely apologize. That was grotesque, and it's very problematic that you don't understand how painful your \"joke\" was to your friend.", "YTA\n\nSorry, but what in the ever-loving-fuck is wrong with you?", "Dude... the \"I'm so sorry\" wouldn't have been too bad if you had genuinely congratulated her after. Some of us have slightly dark humour. But the \"let me know when you need a ride to the clinic\" part is... sudden satan... \n\nSorry, but that was painful. You knew she was trying for a baby for several years, so you knew how she felt about having children. That's just not a joke you can make. I think you owe your friend an apology.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You basically suggested killing their child who they have so badly wished for years. And most definitely haven't had easy times trying to make it happen.\n\nIf anyone ever under any circumstances threatened my child or suggested abortion during pregnancy even as a bad joke, I would never again speak another word to them.", "YTA. With pregnancy comes major hormonal changes and I think that's something you didn't take into consideration. Prior to my wife getting pregnant, she loved to joke around, but during the time she had hormones flying everywhere, that was a BIG NO NO. I had to learn to understand things change for women in a major way when pregnant and think you may need to do the same.", "Going with YTA.\n\nBased on this being common humor for the two of you, I don't think it was egregiously vile, but since she's been trying for 3 years, you should be aware of the emotional rollercoaster she and her husband have been through.\n\nReach out to her, offer her some ice cream with pickles.  Do  what you can to patch it up.", "[deleted]", "YTA\nSuch a MASSIVE asshole\nAbortion is NEVER an ok topic to joke about with a pregnant woman. Esp one you know has struggled with infertility issues for so long.", "YTA I think the joke was uncalled for since they have been trying for a baby for quite some time", "YTA. Joking about disposable income before someone is pregnant is miles away from jokingingly offering to help her destroy the baby she has been trying to conceive and probably already loves beyond measure.\n\nWtf? Why would you make a joke like that? What could you possibly have to gain? Why could you not have just congratulated her and shared in her joy.", "YTA You know that she wants kids and you know she's been trying for three years, she finally has good news and the first thing out of your mouth is about abortion. What you said is nothing like the previous joking comments you mentioned earlier.", "Ew, YTA and have no sense of social decorum OR how to be a friend.", "YTA. I love when the trash takes itself out. Don't expect your 'friend' to ever talk to you again.", "OMG! What???\n\nYTA", "Too far", "YTA. They were trying for THREE YEARS. Your joke was not appropriate. Her sharing the information was likely, for her, a celebration. Congrats on not being told anything else about her pregnancy, birth, family. How dare you. It's not always about you or making jokes.", "YTA\n\nIf your friend has had multiple miscarriages, aside from the fear of losing the baby, sometimes miscarriages don't just \"take care of themselves\" and you have to go get a dilation and curettage (D&C). Pretty much the same procedure as an abortion. So on top of just generally being a jackass thing to say to someone who's had trouble conceiving, the \"ride to the clinic\" joke may have also brought back memories of the times she *did* have to get a ride to the clinic and get the procedure done after her fetus died.", "YTA \n\nSome things should not be joked about.  You say she has been trying for a baby for the past 3 years, and your response to her announcement is to offer a lift to the clinic?", "Oh dear. Someone needs to grovel to get their friendship back.", "YTA. After 3 years of trying, that comment sucks. We spent 3 years, and while our struggle is no one else\u2019s, that comment would be like a slap in the face.", "YTA they\u2019ve been struggling to get pregnant for 3 years and when they finally get to announce that they are you make a joke about termination you\u2019re a shit friend and that\u2019s not a joke", "Come on OP... you know better. I am 28 and like... everyone has babies now. We are past joking about going to the clinic tbh... It's just not a funny joke because like...  we aren't in college? Infertility issues are exhausting, disappointing, etc. This was the moment where you tear up for her and say you are so happy for her that she has hope for a child that she wanted so badly.", "yta. I\u2019m childfree myself but I would never make a joke like this. Especially given the context of your friend\u2019s struggle to reach this.", "YTA. I\u2019m your age and staunchly child free (I truly do not like children) but I would NEVER react to my friend\u2019s pregnancy announcement by offering them condolences and a ride to the abortion clinic. \n\nThe fact she tried for three years and had multiple miscarriages to get pregnant with this child makes it so, so much worse. You are a shit friend.", "Jesus Christ what is your problem?!! Of course you\u2019re the asshole, she\u2019s been trying for THREE YEARS YTA!!", "YTA.  That's **nowhere** near the caliber of jokes you two have been making.  They've been actively trying and were successful. Congratulations is the only response. Gross.", "YTA\n\nYou were not alone, it was not the time for a joke when she\u2019s announcing a real pregnancy to more than just you for the first time. You heckled her on stage basically.\n\nIt\u2019s an announcement then, you stfu and let the person speak and go with the moment. Just fyi for future, read the room.\n\nSource: I once joked to a bf (read heavy fling) I was pregnant when I had a negative test result - only to find out it was a false negative and I was ACTUALLY pregnant a month later. After breaking up and moving from the guy between the two conversations. We all have those moments the joke couldn\u2019t have been worse timed. Don\u2019t be an AH for longer and just apologise. It happens. Badly sometimes.", "The only response to a pregnancy announcement is \"Congratulations! How do you feel?.\" Never joke about termination, never ask if this is a good or bad thing. Three years, OP, that's more than 1000 days of disappointments, dashed hopes, false starts. I suggest a bouquet of flowers or her favorite food item and a heartfelt apology. Edit: YTA", "bro wtf", "YTA. \"You're going to miss the disposable income\" and \"let me drive you to the clinic to abort your wanted 3 month pregnancy\" are two very different kinds of jokes. It would've been better to earnestly congratulate her and *then* make a *very mild* joke about what's to come if the tone of the gathering allowed at that point. Going straight to the abortion jokes is what makes this asshole-y.", "LOL love this response,  but i'm going to go with YTA because it sounds like getting pregnant was a struggle for your friend i hope you can mend the relationship", " Could be she is a bit more sensitive due to the pregnancy that you didn't realize she would get offended at jokes that she didn't find offensive before. If this is the case, then NTA.", "NTA. But some people do have different senses of humour", "Imma be the one person here and say it NTA\n\nIt isn't really a funny joke, and it all comes down to *how* you said it. But I just can't see why she would react such a way? Maybe I just don't understand the pain of not being able to concieve a child, but personally it was bad, but just not *that* bad", "OP that was an A+ joke. She'll come round eventually.", "NTA, you're friends and this was funny. you obviously didn't mean it in the context of having been her friend and following her journey for three years. Your friend and people on this sub are being super dramatic,  it's super weird she reacted that way tbh. Is she lowkey anti abortion or something?", "YTA\n\nShe and her husband have been trying for 3 years and suffered from miscarriages in the past. This was not the time to make a joke. Just be happy for your friend and offer her support.", "YTA and I think you already know that. You owe her a massive apology if you want any hope of salvaging the relationship.", "YTA - WTF?", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA. There are times for jokes and times for sincere, hearty congratulations. You missed this one big time.", "Yikes not good sorry", "YTA.  What were you thinking?

A bad one. Tasteless.   Shouldn\u2019t have said it. Not in line with proper tone. Absolutely the wrong emotion at the wrong time. But to get angry, have a tantrum, and continue to be angry is nuts. People defending the friend sound insufferable. ESH", "Nah shes annoying youre ok", "Funny joke if the crowd is right and there'd been no fertility issues. YTA though given your friend's struggles.

I can't have kids so that \"joke\" really cuts me but I haven't really shown the other person, they most probably think we have \"joked\" together. Maybe that makes me fake or whatever but I just don't want to make the situation uncomfortable by saying \"well I can't..\" or flying off the handle at them saying something like do you know how lucky I think you are!?!?
