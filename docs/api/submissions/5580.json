Yeet him out. NTA\n\nSome people are going tk say, \"you couldve been nicer\". \n\nIf it was 8:04pm, right as im closing my door? Oh, \"sorry dear, we're closed, computers already shut down!\" \n\nBut when someone has to manually open a set of doors that have NO handle? A half hour after closing? How do i know your not robbing me? Here to ransack the store? \n\nI dont owe you the risk to my saftey for the sake of being 'nice'. If he had been 'nice', he never wouldve come into the doors. NTA Op, and stand your ground. \n\nIts 2022, and \"the customer is always right\" is dead, because it shouldve died a long time ago. Good luck Op, stay safe.", "NTA\n\nAnyone saying otherwise has never worked retail and doesn't understand how often people do dumb shit like that and then try to play dumb if they get called out.", "NTA\n\nI work retail.\n\nAt 30 minutes past closed with gate half down and doors off on a holiday that was an extremely polite response.\n\nHe knew damn well you were closed but thought his wants were more important than your needs.", "NTA because anyone who pries doors open and ducks under a security gate is a potential threat to your employees. Anyone who goes to such lengths is either desperate or doesn\u2019t have good intentions and either way, you did the right thing making him leave.", "NTA, there's no way he thought you were still open if the shutter was half way down and doors disabled. Most likely thought if he gets in he'll have to be served and played innocent when called out.", "NTA. Seriously people... I was working in retail for years. Made me hate people.", "NTA, and customer service only applies to CUSTOMERS.  After closing hours NO ONE is a customer, they are TRESPASSERS.", "NTA that's a scary situation to be in and you should have yelled.", "I think your family was being sarcastic. Nta.", "NTA he was counting on you being \"nice\" so that he could do what he wanted. Good on you for shutting that shit down.", "NTA. He knew you were closed. He was hoping you\u2019d be desperate for a sale or take pity on him.", "NTA\n\nI don't believe for a second that he thought you were open. If you had been anything less then firm, he'd have tried to keep on pushing with claims like \"oh I just need to get one thing!\" while trying to walk past you.", "NTA. There\u2019s a special place in hell for people that show up at closing time to shop. Sure, he probably didn\u2019t bother to check the holiday hours first but the gate and door were clues enough. Retail is rough. Merry Christmas!", "NTA. Even if the guy was simply oblivious, a person lacking the basic awareness it takes to function in civil society is deservedly TA in this type of scenario.\n\nProbably in his version of the story, there were no signs, the doors were fully open, you lowered the gate while he was standing there and yelled at him to never come back.", "NTA.", "NTA. The entitlement of some people. Jeez.", "As someone who works in customer service,  F that dude. He knew what he was doing and thought he could get away with it. NTA", "Fuuuuuck no, NTA. More customers should be treated like idiots when they're acting like idiots.", "NTA for kicking him out when you're obviously closed.\n\nYour family is kinda right, you could have worded it better.  But a part of me is also thinking this guy doesn't really respond to hints very well.\n\nYou were probably just speaking out of extreme annoyance that someone would be that clueless and forceful.", "YTA You don't owe him time or service when the store is closed. But you do owe him basic courtesy. The correct response here was \"Sorry, we're closed. We closed early because of the holiday.\" But you went straight to angry, implied he was an idiot, and lost a customer.", "NTA.  If every retail worker called out asshole behavior like this it would die off pretty fast.\n\nGood job!", "YTA - though it is understood that it's a stressful season and everybody wants to go home.\n\nSome things to consider in the future.  Maybe he hadn't looked online.  Maybe he hadn't called.  Maybe he didn't notice the hours sign.  Is that your fault? No, it is his but that doesn't make it intentional or vindictive.  People sometimes autopilot their way through life, with no intention to harm or inconvenience others, and no real understanding when they are.  Again, not your fault, but not necessarily in need of aggression either.  That being said, maybe he was testing the possibility of stealing something or even robbing you.\n\nDo you own this store, or are you a manager or shift supervisor?  If the former, how would you handle a subordinate speaking to a customer in the same manner, in the same circumstances?  If the latter, how would they have expected you to handle it?    \n\nUltimately, it strikes me that you could not have simply left him to wander the store, but did you need to challenge him in the manner you did?  Could the same result have been accomplished with a different approach, possibly an invitation to come as soon as you are next open, etc?   I suspect you've already been going through all the possible alternatives, so the trick is keeping them in mind and taking that second to force your temper down, the next time, while still being alert in the event of malevolent intentions.  So while YTA this time, it doesn't mean YTA all the time, or that you need to beat yourself up over it.  \n\nAs I'm not greatly familiar with all the fire codes, can the \"safety reasons\" door be changed to one that is open from inside but not from outside, legally?", "Your family is right. It doesn't take much to treat people with respect and consideration. \n\nHe might not be able to read, he could be desperate, he could be on the spectrum. \n\nThe reason doesn't matter. It wouldn't have hurt you to say \"Sorry, we're closing early. Enjoy the holidays\". Instead you lost a customer and whomever he decides to tell.", "YTA there was no reason to initiate aggressively. If he had refused to leave, yeah, then be aggressive, but not right off the bat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do feel I may have reacted more with the worry of bad intentions. I understand he may not have seen the sign or had internet access, etc. In my head, the gate and non auto doors should have been enough. I don't own the company, I'm a manager. Truthfully, I am 99.9 percent of the time super nice to people, but when intentions are unclear, I will protect my people. So I probably overreacted a bit. \nI'm not sure about the door thing. I just know we have to have a door not locked to make sure we can more easily escape a fire if needed.", "So, uh, his desperation makes it acceptable to force his way through a closed entryway? Or maybe his illiteracy means he's too generally stupid to realize that a closed entryway means that the location is closed for business? Or, he's on the spectrum in such a way that gives him the capacity to respond to an altercation in a rather nuerotypical manner but be UTTERLY STYMIED by the implications of a closed shutter! All these possibilities! But y'know what's much more likely? Some asshat figured that if he could get into the store, they wouldn't dare kick him out without getting him what he wanted, and so he got a deserved firm refusal from the proprietor.

Like someone else mentioned, he is half likely to be there to rob you or contemplating a grab and run. There is no charitable excuse that paints him in a reasonable light. Either an entitled AH (best case) but he may well be trying to rip off the store, hold up staff for personal belongings, or commit sexual assault. If you don\u2019t want bad things to happen, you\u2019d best convince him that you\u2019re not a soft target", "I have worked in stores, where the doors were off and the gate was partially down, 30 min prior to close, every night. Those stores exist.", "Do not listen to this person, they sound like they would do the same stupid shit and are defending the AH who broke into your store after you closed. NTA. You could have screamed at the dude and most would still think you\u2019re in the right. Its absolutely a safety issue.", "I am fully aware people have different circumstances... maybe you could realize the same, though. Not everyone celebrates Christmas. I dont, but I'll still wish a happy Christmas to people. It also has nothing to do with some random guy in his 60s prying open a door to a business when it is pretty well known that if a door is automatic and doesn't open, it means the place is closed.", "Ok. How about 30 minutes after closing?", "Closed and gone.  Why do you think they  were prepped before closing?", "NTA, fuck\u2019s sake. Just yesterday I was worried the grocery store would be closed for Christmas Eve, lights were on but I triple checked the times on the front. \n\nIt was 3PM, and repeatedly checking confirmed they were open till 6. \n\nWith the security gate even partially down, and the automatic does shuttered, a sane human being wouldn\u2019t think for a second the shop is genuinely open, this is just main character syndrome, and they can *all* fuck off so can the US mantra that the customer is always right, the customer is a moron and can fuck off.", "NTA\n\nWhen the bakery I work at moved into a new space and we were setting it up, a guy walked in and asked if we were open.\n\nThere were sheets of drywall, ladders, an amazing amount of dust and boxes EVERYWHERE.\n\nCustomers are often remarkably thick and sometimes you just gotta get their attention.", "NTA. I had a job in HS at a grocery store. We closed at 6 but it was Christmas Eve and the lines were long. All the cashier's finished cleaning our areas just as this huge group did the same thing and pried the doors open. Our manager at the time Jeff literally herded them right back out the door like a sheep dog. \n\nThey weren't customers. You can't have customers if you're closed. Fuck customer service outside your specific hours of working. It's absolutely goofy to think you should be \"on the clock\" 24 7.", "So, he broke in, plain and simple.  He's lucky all you did was give him a stern talking to.  I would've called police.  Then again, I'm not all that nice of a person.  But you're NTA.", "After working 20+ years of retail: NTA. At all. The days of the \"oblivious\" customer need to end.", "NTA. I used to work retail too and would have people bang and try to push on our doors to get in after closing. Our hours would be posted in LARGE BOLD PRINT on the front door and they still won't read it. Some (most in the towns I've worked in) weren't taught proper courtesy of checking store hours before attempting to walk in. I have been out of retail for 2 years now and I still have nightmares of people trying to shop when the doors are closed.
