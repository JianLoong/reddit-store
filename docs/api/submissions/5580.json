Anyone who goes to such lengths is either desperate or doesn\u2019t have good intentions and either way, you did the right thing making him leave.", "NTA, there's no way he thought you were still open if the shutter was half way down and doors disabled.

Nta.", "NTA he was counting on you being \"nice\" so that he could do what he wanted. Good on you for shutting that shit down.", "NTA. He knew you were closed. He was hoping you\u2019d be desperate for a sale or take pity on him.", "NTA\n\nI don't believe for a second that he thought you were open.

Maybe he hadn't looked online.  Maybe he hadn't called.  Maybe he didn't notice the hours sign.  Is that your fault? No, it is his but that doesn't make it intentional or vindictive.  People sometimes autopilot their way through life, with no intention to harm or inconvenience others, and no real understanding when they are.  Again, not your fault, but not necessarily in need of aggression either.  That being said, maybe he was testing the possibility of stealing something or even robbing you.\n\nDo you own this store, or are you a manager or shift supervisor?  If the former, how would you handle a subordinate speaking to a customer in the same manner, in the same circumstances?  If the latter, how would they have expected you to handle it?    \n\nUltimately, it strikes me that you could not have simply left him to wander the store, but did you need to challenge him in the manner you did?  Could the same result have been accomplished with a different approach, possibly an invitation to come as soon as you are next open, etc?   I suspect you've already been going through all the possible alternatives, so the trick is keeping them in mind and taking that second to force your temper down, the next time, while still being alert in the event of malevolent intentions.  So while YTA this time, it doesn't mean YTA all the time, or that you need to beat yourself up over it.  \n\nAs I'm not greatly familiar with all the fire codes, can the \"safety reasons\" door be changed to one that is open from inside but not from outside, legally?", "Your family is right. It doesn't take much to treat people with respect and consideration. \n\nHe might not be able to read, he could be desperate, he could be on the spectrum. \n\nThe reason doesn't matter. It wouldn't have hurt you to say \"Sorry, we're closing early. Enjoy the holidays\". Instead you lost a customer and whomever he decides to tell.", "YTA there was no reason to initiate aggressively.

Not really clear on what 'prying' an automatic door means. The safety gate being halfway down would be a clear indicator to any sane person that the store is closed, especially if most of the lights are off. AKA any court would find him guilty of trespassing if it ever came up, because any sane person would understand the place is closed.  \n\n\nAlso might wanna consider some smaller form of interior lock to temporarily keep the doors locked but easily escapable if you need one unlocked for safety. Just a simple twist lock for a door while occupied, with a key hole on the exterior (or none, depending), then put whatever the main lock is on when you leave.  \n\n\nAlso of note: A local restaurant had a \"door must remain unlocked during occupancy\" sign on the main entry for years, then it got changed to \"during business hours\", presumably because the fire Marshall or someone realized they'd be creating a theft/robbery opportunity requiring it to be unlocked after hours when a lone manager or someone is there.", "I was working at McDonald's and there had been a flood in the store, so the crew and I left the store to wait in the drive thru. It was about 8 of us sitting in and blocking the drive thru, which should have been enough, but to drive the point home that we were closed I propped up a pallet to block the entryway.\n\nThis should have been super clear that maybe, idk, we were closed or something, but in two separate instances someone left their car to MOVE THE PALLET BLOCKADE I had e-rected-uh.

I had a zoom meeting once, so door closed with Zoom notice on door to not disturb, and name sign hanging out there. Someone still opened the door without knocking saying they have a 10am with Kathy.

A man trespassed onto private premises, and when I initially asked him to leave, he argued with me, and that\u2019s when I told him to get the fuck out. Was it aggressive? Yeah, a little bit, and why shouldn\u2019t it have been? He\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t call mall security right then and there.

It smelled like rubber was burning right next to the surge protectors. We decided to close early because we didn\u2019t know what was going on and we didn\u2019t want us or the customers to be in there if a fire actually ignited. \n\nAnyways, while we were turning off the electricity, this girl comes to the front of the store which is already locked. She had walked by earlier and saw something she liked on a mannequin in the window and came back to buy it and look in the store. \n\nI went out of my way to ring her up outside the store for the one item, but she\u2019s pushing back on why she can\u2019t enter the store. I explained to her that we smelled burning rubber and were concerned about a fire. She said \u201cthat\u2019s a weird reason to close a store\u201d. Anyways, I was perfectly nice as she argued with me about how she should be allowed to come in and shop with all the lights off as we wait to see if the store catches on fire. After she left, I walked inside and told the other staff that there was going to be a negative yelp review. They didn\u2019t believe me because they knew I\u2019d gone out of my way to help, and also because generally I was known for being extremely friendly to customers. \n\nSure enough, I got home and the manager texts me that I was right. She wrote the most asinine review I\u2019d ever seen and just straight up omitted crucial information. For example, she said \u201cThe lady came out and told me the store closed early because it smelled like rubber.\u201d No, it\u2019s because it smelled like *burning* rubber. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the workers were allowed to stay in the store but I couldn\u2019t go.\u201d Because we were in there turning off all the appliances before evacuating. \n\nAnyways, my point is I agree with you, you can go out of your way to accommodate someone but they\u2019ll call you rude for saying no to them.", "\"Sorry you were inconvenienced by our potential electrical fire hazard. We prefer to roast our clientele with humor rather than flames.\"", "\u201cWe would hope that if you smelled burning rubber in your home, you would know to evacuate.\u201d", "This reminded me that in German, a person in a store is a customer, but a person in a restaurant is usually a guest (think guesthouse).
