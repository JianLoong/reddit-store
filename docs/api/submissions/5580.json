Anyone who goes to such lengths is either desperate or doesn\u2019t have good intentions and either way, you did the right thing making him leave.", "NTA, there's no way he thought you were still open if the shutter was half way down and doors disabled.

Nta.", "NTA he was counting on you being \"nice\" so that he could do what he wanted. Good on you for shutting that shit down.", "NTA. He knew you were closed. He was hoping you\u2019d be desperate for a sale or take pity on him.", "NTA\n\nI don't believe for a second that he thought you were open.

Maybe he hadn't looked online.  Maybe he hadn't called.  Maybe he didn't notice the hours sign.  Is that your fault? No, it is his but that doesn't make it intentional or vindictive.  People sometimes autopilot their way through life, with no intention to harm or inconvenience others, and no real understanding when they are.  Again, not your fault, but not necessarily in need of aggression either.  That being said, maybe he was testing the possibility of stealing something or even robbing you.\n\nDo you own this store, or are you a manager or shift supervisor?  If the former, how would you handle a subordinate speaking to a customer in the same manner, in the same circumstances?  If the latter, how would they have expected you to handle it?    \n\nUltimately, it strikes me that you could not have simply left him to wander the store, but did you need to challenge him in the manner you did?  Could the same result have been accomplished with a different approach, possibly an invitation to come as soon as you are next open, etc?   I suspect you've already been going through all the possible alternatives, so the trick is keeping them in mind and taking that second to force your temper down, the next time, while still being alert in the event of malevolent intentions.  So while YTA this time, it doesn't mean YTA all the time, or that you need to beat yourself up over it.  \n\nAs I'm not greatly familiar with all the fire codes, can the \"safety reasons\" door be changed to one that is open from inside but not from outside, legally?", "Your family is right. It doesn't take much to treat people with respect and consideration. \n\nHe might not be able to read, he could be desperate, he could be on the spectrum. \n\nThe reason doesn't matter. It wouldn't have hurt you to say \"Sorry, we're closing early. Enjoy the holidays\". Instead you lost a customer and whomever he decides to tell.", "YTA there was no reason to initiate aggressively.

Why people continue to line up when the gate is halfway down will never make sense to me.\n\nAlso, the fact that we have to have multiple police officers at the doors when we close the store (Walmart super center) every Christmas eve tells you everything you need to know about this situation.

Not really clear on what 'prying' an automatic door means. The safety gate being halfway down would be a clear indicator to any sane person that the store is closed, especially if most of the lights are off. AKA any court would find him guilty of trespassing if it ever came up, because any sane person would understand the place is closed.  \n\n\nAlso might wanna consider some smaller form of interior lock to temporarily keep the doors locked but easily escapable if you need one unlocked for safety. Just a simple twist lock for a door while occupied, with a key hole on the exterior (or none, depending), then put whatever the main lock is on when you leave.  \n\n\nAlso of note: A local restaurant had a \"door must remain unlocked during occupancy\" sign on the main entry for years, then it got changed to \"during business hours\", presumably because the fire Marshall or someone realized they'd be creating a theft/robbery opportunity requiring it to be unlocked after hours when a lone manager or someone is there.", "I was working at McDonald's and there had been a flood in the store, so the crew and I left the store to wait in the drive thru. It was about 8 of us sitting in and blocking the drive thru, which should have been enough, but to drive the point home that we were closed I propped up a pallet to block the entryway.\n\nThis should have been super clear that maybe, idk, we were closed or something, but in two separate instances someone left their car to MOVE THE PALLET BLOCKADE I had e-rected-uh.

There are too many customers who quote the phrase just so that they can abuse staff.", "Could you even have sold him something? Back when I worked retail when we closed and counted the drawers,  we had a sequence and once it was activated it took like 20 minutes to complete and once that closing sequence on the registers was initiated,  you couldn't stop it.  I had one broad who rolled up to my store 10 minutes after close demanding to be let in.  I told her we were closed and she was yelling at me through the door telling me my clock was wrong (it wasn't) and that I was horrible and ruined her Christmas (maybe so,  but you had from 8 am  until 9 pm to get here and you didn't). But the register was already in the closing sequence, and I literally could not sell her anything.  Anyhow, NTA.", "Tell your family that customer service is only available when the store is open. Also tell them to piss off from me.", "I was just fired from a high profile tech retail company for the same scenario but the \u201ccustomer\u201d in question wasn\u2019t even in earshot.

No customer service necessary. Worked retail for over a decade. customer service starts and ends with operating hours. after you close or before you open they can fuck right off.", "NTA. Have people no consideration for store hours and employees on Christmas Eve? Abhorrent!", "NTA I\u2019d be scared he was coming in to rob the store, and it\u2019s dangerous being there alone when someone tries to force their way in after hours. \n\nCustomer service does not matter in a situation that your scared for your safety. Who seriously thinks it\u2019s okay to go under the security door, we all know that means the store is closed.", "NTA, do your last minute holiday shopping on someone else\u2019s time LMFAO.

It used to be my job at Asda (UK Walmart) to stand on the door half an hour before we closed to let people know we were closing early on Christmas Eve. Ten minutes before we closed, no trolleys were allowed in. As soon as we closed, the doors got taken off automatic and only reopened to let people out.\n\nPeople forget that retail workers have homes to go to too.", "NTA people now a days are self-entitled and can't read. Our building has the hours clearly posted on the front door and online. Yet every morning I'll have someone yank on the door trying to open it early same with after we close.

Yes when I inform people they need to put them on I get told all the time I didn't see a sign that that said we need masks.", "NTA - some people live in their own world of entitlement. I used to work retail, many years ago. We would work late Christmas Eve marking stuff down for the after Christmas sales, and I can not begin to tell you how many people would walk up to the gates of the store (and we were in a mall that closed early, so ALL of the stores were closed) and demand we open them. I remember one time we had one guy begging us to get that one thing for his wife, he knew exactly where it was and he would pay us extra for it. He was practically in tears. He just didn\u2019t understand that the register systems were closed, inventory would count that item as gone, therefore his \u201cbribe\u201d wouldn\u2019t get him anywhere. And, why the hell did he wait until 7pm on Christmas Eve to try and get that one thing his wife desperately wanted?? \n\nWorking retail honestly can suck the life out of you, but it also teaches you to treat fellow retail workers better when you are the customer.

No, you did right.", "NTA - people are stupid and inconsiderate when it come to shop hours. I have a story identical to yours from 40 YEARS AGO.
