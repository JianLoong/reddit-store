Anyone who goes to such lengths is either desperate or doesn\u2019t have good intentions and either way, you did the right thing making him leave.", "NTA, there's no way he thought you were still open if the shutter was half way down and doors disabled. Most likely thought if he gets in he'll have to be served and played innocent when called out.", "NTA. Seriously people... I was working in retail for years. Made me hate people.", "NTA, and customer service only applies to CUSTOMERS.  After closing hours NO ONE is a customer, they are TRESPASSERS.", "NTA that's a scary situation to be in and you should have yelled.", "I think your family was being sarcastic. Nta.", "NTA he was counting on you being \"nice\" so that he could do what he wanted. Good on you for shutting that shit down.", "NTA. He knew you were closed. He was hoping you\u2019d be desperate for a sale or take pity on him.", "NTA\n\nI don't believe for a second that he thought you were open. If you had been anything less then firm, he'd have tried to keep on pushing with claims like \"oh I just need to get one thing!\" while trying to walk past you.", "NTA. There\u2019s a special place in hell for people that show up at closing time to shop. Sure, he probably didn\u2019t bother to check the holiday hours first but the gate and door were clues enough. Retail is rough. Merry Christmas!", "NTA. Even if the guy was simply oblivious, a person lacking the basic awareness it takes to function in civil society is deservedly TA in this type of scenario.\n\nProbably in his version of the story, there were no signs, the doors were fully open, you lowered the gate while he was standing there and yelled at him to never come back.", "NTA.", "NTA.

But a part of me is also thinking this guy doesn't really respond to hints very well.\n\nYou were probably just speaking out of extreme annoyance that someone would be that clueless and forceful.", "YTA You don't owe him time or service when the store is closed. But you do owe him basic courtesy. The correct response here was \"Sorry, we're closed. We closed early because of the holiday.\" But you went straight to angry, implied he was an idiot, and lost a customer.", "NTA.  If every retail worker called out asshole behavior like this it would die off pretty fast.\n\nGood job!", "YTA - though it is understood that it's a stressful season and everybody wants to go home.\n\nSome things to consider in the future.  Maybe he hadn't looked online.  Maybe he hadn't called.  Maybe he didn't notice the hours sign.  Is that your fault? No, it is his but that doesn't make it intentional or vindictive.  People sometimes autopilot their way through life, with no intention to harm or inconvenience others, and no real understanding when they are.  Again, not your fault, but not necessarily in need of aggression either.  That being said, maybe he was testing the possibility of stealing something or even robbing you.\n\nDo you own this store, or are you a manager or shift supervisor?  If the former, how would you handle a subordinate speaking to a customer in the same manner, in the same circumstances?  If the latter, how would they have expected you to handle it?    \n\nUltimately, it strikes me that you could not have simply left him to wander the store, but did you need to challenge him in the manner you did?  Could the same result have been accomplished with a different approach, possibly an invitation to come as soon as you are next open, etc?   I suspect you've already been going through all the possible alternatives, so the trick is keeping them in mind and taking that second to force your temper down, the next time, while still being alert in the event of malevolent intentions.  So while YTA this time, it doesn't mean YTA all the time, or that you need to beat yourself up over it.  \n\nAs I'm not greatly familiar with all the fire codes, can the \"safety reasons\" door be changed to one that is open from inside but not from outside, legally?", "Your family is right. It doesn't take much to treat people with respect and consideration. \n\nHe might not be able to read, he could be desperate, he could be on the spectrum. \n\nThe reason doesn't matter. It wouldn't have hurt you to say \"Sorry, we're closing early. Enjoy the holidays\". Instead you lost a customer and whomever he decides to tell.", "YTA there was no reason to initiate aggressively.

I do feel I may have reacted more with the worry of bad intentions.

I had a job in HS at a grocery store. We closed at 6 but it was Christmas Eve and the lines were long. All the cashier's finished cleaning our areas just as this huge group did the same thing and pried the doors open. Our manager at the time Jeff literally herded them right back out the door like a sheep dog. \n\nThey weren't customers. You can't have customers if you're closed. Fuck customer service outside your specific hours of working. It's absolutely goofy to think you should be \"on the clock\" 24 7.", "So, he broke in, plain and simple.

At closing time, the person at the door would stop anyone else from entering (\"but there are still people in there.\" \"They are just finishing up now\") and another would sweep people to the tills.

NTA. The pharmacy I work at closes for lunch every day and shuts down at regular closing times in the evenings. Why people continue to line up when the gate is halfway down will never make sense to me.\n\nAlso, the fact that we have to have multiple police officers at the doors when we close the store (Walmart super center) every Christmas eve tells you everything you need to know about this situation. Very stern announcements were going over the PA system last night literally every minute in the last ten minutes, and there were people still casually roaming the store, sniffing candles and wax melts.", "Well, one of you was the asshole, but you've got nothing to worry about.", "NTA!!!!", "NTA, your family are morons if they're serious.  \nPeople get pissed because they feel entitled; it can suck when someone's in an emergency and you have to reject them (everyone gets the same treatment where I work, regardless of reason, to avoid legal suits of \"Well they just did it because X!\" shit).  \n\n\nIDK about the automatic doors or how they work, but it's plausible someone thought they were busted. Not really clear on what 'prying' an automatic door means. The safety gate being halfway down would be a clear indicator to any sane person that the store is closed, especially if most of the lights are off. AKA any court would find him guilty of trespassing if it ever came up, because any sane person would understand the place is closed.  \n\n\nAlso might wanna consider some smaller form of interior lock to temporarily keep the doors locked but easily escapable if you need one unlocked for safety. Just a simple twist lock for a door while occupied, with a key hole on the exterior (or none, depending), then put whatever the main lock is on when you leave.  \n\n\nAlso of note: A local restaurant had a \"door must remain unlocked during occupancy\" sign on the main entry for years, then it got changed to \"during business hours\", presumably because the fire Marshall or someone realized they'd be creating a theft/robbery opportunity requiring it to be unlocked after hours when a lone manager or someone is there.", "I was working at McDonald's and there had been a flood in the store, so the crew and I left the store to wait in the drive thru. It was about 8 of us sitting in and blocking the drive thru, which should have been enough, but to drive the point home that we were closed I propped up a pallet to block the entryway.\n\nThis should have been super clear that maybe, idk, we were closed or something, but in two separate instances someone left their car to MOVE THE PALLET BLOCKADE I had e-rected-uh. Both times I simply walked up as they reentered there car and replaced the pallet. I didn't even look at them to shame them or anything, but in my mind I was losing it.... Just how?", "NTA that guy was being a dofus, why does he think saying he won't be back is a threat?  You mean I don't have to deal with you ever again?  Great!  Bon voyage!", "NTA. You did the absolute right thing. He may not have been there to \u201cshop\u201d and your no nonsense approach to him made the customer (potential felon) back off. Good on you.", "NTA.

There is just no way that you cannot see a closed gate and have to physically open an automatic door and think \u201cyeah, this place is open for business.\u201d Sometimes people see lights on and figure we need to cater to them because we\u2019re still working\u2026like yeah, working on getting the hell home!\n\nScrew nice. You do not need to supply \u201cgood customer service\u201d when your actual safety is at risk. Technically, he broke into your store past closing hours. There were no people other than a handful of workers trying to clean up and get out. It was not safe.\n\nPersonally, I would make sure that the cameras were on and got the interaction (do they have sound as well?) because there is a good chance that the guy will call customer service and be nasty and it could come back to you in a negative way. Report the situation to your superior, and get your coworkers to do the same if they saw/heard.

I wasn't on shift, but we had our secret santa gift exchange from 1:45-2:15.

I just wanna go home!\"", "NTA I've had this customer interaction several times.  It was beyond obvious that I was closing up shop every time.  Once I even put a huge sign outside covering the door handle and I still had customers come inside.\n\nAnd every time, they attempted to blame me for their mistake. \n\nEventually,  I just asked them why they were trespassing.
