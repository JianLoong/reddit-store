We have this one girl in our group, Sadie (27 F). She has a disability that is mostly manageable through medication. \nDespite this, Sadie has a bad habit of \u2018forgetting\u2019 to take her pills right before we do something she isn\u2019t interested in doing. This time, it was on a group trip we\u2019ve been planning for over a year. Due to how high the cost of the trip was, we each decided to take a day and plan an activity that the whole group would participate in. We also rented a van together to get to our destination as that was the most ideal situation. \n\nThe first issue with Sadie came up when getting to our destination. Due to the length of the drive, everyone was going to be driving an hour to get to our destination. Right before it was Sadie\u2019s turn, she had a flare up, and could not drive. Our friend took over. \n\nThe next morning, my friend had planned a tour of the town. We all reminded Sadie several times to take her medication as this was an expensive tour and we did not want it to be cut short. Well, she had forgotten and the tour had to be cut short. This is when I got genuinely upset because this was now my money being wasted.\n\nThroughout the week, she had flare ups pretty often.The actual fight that led to this post occurred on my day though. The previous day, Sadie had had no flare ups. (It was also her day to plan). This was because she had set alarms to take her medication regularly so that she would be ok. We all reminded her to please take her pills like that again.\n\nI decided to take all my friends on a trail ride on horses as the trails in this town are known for being absolutely beautiful. We paid extra for a basics lesson prior to the trail. In the basics lesson, we were all paired off based on experience and performance in the small arena that they had. I was paired with Sadie.\n\nWell, 1/4th of the way through the trail, she started having a flare up. I told her that I would not be turning around as this was expensive and that I was truly looking forward to this. She begged me to turn around. Finally, the ranger told us that I had to turn around with her as she was my partner.\n\nIn the car, I told her that she knew how important this was to me and that she just should\u2019ve taken the pills. She told me that I was being ableist and that I didn\u2019t know what the pills did to her. We got into a huge argument in which I said \u201cif your disability can\u2019t take being a good friend, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t come on these trips anyway.\u201d\n\nWhile I agree that it was harsh, I didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong considering that she had cost us so much money over the years for simply not wanting to do something. My other friends agree that Sadie is inconvenient at times but that I should\u2019ve been more sensitive to her condition. I\u2019m honestly torn on whether to apologize or not.\n\nEdit: After reading almost every comment, I spoke to Sadie on the phone and apologized for the harshness of my tone. I tried to ask for more details on the medication she takes and her condition in general, but she said that she doesn\u2019t share any of that information with anyone but her closest friends as the symptoms can sometimes be embarrassing. I completely understood this and did not push further. We\u2019ve decided to go out to lunch together on Friday so I can understand a little bit more about her condition and how it affects her.

I also have a health condition that can flare up, and while I'm not sure whats up with Sadie, if she doesn't want to take her meds, then she knows she needs to stay home. She was able to keep on top them of for her day, but no one else's?  And just happens to flare up before her turn to drive? Were there any other flares on the drive, or just when it was her turn?", "NTA. If Sadie had flare ups that messed up her own day, then the problems on the other days are understandable. The fact that she's problem-free when she's doing something *she* wants implies you're being manipulated.\n\nShe's messing up the planned activities and costing you money. You deserve to be able to take a trip without that one person causing most of the problems.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. Yes, you could\u2019ve phrased it better, but I get the frustration. \n\nI have a chronic condition/disability which \u201cflares up\u201d and at some times, it\u2019s worse than others, some times it\u2019s better. The pain can be intolerable at times, but the meds that stop that have to be taken consistently without pause, mean I don\u2019t know what day of the week it is. So I stopped taking them - and manage it with lesser drugs when it flares up. \n\nBut I also manage it and my limitations. If I know something is likely to cause issues. I don\u2019t do it. I\u2019m also VERY honest about my condition and the impact it can have on people BEFORE booking trips away. If I don\u2019t feel I can manage something, I don\u2019t do it. Simple as. My inability to be able to do something shouldn\u2019t prevent others. \n\nFact that friend can take and set reminders for meds when she wants to do what she wants to do is incredibly selfish. And not regulating her meds is quite likely one of the issues causing more severe side effects if this is the case as the body hasn\u2019t had time to adjust. Most drugs taken to manage longer terms issues (e.g. something like MS) have to be ramped up slowly over a number of days and then maintained. They\u2019re not drugs to take as and when felt like. This causes more problems in the long run.", "Nta. Sadie is intentionally sabotaging your trip. I wouldn\u2019t invite her to the next one.", "NTA. Sadie has repeatedly refused to take responsibility for her disability by not taking her medication. This invariably makes her ill and she knows that. Therefore she becomes a liability to her friends. She is in fact a disloyal friend. You were not at all out of line for being upset with her, when she wanted to cut the trip short. It would be better if she didn't come on these trips as long as she doesn't want to manage her disability. I don't know what her disability is or how her medicine would affect her negatively, but surely these \"flareups\" don't do her any good either?", "NTA\n\nIt does sound like she is using her condition as an excuse. In the future I would reconsider asking her to participate unless her participation had no effect on mine, and she understands that she will have to amuse herself while you continue with your activities. I would also schedule her hour of driving at the beginning and her choice of activity at the end of the trip.\n\nIf she is intentionally choosing not to take medication, that choice is hers, but so are the consequences of waiting for all of you while you continue as planned and/or not being invited to join trips at all. It is sad that she has to deal with a medical condition but that\u2019s her reality.", "NTA seems like she\u2019s ruining things almost purposefully", "NTA\n\nWhat ist so difficult in setting an alarm multiple times a day?\n\nMy daughter has an illness that requires her to take meds on time 4 times a day. She uses her mobile for alarms.\n\nIf you have a chronic illness and do nothing to ensure you take your meds... I simply cannot understand this!", "NTA I wouldn't travel with ehr either", "Nta - as someone who is also disabled and unable to do certain things, I would just not go so as to not hold the group back. I think it\u2019s telling that she let slip that it\u2019s not that she \u201cforgets\u201d but \u201cyou don\u2019t know what the pills do to her\u201d. That right there. She doesn\u2019t like one of the side effects but isn\u2019t being honest about it until pressed.", "NTA, sounds like she just doesn\u2019t want to do what she is not interested and she\u2019s using her disability as an excuse.

Just stop inviting her.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is using y\u2019all like toilet paper. Kick her to the curb. She\u2019s a leech.", "As someone who has had to take medication daily for 30 years, or the consequences are devastating, NTA.\n\nIt is incumbent upon Sadie to take her meds. If her medical infirmities are real, then that medication is necessary and she shouldn't be skipping or delaying doses, as that is even harder on the body. Shame on her for using her physical problems to manipulate people she claims are friends.", "NTA\n\nSadie sabotaged your day by not taking her meds and she knew it. She could have just stayed back if she didn\u2019t want to take them, it was her choice. She chose to not take the meds knowing full well that she would not be able to make it to the end of the trail. And then accuses you of being ableist as a cover for her poor behavior. \n\nSadie needs to grow up and take responsibility for how her choices impact her friends and herself.", "NTA I have to take many medications daily and some days I really don't feel like it..but I do it anyway cause it would adversely affect me and the people around me if I didn't.", "INFO: Why does she not take her medicine daily; what did she mean when she said you didn\u2019t understand what the meds do to her?\n\nEdited to add judgement: With some reluctance, NTA. OP doesn\u2019t come across as being a very kind person to someone in her \u201cpretty close group of friends\u201d but at the end of the day, it\u2019s Sadie\u2019s job to manage her conditions.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what type of condition she has but it seems wildly suspicious that she would forget to take her medication on days when there are activities she might not want to do. And the fact that it hurt everyone else\u2019s experience is even worse. She needs to be responsible for her health or remove herself from the group events. \n\nIf her condition wasn\u2019t under her control then I would have voted differently but since she just didn\u2019t take medicine she knows she needs, it is 100% her fault.", "NTA\n\nThis may sound harsh, but it sounds to me like Sadie's plan for your vacation was that the rest of you forgo your activities to concentrate on her.", "NTA. The trip was planned well in advance and Sadie knew what she was signing up for. It's her responsibility to take her meds when necessary to avoid her own discomfort and your inconvenience. I am disabled and take medication, and if I know I'll be doing something where I'll be pushing myself, I make sure to take/have those meds on hand to avoid disrupting the people I'm with. Plus, I don't want to be in pain.\n\nHowever, your wording was harsh and I can see how it came across as insensitive. This isn't about her disability. This is about her selfish lack of willingness to manage her disability effectively.", "The fact that her flare-ups happen when other people plan activities and she's not in charge because she doesn't take her medicine is extremely suspect. That said you were a tad harsh. \n\nBut honestly i think you have 2 options. Travel with other people who also want to do activities. Maybe there's a smaller group who have similar interests  \n\nOr if you want to salvage the friendship you can genuinely sit down with her or everyone and explain the pattern you've noticed and ask whats really up. It's not fair to you or the money you spend for it be be vague about her flare-up and disability. \n\nAnd I agree you should write it all up and note the pattern and cost\n\nNTA", "So I don\u2019t know how to vote because you are both ta and not. \n\nYou are one because you know what you said was too harsh. Your friends are telling you what you said was too harsh, but you\u2019re not apologizing for being mean to your friend. Apologize for being mean to your friend. \n\nAs far as the rest of it, I would have flipped my ever loving mind and been *waaaay* meaner if I had a friend who didn\u2019t take their medication on the horseback riding day. If you don\u2019t wanna take it to go hiking, fine. I\u2019ll get hot and annoyed at some point and would happily go back to shade and water with you, but on horseback day, if you have a flare up and are dragging me away from the horses, your flare up because you chose not to take your meds would be the immediate conclusion of our friendship. \n\nThat sounds insane, but I don\u2019t hide my love of horses and riding for anything. It is something I don\u2019t get to do very often anymore, and there\u2019s something about it that one hour on horseback erases a year\u2019s worth of pent up stress and frees my mind and body for at least three to four months after. It is the best coping skill in my life and centers me. Unless you fell, I don\u2019t want to hear it and you better take your damn pill. \n\nThat said, I would suggest you sit down by yourself. Calculate how much money you\u2019ve spent for this trip. Calculate how many minutes you have been able to enjoy each outing before she has a \u201cflare up\u201d and take that off. Then calculate how much money you\u2019ve lost because she won\u2019t take a pill. Just for this trip. \n\nThis is not to hand her a bill. This is not to give to anyone else. This is for you. \n\nHow much did you spend?\n\nHow much went wasted?\n\nIs it worth traveling with this group in the future if this is going to forever be an issue?\n\nFor all I know, her medications may cause serious side-effects for her and it\u2019s the only thing that works, and she can\u2019t take them as frequently as you want her to in these trips. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s bad for not taking them. I\u2019m saying that there are ways to move forward without being cruel to her or resigning yourself to constantly losing money. \n\nRight now, your functioning off the anger. You spoke to her while angry, you defended yourself to your friends while angry. You\u2019ve gotten no where but labeled ta while angry. By doing the math, yeah, you\u2019re still angry, but you can make *logical* decisions going forward. \n\nIn the past, I traveled with friends who were difficult to travel with. I would get angry but then be told I was in the wrong by everyone else and swallow it down. I eventually did the math, and I realized that I was working for an entire year to afford the trip and because of this particular travel companion, I was ultimately losing ~5/8 of the money I spent. I was unwilling to work at a job every day of my life to save money for something I wanted to do, and then take 5/8 of it and set it on fire every time. I simply made that choice. \n\nThe person I was friends with who was always \u201cdown\u201d to do these things until the time came is *still* a good friend. I just don\u2019t travel with them anymore. Every so often they ask why, but I\u2019m not cruel about it. I just simply say the truth: I love them and want to be friends with them, but when we travel together I get extremely frustrated and think more about hating them then loving them. They don\u2019t like it, but they understand it. \n\nThey travel with their so who is pretty much equally \u201cI don\u2019t wanna\u201d as they are, so they have trips they enjoy of doing a lot of nothing, and I can go and travel the world and do amazing things with the people who do want to do stuff. \n\nSo find a way that you can approach this rationally. The anger makes sense and is somewhat justified, but it\u2019s not the way to go. You have a right to enjoy your trips and she has a right to not take her medications. Her rights do not outweigh your rights. Anyone who tries to convince you otherwise does not have your best interests at heart. \n\nBut apologize to your friend for being mean.", "Nta. This seems deliberate based on what I read", "NTA\n\nBut I don't think Sadie is doing this to ruin your plans. It sounds like her medicine has some unpleasant side effects so she \"forgots\" to take them and hopes everything will be ok. And suprise - it inever is. The problem is you suffer the consequnces od her decision and that makes her T A.\n\nI would talk to your friends and offer a solution - if Sadie doesn't take her medicine, she doesn't participe. She can stay and wait for you. Choice will be hers.", "Looks like you all are going to benefit from one less person in the group", "Sadie likes being the center of attention. If she tries it again, don\u2019t change plans. I have a friend that\u2019s a paraplegic. He doesn\u2019t go hiking with us.", "NTA\nYou can be disabled and an asshole at the same time and that's exactly what Sadie it.  She's weaponizing her disability to get everything her own way. Time to reconsider friendshipa here.", "The truth here is that it all depends on how you feel about your friend.\n\nWhen my wife was pregnant and we\u2019d go hiking, we do less challenging trails and move more slowly, I\u2019d rather sacrifice doing harder trails to spend time with my wife, than sacrifice spending time with my wife.\n\nI think in this instance, you don\u2019t particularly like Sadie (she just happens to be part of your friendship group) and so making a sacrifice for Sadie isn\u2019t worth it to you. Truthfully that doesn\u2019t make you an A H but perhaps there a need to be more honest with Sadie about how you feel about her.!", "You're talking like her medications fix all her problems and she's choosing to suffer to ruin your good time but tbh I highly doubt that. \n\nIm 27 and I've had chronic pain + a chronic illness all my life and while I dont know your friend and could be totally wrong I may be able to suggest alternative insights into what's going on with her. \n\nIs it possible your activities are too much for her? Is the activities she chooses more lowkey, or do they require an equal/more amount of exertion? She could be so afraid of being left out or excluded that she tries to push through it and ultimately cant, or maybe she is hoping you guys will offer to start choosing activities she can handle. \n\nWhich, let me be clear, IS a VERY wrong way to go about it because it's wasting your time and money, but at least it would mean she's not being intentionally malicious, it's her being afraid to ask and find out that she's not seen as worth creating plans for that will keep her included.\n\nMaybe the medications help her but she still struggles and is afraid to admit that because that would mean potentially being written off as having issues too unpredictable or too much trouble for you guys. Or maybe the side effects of her medications are rough on her and she simply doesn't know what to do. \n\nDisabilities are SO complex, it is rarely as simple as \"her body would be fine if she remembered her pills\". You've never asked her and honestly the way you talk is pretty dismissive, as are the comments in this thread, so I can't blame her for thinking it's a good idea to downplay her problems, even though it's not. It is terrifying to be disabled in this world because people simply don't understand. When we cant fit in with the lifestyles of able-bodied people we're treated like burdens, useless, liars, etc. \n\nBeing treated like that actually did turn me into a liar about my issues. It took me years to start admiting when I'm having a bad health day instead of pretending I can do something and then having to back out. Or I'd make up a socially acceptable \"normal\" reason (i.e other plans, a fever, car issues) to be unable to do something because it was ingrained into me at an extremely early age that my issues weren't an acceptable reason to not do something, that I should push myself past my limits or people wouldn't want to put up with me. \n\nAgain, maybe I'm totally wrong, maybe she sucks and is just weaponizing her issues so I'm not gonna call you TA, I just want you to try and find out if what's going on with her is more nuanced than what you and people in the comments think because you just don't seem to know or understand enough about her for your viewpoint to be unbiased.", "Nta.  If she\u2019s not gonna take her meds cuz they affect her other ways she needs to get them adjusted, find an alternative medication or quite putting herself into situations where her flare ups affect other peoples trip.", "INFO: You say that your group of friends are close, you've gone on several trips together throughout the years, yet you don't know what Sadie's medical condition is or how her medication affects her? How is it that you know so little about her when you've been friends with her for years?", "Nta. Sadie has learned how to weaponize her disability. Stop inviting her.", "Info: what condition does Sadie have that is managed with regular medication?", "NTA. She should have taken her pills so she wouldn't be a hindrance to everyone else's plans. But maybe apologize for telling her not to come at all, that might've been too harsh.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA for your feelings strictly based on her day she remembered to take her medication with fidelity. I would\u2019ve brought that up. \u201cHey, I know you have a chronic disability and while I don\u2019t want to detract from that, during your day you set alarms and reminders to take your medication and every other day you have not. While your disability isn\u2019t your fault, you consistently forgetting medication in a timely fashion for other people\u2019s days is inconsiderate. Please set alarms for yourself before these activities or let us know if you just do not wish to join us for particular outings.\u201d", "NTA, I would be so pissed. It\u2019s great she\u2019s invited and you all do the best you can to accommodate her (covering driving etc). But her disability is hers to manage. When she doesn\u2019t manage it and it affects an expensive group outing, after many previous learning opportunities to do better, she is the AH. You\u2019re not at the local mall refusing to stop  and let her sit on a bench. You\u2019re on a vacation you all paid for and want to enjoy ! She needs to face the harsh reality that if she can\u2019t manage her condition, she is the one who needs to proactively make sacrifices towards her own experiences instead of expecting the whole group to. I\u2019m sorry your trail ride was ruined :(", "You were harsh in what you said I would apologize for that but make a boundary that you will no longer willing to do activities with her in the future.  \n\nSounds like you already have bent over backwards and she has taken advantage of this and refuses to take any responsiblity.", "NTA - I would point out to the group that Sadie has a demonstrated pattern of being perfectly able to take her pills and fully participate when it suits her. She only \"forgets\" when it is an inconvenience to someone \"not Sadie\" - You have all been more than accomodating of her condition for years. At this point, all you are asking of Sadie is that Sadie show the rest of you the same courtesy and consideration that all of you, her friends, have consistently extended to her. If she wants to skip her pills and risk a flair up, she needs to be up front about it instead of \"forgetting\" -ensure that she can bow out on her own WITHOUT expecting the rest of the group to cut short the activities for the day. If it is an activity that someone else will HAVE TO cut their day short for her, she needs to graciously bow out entirely..... End by reiterating that you were harsh because you are hurt that You and everyone else are always going out of your way to accomodate Sadie, and yet Sadie never seems to do the same for the rest of you... isn't friendship supposed to go both ways?", "I have Hashimotos Disease. If I don\u2019t take my meds I feel like death warmed over. It is my responsibility to take my meds. If she is not taking her meds and it leads to flare ups it is on her.   \n\n\nHaving a disability does not give you the right to ruin everything for other people. NTA.", "ok so I think I have to make 2 assumptions based on what you wrote: \n\nIf she takes her pills her condition will be totally under control? this isn't a case where she took her pills and still had a hard time?\n\nalso, it sounds like she was hinting at side effects. Let's say her pills make her pee and she didn't want to pee on a horse. \n\nDid she deliberately not take her meds and then start a trail ride? you might have been harsh about how you put it but you're absolutely right. Between her condition and the side effects she was never going to complete that ride and she should have stayed out. If she had a problem with it she could have brought it up in the planning stage. It's somewhat reasonable to expect the friend group not to plan things not everyone can do. like maybe if one of your friends is in a wheelchair don't plan on rock climbing but the friend in the wheelchair needs to say something before you get to the rock. NTA", "Nta never hang our with her again.", "NTA. Im someone who has a disability for which I take medication that helps me greatly. Do I forget to take it? Sometimes, but at the same time because of how serious and painful a flare up is, if I forget it's usually only a couple hours later and I take it immediately. I also knowing that I can have flare ups wherever, always come prepared, obviously this may not be the case for your friends disability but as people with disabilities we have learned ways to prep and cope. \n\nIt also sounds like this friend was specifically doing on on things she didn't want to do as she took it fine on her planned day, which honestly just isn't fair (and honestly is a really dangerous thing to do for someone with a disability like this and concerning tbh). My ex partner was so excited to go camping, I had never been dreaded the idea and was in a wheel chair with a flare up and I still went with a smile. It's not fair that you miss out too and you're waisting money.\n\n If the friend didn't want to go they could have just said so, rather than put their health in danger and take away everyone else's enjoyment. Agreeing to go on the trip then sabotaging themselves and dampening everyone else's fun is manipulative and genuinely concerning they might put themselves through this. I have a hard time saying no especially because I dont want to let people down but it sounds like your friend may have to learn to say no. Saying hey im not up for it or im having a flare and staying at the hotel is different then going purposely not taking medication and then making everyone else turn back. When I have a flair im the first to apologize profusely for having to cancel plans or go home early but if im leaving its strictly me, the camping trip I earlier posted about I called it and was like hey I tried it im too sick for this im going home, you all have fun.", "NTA. To repeat a favorite quote (as a person with several disabilities myself): Your disability is not your fault, but it is your responsibility. \n\nSadie can\u2019t help having a disability, but it is up to her to both know her limits and follow her treatment plan. She doesn\u2019t like the side effects of her medication, but it magically doesn\u2019t bother her on her day of activities. She forgets to take it, but can set an alarm only on her day of activities. \n\nWhen I travel with friends, I try to think ahead to what activities will most likely make things worse for me and adjust accordingly by drinking more water beforehand or planning to sit out an activity the next day rather than burden the rest of the group. \n\nSometimes flares happen and I do feel bad about it, but my friends are usually understanding because I\u2019ve done everything I can possibly do to manage them or avoid them entirely. Your friend put it no effort, except for her day. That\u2019s unacceptable.", "NTA. \n\nReading between the lines of what you've written, it sounds like she has a chronic pain/exhaustion illness like fibromyalgia, ME, possibly POTS...so her meds would be heavy duty painkillers that come with some side effects. I'm on similar medications. \n\nWhen you're disabled and you have to take meds daily, it is vital that you don't stop and start them without warning because it could do serious damage. That goes beyond selfishness and carelessness into endangering herself for stupid reasons. It's understandable to miss a dose here and there due to brain fog or sheer absent-mindedness but to be missing doses on a regular basis is dangerous, especially when she has a system to help her remember. \n\nWhen I travel with big groups of people, I usually do my own thing because I know there are some activities I just can't do, that's the hand I was dealt. I'd never go on a trail or a tour like the one you described, just hearing about it I know I couldn't handle it and Sadie should have been well aware of her limits. \n\nUnfortunately there are some disabled people who grow addicted to the attention and validation they get from their illness, which sometimes leads to them pulling stunts for more attention and validation. It's not ableist to expect the disabled person to know their limits and manage their symptoms accordingly.

This time, it was on a group trip we\u2019ve been planning for over a year. Due to how high the cost of the trip was, we each decided to take a day and plan an activity that the whole group would participate in. We also rented a van together to get to our destination as that was the most ideal situation. \n\nThe first issue with Sadie came up when getting to our destination. Due to the length of the drive, everyone was going to be driving an hour to get to our destination. Right before it was Sadie\u2019s turn, she had a flare up, and could not drive. Our friend took over. \n\nThe next morning, my friend had planned a tour of the town. We all reminded Sadie several times to take her medication as this was an expensive tour and we did not want it to be cut short. Well, she had forgotten and the tour had to be cut short. This is when I got genuinely upset because this was now my money being wasted.\n\nThroughout the week, she had flare ups pretty often.The actual fight that led to this post occurred on my day though. The previous day, Sadie had had no flare ups. (It was also her day to plan). This was because she had set alarms to take her medication regularly so that she would be ok. We all reminded her to please take her pills like that again.\n\nI decided to take all my friends on a trail ride on horses as the trails in this town are known for being absolutely beautiful. We paid extra for a basics lesson prior to the trail. In the basics lesson, we were all paired off based on experience and performance in the small arena that they had. I was paired with Sadie.\n\nWell, 1/4th of the way through the trail, she started having a flare up. I told her that I would not be turning around as this was expensive and that I was truly looking forward to this. She begged me to turn around. Finally, the ranger told us that I had to turn around with her as she was my partner.\n\nIn the car, I told her that she knew how important this was to me and that she just should\u2019ve taken the pills. She told me that I was being ableist and that I didn\u2019t know what the pills did to her. We got into a huge argument in which I said \u201cif your disability can\u2019t take being a good friend, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t come on these trips anyway.\u201d\n\nWhile I agree that it was harsh, I didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong considering that she had cost us so much money over the years for simply not wanting to do something. My other friends agree that Sadie is inconvenient at times but that I should\u2019ve been more sensitive to her condition. I\u2019m honestly torn on whether to apologize or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if the pills have side effects she doesn't like she shouldn't ruin the trip for others. That's just self centered and she's not a good friend.

Personally I just wouldn\u2019t invite her anymore.", "NTA. Sounds like Sadie likes having the control and attention.

And tbh if she wasted my money like that on something I really wanted to see I would be very harsh with her.

Going forward refuse to pair with her and refuse to cut anything short because of her refusal to properly medicate herself. Medication can be hard on the body but that shouldn't affect other people's enjoyment at all. \n\nNTA!", "NTA. She chooses when to take her medication and she lies about it so she can have an excuse to redirect everyone. There is zero reason she wouldn't have reminders set. You're not being ableist to not want to have your time and money wasted by her choice not to stay engaged. You aren't imagining that she'll take her pills when she wants to.", "As a disabled person, wtf Sally. OP, you're NTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s not \u201cinconvenient,\u201d she weaponizing her own condition to force people to change their plans. I\u2019d never travel with her again and if I had to, I\u2019d make clear that whatever happens as a result of her refusing to take her pills is on her.", "On the one hand, the fact that Sadie doesn't always take her meds and it disproportionately affects plans people other than her wanted to make is a problem. It's kind of a dick move to be willing to take your meds when it's something you want to do, but then not to take them for other people's activities. My one hesitation is I don't really feel like we're getting a full sense of the problem (like does she literally never take her meds for anyone else's stuff, or is it just that during the limited times where she doesn't take her meds, it happens to be someone else's turn? The former is an AH move, the latter less so).\n\nOn the other hand, it sounds like she doesn't always take her meds, not because she forgets (as you claim) but also because the side effects can be bad. If she feels she has to be off the meds sometimes to avoid/get a break from certain side effects, the courteous thing for her friends to do is to plan trips where most if not all of the activities would be doable even if she has a flare-up, rather than planning every activity under the assumption that she can just take her meds. Maybe it means only having a couple of activities like paired horseback riding and then planning other activities done solo or done somewhere where she can dip out if necessary, but everyone else can continue on. The fact that there seems to be no accommodation for her because meds exist that she can take doesn't seem like particularly friendly behavior, either. If she's really a friend, you should want to make sure not only that she can physically attend but that she's comfortable doing so and that thought is put into making sure alternatives or options are in place if she can't take her meds one day; it's not clear that the latter is happening", "Can the medication be causing memory issues?

It's her 'forgetfulness'.", "Nta.

If she can take the pills on the day of her activities she can take them everyday. It\u2019s not just you that she is inconveniencing and costing money. And it sounds like it\u2019s not the disability itself you have a problem with but her unwillingness to follow through on the treatment for it. I take medication daily and if I don\u2019t take it that\u2019s my problem and nobody else\u2019s. I don\u2019t expect everyone to change plans for me because I forgot.

Or at least stop inviting her to anything beyond a meal out or something. If she wants to use her disability as a weapon to get her way, she can find new people to do things with.

The only time you can be bothered to remember to do so is when it's something you want to do.

We understand that sometimes medical conditions are unpredictable.

It's something that happens with relative frequency, so she should either abstain from joining in certain activities or remember to take her pills, in order to not affect others.\n\nYou, on the other hand, should be more respectful of her and her condition. You don't know what her condition is, and you don't know what the pills do to her. So this means, to me (correct me if I'm wrong), that you don't care. \nIf you did, instead of lashing at her, you would have asked her more about the condition and its effects and tried to understand how limiting it is to her. This way, you would be more considerate of her, and pick activities which wouldn't put an excessive strain on her.\n\nAdditionally, your \"pretty close group of friends\" should discuss beforehand how interested they are in each activity so you could delegate the job of looking after Sadie in case she has a flare up to the person least interested, so that the others could enjoy the experience fully.\n\nI don't know what you think, but to me, that's what a \"pretty close group of friends\" would do.", "YTA.

You must accommodate me.\u201d\n\nThis is the mindset of the accommodation generation. IMO it\u2019s partly an unforeseen outcome of a strongly positive change: we no longer discard children with disabilities. It used to be sink or swim in the schools. The top students and top athletes were celebrated and the kids at the bottom - oh well, we tried. Sort of. We gave them the same education but they sadly couldn\u2019t handle it. Today we have 504s and IEPs and supports that allow children with disabilities to access education in theory, even if not a perfect solution. And now a third of all children are on IEPs or 504s. \n\nHowever there is no IEP for life. We take responsibility for children who cannot self accommodate, but adults need to accommodate themselves. Unfortunately not all children are weaned off the supports. (IMO this needs to happen during high school.) They assume they are entitled to accommodations at many levels that don\u2019t exist. They cannot comprehend that everyone has something, so they expect the focus to remain on their own problems. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with this from two angles - one of my kids has a serious health condition (genetic, incurable) and the other has a learning disability. Both went through school on 504 plans. But with my eldest it soon became clear that I could either raise him as a disabled person, or I could raise him as a perfectly normal person who has a disability. And now he\u2019s a perfectly normal college student (unlike many with his condition). I still help him manage the tricky bits of his health care but he could do it alone if he had to, and he has a high quality of life. \n\nNeither of my kids gets much sympathy from me, because I don\u2019t want them feeling sorry for themselves. So when a flare up prevents my eldest from doing something, he can\u2019t do it. When the younger forgot to arrange for his test accommodations he took the hit, talked to the professor, and brought his grade back up. Their lives are theirs to live so they might as well live them.

It sounds more like control and communication issues.\n\nFrom what you've said, it sounds like she takes her medications faithfully to prepare for activities she wants to do, and rarely/never needs to turn back early for those activities as a result.  It also sounds like she is purposely not taking her medications in order to weaponize her symptoms to get out of the other activities, rather than being an adult and communicating in a healthy way when she doesn't want to, or even can't, participate.\n\nIt is possible that the medications have side effects that prevent her from taking them all the time, thus forcing her to choose which activities to prevent the flareups for.  It would make sense that if her functional time is limited, she would save that functional time for her favorite activities, and it would not surprise me if that is what she was trying to express when she referenced OP \"not knowing what the pills do to her\". But that still does not excuse her RSVPing for things she knows she can't do and ruining those events for everyone else.\n\nIt is more than possible for everyone in this group to have fun on a trip without the friend overextending herself.  I have a friend with disabilities who needs to rest often, and for longer activities he plans a place to rest (spare room, hotel room, etc.) and excuses himself when needed.  He also does not come along on days when he knows he is not feeling up to that day's activities.  Unless there is something I am not understanding in OP's situation, it sounds like when the friend needs to stop an activity, she is expecting everyone to stop with her, rather than excusing herself and perhaps rejoining the group later.  It also sounds like the friend is agreeing to things she knows she can't fulfill due to not having taken her medications.

I\u2019m disabled and share everything with everyone what I need and what to do if something happens. I also plan for everything that could go wrong and make a plan to keep it from happening with those I\u2019m with. Sadly those with disabilities tend to be higher maintenance than a healthy person and learn what limitations they have. I have a feeling that there\u2019s something else about taking the meds at play here? Like some make comments about her taking meds in public or  in front of her friends? I used to have people in my life who would make it known that they thought I was a drug addict due to me taking meds around the clock or being vocal about me taking medications in front of them. Also had people tell me that I\u2019m disabled due to all the medications I\u2019m on.", "Sadie should have simply refrain from the trip. Yes it feels shitty you know what feels worse having people resent you for not being an adult and taking care of yourself. Understand your limitations and stop bringing ppl down", "Just because people have disabilities doesnt mean they cannot qualify of being a shitty friend. Sadie has been a shitty friend to EVERY person on this trip when she planned and commited to activities she didnt communicate she would not be able to do outside of not liking them. Not liking something and not being able to participate or two different things. She sounds like a nightmare of a person to be around and quite frankly the only thing probably stopping everyone from saying anything is her disability. So either she wants to be treated like anyone else with a rationale level of care and respect or coddled and treated different. Either way she is a shit person who created resentment in others by wasting time, energy, efforts and committing WHAT SHE NEEDS TO ENJOY A VACATION OUTSIDE OF MAKING IT ABOUT HER WANTS", "So it\u2019s ok to expect your friends to lose money and experiences regularly to accommodate you?", "It\u2019s also possible that Sadie is being deliberately vague about her illness.", "No, this girl is intentionally not taking her medicine when it comes to events she doesn't want to participate in. This is a manipulation tactic.  I think maybe she shouldn't be invited on the next trip. I would be pretty pissed off if every plan we had got cut short except for the one she planned.", "Why does the condition matter? It\u2019s Sadie\u2019s job to not be a detriment to the plans of the group as a whole. It her responsibility to tell her friends what\u2019s going on and prepare for it.", "In your words you never bothered to ask", "Yep. I have a cousin just like Sadie. Legitimate health issues to be sure, but constantly dials them up to 11 around certain people for sympathy and attention. \n\nOP, honestly, I\u2019d be pissed too if I were in your shoes. And I really wouldn\u2019t travel with this person again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ableist to be annoyed by someone wasting your time and money. NTA.", "Sounds manipulative AF. I\u2019ve lost many friends over the years because I wasn\u2019t feeling ok and wouldn\u2019t go out with them. It\u2019d be just me complaining about the pain and I wouldn\u2019t want them to stop what they were doing for me. I have absolutely 0 friends today over this. I do regret losing contact (part my fault cause I also didn\u2019t reach out) but I never ruined anyone\u2019s fun", "I think, based on Sadie's comment about what the pills do to her, that she likely experiences some bad side effects from the medication that make it so she'd rather flare up than take it. Should she be travelling and making the trip hard for other people given that this is the case? No, but it's hard to say that she's doing it solely for attention based off one post. It could be a combination of multiple factors that include control and attention, but to say that it's only about control and attention feels a bit reductive when it seems like there's more going on here.", "Precisely this!", "Ngl I got my health issues too but it kinda just sounds like she's taking the piss and seeing how long you guys will deal with it", "You are not being ableist. It sounds like she is capable of participating if only she took her medication. This is a very manageable, reasonable thing. For you to be ableist you would have planned an activity that she wouldn\u2019t be able to do no matter what, or insisted on an activity she objected to PRIOR to the trip. \n\nShe is not a good friend. A good friend would not be this careless, disrespectful, and thoughtless of your time, effort, and money. Again: she is not a good friend, and unless she can produce a reasonable explanation for her actions and behavior and at the VERY LEAST compensated you for forfeiting the activity, IMO she is also not a good person. She is weaponizing her condition to behave in a grossly entitled way. Those are not the actions of a good person.", "But did she had any flares before that, when all she had to do was rest in the back? \ud83e\udd14", "She\u2019s doing this all on purpose.", "Good chance that the later in the day the more likely for flare-ups.  But if that's the case she should know that and ask to be one of the first drivers.  Either way, she should have asked if she could be one of the first ones so that way if she does have a flare up there's still opportunity to take a shift later in the day (assuming her flareups are hours long and not days long).", "You should ask her to cover part of the cost of the horseback riding that got cut short. That\u2019s the least she can do", "To be fair, sometimes a clear understanding is difficult. But that\u2019s why communication is critical - I have straight up told my friends \u201cI don\u2019t know if I am up for that but I want to try\u201d so we can make a plan for if it doesn\u2019t work out. (Like where I can go sit and wait for them to meet up again, or similar.)", "This is it. I have a chronic ilness too and even with meds flares can be unpredictable. It mostly affects my ability to walk or I have a lot of pain in my legs. But I would never want to have anyone else cut short their good time for me. City tour? Thats okay, I'll find a little caf\u00e9 or another quiet place to sit and I will see you after. Horseback riding wouldn't be a possibility anyways, so please go but also please videocall me if you're stopping at a place with a nice view! I can't ask people to basically stop living just because I can't do something", "I would argue that if that\u2019s the case, she still shouldn\u2019t come along for the expensive activities on the days she doesn\u2019t want to take her medication. I understand that sometimes shit happens\u2014I have disabilities myself that sometimes cuts into the fun I can have with friends\u2014but if shit is happening every day except your own, then you shouldn\u2019t be going to the other activities.", "What a horrible thing to do to a group of friends though. Ruining every other day because she could only take her meds one day with your hypothetical situation for her. She can\u2019t ruin a weeks vacation for everyone for a single day of fun for her. At least she should get her own room and just tell everyone to have fun and she\u2019ll see them in the evening and on that single day.

She should sideline herself and not be a detriment to others.

She should stay at home.", "i have several chronic disabilities and get how that can work. it's still incredibly selfish to go to activities she knows she can't do without medication without at least have a plan in place so she doesn't make everyone else cut their activities short. that's true regardless of the disability. \n\nalso, i much prefer my friends to not pry into the specifics of my disabilities and treatment plans. if the friend wanted OP to know, she'd tell her. now, when friends just don't bother thinking about the accommodations they *know* i need, that's very different and i do wonder if anyone took that into consideration when choosing their activities. if not, i'd probably act like sadie too. also that shit about driving is just petty so yeah. i feel OP is likely an unreliable narrator here.", "Your explanation would make what she\u2019s doing 100% worse and manipulative imo, that\u2019s saying she\u2019s lying to her friends about forgetting to take her meds and choosing specifically to only take them on her day, which means that she doesn\u2019t care about whether her friends have fun on their day or waste their time or money. It\u2019d be one thing if she told her friends she wasn\u2019t taking her meds that day, but if this is the reason and she\u2019s intentionally not taking them and saying she forgot, then it\u2019s likely she knows that if she told them they would tell her to stay home but she cares more about not being left out than them having fun.", "Would taking it everyday for a week cause liver damage?

You should probably know of any warnings on her medication. My mom's psoraisis meds specifically say Avoid prolonged exposure to sun while taking the medicine.\n\nAnother thing of note, medicine for disabilities isn't a cure, it's a management. You talked about her not taking her turn to drive as her willfully doing such. But LONG car rides where you are stuck in an uncomfortable position for multiple hours is MURDER on disabilities. If you want Sadie to help drive and she agrees to help drive or asks to help drive.

No one believed me, then she texted my husband saying she thought she broke her foot and she needed him to drive her to a hospital (her foot was fine, but I'm guessing she couldn't find an excuse to go to the hospital for one of her chronic issues) and then tried to pretend that everything was normal the next day. People acted like I was psychic.

That's what I'm guessing.\n\nThis friend group sounds barely fair to Sadie, and this OP not fair or kind at all.", "she knows they won't call her on her shit cause she'll do what she did to op and call them ableist. she's a terrible friend, and they should grow a spine and drop her. she's absolutely doing this shit on purpose", "My thing is if medicine is iffy for Sadie then she needs to mitigate things before hand like know triggers and things like that if she doesn\u2019t take her meds and be prepared to sit it out for any activity she can\u2019t do as a result but not deter others from going ahead and doing it.", "This is what I was going to say. She should at least communicate that and either not come on the trips or only go to the outings that are less strenuous and stay at the hotel/whatever on the other days so that shit like this doesn\u2019t happen", "Exactly this. I have a chronic autoimmune disorder (psoriatic arthritis). I assume the medication Sadie is referring to is steroids, probably prednisone, which sure does have some horrible side effects. She is well within her right to not take it if she doesn\u2019t want to, but she has to anticipate having a flare in that case and should be staying home. Instead, she\u2019s using the activities as a way to garner sympathy and attention, and ruining the whole groups\u2019 vacation. She seems immature and self involved, with very little empathy for anyone else. So wrapped up in her own world and her own illness that she doesn\u2019t care how her actions affect others. If I were OP, I\u2019d let the group know that my participation in these activities will no longer be tied to Sadie\u2019s participation. If she can\u2019t hack it, she can go home, and OP (and the rest of the friends, if they want) can finish the activity she paid for. If there are partner activities that require both people\u2019s participation, refuse to be partnered with Sadie. It\u2019s time to put your foot down, essentially, and let Sadie and the rest of your friends that it is simply unfair and untenable to expect everyone to not do something or stop doing something because Sadie cannot do it. She is welcome to the activities, and if she comes, accommodations can be made (like stopping more frequently to rest while hiking, or needing a wheelchair or scooter if they\u2019re out shopping, things like that). But Sadie no longer gets to have blanket I\u2019m-leaving-and-everyone-has-to-come-with-me permission. \n\nAs a side note, the only person I have ever asked to not do something that I can\u2019t do is my husband. Because he is my partner and I want to do stuff that we can both do, so we can connect and have that memory together. But even then, if it\u2019s something he really really wants to do, I will suck it up and medicate myself to be able to go with him. And if that\u2019s not possible, I will give him a hug and a kiss and tell him to have fun and tell me about it when he gets back. Because I care about him and I want him to experience things that make him happy.", "Oh yeah, I can usually tell if I'm going to have a flair or not, so if I know I usually sit out of activities. But it's really heart breaking to be out on a vacation with friends and have to stay back alone multiple days while everyone else gets to do the fun things. \n\nAlso I need to make it clear, I 100% understand OPs frustration. I also understand Sadie needs to recognize what her disability puts others through. The only thing I disagreed with is calling her manipulative, when all we really know is she has a disability that has flare ups. I don't think there's enough information here to call someone manipulative (which I feel like reddit is so quick to do).", "This.

Almost all meds have side effects. Obviously, I know nothing about Sadie's illness and am not a doctor, but this reeks of manipulation and attention seeking. Sadie is going to have to get a better hold on her med regimen before she loses friends.", "Yes, agreed. Sadie needs to do better at planning for trips where a lot of the planned activities won't have good accommodations for her disability. I'm just trying to point out that calling Sadie manipulative may be a bit much considering how little we know. It's a bit of Hanlon's Razor.", "Oh yeah 100% agree. Sadie clearly needed to figure out some way to accommodate her own issues on this trip, she's definitely not without fault. I just wouldn't call her manipulative. \n\nI also agree that it seems like folks in the group may not have taken her into account. Clearly the premise of activities was that every person gets 1 day to do something they want and EVERYONE does it together. Which is wild to me personally, because that just increases the chance that someone is miserable on the outing, or someone winds up spending the day along because they can't come for one reason or another. \n\nThis is just overall a shitty situation for everyone involved, and I think everyone involved needed to do a little bit more planning to make a trip like this work.", "Exactly, Sadie is responsible for her own disability and speaking up for herself.

Most of my meds cause sleepiness, would you want someone driving while on certain medications? Even BP meds can cause drowsiness. Also they could be lying to their doctors, DMV and insurance about their condition. Take me for example while I don\u2019t drive I technically still have my drivers license\ud83e\udd2b because I lie to the DMV, my doctor knows this but also knows I won\u2019t drive so he won\u2019t contact them to take it away (if he were to find out he\u2019d do it in a heartbeat and asks my family to make sure). My reasoning is that I feel like it would be admitting defeat if I give it completely up and I refuse to be defeated my medical conditions. I also know of way too many people who have the same condition and pass out yet refuse to quit driving because of stupid reasons.

Also if my side effects are that bad I let my doctor know and we may try a different med to see if it works and doesn\u2019t have side effects.

Sadie seems like she's doing a poor job of striking a balance between these things, but I don't think we know enough about the situation to say that she's only doing it for attention and control.", "Absolutely agree", "I'm on board with everything you said about Sadie perhaps having good days and bad days - I know that can definitely happen. And that Sadie may have planned something that was more in line with her abilities, whereas others may have planned things that were harder for her. Absolutely. BUT.. surely everyone discussed what they were going to do ahead of time, yes?

If I thought horseback riding might be okay but then woke up the morning of and realized I was not having a good day...I wouldn't go horseback riding. If I was already horseback riding and realized that it was too much for me, I wouldn't beg my friends to stop with me, I would beg the guide to let them go on without me so they didn't miss out on something that they were looking forward to and had paid for. Like, there are a million opportunities for Sadie to both be unable to do the planned activity and NOT be the ahole, but she missed all of them.\n\nAlso, I would be more lenient if this was a one time thing that Sadie didn't know how to handle.

When I was on a medication that required 8 pills a day, I set 8 individual alarms.

I\u2019m so on top of it which is my responsibility", "That's the thing about being on medication all the time: most medications aren't just \"oh, you have [problem]? Take this. Problem solved!\" In reality you you usually have to weigh up each medication to find the right balance between \"does the job it's supposed to be doing\" and \"doesn't have side effects I can't live with.\" \n\nSeems like Sadie hasn't found that balance. I don't know how long Sadie's been on her meds or what her specific disability is, but in general you don't just decide to skip them and only take them on certain days. I'm sure her doctor wouldn't recommend it, and she's a big girl now, she needs to either sort out her med regime or accept that a trip away with a group doing all kinds of activities is just not something she can manage. I don't know if there are other meds she can try, but it doesn't sound like she's taken a proactive approach to figuring it out. \n\nAnd she's right, if you have a routine (and let's face it, when you're disabled you do have a routine and it's built around your disability and the ways you manage it) then being away from home can make it easier to forget to take your meds....but there are *so many* workarounds for that. Like your smart pill box. I don't have one but I do have a shortcut on my iPad that tells me when it's time to take my meds. And if I'm leaving the house I always, always set alarms on my phone. If Sadie can do this for \"her\" day, but not for any other day, I don't blame OP at all for losing her patience. \n\nHonestly any time I've been in a situation like this, if an activity or outing comes up and I'm not able for it, I'll say \"you guys go and have fun, I need to rest so I'm going to loaf around the hotel today. I'll try to meet up with you for dinner and you can tell me all about it!\" I would be absolutely mortified if I thought someone was missing out on things they'd planned or paid for just because my body was being a dick that day. \n\nOP I think that you and your friends made a lot of effort to include Sadie, and it doesn't sound like she made half as much of an effort to meet you halfway. Maybe you were a bit harsh when you told her she shouldn't have come, but she had ruined the day you were most looking forward to. It's understandable that you were disappointed and irritated.

But there are some harsh things OP said that they shouldn't because without the nessecary information they have no right to do so. And the point about that isn't that Sadie isn't required to tell, it's that OP specifically said they don't care and that they can't say they don't care to find out if something is the case and then judge someone for that thing they don't even know. So yeah, Sadie's behaviour is not okay, but OP's behaviour is not ideal either.

Think hiking; Sadie may have been begging for the guide to let Sadie return due to the pain, but the rules of the place were that the entire group returns or the entire group continues and no other option.\n\n2. As someone with a physical limitation, others often don't provide necessary details to allow us to plan. I choose to travel solo due to the nasty surprises others think are totally fine or even great to spring on others, but often threaten my ability to participate or preclude it completely. They aren't used to thinking this way. So, your assumptions are faulty.  \nEven when others *do* disclose plans, they forget the details that make or break participation for us--such as long, isolated trail ride requirements, lack of rest stops one experiencing a flare-up could wait in, or rules such as lone riders cannot return to the ranch alone, etc. \n\n3. The day can start out great. You can think it's going to be a great day physically, and an hour or two in, the load or type of activity triggers the worst flare of your life. There is no predicting.

Every single day. Every single day of the trip she has done this. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty hard to plan and accommodate around someone who hasn\u2019t shared her limitations.

I've been actively working on myself for just about 7 years now, and while it's been really hard at points to admit that I was awful, it's given me far more clarity and higher self esteem than you can ever imagine. \n\n7 years ago, I was petty, vindictive, racist, homophobic, fatphobic, and just about every other awful thing you can be, all while convincing myself that I was an amazing person simply because of the culty religion I was part of. Then I got kicked out of that cult (it's still my greatest accomplishment), and I realized something: if a religion tells teenage girls to marry men who are far older than them that they barely know, maybe everything else they say is wrong too. \n\nSo I took stock of my life. I thought very carefully about every time I thought of myself as a good person and then secretly looked down on someone for being different from me. I thought of all the things I secretly admired about other people that I had to publicly shame because of my religion--things like tattoos, being LGBTQ, having brightly coloured hair, being extroverted. And I decided that I never again wanted to feel ashamed of myself because of my thoughts or my actions. I never again wanted someone to hate themselves because of the way I treated them. \n\nSo I changed. I genuinely believe that the person I was died in those months that I was taking stock and thinking through how I would put my ideas of being a new person into action. I did very nearly end my own life at a few points because of how difficult the process was. At the end, though, I emerged as a brand new person. I even changed my name because my old name belonged to someone I didn't want to be anymore. I moved to a new city. I lost friends. I lost almost my entire family because they refused to support who I was trying to become. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do, and I have not had an easy life. But it was completely worth it. \n\nI know I'm still a work in progress, but honestly, doing all of that has shown me that it is possible to change who you are, and it is 100% worth it. I've also learned that some hurts can't be forgiven, no matter how much a person changes after the fact. I've also learned that it's okay to ask for forgiveness and be rejected, and all you can do sometimes is try to repair the ills you've caused and then leave it alone. It's also okay to let go of the anger and hurt and pain that someone else has caused you while not allowing them back into your life to potentially cause more damage. \n\nAll of this to say, it's never too late to make a change, no matter how big or impossible it feels.", "Me too\u2026\ud83c\udf3a", "Well said. And nice friends can do many things at once (well, really at different times). They can make sure to plan activities that the disabled person can do, they can ask the disabled person to events that are challenging and then be prepared to back out if it becomes a problem, and they can acknowledge that it sucks and participate in activities without the disabled friend.\n\nIn some ways, it's no different than any difference among friends. I hate shopping. My friends only occasionally invite me to shopping events with no expectation that I go. Sometimes I go and I enjoy the time with my friends. I find a comfortable place to sit when I've quickly looked at all the stuff and enjoy the people watching. I can hear about shopping trips without feeling left out.\n\nIt's all good. There are other activities we enjoy and there are things I like that my friends don't particularly care for. It's give and take without keeping score.", "Yeah, what she's doing is shitty and unfair to her friends on the trip for sure. I'm just offering some possibilities as to why she may be acting as she is", "Yup, and that makes her an asshole in this situation.", "Oh yeah, there's a few different kinds. There's electronic ones (they don't connect to your other devices, basically when you open the pillbox and close it again, it starts a timer counting down until your next dose) and then there's ones that connect with your phone and your family members can also check to see if you've taken your meds! They're kind of expensive but I can see them being worth the outlay for quite a lot of people.", "That's basically what I do except I don't have Apple Health! I don't take the pills at the same time every day, and despite having the pill boxes with the morning/afternoon/evening/night compartments, I frequently find myself thinking \"fuck me the pain is really bad, did I take my pills?\" I might have taken them literally ten minutes ago but not be able to remember whether I did or not. \n\nI set up a shortcut so that when I take my pills, I say \"hey Siri, pills\" and it creates a new reminder for me in six hours' time. So if I'm wondering \"fuck it hurts when can I have my pills\" all I have to do is look at my reminders to see. \n\nI also used to have a shortcut that let me ask \"hey Siri, when can I have my pills?\" and it would check the reminders for me and tell me the time of my next dose, but for some reason the last iOS update borked it and I can't figure out why. \n\nWhen you're taking meds four times a day every day, manually setting reminders every time gets extremely frustrating and every time you do it you think \"there's got to be a more efficient way to do this\" or maybe that's just me \ud83d\ude02\n\n now, is it foolproof? No. I literally have two things to do: (1) take pills, (2) tell Siri I've taken them - and if I'm distracted I might do (1) and forget (2). So I make a point of stopping whatever I'm doing and saying \"hey Siri, pills\" *while I have the pills in my hand.* So far, so good. And it cost me \u20ac0. \n\nI'm sure apple health probably makes it even easier if you have an iPhone", "Exactly, this sounds like a recurring issue.", "I was thinking the same thing. I deal with chronic pain and migraines. I\u2019ve had to sit a few trips out or just chill and relax in a hotel room while my friends were out doing things I couldn\u2019t that day.

Other preps should have been made to accommodate. \n\nSo we go on a holiday most years as a group.  About 9 couples.  One year I'd had back surgery and one of the men had had a hip replacement surgery.  We knew we wouldn't be able to do the majority of the physically activities.  So we had 2 choices.  Not go and just be miserable, or go with our spouses but hang out doing activities together and sending the partners off with the group so that we still got the fun times like the big meals and such. It was win win. They did the big physical stuff, jet skiing, mountain hikes other really physically stuff. We hired scooters from the hotel and went on a vineyard tour. Bought day tickets and veged out in a local cinema all day. Made it our mission to visit every patisserie in the local town and eat a cake at each...\nAnd it worked well because if someone had a bit much on the 'physical day's they could join us the next day for an 'easy day.

And if this was the first trip, hopefully it shows Sadie what she can actually handle and know that she can't participate next time.", "Self advocacy is your responsibility though. Not everyone is going to revolve their planning around you, if you need to change an activity that\u2019s your job to speak up on, not other people\u2019s job.", "I\u2019m not saying anyone needs to ask for a persons entire medical history but to ask for basic information and so I can make an informed decision. If that makes a person uncomfortable so be it. My safety and the safety of others is more important than a little discomfort. Would you feel comfortable with someone who has a seizure disorder driving? Or be ok knowing that they drive at all? Would you be ok if someone was taking medication that can cause delayed reaction time or high amounts of opioids for chronic pain? It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.", "When confronted with that, she immediately shifted gears into calling OP and ableist and saying OP doesn\u2019t know what the medication does to her.\n\nSo which is it? Is she forgetful (except when it would affect something she wants to do), or does she choose not to take it because of the side effects (in which case she is admitting to doing it on purpose), or is she actually taking the pills because she\u2019s proven that it\u2019s fine for her to take her medication when not taking it would stop her from doing what she wants to do, and she\u2019s just lying and saying she\u2019s having a flare up so she can get out of doing things she doesn\u2019t want to do while minimising the chance of her looking like an asshole and a bad friend, while actively causing others to waste their time and money and ruin their trip?\n\nI\u2019d say option three is most likely, but in all honesty it doesn\u2019t really matter. Whatever the reason, she is ruining others\u2019 fun but is fine whenever it\u2019s what *she* wants to do.

I work shift work, so sometimes my med schedule has to be shifted which definitely throws me off. The difference is that if i don't have the time to do a gentle medication time change, i probably won't come to a big event.

Yes the side effects suck, but that\u2019s why it isn\u2019t generally a long term medication.

It could be incredibly dangerous for doctors to not have that information in the case of an emergency.\n\nThese supposed flares are too conveniently timed to ruin other people\u2019s plans. Not to mention side effects or no side effects messing with prescription medication like that is not safe.

It took a while for everyone to realize I meant it when I say I don\u2019t mind, I know I cannot keep up and will be in pain, and they should nt have to not do things because of that.

As far as everyone else was aware, she was just mysteriously forgetting to take them before things she didn't want to do. She sat there as others repeatedly reminded her to take her meds. Set alarms. Presumably allowed them to continue believing that things would be fine as long as she remembered the meds. While knowing that she actually had no intention of taking them.\n\nIf the problem was side effects, she should have properly communicated that to everyone else and clearly defined her limits. Not necessarily specifics. But just \"hey guys. I'm having a bad day today. Probably going to have a flair in a few hours. Yall go ahead without me\"", "This. Side effects were worth it to her when it was an important thing for her. Not worth it when it was for others. Which is fine, then just don\u2019t go do those other activities.", "It could be she chose her activity with the side effects in mind.  Let\u2019s say everyone picks a bunch of outdoor activities but she picks a day at wineries, she might be comfortable taking a medicine that causes diarrhea bc she picked an activity with a constant presence of bathrooms.  If she doesn\u2019t always have a flare up, she might think \u201cthe chances of a flare up are better than definite diarrhea on a horseback ride\u201d. \n\nBut really she should take her medicine as prescribed and bow out of activities she can\u2019t do while on her medication.", "Exactly.

If I think that it could be triggered, by only having 4 hours sleep, I'll err on the side of caution and not take that dose.", "Almost all meds also need to build up in your system for the effects to work.

I don't think anyone there even knows what her disability is, and Sadie should have told them.", "Yes. And now she\u2019s trying to explain that by saying she only tells close friends.

She doesn\u2019t need to give all the gory details (and I don\u2019t agree with the commenters picking on OP for not knowing the issues in detail), but she needs to be sufficiently forthcoming, through others if needed, about what the risks are to people who are trying to cooperate with her.

I have chronic autoimmune disorders and will absolutely forget to take meds in either the morning or evening due to frequent brain fog. Therefore, I have daily alarms that go off whether I'm home or not. I don't always take the evening ones on time if I'm out and about, but I take them when I get home or pay the price the next day. There is no reason to set the alarms for one day only.\n\nThere IS a cost for me doing practically anything social, ranging from a mild migraine to three days completely bedridden. I have lived with these diseases long enough to do that calculus in my head. Are the friends/activities worth the extra effort and subsequent suffering? How late can I stay out and still get the ten hours of sleep I need to fully 'recover'?\n\nSadie is treating her friends badly by being irresponsible. I fully sympathize with the heartache of having to sit things out, but I also proactively take steps to still enjoy life by selecting the activities I most want to participate in and taking steps before and after to minimize the damage to my overall health.", "I just posted that exact same response, I have something that could become a disability so my phone/watch tells me when to take my meds and I follow it religously so it does not effect me or others.  its my responsibility to keep up with it.", "Because they stated it in the post.

I don\u2019t resent them going, the kids should be able to have fun.  And there were several things they did I could go to.  \n\nIf all the things are something the disabled person can\u2019t do it\u2019s a problem.

No. I am actually forcing myself to try and be whole.", "This was my thought! Something about Sadie just doesn't add up. We're close enough to go on vacation together but not close enough to know what's wrong with you (if anything actually is) or meds. \n\nI'm very wary of people who have illnesses that they won't or can't explain. Why? Because illness is the new in thing, people knows it gets attention and that others are often to scared to call out bullshit for fear of being called ableist. \n\nI was born with 2 different things wrong with me and they have impacted me all my life. If anything I went the other way when younger and would push myself to do things and suffer the consequences later. Because I knew that otherwise I'd live a shit life and would slowly be alienated from groups because of the Debbie downer effect. As I've got older I've learned my limits. Yes I really want to do thing a, but I'll suffer for 3 days afterwards and now being an adult with bills and such, that after impact on my life isn't worth it. How about you lot do thing a and well all do thing b tomorrow? Now all my friends that I hang with all know what's wrong with me, my medication and where to find it, and the best people or docs to call of anything does happen. And as my friend groups have aged and others have developed illnesses or other with illness have come into the group, it's something that we all know about each other because we have to. \n\nOne woman was ousted from the friend group because of Sadie like behaviour. Couldn't possibly do this or that because meds...illness disability...but is perfectly fine doing anything she wants to do. The type that never wakes up with a flare up, but suddenly develops one when they don't want to do something. And that flare up will suddenly go away when the activities change to something they find more desirable. \n\nSo if I were op, I wouldn't apologise. I would however call the bullshit and explain why.

But I can\u2019t renew a week early, so some would run out before the end of the week. I\u2019d still have my alerts on the phone to call to renew them, but I know myself and I\u2019d get confused easily by it all. \n\nAs it is, I only need like three minutes to organize my pills for the day.

I tried to ask for more details on the medication she takes and her condition in general, but she said that she doesn\u2019t share any of that information with anyone but her closest friends as the symptoms can sometimes be embarrassing.\n\nNTA.  The simple fact, that not even Sadie can argue with, is that when it's something Sadie wants to do, she deals with whatever \"embarrassing side effects\" her medications have, but when it's something someone else wants to do, f_ck them. Obviously these side effects aren't bad enough to stop her from taking the medication when it's an activity she enjoys, but they are too severe to deal with in order for anything her friends want to do.  This is what's called an one-sided relationship, and I don't engage in those.  If you want to, that's fine, but no matter how your conversation goes one Friday and the horror show she paints about her side effects remember what she already showed you, that on her day to plan she was perfectly fine, but all she's willing to do the rest of her time to maintain her friendships is put up with you until she has a flare up and then f_ck everyone else, how much they wanted to do this, how much they spent, none of it matters because none of you are as important as she is.", "Esh!  You're not compatible travel companions.  She's not willing to do your activities.  She has a very good excuse though and it's impossible to know her health.  If she wasn't committed to doing something to the point she was willing to risk derealing it she should have been honest and not booked to be your partner.  You can't get mad at her for having a health issue and not be able to continue without looking like an AH.  I suggest you apologize for your anger but tell her that you won't be her travel partner again is simply costing you too much money and free time.  Last,  the comment of you'll not being close enough to disclose her medication would mean to me we aren't close enough to travel.", "Can ESH here? Like you sounded rude talking to her, but she shouldn't have come if she couldn't handle it.\n\nThere's a happy medium between being practical and being ableist. You were sounding ableist and she wasn't very practical.", "ESH\n\nOkay so yes, first, your frustration is totally valid. To have plans disrupted by this person\u2019s failure to work properly with her disability is shitty. By your edit, it seems like you\u2019ve already figured out your response you this frustration was also shitty. \n\nUnlike most of the comments I read, I am not convinced she is doing it intentionally or even to be unconsciously manipulative. She does, though, need therapy from someone who knows how to work with chronically ill and disabled folks. \n\nWith a variable disability like hers (how bad it is can vary day-to-day or even more frequently), it means that some activities are likely to be harder than others. When she is planning, she knows what she can and can\u2019t do and how to work around challenges. When someone else is planning, this gets harder, especially if she\u2019s not comfortable talking about the specific challenges she faces. This is where therapy helps, because continuing like she is and screwing everyone over in the process is just setting her up to fail everyone, including herself. She needs to learn how to make group activities work just like ones she has planned, or she needs to learn how to be okay not being involved. This is HARD and requires grieving a healthy body and accepting limitations and strengths, but she\u2019s never going to be a good companion to anybody if she doesn\u2019t. \n\nBut I guess just please keep in mind that though it may look intentional or manipulative when her health is better during her parts, that might just be because she plans things she can handle. It\u2019s also worth considering having her driving portion be flexible, a \u201chey, I\u2019m up for an hour right now, let\u2019s do it\u201d so that her chances of helping drive are optimized, IF you ever do go on a trip with her again.", "I'm in the middle. ESH. (Soft)\n\nMaybe a calmer, direct, less harsh conversation needed to be had. \n\nI'm also disabled.\nManaged by meds.\nI know, 100% it sucks to sit it out.\nI can't  keep up, no matter how much I want to go? I don't. \nSide effects are too much and I don't want to take my medication? I don't go.\nI want to go desperately? I take the meds and deal with the side effects, prepare myself for them, make sure my friends are aware if I need accommodations for anything.\nIt's a choice I have to make. I'm responsible for managing it, and I've got to keep other people in mind, too, it IS a big deal with situations like this.  \n\nI'd have chosen differently if she was managing her condition and doing her best, and the condition was flaring up anyway. But, unfortunately,  that's not the case.\n\nIt's not ableist, in this circumstance. She shouldn't have called you that.\nThe activity required she take them, she NEEDS them to participate, she chose to participate. expecting her to manage her condition, and being frustrated when she chooses not to, and yet chooses to come, costs everyone money, willfully/knowingly, is understandable.", "I was just diagnosed with hEDS with my main affected joints being in the lower extremities. One of my favorite activities with friends/family is going to the nearby theme park. Even with meds, the standing and walking all day can be pretty brutal. I know this. Friends know this. Family knows this. I make sure to wear good shoes, stay hydrated, and get plenty of rest the night before. They make sure we take frequent breaks, especially after standing in line for a while. If I need extra time to rest, I certainly don\u2019t mind sitting out for a ride or two. Someone usually ends up staying with me on their own accord to also have a longer break. Sometimes I will just endure the pain for a short time if I know we\u2019re going to eat or otherwise rest directly after. \n\nThat\u2019s how you live with a chronic condition. Everyone has to play their part. One person \u201cforgetting\u201d meds and forcing the others to quit the activity isn\u2019t how you treat people you\u2019re supposed to care about.", "I wouldn't be here friend.", "I don\u2019t think OP is TA at all; I think her friend definitely is though. \n\nI don\u2019t have a chronic physical illness, but I\u2019m bipolar and have to take medication everyday to manage it. Prior to being diagnosed, I had periods of extreme volatility that were hell for me *and* the people around me. Is it OK for me to deliberately forgo the tools necessary to keep those episodes at bay when I am on notice that doing so will adversely affect everyone around me? Absolutely not!\n\nIt\u2019s not her fault that she has an illness, but it is her fault if she neglects to manage it when she is on notice that doing so is harmful to herself and others, and chooses to go on a trip with others. The fact that she is intentional about taking it on days when she picked the activity shows that it is deliberate. If it were a legitimate accident, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily be TA, though it would still be irresponsible. Conversely, if she was doing all she could to manage her symptoms but still has a flare up, she would not be at fault.\n\nIn summary: neglecting to take your medication is selfish if you are notice that your off-meds behavior is negatively affecting other people. Your friend is even worse because she\u2019s weaponizing her illness to manipulate you into apologizing - she guilt trips others to assert her dominance.", "Disagree with your reluctance. Apparently Sadie doesn't consider them close as she won't divulge to OP her symptoms, side effects, or issues as that is something Sadie \"only shares with close friends\". And if I've spent money and time on a trip that gets upended because of someone else's issues that they refuse to do anything about, then I am not going to be very sympathetic. Add to that OP lost probably hundreds of dollars on their planned excursion because Sadie couldn't do horseback riding, then OP has every right to be upset.", "I\u2019m also the lodge squatter! I love it lol", "If she doesn\u2019t consider you close enough friends for her to tell you the medical information that directly impacts your participation in the vacation, even in general terms, I wouldn\u2019t consider her close enough of a friend to travel with. \n\nThat was the part that put me into NTA. It seems like a very one way friendship. Especially silly combined with \u201cI can manage to remember my meds when it impacts something I want to do but not when it\u2019s something other people want to do.\u201d", "Same here, plus medicationt akes time to build up in your system I can't think of a single medication or illness that is magically fixed by one single pill.", "I was thinking maybe she\u2019s insulin dependent. And there is quite a large span of what that can mean; LADA, MODY, Type 1, Type 2. Being diabetic is considered a disability as it requires a constant management system. My son was diagnosed as a baby and we also do all of his care through a cell phone so it\u2019s very discrete now. But anybody\u2019s guess is as good as mine \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Wish she would talk with you all more about her flare up triggers, because shopping in a town is pretty low impact, likely lots of ac, likely even bathroom access. Perhaps she has IBS or chrons, would explain why her activity didn't cause as much of a flare up because she had a more comfortable environment. Maybe she and the group need to better discuss group activities that lend better or her illness and then also realize not everyone needs to do every single thing together. Maybe more trips you focus on some shared and other split activities or better focusing some around her triggers? Like maybe she needs to drive first in the future? Who knows! I'm sure some things can be adjusted better with more information.", "It sounds very isolating : (\n\nI have a friend with Lupus who doesn't go out much because of the pain.", "That... Makes me sad. I have a friend who really wanted to hang but couldn't go out eating or mall crawling because she had very little energy. I picked her up and drove her to my place, and we played videogames for a few hours. I've had friends who were flat broke and I paid their way if I wanted to do shit like go to the movies. If someone is truly important to you and you to them, be they disabled or whatever, you'll find a happy medium. That's how i feel about it anyway.", "As someone who has chronic and sometimes debilitating flare ups of various illnesses, I think I would legitimately rather cut off an arm or something than be a millstone around my friends\u2019 necks like Sadie is being. For someone disabled, especially someone who has a chronic illness, there is almost nothing worse than the feeling of ruining something for someone because your health failed. Doing that repeatedly? At that point atomize me and remove my very existence from all reality because living with the shame of that would be so miserable. Ableist? Hah!", "Could you imagine expecting all your friends to not do a ski weekend at all? Or worse\u2026 Do a ski weekend, then not be able to ski at all? The nerve.", "No, I think OP expected Sadie to know what she can manage and what she can't, especially since her excuse is that she \"forgot,\" not that she can't take it every day.", "Exactly. Every one seems to be glossing over the fact OP not only couldn't do their planned excursion on their assigned day but they also lost probably HUNDREDS of dollars on it. And somehow OP is just supposed to put up with it? I call BS. I like to think I'm a nice person and I can certainly understand someone getting ill unexpectedly but Sadie PURPOSELY is costing OP money and doesn't care. So, yes, Sadie should simply quit coming on trips where her lack of being able to do something financially affects other people.", "It\u2019s the \u201ccommunicating\u201d part for me. We\u2019re only hearing OP\u2019s side, but it sounds like Sadie is -not- communicating.", "Any sympathy for Sadie is rightfully drowned out by her lack of respect for anyone else. And anyone else's money. I know that horseback ride excursion was not cheap (because they never are) so OP lost out on probably hundreds of dollars because of Sadie. The fact it was also OP's excursion day is icing on the cake.", "I love a ski weekend. The vibes are immaculate. I even like to ski but I get awful raynauds so I only do a half day like one day during the entire time we go and I can\u2019t imagine being the one to tell all my friends that because I can\u2019t or choose not to ski that they can\u2019t either. I\u2019d be so embarrassed", "Yessssss, exactly what I was thinking. She has legit medical issues and \\*also\\* she seems to be...manipulating them into making everything revolve around her. Why the hell don't you have alarms set up every day? Anyone can set that up in their phone now to go off at the same time daily.", "OP also brushes aside Sadie's comment about not understanding what she goes through while on medication so I'm getting a vibe from the post that OP and maybe others haven't really been willing to be accommodating to Sadie or listen to her when she says she can't take her medication all the time. OP admits she has no clue what Sadie's condition is or if the meds have side effects, but still gives off vibes like she thinks there's a super simple solution to all of their problems and it's Sadie taking her meds, and if Sadie doesnt take them all of the time she's being a jerk who is purposefully ruining their plans. \n\nI would not be shocked if \"I forgot\" was really after a few times where Sadie purposefully didn't take them because of side effects and \"friends\" like OP who couldn't be bothered to educate themselves got on her case about purposefully sabotaging their plans by not taking the medication", "I remember being a kid in the 80s who wanted to go on a week long school trip. My parents were really worried about me forgetting my medication. My dad got me a pager watch (it was a rugrats one...I thought itbwas the coolest thing ever!)  They paged me several times a day at medication time. I honestly thought I was the shniz! Bear in mind it was like a good decade before mobile phones were properly available.", "Right. I could see if she forgot to take her meds through her trip and even on her activity day. But it was only when she didn't want to do something. However I feel like they shouldn't keep taking her if they are going to keep wasting money. Even if it was truly an accident they want to have a good time. They shouldn't have to do that every time they take a trip.", "It was Sadie who said that she \"forgot,\" right up until OP let her know that was not an acceptable excuse.  I think that the complaint about side effects was invented then.  If it was true, why didn't she say that she wasn't up to this or that activity?  She didn't have to go into details.  And that is also not an acceptable excuse for ruining other people's activities.", "Do you think that is an age thing? As in the older you get you weigh up the pros and cons a lot more than when you were younger? \nI ask because I've been ill for years (since I was born but gotten worse over time as things do) \nLike I absolutely love ice-skating. I'm crap at it as I have movement disorders.  But I love it. It does however really hurt me to do it. So I plan carefully when to.do.it. I will only do it when I visit my mum as that's my downtime, not working time. And I'll only do it on a Sunday as I know the kids (nieces and nephews who are attached to me when I visit) are in school so I'll have till 3pm on the Monday to recover.  Stay in bed if I need etc.\nWhen I was younger I'd go skating then do something on the way back then be up early...until my body would give out and I'd be basically passed out for 3 days.\nSo now I plan it. Once a year on a specific day, so I can recover.\n\nSo I'm starting to think its an age thing. The pros and cons of living with disabilities. I'd rather not waste my limited physical ability doing something I might only mildly enjoy.  Instead I'll knacker myself doing something I deem amazing"]}
