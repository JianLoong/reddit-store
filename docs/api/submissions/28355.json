From the latino partner side they included some beautiful wedding traditions that I\u2019ve never gotten to see or previously gotten to learn about, and from the white partner side they included traditions I\u2019m more familiar with.  While the officiant spoke in English, their ceremony was dotted by family member readings (non-religious couple, so think replacing reading bible scriptures at a Christian wedding).  Since the family obviously included Spanish speaking persons, there were entire pieces orated in Spanish, which a large percentage of those attending did not speak, and also pieces in english, which another large percentage may not have spoken.  What the couple did was create a wedding ceremony program handed out to guests as they were seated, and it included all spoken pieces in both english and spanish, plus naming the wedding party and immediate family for everyone.  The ceremony was beautiful, tasteful, and the prevailing emotions where those of love and happiness (which doesn\u2019t require verbalization to be seen or felt).  The speeches done in spanish sounded musical to my monolingual ear, and they essentially had given us subtitles to understand each other.

Someone complains about language? \"I'm sorry, I thought this was America where we don't have a nation language\".  Someone making racial stereotypes? \"I'm sorry, I thought this was America where it is legal to be ________\"", "I believe that is spelled Murica.", "oh man,\n\nI fought my parents reflexive racism for DECADES. They just could not get that saying racist crap about strangers included the people they knew in real life that they cared about who were also part of that group. Then get big mad when you pointed out that racist pejorative also included our sweet neighbor Alice since she was also insert group here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, you are making the right call to die on this hill.", "Just think, if the brides family was paying for everything and decided that the whole ceremony would be in Spanish! Bet you, that would go over \"like a turd in a punchbowl\"!!", "My favorite fight for this (note: I am white and know a couple Spanish phrases but nothing even conversational) is that people who speak broken English SPEAK MORE LANGUAGES THAN YOU. Especially to people who say that people speaking broke English sound stupid. They\u2019re literally smarter than you when it comes to language.", "I'm surprised to get this far into the thread before someone said this.", "Well the only fair answer is to have the whole thing done in Klingon so nobody understands equally!", "I just had Dax and Worf\u2019s wedding flash before my eyes.", "Do the whole ceremony in Spanish and only give your friends the translated pamphlets.", "Oh that would be really sweet.", "Shit, that's not just cute, it's poetic. Put that in the climax of your romance movie, and you're automatically nominated for an Oscar.", "*He* has *Her* back.\ud83d\ude0a", "Bro you're from Texas?? Your parents are double assholes being from a border state that USED TO BE PART OF MEXICO. There's a reason people in those areas say the phrase \"I didn't cross the border, the border crossed me\". They're giving off a \"this is America speak English\" vibe meanwhile no part of the US has ever had an official language, but the official language in Texas was once Spanish (still colonizer language but just showing white American xenophobia)", "It was in the first sentence.", "Your FIL is a keeper", "Omg can we all get your fil as a dad or fil?!?! How sweet!!", "I hope that they realize that they\u2019re out of line and embrace the whole wedding. It\u2019s really unfortunate that their ignorance is casting a shadow on your day. But you\u2019re absolutely doing the right thing.", "btw OP - whether they \"look\" mexican or not, they'll also *culturally* be Mexican and your family will resent that as well. what happens when your kids start throwing out some Spanglish that they learned from their Mexican grandparents in front of their white grandparents? will your family tell them \"speak English outside the house! This is America\"?", "If they think it's pandering, have the ceremony in German so everybody loses.", "\u201cpander\u201d pissed me off! \nHow about \u201crespect\u201d your future wife and her family and have a full on bilingual ceremony so everyone knows what is being said and can be fully invested?!? Sounds like OP is fully invested but his family needs to be a tad more \u201cinconvenienced\u201d during the ceremony so that the bride\u2019s family is acknowledged.  \n\nNTA", "Are you my ex? Family pretended to like me then convinced him the wedding didn\u2019t count the day after the wedding (he was also at fault for going along with it, and I was at fault for being so stupid). Had to get an annulment", "I\u2019d put money on them saying to themselves \u201cwe like her, she\u2019s not like other Mexicans\u201d", "We did the usual religious vows even though we aren't religious to appease hubby's VERY religious grandma. No skin off my teeth, because we also added in extra vows that we both wrote (although we both forgot the slips of paper and had to wing it. I at least memorized mine but there are photos of the Best Man saving my husband's ass by reading his own vows to him to recite while trying to hide behind a pole lmfao It was amazing)", "Well, now I know what I'm adding to my vows... I think my partner will find that particularly amusing. Since we're both fond of crime dramas.", "and it's so common these days for people to be merging religions or cultures in weddings that it's normal for guests not to understand 100% of what is happening at a wedding.", "They also have several months to learn Spanish. They should get busy.", "NIMBYs.", "Yeah, I was gonna' say that's not \"low key\" at all all, that \"key\" is as high as Snoop Dogg!", "Their whole goal is to change that.", "They both looked stunning in their wedding attire, the costume department really outdid themselves!", "I figured he was going to boo them", "I didn\u2019t at all take that as sympathy for their views lol. Nowhere is that implied. Dude is disappointed that his family is acting like trash and that they\u2019d be shitty enough people that he may not have his own family at his wedding. It\u2019s not disappointment that he can\u2019t have racists, it\u2019s disappointment that these people let him down.", "That\u2019s (sort of) what a relative did! One family wanted it in the Greek church, the other family in the Macedonian so the couple got married in a garden ceremony with a\u2026 gasp \u2026female celebrant!", "That would be panzering then.", "Damn, that's awful. \n\nThankfully OP doesn't seem be going along with it, which is a good sign for their marriage. He just needs to be aware this probably isn't the end of this issue and needs to continue to stand with her, even if that means cutting his family out eventually if they continue this kind of behavior.", "OP probably has a savior complex. She asked him. She should have told him. Of course you do something in the brides language.", "This i would have loved to see, it sounds hilarious \ud83e\udd23. Best man was really MVP lol", "Not having been raised Catholic, I\u2019ve been to some of those weddings *all in English* that I still don\u2019t understand what is going on! I just try to kneel, sit and stand when everyone else does! Lol", "Great response. There\u2019s a solution to their problem!", "Had to google. Not In My Back Yard. I love learning new things! Thank you!", "This.", "[deleted]", "I have two where you can tell what he's up to \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 The photographer did her best not to include him while he read them off his phone. I plan on getting the most obvious one framed and hung up soon", "You're welcome!", "Which is a normal reaction to finding out that your family is choosing racism over you and your partner.", "Yes. I too would feel sad if my family was that trashy and I had to cut them off or they didn\u2019t go to my wedding. Nobody is sad for the missing their racism, nobody is sad that there are consequences to their actions \u2026 it\u2019s sadness that you end up alone on what should have been a happy event because the family you didn\u2019t get to choose turns out to be trash humans while other people get to have supportive families around them for significant life events.", "Ha! That poor photographer, but I'm so glad you got at least two. You definitely need to hang that one up \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
