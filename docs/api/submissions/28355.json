Because most of Valentina's family is still in Mexico and a lot of them can't speak English (even Valentina struggles with the language's intricacies from time to time), Valentina asked me if we could have part of the ceremony in Spanish.

I will however suggest why not just have a translator there so that everyone can hear all of it?  Repeat the lines in both languages, everyone gets to hear and understand.

You think someone concerned about racism would be more aware of what a dog whistle is.
