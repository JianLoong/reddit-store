There are two ways to do that:\n\n1. Pay for a repair that is invisible.  It's got to be a top quality repair otherwise a formerly smart shirt has become a second best shirt.   *OR*\n2. Buy you a replacement shirt that is the same as the ripped one.  It doesn't matter how much the replacement shirt costs - it could have been on sale for \u00a320, or the price could have gone up to \u00a3119.  He owes you the same or virtually identical shirt.\n\nBut it's **his** choice which route he goes down first.  Since he's opted for the cheaper route, you are only entitled to reject the repaired shirt if the quality of the repair isn't good enough.  If that's the case, only then can you ask for a totally new shirt.\n\nYou are TA because you took the decision to go for the expensive option first.

If it can\u2019t, then possibly reimburse for the original cost of the shirt. I think making them pay for the increased cost of a new shirt is over stepping..", "Yes, YTA.

Destroying your clothing isn\u2019t funny, the fact that he did it while you were wearing the shirt makes things worse. You won\u2019t get the money, and you know that.
