I moved in with him and we had a 7 year relationship. I had my son a few weeks before my 19th birthday. \n\nOur relationship wasn't perfect, but I benefitted from it a lot as Henry put me through college and helped me manage my bipolar disorder. Although we are no longer together, I still love and respect him as a good friend and a good father to our little rascal. \n\nAbout a year ago, I reconnected with my family by accident. I moved a few cities away from my mother, but I happened to run into her in our state capital. She burst into tears when she saw me, and told me that she had been searching for me for years but she couldn't find me. We've been meeting 2-4 times a month and I introduced her to my son four months ago. She naturally wanted to know about his father, but she is a very traditional woman and I didn't want to ruin whatever progress I had made with her by telling her about the man I had a relationship with who's two decades older than me. She is also only five years older than him and it would be awkward. \n\nShe is becoming insistent on me introducing her to his father even though she knows we aren't together, and she's saying that I'm acting in bad faith for not telling her about him. According to her, the whole point of reconciliation is to become family again, and hiding the identity of my child's father goes against that.

You sharing it gives you a better chance at sharing your fully story with all of its context. \n\nIt feels like you are afraid of losing the relationship you have with your mother now.

No guilt in just staying away.\n\nHere's what I read, \"whole point of reconciliation is to become family again, and hiding the identity of my child's father goes against that.\" That is what we call manipulation. The \"I'm acting in bad faith,\" is low level guilting to get her way. Notice, in everything, you are the problem for choosing not to share. That's all gaslighting. She should respect your boundaries.\n\nYou are an adult. Don't let them try to force you into anything you don't want. You get to share what and how much you share.

Tell her it's not up for discussion, and has nothing to do with re-connection with family.  Is she still with the stepfather who wanted you gone?

A thousand horrible things could've happened to you, and it would have been HER fault for choosing her husband over you. \n\nNow that you are back in contact, she does not get to dictate the terms. You have proven that you can live without her and thrive on your own. She is the one who should be grateful you are in contact with her at all, and she should realize what a merciful GIFT you have given her by even entertaining contact with her. It doesn't matter what choices you made, she does not GET to disagree with them or judge them, because you did what you had to do to SURVIVE after being thrown out by the person who is supposed to love you most. \n\nIf it were me, I'd tell her everything. Because like I said, you made your choices based on what you had to do because you were abandoned. If she has any judgment in her about those decisions, I'd remind her that none of it would have happened if she hadn't given up on you. But maybe I'm just petty. \n\nBe true to yourself, set any boundaries you believe are necessary for your well-being, and stand your ground.

If your mom becomes part of your life, she will presumably meet him.  And at that point his father isn't going to have a secret identity any more.\n\nMy suggestion is that if your mom can't accept you for who you are, including your history with your ex, then she doesn't deserve to be in your life or your child's life.  I think that before she meets your child and he can form any attachment to her, it might be good to share in order to be sure that she isn't once again the cruel, rejecting, judgmental person she was when she threw you out as a teenager.\n\nIf she can embrace you as you are, where you stand, with the history of overcoming the terrible hardships of family rejection and moving forward in your life to the really good place you're in now, great.  If she can't, don't put it down to conservative values.  Put it down to the level of character flaw that richly deserves you going NC with her and protecting your kid from her.\n\nNTA, so so many kudos for taking your life in this positive direction despite being thrown out with untreated bipolar disorder 12 years ago.

If anything you're currently not sharing makes her want to repeat her decision to abandon you *you do not want her in your life.*\n\nFundamentally you should refuse to compromise with her.

You have no obligation to tell her anything about your life.  She lost all rights when she kicked you out and basically walked away from you as a mother.  This is about what you want not what she wants and the terms of how you want to reconcile.  The fact that you are hesitant speaks to the fact that you believe she is going to reject you again.  Tell her that you do not trust her given her past actions.  Traditional or not she was not a mom to you and frankly I would hesitate to have her be in your child\u2019s life as she can just as brutally reject him in the future if he is not as she needs him to be.

She kicked you out for a man, so she doesn\u2019t get to insist on anything and her being considered family again is still under consideration.  I would say that to her face.

She will have to wait until she has shown by her actions that she deserves your trust but that this is your call & not hers. \nBe sure to take the time to reflect on your interactions with her & that her being back in your life is mutually beneficial.
