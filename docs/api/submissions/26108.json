I moved in with him and we had a 7 year relationship. I had my son a few weeks before my 19th birthday. \n\nOur relationship wasn't perfect, but I benefitted from it a lot as Henry put me through college and helped me manage my bipolar disorder. Although we are no longer together, I still love and respect him as a good friend and a good father to our little rascal. \n\nAbout a year ago, I reconnected with my family by accident. I moved a few cities away from my mother, but I happened to run into her in our state capital. She burst into tears when she saw me, and told me that she had been searching for me for years but she couldn't find me. We've been meeting 2-4 times a month and I introduced her to my son four months ago. She naturally wanted to know about his father, but she is a very traditional woman and I didn't want to ruin whatever progress I had made with her by telling her about the man I had a relationship with who's two decades older than me. She is also only five years older than him and it would be awkward. \n\nShe is becoming insistent on me introducing her to his father even though she knows we aren't together, and she's saying that I'm acting in bad faith for not telling her about him. According to her, the whole point of reconciliation is to become family again, and hiding the identity of my child's father goes against that.

You sharing it gives you a better chance at sharing your fully story with all of its context. \n\nIt feels like you are afraid of losing the relationship you have with your mother now.

No guilt in just staying away.\n\nHere's what I read, \"whole point of reconciliation is to become family again, and hiding the identity of my child's father goes against that.\" That is what we call manipulation. The \"I'm acting in bad faith,\" is low level guilting to get her way. Notice, in everything, you are the problem for choosing not to share. That's all gaslighting. She should respect your boundaries.\n\nYou are an adult. Don't let them try to force you into anything you don't want. You get to share what and how much you share.

Tell her it's not up for discussion, and has nothing to do with re-connection with family.  Is she still with the stepfather who wanted you gone?

A thousand horrible things could've happened to you, and it would have been HER fault for choosing her husband over you. \n\nNow that you are back in contact, she does not get to dictate the terms. You have proven that you can live without her and thrive on your own. She is the one who should be grateful you are in contact with her at all, and she should realize what a merciful GIFT you have given her by even entertaining contact with her.

Because like I said, you made your choices based on what you had to do because you were abandoned. If she has any judgment in her about those decisions, I'd remind her that none of it would have happened if she hadn't given up on you. But maybe I'm just petty. \n\nBe true to yourself, set any boundaries you believe are necessary for your well-being, and stand your ground.

If your mom becomes part of your life, she will presumably meet him.  And at that point his father isn't going to have a secret identity any more.\n\nMy suggestion is that if your mom can't accept you for who you are, including your history with your ex, then she doesn't deserve to be in your life or your child's life.  I think that before she meets your child and he can form any attachment to her, it might be good to share in order to be sure that she isn't once again the cruel, rejecting, judgmental person she was when she threw you out as a teenager.\n\nIf she can embrace you as you are, where you stand, with the history of overcoming the terrible hardships of family rejection and moving forward in your life to the really good place you're in now, great.  If she can't, don't put it down to conservative values.

Doesn't matter.  I respect their right to make their decisions, because they are adults now.  If they aren't asking for advice, I do not give it.  **The way a parent shows love to their grown child is to respect them,** even if they make choices you don't like.  \n\nYour mother, if she so chooses, can love you, even if she doesn't approve of your choices.  Some parents will only 'love' you if you are compliant, but that's making love transactional, and it's not love; it's control.\n\n*She is becoming insistent on me introducing her to his father even though she knows we aren't together, and she's saying that I'm acting in bad faith for not telling her about him.* \n\n**This is not her decision to make.**  \n\nYour life as an adult is for you to make the decisions about, not her.   **She doesn't get to demand from you.  That's wrong.**  She doesn't get to tell you what to do.  Parents are active until you are an adult.  Then they are supposed to let go and not be in control anymore.   Your mother is trying to pick up where she left off, when you were a child she did wrong to by kicking you out.  **She's trying to put herself in authority over you, as if your decisions are hers to make.  She's wrong** to do this.  \n\nYou are not 'in bad faith' to not tell her something. She's using these words to try to manipulate you.  She's the one wrong, to demand you tell her.  **You have absolute right to decide that any topic is not a topic that you will discuss with her.**  Your decisions are yours, not hers.\n\nIt goes this way:  ***You*** **decide.**  You **state your decision** to her.  You **restate it** when she tries to force you to explain or justify or defend it; and you don't explain your reasons, because you do not have to.  And then, you **don't discuss it.**  That's it.  **If she won't respect that, end the discussion and be done for that day.**   You can teach yourself an **exit strategy,** which is just knowing in advance something to do or say to leave the situation and protect yourself from being manipulated. You do not have to stay and be badgered into compliance.\n\nNext time she brings it up, say \"we aren't discussing this.\"  If she brings it up again, **end the conversation and be done for that week.**  **Repeat as needed** with a longer time out each time.\n\n*According to her, the whole point of reconciliation is to become family again,* \n\nFamily is supposed to support you and love you, and that means  **treating you better than the rest of the world.**   \n\nYours failed you once already, hugely.  Has she admitted her wrongs in that?  Has she shown remorse for that?  Does she admit that she hurt you deeply, and that you owe her nothing now, because of that?

She's wrong.  **You making a decision to not discuss your child's father has nothing to do with building a new healthy relationship with her.**  \n\nHer, on the other hand, insisting you give her information that you told her 'no' about, **that's her being manipulative and emotionally abusive to you**, refusing to accept your decision, refusing to accept it when you say 'no', trying to manipulate you into compliance with her wants, disrespecting you as an adult.  I could go on.  **She's the one tearing apart the reconciliation here,** not you.  ***She's the one destroying the relationship she claims to want, by refusing to give you respect*** as a person who makes their own decisions for their own life.\n\n*I don't know if I've been messed up by 12+years of no contact or if I'm being reasonable so I would like a third party opinion.* \n\n**You are being reasonable.**  You have the right to decide what to tell her, and what not to tell her.  You have the right to not have her meet people in your life, if you can't trust her.  Everything she's saying here is loaded with red flags that say to me, do not trust her.  \n\n**No contact doesn't mess you up**. **It frees you from the control** of the manipulative person.  It helps you see more clearly that the person isn't who they tried to convince you they were.  It helps you see more clearly that you are allowed to make your decisions, that you are allowed to be treated with respect, that manipulating you is wrong.  It gives you space to heal from the things they did to you.\n\nStand firm. She's wrong, very wrong, to have said these things to you.  You deserve better from her.

Refusing to leave an abuser because it would be hard after forcing your child to go through life on hard mode, and housing an abuser *over* your child, is not a stance anybody should be defending.

The only time they were receptive (and not openly hostile) was when I was in elementary and left them a note saying I wanted to commit endgame.

I went LC instead of NC.) It left a permanent psychic wound in my father. I'm... Not fully sorry about that. I know they tried their best. Their parents were worse to them. I acknowledge they did good things too (their regular modeling of activism is why I was brave and determined enough to start telling them off, ironically enough.) I have heard from my sister they brag about me. Their daughter who moved to the big city to teach \"poor disabled children\" how to read. It's a salve to soothe their ego. I let them have it. I don't think it would be productive to keep bringing up the lasting effects of how they treated me (like my on and off misuse of prescription drugs, starting when I was 15). They treat my sister better, I think, and they're still caring for her. They acknowledge the reason she hasn't left the house yet (she's nearly 30) is because they failed her.
