It\u2019s clear that your intentions were to protect and stand up for Joshua. However, the timing and setting of the confrontation might not have been ideal. Public confrontations, especially at an event that\u2019s important for the kids, can create additional stress and embarrassment for them. It\u2019s great that Joshua has found such a supportive friend in Nicholas, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d be upset by his mother\u2019s insensitive remarks.\n\nYour wife has a point about timing. Addressing the issue at a more appropriate time and in a calmer setting might have been more effective. It\u2019s also important to consider how your reaction affects Joshua. He might feel embarrassed or worried about the impact this could have on his relationship with Nicholas.\n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for standing up for your son, but it might be beneficial to reflect on how to handle similar situations in the future. Perhaps a private conversation with Nicholas\u2019 parents, explaining your perspective and how their comments affect Joshua, could be a way to resolve the tension without causing further distress.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
