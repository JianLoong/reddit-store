{"id": 19691, "submission_id": "149du0s", "title": "AITA for grounding my son over sunglasses?", "selftext": "My wife (33F) and I (33M) have 3 kids, a 14 year old daughter (Colleen), a 13 year old son (Kian) and a 11 year old son (Brent). The kids have just finished the school year and are on their summer break.\n\nWe always let the kids invite their friends over as long as they ask for permission, Kian is the one who invites his friends over the most frequently. Kian and his friends are the types of boys who spend all day, every day together. \n\nKain\u2019s friends are his baseball teammates and a few other athletic boys. One of Kian\u2019s teammates, Colter, is on the autism spectrum. \n\nColter is a very nice kid, he can be a bit awkward due to the autism, but is pretty social and very academically successful, as well being successful in baseball. Some of his traits are more prevalent than others, one of those being his sensory issues. My wife and I have talked to his parents on how we can best accommodate him. Colter also has ADHD, so he can sometimes forget to bring headphones and sunglasses, which is why we always have Kian store a few pairs in his drawer in case Colter forgets.\n\nA few days ago, all the boys were at our house when they decided they wanted to go to the mall. Before they left, Kian asked Colter to check for sunglasses and he didn\u2019t have them on him. Kian went to open his drawer to get a pair and didn\u2019t have any, which he thought was very odd given we had just bought some pairs and he had put them away around a week ago. Kian checked his room for a bit before giving up, a few of the boys ran to Dollar Tree to get some more temporary pairs until we could get better pairs while Colter and the remaining boys waited for them. After they came back, I got a call from them and drove them to the mall on my lunch hour.\n\nThat night, my wife and I went in Kian\u2019s room to help him search, we didn\u2019t find anything. We then suspected Brent had something to do with it, especially because Kian and Brent do not get along, it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on.\n\nMy wife asked if she could come in his room and look, Brent refused and after that I had to bribe him out while she searched, and she found broken pairs of sunglasses under some clothes. Brent admitted he did it because it was \u201cfunny\u201d to see \u201cColter acting like a baby\u201d because of his anxious reaction. We asked Brent to apologize but he refused.\n\nMy wife and I decided to ground him for 2 weeks for this, as well as trying to teach him more on autism by asking Colter for some resources. Colleen has been advocating for Brent saying that we are being unfair to him and saying we shouldn\u2019t ground him over \u201ca joke\u201d, Colleen is also much closer to Brent than Kian, like both my wife and I, Colleen and Brent have more \u201cnerdy\u201d interests like comics and science, which make Kian a bit more isolated, but again, we are working on it and always support him in his athletic journey. Colleen is being very insistent on saying we are being too hard on Brent.

Colleen is a dumbass teen (respectfully speaking) and you need to teach your child Brent discipline. Don't raise a bully.", "NTA\n\nI'd say just intentionally breaking anyone's sunglasses is enough to get grounded, but this is even a little worse because not only did he do it on purpose, but he did it specifically to upset Colter.  He was bullying him.  Seems like a reasonable punishment, if you don't punish him at all then he's not going to learn not to do it again.\n\nAlso, your daughter seems nice and everything but I don't think her opinion really factors into the decision here.", "NTA. Brent is destroying property and displaying intolerant and ableist behavior.  If you relent, it's telling him that you find it acceptable.  The purpose of punishment is to prevent a reaccourance.", "NTA - He destroyed his brothers property. It's not a joke.  This is deliberately mean for the sake of it, and it sounds like he is jealous of Kian if I am being 100% honest.  I think you handled this well, especially being so sensitive to Colts' feelings as a child on the spectrum and trying to teach your son more empathy towards such.\n\nIf he had just hid the glasses, it would be different.  He destroyed them and hid the evidence, what is funny about that?", "NTA, your kid said rude things about the autistic friend and he has to learn that it\u2019s not okay to do so. Totally reasonable and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NTA.  Colleen is not a parent, you and your wife are.  Brent deserves some sort of punishment.", "NTA you didn\u2019t ground him over sunglasses, you grounded him for bullying another child. It sounds like your daughter could benefit from learning about autistics as well.", "NTA, he needs a lesson and he can take this time to learn more about autism and why hes not \u201cacting like a baby\u201d", "NTA it was a bully move and he should be punished. There was no joke here.", "NTA. I would explain to Colleen that this was more than a joke.", "NTA. \n\nIf it\u2019s done to be hurtful, it\u2019s not a joke. He\u2019s a bully and needs to have consequences.", "NTA, it's your job as a parent to guide your kids and sometimes that includes disciplining them. What Brent did was bullying and he needs to learn that he was in the wrong", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is too young to understand how insensitive her brother's actions were. Joke or not, he could end up really hurting someone one day.\n\nAlso, just based on this post, y'all sound like amazing parents. The fact that you even listen to your kids and consider their input is proof.", "NTA. They\u2019re kids and kids play pranks\u2026but Brent designed the \u201cprank\u201d to target Colter\u2019s autism, using it to get a reaction out of him. That makes it bullying. It\u2019s also destroying what belongs to Kian.\n\nYou\u2019ve responded appropriately and you seem like great parents to take measures to accommodate your children\u2019s friends!", "He didn't hide the glasses: he broke them, and then hid the pieces.\n\nHe could have just hidden the glasses if it was actually a joke, but it was never intended to be.  \n\nI think he broke them, then felt Shame and hid the results of his crime.  If you hadn't found them, they'd be tossed out, none the wiser.\n\nNTA", "\u201cI had to bribe him out while she searched\u201d WTF? You need parenting classes, OP.

What he did was NOT funny and he needs to learn that. It also sounds like your daughter may need to be a little more educated on Colter's disabilities. Causing an autistic person to have a negative reaction on purpose is cruel and the furthest thing from a \"joke\".", "NTA.\n\nI would ground his butt as well. Sister can keep her nosy self out of the situation. I would do some social stories type of work with your son on bullying, and seeing how it goes before moving on. IMO, it is inappropriate to have Colter be the resource & force an interaction. You need to find your own resources.\n\nHowever, all behavior is communication.  If you were to dive deeper into this, I bet dollars to donuts both your daughter & son are annoyed by friends, especially Colter, taking over their house -- their safe space.  That might be why your daughter is backing up Brent, b/c she feels the same way, just had the impulse control to make better decisions.\n\nI would encourage communication & encourage YOU to listen. I suspect they have been saying something about how they don't like other kids over (or specifically Colter), and been shut down and told to suck it up.  It is EASY to cater to the more outgoing child & tell the other kids to suck it up.  \\*I\\* enjoy having  a busy house that is crazy, but 2 out of my 4 kids canNOT deal with the hot mess express a pile of adhd boys can dish. Sometimes? Yes. Everyday? No.", "NTA! \n\nOmg! How absolutely cruel to bait a kid with autism into a fit or tantrum or whatever else words the kid used to do to get a reaction. \n\nFinally.. some parents who dole out proper consequences for actions that the kids do that are not appropriate behaviors in society. Stick to the grounding and the child will THINK next time before treating someone that way.", "NTA. You and your wife sound like good parents. It\u2019s nice to hear a post from a couple who are solidly on the same team.", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't break other people's property period, not just because Colter has austism, brent just should know it's wrong to smash another person's things.\n\nBrent and Colten don't really have to get along, do they? They are not in the same friendship group, I wonder why they don't though? Did something happen between them?"]}
