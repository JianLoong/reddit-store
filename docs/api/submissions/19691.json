{"id": 19691, "submission_id": "149du0s", "title": "AITA for grounding my son over sunglasses?", "selftext": "My wife (33F) and I (33M) have 3 kids, a 14 year old daughter (Colleen), a 13 year old son (Kian) and a 11 year old son (Brent). The kids have just finished the school year and are on their summer break.\n\nWe always let the kids invite their friends over as long as they ask for permission, Kian is the one who invites his friends over the most frequently. Kian and his friends are the types of boys who spend all day, every day together. \n\nKain\u2019s friends are his baseball teammates and a few other athletic boys. One of Kian\u2019s teammates, Colter, is on the autism spectrum. \n\nColter is a very nice kid, he can be a bit awkward due to the autism, but is pretty social and very academically successful, as well being successful in baseball. Some of his traits are more prevalent than others, one of those being his sensory issues. My wife and I have talked to his parents on how we can best accommodate him. Colter also has ADHD, so he can sometimes forget to bring headphones and sunglasses, which is why we always have Kian store a few pairs in his drawer in case Colter forgets.\n\nA few days ago, all the boys were at our house when they decided they wanted to go to the mall. Before they left, Kian asked Colter to check for sunglasses and he didn\u2019t have them on him. Kian went to open his drawer to get a pair and didn\u2019t have any, which he thought was very odd given we had just bought some pairs and he had put them away around a week ago. Kian checked his room for a bit before giving up, a few of the boys ran to Dollar Tree to get some more temporary pairs until we could get better pairs while Colter and the remaining boys waited for them. After they came back, I got a call from them and drove them to the mall on my lunch hour.\n\nThat night, my wife and I went in Kian\u2019s room to help him search, we didn\u2019t find anything. We then suspected Brent had something to do with it, especially because Kian and Brent do not get along, it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on.\n\nMy wife asked if she could come in his room and look, Brent refused and after that I had to bribe him out while she searched, and she found broken pairs of sunglasses under some clothes. Brent admitted he did it because it was \u201cfunny\u201d to see \u201cColter acting like a baby\u201d because of his anxious reaction. We asked Brent to apologize but he refused.\n\nMy wife and I decided to ground him for 2 weeks for this, as well as trying to teach him more on autism by asking Colter for some resources. Colleen has been advocating for Brent saying that we are being unfair to him and saying we shouldn\u2019t ground him over \u201ca joke\u201d, Colleen is also much closer to Brent than Kian, like both my wife and I, Colleen and Brent have more \u201cnerdy\u201d interests like comics and science, which make Kian a bit more isolated, but again, we are working on it and always support him in his athletic journey. Colleen is being very insistent on saying we are being too hard on Brent.

Colleen is a dumbass teen (respectfully speaking) and you need to teach your child Brent discipline. Don't raise a bully.", "NTA\n\nI'd say just intentionally breaking anyone's sunglasses is enough to get grounded, but this is even a little worse because not only did he do it on purpose, but he did it specifically to upset Colter.  He was bullying him.  Seems like a reasonable punishment, if you don't punish him at all then he's not going to learn not to do it again.\n\nAlso, your daughter seems nice and everything but I don't think her opinion really factors into the decision here.", "NTA. Brent is destroying property and displaying intolerant and ableist behavior.  If you relent, it's telling him that you find it acceptable.  The purpose of punishment is to prevent a reaccourance.", "NTA - He destroyed his brothers property. It's not a joke.  This is deliberately mean for the sake of it, and it sounds like he is jealous of Kian if I am being 100% honest.  I think you handled this well, especially being so sensitive to Colts' feelings as a child on the spectrum and trying to teach your son more empathy towards such.\n\nIf he had just hid the glasses, it would be different.

Brent deserves some sort of punishment.", "NTA you didn\u2019t ground him over sunglasses, you grounded him for bullying another child.

There was no joke here.", "NTA. I would explain to Colleen that this was more than a joke.", "NTA. \n\nIf it\u2019s done to be hurtful, it\u2019s not a joke.

Joke or not, he could end up really hurting someone one day.\n\nAlso, just based on this post, y'all sound like amazing parents. The fact that you even listen to your kids and consider their input is proof.", "NTA. They\u2019re kids and kids play pranks\u2026but Brent designed the \u201cprank\u201d to target Colter\u2019s autism, using it to get a reaction out of him. That makes it bullying. It\u2019s also destroying what belongs to Kian.\n\nYou\u2019ve responded appropriately and you seem like great parents to take measures to accommodate your children\u2019s friends!", "He didn't hide the glasses: he broke them, and then hid the pieces.\n\nHe could have just hidden the glasses if it was actually a joke, but it was never intended to be.  \n\nI think he broke them, then felt Shame and hid the results of his crime.

What he did was NOT funny and he needs to learn that. It also sounds like your daughter may need to be a little more educated on Colter's disabilities. Causing an autistic person to have a negative reaction on purpose is cruel and the furthest thing from a \"joke\".", "NTA.\n\nI would ground his butt as well. Sister can keep her nosy self out of the situation. I would do some social stories type of work with your son on bullying, and seeing how it goes before moving on. IMO, it is inappropriate to have Colter be the resource & force an interaction. You need to find your own resources.\n\nHowever, all behavior is communication.  If you were to dive deeper into this, I bet dollars to donuts both your daughter & son are annoyed by friends, especially Colter, taking over their house -- their safe space.  That might be why your daughter is backing up Brent, b/c she feels the same way, just had the impulse control to make better decisions.\n\nI would encourage communication & encourage YOU to listen. I suspect they have been saying something about how they don't like other kids over (or specifically Colter), and been shut down and told to suck it up.  It is EASY to cater to the more outgoing child & tell the other kids to suck it up.  \\*I\\* enjoy having  a busy house that is crazy, but 2 out of my 4 kids canNOT deal with the hot mess express a pile of adhd boys can dish. Sometimes? Yes. Everyday? No.", "NTA! \n\nOmg! How absolutely cruel to bait a kid with autism into a fit or tantrum or whatever else words the kid used to do to get a reaction. \n\nFinally.. some parents who dole out proper consequences for actions that the kids do that are not appropriate behaviors in society. Stick to the grounding and the child will THINK next time before treating someone that way.", "NTA. You and your wife sound like good parents. It\u2019s nice to hear a post from a couple who are solidly on the same team.", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't break other people's property period, not just because Colter has austism, brent just should know it's wrong to smash another person's things.\n\nBrent and Colten don't really have to get along, do they? They are not in the same friendship group, I wonder why they don't though? Did something happen between them?", "NTA, and please dont take your 14 yr old daughters as a good source of parenting advice, lol. What Brent did was soo cruel, he clearly has no idea about autism and how hard it is to be overstimulated. I think it's great you're going to force him to learn more about autism, maybe include Colleen on this learning journey as well since she's so keen to defend a non \"joke\".", "NTA. Intentionally breaking something that a person uses to cope isn't \"a joke\" its bullying. Its best to address the issue before it gets worse.", "NTA\n\nThere's no joke present throughout this entire story, there's just an example of bullying. Ask Brent to explain why he thinks it's a joke, then ask Colleen to explain why she thinks it's a joke, then explain to them why it isn't. Course correct with legitimate reasons but be careful with future \"jokes\" as something tells me this isn't a new trend but even if it is put an end to it.", "Nta the sunglassds are irrelevant. He did a cruel thing bc he thought it'd be funny.  Would he steal a deaf persons hearing aid?\n\nYou also need to make it clear to Colleen that she is not involved in this. She is not a parent. She is not even an adult. She needs to butt out.", "NTA. I'd be most concerned about the daughter. The \"joke\" was destroying the tools that a person used to function? If it were destroying someone's wheel chair, that's a difference in degree, not in kind. The younger brother deserves consequences, but he's 11 and a younger sibling; not good but much more understandable than a 14 year old, oldest sibling. I'd ask her to think about whether that was actually funny. If so, she needs some guidance, counseling, or something.", "NTA\n\nBullys always say: \"It's just a joke\"\n\nThank you for raising your child to respect other people.", "So\u2026why are you concerned with a 14 year old child\u2019s opinion on parenting??? YTA for that alone. N T A for grounding the bully. Also, why is your child a bully? That\u2019s a question that needs addressing now before he grows up and stays that way.", "NTA by a long shot. Brent not only purposefully destroyed things that do not belong to him, they were also to help a guest feel more comfortable in your home. This counts as bullying Colter for his autism and ADHD and should not be encouraged or tolerated, as Colleen is doing. Educating Brent on ableism and disabilities with information sourced from Colter sounds like a good plan and maybe you could rope Colleen in too.", "NTA - Your daughter needs to understand that it wasn't \"a joke\" it was abusive bullying.  Deliberately triggering someone's conditions and then making fun of them for it.  And breaking sunglasses.  \n\n\nTwo weeks might not be enough time.  By 11, he should know better.", "NTA\n\nHiding the sunglasses then getting them out and going Surprise! is a joke. Breaking them is malice.", "IMO, Colleen just volunteered herself to have some autism education and awareness sent her way.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right in that there was no \u201cjoke\u201d, this was strictly bullying.\n\nNTA", "It's not just bullying.  It's a hate crime.  He committed a crime (destruction of property) specifically targeted at someone with a disability, because of that disability.", "Not sure why Colleen gets a say in parenting decisions. NTA.", "NTA. \nYour son is realizing that ASD traits can be triggered in this boy by certain situations. That's manipulation and making fun of someone's disorder. \n\n\nBite it in the butt now before he does it to someone he DOESNT know.", "Just offering but the fact you're considering your 14 year old's opinion on the matter and your 11 year old is actively bullying someone for their autism tells me that in general you may have some issues setting appropriate boundaries with your kids. Grounding him and attempting to educate him on autism is about as gentle as parenting gets - it's not unfair in the least. You seem like pushovers.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was no JOKE, this was abuse.", "Ask her to explain the \"joke\" then.\n\nWhen she can't, perhaps include her on the giving resources thing.  NTA.", "Besides the theft where is the sensitivity chip in these 2 kids? Sorry but how is it that Kian knows how to be kind and the other 2 don't?\n This isn't about stealing or lying, this is about a lack of empathy, a sense if coldness, and just plain meanness. That's what needs to be addressed. NTA", "NTA.  Jokes are funny and destroying personal property is not.  When's the last time you saw a comedian break some audience member's stuff?  If breaking people's stuff without their knowledge or consent were funny, one would think people whose actual job is making people laugh would be doing it.", "NTA, but...\n\n>as well as trying to teach him more on autism by asking Colter for some resources.\n\nDon't do this.  It will put Colter on the spot and could be extremely awkward.  It could even set off an anxiety response like Brent was hoping for in the first place.  Have him find them himself, or ask Colter's parents instead.\n\n>we shouldn\u2019t ground him over \u201ca joke\u201d\n\nA joke is something the other person laughs at, too.  A joke is not taking away and breaking something he *needs,* especially in order to make them miserable.  Brent needs to learn the difference between \"a joke\" and \"being cruel for my own entertainment.\"\n\n>My wife and I have talked to his parents on how we can best accommodate him....we always have Kian store a few pairs in his drawer in case Colter forgets.\n\nYou are the *best.*", "NTA, he needs to learn", "NTA, and I\u2019d personally be very concerned by a child confessing that his motivation for purposely destroying someone else\u2019s things (already bad on its own) was essentially because he thinks it\u2019s funny to watch that person suffer without them. I know he\u2019s 11, but that\u2019s a deeply fucked up thing to do.", "NTA but damn bribing an 11 yr old to get into his room? Who is the parent here? Same with the daughter she can be told to get her nose out of business that is not hers.", "I actually went back up to see if Colleen was Colter's mom, but nope."]}
