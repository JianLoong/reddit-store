This was cruel, intentional, and grossly unnecessary.  I would not trust you since you take meticulous notes on people's lives and vomit judgement during gatherings that should be joyful. Fingers crossed your child breaks this cycle.", "Setting boundaries is fine. Blowing up isn\u2019t. \n\nYou\u2019d have been within your right to tell her plainly \u201cstop making these suggestions. I\u2019ve said how we feel. This advice is unwelcome.\u201d\n\nThe personal insults is what makes YTA.", "YTA. You could have easily snapped at her with a \u201cyou\u2019ve said it over and over and my answer is no, stop it\u201d but instead you decided to be sanctimonious, judgmental, and hit below the belt in multiple ways. It was a gross overreaction and shameful.", "YTA \u2026 you are a real piece of work. She might have been a bit annoying but almost certainly meant well. You think that somehow justifies an incredibly personal and nasty attack on her as a mother and human being in front of a bunch of people. You basically called her a failure of a person and a bad mother. About as horrible as you could have been. Lethally venomous overreaction. Super cruel and nasty. Self-reflect.", "YTA. Dang girl you went full psycho. People are annoying sometimes. Family is usually extra annoying. You don\u2019t respond by insulting every facet of someone\u2019s life just for being annoying. I mean clearly you do but that\u2019s what makes you the AH here. May I suggest a pacifier? It may help soothe you in the future.", "YTA. You seem oddly proud of your kid not using a pacifier. Pacifier use is actually recommended to help prevent SIDS.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a fucking pacifier and you made that into an opportunity to get dirty and personal. You went for the jugular over a fucking pacifier. \n\nThe criticisms you made do not reflect on her parenting. They\u2019re personal. Yes, a 5 year old is beyond a pacifier, but guess what: no parent is perfect. You aren\u2019t, and there will be plenty of people who pass judgment on you for your choices too. You haven\u2019t described any behavioral issues, just a pacifier and janky teeth. Your baby doesn\u2019t even have teeth. So what does her employment status, living situation, and finances have to do with either of your parenting choices? Saying that she\u2019s a \u201cprime example of what not to do in raising kids\u201d based solely on socioeconomic factors is classist as fuck. \n\nIt seems like you just don\u2019t like this woman and were looking for an excuse to feel justified in making cruel and unnecessary personal insults. You were horrible to them over tiny comment about a tiny issue. I can\u2019t imagine how nasty you get over actual real shit. YTA.", "YTA. Read the room, my dude. That was an extremely inappropriate response, ESPECIALLY given the context. If you had a problem, you should have addressed it /in private/. Not exploded in front of friends and family. So not cool.", "Well you definitely flew of the handle and we're cruel and rude. I don't know you but most people would have found a less demeaning way to convey their displeasure. So yes, YTA.", "YTA. Don\u2019t send them money if you don\u2019t want too. And guess what, you will get get unsolicited advice from now until forever, you might want to find a less abrasive method of coping. Also my kids teeth are super jacked and he never used a pacifier so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You are a massive AH. You owe your entire family an apology.", "YTA that was over the top and you hit at very personal, hurtful matters when she was just being annoying.", "YTA.\n\nAnd you should probably try a pacifier.", "YTA - her bringing up a pacifier, while annoying, is not a good reason to publicly humiliate her.\n\nYou handled it very poorly, it would have been simple to take her aside and been stern with her in private. Tell her you don't want the advice and basically shut the hell up. No need to do it in such a public manner, in which you attacked her as a person and even laid waste to their son.", "YTA. Are your reactions to annoyances always this disproportionate? There's nothing about what she said that warranted you to choose the nuclear option. Yeah, it was annoying, but you could have handled that a lot better. There was no need to humiliate her like that.", "I\u2019m not sure I believe this story, but if it is true, then yes, YTA, obviously.  You drastically over-reacted and launched into a vicious verbal attack in order to humiliate your SIL in front of the whole family just because she was being slightly annoying.  But if the goal was to drive your brother and his family out of your life, then mission accomplished.", "Yeahhhhhhhh you are going to have to do some serious groveling even if you aren\u2019t sorry. It wasn\u2019t like you said \u201cJFC SUSAN HOW MANY TIMES DID I SAY KNOCK IT OFF ABOUT THE FUCKING PACIFIER?!\u201d Which honestly is probably still a hole, but who hasn\u2019t had a rage eruption from time to time? But no\u2026You went scorched earth and dropped a nuke on her in front of a room full of people. Definitely not ok.\n\nSo if you want a relationship with your brother, you need to at least PRETEND to be sorry. You can always stop giving them money, I can see how it would rub you the wrong way that someone with a 7 and 5 yo doesn\u2019t work at least part time when money is tight.\n\nSo yeah YTA", "Yeah YTA. You were purposely insulting instead of just saying no thank you to the advice. There\u2019s a way to say no without attacking people.", "Major YTA\u2026 how do you talk to someone like that, and wonder if you the AH?!? Dense! You humiliated SIL, brother, and their child. Learn to control your tongue. You didn\u2019t have to say any of what you did to get her to stop..", "YTA, just because you don\u2019t agree with their advice doesn\u2019t mean you tear into them in front of everyone.", "Yta that was harsh! That was way below the belt. You could have told her to stop and you don\u2019t need her advice in a nicer way. you didnt have to throw everything out like that in a room full of people even if it was true. That\u2019s just mean.", "YTA. If you\u2019re so bitter about sending money just stop. It\u2019s fine to be annoyed with her suggestions and draw boundaries on those things. You clearly have bitterness against her so stop helping. Easy.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like there were plenty of opportunities for you to voice your distaste for the suggestion prior to this moment. You allowed this to build up until you were in a super stressful situation and then you blew up at her in front of everyone. And not only did you blow up at her, you went way beyond to the point of being cruel! \n\nShe was offering you a suggestion on how to soothe your child from her perspective, that's all. The very first time that she mentioned it, you should have politely said \"no, thank you, my husband and I have decided that we don't want to use pacifiers\" and listed a few of the reasons why. If she brought it up again, then you could be a little more forceful and explain to her, \"once again, no, and I would appreciate it if you would stop suggesting this\". Instead, you let this go on and on without actually addressing it and then, when you did blow up at her, you dragged her kid into it! You insulted her child, your own niece, in front of the entire family. You insulted your brother and SIL and their finances, and it seems like you wanted to completely humiliate her. Those were some really low blows!\nThen, when it came time to apologize, you nitpicked over the apology and wanted to make it clear that you were only apologizing for the one thing you felt you had to.\n\nHonestly, I'm hoping that the nieces weren't there, but if they were, you definitely owe them a direct apology. You owe your SIL a direct apology. And it honestly sounds like you owe your entire family an apology. It's completely understandable that you were under a very large amount of stress and just trying to get through it, having a finicky baby on top of it makes it even more difficult, and then having someone trying to give you parenting advice when you don't even respect their parenting style, I get where you were coming from and all of this did make sense. However, you already knew that you crossed the line, and then you still made a point to try and keep your higher ground through the apology. That's where you really earned the YTA for me. Instead of just apologizing for the scene that you caused, you still tried to defend yourself, and it sounds like it stems from a belief that you're better than your SIL so your pride didn't want to admit just how wrong you were.\n\nI hope you do apologize and realize just how much you have to apologize for. You didn't just hurt her in this.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Holy shit you need help with your anger issues YTA", "Yta. Especially for the whole basis is she was giving you unsolicited parenting advice, yet admitted you did the same with their kid's pacifier. I mean, you're correct, it jacks up the teeth, but you said that you've told them multiple times about it. Totally hypocritical", "yta\n\nwow.  talk about a disproportionate response.  She made what most people would consider a reasonable suggestion and instead of being reasonable you decided to make it personal at a very low and disgusting level.\n\nYou treated her in a terrible awful way.  Total ahole.", "How\u2019s your twin 37 and you 36?", "ESH because if I had a SIL who insisted on living above their means and expecting me and my retired parents to chip in for it, I'd be annoyed too. But I'd ask for everyone to sit down and talk about it instead of going nuclear on her at an event. Oof.", "Probably unpopular opinion: \n\nESH, but you were the instigator. \n\nI think it\u2019s wrong to comment on how people parent their own children, unless that child is being put in harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s where your SIL was wrong. \n\nBut you could\u2019ve handled yourself better. Instead of snapping at her, you should\u2019ve just kindly asked her not to comment. You blew up on her, extremely unnecessarily, and for that she does deserve an apology. You brought up things that were entirely unrelated just to make her feel inferior so that you could feel like you got back at her somehow, which really didn\u2019t need to be done.", "Wow... you certainly went all in!  I am going with YTA.  You definitely didn't have to do that.  Maybe just pull her and/or your brother aside to ask them nicely to please stop suggesting a pacifier and why.  You slammed her and your brother, who did nothing wrong but come to a celebration for your child.  You obviously have issues about the way they live.  Sounds like you have reasons that are more financial than anything to do with a pacifier.  REALLY harsh to offer to pay to fly them out there, then go off on them for having to pay for them.  Next time don't offer.  As a mom, I get that your nerves were probably raw from stress, hormones, the crying that you couldn't stop, the planning of the Christening, etc. That's a lot. But it's not an excuse to throw your own tantrum.  Sadly, this is what everyone will remember when they think of your child's Christening.  \ud83d\ude15", "Why do you hate pacifiers?", "YTA for belittling your SIL based on their financial situation. \n\nSimply telling her that you will not take her advice regarding a pacifier would have been enough.", "YTA for sure. Was her attitude super annoying? Absolutely! But did it warrant you insulting her, your brother and a little girl in front of everyone? Absolutely not, that was dreadful behaviour on your part. I understand that when a baby cries it\u2019s extremely stressful for the mum - everyone around really - but I\u2019m also worried about the \u2018self-soothing\u2019 you keep referring to. Did you leave the baby to his own devices to sort himself out? If so, I understand why your SIL kept nagging you about the pacifier, even though no should mean no.", "Absolutely OTT inappropriate response to unwanted suggestions by your SIL. There are so many other ways you could have responded without direct personal attacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA and you really need to apologise and work on your communication skills.", "Soooo you can tell her \u201con multiple occasions\u201d that she shouldn\u2019t use a pacifier but when she does the same thing back to you, you lose your shit? I get being frustrated about the financial side of things but screaming at her in front of everyone for something unrelated was REALLY not okay. YTA and you should apologize to her.", "ESH. Your SIL is an AH for not abiding by your boundaries of how you want to raise your child. You\u2019re an AH because you lashed immaturely. \n\nThe way your family is operating is not sustainable if you don\u2019t want to resent each other. Many talks need to be had and boundaries need to be laid down.", "YTA. You are a cruel person and I feel bad for your child who is stuck with you as a mother.", "Wow... you brought a gun to a knife fight, lol. YTA because you went 0-100 when you only should've gone up to about 10, lol. Your SIL was suggesting something that's a common solution. The root of this issue is that you have built resentment and hold a grudge because of the financial assistance you and your parents are giving them. Stop sending money and set boundaries NOW. This will help everyone. Hopefully, it will push her to get a job, your brother to get a better job, and better your relationship with each other. Money and family often lead to very messy and damaged familial relationships.\n\nOh, and apologize and introduce the boundaries within the same conversation. Admit your fault, the reasoning, and work on a solution that will benefit you all.", "Wow. You are cruel and sanctimonious. Like someone else said, you\u2019ve pretty much destroyed your relationship with your SIL. To insult her son\u2019s appearance - his mouth is so jagged? - was low. I\u2019m assuming bro lives with her on her parents\u2019 property too? You managed to insult everyone, didn\u2019t you?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n \nA crying baby is a nuisance and an annoyance to everyone. Considering the fact your baby constantly cries and your southing techniques don\u2019t work, obviously you are seen as a shit parent to everyone else. \n\nMaybe admit that you suck at making your baby quiet and try to find more solutions to make the boy shut up? Cuz as far as this post is concerned, you show yourself as a bad guardian who wants to feel better by insulting others who are \u201cless successful\u201d than you due to their finances.", "YTA. You let the situation reach a point where you just snapped and unloaded on someone. You ought to have taken her aside and told her firmly that when you want advice from her, you will ask for it. Instead you ignored the situation and let it brew to a point where you spoke out not to stop the situation, but to *hurt* someone on a profound level.\n\nAre pacifiers really that bad? Or are you going off of just one person who says they're bad? It sounds like you're also making this a hill to die on, and it's a really stupid one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You seem like a very nasty person.", "How long was OP holding all those mean things in for? YTA", "I can\u2019t believe you have to write that down and still ask all of us to know if you were a AH. \n\nI mean the self realisation must have come during the speech.", "YTA\n\nLike if she were insulting you and telling you that you sucked at parenting, sure. But she was just giving some unsolicited advice you didn't agree with.\n\nIt sounds like you were waiting for a reason to lash out and you tried to use this. I guarantee anyone around who heard this will regard you as less than her, no matter what her financial or job situation is. No matter how long her kid uses a pacifier. You will be the asshole forever unless you go to great lengths to mend this.", "YTA better ways to handle this. You could have tried her suggestion. Pacifiers are helpful. As long as they aren't abused and taken away properly at at the right time there is no harm. She is one extreme and you are the other. \n\nYou admit in your comments you were in the wrong and still asking you should apologize. Yes, you should apologize being stressed is not an excuse to go nuclear on her and attack her for giving you a suggestion you could have tried.  \n\nGet off your high horse on your parenting. Like it ain't the end of the world if you take some advice from other parents. This could have been good advice.", "INFO: what do you mean by self soothing? What are your techniques?", "Went from 0 to 100 real quick", "YTA! Big time A!", "YTA. You were unnecessarily rude. Should your SIL be shut down? Yes. Should you have gone nuclear on her? No. Your reaction was way too over the top.", "YTA\n\n\u201cNaturally my friends are on my side.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re probably too afraid to say anything that might unleash your fury at them!\n\nYour other comments indicate that there are much larger issues going on. There\u2019s a lot of animosity towards your SIL. Some of it is your own doing. Stop sending them money if you don\u2019t approve of how it\u2019s spent. It\u2019s not your place to judge anyone for staying at home with their children. \n\nYou owe her an apology for your behavior. Between you and your spouse, figure out what you want to do about money sent to your SIL because it\u2019s causing resentment, anger, and hostility.", "Damn. OP just eviscerated her SIL here. Did you dive into the deep end of the asshole pool when you described her five year old\u2019s teeth as \u201cjagged and ruined?\u201d Let\u2019s be honest, yeah. And then when you got out of the pool, did you decide to climb onto the high dive, so you could go jump back into the asshole pool to say, \u201cShe and my brother will probably have to ask me and my husband for money for orthodontics care because they can\u2019t afford it?\u201d Yes indeed. AITA because I read that and thought, \u201cHoly shit\u2026.SIL should have stopped yapping about the pacifier days ago?\u201d and then started laughing my ass off? Most def. ESH, including me for laughing, but for real, SIL brought a knife to a gun fight here.", "YTA\n\nI get that the continued unsolicited advice would of gotten to you but your response went too far.  Depending on what's happening, lack of sleep stress and whatever I total understand wanting to go off especially when someone keeps going on and on but one has to restrain themselves.\n\nClearly if she wasn't listening to your response that you will not be taking on her advice, you should of went to your twin and speak with them instead.", "Yikes. YTA.", "Omfg thank you for the laugh. Oh man she sounds like a mess. Stop funding her. NTA.", "I have a masters degree in a field only 3% of human population can understand. Self soothing is abuse. YTA.", "YTA, obviously. Maybe you should have said something to them about your niece before she was five years old with a fucked up jaw and teeth, if you're such an expert on parenting. But you didn't. You just chose to wait to be an absolute AH to your SIL in front of everyone, accomplishing nothing productive.", "YTA, you showed your entire ass...at a christening no less! No hate quite like christian love, amiright?\nAnd what do YOU do for a living?", "Annoying uninvited advices are not at the same level as the personal insults you gave to your SIL. Massive YTA.", "It\u2019s not. I\u2019m annoyed she doesn\u2019t get a job and help my brother contribute to the household. It\u2019s unfair for my retired parents, and me on occasion to have to send them money when she refuses to work and then gives me parenting suggestions. Yeah. No.", "I know - I was just so stressed with the christening and her comments were just so annoying and constant. I snapped and I did go nuclear. I feel a bit bad for embarrassing her and myself.", "OP is deeply insecure about her own abilities as a mother and lashed out in about the most mean spirited way possible. Don't have kids if you can't handle the pressure. It doesn't get easier.\n\nHer initial comments about paying for their flights are telling. There is resenment there. She has enough self awareness to know she messed up with what she said in front of the family but I am sure she feels absolutely no remorse (beyond how it affects her) because she had this in her pocket ready to go. \n\nHope her family realize what a monster she truly is and goes no contact with her. I feel really sorry for that kid, having her as it's mother.", "Yeah, right? Like hopefully that nastiness doesn\u2019t spill over to her poor kid.", "Letting your 5 year old utilize a pacifier is not about \"not being a perfect parent\", its about making choices detrimental to your child's health. It is a horrible decision that will forever harm their daughter.", "\ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23", "I was wondering this, too. I was thinking Irish twins, possibly?", "Typo\u2026 I\u2019m on my phone. We actually turn 37 on Friday.", "ESH. You shouldnt go nuclear on her and she shouldnt push her unsolicited advice on you.", "Yeah, if you know what it\u2019s like to watch one sibling siphon money from parents etc etc then you understand why she did what she did.\n\nHonestly I almost don\u2019t think she\u2019s TA at all. Imagine flying your brothers whole family to your party, and his wife gives you shit the whole time in private and in front of everyone.", "SIL didn't comment on how OP parents her child. She gave her a suggestion that could help OP and her child.", "No shot lol the content would be an easy YTA any time. It\u2019s one thing to say the advice is unwelcome and set firm but fair boundaries; it\u2019s another thing to just lay into someone.", "But SIL never went low? Never insulted op or anything\u2026 \n\nOp has anger issues that needs to dealt with, I question if that baby is safe around her at the moment\u2026 definitely a question that needs to be asked.", "(This is called being an asshole to an asshole)", "And what about OP\u2019s unsolicited advice about pacifiers? You know, where she said she had told SIL \u2018multiple\u2019 times about pacifiers?", "So in other words, you just don't like her.\n\nThere are many stay at home parents (who contribute in other ways than monetarily) and parents that are in poverty... that doesn't make them bad parents. \n\nYTA majorly.", "Whether she works is not your business. That is between her and her husband. Whether your parents give her money is not, your business. That is their choice. The only thing you have control over is whether you give her money. If you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to be so nasty and cruel.", "YTA, it seems you see yourself as higher status than your lowly brother and his wife. Do you have a job yourself, or do you just fuck a doctor for money? Do you work full time and have a nanny raise your kids? Hey, I don\u2019t know you and shouldn\u2019t make assumptions but you need to come off your high horse. That may be ignorant about pacifiers and money, but you seem ugly inside.", "OP, maybe your brother is okay with her not working? Sometimes we think it\u2019s one partner being lazy, but we don\u2019t know the behind-the-scenes situation. Your parents seem to be okay with it because sometimes\nOlder people just want to be needed. Don\u2019t be mad at her. Be mad at her enablers\u2026your family!!!!", "Is your younger niece neurotypical? Because a lot of the things you\u2019ve said about how they treat her would make a lot more sense if she isn\u2019t NT.", "So you recognize that you were wrong but are still asking everyone to say it's ok not to apologize??", "Just a bit?\n\nI just reread what you said to her, and man... holy fuck, I can't believe you said all that... that was so out-of-bounds in every way... I don't know what you can do to ever repair that relationship... an apology isn't going to fix this... if I was her, I'd never speak to you again, and frankly, wish you dead...\n\nI wanna see your side here, but gees...", "Why don\u2019t you just give your kid a freaking pacifier? There\u2019s nothing wrong with using them at his age.", "If you don\u2019t get that a constantly crying baby (especially not your own baby) is stressful and annoying are you even a human? \n\nPerhaps your SIL has misophonia other auditory issues and is doing her best? If so, simply suggesting a pacifier is incredible control on her part.", "Her kid is going to 100% bully their cousins when older and do the \"MY mum said (insert perceived failure here)\"", "Perhaps, leaving that aside why do you love AITA subreddit so much? \n\nMe personally, I like seeing people fight each other in the comment section lmao", "Well, happy birthday to you & your twin in advance \ud83c\udf82", "The SIL wasn't giving shit she kept suggesting something that could have been helpful but OP too busy being on her high horse to take that advice into consideration.", "The thing about OP's post is she makes it seem like it's about the pacifier but it's definitely not about that lol. I can imagine asking for some support to make ends meet but SIL insisting on sending her kids to private school when she's contributing zero dollars is wild to me.", "What about it? OP made them aware about their stance on pacifiers and that they\u2019re against them and why they are against them. Why would SIL keep pushing for them to use something they\u2019ve clearly stated they\u2019ve no interest in using?", "I do like her. I don\u2019t like her expensive taste like Montessori and private school that she and my brother can\u2019t afford but she insists on and we have to fund it. My parents, hers, etc.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about poverty- it\u2019s about being too lazy to contribute to wanting things for your kids that you can\u2019t afford and not working and expecting money to be given to you when you ask.", "Oh what I wish to be able to just give a kid a pacifier. Some babies refuse any paci you give them, it isn\u2019t as easy as giving them it. My extremely picky baby refused hundreds of dollars of bottles/pacifiers/sippy cups trying to find a good one. Not defending OP.", "My baby self weaned from the pacifier in her 7th week of life. Absolutely refused to use any of them after that. Many babies don\u2019t use them, and not every baby finds them soothing.", "Repeatedly making the same suggestion and critiquing her during the party she is hosting?? Umm kurrr", "Then I think the solution is to not give her money because resenting her for asking and you giving doesn't seem like it is healthy for you.", "No one is making you fund anything. Be an adult and POLITELY say no next time.", "I\u2019d hate to hear how you talk about someone you don\u2019t like then.", "Stop funding their lifestyle. It makes you the problem for enabling the behavior. \n\nI don't give my kids pacifiers either and i raised 4. I believe they get addicted and it's hard to get them off. And it can be detrimental to the teeth. But you definitely went too far because you have been enabling her behavior as well.", "If this is how you treat someone you like I\u2019d hate to see how you treat someone you don\u2019t like!", "So your angry on behalf of your brother, your parents and her parents. Have you actually talked to all of these individuals? Have you talked with your brother? Or you've decided to just be angry on behalf of everyone? How about you stop giving your occasional support and let the other choose for themselves...", "You don\u2019t HAVE to do anything. You choose to fund it. \n\nThen you throw it in their face. \n\nGifts are gifts and should be given without expectations. \n\nIf you want to stop gifting them, give them a months notice. \n\nYTA- HUGEEEEEE.", "What do you do for a living?", "Mate! WHATEVER your issues are with her, this was not the way to voice them. Please apologise, unconditionally and be prepared to still not be forgiven. \n\nThat\u2019s just\u2026.nuclear is an understatement.", "Stop giving them money. You funding their lifestyle is only going to get worse.", "She said she\u2019s never tried it, though. Seems like she has some philosophical objection to it.", "My daughter took a pacifier immediately. We eventually took it from her. A rough night, but only one. \n\nOur boys were take it or leave it with pacifiers, right from birth. but in this type of circumstance it would have settled them.", "Yeah and as a parent of another kid who did love the paci, I\u2019m glad my second hates them. They were hell to wean off of, and messed up her teeth for the short time she did have them. They\u2019re good for calming a baby down but they\u2019re not some parenting must-have or you\u2019re negligent. \n\nThe baby isn\u2019t crying for something he\u2019s never had, he\u2019s crying for some other reason that a pacifier would just mask.", "She does, she thinks it messes up their teeth and makes them dependent on something external to calm themselves. I don't have kids but it does make sense.", "I didn\u2019t say it was negligent, just stupid to stubbornly refuse to try something that\u2019s quite likely to work."]}
