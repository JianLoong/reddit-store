My twin and his wife (41f) flew in for the christening with my nieces (7,5 f). They live in another state and I paid for their flights because they live with a modest income and she is a stay at home mom.\n\nThe day before the christening, when they arrived, my son was crying and we tried his usual self-soothing techniques but he wouldn\u2019t stop. My SIL said, we should just give him his pacifier. I told her we don\u2019t use pacifiers and he\u2019s never tried one.\n\nOver the next few days, it was a similar rodeo. Baby cry and we would use self-soothing techniques and SIL would mention how pacifiers would soothe him. Well, after the christening, upon her suggestion once again to give my crying son a pacifier, I snapped and in a room full of friends and family, I said, I would never take parenting advice from a 41 year old woman that still lives with on her parent\u2019s property, cannot hold down a job so she\u2019s a \u201cstay at home mom\u201d, that my retired parents have to send money every month to help them make ends meet and who\u2019s 5 year old still uses a pacifier to soothe herself and proudly shows them off. A 5 year old whose mouth is so jagged and ruined that she and my brother will probably have to ask me and my husband for money for orthodontics care because they can\u2019t afford it.  She\u2019s a prime example of what not to do in raising kids.\n\nWell - obviously the room was silent and she ran off crying and she and my brother left. They only came back that evening but she nor my brother said anything to me. They left the next day to the airport. \n\nMy brother said I have to apologize and it was unfair of me to throw their finances in their faces. While I apologized for that, I said I would not apologize for telling her the fact about my nieces situation and I told him that on multiple occasions both I and my husband (he\u2019s a pediatrician) have warned them about the negative effects of a pacifier on a child. My brother told me to mind my own business and I said I gladly would as long as his wife minded hers. \n\nNow my parents are telling me to apologize again. Naturally my friends are on my side. So internet, AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\n1. To those saying I\u2019m a bad parent because my son is constantly crying. He\u2019s teething and we have various self soothing techniques we use including self soothing music, his Sophie (classic teething toy), his soothing support stuffie, etc.\n\n2. Brother and SIL asked husband and I (pediatrician and surgeon) for medical advice regarding 5 year old niece still using pacifiers. We warned them on multiple occasions about the negative effects of pacifiers on kids her age. They just failed to implement medical advice.\n\n3. I do not have a temper, I was very stressed. However I will be reaching out to SIL in a few days to speak with her directly and apologize for my hurtful outburst.\n\n4. The comments about the finances, yes, I am upset because my brother is upset about their finances and wants her to get a job to help burden the load (his words). He\u2019s in grad school after a layoff to get a better opportunity for his family. He wishes she would help.

You could have easily snapped at her with a \u201cyou\u2019ve said it over and over and my answer is no, stop it\u201d but instead you decided to be sanctimonious, judgmental, and hit below the belt in multiple ways. It was a gross overreaction and shameful.", "YTA \u2026 you are a real piece of work. She might have been a bit annoying but almost certainly meant well. You think that somehow justifies an incredibly personal and nasty attack on her as a mother and human being in front of a bunch of people. You basically called her a failure of a person and a bad mother. About as horrible as you could have been. Lethally venomous overreaction. Super cruel and nasty. Self-reflect.", "YTA. Dang girl you went full psycho. People are annoying sometimes. Family is usually extra annoying. You don\u2019t respond by insulting every facet of someone\u2019s life just for being annoying. I mean clearly you do but that\u2019s what makes you the AH here. May I suggest a pacifier? It may help soothe you in the future.", "YTA. You seem oddly proud of your kid not using a pacifier. Pacifier use is actually recommended to help prevent SIDS. Your husband the pediatrician should know that.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a fucking pacifier and you made that into an opportunity to get dirty and personal. You went for the jugular over a fucking pacifier. \n\nThe criticisms you made do not reflect on her parenting. They\u2019re personal. Yes, a 5 year old is beyond a pacifier, but guess what: no parent is perfect. You aren\u2019t, and there will be plenty of people who pass judgment on you for your choices too. You haven\u2019t described any behavioral issues, just a pacifier and janky teeth. Your baby doesn\u2019t even have teeth. So what does her employment status, living situation, and finances have to do with either of your parenting choices? Saying that she\u2019s a \u201cprime example of what not to do in raising kids\u201d based solely on socioeconomic factors is classist as fuck. \n\nIt seems like you just don\u2019t like this woman and were looking for an excuse to feel justified in making cruel and unnecessary personal insults.

That was an extremely inappropriate response, ESPECIALLY given the context. If you had a problem, you should have addressed it /in private/. Not exploded in front of friends and family. So not cool.", "Well you definitely flew of the handle and we're cruel and rude. I don't know you but most people would have found a less demeaning way to convey their displeasure. So yes, YTA.", "YTA. Don\u2019t send them money if you don\u2019t want too. And guess what, you will get get unsolicited advice from now until forever, you might want to find a less abrasive method of coping.

You owe your entire family an apology.", "YTA that was over the top and you hit at very personal, hurtful matters when she was just being annoying.", "YTA.\n\nAnd you should probably try a pacifier.", "YTA - her bringing up a pacifier, while annoying, is not a good reason to publicly humiliate her.\n\nYou handled it very poorly, it would have been simple to take her aside and been stern with her in private. Tell her you don't want the advice and basically shut the hell up. No need to do it in such a public manner, in which you attacked her as a person and even laid waste to their son.", "YTA. Are your reactions to annoyances always this disproportionate? There's nothing about what she said that warranted you to choose the nuclear option. Yeah, it was annoying, but you could have handled that a lot better. There was no need to humiliate her like that.", "I\u2019m not sure I believe this story, but if it is true, then yes, YTA, obviously.  You drastically over-reacted and launched into a vicious verbal attack in order to humiliate your SIL in front of the whole family just because she was being slightly annoying.  But if the goal was to drive your brother and his family out of your life, then mission accomplished.", "Yeahhhhhhhh you are going to have to do some serious groveling even if you aren\u2019t sorry. It wasn\u2019t like you said \u201cJFC SUSAN HOW MANY TIMES DID I SAY KNOCK IT OFF ABOUT THE FUCKING PACIFIER?!\u201d Which honestly is probably still a hole, but who hasn\u2019t had a rage eruption from time to time? But no\u2026You went scorched earth and dropped a nuke on her in front of a room full of people. Definitely not ok.\n\nSo if you want a relationship with your brother, you need to at least PRETEND to be sorry. You can always stop giving them money, I can see how it would rub you the wrong way that someone with a 7 and 5 yo doesn\u2019t work at least part time when money is tight.\n\nSo yeah YTA", "Yeah YTA. You were purposely insulting instead of just saying no thank you to the advice. There\u2019s a way to say no without attacking people.", "Major YTA\u2026 how do you talk to someone like that, and wonder if you the AH?!? Dense! You humiliated SIL, brother, and their child. Learn to control your tongue. You didn\u2019t have to say any of what you did to get her to stop..", "YTA, just because you don\u2019t agree with their advice doesn\u2019t mean you tear into them in front of everyone.", "Yta that was harsh! That was way below the belt. You could have told her to stop and you don\u2019t need her advice in a nicer way. you didnt have to throw everything out like that in a room full of people even if it was true. That\u2019s just mean.", "YTA. If you\u2019re so bitter about sending money just stop. It\u2019s fine to be annoyed with her suggestions and draw boundaries on those things. You clearly have bitterness against her so stop helping. Easy.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like there were plenty of opportunities for you to voice your distaste for the suggestion prior to this moment. You allowed this to build up until you were in a super stressful situation and then you blew up at her in front of everyone. And not only did you blow up at her, you went way beyond to the point of being cruel! \n\nShe was offering you a suggestion on how to soothe your child from her perspective, that's all. The very first time that she mentioned it, you should have politely said \"no, thank you, my husband and I have decided that we don't want to use pacifiers\" and listed a few of the reasons why. If she brought it up again, then you could be a little more forceful and explain to her, \"once again, no, and I would appreciate it if you would stop suggesting this\". Instead, you let this go on and on without actually addressing it and then, when you did blow up at her, you dragged her kid into it! You insulted her child, your own niece, in front of the entire family. You insulted your brother and SIL and their finances, and it seems like you wanted to completely humiliate her. Those were some really low blows!\nThen, when it came time to apologize, you nitpicked over the apology and wanted to make it clear that you were only apologizing for the one thing you felt you had to.\n\nHonestly, I'm hoping that the nieces weren't there, but if they were, you definitely owe them a direct apology. You owe your SIL a direct apology. And it honestly sounds like you owe your entire family an apology. It's completely understandable that you were under a very large amount of stress and just trying to get through it, having a finicky baby on top of it makes it even more difficult, and then having someone trying to give you parenting advice when you don't even respect their parenting style, I get where you were coming from and all of this did make sense. However, you already knew that you crossed the line, and then you still made a point to try and keep your higher ground through the apology. That's where you really earned the YTA for me. Instead of just apologizing for the scene that you caused, you still tried to defend yourself, and it sounds like it stems from a belief that you're better than your SIL so your pride didn't want to admit just how wrong you were.\n\nI hope you do apologize and realize just how much you have to apologize for. You didn't just hurt her in this.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Holy shit you need help with your anger issues YTA", "Yta. Especially for the whole basis is she was giving you unsolicited parenting advice, yet admitted you did the same with their kid's pacifier. I mean, you're correct, it jacks up the teeth, but you said that you've told them multiple times about it. Totally hypocritical", "yta\n\nwow.  talk about a disproportionate response.  She made what most people would consider a reasonable suggestion and instead of being reasonable you decided to make it personal at a very low and disgusting level.\n\nYou treated her in a terrible awful way.  Total ahole.", "How\u2019s your twin 37 and you 36?", "ESH because if I had a SIL who insisted on living above their means and expecting me and my retired parents to chip in for it, I'd be annoyed too. But I'd ask for everyone to sit down and talk about it instead of going nuclear on her at an event. Oof.", "Probably unpopular opinion: \n\nESH, but you were the instigator. \n\nI think it\u2019s wrong to comment on how people parent their own children, unless that child is being put in harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s where your SIL was wrong. \n\nBut you could\u2019ve handled yourself better. Instead of snapping at her, you should\u2019ve just kindly asked her not to comment. You blew up on her, extremely unnecessarily, and for that she does deserve an apology. You brought up things that were entirely unrelated just to make her feel inferior so that you could feel like you got back at her somehow, which really didn\u2019t need to be done.", "Wow... you certainly went all in!  I am going with YTA.  You definitely didn't have to do that.  Maybe just pull her and/or your brother aside to ask them nicely to please stop suggesting a pacifier and why.  You slammed her and your brother, who did nothing wrong but come to a celebration for your child.  You obviously have issues about the way they live.  Sounds like you have reasons that are more financial than anything to do with a pacifier.  REALLY harsh to offer to pay to fly them out there, then go off on them for having to pay for them.  Next time don't offer.  As a mom, I get that your nerves were probably raw from stress, hormones, the crying that you couldn't stop, the planning of the Christening, etc. That's a lot. But it's not an excuse to throw your own tantrum.  Sadly, this is what everyone will remember when they think of your child's Christening.  \ud83d\ude15", "Why do you hate pacifiers?", "YTA for belittling your SIL based on their financial situation. \n\nSimply telling her that you will not take her advice regarding a pacifier would have been enough.", "YTA for sure. Was her attitude super annoying? Absolutely! But did it warrant you insulting her, your brother and a little girl in front of everyone? Absolutely not, that was dreadful behaviour on your part. I understand that when a baby cries it\u2019s extremely stressful for the mum - everyone around really - but I\u2019m also worried about the \u2018self-soothing\u2019 you keep referring to. Did you leave the baby to his own devices to sort himself out? If so, I understand why your SIL kept nagging you about the pacifier, even though no should mean no.", "Absolutely OTT inappropriate response to unwanted suggestions by your SIL. There are so many other ways you could have responded without direct personal attacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA and you really need to apologise and work on your communication skills.", "Soooo you can tell her \u201con multiple occasions\u201d that she shouldn\u2019t use a pacifier but when she does the same thing back to you, you lose your shit? I get being frustrated about the financial side of things but screaming at her in front of everyone for something unrelated was REALLY not okay. YTA and you should apologize to her.", "ESH. Your SIL is an AH for not abiding by your boundaries of how you want to raise your child. You\u2019re an AH because you lashed immaturely. \n\nThe way your family is operating is not sustainable if you don\u2019t want to resent each other. Many talks need to be had and boundaries need to be laid down.", "[removed]", "Wow... you brought a gun to a knife fight, lol. YTA because you went 0-100 when you only should've gone up to about 10, lol. Your SIL was suggesting something that's a common solution. The root of this issue is that you have built resentment and hold a grudge because of the financial assistance you and your parents are giving them. Stop sending money and set boundaries NOW. This will help everyone. Hopefully, it will push her to get a job, your brother to get a better job, and better your relationship with each other. Money and family often lead to very messy and damaged familial relationships.\n\nOh, and apologize and introduce the boundaries within the same conversation. Admit your fault, the reasoning, and work on a solution that will benefit you all.", "Wow. You are cruel and sanctimonious. Like someone else said, you\u2019ve pretty much destroyed your relationship with your SIL. To insult her son\u2019s appearance - his mouth is so jagged? - was low.

Considering the fact your baby constantly cries and your southing techniques don\u2019t work, obviously you are seen as a shit parent to everyone else. \n\nMaybe admit that you suck at making your baby quiet and try to find more solutions to make the boy shut up? Cuz as far as this post is concerned, you show yourself as a bad guardian who wants to feel better by insulting others who are \u201cless successful\u201d than you due to their finances.", "YTA. You let the situation reach a point where you just snapped and unloaded on someone. You ought to have taken her aside and told her firmly that when you want advice from her, you will ask for it. Instead you ignored the situation and let it brew to a point where you spoke out not to stop the situation, but to *hurt* someone on a profound level.\n\nAre pacifiers really that bad?

What you are literally doing with the self soothing shit, is to shut down the natural signs of babies communicating their needs. Babies need to be responded when thry cry, by fulfilling their needs. Babies soothing method is care and touching, and their mouth / sucktion teflex. Not responding to baby's cry, it will eventually stop crying but not because they learn to soothe themselves, but because they learn their needs won't be responded. \n\nThis literally changes their brain physically and will affect their emotional developement for a life. This branch of science and development psychology started back at 90's in Romanian orphanages when a scientist found out that childrens brains change irreversably when their needs aren't met, not held, touched etc. \n\nWhat all those self soothing methods are doin is this. Yes it will stop the crying eventually, but it is also causing permanent damage to a baby's brain. Feel free to read some neuroscience to check this thing out.\n\nAlso, when teething, baby is in pain. They need something to ease the pain, something to chew and suck to ease their gums.\n\nEdit: If your husband really is a pediatrician, he should know this.

Thanks for coming out here for us.\" I would bet money that the SIL would be more responsive to something like this than Aunt Edna.\n\nOP said she brought up why her SIL *shouldn't* use pacifiers multiple times, evidently before OP even had kids looking at the age difference. It sounds like OP was bringing the same exact thing up without being asked, so perhaps SIL felt justified to dish it back the same way. Especially seeing a pacifier might actually help her 10 month old in that situation. There are ways to wean kids off the things. Regardless, there are certainly better ways to handle this than knowingly letting it fester until you \"go ballistic\", and this was clearly over much more than just the pacifier topic.", "She also doesn't say how long her child has been crying, and at what decibel.    Who expects a very young infant to \"self sooth\"?    \n\nThe SIL, as a parent, probably can't stand to see any suffer, and was legitimately offering advice.  Seeing a baby suffer, hearing it scream, is enough to make anyone \"lose her head\".

She could have ignored the SIL, removed  the baby to another room, said any of the polite responses written above...

A crying baby makes everyone tense and driven to get it to stop crying, and especially the mother, it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s be a bit snappy.

It\u2019s her kid and she\u2019s raising him how she sees fit. She didn\u2019t ask for advice and told her SIL that the pacifier wasn\u2019t an option.
