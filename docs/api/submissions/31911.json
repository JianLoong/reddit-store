During my pregnancy, my SO didn\u2019t give me the support and caring that I needed, I felt very alone also because my parents are in a different country even though we talk often. During postpartum, I had close to zero help and emotional support from my SO and ended up moving out because the disrespect and the lack of consideration were too much.\n\nAt some point, we agreed we would spend Xmas eve with my parents and Xmas day with his parents and family because my parents were coming this year. \n\nMe and my baby of 3 months recently came to spend some time with my parents because we live in different countries. During this time, the kitchen at my parents apartment burned down and caused a lot of damage to the apartment and belongings because there was a crazy amount of smoke. The fire started during the night so we were all asleep.. we had to go to the hospital, etc\u2026\n\nBecause of this recent event, my parents decided they\u2019ll probably not be able to come because they\u2019re emotionally fragile and exhausted which I understand so I told my SO that in this case I would like to stay home for Xmas eve just between ourselves (me, baby, him and his other child), because I feel like having a quiet night, in my own space where I can comfortably breastfeed and put my baby to sleep (sometimes he has fussy nights and needs me to stay with him all night long). \n\nSo basically the location for Xmas eve is different, but we\u2019re still spending the 25 with his family but he reacted very harshly, said I\u2019m a POS, that I\u2019m acting as if my family was more important than his  and that if this is what we\u2019ll do, next year I won\u2019t have a say on where we spend 24 or 25. \n\nSorry for the long post.

Calling you a POS for what you are describing is a red flag. Are you aware that abusive behavior from a partner also escalates during /after pregnancy?\n\nI'd ask you to consider one thing: do you want your child to grow up witnessing this behaviour and thinking that this is normal in a relationship? If not, get out, or go to counselling so that you can work out what is best for you. Do not go to couples counselling, it doesn't work in abusive relationships and can make things worse as the abuser learns new ways to abuse you.", "The bigger issue here is your SO. If he were giving you the proper kind of support, it wouldn't matter much where you spent Christmas. Christmas is only 2-3 days a year, SO is every day. You do the math.
