If he ends up borrowing money from someone else, it's his responsibility to re-pay it not you. He has literally done nothing for you including providing the bare minimum expected of a parent. It doesn't matter if your plate is full or you have a chest full of golden coins; you owe him nothing. Does he bring any value to your life? If not, who cares if he never talks to you again.", "NTA. It\u2019s not on you to support his dependents, especially if it means you can\u2019t meet your own basic costs like food and bills. \n\nHe\u2019s already kicked you out of the house for talking to your *other parent*, and now this; it sounds like he\u2019s a narcissist.

And since you\u2019ve refused, he\u2019s back to being absent? Find a family of your choosing, this father is no dad.", "NTA. Your ability to eat and get to work takes precedence over your sister celebrating graduation.

If he\u2019s so willing to throw out a relationship with you than that\u2019s on him. you are not in any way at fault", "NTA. \n\nClearly, the last time he\u2019ll call you\u2026 until he needs more money.", "NTA and the father isn't a parent to you at all. A real parent wouldn't have and their child for a hand out, and if they did, wouldn't emotionally manipulate and threaten to get what they want.\n\nI'm sorry your dad sucks. I do hope you write your sister a nice note or something for her grad, though.", "NTA. Your dad is cutting you off and going NC because you don\u2019t have money *in your pocket* to donate to his other daughter\u2019s grad party?  You are never an AH in this scenario.", "NTA.\n\nHe contacts you only when he wants money.\n\nDon't take a call from him again. Stand up for yourself.

It sounds like he was a deadbeat dad, tell him to take it out of the unpaid childsupport he owes you", "NTA.  Your father is way out of line.  If you say you can't, he should respect that.  If he's keeping count, he's an AH.", "Currently, no. I have been living alone until recently (cohabitating with my partner). I graduated through scholarship and part-time jobs.

What a hard life you have had and are having.\n\nNTA\n\nWell done for standing up for yourself.\n\nPlease do not lose any more sleep or spend any more time worrying about what this AH of a father said to you.
