If he ends up borrowing money from someone else, it's his responsibility to re-pay it not you. He has literally done nothing for you including providing the bare minimum expected of a parent. It doesn't matter if your plate is full or you have a chest full of golden coins; you owe him nothing. Does he bring any value to your life? If not, who cares if he never talks to you again.", "NTA. It\u2019s not on you to support his dependents, especially if it means you can\u2019t meet your own basic costs like food and bills. \n\nHe\u2019s already kicked you out of the house for talking to your *other parent*, and now this; it sounds like he\u2019s a narcissist.

And since you\u2019ve refused, he\u2019s back to being absent? Find a family of your choosing, this father is no dad.", "NTA.

A real parent wouldn't have and their child for a hand out, and if they did, wouldn't emotionally manipulate and threaten to get what they want.\n\nI'm sorry your dad sucks. I do hope you write your sister a nice note or something for her grad, though.", "NTA. Your dad is cutting you off and going NC because you don\u2019t have money *in your pocket* to donate to his other daughter\u2019s grad party?  You are never an AH in this scenario.", "NTA.\n\nHe contacts you only when he wants money.\n\nDon't take a call from him again. Stand up for yourself.

It sounds like he was a deadbeat dad, tell him to take it out of the unpaid childsupport he owes you", "NTA.  Your father is way out of line.  If you say you can't, he should respect that.  If he's keeping count, he's an AH.", "Currently, no. I have been living alone until recently (cohabitating with my partner). I graduated through scholarship and part-time jobs. Grew-up in my teachers' homes and college dormitory until I landed a job and was able to rent an apartment. \n\nI got CoVID/dengue (actually still paying hospital bills) and almost died alone if not for my cats who wake me up to eat and drink hahaha", "What rattled me was when he told me this was the third time I declined him. I never knew he was keeping tabs. Should have told him I declined a lawyer's offer for help on child support when I was in 4th grade because I did not want my half-sisters to get less just so I could have it.", "Yup, he disappeared with my stepmom and this graduating babysis when I was a toddler. We eventually lost all of our fortune after that due to my mom having chronic depression (also became more abusive (Castillian house so normal for us to be hurt or \"palo\")). \n\nThe problem with me is I am also trying to rebuild all we have lost mag-isa (my older siblings were not able to go to college, one got a job as a prostitute and now becoming an absentee parent with her children) so basically I'm catching all the leaks.", "Thank you for this. I love my sister and I hope she'll be able to understand.", "NTA- You have your responsibilities and you are an adult prioritizing your own responsibilities.\n\nYour father hasn't acted like a father so I'm not sure why he is expecting you to sacrifice for him when he has never sacrificed for you.", "Hi so sorry for all your suffering. What a hard life you have had and are having.\n\nNTA\n\nWell done for standing up for yourself.\n\nPlease do not lose any more sleep or spend any more time worrying about what this AH of a father said to you. He is not worthy to be your father. You have turned out so well in spite of him.\n\nGood luck and every blessing.", "NTA he won't talk to you because you won't give him money despite you needing it. Do not give anything at the end of the month, save and plan for your future.

This is not your child's grad.  It is his. Not your responsibility.  It is his.  Don't let this jerk guilt you into paying.  NOT YOUR JOB!!", "NTA You're too kind and it's ruining YOUR life. Stop talking to your father. Stop giving extended family money. Do this for 3 months and see how well you feel. Adk yourself if your father would EVER help you.", "NTA", "Let me get this straight.\n\nYou were raised by your mom (and possibly set parent?) until you were 17 or so.\n\nYou lived with your dad for 6 months or so until he kicked you ourt for talking to the parent that raised yo.\n\nNow, he wants money from you.\n\nWhy would you even give the person any money?    You sound like you are living pay check to pay check and have very little savings.\n\nNTA, and maybe it is OK if your father goes NC with you.", "YTA for calling that man ypur father. He is your sperm donor. You owe him absolutely nothing.  And you dont owe anyone that he has spawned any money. Especially if you need that money to support yourself.\n\nYou need to put your focus on you and stop supporting everyone else around you.", "I\u2019m so sorry, OP. Sounds like he sees you as a resource and not a loved family member. That\u2019s on him, not you.", " NTA. You shouldn\u2019t nor need a relationship with him.

If so, your dad has an incredibly messed up idea of what\u2019s important", "Vote back pls", "NTA\n\nhe kicked you out because you talked to your mom \n\ndon't do any favours for this guy, he isn't worth it", "NTA He's just using you. His response was so extreme because he wants scare you into giving in.  You have more important priorities than his kid's party or whatever a grad encompasses. He won't really cut off all communication because he'll want to ask you for money another time.", "NTA\n\nStand firm. I guarantee that the only reason he wanted contact with you was to use you.\n\nYou deserve better.", "NTA your father sounds pretty crap. He\u2019s not around when you need him. He only calls for money and then threatens to never speak to you again when you won\u2019t give it to him. \n\nYou are making the right choice to ensure you have enough funds to look after yourself first. It\u2019s not like your father would help if you needed money. \n\nYour need to eat and travel to work is far more important than a celebration for a graduation.", "NTA\n\nhe just wants you for money. He is abusive and manipulative.", "You're NTA. If money is that tight in his household, there doesn't need to be an expensive gift or celebration for a graduation.

Block dad after telling him to kick rocks.", "Yes, considering I'm exhibiting symptoms of childhood PTSD and ADHD.", "Him counting doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re not obligated to contribute. This is just a pressure tactic and if anything I think that\u2019s an extra reason not to contribute. He hasn\u2019t contributed for you. But you don\u2019t need to say any of that. \u201cSorry I just don\u2019t have any spare funds. I\u2019m barely able to keep food on the table and I have no discretionary budget at this point in my life\u201d.

I have those as well but I\u2019ve been in 3 years of therapy because of having a shitty father as well.

You are not responsible for your sister - as the parent he is.", "NTA you are NOT the family ATM. They are NOT your responsibility. He needs to grow up and stop expecting you to take care of his responsibilities", "NTA at all.  Your dad is a major a-hole and I am so sorry you have to deal with this garbage.  If your plate is full, it's full and no one, not even a parent, gets to tell you otherwise."]}
