These are users. Allowing them to destroy your work and treat you like shit models to your kids that this is ok behavior for others to do to them, and that you should continue to be a doormat and/or suffer their wrath without retaliation. That is an unacceptable lesson for my child. Being generous is a virtue. Being taken advantage of is a sin. Understanding the difference is part of the wisdom I must impart my child for them to be successful.\n\nI would explain the situation to my kid, and why you are making this choice first. Also explain that this may lead to you no longer being troop leader, but that sometimes it is important to stand up for yourself.\n\nI would then send a message out to the entire troop, all parents and kids, and shine light on the situation. Include the text messages as screen shots. Show everyone who these parents are, what you had been doing for them. Document every situation, and show folks that this is what happened and this is why you are currently being reviewed by the Scout leaders due to their complaints. Finish with saying \"there is a limit to generosity, and that's when it becomes taken advantage of by selfish people. I will no longer be driving kids to scouts beyond those I choose myself. And neither of these two will be included. If that means I lose my position as scout leader, so be it.\"\n\nAnd let chips fall where they may. Because while scouts is important, the lesson here is more important. You take bullies and show their bullshit in the light of the sun and let the court of public opinion destroy them. There is nothing abusers hate more than having the truth of their behavior shown to their peers, so they use authority, like the scout complaint, to keep you silent. You don't play by their rules. You smash them and live free of their abuse. That's the lesson to teach your scout.\n\nNTA", "NTA- You're not responsible for the transportation of other people's children.

I'm going to send out a message telling them I will no longer be providing rides to any child I'm not responsible for.", "Yep. You learned the hard way what a lot of us in childcare and community outreach programs have to learn: no good deed goes unpunished, and it doesn\u2019t pay to bend over backwards for someone who won\u2019t help themselves.\n\nDo your job. If their kids don\u2019t get to come, that sucks, but it is what it is. \n\nWhen you bend the rules, even to help someone, you\u2019re always risking pushback, so it\u2019s best not to. They\u2019re there for a reason. And even if you\u2019ve been bending them for Jimmy\u2019s mom, nine times out of ten Jimmy\u2019s mom will be the reason you get in trouble for it.
