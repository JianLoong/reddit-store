You are being short-sighted and selfish right now and I hope you read a bit about it and start taking responsibility for your part of the infant care. For some things you can't help yet - baby is probably being breastfed still, probably no bottled breastmilk yet, etc. But you can check if baby is crying because a nappy needs to be changed (and change it).\n\nIt only takes one of you to sort your baby girl out.

People can get psychosis and insane depression from sleep deprivation, which also - sadly - means some sleep deprived people think of harming themselves and their babies.\n\nYou\u2019re seeing it as very transactional - \u201cI work, she takes care of the baby\u201d - but in effect that means HER job is 24/7 as a parent, available all hours of the day AND night.\n\nIf you are making her do all the getting up in the night, I hope there is time after work or on days off when you give her a break to catch up on sleep.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be harsh, because being a new parent is a culture shock. It\u2019s tough on both parents. I understand being worried about your job (especially if it involves, say, a lot of driving or use of machinery, or even just mental acuity which does suffer from sleep deprivation). So I can\u2019t call you an AH for those fears and worries. But don\u2019t just abandon your GF either to do it all (and perhaps you aren\u2019t).

When you become a parent you say goodbye to a good night's sleep for a long time. It doesn't matter that you work, you can't pick and choose when to be a parent and when not to be. You are always a parent.", "It sounds likes she's taking care of the baby by herself. She has to get up in the morning to take care of the baby. That's a full time job.

She will be telling her family and friends that she's taking care of the baby by herself. A baby is a lifetime commitment.

I have a 6 month old so my boyfriend and I went through this not long ago. We even set up an extra bed in the nursery because I was worried about his sleep. The reality of being parents to a young baby is that both of you are going to lose sleep. I hope you both did have that expectation before now, but it was much harder for me when the time came than I thought it would be. \n\nThe commenters aren\u2019t wrong, it\u2019s important for mom to get her rest because she IS healing from a major health event that\u2019s been affecting her body for yearly a year, and will take at least 6 months to feel somewhat normal again, probably closer to a year. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important for you to get rest too, but it might be impossible for a bit. \n\nAs others are suggesting, it might be better to suggest to her you take turns or shifts. Make sure there\u2019s time she gets at least a 2-3 hour stretch of sleep too, and at least 5-6 if you can (for all of your sakes). Make sure you are up to date on baby\u2019s needs and schedule so you can help without being asked (example how often baby eats and how much, how often baby needs diaper checked or changed, what type of cry signals what need or what your baby does to let you know they\u2019re hungry, etc). When they\u2019re this little it can change day by day, it\u2019s a huge burden to mom if she\u2019s the only one who knows the routine since you can\u2019t effectively help out when you\u2019re home without her supervising and guiding you. \n\nIf you could let her get a long stretch of sleep in the afternoon/evening when you get home I think it would be reasonable for you to ask to sleep elsewhere. ONLY if her needs are all met too. \n\nI know it\u2019s difficult right now, hang in there. Congrats on the little one!", "YTA.\n\nA massive one.

With the first baby the biggest lesson is how to not be selfish. You need to constantly put another person before what you want/need/desire and it\u2019s probably one of the most difficult parts of being a new parent. \n\nThese sleepless nights will only be such a small portion of your child\u2019s life and they\u2019ll be done before you know it. HOWEVER, if you do/say something stupid with your girlfriend about this she will remember FOREVER. \n\nYou are both going to be tired during this time. Give grace and patience to each other. You need to give extra to your girlfriend, she\u2019s more exhausted than you, her body is recovering from major trauma, her hormones are all over the place.

You girlfriend gets not time away from the baby and I can assure you that\u2019s way worse than whatever your job is.", "YTA because based on how immaturely you\u2019re referring to your gf and baby, I can guarantee that you\u2019re also not helping with dishes, cooking, cleaning, bottles (if necessary). I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not handling any research needs if there\u2019s a problem with the baby (colic, gas, preemptively looking up how to save a baby from choking, nipple flow rate sizes, wake windows and sleeping requirements). \n\nMy DH considered sleeping in another room because at the time I was pumping exclusively (in the same room we slept in with the baby by the way). I would have let him if he really needed to because I knew that he would help me feed the baby in the middle of the night since I would sometimes have to pump twice for 45 min sessions and then lo and behold the baby would wake up and I\u2019d have to feed her too. He was also cooking meals, washing all bottles, and making me coffee and breakfast every morning, taking care of me as I healed from a c section. Running things up and down the stairs and policing me so I wouldn\u2019t insist on going up and down stairs in our house. Protecting me from toxic family. \n\nSo you would not be TA if you were doing all of those things for your gf, but I would bet money that none of those things, none of the consideration she deserves, has been given to her. \n\nThink long and hard about your commitment level and do better. Nobody deserves to have a selfish partner, parenting is hard enough and I waited until I was ready for it. On the flip side, you need to communicate better with your partner about your needs. Parenting and relationships are give and take, but neither of you can assume the other knows what you need.  Talk openly and without judgement. Your gf is in the most vulnerable state she\u2019s ever been in. Even if you approach her about sleeping in the other room, she may say yes just to avoid fighting with you if you are normally reactive and argumentative. So I would take the permission with a grain of salt. No \u201cwell you said I could\u2026.\u201d Take ownership in your part as a parent.

What do you expect? Your daughter doesn't know days and nights yet and needs to be fed every two hours. Do your part, too.

Look at you talking about how you don't appreciate this and that. Not once did you mention caring about what your girlfriend is struggling with as a new mom.

It doesn't pay money. Its a choice and a responsibility. And like you said it is HER job since she isn't bringing any money in. Each parent needs to take on their different roles.

Who is paying the bills when the only person making money loses their job or gets injured/injures someone due to exhaustion? Between the hours he gets home and needs to sleep,  he should be doing 50/50 and giving her time for herself. Its not like he can call her up at work and demand she come in to do his tasks because he's tired. Unless she gets a part time paying job,  and op goes down to part time.  He is not ta for wanting to make sure they don't end up homeless. It sounds like he is suffering from ppd as well. Its better he removes himself instead of something awful happening.

A 24/7 job.\n\nAgree... Though... The one providing the income should be saved a bit on working nights, no matter who it is. When both are working, tasks should be rotating (for example, when nightfeeds are no longer breastmilk, rotate the one who is not sleeping in the same room as the baby to both be able to get a better night of sleep). When she is the sole provider, he should get up more often during the night. You are both trying to make the household working, providing an income to that is part of that and absolutely necessary for the the whole family, but taking care of a newborn is that as well.\n\nMakes me think of my childhood. My father worked shifts, my mother always told him, when he was not working in the morning, to stay away and don't intervene in her morning routine. Whereas, because my father had more PTO than my mother, he took the schoolholidays off more to stay home and parent us. Also, when he was not working mornings, he would make sure to be home for lunch with us, or even be up already when he had a nightshift.\n\nFor OP, it can be reasonable... When he also offers to let her sleep in the other room as well on alternating nights.
