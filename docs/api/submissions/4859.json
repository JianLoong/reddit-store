No curfew or anything silly like that. During her stay, her boyfriend ended up homeless, she begged us to let him stay, even offered to pay rent. We said no. The boyfriend was a complete stranger to us.\n\nKaty\u2019s stay had issues, like her losing her job, constantly needing money from us, and just not taking care of herself. After her being jobless and living on food stamps and our help for 6 months, we finally said she had to find somewhere to go because it was clear we weren\u2019t helping her find independence. She finally moved out to stay with her boyfriend\u2019s sister. That didn\u2019t last long as she\u2019s at Diane\u2019s again, I have no idea why but I can guess.\n\nWhile Katy was with us, we never went upstairs EVER.

It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. She had no reason not to use the bathroom downstairs and she wouldn\u2019t be able to pee in the jugs without a funnel.\n\nNow Diane is mad at me because I won\u2019t \u201cput on my big girl panties\u201d to play nice with Katy so she can have a nice Christmas. My husband is going but I just can\u2019t. I tried to talk to Katy, she apologized in text for \u201cthe state of the room\u201d but didn\u2019t admit to what she\u2019d done for it to end up that way even when asked directly.

If she wants to continue to tolerate Katy and her behavior (whatever it might be), that's her choice.  It's your choice not to tolerate Katy.", "NTA", "ESH.\n\nJust go and not speak to her. Based on her behaviour she has serious mental health issues and you shouldn't take it personally. Look past it and chalk it up to experience.", "But make sure you say it in a way that it sounds like \n\n\"you're sorry how I acted, but because she did xyz, it took some doing to forgive her for it.  But I'm good now!\" And say it in a somewhat chipper tone.\n\nNTA", "Yeah, this coupled with the fact that she lost her job etc sounds like Katy is suffering severe mental illness. You know what doesn\u2019t help mental illness? Isolation from friends and loved ones\u2026 ie: her boyfriend. \n\nWe have no context to how her boyfriend became homeless or Katy\u2019s behaviour while she lived there.\n\nI have so many questions here. Did they ever see her use a bathroom? Did they ever see her bring food or plates or garbage out of her room? Did they ever see her at all? Did they not notice how no extra garbage was in their disposal bin? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like this was a separate suite here. They said she bought her own food but was welcome to use theirs. I feel like if she was that down on her luck and and felt comfortable in the home she would have. Like did she ever cook? I\u2019m so confused. \n\nThe situation sucks, and I don\u2019t blame OP for not wanting to see her and being angry because I would be upset if someone disrespected my home like that. \n\nKaty needs professional help and empathy here. She was LIVING in that room for how long and never was able to clean it? Nobody can live in that sort of space and unless their self worth is so low that they think they deserve it.", "She does have bpd I think\u2026 she\u2019d told me a long time ago so I\u2019m not entirely sure about the letters, but I think it was bpd. She\u2019s also depressed.", "That is one thing I keep wondering, how she\u2019ll be able to look her brother in the eye after what she did to him. I\u2019m just the SIL but that man practically raised her\u2026 I\u2019d never have the nerve to look at him again.", "We\u2019ve offered to take her to the doctor, we often bought her medicine, I\u2019d tried to help her get on disability for her mental health, and we\u2019d treated her as gently as absolutely possible\u2026 I don\u2019t know what else we can do. She\u2019s been to the hospital for her mental health a few times and always leaves with their blessing.", "[deleted]", "Remember Rickrolling people? Now think about smell phones.", "Uhh no, you do that over a toilet so that whatever you don't catch goes in the toilet. If she did that over a regular jug any miss would go on the floor.", "Thank you very much \ud83d\udc9c\n\nThe lesson we learned is that anyone staying longer than a night is only allowed to pitch a tent in the yard lol", "She\u2019s VERY entitled and usually responds with crying.  And sadly, she\u2019s pulled similar stuff with her sister.  Also made rude comments about how it\u2019s on her to give her mom grandkids because the rest of us married couples are clearly struggling to get pregnant for various reasons.  She\u2019s burned a lot of bridges at this point.", "Lol, I like that idea!", "Umm\u2026. While the boyfriend *might* have *also* been staying there, I\u2019m pretty sure some of the waste was hers. I don\u2019t feel sorry for her but I can definitely see a depressed and hopeless person doing that. Still her own fault (and I say that as a depressed and medicated person who takes responsibility for themselves and their actions). Still, NTA", "I've watched hoarders enough to know that it's entirely possible that she pooped and peeped in those jugs herself. Your option is likely but what she said can't be counted as untrue. My sister had a bedroom that was 10 ft from a bathroom and when she moved out my parents found similar things in her closet. People are weird and your NTA", "NTA!  If you and your husband like Diane, pay her a solo visit before Xmas so there are no hard feelings.  No way I would be in the same room with Katy as I'd want to choke her out.  Disgusting.", "Ewwwww\n\nGross gross gross gross..\n\n\nNTA. Gross.", "*thousand yard stare*\n\n*million yard stare*\n\nOk, that's enough internet for today.\n\n\nFor the record, NTA, I would burn my house to the ground if I found that, and tell absolutely anyone who asked about letting her move in what happened.\n\nOffer to come on the condition that you'll periodically just shit in random places.  Will it be a bathroom?  Will it be the dinner table?  Find out next week!\n\nI need a fucking drink after this post.", "NTA for sure. My god. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Nta, but i would have a toss ip if i was more upset about the state of the room or her having a complete stranger living in the same house as me.", "Maybe her aim wasn\u2019t so great and that\u2019s why the floor was sticky.", "If you show her the photos please post a update!", "I say buy Katy a gift, print the photos out in a huge size and use those to wrap said gift. Make a huge deal of presenting the gift and saying you used pics of how Katy left the room to wrap it. That\u2019s def what I would do. NTA", "Oh god I'm going to hell, why is this so funny?!?", "So what you're saying is... he came out of the closet about it?", "Maybe that\u2019s why the floor with sticky\u2026", "Photoshop a tiny Santa hat onto the largest turd pile for the piece de resistance"]}
