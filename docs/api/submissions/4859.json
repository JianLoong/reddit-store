She was living with their grandma \u201cDiane\u201d but they had a falling out so we offered her the upstairs, rent free. It\u2019s just a single bedroom up there so she had the upstairs all to herself, we only used it for storage. She paid nothing, only bought her own food but was also welcome to use our food too. This was suppose to last a few months while she saved money for an apartment.\n\nOnly house rule we had was Katy couldn\u2019t bring people over without notice or when no one was home and NEVER to spend the night. No curfew or anything silly like that. During her stay, her boyfriend ended up homeless, she begged us to let him stay, even offered to pay rent. We said no. The boyfriend was a complete stranger to us.\n\nKaty\u2019s stay had issues, like her losing her job, constantly needing money from us, and just not taking care of herself. After her being jobless and living on food stamps and our help for 6 months, we finally said she had to find somewhere to go because it was clear we weren\u2019t helping her find independence. She finally moved out to stay with her boyfriend\u2019s sister. That didn\u2019t last long as she\u2019s at Diane\u2019s again, I have no idea why but I can guess.\n\nWhile Katy was with us, we never went upstairs EVER. We respected her privacy and had no reason to be there. The day she left I went upstairs to find garbage bags everywhere, old food all over the floor, the floor was sticky, it smelled\u2026 I didn\u2019t spend long looking, didn\u2019t even walk through the door, just left it for my husband to see when he got home from work. Husband took a deeper look\u2026 he found the following\u2026\n\n- trash bags with HUMAN feces in them \n- at least 10 gallon jugs full of urine \n- a tote with cat littler and an unidentifiable sludge we guessed was human feces and urine\n\nWhile leaving this is horrible, I realized something else\u2026 Katy must have snuck her boyfriend into the house and he was living up there with her, peeing in jugs and pooping in bags because he couldn\u2019t come downstairs to use the bathroom or risk being caught by us. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. She had no reason not to use the bathroom downstairs and she wouldn\u2019t be able to pee in the jugs without a funnel.\n\nNow Diane is mad at me because I won\u2019t \u201cput on my big girl panties\u201d to play nice with Katy so she can have a nice Christmas. My husband is going but I just can\u2019t. I tried to talk to Katy, she apologized in text for \u201cthe state of the room\u201d but didn\u2019t admit to what she\u2019d done for it to end up that way even when asked directly. Her reason was she was depressed. If she had told the truth I would play nice for the sake of Diane, I would suffer through Christmas quietly and most likely drunk, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to look at her\u2026\n\nWIBTA for not going so Diane can have a happy family Christmas?", "created_utc": 1671181026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zna8x1/wibta_for_skipping_my_husbands_grandmas_christmas/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
