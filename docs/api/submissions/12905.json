Yes, sure. Is that the reason I am debating on not going? *NO* my decision to not go is based entirely on their attitude through what\u2019s been this month and it\u2019s also been based on my sons current feelings.

Not my wedding not my rules to make plus I don\u2019t have \u201cchildren,\u201d my only kid is 16 year olds and I am a single mom so the whole idea of going to the wedding to enjoy a fun night to myself without kids is not something new nor is it something I\u2019ve had to worry about for a while. \n\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t with the rule-the issue is that the invitation originally came with two tickets and we didn\u2019t think much of it because he\u2019s not a child so why wouldn\u2019t he be invited. Turns out the no child rule involves anyone under the age of 18 and we found out when my son brought up the wedding during a family dinner and both my SIL and brother seemed taken aback which then led to questions and them finding out they had accidentally sent out two tickets which then led to an awkward conversation and my son getting un-invited in front of the people present. \n\n\nI\u2019m genuinely trying really hard to understand their side and the fact that it\u2019s their wedding not mine but I cannot get past the idea of the way they did so and how they made my son feel.

I would say me choosing to not attend is nothing personal but I\u2019d be lying if I did so.

It's pretty blatant that if someone invites you to something with stipulations you can't comfortably meet, declining is the obvious and acceptable answer. NTA if the couple called you names. NAH if someone else did since it's not their conflict.", "NTA. I'd sit it out.  Maybe the extra ticket was an honest mistake, but do they really expect the name calling to change OP's mind?  Their mistake, their shitty response, they're the AHs.\n\nBesides, child free means some folks can't attend.  Its the choice you make.  If they won't make an exception due to age and the already purchased plane ticket they've found out that some decisions have consequences they won't like.", "By the time the wedding rolls around on 2024 will he be 18?", "It\u2019s always hard to see that people don\u2019t reciprocate your feelings (such as your brother being a surrogate father figure to your son). All of the childfree weddings I\u2019ve experienced meant kids who were young teens and under. 16 was never a problem. Personally, I don\u2019t understand excluding family from a wedding celebration, but that\u2019s me.

If the invite had come with only one ticket to get into the wedding you would have still gone. (Still upset that your son couldn't go being under age 18, and his close ties to his uncle. )\n\n\n The reason you are now refusing to go is they had basically invited your son with giving you 2 tickets, and then publicly uninvited him and  started name calling you.\n\n>I\u2019ve been getting called immature, petty, and a bitch", "Would have been N A H if they'd spoken to you and your son about it in private later.

No hard feelings on either side.\nMistakes were made on their part with the extra ticket, but now that it\u2019s been cleared up, and you don\u2019t want to go, then don\u2019t go.

The misunderstanding is 100% their doing. Unless, of course, the venue is 18+ or something?\n\nI too wouldn't really class a 16 year old as a child.

Uninviting family and doing so in the way they did is so mean, they should have kept quiet and accepted that they did invite your son.\n\nYour feelings are valid and the fact you're being called these bad names for not wanting to attend their wedding is cruel. No need to go if you haven't forgiven them, enjoy your peace elsewhere.", "NTA. I feel like it was reasonable to expect that the the circumstances of this child free wedding business could be flexible for your son, as your younger brother is like his older brother. \n\nAlso, very weird to be sending invites to a wedding in 2024 at this point in time. A save the date sure but an invite with an rsvp? Weird.", "NTA - do something special with your son over the wedding. He will appreciate you standing by him and not doing a dump and run.

Unless it's your own wedding - and even then you might not be TA.", "NTA. It's an invite your presence isn't mandatory. I also don't believe couples have 18+ weddings to spite anyone. YWBTA if you keep pressing the issue. Simply don't RSVP and leave it at that.", "Ouch! NTA. Even if the decision not to attend is personal and even if you get attacked for it, if you are not in the headspace to enjoy the event, why go? IMO they should have included your son, but it is their wedding, their rules. You do not have to feel obligated. If you get hassled for not attending, tell the haters that you can't attend because of \"child care\". It will be truthful. You care for your son and would rather be with him.", "If you received two invitations, I think most people would have assumed you were both invited. The way they uninvited your son publicly is really rude and I understand why he's hurt.\n\nIt's a bit of a shitty situation. Even if they invite your son now, he knows they don't want him there and are just doing it to make up for their mistake. They're allowed to decide on their guest list but you're also allowed to decide whether to go. NAH but they're the one that messed up and should have been way more careful!", "NTA If they're going to call you awful names and revoke your son's invitation why would you want to go? If they think so little of you and call you names and not take in your son's hurt feelings into consideration before revoking that invitation I'd stay home.", "NTA. Your son is 16, not 6. If the wedding is not for a year he\u2019ll be 17 at that point. And like you said there were two tickets in the invite and no mention that \u201cchildren\u201d meant anyone under 18. Had your brother and sil addressed this in private, that would be different. But to uninvite someone in front of others is just plain wrong.", "NTA. What's with sending tickets? And the name calling? They don't sound like pleasant people", "Nta.  \n\nI understand this whole child free wedding stuff. Kids suck.  Crying babies. Whiney tantrum kids. All extremely horrible. \n\nBut there's a huge difference between your cousins 4yo that you see twice a year and your 16yo nephew that you see so often that you are considered a brother.", "NTA.  \nI wouldve gone with N A H if they hadnt resolved to extra ticket publicly, and made a whole thing about it. I think it was fair to assume that it was one ticked for you and one for your son since he isnt a small child and since they decided to do a public un-invite that hurt your son i think its reasonable for you to stay home if u decide to ( honestly a very sincere apology and some kind of gesture to make up for it from your brother and his fiance to your son is the least that you should expect.)  \n\n\nThey couldve handled it in so many other ways, since they choose to do it this way i say that you are NTA.", "NTA. It's an invitation, not a summons. You are allowed to chose if you want to go or not. They are allowed to make whatever rules they want about their wedding, but should realize that not everyone will want to attend. Personally, I think a child-free wedding should be CHILD free, not teenager-free. Teens generally know how to behave at weddings. If your teen has behavioural issues that you are not mentioning, then I can understand their logic. Or maybe there is another behavioural teen they are trying to exclude and yours just happened to fall in the crossfire. Either way, I don't think you are the asshole for not attending.", "NTA - 16 isn't really a child as such anymore, it's a teen, and he'll be nearly 18 anyway when the wedding happens. It's not like he'll be running up and down the aisle or knocking people over on the dance floor!\n\nAlso as someone pointed out above, it's a wedding, not a summons - you don't have to go full stop. And your reasons for not going are perfectly valid, so don't go, and don't feel guilty, this is on them not you.", "NTA - 16 years old is really difficult for me to consider as a child. I definitely think that you would be well within reason to decline to attend. I would as well, were I in your shoes.", "For someone to humiliate and hurt your son at a family dinner by making them\nFeel unincluded, you are doing the right thing. There is a time and a place for those conversations and that was not the place! Child free weddings usually mean preteens, not teens.", "NTA, given you received 2 tickets and your son will be 17 at time and of the wedding I can see why you\u2019d assume you\u2019re both invited.", "Info: did the invitation have his name or guest on it?\nIf guest or just your name you should have clarified the 2 tickets. If your son's name then you arent to blame.", "NTA- What the fuck, for the sake of one person (also afamily member and also a teenager not a child) \n\nThere was no point in making him feel excluded. Weird move.", "Nta, he's not a toddler! Bit weird!", "NTA. Seems like you aren't trying to make this about you. You are clearly respecting their rule for this wedding. I am guessimg your son is pretty hurt that he got uninvited especially since he looks up to your brother . At 16 I feel like your son knows how to behave at the wedding but like you said it is not your wedding and not your rules. The wedding will go on without you being there and im sure there will be plenty of photos or even a video of the event they can show you after. Seems completely ok to decline an invite", "~~I.N.F.O.: How was the invitation addressed?~~\n\nNAH. They didn't address the invite like they were inviting your son, and did specify on the invitation that it was a child free wedding. Your son is ultimately still a child, even if he is an older one. The second ticket was so you could presumably bring an (adult) guest.\n\nThat said, you certainly aren't required to attend any wedding you don't want to go to. I think perhaps you should have picked up the phone and clarified the invitation when you received it (especially when you saw the child free information) and are now making a regretful and hasty decision to not go to your brother's wedding.", "There are multiple possible reasons for the no child rule.\n\n1. Wanting to minimize disruptions.\n2. Wanting to ban Johns kids without offending John.\n3. Wanting to incorporate some more adult themes.\n4. The venue being limited to a certain age.\n\nWe don't know which it is, and neither do you. Which makes it weird that you want to escalate this a year before the wedding, when there's so much time to still resolve this.\nPublicly uninviting him was certainly not a nice thing to do, but there are better ways to fix this than boycotting the wedding.

But he seems old enough to go. Honestly I\u2019m unsure if you are the asshole or not. I think child free weddings are kind of great so I get why they are having one. But I consider children over 12 able to handle themselves and not run around like crazy people. I think it\u2019s okay to decline the invite but I do not think it\u2019s okay to go off on them.

I, as nicely as I could manage, told him that we would not be coming at all in that case.

If you're going to make a stipulation that people with children can't bring their kids you should also have the understanding that that probably implies those people are not coming.

Mormon wedding ceremonies happen in the temple, and you can't attend if you're not a member, and even if you are a member, you have to have done certain things to qualify to be able to go into that part of the temple. Like, you can go in one part once you're twelve, but you can't go into the main part where weddings happen until you do the endowment, which most people do around the time they're 18 (I never did do it, because I was dealing with doubts, and felt like I should get rid of them before I did the endowment.... spoilers, I never did). \n\nAnd besides that, from what I've heard, the ceremony room is often pretty small, so you only really have room for like, your top ten most important people.\n\nPoint of all of that, is that in Mormon culture, the reception kinda *is* the wedding for most people, and is treated accordingly. The ceremony is kinda a non factor, unless the couple has enough important non members in their life that they decide to have a second, non temple ceremony after the temple one.

And I know I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for using this to vent, but childfree weddings are freaking DUMB. Weddings are celebrations of families coming together, and excluding children from them is ridiculously insane. I've been to a ton of weddings, all of them with kids of all ages, and none of them have EVER \"ruined\" a wedding. If you think a baby crying or a toddler running around foolishly is going to ruin your big day, you're full of yourself to the point of narcissism. Get over it.\n\nWhat's next, no kids allowed to your family gettogether for your birthday? No kids allowed when you host your family Christmas? Ridiculous.", "NTA. You're right that this is definitely a different situation from the rest of the stories about this on here. They absolutely could have handled it better. And expecting parents to readily go to this wedding and find someone to watch their kid is unreasonable. If they can, great, if they can't they can't. They sent two tickets. Whether by accident or not, it sent a lot of confusion. And while they can say childfree means under 18, that's not the case. Many people who have child free weddings mean kids under 15 because they don't want screaming toddlers and kids getting bored and rowdy. I've also seen weddings where it meant no one under 21. But the age was always specified. \n\nThis was a confusion caused by them by sending two tictickets and not specifying that they meant no one under 18. It's a confusion caused by them not paying attention to what they were sending out. And as everyone knows when you send out invitations, you have to be really careful about them. \n\nAs for the uninvited, there's a better way to go about it. They could have taken the both of you aside and been like \"hey, we're so sorry. We meant no one under 18 and the second ticket was a slip of the mind since we sent two tickets to everyone.\" They could have been gentle and quiet about it instead of humiliating your child in front of people. \n\nYou not wanting to go is valid and fine and the fact they're being a holes about it just shows their true colors tbh. Your son will remember this moment for the rest of his life. He'll remember the confusion caused by a lack of consideration, he'll remember the public humiliation. He'll remember how upset they got over this incident at you and will likely blame himself, they created these moments for him. If I was a mother, I definitely wouldn't go.

Childfree wedding is not a thing in my culture, only saw it on reddit but I can understand not wanting young children there who can be loud/disruptive.

Sometimes it really is just about how much everyone will be drinking (which is typically much more at a wedding that a baby shower, lol). \n\nThere's a number of reasons you might cut teens out. I feel like everyone in this thread who's upset about it is barely out of their teen years and doesn't like the idea they would recently have been excluded in this scenario,", "It's always infuriating and vaguely hilarious when people like that *miss why an entire plot point is important context* just so they can spew their bullshit.

But whenever she got frustrated with him, she always came back to THIS issue. \n\nBut I JUST now realized something though that I had never really thought of. Part of the problem was that he was all set to go, then at the last minute she postponed the wedding a year and he had lost his job, but I realize he was likely in mourning because that was the same year his mom, our grandma died.\n\nI'm honestly really frustrated with her at the moment due to her now acting like my uncle.

That combined with the initial two tickets... I don't understand why he wouldn't be invited even with the child-free rule. I'd say skip the wedding and do something special with her son that day for sure.", "Exactly. The poor kid was publicly humiliated by his father figure and family.

It would have really hurt my daughters feelings/ego to be lumped in with kids when at 16 they can handle themselves well, especially at a family event.", "That's what I'm thinking. It may not be THE Issue but it is AN issue and I'm sure is a big reason why op isn't attending.", "This is why I would have second thoughts leaving a 16/17 year old unsupervised for more than a day or two.

They need to feel some control because it\u2019s happening to them. Your son is the one being disappointed & excluded. He has his own relationship with his uncle & he should feel like he has the power to voice his concerns & be part of the solution to their problems.\n\nI really do empathize with you feeling hurt for your son & wanting to hurt the people who hurt him but just try to remember this is really about your son. He should feel like his Mom is willing to help him & allow him to have some control of how this problem is resolved.

No 16 year old, who will he 17 at the time of said event, views themselves as a \"child\" even if legally they are not an adult yet.  He thought his uncle and aunt valued him enough to want to include him in their special day. He thought they were close, and would want him at their wedding. They told him to his face in front of other people that he was just a kid and wasn't wanted. I'm sure that's not the words they used, but guarantee that's the message your son received. That's something a person doesn't forget. Their relationship will never be the same. If he finds out they have been insulting his mother about it on top of everything, that will probably just be the final nail in the coffin of that relationship.", "It\u2019s already been damaged. Too late now", "> I hope their relationship does not get damaged over a ticket.\n\npeople saying \"the relationship is damaged it's too late\" are being a little too pessimistic imo and it's extremely unhelpful and damaging in itself. \n\nEverything gets damaged, literally everything. This isn't an end all or a fork in the road in which the relationship changes for the negative forever. You have until 2024 to think and speak about this amongst yourselves. I believe ya'll will be okay if you want to be. Communication is clearly key here, as lack of it has created this rift. It is mendable, just let your feelings be known and don't let this fester and then dissolve into your relationships together, poisoning them. Family (and friend) relationships can become so senselessly poisoned - do not let it happen - it sounds like your son and your brother needed and will continue to need each other on an emotionally comforting level. Please just talk to each other when you feel comfortable enough. Don't let this be the thing that sparks a divide. \n\nDon't stop validating your sons feelings. It's comforting to hear you both confided in each other about this. Keep that connection.", "Yeah, that's what I got from it.\n\nWas very confused by the notion of \"They said it was child-free.

The fact that you inherently dismissed that fact is troubling.  Secondly, he  was not \"uninvited\" - he was never invited and all your brother and SIL did was clarify the rules that no one under 18 was invited.  As for sending two tickets, people usually include a possible +1 so sending you two doesn't seem out of place.\n\nPersonally, I am sorry for your son as it is a fine line and I can see why he is hurt he isn't invited.

We're close in size and she's been ransacking my closet since she was 11, so I guess she knows my style!", "Only child?", "Wait!  We\u2019re you at my wedding?", "They should have done that, if this was anyone but their almost-an-adult nephew. They just destroyed their relationship with this kid. He\u2019s never going to forget this. This is a situation where you swallow your pride and accept that there will be one 16 year old at your wedding.", "Yes! I totally agree. And just to add on that the refusing guest also isn't allowed to butthurt when the couple don't change their restrictions when you say you won't come if they insist on said restrictions. Everyone should be adults and accept or decline the invitation without it descending into name calling and upset", "This. I\u2019m lucky in that my family isn\u2019t well off so weddings are small somewhat  inexpensive casual affairs and we all pitch in to decorate, make cakes, dresses, etc. Most of my 14 nephews and nieces are married now and they\u2019re just as married as those couples with the 80k weddings.", "Or having a baby", "Yep. I\u2019ve said it a few times on here: people are not props. I would automatically decline to attend any event like that.", "Yep. He just found out an arbitrary age cutoff is more important than their relationship. No way that\u2019s not painful.", "Honestly my family stays doing this with the kids table making me sit there at 24 because im a single woman and letting my younger also single male cousin sit with the rest of the adults. They used the sexist excuse of me taking care of the kids while they ate (the youngest is capable of eating without supervision and is very mature for 7, the rest were teenagers who could've watched the kid if need be) luckily my little cousin saw that it was unfair and sat with me at the kids table in solidarity. It definitely does destroy the relationships I had with the older relatives.", "Close nibling that you have UNinvited to your wedding PUBLICLY.", "That's the best kind of drag queen!! Sounds like a blast, what a way to kick off a marriage \ud83e\udd73 congratulations!", "You\u2019re kinder than I am. People like this deserve to know why you aren\u2019t attending.", "Sending you an internet hug. I'm sorry you've been through so much, sib. \u2764\ufe0f", "Why are they sending out save the dates for a wedding next year??", "That would have been unkind. Uninviting him publicly was cruel.", "\ud83d\ude02 right?", "I wish you the best too! :) I am hopeful you will find someone to just be real with on a level that touches your soul! Not the kind where we are all high together connection, but a real one. Yaknow what I mean? \n\nI feel that drawing the line comment so much, I currently struggling with popping a pill or two or 3\u2026. \ud83e\udd2b. I\u2019m scared to dope sick but I\u2019m ALOT better in my mind and body then I was before.. believe me when I say I feel that my friend, I use \u201cmedicine\u201d but to be real, it\u2019s drugs. Being honest with yourself is a big step and the biggest challenge. If we lie and make excuses to ourselves, it\u2019s easy to do it to others. \n\nIt makes me happy to know, I made you happy in some sort of way. You\u2019re definitely not alone in your struggles. Who knows, maybe this could be our year of enlightenment and peace, in our own way. :)", "Wait.. Your brother isn't inviting your son(his nephew) to his wedding.. Man, what an asshole\n\nYou're NTA. Your family comes as a package and if they don't like it, stuff them, they're not worth wasting your time on", "NTA - banning your 16 year old nephew from your wedding is cold hearted", "I feel like this should be a sticky for AITA wedding questions.\n\nPeople can make whatever conditions they want for attending their wedding. It's their wedding. But they aren't allowed to be mad when people don't attend because they don't like the conditions. Likewise, you can say yes or no, but the conversation is over if you say yes--you abide by the agreement, or don't go.", "How long after you got the invitation was the dinner?", "She could\u2019ve at least payed for her uncle to come if she wanted him to walk him down the aisle that bad if anything she is petty af", "Is she still married? Has she pulled anymore nasty tricks like this? I hope that you're not in her line of fire!", "I\u2019ve seen BS like this floating around on social media. \u201cIf you want to see who will be there for you and who has your back, schedule your wedding out of town.\u201d\nBarf tbh. \n\nSchedule it out of town because it\u2019s somewhere **you** want to have your big day. But know and understand that not everyone can budget in going. It doesn\u2019t mean they object to your marriage, or that they don\u2019t love you, or that they don\u2019t have your back. It probably means they can\u2019t afford it. \n\nAssociating love with spending money you don\u2019t have creates conflict. I hate it. I\u2019m a financial advisor by trade and let me tell you, the people who don\u2019t have a big excess, either because they\u2019re just getting started, often with a big student debt bill, or because they are going through a hard time like a layoff or injury, **already** feel a lot of shame associated with the fact that they have debt, no savings, and need help. Your sister is probably the biggest A in the comments for adding that weight to what your uncle was going through. He probably wasn\u2019t super thrilled to be in the position he was in, and he could have done without someone affirming his fears and reaffirming any shame he felt already. \n\nThat was incredibly gross of her to do. She probably felt like the victim when it was done too. It wasn\u2019t this HUGE party in Vegas for her. So naturally it\u2019s because no one loves her. \ud83d\ude44", "Disagree... they should have acknowledged that a 16 y o isn't a toddler AND is a close family member and accepted that there might be an exception to an otherwise-assinine rule.", "I saw a comment a few years back that said people likely get so intensley focused on wedding culture in part because its one of the very few occasions in society now which allows for fancy formal dress, and we should bring back events like public balls to give more oppertunies for people to dress up if they want to.", "i almost wonder if brother and fsil agreed on child-free but had different ideas of what that meant. Hence 2 tickets. Then bride getting upset and brother going along with whatever she wants.\n\nI'm guessing you're not the only one with a 16/17 yo to have this conversation with them OP", "Agreed. It was very important for me that the whole family was there & the aunties etc on my husbands side got to see all our cute lil munchkins (his side has no children whatsoever). We even found a venue that had a nursery with a crib which at least my sis & SIL used to feed their little ones/do diaper changes.  \n\nI was honestly kind of sad that my friends with babies opted for babysitters but also glad the could have a nice night out.", "And said arbitrary cutoff wasn't even specified on the (save the date? Invitation?). With child free, my first thought would be 12 and over. If it's not specified, it's always better to ask directly or why the age restriction (if it's because of drinking, and permits and legalities involving that, 18 is logical).\n\nI mean, if you have rules, you have to be clear.", "I feel like there's a difference between saying \"This is an 18+ event, please wear cocktail attire\" and \"you can't wear pants or bring your same-sex partner\".", "I\u2019m not in support of it but 43 states currently would allow this person to get married themselves. 20 wouldn\u2019t even require parental consent, so this kid is likely old enough to get married but apparently not old enough to watch someone else get married???\n\nI\u2019m fine with making your wedding 18 or 21+ but it\u2019s absolutely reasonable for this person to assume her nearly adult son was invited when 2 tickets were sent and they say child free. Folks need to be using better terms, teenagers are adolescents, not children.", "Yes.\n\nI\u2019m a straight married woman in her early 40s with kids from 22 down to 7. \n\nI will come to your wedding in black tie, casual, themed, or cocktail attire. With or without my kids- depending on your age limits and dress code.\n\nBut\u2026 if you are also telling women they can\u2019t wear a suit, men they can\u2019t wear a dress, certain people can\u2019t bring their partners, etc,? \n\nThen I will not be attending your shit show.", "I think that attitude is a super old fashioned expectation back when the parents of the bride fully paid for and \"hosted\" the wedding. Like it was their party. A lot of invitations my parents have saved are \"Mr and Mrs so and so invite you to the wedding of their daughter\". In my circles at least, that hasn't been the case for at least two generations but I know quite a few people who had weird power struggles with their parents about the guest list and I assume it's the ghost of those days. Or worse, parents trying to take over all the planning because grandma and grandpa took over theirs and now it's their \"turn\" to get what they actually wanted.", "I\u2019d be more worried about the 24 year old groom, the bride and all their friends causing trouble than a lone sixteen year old there with his mom as his date. \n\nMind you, I was the 15 year old who drank juice and soda water all night at my first wedding while my of age brother tried to sneak me alcohol behind our parents\u2019 back.", "It seems weird to me too.  But I especially think it\u2019s weird when we are talking about older nieces and nephews.   If you aren\u2019t inviting every family friend or neighbors young kid, well that seems reasonable."]}
