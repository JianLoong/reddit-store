Yes, sure. Is that the reason I am debating on not going? *NO* my decision to not go is based entirely on their attitude through what\u2019s been this month and it\u2019s also been based on my sons current feelings. If in a year the situation has bypassed regardless of my son going or not then my decision might change but for now I will stand behind my son and his decision and feelings. Also if the people who are barely reading the post want answers or more details just click my account and check my comments. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of stories on here regarding weddings and child free weddings and overall entitlement but I want to know if I\u2019m right by saying this situation differs to the rest or if I am truly being an asshole. \n\n\nMy younger brother and SIL are getting married next year 2024, and sent out the rsvp earlier this February which is when this whole \u201cfight\u201d started. The invitations include \u201ctickets\u201d to the wedding along with the dress code and a semi-letter letting the attendees know this is a child free wedding along with a few other formalities or rules whatever they want to call them. Not my wedding not my rules to make plus I don\u2019t have \u201cchildren,\u201d my only kid is 16 year olds and I am a single mom so the whole idea of going to the wedding to enjoy a fun night to myself without kids is not something new nor is it something I\u2019ve had to worry about for a while. \n\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t with the rule-the issue is that the invitation originally came with two tickets and we didn\u2019t think much of it because he\u2019s not a child so why wouldn\u2019t he be invited. Turns out the no child rule involves anyone under the age of 18 and we found out when my son brought up the wedding during a family dinner and both my SIL and brother seemed taken aback which then led to questions and them finding out they had accidentally sent out two tickets which then led to an awkward conversation and my son getting un-invited in front of the people present. \n\n\nI\u2019m genuinely trying really hard to understand their side and the fact that it\u2019s their wedding not mine but I cannot get past the idea of the way they did so and how they made my son feel. Also, the fact that I had my son at a really young age and his \u201cdad\u201d was never present so my brother was like a big brother to my son so I think my son (and me) are quite hurt at the idea of my son not attending. I would say me choosing to not attend is nothing personal but I\u2019d be lying if I did so.

It's pretty blatant that if someone invites you to something with stipulations you can't comfortably meet, declining is the obvious and acceptable answer. NTA if the couple called you names. NAH if someone else did since it's not their conflict.", "NTA. I'd sit it out.  Maybe the extra ticket was an honest mistake, but do they really expect the name calling to change OP's mind?  Their mistake, their shitty response, they're the AHs.\n\nBesides, child free means some folks can't attend.  Its the choice you make.

All of the childfree weddings I\u2019ve experienced meant kids who were young teens and under. 16 was never a problem. Personally, I don\u2019t understand excluding family from a wedding celebration, but that\u2019s me.

If the invite had come with only one ticket to get into the wedding you would have still gone. (Still upset that your son couldn't go being under age 18, and his close ties to his uncle. )\n\n\n The reason you are now refusing to go is they had basically invited your son with giving you 2 tickets, and then publicly uninvited him and  started name calling you.\n\n>I\u2019ve been getting called immature, petty, and a bitch", "Would have been N A H if they'd spoken to you and your son about it in private later.

Uninviting family and doing so in the way they did is so mean, they should have kept quiet and accepted that they did invite your son.\n\nYour feelings are valid and the fact you're being called these bad names for not wanting to attend their wedding is cruel. No need to go if you haven't forgiven them, enjoy your peace elsewhere.", "NTA. I feel like it was reasonable to expect that the the circumstances of this child free wedding business could be flexible for your son, as your younger brother is like his older brother. \n\nAlso, very weird to be sending invites to a wedding in 2024 at this point in time. A save the date sure but an invite with an rsvp? Weird.", "NTA - do something special with your son over the wedding. He will appreciate you standing by him and not doing a dump and run.

Unless it's your own wedding - and even then you might not be TA.", "NTA. It's an invite your presence isn't mandatory. I also don't believe couples have 18+ weddings to spite anyone. YWBTA if you keep pressing the issue. Simply don't RSVP and leave it at that.", "Ouch! NTA. Even if the decision not to attend is personal and even if you get attacked for it, if you are not in the headspace to enjoy the event, why go? IMO they should have included your son, but it is their wedding, their rules. You do not have to feel obligated.

You care for your son and would rather be with him.", "If you received two invitations, I think most people would have assumed you were both invited. The way they uninvited your son publicly is really rude and I understand why he's hurt.\n\nIt's a bit of a shitty situation. Even if they invite your son now, he knows they don't want him there and are just doing it to make up for their mistake. They're allowed to decide on their guest list but you're also allowed to decide whether to go. NAH but they're the one that messed up and should have been way more careful!", "NTA If they're going to call you awful names and revoke your son's invitation why would you want to go?

If the wedding is not for a year he\u2019ll be 17 at that point. And like you said there were two tickets in the invite and no mention that \u201cchildren\u201d meant anyone under 18.

They don't sound like pleasant people", "Nta.  \n\nI understand this whole child free wedding stuff. Kids suck.  Crying babies. Whiney tantrum kids. All extremely horrible. \n\nBut there's a huge difference between your cousins 4yo that you see twice a year and your 16yo nephew that you see so often that you are considered a brother.", "NTA.  \nI wouldve gone with N A H if they hadnt resolved to extra ticket publicly, and made a whole thing about it. I think it was fair to assume that it was one ticked for you and one for your son since he isnt a small child and since they decided to do a public un-invite that hurt your son i think its reasonable for you to stay home if u decide to ( honestly a very sincere apology and some kind of gesture to make up for it from your brother and his fiance to your son is the least that you should expect.)  \n\n\nThey couldve handled it in so many other ways, since they choose to do it this way i say that you are NTA.", "NTA. It's an invitation, not a summons. You are allowed to chose if you want to go or not. They are allowed to make whatever rules they want about their wedding, but should realize that not everyone will want to attend. Personally, I think a child-free wedding should be CHILD free, not teenager-free. Teens generally know how to behave at weddings. If your teen has behavioural issues that you are not mentioning, then I can understand their logic. Or maybe there is another behavioural teen they are trying to exclude and yours just happened to fall in the crossfire. Either way, I don't think you are the asshole for not attending.", "NTA - 16 isn't really a child as such anymore, it's a teen, and he'll be nearly 18 anyway when the wedding happens. It's not like he'll be running up and down the aisle or knocking people over on the dance floor!\n\nAlso as someone pointed out above, it's a wedding, not a summons - you don't have to go full stop. And your reasons for not going are perfectly valid, so don't go, and don't feel guilty, this is on them not you.", "NTA - 16 years old is really difficult for me to consider as a child. I definitely think that you would be well within reason to decline to attend. I would as well, we\u2019re I in your shoes.", "For someone to humiliate and hurt your son at a family dinner by making them\nFeel unincluded, you are doing the right thing. There is a time and a place for those conversations and that was not the place! Child free weddings usually mean preteens, not teens.", "NTA, given you received 2 tickets and your son will be 17 at time and of the wedding I can see why you\u2019d assume you\u2019re both invited.", "Info: did the invitation have his name or guest on it?\nIf guest or just your name you should have clarified the 2 tickets. If your son's name then you arent to blame.", "NTA- What the fuck, for the sake of one person (also afamily member and also a teenager not a child) \n\nThere was no point in making him feel excluded. Weird move.", "Nta, he's not a toddler! Bit weird!", "NTA. Seems like you aren't trying to make this about you. You are clearly respecting their rule for this wedding. I am guessimg your son is pretty hurt that he got uninvited especially since he looks up to your brother . At 16 I feel like your son knows how to behave at the wedding but like you said it is not your wedding and not your rules. The wedding will go on without you being there and im sure there will be plenty of photos or even a video of the event they can show you after. Seems completely ok to decline an invite", "~~I.N.F.O.: How was the invitation addressed?~~\n\nNAH. They didn't address the invite like they were inviting your son, and did specify on the invitation that it was a child free wedding. Your son is ultimately still a child, even if he is an older one. The second ticket was so you could presumably bring an (adult) guest.\n\nThat said, you certainly aren't required to attend any wedding you don't want to go to. I think perhaps you should have picked up the phone and clarified the invitation when you received it (especially when you saw the child free information) and are now making a regretful and hasty decision to not go to your brother's wedding.", "There are multiple possible reasons for the no child rule.\n\n1. Wanting to minimize disruptions.\n2. Wanting to ban Johns kids without offending John.\n3. Wanting to incorporate some more adult themes.\n4. The venue being limited to a certain age.\n\nWe don't know which it is, and neither do you. Which makes it weird that you want to escalate this a year before the wedding, when there's so much time to still resolve this.\nPublicly uninviting him was certainly not a nice thing to do, but there are better ways to fix this than boycotting the wedding. This is a low level ESH.

But he seems old enough to go. Honestly I\u2019m unsure if you are the asshole or not. I think child free weddings are kind of great so I get why they are having one. But I consider children over 12 able to handle themselves and not run around like crazy people. I think it\u2019s okay to decline the invite but I do not think it\u2019s okay to go off on them.

Mormon wedding ceremonies happen in the temple, and you can't attend if you're not a member, and even if you are a member, you have to have done certain things to qualify to be able to go into that part of the temple. Like, you can go in one part once you're twelve, but you can't go into the main part where weddings happen until you do the endowment, which most people do around the time they're 18 (I never did do it, because I was dealing with doubts, and felt like I should get rid of them before I did the endowment.... spoilers, I never did). \n\nAnd besides that, from what I've heard, the ceremony room is often pretty small, so you only really have room for like, your top ten most important people.\n\nPoint of all of that, is that in Mormon culture, the reception kinda *is* the wedding for most people, and is treated accordingly. The ceremony is kinda a non factor, unless the couple has enough important non members in their life that they decide to have a second, non temple ceremony after the temple one.

And I know I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for using this to vent, but childfree weddings are freaking DUMB. Weddings are celebrations of families coming together, and excluding children from them is ridiculously insane. I've been to a ton of weddings, all of them with kids of all ages, and none of them have EVER \"ruined\" a wedding. If you think a baby crying or a toddler running around foolishly is going to ruin your big day, you're full of yourself to the point of narcissism. Get over it.\n\nWhat's next, no kids allowed to your family gettogether for your birthday? No kids allowed when you host your family Christmas? Ridiculous.", "NTA. You're right that this is definitely a different situation from the rest of the stories about this on here. They absolutely could have handled it better. And expecting parents to readily go to this wedding and find someone to watch their kid is unreasonable. If they can, great, if they can't they can't. They sent two tickets. Whether by accident or not, it sent a lot of confusion. And while they can say childfree means under 18, that's not the case. Many people who have child free weddings mean kids under 15 because they don't want screaming toddlers and kids getting bored and rowdy. I've also seen weddings where it meant no one under 21. But the age was always specified. \n\nThis was a confusion caused by them by sending two tictickets and not specifying that they meant no one under 18. It's a confusion caused by them not paying attention to what they were sending out. And as everyone knows when you send out invitations, you have to be really careful about them. \n\nAs for the uninvited, there's a better way to go about it. They could have taken the both of you aside and been like \"hey, we're so sorry. We meant no one under 18 and the second ticket was a slip of the mind since we sent two tickets to everyone.\" They could have been gentle and quiet about it instead of humiliating your child in front of people. \n\nYou not wanting to go is valid and fine and the fact they're being a holes about it just shows their true colors tbh. Your son will remember this moment for the rest of his life. He'll remember the confusion caused by a lack of consideration, he'll remember the public humiliation. He'll remember how upset they got over this incident at you and will likely blame himself, they created these moments for him. If I was a mother, I definitely wouldn't go.

What if you had the showed up with tickets?", "If the invite letter didn't define child... That's on them. Child stops at like... 13 at the oldest. The idea behind child free is keeping the hyper 7 year old from squirming and the baby from crying during the ceremony. If they wanted a minor free wedding they need to make that clear. You can't be the only person confused unless they don't know anybody else with adolescent kids.", "Exactly. Childfree wedding is not a thing in my culture, only saw it on reddit but I can understand not wanting young children there who can be loud/disruptive. But no one can tell me it's okay or, as OP said, \"not personal\" to exclude your 16 year old nephew, especially when you're close.  NTA", "Why would OP be the AH even if no names were call? They have the right to set stipulations just as OP has the right to decline. Name calling would make OP an AH in front of her child if she decides to attend.", "Who asks for RSVPs a YEAR in advance?!?", "A +1, especially for close family, is pretty standard for invitations to most events.", "Can you not ignore that they\u2019re calling her a bitch and stuff in your next comment please and thank you", "Those other events are so different from a wedding it's baffling to me you'd even compare them. \n\nSometimes an age limit is just to cut the guest list - you want to be fair, so you say 'I'll cut it at 18, or 21, or whatever\" and that way no one feels like they're being *personally* left out. Sometimes it really is just about how much everyone will be drinking (which is typically much more at a wedding that a baby shower, lol). \n\nThere's a number of reasons you might cut teens out. I feel like everyone in this thread who's upset about it is barely out of their teen years and doesn't like the idea they would recently have been excluded in this scenario,", "It's always infuriating and vaguely hilarious when people like that *miss why an entire plot point is important context* just so they can spew their bullshit. It's literally the entire reason for the  mix up with the extra ticket, yet somehow this idiot decided OP mentioned it because she wants a cookie or something.", "He will most definitely not have more fun.  In other post's OP has states that her son is very close to his uncle.  Having kids who idolize their uncles I can understand how a kid would be completely crushed not being invited to his uncles wedding.  Way to lose your cool uncle status.", "Yes!  I said to my husband \u201cI feel like I\u2019m reading a wedding fanfic\u201d, so he asked me to read it to him\u2026and he blinked and said \u201cnooo she wrote a movie script\u201d.", "Normally I would agree, but she already had some key people back out, so I was being tactful. Plus my excuse itself wasn\u2019t an outright lie, it was just a half-truth. It was the gentle wording that I had to craft so as to not stress her further.", "That\u2019s burning a bridge and unnecessary. To close to home. No reason to drag it out. Life is too short.", "I can tell from the initial pics, but it shockingly looks like she got a good crowd that attended.", "I feel like I need to clarify that statement... I don't think she said anything to him directly. I know she was one of the ones who tried to keep in touch with him for a while and he continued to blow her off. But whenever she got frustrated with him, she always came back to THIS issue. \n\nBut I JUST now realized something though that I had never really thought of. Part of the problem was that he was all set to go, then at the last minute she postponed the wedding a year and he had lost his job, but I realize he was likely in mourning because that was the same year his mom, our grandma died.\n\nI'm honestly really frustrated with her at the moment due to her now acting like my uncle. It's become increasingly clear that despite being raised entirely by our mother, empathy isn't her strong suit.", "She is... really bitter. But there's a little more to it than that.\n\nOur mom had died the same way a few years earlier. Thing is, my orphan cousin had just had his sister OD a few months earlier and their mom died the same way when they were little... so it's like we were all a little desensitized? There also really isn't a TV show where this happens so you don't have a script to follow.\n\nBut when Uncle P died, the issue WHY it happened was unavoidable. Although he was beloved by absolutely everyone (no idea how you manage this as an alcoholic, but he did) he shut out literally everyone's attempts to help him for the last... 20 years of his life? We all knew it was gonna happen, including my mom.\n\nWith my mom, the issue was my dad (a sporadic alcoholic) actively encouraged her, let her die, and stole/threw away all her stuff. My sister doesn't have a relationship with him... hence why he wasn't even considered walking down the aisle (my younger sister, on the other hand, thinks he can do no wrong.)\n\nYay, family! Or something.", "My sister has actually never met her bio-father (though my mom was sure to remind everyone she was married to him and she wasn't ONE OF THOOOOSE girls) and though my dad was there, she made a point not to consider him. I wrote a little more about my family structure in another one of the comments.", "Wow, I've never been called a bitch by one of my siblings, lol. That's different. I have 5 brothers though, haha", "I like that. I'm completely against any names that compare women to female animals.\n\nBitch, nag, cow, pig, vixen, fox, chick, hen, etc.", "me too. My sibs are my best friends", "Great list, and I'd add the women who want to wear nice suits or pants to the list. We see them a lot. And also people who aren't allowed to bring their same sex or trans partner or child. I'll stand with you and all of these people.", "They didn\u2019t really ask anything though. She said her son started talking about going to the wedding because there were two tickets", "Also from what I've gleaned from the comments, OP's some will be 17 by then AND the groom and OP's son are only 7 years apart in age so he's almost like an older brother. That combined with the initial two tickets... I don't understand why he wouldn't be invited even with the child-free rule. I'd say skip the wedding and do something special with her son that day for sure.", "Exactly. The poor kid was publicly humiliated by his father figure and family. I can understand wanting to stick hard and fast to your rules \u2014 it\u2019s your wedding \u2014 but that conversation could\u2019ve been had in private and with care towards his feelings. If this had been spun differently, maybe he would\u2019ve even enjoyed having a few days to himself without mom. Not to even mention the treatment of mom when she backed out\u2026", "I have a 21 year old. At 16 she was starting to feel more grown up. We were talking to her like an adult and giving her more freedoms and responsibilities. For OP\u2019s son this was a blow to his ego to remind him that, no, he\u2019s still just a kid. It would have really hurt my daughters feelings/ego to be lumped in with kids when at 16 they can handle themselves well, especially at a family event.", "That's what I'm thinking. It may not be THE Issue but it is AN issue and I'm sure is a big reason why op isn't attending.", "This is why I would have second thoughts leaving a 16/17 year old unsupervised for more than a day or two. But again depends on the kid, I\u2019ve known 16/17 year olds who are more responsible than a lot of adults, I\u2019ve also known kids that age who I wouldn\u2019t leave unsupervised for more than a few hours. I\u2019ve seen a home absolutely trashed because the parents went away and it was an almost 20 year old who threw the party, being irresponsible isn\u2019t limited to teens.", "This exactly is the point. Where do you draw the line?? My parents have huge family. I invited ALL of their siblings and their spouses. But my dad is the youngest, that means I have cousins with children. I did not invite most of my cousins on dads side. I\u2019m just not close enough to them to care to seek them at the wedding and I just invited the aunts and uncles as a sign of respect of my father.", "If it's US, 21 is legal drinking age. Based on her spelling, and the insults she's claimed, I'm being she's US.", "I\u2019m curious if it did say & guest, why would sil and brother be alright with a random plus one at their wedding but not their own nephew who will be one year shy of being a legal adult?", "Yeah I posted in another comment that if you're old enough to get a license to drive a car but not be a child at a wedding... esp a very close relative... it's just whack.", "Exactly-- I'm 17, so similar in age to OP's son, and if someone invited my family to an \"adults only\" wedding I would understand that doesn't include me. If it said \"child-free,\" I would assume I am invited, because usually when people say child-free they mean no one under \\~12 or 13 in my experience.", "\"Well if you don't want kids, you definitely don't want a bitch like me to be there\"", "Geez. NTA. Avoid them all. If they pull \"but faaaamily\" card, remind them that you are prioritizing the most important member of your family: your son.", "You're all clear to decline.  Just tell them they shouldn't want a \"bitch\" at the wedding anyway.", "Omg absolutely do not go. They called you names? They are the ones that made the mistake of sending two tickets. They also did not specify an age limit of anything. Do not go, do not send a gift.", "They aren't entitled to your presence at their wedding. If they are abusive to you, it should be clear to everyone that feelings are too negative on both sides for you to even consider it.", "This, I\u2019ve seen people sending out \u201ctickets\u201d if they have a music theme or something like that. It\u2019s just a design.", "Because 1) the wedding is in a year. What if she finds a +1 in the meantime? Or 2) perhaps they were mailing out several dozen and almost everyone was getting two, so it was a mistake that went unnoticed. Like when someone puts 11 nuggets in your 10-piece meal. \n\nPlease don't assign maliciousness to what may simply be human error.", "Exactly?   A year before the event no less?   Self important much?", "Movie tickets, carnival tickets. They're not real tickets. They're just a design choice to show how many people are included in your invitation.", "Y\u2019all I understand ALL your reasons for a child free wedding. None of those reasons should apply to your SIBLINGS TEENAGE CHILD! That is INSANE TO ME. \n\nYou\u2019d rather have some HS/College/work friend there you probably talk to occasionally than your niece or nephew?! Apply the age limit to non siblings. So if your sibling is under the age limit they can\u2019t come either?!", "So they both have a close relationship with your son but they didn\u2019t think that he would be hurt by not being allowed to attend their wedding? That\u2019s cold", "Seems like communication is the key here. Your son should feel empowered to tell his uncle how he feels about the way this all went down. Families do step on each other\u2019s feelings occasionally & communication is a good start to resolving problems. If your son is not comfortable speaking with his uncle then you need to help him but try not to speak for him. \n\nI truly understand Mama bear reactions & wanting to protect your kid but I also know that my kids (now 25,25,27,29) did not always appreciate our interfering with & trying to fix their problems. They need to feel some control because it\u2019s happening to them. Your son is the one being disappointed & excluded. He has his own relationship with his uncle & he should feel like he has the power to voice his concerns & be part of the solution to their problems.\n\nI really do empathize with you feeling hurt for your son & wanting to hurt the people who hurt him but just try to remember this is really about your son. He should feel like his Mom is willing to help him & allow him to have some control of how this problem is resolved. Whether or not you attend your brother\u2019s wedding has no effect on your son\u2019s issue with his uncle.\n\neta \u2014 imo this all seems like one big miscommunication. With assumptions made & reactions not handled well.", "It's already damaged. Your son won't forget this. He was humiliated. No 16 year old, who will he 17 at the time of said event, views themselves as a \"child\" even if legally they are not an adult yet.  He thought his uncle and aunt valued him enough to want to include him in their special day. He thought they were close, and would want him at their wedding. They told him to his face in front of other people that he was just a kid and wasn't wanted. I'm sure that's not the words they used, but guarantee that's the message your son received. That's something a person doesn't forget. Their relationship will never be the same. If he finds out they have been insulting his mother about it on top of everything, that will probably just be the final nail in the coffin of that relationship.", "It\u2019s already been damaged. Too late now", "> I hope their relationship does not get damaged over a ticket.\n\npeople saying \"the relationship is damaged it's too late\" are being a little too pessimistic imo and it's extremely unhelpful and damaging in itself. \n\nEverything gets damaged, literally everything. This isn't an end all or a fork in the road in which the relationship changes for the negative forever. You have until 2024 to think and speak about this amongst yourselves. I believe ya'll will be okay if you want to be. Communication is clearly key here, as lack of it has created this rift. It is mendable, just let your feelings be known and don't let this fester and then dissolve into your relationships together, poisoning them. Family (and friend) relationships can become so senselessly poisoned - do not let it happen - it sounds like your son and your brother needed and will continue to need each other on an emotionally comforting level. Please just talk to each other when you feel comfortable enough. Don't let this be the thing that sparks a divide. \n\nDon't stop validating your sons feelings. It's comforting to hear you both confided in each other about this. Keep that connection.", "Yeah, that's what I got from it.\n\nWas very confused by the notion of \"They said it was child-free. So anyway, I assumed my 16-year-old son could come\"... Thought I misread something, haha.", "would love to read that!", "Were they hired extras for her 'movie'? She could have grabbed a bunch of film students....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA OP", "Yeah, everyone has an asshole. And everyone can be one.", "It would be one thing if it was OPs friend from college who has visited occasionally but mostly interacted with OP via social media/phone calls/texts who was having a child free wedding.  I could see OP's kid being whatevs, I don't know them anyway.  \n\nThis will likely permanently impact OP's relationship with her brother and her son's relationship with his uncle.  I hope it was worth it to them", "Oh good, I can go. The only time being an orphan comes in handy!", "It was just not a very good joke? Not even dad material.", "Not accounting countries where you can drink underage if a legal guardian is present.", "Haha I got a British vibe!", "Yeah...that's totally different though.  Yours is the \"exception\" to that rule cause those tickets weren't just for the wedding but they were also for an entrance fee to the venue.  What you did was a GOOD host thing, you didn't expect your guests to cover that fee (which sounds kinda ridiculous itself, but people do destination weddings all the time).", "And brother didn't just uninvite his nephew.  He did it so publicly, which I'm very sure embarrassed the son. I can't see the relationship recovering from such blatant mistreatment.", "I agree. Even though her brother and SIL have a right to have the wedding the way they want. I think her brother acted cruelly and selfishly. There are consequences to all of our actions. Regardless of if they are right or wrong. Her son definitely shouldn\u2019t be told to just grin and bare it. He absolutely has a right to feel hurt. Op should talk to her son and find out how he is feeling about the situation and also let brother know. Not in a nasty way but just so he is aware of the rift he caused.", "It's up to the brother if this is what sparks a divide. Not OP and her son. This mess is on him, not them. And he is also the only one who can fix it, by apologizing, which isn't exactly what he is doing.", "Right.  I don't even get the idea that \"they made it clear that was child free, but when I had a plus one, I assumed that must be for my child\"", "I got so curious from your comment. Just spent the last half an hour learning about the age of majority and the age of license and honestly I don't know what to think anymore \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d\n\nDid you know Yemen, Iran and Indonesia (apparently- I'm getting my knowledge from wiki so pls correct me if I'm wrong) have an age majority of up to 15 y/o?! That's crazy to me!\n\nHowever ages of majority/license are then different from ages of: maturity/sexual consent/marriageable age/school leaving/drinking/driving/voting/smoking/gambling.\n\nI now have too much knowledge and not enough to even comprehend. Thanks for listening to my rant!", "i feel like they didn\u2019t \u201cuninvite him\u201d though since the letter wasn\u2019t addressed to him and he wasn\u2019t invited in the first place. he just assumed he was."]}
