There's my older brother Mike (34m), older sister Ava (31f), me (29f), younger sister Jessie (27f) and younger brother Luke (25m). I have always felt like a bit of an outsider in my family. I'm always invited to stuff but not always included. They never really tell me anything or come to me about stuff they are dealing with. I have tried to be there over the years for them but get shut out somewhat. Like they will say nothing is wrong to me but then confide in the other siblings/our parents and I am usually left to find out last. Things like I was the last one to find out Ava's childhood friend was sick even though I was the first to notice something was wrong and reached out to Ava, or the fact I found out with the extended family that Luke was graduating top of his class even though I always asked how he was doing, etc, or the fact I found out Mike was engaged on FB when he called our parents and siblings to tell them personally. \n\nThey have always made an effort to know what each other likes too but never what I like and I made the effort to learn their likes and dislikes too. It's the kind of thing where I just had to accept that it was our relationship and I put my time into focusing on other relationships like with my husband, with my ILs who treat me like one of their own, and with friends who seem to give a shit about me. I'm kind of used to being overlooked by my family so it just was what it was. I have brought it up to them before but they would overlook it each and every time.

They told me I was prioritizing ILs and friends above family and that I was creating the distance.

I wish you a safe and happy journey all the way through to your delivery.\n\nYou\u2019ve been dealing with this your whole life, and during that dinner you finally stood up for yourself. If not anybody else, I\u2019m proud of you for it. You\u2019ve been expressing to your family for years how you have felt left out etc. From what I\u2019ve read in the post, they haven\u2019t tried one bit to make you feel more comfortable and accepted.\n\nIf your ILs have treated you exceptionally from day one, and your own family has not..then that isn\u2019t your fault for letting them know such an important part of your life first.\n\nIm sorry for what you\u2019ve had to deal with your own family, but on the bright side, you have ILs that accept and love you for whom you are. Time for a new start at what you deserve. Much love. And again, NTA.", "NTA. I don\u2019t believe you are imagining the \u201coutsider\u201d stuff. It\u2019s the same for me in my family-I am always an afterthought. You are doing the right thing investing in relationships with people who care about you e.g. your inlaws and friends. I would continue to keep your family at arms length. If you invest further in that relationship you will only get hurt. Just brush off their delusional remarks and move on. The only other thing I would say is that as a person in a similar position, I used to do a lot of soul searching to try to understand why I was not a priority for my family-but now I realise that it isn\u2018t anything inherent about me-family dynamics are inexplicable and there is no use trying to make sense of them. So don\u2019t let it affect your self confidence.", "NTA. You made the adult decision to remove yourself from an argument. The audacity of demanding to know why you told your IL first. *They're your family too. They will be the child's grandparents/family too.* Why should your parents have priority over your husband's? \n\nIf I may, a suggestion. You need to decide whether you think your family's treatment of you would extend to your children. Do you want your children asking why your parents care more about their cousins? Sit down with your parents without your siblings. Ask to not be interrupted, explain that you aren't there to argue, tell them that whether or not they meant it you *feel* like you're no one's priority. Explain that your ILs know everything about you, your likes and dislikes, things your family who has known you your whole life don't know because they never remembered. That made you realise just how hurt you feel when you compare your relationships. And when you told them your wonderful news all they cared about was that *they weren't the first to find out*, and ruined the family moment you were trying to share with them. Give them time to think and respond, maybe a few days, and let that response be your guide moving forward. \n\nThey will be defensive straight away (this is why it's important to focus on your own feelings, they can't accuse you of attacking them). If they remain defensive and refuse to even consider your point of view then you have your answer.\n\nCongratulations on the baby and best of luck moving forwards!", "> They said I should have stayed and discussed it like adults.\n\nThat's code for \"You should have stayed and been harangued until you were beaten down enough to agree with us\".\n\nDon't do it.\n\nYou started well by walking out. Keep (metaphorically) walking until you are no longer within the influence of these people, who have made you feel less than for your entire life.\n\nKeep walking until you are surrounded, supported and insulated by people who see you, value you and include you. Those are your real family. Your relatives are simply genetic happenstance.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nWow, the entitlement.\n\nYou're right to expect better.\n\nSuggestion: write them an open letter detailing all the times they've excluded you throughout the years; if they expect to be kept in the loop going forward, it's incumbent on them to start treating you like you are part of the family.", "NTA\n\nI would double down if I were you, after the child is born, I would let them know on FB like everybody else.\n\nThey say you are exaggerating and acting like a child when you made valid points? they think you are gullible enough to be pursuaded, do what you like but honestly I would limit contact with them for a while.", "NTA - that's a classic abuse tactic, the old \"tell them they're immature unless they let us berate them with toxicity until they're a shell of themselves who only does what we want them to.\"", "NTA, I have the same relationship with my siblings.\nI realized I was the one always trying to get everyone together, so I totally stopped reaching out to plan anything to see if they ever tried\u2026.and they rarely if ever did. I had to accept that I was and always be the \u2018outsider\u2019.\n\nIt does hurt, but I also some relief of always trying to prove myself or justifying myself (we are very different on many aspects of life) to them.\n\nI do still see them/contact-especially when they need me to watch my nieces/nephews.", "NTA\n\nYou have been trying to discuss it like an adult even before you were an adult.  What are they even talking about? \n\nI\u2019m an only child so this invisible child dynamic is so strange to me. I\u2019m mystified how it\u2019s even possible. How do people ignore their child or sibling like this? It\u2019s like Twilight Zone kind of weird to me. You\u2019re literally right there telling them stuff and it blows right past them.  They clearly hear, but do not listen. \n\nAlso they\u2019re weird for focusing so hard on who told what to whom first that they are blowing right past your happy news.  Serious pod people behavior there. (Reference to Invasion of the Body Snatchers). \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy. I wish you and your child and husband health and happiness!", "NTA. Before anything, I want to emphasize this. You are your own person, with your own man, your own house, and (hopefully soon) your own kid. You are completely allowed to walk out of whatever conversation or argument you want. Legally, nothing wrong with that. Societally, nothing wrong with that. Relationally, surprisingly, NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.  \n\n\nThis is actually something that shows maturity. Are you or the opposition getting heated? Walk away. That's to be expected. That's to be encouraged. If this fight was a fight worth having, it should still be worth having a week later when everyone has calmed down.   \n\n\nAs for going forward, think about your relationship with your family. How much do you value it? Is it really worth it to expend more energy with this specific relationship? My recommended course of action would be to send them a message and explain why you did your actions, and firmly assert what you want out of them moving forwards, namely \"more interaction and more care between both of us\". Make sure to underline the consequences that will happen, should they choose not to follow your wishes.  \n\n\nSo to sum it up, you are not the asshole, you're an independent person who chose the more mature route.", "NTA you have been over looked by them for you entire life and they were creating distance between you and them. then they say your creating distance.\n\nthey sound like a bunch of hypocrites and you sound like your better off without them.", "NTA if they wanted to have leading roles in your life they shouldn\u2019t have cast you as a walkthrough in theirs.", "NTA\n\nAs a fellow outsider, damned if you and damned if you don\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nYou expressed your feelings, which are completely valid. They then shit all over them and said you\u2019re in the wrong. That\u2019s not an adult discussion at all. That\u2019s a shit show.\n\nProtect yourself now.

I'd rather tell my uncles (his brothers) before because I'm closer to them. \n\nYour ILs are your family too. They are going to be one set of future grandparents to your baby. They have always supported you. They deserve to be told as one of the first. And friends can be equally important if they were the ones who were there for you.

They ain't worth the pain and upset they are causing. Also do you really want to have people like that who clearly never gave a damn about you in your child's life?", "NTA.

I too married into a loving, accepting family; I am so glad that you've been welcomed with open arms by your husband's family. You owe your family of origin nothing. Maybe politeness, but that's it. I recommend spending less and less time with them and more time with the people who actually love and care about you.", "NTA.

It is sadly not uncommon for dysfunctional parents to pick a child as a target and then bond with the other children (and get them to bond with each other) based on being insiders excluding the outsider.

Read up everything you can about golden children and scapegoats in the family dynamic. And then google the term \"drop the rope\".\n\nThat's what you need to do here. Your family is used to, and very comfortable,  with a dynamic where you are constantly the one bearing the emotional labor of the relationships with each if them. They EXPECT you will maintain this power imbalance, seeing their live, their approval, their inclusion... and that you will be the one always doing the reaching out, always building the bridge, and be happy with the scraps  that fall from the banquet they feast on.\n\nYou're not some beggar. You've found that with your ILs and friends, relationships are healthier,  have reciprocity, you aren't talked down to, demeaned, or expected to treat them better than they treat you.

You weren't being a child, you were pregnant, sharing happy news, and you got a shitstorm of nasty egos and negative energy, and then they really went over the top when you called their own faults out to their faces... you did exactly the right thing leaving. The stress is not good for the baby. Scapegoats are usually the Truth Tellers of the family anyways.

And you and your baby deserve better than that. But I don't think that this will be the end of it. I can see you at your baby shower and your family start feeling some type of way or resentment about the way you interact with in-laws and friends versus how you interact with your family.

The last incident was in 2017 when my dad's wife (stepmom) got into a car accident when heading home from work. Dad found out he called big brother they rushed to the hospital to check on her.

You've given enough into their void of empathy.", "OP, congratulations on your baby! \n\nSo much good stuff has been said already. I might just be restating things, but here is what I've got. \n\nMy situation doesn't come from being a middle child, but I very much understand being forgotten, excluded, and disregarded. \n\nIt has taken me 50+ years to figure out that my family's anger and denial were all about selfishness. If I said, \"you hurt me by leaving me out,\" they easily could have responded with love, apologized, and asked how we could make things better. They could have.\n\nWhat almost always has happened is they get mad, deny wrongdoing, and tell me I'm too sensitive. I thought for the longest time I was losing my mind if all of the felt that way. I wasn't losing my mind, but they didn't mind if I believed that so they wouldn't have to look at themselves. \n\nExample: I haven't thought of this in years, but it came to me while writing this. Here in Texas, we like football a little bit. I was out of high school, but my best friend who is two years younger than me was in band and so I went to the game to see her march at halftime and to see our team get beat by our rivals. I was on the walkway of the bleachers when I heard somebody calling my name. It took me a minute to realize the person who wanted my attention was down on the track between me and the field. Positioning matters because we had to talk loud to be heard and afterwards I felt shocked and humiliated that I looked like a fool in front of all the people around us.\n\nSo the guy calling my name - let's call him Nash - was a year younger than me but friends with my brother \"Mack\", a  year older than me. Nash asks me how Mack is doing. I told him I guessed he was fine. Nash looked at me a bit funny and asked how Mack's head was. I have several opinions about Mack's head, but I figured that was not what Nash was asking, so I asked him to explain the question better.\n\nThe story from Nash had taken place 2 weeks prior. Turns out Mack, who was attending one of the larger Texas universities, had driven across the state with some friends to one of the biggest Texas universities to attend a football game. They were staying at the apartment of a high school friend. That Saturday night after the game, some drunk guy who was at the same apartment complex decided that Mack was the guy he had wanted to beat up earlier. How embarrassing for the drunk guy that he didn't find out that Mack was the wrong guy until Mack was in an ambulance with a concussion and some bruises. (Sadly, I'm sure this type of scenario plays out all across Texas even all these years later.)\n\nSo there was no way that I could hide from Nash or anyone else around us that I had not  heard any of this story before. Nash actually looked a bit sad because of it. He had been the one to call my folks when it happened - you know, the mother and father who I still lived with while attending the local junior college. I asked Mom about it the next day and she says she just forgot to tell me. Mack found out about Nash telling me and Mack was just worried that I might have said something to Nash that would embarrass Mack. Me? Say something to embarrass you, Mack? Not unless you count Nash and a bunch of people from our hometown figuring out that you had probably said more words to that drunk Aggie that was trying to kill you than you had said to me in years. \n\nAnd there it is, OP. My brother (and the rest of my family) cared what people thought. We went to an evangelical church and it mattered if people thought you were good. When I told my family that they hurt me, I was risking them looking like a bad family members. I was challenging who they thought they were. They cared very little about who I was. Not much I could do about that.\n\nIf you find a way to change selfishness, please let me know. I'll buy several copies of the book you write on it and send them to my family.\n\nTake care now.", "Ummm.... I'm pretty sure ILs are family.

I\u2019m going to guess you probably low key accidentally call out their shallowness all the time just by existing around them. It\u2019s not on purpose! It just happens because you\u2019re a more decent person. \n\nAnyway. \n\nI think you should get a practice going, especially while you\u2019re pregnant. Maybe a daily walk + meditation, pregnancy yoga, breathing meditation, gardening, volunteering- something physical that takes focus and brings you into flow state. This is a great time to shrug off your family\u2019s years of poor treatment and find a place of neutrality around the pain they have caused you. \n\nEMDR therapy is short term and works great.
