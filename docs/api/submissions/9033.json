I also have a part time job in my field but when I complete my after degree  my employer will take me on full time.  I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.  \n\nBoth of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.  \n\nMy dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.  \n\nOver Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.  \n\nMy parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.  \n\nI went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.  \n\nI packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.  \n\nI'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.  \n\nI just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.  \n\nMy oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.  \n\nMy parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.  \n\nI'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.    \n\nI feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.\n\n#EDIT\n\nAll the chores were split fairly.

I bet your oldest brother is regretting making such a fuss about you buying yourself a PS5 with your own money. He started all of this.   \n\n\nI know that all parents are different and have different plans on how they can or want to support their children.  Some start rent right at 18 or high school graduation, some pay for all expenses through college.  Many of us are somewhere in between.   \n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t should like your parents told you in advance that rent would start at a certain age, which I think is unfair. It sounds more like they just wanted to confiscate part of your income so your siblings wouldn\u2019t be as jealous. When they introduced the idea of rent, I would have introduced the concept of decreased chores.  Someone renting a room would traditionally not have assigned chores and childcare, they would just tidy up after themselves.   \n\n\nParents often initiate conversations about rent to inspire young adult (or older) offspring to move out.  Even when that wasn\u2019t the parents\u2019 intent, the rent talk often inspires the offspring to do a cost/benefit analysis and decide to move out. That\u2019s what happened here.

However, the way they framed it made it sound like they expected this of you as a condition of \"fairness\" for your other siblings, simply because you are spending your hard-earned money on things you love. \n\nYou could serve as a role model to them. Parents could say, \"we know it's hard to see people get things you want, but (OP) works for that. You can be like that too someday when it's your time.\" It would be one thing if your parents were buying these things for you, but they're not. \n\nMore than that, you didn't agree to their terms of continued living with them. So, instead of throwing a tantrum, you packed up and moved out. I don't think that is unreasonable at all.

You family will probably come around in time.  Your parents will be in for a rude awakening when your brother does the same thing.  Live your life!!", "NTA. You said in an edit chores were split fairly but you were a full time student with a part time job-- that's MORE than full time work-- and your parents had normal hour full time jobs they've presumably had a long time to figure out balancing work and house stuff with. So you taking over most of the household management doesn't make a lot of sense. They basically had you as a free housekeeper and then wanted you to also pay. \n\nI'm the oldest of seven. I had a lot of responsibility young because of a parent's illness and my dad working a lot of overtime. I did some of this household management stuff as a teen and I didn't mind it-- my family needed it, my mom hadn't planned to get very ill. I even took a gap year to help while my mom was recovering. But when I started college, I moved out, and nobody gave me grief about it-- nobody in the family accused me of abandoning them because that is a NORMAL transition in life. If she had relapsed I would have taken a semester or two off because that would be extenuating circumstances, but normal jobs are NOT.

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask an adult to pay rent, but you found a different situation that works much better for you! I don't think your family being upset that you left rises to the level of AH (it's understandable they would miss you, though the specific complaints you mentioned are all transactional and veering them in the direction of AH if that's really all they care about) unless they start punishing you in some way for growing up and living your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, moving out and becoming independent in your 20s is a normal expectation, so OP is NTA", "You living there at the age of 18 or 19 or heck even 20 has no cost increase from you living there at 17.\n\nI hate the idea that as soon as you hit 18 or graduate high school/primary school you are suddenly an adult who has to live a certain way.\n\nLike, yeah, don't mooch. But parents are supposed to support their kids. Wasn't the kid's choice to be born, no matter how old they get.", "When I was living with my parents and working, I paid for my own car (as I had since 16), clothes (as I had since I got a part time job at 13), toiletries (since 16), phone (that one started at 17 when I graduated High School.. although I did pay for it initially when I got it after I started work but they started paying when they decided to get my little brother a phone, too). I NEVER paid my parents rent. \n\nAs I said to them, if I was going to be paying to live somewhere I was NOT going to be paying to live with my parents. I did say if it made them feel better I could give them money for them to put in a savings for me to use once I did move out, but I was NOT going to be paying them rent.", "If I'm paying any amount of money to live in a space, I better be respected and protected as a tenant.", "I think that\u2019s fine. If they are working and saving. \n\nReally it comes down to what is best for them. As parents we want to raise self sufficient adults. We want them to br able to succeed etc. they can live at home and develop those skills, save for the future and have a leg up. But if they\u2019re just at home playing video games all day\u2026 or whatever\u2026 not so much.", "It's still one of those things where it's not an asshole move. If they're being told they're a burden they can relieve the burden by moving out. There's nothing wrong with parents asking an adult child for rent, but there's nothing wrong with that child deciding they'd rather move out. Living with your parents is hard in a lot of ways. Sharing space with people always is, but managing that changing power dynamic every day is difficult. The only asshole response an adult child can have in this situation is to refuse to pay or move out.", "What 'extra expenses' would there be for a 23 year old over an 18 year old?  None that I can think of.", "> when your an adult you obviously bring extra expenses to a household and if it was an 'I'm expected so contribute so I'm guna leave' \n\nGiven that leaving removes the extra expenses, it's still not an issue.  People are allowed to move out.", "How are you gonna argue with someone who believes they were doing their fair share lmao.", "Exactly this", "On top of study and work. OP deserves her freedom.", "No, sounds like he was the one complaining and getting the parents all worked up", "Unfortunately OP has indicated in other comments that the parents left the entirety of managing the house, yardwork, etc to the children. *All* the parents did was \"bring home the bacon\", leaving everything else to OP and the others.", "I thought it said \"23 m\"", "I don't really get the \"older sister vibes\", there's nothing gendered in the post that I saw. Just a story about an older sibling who moved out and bought a plant from ikea.", "> I'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder. I couldn't have women over to my parents house. \n\nThat's why I thought it was a man", "I leaned brother too after the PS5/having women over comment. Statistically more likely a guy i\u2019d think (and in this case was wrong)", "never had an older sister, never was one myself, so how does is it blindingly obvious that this is written by a woman?", "Meal prepping for 7 people, even if only for lunch for the kids (3 humans) and making dinner and doing laundry for a 7 person household is way to much for one kid, even an adult one.", "OP\u2019s parents could be conservative, which is why OP was so crucial to the running of the house as the oldest daughter in a housekeeper and maid role. Conservative is also consistent with being expected to respect family even when family doesn\u2019t respect you.", "My pup's name is Champ and he's adorable everytime I see Champ I think of him. I love him so much", "My IKEA actually has some very nice live plants. We\u2019ve considered getting some for our front porch in the summers but still have to find a safe winter place for them.", "The garden will be smaller. The trips to the supermarket cheaper and less frequent. Smaller, easier to cook dinners with less cleaning.\n\nIt's much easier to just clean up after yourself than cleaning up after 7 people.", "I still love it\u263a\ufe0f", "This seems like a lovely balance and fab parenting .. go you!", "That\u2019s how it was with my parents as well, and it worked great.", "My parents did the same for my brother and I. I think its a great system!", "No it doesn't but the obligation to 'look after you' certainly diminishes when you are an adult with options to get a job etc I'm not a supporter of kicking out your child on their 18th birthday but at 23 I also wouldn't have expected my parents to completely financially support me, I just think it takes mutual respect and appreciation on both sides ..\n\nSo exactly kids don't mooch but also remember your a parent for the entirety of their lives not just 18 years", "Parents are responsible for supporting their kids until the age of 18.  They are most certainly not responsible after that.  Anything your parents help you with after she 18, is a gift and not an entitlement", "Again I agree with that I'm more on about the attitude of 'well your my parents so i shouldnt pay'.\n\nAs an adult you can absolutely choose to move out and not be an AH but I think the (hypothetical) motivation of spite purely because their your parents would make you an AH. The reason I said this is because that's the only details thw title gives, but as a said that clearly isn't the case here", "And? Why the comparison with someone who is 18? \n\nIf you actually read my comments I've already said I don't agree with the turn 18 and be completely thrown in at the deep end attitude but in the 5 years between 18 and 23 you have opportunity to financially establish yourself save up if you want to live independently etc. \n\nI've already said on repeat he is NTA based on his circumstances I just disagree with the view that all adults are automatically allowed to live for free with their parents with no other contributions because then your parents are paying to keep you and you obviously bring cost to the household (not over an 18yo but over not living in their house)", "No one said they weren't, and they even said, that wasn't the case here.", "I'm talking about the motivation not the actual moving out..\n\n- okay well if I'm going to be paying I'd rather be paying to live independently as an adult - absolutely fine\n\n- no I'm going to move out and pay off someone else's mortgage because your my mummy and I should be entitled to live with you for free forever so fuck you - AH \n\nI only said that because that's the only info given in the title", "You're undervaluing what you did, I think.", "OP when you feel like reflect on things, look it up mental and emotional labor; is the pretty much invisible tasks that take a tons of energy without we noticing.", "Good for you sticking up for your siblings like that in the comments \u270a", "You were handling household management which is HUGE. You are why the house ran smoothly and they are now realizing that.", "Look at my comments and see how I did. It\u2019s very easy for children (even adult ones) not to see the ways their parents are screwing up. Family systems are strong and hard to break out of. The fact that she (for now) thinks it was fair doesn\u2019t at all mean it was.", "So basically the 1950's equivalent of the dad working and the wife taking care of the home. Only in this case, it's both parents working, and the kids taking care of the home.", "The feel good movie of the year! NTA", "Not true at all. This may surprise you, but women play video games too.", ">The garden will be smaller.\n\nHow?", "Exactly! It's a process and every young adult will be ready in their own time. Part of parenting is working together with your kids to figure out when that is. Not pushing them out before they are prepared, and not holding them back because you aren't ready to let go.", "That really depends on jurisdiction. In Oregon, for example, a parent can be ordered to pay child support to their adult children up to age 21 provided certain conditions are met.", "Not legally responsible. \n\nDoesn't make you not an AH though.", "A distinction without a difference.", "I don't mean to be pedantic, but I had to keep re-reading some of your sentences because you keep spelling \"you're\" \"your\". You want to spell it \"you're\" in this sentence: *\"no I'm going to move out and pay off someone else's mortgage because* ***your*** *my mummy\"* because it's a shortened version of \"you are\", hence \"you're\". \n\nA little tip: if you're ever unsure of which one to use, say it in your head, if it's supposed to be \"you are\", then it's \"you're\" or just type it as \"you are\".", "I can believe that the chores were split \u201cfairly \u201c between you and your siblings, but if you consider that this is their house and these are their children, I find it hard to believe your parents are doing their share of the work given how much they are offloading on their kids. Chores are good. I have kids, they do chores. They cook sometimes. They do dishes. They do some cleaning. But their upbringing and the maintenance of our house is still primarily my responsibility and their father\u2019s.", "They bring home the bacon.", "Exactly. And when they asked OP to contribute financially while still doing all that household and emotional labour it was the equivalent of a husband who expects his wife to work and still come home and make him dinner and clean up while he watches tv. No wonder OP left.", "As a woman I am shocked. I am allowed to play video games?", "They were talking stats, there are more men than women who are interested in women and same goes for video game consoles. Same way a long haired person is more likely to be a woman.", "I looked it up and it's a 60-40 split, which in theory supports OP's point (statistically more likely to be a guy) but to a far lesser degree than I expected.\n\nedit : I'm fully aware that women play video games, I just figured it was something along the lines of 25-30%.", "You don't need to grow as much fresh produce. 2 people eat much less than 7.", "Except the motivation is very different and this is a thread about morality and what would MORALLY make you an AH.", "I was just typing lazy", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought. Sorry OP, but I don\u2019t think you were treated fairly and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out and enjoying your life. Definitely, definitely NTA", "Lol and they wanted yours too", "So? That doesn\u2019t mean they get to offload everything else onto their kids. \n\nIt might be a surprise, but my single parent mother worked, took care of us, and did 95% of the housework. She would never have dreamed of having us do everything just because she had a job. I mean? They should have jobs. They should also be participating in the household and taking care of chores.", "Yeah but most people have to work (bring home the bacon) and cook and clean up and plan the meals and grocery shop and do it all. Most people don\u2019t have the luxury of outsourcing the domestic labor Ja\u00edr because they\u2019re working", "Apparently not enough bacon", "Yeah that\u2019s not adequate. They\u2019re parents. They chose to have a family. They need to be involved.", "You\u2019ve been tricked. My dad worked 80+ hours a week, mom was a special education teacher. The only chores I had to do were specific to me. My own laundry, clean me room. Once in a blue moon mow the lawn or pick the basement up before I had friends over. They did the rest. Your parents sound hella lazy.", "Ah, you think a productive garden. I just thought of the area around the house, that won't shrink.", "This also make very understandable the other siblings reaction. They probably are finding difficult to do everything because it was already too much and now it's one person less and even more housework to do without/bare minimum parents contribution.\n\nOP is still NTA obviously. The parents are in the wrong but it's probably too late anyway and it is also difficult for the children to understand that it shouldn't be that way. In a house you shouldn't almost exclusively rely on your children to maintain it, the primary care of those should be on the parents.", "It\u2019s just means they couldn\u2019t actually afford the kids they have. Older kids are not for raising younger ones. If you can\u2019t work and take vacate of your kids you can\u2019t afford to have them.", "also am I understanding right that OP wasn't ever allowed to have girls over but his younger brother was allowed to have his gf over if the parents are home? if so, that's such oldest child hypocrisy bullshit. you have to set an example for the younger kids even while the younger kids are doing normal shady adolescent shit.", "You're referring to the lawn or yard. Just dryscape that and you'll never have to worry about it again.", "It sucks for the other kids, definitely. And understandable though wrong that they blame OP. It\u2019s hard for kids to see the bad actions of their parents clearly", "> and now it's one person less and even more housework to do\n\nThis will continue to get worse as more siblings leave.  The next oldest is 20, how much longer will he be in the house?\n\nThe parents need to find a solution before the 20-yo moves out.", "I think this might be regional. Like, in America, the garden is the place where we grow our veggies and whatnot. I'm pretty sure in England the garden is the grassy bit out back?", "And that solution is not have another baby."]}
