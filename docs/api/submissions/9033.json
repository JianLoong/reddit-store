My siblings range from 20-10.  \n\nBoth of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.  \n\nMy dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.  \n\nOver Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.  \n\nMy parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.  \n\nI went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.  \n\nI packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.  \n\nI'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.  \n\nI just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.  \n\nMy oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.  \n\nMy parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.  \n\nI'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.    \n\nI feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.\n\n#EDIT\n\nAll the chores were split fairly.

I bet your oldest brother is regretting making such a fuss about you buying yourself a PS5 with your own money. He started all of this.   \n\n\nI know that all parents are different and have different plans on how they can or want to support their children.  Some start rent right at 18 or high school graduation, some pay for all expenses through college.  Many of us are somewhere in between.   \n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t should like your parents told you in advance that rent would start at a certain age, which I think is unfair. It sounds more like they just wanted to confiscate part of your income so your siblings wouldn\u2019t be as jealous. When they introduced the idea of rent, I would have introduced the concept of decreased chores.  Someone renting a room would traditionally not have assigned chores and childcare, they would just tidy up after themselves.   \n\n\nParents often initiate conversations about rent to inspire young adult (or older) offspring to move out.  Even when that wasn\u2019t the parents\u2019 intent, the rent talk often inspires the offspring to do a cost/benefit analysis and decide to move out. That\u2019s what happened here. It certainly doesn\u2019t make you an AH.  \n\nNTA.

However, the way they framed it made it sound like they expected this of you as a condition of \"fairness\" for your other siblings, simply because you are spending your hard-earned money on things you love. \n\nYou could serve as a role model to them. Parents could say, \"we know it's hard to see people get things you want, but (OP) works for that. You can be like that too someday when it's your time.\" It would be one thing if your parents were buying these things for you, but they're not. \n\nMore than that, you didn't agree to their terms of continued living with them. So, instead of throwing a tantrum, you packed up and moved out. I don't think that is unreasonable at all.

They don't get to complain that they set a price higher than the market could bear.\n\nAnd FWIW, if you had stayed and paid rent you would have been well within your rights to stop doing household chores as long as you cleaned up your own messes and space. Tenants don't typically clean their landlords' living space, just their own.\n\nYour parents are only slight AHs, but they are mainly because they did this as a reaction to your brother whining about something that was none of his business and not bc they needed the money or wanted to help you transition to paying your own bills", "You are NTA.  Everybody's just ticked off that they got more chores- which should be an indication of how much you did.  I  hope all of your future plans come to fruition.  You family will probably come around in time.  Your parents will be in for a rude awakening when your brother does the same thing.  Live your life!!", "NTA. You said in an edit chores were split fairly but you were a full time student with a part time job-- that's MORE than full time work-- and your parents had normal hour full time jobs they've presumably had a long time to figure out balancing work and house stuff with. So you taking over most of the household management doesn't make a lot of sense. They basically had you as a free housekeeper and then wanted you to also pay. \n\nI'm the oldest of seven. I had a lot of responsibility young because of a parent's illness and my dad working a lot of overtime. I did some of this household management stuff as a teen and I didn't mind it-- my family needed it, my mom hadn't planned to get very ill. I even took a gap year to help while my mom was recovering. But when I started college, I moved out, and nobody gave me grief about it-- nobody in the family accused me of abandoning them because that is a NORMAL transition in life. If she had relapsed I would have taken a semester or two off because that would be extenuating circumstances, but normal jobs are NOT. Helping out when you're part of a family is fine, but it's your parents' responsibility to figure out how to balance work and home and maybe cut back on some hours if they need to, or ask the other adult children still living at home to pitch in if they aren't pursuing careers.", "Jesus, your family is acting like they lost their best employee, not a son/brother", "Brother learned an important lesson \n\nNTA", "NAH. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask an adult to pay rent, but you found a different situation that works much better for you! I don't think your family being upset that you left rises to the level of AH (it's understandable they would miss you, though the specific complaints you mentioned are all transactional and veering them in the direction of AH if that's really all they care about) unless they start punishing you in some way for growing up and living your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
