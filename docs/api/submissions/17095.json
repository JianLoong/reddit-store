You have bigger problems, though, because this is not a healthy dynamic either financially or emotionally.", "NTA - but, really, this discussion should have been had before mingling finances.  Good luck extricating yourself out of that situation...", "NTA, bills and other necessities come before wants. You need to stop paying for his shit if he doesn't understand that.", "NTA and I hope you also have a separate account for individual spending/expenses rather than all of your money going into the joint account. \n\nYour partner is totally irresponsible. If you borrow money, the first thing you do with your next batch of income is pay back the money.", "They're taking the absolute piss and more concerning- taking advantage of your kindness. See how the attitude towards you changes when you stop lending. I am in a similar situation currently, and I get called 'stingy' when I don't buy them things like cigarettes etc. They go out constantly, buy takeaways and new clothes. They want a house together but they are constantly lending off of me, like your situation after I pay for everything. They live with me rent free. They owe me a few hundred so far. My friends have told me to ditch them pronto.", "NTA. You have been contributing more towards your expenses for a while now, the least he can do is pay you back to get himself back on track and once he doesn't owe you anymore, and is able to contribute equitably to the bills, he can do all the shopping he wants with his own leftover money. Instalment plans for things such as clothes are never a good idea anyway.", "Packages coming to the house, making payments on purchases? He gets angry with you when you ask to be prioritized? Giving you the silent treatment? \n\nYou're partner is not a responsible adult, he's a child. He gets upset when confronted with reality. He is self-indulgent, chases immediate gratification and refuses to budget, and turns to others (parent, you) when he runs out of cash. \n\nIf I were you, I'd write all this down in a clear, factual way and suggest that he take a class in personal finance, budgeting, etc. Because if this is his M.O., your life is going to continue down this path, and pretty soon YOUR finances are going to be as messy as his. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He's giving you the silent treatment because he knows it'll get him out of actually having to pay you back. You are 100% in the right here and need to call him out on his bullshit.

There are several concerning things about him.", "NTA but you are sure as hell a small ah for loaning someone who has serious money budgeting money and for buying a home with him. \nDo not enable him any more. He needs to pay his debt to you and pay his half of all bills. \nPut your foot down with him.", "Thankyou, I've not thought of it in that way, enabling him. I guess that's what he's been able to have off his parents.", "This may sound nieve, but it wasn't so apparent when we wernt living together, Morgage, bills etc. Also since he's changed jobs and been struggling with cash flow for part time business. This are hard any I appreciate that, that's why I wanted to help where I could, it's a partnership. But this feels like a repated kick in the teeth tbh.", "When you are in that situation though and ask what you think is a perfectly reasonable question in a considerate way someone reacts like that, it makes you question your perception / reality of things. It's so confusing. \n\nI agree, but 80% of the relationship is really good. However I can see this being a reoccurring issue if things continue how they are.", "As part of the talk we had, me being in a position to pay more, means I should cover more of the bills. Untill he could. But like you say he isn't going to be in that position if doesn't save.", "Definitely this. You need a separate account so he doesn't keep siphoning your funds. You can control how much you put in the shared account. It may seem controlling but if he's overspending then you have to protect yourself until you two work this out.", "And why haven't you? Living with you rent free, and they call you stingy? You're being used, I'm sorry to tell you. Why do you put up with it?", "You've got to grab control of the finances. He has no idea what he's doing. He is a mess for two reasons.\n\n1 - He is facing financial stress but refuses to curb his spending appropriately. That's a Hell No!\n\n2 - He is used to letting the people that love him pay his way and he doesn't see any reason that should change. And FU for suggesting it!\n\nSo maybe you want to make this relationship work instead of kicking him to the curb. That's your choice but you have to lay down the law. First a serious talk about your finances and explain how you are impacted by his refusal to take on some of the financial burden (as per points 1 and 2 above). Then the two of you agree upon a budget and spending allowance. He can comply or fuck off. \n\nYou may well have to wash your hands of recouping the money you've helped him with so far but certainly lock it down so you don't throw more good money after bad. Stop helping him and seperate your money from his. At least until he demonstrates some financial responsibility.", "I really don't know. They have great qualities as a person, they have a great family but I get caught up making excuses for their money problems as I feel bad as they don't earn much. They have nowhere to go if I end things also. I honestly don't know, I'm looking for advice on this situation as well as I'm stuck between conflicting thoughts currently.", "Keep track of the loans, you may have to take it from his part of the proceeds when you sell the house.", "Are you thinking of ending things? Would you, if they DID have somewhere to go?\n\nWhat's the dynamic? Do they have a \"stronger\" personality that you? Meaning, do you make nice to keep the peace whenever they get pissy when you don't want to lend good money after bad?", "Terrible attitude problems at times. I get shouted at and told to sleep in a separate room in my own house. I try to resolve issues but they blast music and say they don't want to talk. I did end things, as I booked something for a surprise date a few weeks ago and they kicked off something rotten because they told me they wanted to go on a Sunday not a Saturday. They told me to go myself and I'm selfish. They ended up saying they don't love me as I'm kicking them out, told me to keep presents for my 'next bit' and said it shows what kind of person I am making them homeless ( they had a single room in a family's house to go to). They said why would they keep all their nice stuff at mine whilst they go into a single bedroom. I explained it's because of the attitude (it's diabolical) and said, it's your problem if you can't handle it. I would say I'm quite worried about the backlash. If they lived back at home I would possibly try make things work because anger aside they're a nice person, but living together is draining me financially.", "NTA\n\nWhat you have is a leach infestation. Kick him out before he spends any more of your money. He's never paying you back.\n\nEdit: Missed the part where you bought a house together. Put yourself on a firm budget and stop loaning him money. Get the house sold as soon as feasible and get rid of this guy.", "NTA\n\n\n\nMultiple red flags from him\ud83d\ude15\n\n\n\nPlease be careful to not allow this situation go any further \ud83d\ude4f", "Only for not tightening the screws on a habitual overspender in comparison to his means.", "You two are not on the same page financially, \n\nIt is not a complete deal breaker, but communication is important.\n\na) Stop lending him any money.  He needs to prioritize his share of the bills, period.  NO is a complete sentence.\n\nb) He needs to pay back what he owes.  Consider a payment plan.  You know what the debt and what is reasonable time period.\n\nc) He has to be willing to agree to a budget. and stick to it.  There should be consequences if he can't stick to it.  Consequences should be stated ahead of time.  Consequences should probably be and even tighter restriction of luxury (unnecessary) spending. \n\nThere is bound to be complaining or whining about this.  No one likes to lose control.  Many men feel emasculated when they aren't in control of the finances.  Consider a consultation with a financial planner / accountant.  Having someone else (a neutral person) explaining the consequences of various financial strategies / patterns may help him start to understand that profligate spending is only going to drive you two into a hole.\n\nGood Luck\n\nNTA", "NTA but don\u2019t lend/give him another dime.. I think you really f\u2019ed up not only buying a home with him and giving him money.. if he\u2019s getting \u201cannoyed\u201d because he has to pay you back that\u2019s not a good sign.", ">struggling with cash flow for part time business If he\u2019s taking your money to do something on the side, that\u2019s either a failed business you\u2019re propping up with your own money, or you are subsidizing his hobby."]}
