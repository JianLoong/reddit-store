We have been married for four years, but me and my stepdaughter are not particularly close and neither is she and my bio daughter.\n\nThis week, I came home after work and went to use the common bathroom (the one that is shared by my daughters) since my wife was in the shower. Bio daughter was at my ex-wife's house that day. When I went into her bathroom, I found it a complete disaster. There was hair in the sink, shampoo bottles in disarray, it littered with tampon wrappers and used tampons (you could literally see the blood). I yelled at my stepdaughter and told her to come clean the mess she made, to which she snapped back that it was her bathroom and that the hair and shampoo bottles were bio daughter's. I asked if the tampons were hers and she said they were.\n\nI told her that she was living in my house, she pays no rent, and that it was unacceptable to leave used tampons lying in the bathroom because it's unsanitary and absolutely disgusting to look at. She went crying to my wife who said I was overreacting and that it's a normal teen girl thing, and that I was being offensive by calling the tampons disgusting since it's part of being a woman. My wife also complained about how bio daughter left the bathroom messy too, but I said hair and shampoo bottles vs literal used tampons lying around were different (I did tell her I would talk with my daughter, though).\n\nI said that when stepdaughter buys her own house, she can leave all the tampons she wants but under my roof she'll dispose of them properly and keep the bathroom clean. I also said that if I see this happen again, I'll ground her and possibly take away other privileges. My wife and stepdaughter both think that I'm being unreasonable, dramatic, and that I'm favoring my bio daughter.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit 1:  Tampons were literally lying around, not in the trash. To be specific, a couple on the counter, one on the floor, and one behind the toilet bowl. Wrappers were all over. That's the reason I told her to dispose them properly. Shampoo bottles were in the shower area (there's a designated shelf for the bottles but they were just on the floor and some toppled over)\n\nEdit 2: I'm getting a lot of comments about the yelling, which are valid - I do want to clarify that it was more of \"\\[stepdaughter's name\\], come clean the mess you made in the bathroom!\" rather than yelling at her the entire time (especially not the part where I told her it was unsanitary)\n\nEdit 3: About the rent thing - definitely worded terribly and that's on me. I said that in response to her argument that it was her bathroom and meant that she's not paying for anything, I provide her with this space and expect her to show some appreciation and cleanliness by simply keeping it clean\n\n\\--\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nThanks everyone for your comments. I took some time to reflect, calm down, and did apologize to my SD about the rent comment. Among other things, I told her that she was welcome in the house and that she was free to the bathroom for all her needs, but also said that I expect more sense of hygiene in the future. I also called my daughter, briefly explained the situation, and told her we will be having a family discussion when she comes home about overall cleanliness.\n\nTo my utter shock, when I asked SD where she disposed of the tampons since I noticed they were all gone and the blood was mostly cleaned off, I found out that she flushed all of them down the toilet and it's completely clogged. There's a trashcan in the bathroom. I don't know if she did it out of anger or out of ignorance, but my wife is refusing to do anything about it.\n\nI'm at a complete loss here.", "created_utc": 1667280296, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yizqxt/aita_for_yelling_at_my_stepdaughter_about_her/", "score": 687, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure seeing blood everywhere was a shock and it's not nice, but we can't control where it goes (initially). It's really important it gets cleaned up quickly. \n\nI think you should find out if she has everything she needs in there  to help her keep herself and the bathroom clean and also tell her your going to be talking to bio daughter about it too. \n\nAnd like some people have said, make a bathroom cleaning rota too.", "NTA the yelling is surely not the way to go but you are right, it is disgusting to just leave used tampons all over the place and your daughter should learn that she has to clean the mess she made.", "NTA - 15 years old is old enough to know how to properly dispose of a tampon.

They should be in the bin. (Blood is much more annoying to clean once it dries, period blood does smell off when left sitting around for a while, and bio daughter should not be having to deal with/move someone else's used tampons to use the bathroom).\n\nHowever, being able to 'literally see the blood' is not disgusting. It's just a fact of living with women sometimes, so you did have a 'man scared of periods'-sounding moment there.\n\nI note too that you thought hair and shampoo bottles lying around was a 'disaster' at first, and then suddenly nbd when it was your daughter doing it. Trust that your step daughter will note and remember the difference.\n\n*Both* of your daughters have a responsibility to keep the bathroom clean.

Kids can be messy, at times....blended families are often at odds when it comes to discipline.  You have to pick and choose your battles, and you should have left this one to your wife to address with her daughter.\n\nIt's NOT a girl thing to leave used, bloody tampons all over the bathroom floor, but I sense you might be exaggerating the details, here.  Otherwise, you are living with slobs.\n\nYour own daughter, even if she was at her mom's home at the time, could definitely have contributed to the mess in their shared bathroom, so don't be so quick to polish her halo.\n\nIn short, much ado about nothing.", "a 15 yo doesn't own u rent. maybe don't tell to yell at another when ur daughter is a slob too.

Confrontation like that is not going to go well and quite frankly I\u2019m not surprised she went to her mom. You also need to consider your relationship with her as well. Maybe ask your wife to talk to her about it instead of yelling at her. Because I would feel embarrassed now even as an adult if a man I\u2019m not close with yelled at me about something regarding my period. \n\nAlso, rent dude? Really? Come on, she\u2019s 15.

She's lazy about making sure her tampons land in the trash because she feels no one who would judge her is looking.\n\nTelling her this is disgusting is like going through her dirty underwear and saying it's disgusting. It feels violating on an intimate level. \n\nIt's hard to come up with an analogy that would make sense to an older male. Imagine you've just started a brand new job. Things are still new to you. The expectation is that your boss will look at your finished work only, and you will have the ability to approach your work any way you wanted. Now, despite the expectation that your boss will only look at your finished work, you find out that your boss is watching every move you make. She criticizes how you approach the initial work, the work that you thought you would have the privacy to handle however you wanted. She even goes through your trashcan, and criticizes the work that you threw away. She calls it disgusting in front of the entire office.\n\nYour step daughter has a hygiene problem, you are right about that. Before you can address the hygiene problem you have to adjust the way she sees the bathroom first. Establish that it's not a private place. Explain to her that other people may need to use that bathroom from time to time. It may be you or your wife. It may be outsiders visiting the house. Set those expectations and there's a chance she may change her behavior with no additional prompting.\n\nIf she continues to have hygiene problems AND they happen in public places, then you can address the cleanliness problem. An inability to regulate private functions in public spaces often indicates emotional problems. You'll need to work with a therapist if that's the case.\n\nYour wife must be the one who handles these conversations with her. You are not close enough to your step daughter to talk about tampons or hair shedding.\n\nTell your wife your concerns. Let her take point on addressing these issues with your step daughter. Your concerns do matter, but you are not the one to talk to your step daughter about them. Your step daughter is young and growing and may continue to make mistakes. Address these gaps as things to learn, not wrongdoings to be punished. Do not yell at your step daughter about anything, but especially not about tampons. Do not expect the same behavior from her in private and public spaces. \n\nYou mentioned that your daughter shares the bathroom with your step daughter and that does make me worry your step daughter does display inappropriate behavior and poor hygiene in semi-public places. Ask your daughter if there's a problem with that bathroom. Be aware that your bio daughter may be a culprit as well in this uncleanliness.", "YTA because you clearly view your stepdaughter with disdain and handled this very poorly. Teenagers and tweens are not known for being the most tidy people on earth. The appropriate way to handle that is to calmly, CALMLY, gently, GENTLY guide them into learning better habits for keeping things neat. Not to fly off the handle yelling, shaming, and humiliating them. And you should have asked your wife to handle the menstruation related aspects of this interaction. Also, 15 year olds are CHILDREN- they do not \"pay rent\" anywhere. Get a grip.", "NTA I am a mother and have a daughter. If I ever go in to the bathroom and see used tampons etc I shout at my daughter to come clean it up. certain things are \njust nasty, unhygienic and warrant a strong reaction. So called woke people will say it\u2019s mean and horrible but sometimes when people are shocked by outright nastiness they react accordingly. \nBoth girls need some home training and mum needs to stop defending nasty behaviour. \nRent comment is unneeded, but understandable based on the nonsense response from the stepdaughter.

The whole you don't pay rent thing really makes a teenager feel like they don't belong there, but simultaneously have nowhere to go. It's an awful situation.\n\nEdit: I want to add... does this bathroom have proper accommodations for a teenager?

These comments coming from someone not close is even more humiliating, no wonder she cried to her mum. So you bring your wife to the bathroom in private to show her, discuss the situation with her and say this is not acceptable and agree on an approach coming forward. This approach should be fair on both kids so instead of saying someone\u2019s mess is ok and another is not, maybe clean up the bathroom and talk to both kids about what the minimum state of the bathroom should be. This could be a family discussion where the two girls have input in what is that standard and what they\u2019ll be doing to keep up with the standard.
