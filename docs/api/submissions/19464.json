If the reason she is cutting you off is because you divorced her unfaithful step mother and then found love with someone else, that's very immature of her and a refusal to see you as a person with emotional needs, but rather she does see you as an ATM and even your adult children don't get the right to treat you that way.\n\nI suspect, however, there is something more, but if she won't talk to you about it then still, OP you are NTA, because she won't talk to you about it and give you a chance to make right what was wrong or apologize or whatever else she needs from you.

They learn that a lot of men are only attracted to women 10-15 years younger, and older men start to come onto them with absurd frequency.  Every time I went out in public as a college student, without fail at least one 40-50 year old dude would catcall, harass, or approach me in an obvious romantic/sexual way.  Existing as a woman is probably hitting her like a ton of bricks, and it sounds like she's projecting new insecurities and difficulties onto you.  Given that, I think it's an easy leap for her to assume  Mom had an emotional affair because you were no longer attracted to her, or for some other reason that makes Mom the victim...even if that's not true, what do you think Mom has been telling her? Why do you think your daughter's reaction to this has been so different than your son's? \n\nLook, she's your kid still, and 19 is a tough age. Functionally, 19 year olds are children in many ways, and they are adapting to the world being an overwhelming and sometimes shitty place.  I would not destroy her future over not talking to you for 6 months in the wake of multiple life altering events. If you've put this money aside for her college tuition, follow through on your commitment to her.  Even if she never talks to you again, you will know that you did everything you could for her, and that you were always a father she and her Mom could count on.  You gave her a start in life, and she will have that to think on and look back on as she gets older. Hopefully she is wrong to direct her anger at you and eventually realizes as much, especially when she sees that you didnt give up on her-even when you got a new wife and kid, even when she didn't know how to divide her loyalties and affection properly or which he said/she said story about this affair to believe.   \n\nAnd this might get me downvotes, but unlike most of Reddit, I do think parents who can afford college tuition have the responsibility to give their children a shot at it (so long as they are decent people, and being in a fight with you doesnt make your daughter a bad or irresponsible person).  That is because this is, in fact, the view of the **federal government**.  The system is set up that way. One's personal feelings about it are near irrelevant. It is parents' income that qualifies or disqualifies students for financial aid. If you have the money to help her pay for college, because of your income she is not eligible for grants or subsidized loans.  There is a cap on unsubsidized loans which are not enough to cover the typical costs of in state tuition. Private loans, even with their high interest rates and no income based or public service deferment options, still require credit worthy borrowers (which 19 year olds are generally not).  Basically, she's still financially tied to you and dependent on you for the purposes of her education. Forcing her to drop out of school because she is struggling to come to terms with or understand this divorce seems...not the right move.", "NTA.

You are fully responsible for your own actions, and that much has been effectively drilled into our heads, starting from our very childhood.

Do you think she's going to want to have a relationship with her dad who negatively affected her future (cutting her tuition and thus making it harder to get a post secondary education) at the same time he welcomed a new wife and child into his life?

No, but it sounds like one of those things where she just needs time to adjust and to know her dad is still there for her and loves her. Taking away your support is not helping.\n\nPersonally I think a parent child relationship is something inherently non-reciprocal. The parent, as the one who decided to have a child, should provide unconditional love and support, and the child, who has no say in being born or being their parents child, is not inherently bound to the same feelings. It's obviously best if they do, but that's the job of the parent, to raise their child and do their best by them so that the child is someone who loves them and wants to provide back to them.

But you should have told her you were cutting her tuition because she didn't even have time to fill out a FAFSA or make plans of her own. That could leave her in a really difficult situation, possibly years of debt to pay off that she wasn't aware she'd have. She's 19, you don't know her feelings or reasoning.\n\nAs parents, we are there to love them and support them, not expect love back. Adult kids act out and get mad sometimes for things that don't make sense, all you can do is be there for them when they're ready. We walk into parenthood thinking our love will be reciprocated, when it isn't always that way. There are seasons to parenthood.\n\nIt really boils down to this: were you paying for her tuition for HER or for yourself? If it was for her, you shouldn't have cut it in the first place.

You chose to be her dad and you can\u2019t just cut things off because it\u2019s hard. She clearly needs space and had to block you to get it.

He says the ex's affair was discovered 2 years ago. Assuming they started divorce proceedings immediately, depends on the state, but with a waiting period, especially with property and minor children, the divorce took a while to finalize (a year or more). The fiance just gave birth, so she got pregnant 9 months ago...I think dad def gave the appearance of moving on way too fast despite how this would affect his children, and to start a new family lickety split of course would sting. Daughters may be more sensitive, odds are she has had some rough experiences with dudes in a way the teenage boys have not with girls.

He just did it to fuck with me. All that is to say - I have some perspective here and I am not inclined to side with the parent in a 50/50.\n\nStill, I think it really depends on the circumstances under which he agreed to pay for her expenses, whether his and his wife's finances are shared or not and what their relationship is actually like.\n\nIt's very normal for a person in a marriage to refer to a financial decision as 'our decision'. If he has tried to reach out to her and has been rejected, he is not legally nor morally obligated to assist financially. It doesn't sound like there is any reason to go no contact for the sake of her mental health, he doesn't sound like a spiteful ass - he is just signaling that his financial support is contingent on her being cordial with him, which she isn't, and which is a very reasonable boundary to have.

There's definitely more to this, OP may not be fully aware of it. The speed at which things have changed may just give fuel to the ex which is too late to do much about now. \n\nThe daughter is also the eldest child with a good existing relationship with her mother.

When I was 19, I wasn't speaking to either of my parents. And there wasn't even any \"real\" reason like a divorce or similar big family problems. We just had lots of fights in my late teenage years, which led to me moving out at 18 and then almost completely cutting contact for like 2 years.\n\nAfter that time they made an effort to try and get into contact again, and it worked. They apologized for some things that they think they did wrong (I don't think it was only their fault, they could have done some things better for sure, but I definitely wasn't an easy teenager either) and we actually got close again. Now, 10 years later, we have a great relationship and I am really grateful for them.\n\n19 can be such a difficult age. You're starting into adult life, trying to get your life together, scared of the future, not sure where things might take you. It's also an age where some mental problems can start to develop or show on top of it all. And it isn't easy for the parents either, going from seeing their child as a literal kid that they have control and say over, to accepting them as an adult individual whose choices and opinions are valid and who might want to live their life in unexpected ways. And I really think parents should try to put in the extra effort for their children in these situations. The children might make their own mistakes in life, but as long as it's within forgivable limits, the parents should try to be there for them and reconnect when possible.\n\nFor this daughter it must be such a horrible situation. First her mum hurt her so much by causing the divorce, then her dad starts a new family almost immediately. She must feel so abandoned and lost, like she just moved out for collage and her whole family just crumbled, no one is left to trust or rely on. If her dad really now just cuts his payment, that would be so, so bad. It's like: Well you are angry at me, so have a nice life, you don't have a dad anymore from now on. On top of the financial problems that might make her having to stop school all together. It could ruin her future, and ruin any connection and trust that she might have left towards her family.
