I'm thinking she's still pretty messed up over it.\n\nMeanwhile, women going out into the world get bombarded with messages about how their worth declines as they age, and about how they become less attractive in their late thirties and forties while men just become \"silver foxes\". They learn that a lot of men are only attracted to women 10-15 years younger, and older men start to come onto them with absurd frequency.  Every time I went out in public as a college student, at least one 40-50 year old dude would catcall or approach me in an obvious romantic/sexual way without fail.  Existing as a woman is probably hitting her like a ton of bricks, and it sounds like she's projecting new insecurities and difficulties onto you.  Given that, I think it's an easy leap for her to assume  Mom had an emotional affair because you were no longer attracted to her and looking for an out to date younger...even if that's nowhere near the truth. \n\nLook, she's your daughter, and 19 is a tough age. Functionally, 19 year olds are still children in many ways, and they are adapting to the world being an overwhelming and sometimes shitty place.  I would not destroy her future over not talking to you for 6 months in the wake of multiple life altering events. If you've put this money aside for her college tuition, follow through on your commitment to her.  Even if she never talks to you again, you will know that you did everything you could for her, and that you were always a father she and her Mom could count on.  You gave her a start in life, and she will have that to think on and look back on as she gets older. Hopefully she is wrong to direct her anger at you and eventually realizes as much, especially when she sees that you didnt give up on her-even when you got a new wife and kid, even when she didn't know how to divide her loyalties and affection properly or which he said/she said story about this affair to believe. \n\n(And this might get me downvotes, but unlike most of Reddit, I do think parents who can afford college tuition have the responsibility to pay for it for their children who are decent people with the ability to succeed. It is parents' income that qualifies or disqualifies students for financial aid. If you have the money to help her pay for college, she is not eligible for grants or subsidized loans.  There is a cap on unsubsidized loans which may not be enough to cover her costs, and private loans would require a cosigner. Basically, she's still financially tied to you and dependent on you for the purposes of her education, and using that fact as a power move just because you're angry at her and disappointed with her is probably not the way to go.)", "NTA.

You are fully responsible for your own actions, and that much has been effectively drilled into our heads, starting from our very childhood.

Nope, nuh-uh. \n\nFurthermore, she has no say in your relationship; I\u2019m not saying she can\u2019t have an opinion, but she doesn\u2019t get to guilt you or shame you for moving on after what her mother did. Her trying to punish you while still expecting you to finance her is pretty damn bold.", "Why would the daughter assume OP would continue to shell out for her when she's completely cut off all contact?   I'm also not convinced OP made any real effort to help his daughter process these changes.  Did you sit down with her and tell her you were dating and offer counseling?  Did you give your ex a heads-up or talk with her when you suspected she was talking bad about you to your daughter?  And I'm sure someone knows your daughter's mailing address.

But remember you are the father in this relationship, you are the one who decided to have a kid, and part of having a kid is often paying for or helping pay for tuition. And also consider how this affects your relationship with your daughter going forward. Do you think she's going to want to have a relationship with her dad who negatively affected her future (cutting her tuition and thus making it harder to get a post secondary education) at the same time he welcomed a new wife and child into his life? How is that gonna make her feel? It's certainly not going to help make her want to spend time with you. She's young (still technically a teenager) and struggling with some major changes to her family dynamic. Is it the most mature way she could handle this? No, but it sounds like one of those things where she just needs time to adjust and to know her dad is still there for her and loves her. Taking away your support is not helping.\n\nPersonally I think a parent child relationship is something inherently non-reciprocal. The parent, as the one who decided to have a child, should provide unconditional love and support, and the child, who has no say in being born or being their parents child, is not inherently bound to the same feelings. It's obviously best if they do, but that's the job of the parent, to raise their child and do their best by them so that the child is someone who loves them and wants to provide back to them. I know not everyone thinks this way, but it is a common interpretation by millenials and gen z, so it may put your daughter's feelings and reactions to your actions into perspective.", "You should have told your daughter before hand thru your sons that you are cutting her off.
