I'm thinking she's still pretty messed up over it.\n\nAdditionally, women going out into the world start to get a lot of messages about how their worth declines as they age, and about how they become less attractive in their late thirties and forties while men just become \"silver foxes\". They start to learn that a lot of men are only attracted to women 10-15 years younger, and start to get hit on by men your age. Being confronted with the reality of existing as a woman in the world is probably hitting her like a brick, and it sounds like she's projecting new insecurities onto you.  With the type of things young women are bombarded with at that age, I don't think it's a leap for her to assume  Mom had an emotional affair because you were no longer attracted to her, and looking for an out to date younger women. \n\nLook, she's your daughter, and 19 is a messed up age. Functionally, 19 year olds are still children in many ways, and they are adapting to learning that the world is a shitty place.  I would not destroy her future over not talking to you for 6 months. If you've put this money aside for her college tuition, follow through on your commitment to her.  Even if she never talks to you again, you will know that you did everything you could for her, and that you were always a father she and her Mom could count on. \n\n(And this might get me downvotes, but unlike most of Reddit, I do think parents who can afford college tuition have the responsibility to pay for it for their children who are decent people with the ability to succeed. It is parents' income that qualifies or disqualifies students for financial aid. If you have the money to help her pay for college, she is not eligible for grants or subsidized loans.  There is a cap on unsubsidized loans which may not be enough to cover her costs, and private loans would require a cosigner. Basically, she's still financially tied to you and dependent on you for the purposes of her education, and using that fact as a power move just because you're angry at her and disappointed with her is probably not the way to go. \n\nI'd say, be the bigger person and keep reaching out and following through on your promises to her.  Then, if she still won't talk to you, wash your hands of it. You did your best and put her out into the world, and hopefully one day she will realize all you've done for her and hear out your side of this story.", "NTA.

You are fully responsible for your own actions, and that much has been effectively drilled into our heads, starting from our very childhood.

Do you think she's going to want to have a relationship with her dad who negatively affected her future (cutting her tuition and thus making it harder to get a post secondary education) at the same time he welcomed a new wife and child into his life? How is that gonna make her feel? It's certainly not going to help make her want to spend time with you. She's young (still technically a teenager) and struggling with some major changes to her family dynamic. Is it the most mature way she could handle this? No, but it sounds like one of those things where she just needs time to adjust and to know her dad is still there for her and loves her. Taking away your support is not helping.\n\nPersonally I think a parent child relationship is something inherently non-reciprocal. The parent, as the one who decided to have a child, should provide unconditional love and support, and the child, who has no say in being born or being their parents child, is not inherently bound to the same feelings. It's obviously best if they do, but that's the job of the parent, to raise their child and do their best by them so that the child is someone who loves them and wants to provide back to them. I know not everyone thinks this way, but it is a common interpretation by millenials and gen z, so it may put your daughter's feelings and reactions to your actions into perspective.", "You should have told your daughter before hand thru your sons that you are cutting her off.

Sounds like his daughter knows the cost of everything yet the value of nothing.", "You cannot \"get counseling\" for a legally competent adult. You can suggest and offer to fund counseling and that's it.\n\n(Well, I suppose if someone is financially dependent, you could make counseling a condition for that support to continue, but it's unlikely to be productive or have a positive effect on the relationship.)", "Cheating mom relays the message.", "She\u2019s 19 and hurting.", "This is typical of teenagers today.

YTA for sure", "Why does your new wife get a say about you paying for your daughters college? Your daughter is allowed to be upset about your \"accidental\" pregnancy and quickie marriage. You need to be the parent and keep reaching out to her. Your new wife should have never had the power to suggest stopping paying for your daughters college. That's something you discuss with your daughter, and your daughter only. Keep reaching out to her.", "Yeah that stuck out to me, too. Also, per OP, child is now born.", "Child in this case, a grown ass woman", "Let's pretend, for the sake of avoiding tangents, that OP knows whether he agreed to pay all of his children's college tuition as part of a their divorce decree.", "I mean, the daughter isn't upset at her mom who cheated on her dad, which is what LED to the divorce. She is only mad at her dad who moved on AFTER the divorce.", "How long should I have waited?", "Your daughter thinks it's wrong that you're content. She is an adult as well, so there is no incentive to give her anything if she won't talk to you. You haven't done anything wrong in my opinion.", "Exactly! She wants nothing to do with him but wants something from him? The world doesn't work that way. If he'd told someone else the headache could've got distorted down the line. Plus at that point, it would've been an ultimatum. The daughter made her bed when she blocked OP", "Pretty sure that's their decision to make.", "I stayed silent and prayed my abusive, awful father wouldn\u2019t stop paying my rent when I was in college. My mom had already picked up the slack for the tuition he dropped. She was abusive and guilting me about it in her own way. I was trapped. Privileged to have a lot of financial help for my college, but trapped, abused, and unwell. I was 19 also, and it is absolute BS to have to be the adult in the room full of your own parents who fucked you up throughout your life and now depend on you to be the mature one. Absolute fucking BS.\n\nI\u2019m not saying OPs daughter is in this boat, but I am saying that if anything toxic is at play in this obviously toxic situation regarding this new pregnant wife, and dad having a pattern of using money to fix problems instead of addressing the root cause, then I empathize more with the daughter. Even if she\u2019s entitled and privileged, taking advantage of her father, he is still the one with the upper hand in this\u2026 she is an adult freely testing the situation, but he is also an adult so he needs to respond accordingly.

But since you didn\u2019t you could simply just try being a bit more sympathetic to why your daughter is struggling and not just cut off her tuition without warning (and you definitely shouldn\u2019t let your wife have a say in that).", "I think it would be beneficial to look at it from her perspective. It\u2019s dumb to imply you were being unfaithful, but she could genuinely feel that way. She could feel abandoned and like you\u2019re moving on too quickly. Those are valid feelings for her to have. She has gone nuclear, that\u2019s true, but she is your daughter. If you want the possibility of a relationship in the future, the cord shouldn\u2019t have been pulled like it was. It\u2019s okay for you to make that decision, but doing it directly after the new baby was born sends her a very clear message that you seem to be missing regarding the timing of this all. \n\nYou\u2019re not a bad person, but the decisions you\u2019ve made (and your ex-wife because I assume your divorce is at least kind of related to the infidelity you mentioned below) are the direct cause for you daughters emotions.

Like, 15\u00d7 more so.", "You should have known that the second you and her mother separated, you should have castrated yourself and lived a life of celibacy, so as to not upset the apple cart and keep your adult daughter on the pedestal she put herself on. \n\nYou awful person, you!\n\nLook, obviously I am kidding but she does not appear to be interested in having a father anymore. Why? Who knows? And your attempts to reach out were slapped away. \n\nCongrats on the new baby, BTW", "Long enough for her to grieve and process that the family she's known has broken. It's been like a year, and you're already married to a much younger woman and have a new baby. Are you seriously scratching your head over why she's upset?

I\u2019d be mad at you to.", "Until all of your kids from your original family were ready for you to have a do-over family.", "She's not being the adult though, she's actively taking offence on behalf of her mother who was divorced for having an affair.", "When you'll do something major like that, yes. You'll talk to the ex or ask your other kids. He is an AH for not giving a warning, hell even for the not paying if he promised to do it initially.", "Wasn\u2019t the mom cheating first? This isn\u2019t even cheating.", "Upset is not the same thing as breaking all contact.   She can be upset.
