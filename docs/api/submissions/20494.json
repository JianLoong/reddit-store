I'm temporarily staying with a 46yo family friend and her 2 daughters (13 and 22). I pay $600 a month (+ all my own food) to stay on her couch. My footprint here is minimal, as during the day I sit in my vehicle all day working (from my phone). I don't even bring my clothes inside. \n\nAnyways, her oldest daughter got in to a car accident roughly 2 weeks ago and she didn't have insurance (she was at fault). Her car is totaled. She has been getting rides from coworkers to and from work to try and save for another vehicle. However, her coworkers are tired of picking her up, as it's a 20+ minute detour every morning at 6am. She works about 45 minutes away. So for the past 2 days her mother has been going from working the overnight, back home to pick her kid up, driving her kid to work, coming home to sleep and then up again at 1:30pm to go back and pick her kid up from work and then trying to squeeze a nap in prior to her overnight shift. She said it's also costing her an extra $80 in gas a week. \n\nShe just asked me to start driving her kid to work until her daughter saves up enough money for another car. I absolutely refuse. For starters, I have 330k miles on my vehicle and a gas leak. It cost me $40 to drive a half hour. That's $80+ a day in gas and frankly, I am not willing to do it. I simply don't want to. My work day starts at 8am and I already don't like getting up that early. Add in the other headache details and I'm all set. My roommate is trying to guilt trip me in to it; saying I'm staying here too and \"everyone needs to chip in and pull their weight\". I feel I already am, considering what I pay her to sleep on a couch and then hang out in my vehicle all day. AITA?\n\nETA: I'm 28 weeks pregnant. My husband died when I was 8 weeks. I spiraled and lost everything after his passing. That's why I'm here. There's not much more to say about it.", "created_utc": 1687644453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i5215/aita_for_refusing_to_bring_my_roommates_kid_to/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
