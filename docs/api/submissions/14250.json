I may get downvoted because of what I'm saying, but I'm telling you out of experience and I don't want that to happen to you.\n\nIf you want to keep living with him you should really watch out for anything, even for stupid stuff like you didn't cook what he wanted so he got sad, or you didn't dance with him at a wedding because you didn't want to after dancing with your dad so he had a tantrum (true story), or he got sick and started acting like a baby (also true story). If it's obvious that he needs to mature and it will take a long while, you either give him time (though even if you do it's not 100% possible he's going to get better at managing his emotions) or get out.\nAnd if you give him time you should probably put limits in your relationship.", "NTA\n\nWhat a weird overreaction for someone you say isn\u2019t struggling financially.

It\u2019s that you have to acknowledge and *at least* empathize with your partner. \n\nThese small matters are why people don\u2019t last in relationships or do but with building resentment.\n\nEdit to change to NTA. I clearly missed the locking himself in the bathroom for an hour. I\u2019d find somewhere else to live.

Did he get punished for tearing his clothes?

Reason why I ask is because I grew up in a very unstable household and my mentality for buying shit was fucked up until I got into my 30s. \n\nI was able to afford stuff and had a very good job at a young age but I always felt like I was one disaster from winding up homeless. I would literally go to the soup kitchen, all my socks had holes in them, I had very few clothes, etc etc. \n\nIt's not that I wasn't able to afford those things it's I was mentally fucked up from my childhood.", "Do you know if his parents provided adequately for him, if he feels like it would be selfish for him to have more than he has?

While weird, they are unimportant in the grand scheme of things and you seem overly critical for bringing it up more than once.", "Right?! I buy a new pack of socks and briefs every time I go to Costco, which is every two weeks. There is nothing better than new socks and new briefs.

And OP is NTA", "Happy cake day", "Nowhere in my comment did I say anything about the frequency \"everyone\" does laundry. I certainly never made any sweeping generalizations, so don't project. \n\nHowever, since you brought it up, I do think that if you're doing laundry using a washing machine and dryer and you're paying the bills, running it every other day or even every three days is a waste of money and resources. Not to mention that's a lot of time and effort. If you have the money and time to do that, good for you, but it's still unnecessary for the environment. \n\nBased on OP's bf childish reaction though, I'd wager that he doesn't do his laundry that often and reuses his dirty clothes. He pouted like a child and locked himself away, leaving OP to do the rest of the unpacking and cleaning. Doesn't seem like someone who would keep on top of laundry every three days.", "I am not sure when she posted that comment. It is not in original post.", "NTA\n\nEven if he only owns 3 pairs of socks and 3 pairs of underwear, he *still* needs somewhere to put the other 2 pairs while wearing the 1, and using a drawer for them is a reasonable solution.

What kind of person doesn't have at least enough clothes to last for at least a week? Honestly this is red flag that he can't/doesn't want to take care of himself properly. \nAlso you are NTA. You just jokingly said something and it was unexpectedly true. It was his own choice to get offended over something so small. That is another red flag.", "And a comment anyone would make if someone only had 3 pairs of socks and 3 pairs of underwear. That's a lot of extra washing. Or a lot of wearing something dirty.", "Depends on the tone OP used and if they say things like this to their bf a lot.", "Oh.

Still not really sure where you thought I was talking about \"everyone,\" especially since in my reply to you, I clarified I was not trying to generalize and talk about everyone. In fact, the only person who said anything about \"everyone does laundry once a week\" was you. \n\nI can see where you may have misinterpreted the second paragraph of my reply as speaking directly to you, though I did not mean it that way. I meant you in the general plural sense as in \"If *someone* was doing laundry every other day\" not *you* particular. Obviously, if you have a high efficiency system, it doesn't apply to you. But for most people who don't, washing clothes every other day may not be the best move.

This could be a  strange reaction to trauma.", "NTA, I would take a step back and observe his behaviors and see if they end up benefitting him.

That right there should tell you not to make fun of him.\n\nWhether he can afford more is not the issue. The issue is how you aren't paying attention to the cues he's giving you. Making fun of someone in a way that you already know is hurtful is not how to show your concern or caring.\n\n>I was truly cringed out about his attitude\n\nIs it \"attitude\" to have hurt feelings?\n\n> just ignoring it.\n\nThen after hurting his feelings to the point that he left your presence for an hour, you ignored him while he was hiding, ignored him when he came out, and then you left as soon as you finished. It didn't occur to you to apologize to him for hurting his feelings in all that time? I mean, yes he was acting out instead of using his words, but hiding away and then emerging is a pretty clear signal that he wants an apology.\n\nWhile I think that he should have told you why he was so upset right away, your attitude makes me think that he doubted that you can be trusted to respect how he truly feels.\n\nYTA", "ESH.
