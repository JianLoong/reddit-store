That reads to me that it\u2019s likely this was always done for him. I\u2019m NOT blaming his mother, some people just have a failure to launch into adulthood right away.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I think you need to have an honest conversation about expectations and responsibilities for the house and to each other. You\u2019re his partner, not his parent. \n\nGood luck!", "I notice the pout got him out of doing any more cleaning. \n\nYou are NTA.\n\nI have concerns about BF, though.", "INFO: has he explained why this made him so sad? You said in a comment that he can afford to buy more, so why would your joking hurt his feelings so much?", "Oh, NTA. But girl, I've been in your shoes, normally when people act like this they don't exactly change, you become their partner but also a mother figure. I may get downvoted because of what I'm saying, but I'm telling you out of experience and I don't want that to happen to you.\n\nIf you want to keep living with him you should really watch out for anything, even for stupid stuff like you didn't cook what he wanted so he got sad, or you didn't dance with him at a wedding because you didn't want to after dancing with your dad so he had a tantrum (true story), or he got sick and started acting like a baby (also true story). If it's obvious that he needs to mature and it will take a long while, you either give him time (though even if you do it's not 100% possible he's going to get better at managing his emotions) or get out.\nAnd if you give him time you should probably put limits in your relationship.", "NTA\n\nWhat a weird overreaction for someone you say isn\u2019t struggling financially.

Maybe misconstrued what you meant as an attack instead of genuine question? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call this red flag behavior, more like another commenter said, an orange flag.

I strongly suggest couples counseling before he finishes unpacking. He may have a legitimate trauma surrounding purchasing new clothing. He may also be a whiny sad sack. Even a dreadful counselor should be able to tease out the difference.", "NTA. While I admire your boyfriend's devotion to minimalism, as reflected in the small amount of clothing he owns, I do not admire the fact that he pouted like a small child for an hour over a harmless comment.

I'd ask him how you can avoid doing it in the future, but ultimately you both were being humans. Maybe he feels more stress about his clothes than you think?", "Soft YTA. You didn\u2019t follow up to see why this was the situation and/or why he was hurt.

It\u2019s that you have to acknowledge and *at least* empathize with your partner. \n\nThese small matters are why people don\u2019t last in relationships or do but with building resentment.", "Yta.\n\nU hit a sore spot and didnt follow up. There is probably history there", "YTA\n\nIf he only has 3 sets of socks/underwear, there's something going on here.\n\nDid he come from a financially disadvantaged family where that's all he had?

Did he get punished for tearing his clothes? I got beat by my stepmom for things like staining a towel when I was young.\n\nAt any rate you need to use your words, and try to work on this with him, because you already sound frustrated.

Reason why I ask is because I grew up in a very unstable household and my mentality for buying shit was fucked up until I got into my 30s. \n\nI was able to afford stuff and had a very good job at a young age but I always felt like I was one disaster from winding up homeless. I would literally go to the soup kitchen, all my socks had holes in them, I had very few clothes, etc etc. \n\nIt's not that I wasn't able to afford those things it's I was mentally fucked up from my childhood.", "Do you know if his parents provided adequately for him, if he feels like it would be selfish for him to have more than he has?

Be kind, perhaps.", "OK, so he\u2019s clearly quite sensitive about certain things, at least. If you cannot keep these little jokes and light teasing comments to yourself, then I think this sort of thing is going to keep repeating itself.\n\nMaybe he has some growing up to do, maybe you need to learn to hold your tongue to spare his feelings, or maybe the two of you are simply incompatible. \n\nBut you\u2019re NTA for making a comment most people would laugh off, with you.", "I think his reaction is excessive and not the way I would ever react to a comment like the one you made, but its clear from this comment and the post you probably comment in a negative way about his clothes, his appearance, or other aspects of his person frequently. It seems like he's frustrated with the fact that you seem to fixate on details like this. While weird, they are unimportant in the grand scheme of things and you seem overly critical for bringing it up more than once.", "Right?! I buy a new pack of socks and briefs every time I go to Costco, which is every two weeks. There is nothing better than new socks and new briefs. I doubt he does laundry every 3 days, and probably, where's them more than one day.", "And that\u2019s after sitting in the bathroom for an hour.  He doesnt sound  mature  enough for a relationship. And OP is NTA", "Happy cake day", "Nowhere in my comment did I say anything about the frequency \"everyone\" does laundry. I certainly never made any sweeping generalizations, so don't project. \n\nHowever, since you brought it up, I do think that if you're doing laundry using a washing machine and dryer and you're paying the bills, running it every other day or even every three days is a waste of money and resources. Not to mention that's a lot of time and effort. If you have the money and time to do that, good for you, but it's still unnecessary for the environment. \n\nBased on OP's bf childish reaction though, I'd wager that he doesn't do his laundry that often and reuses his dirty clothes. He pouted like a child and locked himself away, leaving OP to do the rest of the unpacking and cleaning. Doesn't seem like someone who would keep on top of laundry every three days.", "I am not sure when she posted that comment. It is not in original post.", "NTA\n\nEven if he only owns 3 pairs of socks and 3 pairs of underwear, he *still* needs somewhere to put the other 2 pairs while wearing the 1, and using a drawer for them is a reasonable solution. Unless he's wearing all 3 pairs every day, at which point that's a red flag about his mental health and he might need professional help. So, idk what's his problem would be about your comment - maybe it's not about the socks and underwear... maybe he had a bad time on the toilet?...\n\nEdited for some words", "So, what's the problem in fact? I mean, I could understand if he was so poor and it hurt and he was sick of it but somehow didn't have a choice, but since you say that's not the case, why the dramatic locking-in-the bathroom move?", "Seriously? What kind of person doesn't have at least enough clothes to last for at least a week? Honestly this is red flag that he can't/doesn't want to take care of himself properly. \nAlso you are NTA. You just jokingly said something and it was unexpectedly true. It was his own choice to get offended over something so small. That is another red flag.", "And a comment anyone would make if someone only had 3 pairs of socks and 3 pairs of underwear. That's a lot of extra washing. Or a lot of wearing something dirty.", "Depends on the tone OP used and if they say things like this to their bf a lot.", "Oh. I though it was a joke because OP said it was a joke in the title", "Communication is going to be your friend or it sounds like this relationship is doomed.", "Ah. Definitely something to bring up with him. Something I would use to evaluate the relationship.", "And you thought moving in with him was a good idea?", "Yeah, pouting in the corner would definitely put me off, too.", "I don't understand either :(", "Yeah, I did not grow up in poverty exactly, but my parents were definitely weird about clothing and being bullied in school for it contributed to my cptsd. \n\nOP, stop making fun of his clothes. If you care, find out what the deeper issue is.", "Also, if OP doesn't want to play therapist with him through this, that's okay too. Some people need to hear it, but you don't owe anyone anything. \nHis issues may not be his fault, but they are his responsibility. Loving someone who has big mental health struggles like this is often damn difficult, and not everyone is cut out for it.", "OP is def NTA here but wait a second, you buy new socks and briefs every 2 weeks? Wtf? Are they like collectors items?", "Some of us have work uniforms, bedding, towels, & general household goods that all need to be washed regularly, which fill up the machine quickly. Since you\u2019re feeling *so* high & mighty about it, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be just tickled to know that I have a high efficiency laundry setup that uses far less water & electricity than they used to.", "It's in the edit at the bottom of the post", "A poor person. Check your privilege.", "Say things like make an observation about super weird behavior?", "Sure they said it was a joke but that doesn't actually make it one. Just like I could call you a bunch of throughly repugnant shit for 0 reason and claim its a joke for the sake of plausible deniability.", "I have a feeling money is super tight on him despite what is thought, and he's depressed about not having more clothes, so instead of communicating he's built up extreme anxiety and sadness over the issue and feeling like a total failure.

Guess what though? Neither this post or my original comment was about you. Way to project and make it about yourself though lol.", "When I commented it was not there. Thanks for telling me about the edit. I did see she made a comment after also.", "I mean, I used myself as an example because your comment felt like you were implying everyone does laundry once a week, \u201cbuddy,\u201d not to make it about me. My bad for misinterpreting I guess, but you got aggressive & kinda holier-than-thou immediately so I responded defensively. Like, dang lol", "All I did was ask if her bf washed his clothes every three days or if he reused his dirty underwear. The first is fine, though more uncommon; the latter is gross. Still not really sure where you thought I was talking about \"everyone,\" especially since in my reply to you, I clarified I was not trying to generalize and talk about everyone. In fact, the only person who said anything about \"everyone does laundry once a week\" was you. \n\nI can see where you may have misinterpreted the second paragraph of my reply as speaking directly to you, though I did not mean it that way. I meant you in the general plural sense as in \"If *someone* was doing laundry every other day\" not *you* particular. Obviously, if you have a high efficiency system, it doesn't apply to you. But for most people who don't, washing clothes every other day may not be the best move. In the case of OP, she's moving into a shared apartment and in those cases, they tend to go for the cheapest washer/dryer unit, not high efficiency ones, unless you bring your own.", "He would have to do laundry every other day, unless he doesn't wear anything on laundry day."]}
