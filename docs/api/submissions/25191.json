We were both born in the US. It is common for Asians to give up everything to the point of going into debt to set their children up for success. But thankfully, neither of our parents played into that commonality.\n\nMy spouse and I weren't helping our parents financially when we were engaged. While I knew my husband's parents were not as financially comfortable as mine, I assumed they were doing well because of their lifestyle.\n\nMy husband and I found out that their flights for the past decade have been fully paid for my husband's siblings. We initially pitched in but when the costs became too much, we said no. (on average, they go to Asia yearly & fly domestically often. EDIT: they have no family in Asia. They go purely for luxury traveling).\n\nWe decided to help but with boundaries. My husband understands both sides but ultimately agrees that we need to protect our finances and future first. For me, I don't believe in consistently supporting. I don't think it's healthy. Not only does it create financial reliance (which is burdensome) but encourages financial irresponsibility. I only lend money if I am okay with not receiving it back. This way I don't regret, can plan ahead, and prevent room for bitterness to ruin relationships if that money is not paid back. I also don't want to start a tradition I'm not confident to continue for years to come because it\u2019s hard to cut someone off.\n\nWe decided the healthiest way to help is by paying for their monthly phone bills. We also fully fund their flights when we invite them to our house.Tension started when his siblings confronted us. We also like splurging while on vacations. They told us that we are being selfish and not thoughtful of others. To quote exactly, \"We have expensive taste too. We just choose to be more giving by sacrificing our finances\". We also found out that they had been giving my in-laws allowance on a monthly basis.\n\nI feel uncomfortable because they are branding me as the selfish DIL. I now feel guilty booking certain trips because I'm worried about being confronted. If any of our family members were struggling to put food on the table/ on the verge of being homeless I would definitely help out in any way I can. But this situation feels far from that, and that everyone is straining themselves to fund my in-laws' lives. I would never live above my means and expect someone else to pay for it so I don't know why I should. We haven't talked with his sisters and brother in over a year, and I worry that my reluctance is the reason for it. We are only in touch with his parents.\n\nI know I am lucky to not have to worry about my parents. My parents also love gift-giving and give me a lot of nice things. But I feel like my parents and my comfortable financial status is just another reason why they are bitter because they think we are able to but just choose not to.\n\nAITA for the boundaries I set?

It\u2019s not uncommon for Asian parents to give up absolutely everything for their kids when young and expect a significant return when they are grown.

You may be right that their financial support has made it possible for their parents to live beyond their means, and to develop an attitude of being entitled to the support of their children.  If your husband's siblings are struggling, they need to confront their parents and pull back the level of support they are providing.\n\nI think you are very generous to pay for their travel to visit you, and to pay for their monthly phone bill.\n\nYou and your husband are correct to prioritize your financial well-being.  If your in-laws continue to push you to contribute more, tell them you're already doing what you're comfortable doing, and that you will not continue to have the same conversation about supporting your mother- and father-in-law's lifestyle.  Then back it up by ending the conversation the next time it happens.

Culture aside, I can't stand this crazy level of hyper selfish individualism masquerading as collectivism and generosity, and it's so common anymore.\n\nIt's not being selfish to not want to fund your in laws lavish vacations. That's fucking insane. That money can go to 1000 things that are more important, or just saving for your own retirement. How bitter will you be in 30 years when your in laws are long gone, and you don't have enough retirement savings for yourselves, so you then have to ask other people for help or get on the government dole to live out your twilight years?

BUT my family does not have that type of culture, I don't have to deal with your husband's family, and I don't personally give a damn about his parents.", "It's very much a cultural thing. In some Asian cultures, adult children are expected to give their parents a monthly allowance and help take care of them financially once the parents start getting older. It's basically a way of showing gratitude to your parents for the sacrifices they made in raising you and kind of paying them back for putting you through college, etc. I realize it sounds extremely odd to Westerners, but it is very much the norm in some cultures.", "Yes Asian. Edited in post. I understand this is common but my husband's parents did not play into the cultural role. He has been financially independent since turning 18 y/o and never received gifts, private tutoring, having college tuition paid for (and whatever else is commonly done to set children up at your expense as a parent)", "Not here to argue but relaying my frustration regarding this topic -\n\nI was born in the States and have never lived in Asia. Cultural expectations are just another way to excuse toxic commonalities, imo. There are plenty of Asians that don't expect from their children so I don't know why I should be responsible to base the others as the standard. Just because I am Asian?\n\nIf we also want to take that route and account for cultural factors - it is common that Asian parents find themselves in debt to provide secondary educational support. My spouse's parents didn't. So you can't just grab what you want from cultural factors, and plug in only what is convenient for you.", "I\u2019m asian too so providing my two cents. OP sounds like they\u2019re already taking care of them financially though. OP\u2019s point here seems to be being expected to finance what sounds like a very luxurious lifestyle. at a point, it becomes less about culture and more about just being shitty entitled parents", "Ah that would make more sense. I dont agree with that notion but I shouldn't judge another culture that I dont know or understand. I still think the OP is NTA for choosing not to participate in that tradition, especially since their  SO agrees not to.", "Which is okay! Whats not okay is taking advantage of the culture and forcing your kids to put themselves in debt to support your lavish lifestyle", "Wow, defensive much? \n\nI judged NAH--->No Assholes Here. \n\nMy point is that when there are cultural differences in play, then people **in your real life** might be judging you an asshole for bucking those expectations. \n\nThat's the situation you're in, and strangers validating you on the internet wont change anything.", "I definitely agree. My point was just that it's not that odd for the siblings to be supporting the parents and for them to be angry that OP and her husband aren't contributing as much. OP and her husband decided to help by paying for the phone bill and for their flights whenever the parents visit them, which I also feel is more than enough. Just because the other siblings are ok with subsidizing the parents' lavish lifestyle doesn't mean OP and her husband are also obligated to do the same.", "I definitely don't think OP is either. My point was just that it is somewhat expected so in that way it does kind of make sense why the siblings would be angry about OP and her husband not contributing equally. I still feel like OP paying for their phone bill and for their flights to come visit them is more than sufficient. If the siblings want to support them fully and pay for them to constantly fly everywhere, that's their choice. OP and her husband also have the right to choose not to do the same.", "Makes sense! I assume cultural aspect can never be taken out but these aspects didn't affect how they raised him (financially independent when turning legal age, not supporting past basic needs finances during childhood, etc). \n\nthe real people in his life didn't have/care about these cultural expectations when it required them to be the one sacrificing. I can't seem to understand why they feel entitled to cultural expectations all of a sudden, when it comes time for them to be showered with luxuries", "Just like anywhere, traditions can be perverted. Personally,  I'm kind of a fan of the practice. Really wish America was kinder to our elderly."]}
