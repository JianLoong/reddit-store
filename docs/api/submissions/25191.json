In some Asian cultures, adult children are expected to give their parents a monthly allowance and help take care of them financially once the parents start getting older. It's basically a way of showing gratitude to your parents for the sacrifices they made in raising you and kind of paying them back for putting you through college, etc. I realize it sounds extremely odd to Westerners, but it is very much the norm in some cultures.", "Yes Asian. Edited in post. I understand this is common but my husband's parents did not play into the cultural role. He has been financially independent since turning 18 y/o and never received gifts, private tutoring, having college tuition paid for (and whatever else is commonly done to set children up at your expense as a parent)", "Not here to argue but relaying my frustration regarding this topic -\n\nI was born in the States and have never lived in Asia. Cultural expectations are just another way to excuse toxic commonalities, imo. There are plenty of Asians that don't expect from their children so I don't know why I should be responsible to base the others as the standard. Just because I am Asian?\n\nIf we also want to take that route and account for cultural factors - it is common that Asian parents find themselves in debt to provide secondary educational support. My spouse's parents didn't. So you can't just grab what you want from cultural factors, and plug in only what is convenient for you.", "I\u2019m asian too so providing my two cents. OP sounds like they\u2019re already taking care of them financially though. OP\u2019s point here seems to be being expected to finance what sounds like a very luxurious lifestyle. at a point, it becomes less about culture and more about just being shitty entitled parents", "Ah that would make more sense. I dont agree with that notion but I shouldn't judge another culture that I dont know or understand. I still think the OP is NTA for choosing not to participate in that tradition, especially since their  SO agrees not to.", "Which is okay!

My point was just that it's not that odd for the siblings to be supporting the parents and for them to be angry that OP and her husband aren't contributing as much. OP and her husband decided to help by paying for the phone bill and for their flights whenever the parents visit them, which I also feel is more than enough. Just because the other siblings are ok with subsidizing the parents' lavish lifestyle doesn't mean OP and her husband are also obligated to do the same.", "I definitely don't think OP is either. My point was just that it is somewhat expected so in that way it does kind of make sense why the siblings would be angry about OP and her husband not contributing equally.

You failed to mention that it is very common for Asian offspring to give a small token as gratitude. I may not agree with a lot of things in our culture, but you are not being entirely forthcoming here. This is a common cultural practice and the way you skew it to call it financial reliance is disgusting.

I love and respect my culture of taking care of our elderly. I give parents and in laws cash gifts during big holidays and send them on vacations every year. They are extremely grateful and sometimes save our gifts to buy our children toys, etc. Their evident thoughtfulness allows us to continue giving happily. THIS is the norm. Mutual respect, kindness and consideration. The financial give and take follow consequently. The traditional Asian parents find it difficult to spend their children\u2019s hard earned money and would not go on multiple lavish vacations every year. \n\nOP also mentions siblings are strained.

Without having a lot of details, it's easy to make off target sweeping comments.\n\nMy unpopular opinion is also that..cultural norms can be toxic and children can want to break them. If the norm is a strain or problematic, then the choice is upsetting extended family or bringing whatever kind of stress/harm to your own nuclear unit.", "They didn\u2019t play into when it benefited them. Now that the tradition would give them extra money, they want to go all traditional family roles.", "OP says the demanding parents bucked the trend of funding their kids to the point of putting themselves in debt...but seems like they now want to fully embrace the trend of having their kids fund their lives.  So basically they just want all the money.", "I definitely agree with you. Was just pointing out to the other commenter why the siblings seem to be okay with funding their life and why they might be mad that OP and her husband aren't willing to contribute the same. It does seem odd though that the siblings were never upfront with OP's husband that they were funding the parents lifestyle, but then get angry once OP and DH found out and wouldn't suddenly contribute more.", "The post seems to say that the parents went against tradition with not going all out to give the kids absolutely everything (to the point of putting themselves in debt), but now want to fully embrace the tradition of the adult kids funding their lifestyle.  \n\nA good example of wanting to have their cake and eat it to.", "I don't know exactly what I think of the practice if the parents are able to care for themselves financially, but I definitely agree that we should treat our elderly people better. Elder care in this country mostly tends to be piss poor and also extremely expensive. Lots of people also just abandon their elderly parents in nursing homes and never bother to visit or even call. \n\nI have a 90-year-old grandma in a senior living facility and I'm shocked to hear some of the stories she tells. Many of the people who live there haven't had any family visit in years and were basically abandoned the moment they moved in. The place also serves awful food and refuses to hire a nutritionist to plan healthy meals despite having several hundred residents that each pay $4-5k a month for rent. Unfortunately, it is by far the nicest plan in town so there aren't any better options.", "I honestly hadn't even thought about that aspect of it, but you're absolutely right. Extra shitty for the parents to expect it or even ask for money when they didn't go all out for their kids like many Asian parents do. Lots of parents put themselves in massive debt to support their kids and give them every possible chance to be super successful. When that happens, it really only makes sense for the kids to contribute to the parents later on. Seems like none of that happened here and the parents are just being selfish. The siblings are also probably only angry because they didn't have the guts to say no and feel like OP's husband should also be forced into it.", "My SIL does hospice care, and works as a CNA at nursing homes.

OP doesn\u2019t want to subject their own family into debt to support irrational behavior.", "also, if you are relying on others to fund your luxury expenses, that is called financial reliance. just because we are asian, doesn\u2019t make it okay to gaslight our \u201coffspring\u201d to overextending their finances past their comfort level.", "Ok firstly, I don\u2019t have issues with what she is doing, it\u2019s the way she\u2019s misrepresenting this cultural practice. Saying that her in laws are taking advantage but not stating whether or not the kids are doing this voluntarily or being pressured makes me feel that there is some fishy shit going on and she just would rather get strangers hating on her in-laws without sufficient evidence.\n\nI am in my 30s lmao and not relying on anyone to fund myself or my children other than my husband and myself. That\u2019s wild to assume.", "Regardless of the other children doing things voluntarily or not, OP said no. The siblings cut her and husband off because of it. That\u2019s the tension.
