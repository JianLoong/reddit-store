There is nothing wrong with pointing out that certain careers offer a great financial upside; but there's also nothing wrong with pointing out that there's also value in doing something that gives you personal satisfaction and feeds your joy and passion. There's no need to demean someone who earns less that six figures. How do you think you learned enough during grade school to get into good college/post-college programs? You were taught by those very people who you think have valueless careers!!!! Those people cared about teaching the next generation to think, to question, to understand the new, to believe in themselves, to explore the possibilities... I guess your parents are the ones who taught you to have contempt for the 90+% of the world who don't earn well into the six figures... the care-givers, the life-savers (plenty of them do not earn six figures), the artists and writers, the teachers, the public servants, the farmers, the folks who make/assemble the things we all use, the transporters of people and resources, the librarians, the folks who build and repair. Even the ones who do those jobs and use their earnings to help their children have the chance to pursue the professions of *their* dreams. Go tell your parents that you learned their lessons well.", "Yes. YTA.", "Leaning NTA, though I am curious how old your niece is. If she's middle school aged or older, definitely NTA. At at certain point, everyone, but especially young women, need the reality check, re: earning potential, supporting one's self, and how brutal the real world is. BIL is being obtuse AF... I'd also be very happy with a spouse making 10x my salary! He butted in, made an obtuse argument, and you put him in his place. I would too, and my career/salary is far closer to his end of the spectrum than yours. \n\nPeople are reflexively upset about your \"dreams don't matter, follow the money\" advice; and I don't wholeheartedly agree with it, either. But I'm sitting on that end of passion/interest-based, low-paid work and without a wealthy spouse of my own, I've had to make practical, real world choices based on having to financially support myself. Niece will have to face those reality checks, too. Passion is useless if the thing you want to do is high burn out, low paid, and unstable. (see: writing-based careers)\n\nBut... your advice was also rigid and one sided, if practical. BIL was a dingbat about it, but his instinct was to push back against the idea that she HAS to be a doctor when she's clearly expressing misery over it. What about identifying what it is she finds appealing in teaching (it may literally just be \"not medicine\" at this point), and help her explore academic and later career interests that are in-line with what will make her more personally fulfilled/happy? Give her all the tools/information, re: what her lifestyle costs vs. salary ranges for various fields, and let her make her own choices. There's a middle ground. Plenty of careers involve the instinct to teach and mentor that aren't literally teaching in a public school being paid peanuts. She may be able to tap into her own skillsets and enjoy high school, then college, and then her career on her own terms.", "YTA. As another commenter pointed out, where would you be without those teachers and tutors that helped you? We need teachers, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with a dream.

Your niece came and asked you your honest opinion about working in the medical field versus being a teacher and you told her your thoughts. Now I agree with many of the commentators and your BIL that money doesn\u2019t buy happiness but it does give you more opportunities and options in life. In a ideal world one should be able to follow their passion and be paid accordingly but that\u2019s not always the case. In the United States there are many professions like teachers that are very underpaid and often overworked and the reality is most people today can\u2019t afford to buy their own home on one income and often live paycheck to paycheck and struggle for basic things like health insurance and food. \n    I think your BIL is being really naive if he really thinks he or his daughter would have the same quality of life on a $50,000 income. I\u2019m not trying to undermine him as a partner. People contribute and sacrifice in different ways in relationships its not all just finances but when your young&single and deciding on your own career path you should be thinking of the type of lifestyle and quality of life you want to build and if you can afford that on your own without a partner or your parents help because you don\u2019t know the future. Your BIL married someone that makes 10X more than him doesn\u2019t mean your niece will but I also think at this point it\u2019s her life. You told her your thoughts it\u2019s up to her now to decide what\u2019s more of a priority for her and if she will be able to build the lifestyle that she wants. Everyone has different priorities in life. As for your sister and BIL I would maybe apologize for how you said things bc it was very blunt so I get why your BIL was offended or I would just leave it alone, give them time and keep any opinions to yourself going forward. If they really believe that BIL would have the same lifestyle and opportunities without your sister income than that\u2019s their prerogative.", "Absolutely NTA.

But he had to chime in that he lives \"the good life\" which is only the case because of his wife and not because of his career which is the implication. IMO NTA because she was offering genuine advice rather than shutting down the idea immediately and would have likely not said anything if he didn't mention \"the good life\" he lives implying it comes from his salary only. And her comment about not wanting to live off someone else was spot on since that's exactly what went unsaid. Perhaps it could have been delivered in a kinder way so I feel it could be a light ESH from that perspective.", "He probably was alive before his marriage too.", "Yes, yes they were when they advised their neice to not be a teacher because she couldn't live the life she's used to. Money was at the root of OPs advice from the start.", "> The \u201cgood life\u201d that he lives is due to his wife\u2019s salary\n\nNot necessarily. We really don\u2019t know enough about his life before marriage or after marriage to know why he considers his life good, and if it\u2019s because of the money his wife makes or not.", "In what way was he \"not looking out for his niece\"? Do you think every extra dollar you earn confers another mental health point, regardless of what you have to do to get it?", "OP\u2019s BIL makes enough money to support himself without his wife. Yes, he has a lot of benefits because of his wife and her income, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s being disingenuous telling his niece how important being happy is.", "Was just thinking exactly this!", "What are you going on about? His advice wasn't \"be homeless\" . Geez", "You're correct. She still I insulted her BIL for no reason and was telling her niece that she shouldn't pursue her own career path but that of one chosen for her.", "I thought it was his quarter sister.", "a guy who does what he loves *and* manages to pull a rich wife has way more valuable life advice than all of the bloodless dweebs in this thread going \"damn right!! truth hurts!!! N-T-A\"", "And maybe he wouldn\u2019t have cared. If a 125k car matters to him he maybe would have chosen a different career.\n\nHe did something to attract a highly successful woman. I highly doubt it was because he impressed her with an unhappy life", "I outearn my husband, by about 5x. I have a high paying, high profile role but I\u2019m not his sugar mama, and he is not a free loader. We, as partners, made a decision to exist this way. It works for us, and makes both of us happy and if anyone made a comment implying anything to the contrary I\u2019d call them an asshole too. It\u2019s bold as fuck for OP to assume that that his sister and her husband aren\u2019t happy with their lifestyle and that it somehow harms his sister\u2026 seems like she\u2019s made it clear she doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, so yeah, OP is the AH here. He gave very narrow minded advice and then when challenged, targeted someone else\u2019s relationship that he has ZERO authority to speak on. Big time AH, and sounds a little bitter too.", "So by this logic if I earn twice as much as my wife I should roll around in a luxury car and let her drive a clapped out old banger? After all, as you just stated she is not contributing equally.\n\nMarriage is a partnership and you look out for each other and SHARE your life together. You and OP seem to be judging people based solely off their income.", "Wait... If the wife earns more money then she's a sugar mama but if the husband earns more then he's the husband?  If  both are working one spouse makes more, that makes them partners, not sugar mamas/daddys\nAs for him saying he's happy, maybe he was saying he was happy with his career even tho it didnt make as much money as others.", "Thank God someone finally said it out loud.  Do Stay at Home Moms next.", "Not every dollar, but you need to make enough of them to pay your bills and unfortunately in this country teachers do not fall into that category while having an extremely demanding and mentally challenging job. Just keeping it real here.", "Lol. If I married 500k and contributed pretty much no money to the household compared to my expenditure I sure as hell wont be going around talking trash like this. \n\nLol. The only thing BIL can say is that he married for money and being a golddigger is the way to go in life.", "It also wasn\u2019t don\u2019t have a career. He after all could choose to never work a day in his life and be a perfect househusband and doesn\u2019t.\n\nHe still chooses to work\n\nOne of the best marriages in my family involved a teacher and one OP\u2019s job the teacher actually wanted to be a lawyer but she felt that someone needed a less demanding job for their kids.\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible sister picked him for the less demanding career", "Thank you for sharing your experience. \n\nWould OP had reacted the same if the genders were reversed? The BIL (as far as we know) isn\u2019t a freeloader and has a paying job. His sister chose to marry him and chose to gift him his electric expensive car.\n\nIs OP disregarding his sister\u2019s choices? Is a man that makes less than his wife, a freeloader? Would we judge a wife who makes less than her husband with the same standard? It\u2019s not right. If there is to be gender equality then it needs to be so in this respect as well. \n\nI\u2019m a woman and frankly the attitude I see from many that the man has to be the main provider or the sole earner is anachronistic. \n\nIf BIL is a good husband. If he makes OP\u2019s sister happy and does his share in the household chores and financial obligations, then what does it matter how much he makes? Would OP prefer if his sister had married a rich lawyer or surgeon that was a dick to her? \n\nMainly, what I want to know is BIL a good husband? Because if he is, then that\u2019s all that should matter.", "<<*assume that that his sister and her husband aren\u2019t happy with their lifestyle*\\>>\n\nI don't think OP has said that sister or husband are  unhappy, just that BIL wouldn't necessarily be able to afford to live his dream life/job without the substantial assistance of his wife's income.  \n\nAnd it is realistic for OP to say that a teacher's income rarely let's them live the \"good life\"/dream.  Being a teacher right now is pretty unbearable with the expectations put on a teacher and the insane guidelines they need to follow, the pitiful pay for the amount of education they need to get.", "As the partner making 10x less and spending double his annual salary on a car, he has absolutely no right to mislead a kid regarding what their lifestyle expectations can be depending on different jobs.", "NOPE. You spend what you earn, marriage or not. You live respectful lives and not abuse your SO's money. If the genders were reversed, exact same response. Thank god there is some sense in AITA. \n\nSomeone making 50k and driving a 125k car AND having the nerve to mislead a child and we have redditors here bigging him up.", "Where I am right now (South East Asia), if the parents don't give 'permission' for the marriage, the couple won't be fully accepted by their community and every misfortune that befalls them is because they got married without their parents 'permission'. If the parents gave 'permission' it's a given their blessings were also given.", "Why are you pretending that golddigging females do not exist? Dont be a sexist. \n\nAnd just because they exist does not give BIL a free pass.", "Who said he did? Also, didn\u2019t we hear from OP that the vehicle was a Christmas gift? You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about his motives\u2026 you have no idea what kind of emotional, physical, and mental labour he contributes to his partnership. BIL simply said money doesn\u2019t equal happiness, and that she should follow her dreams. Perhaps if he had been allowed to finish his thoughts he would have said more, but we don\u2019t know because OP got lost in his feelings and couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.", "That\u2019s a tough situation to be in honestly.", "It makes things difficult. One example is that the culture is different in that the family is the most important thing so babysitters outside of working hours is basically non-existant. Going out for date nights is impossible if you don't have family willing to babysit. And good luck finding someone willing to take care of a sick kid without having to pay extra. \n\nA lot of young professionals become weekend parents where their parents raise their kids and they'll 'visit' them on the weekends or when they take leave. It's supposedly to make it easier of the parents so they can focus on their career (Asian working hours and work ethic) so when the kids enter school, the kids 'move back in' with the parents as they both should be economically stable."]}
