At the same time, pushing a child to pursue medicine when they are not passionate or mentally suited for the career is a bad idea. While teachers often do not pay well, it is still a valid career choice that your niece could take. A better idea would be to say that she can do it but she has to adjust to a different life or find another career that she is passionate about that pays better.  \nI'm Asian as well, I understand the importance of education but I also understand the value of  pursuing a career in something that they actually care about. It does not always end with misery or \"living off of someone else\" as you implied.

There is nothing wrong with pointing out that certain careers offer a great financial upside; but there's also nothing wrong with pointing out that there's also value in doing something that gives you personal satisfaction and feeds your joy and passion. There's no need to demean someone who earns less that six figures. How do you think you learned enough during grade school to get into good college/post-college programs? You were taught by those very people who you think have valueless careers!!!! Those people cared about teaching the next generation to think, to question, to understand the new, to believe in themselves, to explore the possibilities... I guess your parents are the ones who taught you to have contempt for the 90+% of the world who don't earn well into the six figures... the care-givers, the life-savers (plenty of them do not earn six figures), the artists and writers, the teachers, the public servants, the farmers, the folks who make/assemble the things we all use, the transporters of people and resources, the librarians, the folks who build and repair. Even the ones who do those jobs and use their earnings to help their children have the chance to pursue the professions of *their* dreams. Go tell your parents that you learned their lessons well.", "Yes. YTA.", "Leaning NTA, though I am curious how old your niece is. If she's middle school aged or older, definitely NTA. At at certain point, everyone, but especially young women, need the reality check, re: earning potential, supporting one's self, and how brutal the real world is. BIL is being obtuse AF... I'd also be very happy with a spouse making 10x my salary! He butted in, made an obtuse argument, and you put him in his place. I would too, and my career/salary is far closer to his end of the spectrum than yours. \n\nPeople are reflexively upset about your \"dreams don't matter, follow the money\" advice; and I don't wholeheartedly agree with it, either. But I'm sitting on that end of passion/interest-based, low-paid work and without a wealthy spouse of my own, I've had to make practical, real world choices based on having to financially support myself. Niece will have to face those reality checks, too. Passion is useless if the thing you want to do is high burn out, low paid, and unstable. (see: writing-based careers)\n\nBut... your advice was also rigid and one sided, if practical. BIL was a dingbat about it, but his instinct was to push back against the idea that she HAS to be a doctor when she's clearly expressing misery over it. What about identifying what it is she finds appealing in teaching (it may literally just be \"not medicine\" at this point), and help her explore academic and later career interests that are in-line with what will make her more personally fulfilled/happy? Give her all the tools/information, re: what her lifestyle costs vs. salary ranges for various fields, and let her make her own choices. There's a middle ground. Plenty of careers involve the instinct to teach and mentor that aren't literally teaching in a public school being paid peanuts. She may be able to tap into her own skillsets and enjoy high school, then college, and then her career on her own terms.", "YTA. As another commenter pointed out, where would you be without those teachers and tutors that helped you? We need teachers, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with a dream.

Your niece came and asked you your honest opinion about working in the medical field versus being a teacher and you told her your thoughts. Now I agree with many of the commentators and your BIL that money doesn\u2019t buy happiness but it does give you more opportunities and options in life. In a ideal world one should be able to follow their passion and be paid accordingly but that\u2019s not always the case. In the United States there are many professions like teachers that are very underpaid and often overworked and the reality is most people today can\u2019t afford to buy their own home on one income and often live paycheck to paycheck and struggle for basic things like health insurance and food. \n    I think your BIL is being really naive if he really thinks he or his daughter would have the same quality of life on a $50,000 income. I\u2019m not trying to undermine him as a partner. People contribute and sacrifice in different ways in relationships its not all just finances but when your young&single and deciding on your own career path you should be thinking of the type of lifestyle and quality of life you want to build and if you can afford that on your own without a partner or your parents help because you don\u2019t know the future. Your BIL married someone that makes 10X more than him doesn\u2019t mean your niece will but I also think at this point it\u2019s her life. You told her your thoughts it\u2019s up to her now to decide what\u2019s more of a priority for her and if she will be able to build the lifestyle that she wants. Everyone has different priorities in life. As for your sister and BIL I would maybe apologize for how you said things bc it was very blunt so I get why your BIL was offended or I would just leave it alone, give them time and keep any opinions to yourself going forward. If they really believe that BIL would have the same lifestyle and opportunities without your sister income than that\u2019s their prerogative.", "Absolutely NTA. Your BIL was hurt you pointed out the truth. You're giving your niece an honest and unbiased view of the kind of life she will lead depending on her career choices.

Maybe BIL would have been happy with a used Corolla and his wife just wanted to give him a fancy present because she loves him and felt like it, we don't know because that isn't the point.\n\nThat said, I do think BIL is leaving out crucial information to niece. When I was in school, whenever I wanted to choose a profession, my father always explained to me the pros and cons. For example, I wanted to go into live theatre for a while, and my dad explained that if it would make me happy I should, but that it was a difficult life and often people who worked in it had to share very small apartments and had very high expenses, and/or lived on the road, and also had to take very good and careful care of their voices/physical health. He didn't ever say, \"No, do something that makes lots of money,\" but he didn't ever just simply say, \"Do something you love,\" either, because it isn't that simple. I ended up as a nonprofit accountant who does a lot of community theatre, so I get both the ability to pay my bills AND I get to chase my passion.\n\nYou absolutely shouldn't be miserable in your work, but you absolutely should consider the standard of life you want and whether what you're chasing can provide it. \n\nI would need more info to determine a judgement, because if BIL means that his high standard of living is \"the good life,\" he is something of an A for not explaining further that he wouldn't be able to afford those things without his wife's income, but OP is definitely something of an A for assuming that's what he meant, and for assuming he is \"living off\" her sister, rather than assuming they have come to a mutual agreement in a happy marriage (which it seems they have, since sister is defending him). There's nothing wrong with having a partner who provides the opportunity for you to chase your passion as long as they aren't unhappy with doing so, but there's also nothing wrong with telling someone, \"Hey, if you WANT a Tesla or you'll be miserable with the thermostat at 78 in summertime, take it into consideration.\"", "You\u2026 are a very little person.", "This is a conversation my parents had with me.

OP then pointed out that he's actually very wealthy, and is *not* actually living on a lower middle class income, reinforcing to the niece that, whatever choices she makes, she'll need to be realistic about what those choices will mean for her adult life.\n\nI believe OP is NTA, and all these comments arguing about whether or not BIL is a \"sugar baby\" or \"freeloader\" are not just insulting, but a distraction. What this boils down to is that BIL is a very wealthy man who is doing the typical wealthy person thing of downplaying his own privilege and the massive leg up it's given him in life, which means his advice to his and OP's niece was misleading. \"You can make a low salary and still have a happy and fulfilling life\" is good advice, but \"you can make a low salary and still be totally comfortable and not stress about money, as I, a very wealthy man, illustrate\" is very bad advice to give a naive kid.", "Right??

Medicine may be a stressful career but what a lot of people aren\u2019t paying attention is that teaching can be equally as stressful. The amount of unpaid overtime teachers have to work is insane.

However, you could've told your niece that his viewpoint was based off him having a wealthier spouse without saying it to his face to embarrass him. You deliberately shamed him and that makes you TAH. You could've politely, but firmly, told him that YOU were having a PRIVATE conversation with your niece and asked him to butt out. Sure, he still would've been embarrassed, but he wouldn't have felt his entire life was judged and that you thought less of him as a person, because he has a lower salary. (I'm not saying that you actually think less of him, but rather that's probably how it felt when you said that to his face.) You definitely could've handled this more diplomatically, but your irritation at being interrupted is fully understandable.  Some of this may just be a cultural difference, though, in most cultures it's rude to butt in and interrupt a conversation.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA you were telling the truth, your niece can't keep up her lifestyle on a teachers salary.

NAH. \n\nYes, I have my own bias as my family is Bangladeshi and my parents immigrated to the US & emphasized the importance of education.\n\nBIL is partially right. Money does not always equate to happiness. However, having more money means you can secure more happiness than having less money. You can still have happiness doing what you love even if you don't earn as much (compared to making more doing what you don't love) as long as you are willing to adjust your life style. \n\nQuestion then becomes - will your niece be willing to significantly adjust her life style for happiness and passion? Or does your niece enjoy what she currently has and wants to keep it that way? It's difficult to adjust but it is doable.\n\nNow then onto you. You are correct. While BIL lives a great life as a chef (which is VERY difficult to do), a huge part of that is due to marrying your sister. But, I assume he also contributes to his family unit, so he's not completely living off his wife's salary.

That doesn't make him a freeloader since he's working and maybe they share house responsibilities, but that's not the point.\n\nThe point is he is giving a deluded advice about \"living well\" with just his \"50k\" salary so she would do fine too with a teacher salary, when in reality he is not living off a good life out of that 50k salary.\n\nSo if niece follows advice and goes for teacher and find herself in a position where she cannot afford the same lifestyle her parents gave her or her cousins have, she will feel frustrated and Maybe a failure.\n\nShe might not, she might find other things to enjoy and maybe her parents will help her maintain the lifestyle she had, but then again the failure feeling might still be there, or maybe she will break free from the high earning lifestyle and enjoy a more modest lifestyle, but being serious I don't think that easily happens when you come from a high earning income household.\n\nTLDR: don't give unwanted financial/education advices to teenagers based on deluded believes that your meager salary is enough when you have the backup of a partner that makes 10x your salary", "I will preface this by saying that I think your response to your niece was reasonable and truthful if it actually was stated in the way that you wrote it. Realistically, she will have a different standard of living than what she's used to right now, and that is important to consider. However, I'm having a hard time believing it was that cut and dry of a conversation.\n\nRegardless, YTA just for the fact that you obviously look down on those who make less money than you. Your BIL's life didn't start when he met your sister. He very well could enjoy being a chef and had enjoyed his life before meeting your sister, but you're the one projecting your definition of happiness onto him and assuming he considers his wife's money what brings him happiness.\n\nMoney can fix a lot of problems, sure. But your attitude (and I assume the attitude of the rest of your family) regarding money being the forefront of a comfortable, happy life and shaming him for his career isn't going to bring happiness to anyone. If your niece decides she wants to be a teacher anyway, how many snide comments are you going to make at her expense in the future for her choice and money situation? \n\nNot to mention that if she wanted to, she could continue school later and become something else, if not get a specialized PHD and become a professor which can also make good money. Instead of shooting down her desires and dismissing them, you could have helped her explore her options, which don't just include being a teacher \"on the side.\" Just because you've made peace with being resentful and miserable as a kid doesn't mean she or any other kids in the family should have to go through the same thing. You may be satisfied now, but that doesn't mean it's a healthy way to live. \n\nAdditionally, being overtly rude to your BIL about his career is just assholeish in general. Just because he gave the perspective that she can find happiness outside of money doesn't mean you should ridicule him for his lack thereof, especially because he's right too. She could hate being in the medical field, hate what she does daily, feel pressured not to stop, and live depressed and unfulfilled. But don't worry, she has an expensive mortgage and a 202X car to show her happiness for her.\n\nI also think you just have some harboring resentment towards Bill, whether that be because of his race, his job, or his upbringing/way of life. Sometimes, these things are unconscious, but I think based on how you reacted to him and the way you write about him, it's obvious you don't like him either way.

He's probably depressed and has developed some anxiety disorder (he won't get a diagnosis) but he just tries to ignore it because studying is more important. His scores are stellar, best in every class, and he's still not satisfied. He never feels like he's studied enough, not even when he inevitably aces the test. He's way too self critical, won't allow himself any praise. I get seriously worried for him at times but he refuses help, he thinks he's fine. His career will certainly be splendid, but I can't say if that will make for a good life. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, there's me: I had generally good grades growing up, but I was never pressured into it. In high school I almost flunked physics one year, and my parents were nothing but supportive (they helped me find a tutor but did not threaten to take away games or sports if I kept failing), and when I was too stressed to choose a university they let me take a gap year (ofc, I had small side jobs) before going back to school. \n\n\n\nI have now graduated both my bachelor's and master's degree with good grades. If I had been forced to go to university during my gap year, it would have broke me. I was way too stressed and overwhelmed (with undiagnosed ADHD that I didn't know at the time) to continue piling on, I'm sure my grades would have suffered and my mental health would have been in shambles: those months of break allowed me to recharge my batteries in order to tackle on the next big obstacle without being ran over by it. I don't know where I'll end up career-wise, but I am already in a much better place than I would have been if I had not been allowed to take a step back.

Good job telling your niece the truth &, since BIL involved himself, you have every right to use him as a example. \n\nSecond, what you said is true & your niece deserves to be prepared for the realities + what it takes to maintain her current life style. Now, if she later decides to sacrifice lifestyle for a preferred career as a teacher (I recommend against it btw!), then that will be her decision and she needs to understand what that life is really like. I left teaching even though I loved it because the pay doesn\u2019t reflect the actual work involved + society at large is devaluing educators more & more. I am able to comfortably privately tutor as I make a career change, but the truth is you don\u2019t start off as a tutor making over $25/hr without advanced degrees + years (6+) in the classroom. That, and teaching has severe problems that lead to people leaving in droves, even though it is a valuable skill set (management, flexibility, leadership, real world connections, design, etc) and important to society. \n\nThird, too often parents in the West tend towards prioritizing what kids enjoy instead of preparing them for the realities, & the truth is a high-paying career where you are financially secure is really important for freedom, especially for women. You need to have that discussion with her also. \n\nSome of my (girl) friends & I have discussed this & the general consensus is that we would have preferred to be raised with more emphasis on the reality of the world as women & the importance of competitive education to achieve a safe & free lifestyle. Unfortunately, or fortunately, more $ means more freedom & for women, being able to make that money is better than depending on a partner. Examples: Married bff has had to deal with her husband being breadwinner & using $ as a control tactic without him even realizing he was doing it & how entitled he behaved towards her & putting demands on her that just weren\u2019t realistic.  Second bff had her life destroyed by a man through financial abuse. My ex started making serious money after I helped him with his career. He started with nothing & turned on me so fast saying & doing some of the most disgusting and hurtful things me & my friends never expected from someone who was so kind before. Each of these three men have different backgrounds also: 1 SE Asian wealthy family background, 1 white American middle class, well-educated background & 1 Mexican working-middle class, high school educated background. Seems these men lose their minds when/if they start making serious money & the women involved are paying for it. (Surely, it can happen both ways, but I\u2019m using my personal experiences in which none of my girl friends executed such control as their careers progressed). This needs to be discussed with our youth imo. \n\nFinally, the boomer men who I\u2019ve heard say \u201cdo what you love & you never work a day\u201d \ud83d\ude44(a common phrase from many boomers I grew up around) come from a good place when saying that, & likely imbedded in our generation, which may be where your BIL gets that mindset from. \n\nWhat BIL doesn\u2019t realize is that mindset is from a place of privilege that boomers grew up with, specifically older, straight, white men & it seems to still work for that same demographic sometimes. That mindset comes from a time when families could expect to comfortably live on one salary, stick with one company for a safe retirement, & have access to affordable (tuition-capped) education. All of which no longer exist for average people & never fully existed for women. Boomer women I had around me quietly emphasized the importance of at least a practical education. \n\nWith that said, banning all extracurriculars that don\u2019t benefit competitive education sounds stifling. Room for one \u201cfun\u201d extracurricular (or to let the child explore interests) & one-two serious extras plus tutoring shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem barring costs imo. Especially if the child keeps grades up.", "You didn\u2019t need to take a dig at your BIL, but I\u2019m still going with NTA. It\u2019s truly unfortunate that in some countries (I\u2019m not American) teaching is not a job that pays well. It should pay high-five or low-six figures and be regarded as an investment in the the future of our society.

OP is NTA for explaining this to her niece and her BIL shouldn\u2019t have imposed unless his opinion was directly asked. You can be happy with a lower paying job but it\u2019s also hard when you\u2019re in between paychecks. BIL is in fact having his life subsidized by his wife and while it\u2019s rude to be pointed out, he decided to intervene in a conversation that did not involve him.

I can almost guarantee OP was asked to tell niece's about all the advantages of pursuing a career in this field. OP clearly likes the career path they took and was sharing their their experiences. \nI've been asked to do the same many times by family friends - sometimes the kid is like \"hey cool I can do this for financial security and pursue my passions on the side that's awesome\" other times they decide they have something that they are really passionate about and pursue that. There is nothing pushy about encouraging a path that you feel is a good one (especially since the niece's parents agree). BIL was sticking his nose where it didn't belong.\n\nAlso nothing bad about parents wanting their kids to go into a certain career. There is absolutely nothing in the narrative provided that points to the parents forcing her into a certain career or not letting her pursue other interests. It seems like they just want to encourage her into a secure and well paying field. \n\nOP's comment to BIL was rude but honestly an adult getting so upset about a true statement to the point where OP's sister is demanding an apology is kind of childish in my opinion.

But the point was I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER. POINT BLANK. PERIOD. Not a special ed teacher (more money, easier to get hired) and not an elementary teacher (shorter, cheaper degree). I picked a life that would be rewarding and fulfilling to me. Just like BIL was able to follow his dreams and be happy in his position...a chef, not a fucking leech.

I broke up with a guy that wanted to be a doctor and already felt better than me while we were both in school. \n\nMoney is nice, but you can't buy purpose. You can't buy fulfillment.
