While teachers often do not pay well, it is still a valid career choice that your niece could take. A better idea would be to say that she can do it but she has to adjust to a different life or find another career that she is passionate about that pays better.  \nI'm Asian as well, I understand the importance of education but I also understand the value of  pursuing a career in something that they actually care about. It does not always end with misery or \"living off of someone else\" as you implied.

There is nothing wrong with pointing out that certain careers offer a great financial upside; but there's also nothing wrong with pointing out that there's also value in doing something that gives you personal satisfaction and feeds your joy and passion. There's no need to demean someone who earns less that six figures. How do you think you learned enough during grade school to get into good college/post-college programs? You were taught by those very people who you think have valueless careers!!!! Those people cared about teaching the next generation to think, to question, to understand the new, to believe in themselves, to explore the possibilities... I guess your parents are the ones who taught you to have contempt for the 90+% of the world who don't earn well into the six figures... the care-givers, the life-savers (plenty of them do not earn six figures), the artists and writers, the teachers, the public servants, the farmers, the folks who make/assemble the things we all use, the transporters of people and resources, the librarians, the folks who build and repair. Even the ones who do those jobs and use their earnings to help their children have the chance to pursue the professions of *their* dreams. Go tell your parents that you learned their lessons well.", "Yes. YTA.", "Leaning NTA, though I am curious how old your niece is. If she's middle school aged or older, definitely NTA. At at certain point, everyone, but especially young women, need the reality check, re: earning potential, supporting one's self, and how brutal the real world is. BIL is being obtuse AF... I'd also be very happy with a spouse making 10x my salary! He butted in, made an obtuse argument, and you put him in his place. I would too, and my career/salary is far closer to his end of the spectrum than yours. \n\nPeople are reflexively upset about your \"dreams don't matter, follow the money\" advice; and I don't wholeheartedly agree with it, either. But I'm sitting on that end of passion/interest-based, low-paid work and without a wealthy spouse of my own, I've had to make practical, real world choices based on having to financially support myself. Niece will have to face those reality checks, too. Passion is useless if the thing you want to do is high burn out, low paid, and unstable. (see: writing-based careers)\n\nBut... your advice was also rigid and one sided, if practical. BIL was a dingbat about it, but his instinct was to push back against the idea that she HAS to be a doctor when she's clearly expressing misery over it. What about identifying what it is she finds appealing in teaching (it may literally just be \"not medicine\" at this point), and help her explore academic and later career interests that are in-line with what will make her more personally fulfilled/happy? Give her all the tools/information, re: what her lifestyle costs vs. salary ranges for various fields, and let her make her own choices. There's a middle ground. Plenty of careers involve the instinct to teach and mentor that aren't literally teaching in a public school being paid peanuts. She may be able to tap into her own skillsets and enjoy high school, then college, and then her career on her own terms.", "YTA. As another commenter pointed out, where would you be without those teachers and tutors that helped you? We need teachers, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with a dream.

I mean you know she's his kid and not yours, right?\n\nSo YTA.", "NTA. You probably could of left that last part out lol but I don\u2019t think your wrong here. Your niece came and asked you your honest opinion about working in the medical field versus being a teacher and you told her your thoughts. Now I agree with many of the commentators and your BIL that money doesn\u2019t buy happiness but it does give you more opportunities and options in life. In a ideal world one should be able to follow their passion and be paid accordingly but that\u2019s not always the case. In the United States there are many professions like teachers that are very underpaid and often overworked and the reality is most people today can\u2019t afford to buy their own home on one income and often live paycheck to paycheck and struggle for basic things like health insurance and food. \n    I think your BIL is being really naive if he really thinks he or his daughter would have the same quality of life on a $50,000 income. I\u2019m not trying to undermine him as a partner. People contribute and sacrifice in different ways in relationships its not all just finances but when your young&single and deciding on your own career path you should be thinking of the type of lifestyle and quality of life you want to build and if you can afford that on your own without a partner or your parents help because you don\u2019t know the future. Your BIL married someone that makes 10X more than him doesn\u2019t mean your niece will but I also think at this point it\u2019s her life. You told her your thoughts it\u2019s up to her now to decide what\u2019s more of a priority for her and if she will be able to build the lifestyle that she wants. Everyone has different priorities in life. As for your sister and BIL I would maybe apologize for how you said things bc it was very blunt so I get why your BIL was offended or I would just leave it alone, give them time and keep any opinions to yourself going forward. If they really believe that BIL would have the same lifestyle and opportunities without your sister income than that\u2019s their prerogative.", "Absolutely NTA. Your BIL was hurt you pointed out the truth. You're giving your niece an honest and unbiased view of the kind of life she will lead depending on her career choices.

But it could have been phrased a bit like less of an attack, and more of a reminder that his income alone doesn't support him, and that if she is going to be a teacher she needs to think of how she wants to live and with whom and how much she also wants to be an advocate for her job and the system to be a single income household able to live, or a multiple income household.", "Info do you miss your child hood and not being able to play with your friends?

Maybe it is and calling it a gift is their way of justifying the costs. When I was gifted a car it wasn't to \"support my lifestyle\" but to improve my quality of life, so I guess I am a bit bias. \n\nRegardless, saying that BIL is living off of his wife is rude.

Of course she could still find happiness at this income level, but it would mean a different life than what she's used to.\n\nBIL jumping in at that point to essentially say, \"nonsense! I have a lower middle class salary and still have a comfortable life!\" is misleading, *because* his household is extremely wealthy thanks to his wife.
