There is nothing wrong with pointing out that certain careers offer a great financial upside; but there's also nothing wrong with pointing out that there's also value in doing something that gives you personal satisfaction and feeds your joy and passion. There's no need to demean someone who earns less that six figures. How do you think you learned enough during grade school to get into good college/post-college programs? You were taught by those very people who you think have valueless careers!!!! Those people cared about teaching the next generation to think, to question, to understand the new, to believe in themselves, to explore the possibilities... I guess your parents are the ones who taught you to have contempt for the 90+% of the world who don't earn well into the six figures... the care-givers, the life-savers (plenty of them do not earn six figures), the artists and writers, the teachers, the public servants, the farmers, the folks who make/assemble the things we all use, the transporters of people and resources, the librarians, the folks who build and repair. Even the ones who do those jobs and use their earnings to help their children have the chance to pursue the professions of *their* dreams. Go tell your parents that you learned their lessons well.", "Yes. YTA.", "Leaning NTA, though I am curious how old your niece is. If she's middle school aged or older, definitely NTA. At at certain point, everyone, but especially young women, need the reality check, re: earning potential, supporting one's self, and how brutal the real world is. BIL is being obtuse AF... I'd also be very happy with a spouse making 10x my salary! He butted in, made an obtuse argument, and you put him in his place. I would too, and my career/salary is far closer to his end of the spectrum than yours. \n\nPeople are reflexively upset about your \"dreams don't matter, follow the money\" advice; and I don't wholeheartedly agree with it, either. But I'm sitting on that end of passion/interest-based, low-paid work and without a wealthy spouse of my own, I've had to make practical, real world choices based on having to financially support myself. Niece will have to face those reality checks, too. Passion is useless if the thing you want to do is high burn out, low paid, and unstable. (see: writing-based careers)\n\nBut... your advice was also rigid and one sided, if practical. BIL was a dingbat about it, but his instinct was to push back against the idea that she HAS to be a doctor when she's clearly expressing misery over it. What about identifying what it is she finds appealing in teaching (it may literally just be \"not medicine\" at this point), and help her explore academic and later career interests that are in-line with what will make her more personally fulfilled/happy? Give her all the tools/information, re: what her lifestyle costs vs. salary ranges for various fields, and let her make her own choices. There's a middle ground. Plenty of careers involve the instinct to teach and mentor that aren't literally teaching in a public school being paid peanuts. She may be able to tap into her own skillsets and enjoy high school, then college, and then her career on her own terms.", "YTA. As another commenter pointed out, where would you be without those teachers and tutors that helped you? We need teachers, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with a dream.

Your niece came and asked you your honest opinion about working in the medical field versus being a teacher and you told her your thoughts. Now I agree with many of the commentators and your BIL that money doesn\u2019t buy happiness but it does give you more opportunities and options in life. In a ideal world one should be able to follow their passion and be paid accordingly but that\u2019s not always the case. In the United States there are many professions like teachers that are very underpaid and often overworked and the reality is most people today can\u2019t afford to buy their own home on one income and often live paycheck to paycheck and struggle for basic things like health insurance and food. \n    I think your BIL is being really naive if he really thinks he or his daughter would have the same quality of life on a $50,000 income. I\u2019m not trying to undermine him as a partner. People contribute and sacrifice in different ways in relationships its not all just finances but when your young&single and deciding on your own career path you should be thinking of the type of lifestyle and quality of life you want to build and if you can afford that on your own without a partner or your parents help because you don\u2019t know the future. Your BIL married someone that makes 10X more than him doesn\u2019t mean your niece will but I also think at this point it\u2019s her life. You told her your thoughts it\u2019s up to her now to decide what\u2019s more of a priority for her and if she will be able to build the lifestyle that she wants. Everyone has different priorities in life. As for your sister and BIL I would maybe apologize for how you said things bc it was very blunt so I get why your BIL was offended or I would just leave it alone, give them time and keep any opinions to yourself going forward. If they really believe that BIL would have the same lifestyle and opportunities without your sister income than that\u2019s their prerogative.", "Absolutely NTA.

The parents don't have to allow anything once sister hits 18", "\"Allow the marriage\"?", "Yet he's benefitting from someone who's making a lot of money.", "YTA and OP sounds like a judgmental jerk. He\u2019s not a deadbeat he has a respectable job.", "I don't really think a spouse that makes less money than their partner is a \"loser\".\n\nI know women who have married a man who makes much more money than her but she is not a \"loser\". I think it is possible for a couple to have a relationship where one of them makes less or has agreed to stay home as a full-time parent and still be a great romantic partner.\n\nNo one blinks an eye when a woman decides marry a rich guy but when the genders are reversed everyone loses their minds", "I wish I had read this before I took the time to respond to your nonsense on my post. It would have confirmed your troll status.", "So everyone who marries someone who makes considerably more money than they do are all gold diggers\u2026?", "I was with you until you called the BIL a gold digger. He may be, he may not be; we don\u2019t have enough information to judge him. He is, IMO, naive. To him, money doesn\u2019t equal happiness bc he gets the freedom to work a job he loves and the benefit of a luxurious life bc his partner treats him as an equal. But niece def needs to know that while she may find teaching very rewarding, she won\u2019t have the kind of financial freedom her parents have. That is, unless she marries someone who earns a high salary and treats her like a partner- as BILs spouse does for him.", "I have. And pointing out the hypocrisy is not being on a high horse. And, if you insist it is, then giddy up.", "Exactly! People on here are bugging! It's clear that many calling OP an asshole are those who fail to accomplish a lot in life and so they're salty that OP told the truth. Or maybe they are just like the BIL.", "This isn't \"Was I technically truthful?\" This is \"Am I the Asshole?\" And while OP *may* have been truthful (as far as they are aware), they were absolutely an AH. \n\nOP's definition of \"the good life\" (and yours too, apparently) is based on extremely narrow parameters. Which is fine, if it works for you, then it works for you.\n\nBut just because that is *your* definition doesn't mean it is the *only* definition. It takes quite a bit of chutzpah to assume that he \"wasn't looking out for his niece,\" just because his advice differs from yours.\n\nAnd even using your definition, I would absolutely not encourage anyone to go into the medical profession right now: higher education costs are up, potential salaries are down, job satisfaction is down as doctors spend more and more of their time complying with insurance/government regulations unless time working with patients... The math is very different than it was a mere ten years ago.", "I agree. I don\u2019t understand the YTA judgements here. Fact: he is not contributing equally, not anything near enough to 50/50. But drives a car that\u2019s worth more than double his salary? How could he do that without his rich sugar mama high earning wife.", "We\u2019ll never know.", "Yes I understand. Perhaps allowing is the wrong wording, I mean like give their parental blessing to\u2026", "From what I understand with my family members, Vietnamese parents and Asian parents in general: Indian, Chinese, Korean\u2026 they have a say in who their kids marry and can give blessings or not\u2026 the fact that they are supportive and allowed the marriage and accept him into their home rather than being standoffish is unusual given their differences and difference of circumstance\u2026", "90% or 100%? Were you fired or did you go from making half a mil to 50k? If you say you did and everything is fine you\u2019re either a liar or had enough saved that you were good anyway.\n\nAlso the fact that our society undervalues and underpays teachers doesn\u2019t make the OP a hypocrite in anyway. She didn\u2019t set salaries for careers.", "I disagree. He could probably make more than 50k if he wanted and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he takes a lesser role in order so that his wife could make more as a partner.\n\nThe man can support himself and a man who cooks is attractive. If he can attract a woman like OP sister he probably could have attracted someone else.\n\nWhile he\u2019s he has nicer things it doesn\u2019t mean he is helpless", "Giving a blessing is entirely different from allowing. Allowing would indicate that person requires their parent's permission versus being able to get married whether they had it or not.", "My husband and I both lost our jobs because of the recession. We had 2 little kids, lost our house, all of it. Because of the educations teachers gave us, we were able to build back. It took a long time but we did it and still didn't decide that money is the most important thing. Money doesn't equal happiness, loyalty, or meaningful relationships.\n\nThings can be lost or taken from you, no matter how many things you have. OP denigrates teaching because it doesn't pay as well as being a surgeon. Without teachers there would be no surgeons, at any paycheck.\n\nHappy Boxing Day.", "Your entire comment is based on hypotheticals. I\u2019m dealing with the reality.", "Yea true but understand that some people, me included, grew up in circumstances that when parents don\u2019t give permission out right, or certain preferences are known- it\u2019s just assumed they either do or don\u2019t or won\u2019t allow it\u2026 typically the choices are follow the parents wishes or be cut off. So their allowance and acceptance are awesome and rather unique imo", "What is the percentage difference between your current job salaries and your old job salaries? I feel like you continue proving me right and refusing to understand what I\u2019m even saying.\n\nEspecially with kids, would you really accept a 90% pay cut when looking for a new job after getting fired?", "Reality is the guy did something to attract a woman making 500k a year.\n\nMen who can cook are attractive. Teachers do get married all the time and manage decent lives.\n\nDo I think he would have the kind of lifestyle he has now no.  But he could probably get another spouse and with another income earner do okay", "I'll go out on a limb and say you are a 15 year old kid who identifies as a \"sigma\". Grow up", "There\u2019s no getting through to this sense moron!! I agree with you. OP was responding to BIL\u2019s comment of him living a good life (which is due to his wife\u2019s salary, not his own). Nowhere in there was OP denigrating teachers or BIL upholding their value to society. It was just OP correcting BIL\u2019s incorrect statement."]}
