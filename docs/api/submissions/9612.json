Sports teams are an irrelevant point and shouldn\u2019t even be brought into this since there are plenty of sports clubs with mixed sex/gender social sports teams for those who want it + men only teams and women only teams (not everyone wants to be in mixed teams as well, esp for contact sports).

If your safe space is actually only excluding those socially \u201cbeneath\u201d you, then that exclusion is inherently oppressive and one can only figure that space is being utilized to give men the freedom to be misogynist, because why else would they feel wholly unsafe around women?\n\nApologies for my hostility in the beginning, unless of course you are trolling, then I meant that shit.", "Here's the difference for me.

But the difference is that it's advertised and organized events, and I really can't see the problem with that. If this dude wants a night with lads only, he should try to make it an organized event.", "Exactly, why is he advocating for a guy who\u2019s trying to exclude her? Unless the bar explicitly stated \u201cmen\u2019s only trivia night\u201d, both these sexists don\u2019t have a leg to stand on.", "If you aren't paying for a product, you are the product, after all. Same for ladies' nights events- a price reduction has to provide benefit for a business somewhere.", "Especially on Fridays", "Some jurisdictions also don't allow for happy hours. Both of those are more related to preventing over consumption and public safety than sexism.", "On a friday night? Come on, in a little town sure, on a Tuesday or something. But on Fridays and Saturdays? the busiest days for all bars?", "Probably because the Huns had female warriors, so to Shan Yu Mulan being a woman and a warrior was probably not that big a deal lol", "Shan Yu didn\u2019t have a mantrum when he realized Mulan was a woman, he said \u201cthe soldier.\u201d", "Yeah, let this dude have his little *tantrum. I can see why he feels the need to have a space \"without female judgement\" when just having a lady around causes him to behave this badly. \n\nI am definitely picturing him storming out of the bar like a dramatic Southern Belle. \n\nIt's even funnier because his friends only cared when they lost. \n\nYou're NTA but he definitely is for even asking you not to participate because of your gender and then for his over the top public performance. It's not like this is a group therapy session for men. It's trivia. It's literally just... Trivia night.\n\nEdited... To not get banned, I guess?", "Fair points. Humor/sarcasm is my go-to, sometimes it doesn't translate through text. \n\nI wouldn't *actually* yell that across a playground of children, I know better. But I *might* say it loud enough for the mom to realize how she's raising her child.\n\nI'm glad you were raised better. :)", "This reminds me of when I was in an abusive relationship and the guy I was with for way too long got mad at me when I hit him back. Which I always did. Anyway once I hit him back and he said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be so bad if you hit like a girl, but you hit like a man!\u201d And I was like, \u201cThank you!\u201d  Mind you, he was much bigger than me. Yeah thank God I\u2019m out of that.", "I would prefer to go romcom trivia night and I'm a guy. Sounds like fun!", "I've never heard of a ladies night restricting men from coming. All the ones I've ever seen just make it free for women. For the bar, they know that having lots of women there will draw lots of men, too, and that's good for business!", "In many states in the US it isn't legal.", "The problem here is it wasn\u2019t the bar telling her no it was just a random dude. So the bar isn\u2019t excluding her at all it\u2019s the weirdo who wants his all dude trivia night.", "Seems like op need to tell the manager or something what\u2019s going on so the owner can deal with it", "Not on a weekly basis like this but yes sometimes on a Friday or Saturday night. Have you seriously never been to a rural area?  That\u2019s what it\u2019s like growing up in the middle of no where lol.", "And that is why he\u2019s one of my favorite villains tbh.", "I have read that! I just love that extra little layer to one of my favorite Disney movies.", "Bingo! \n\nShan Yu *[holding Li Shang by neck and pointing sword at him]*: You took away my victory\n\nMulan *[throws shoe at his head, drawing his attention]*: No, I did. *[pulls hair up into bun]*\n\nShan Yu: The soldier from the mountains! \n\nAt no point there or in the fight following does he actually say anything misogynistic towards her which I\u2019ve always found interesting because he easily could have and it being Disney in the 90s they could have gotten away from it.", "Exactly! And he didn't hesitate even a second in trying to kill her, which is probably a weird thing to praise him for, but it means he took her completely seriously.", "I can understand why he worries about women judging him.  I've never met him and I'm judging him like gangbusters.", "Y T A, I can't believe you had the audacity to ruin someone's event by \\*checks notes\\* existing.  Oh.  NTA.", "Mantrum! My new word! Thanks", "I hear you, and yeah i admit i have my cave man moments of incredible stupidity, so you're not *wrong* per se.\n\nBut for the life of me, women are amazing. So many women i know have this ability to rationally think through an emotional storm of Katrina proportions. How can you love and cherish someone if you think you should be able to... i dunno, outrun them because they're... really smart and amazing? Please ladies, outrun me. Out lift me. You're all amazing and pretty, and I love you all like sisters.", "\"Like a girl\" ... I mean... there's so much wrong with that man's reasoning. I'm sorry he hit you. That is not acceptable, manly, or funny.", "I have seen clubs allow all women and only some men. Ladies' nights usually involve a discount for women. Those are both still discriminatory practices and are **sometimes, in some states** legal.", "I use to go to some in the 2000s and early 2010s.  They always started with a show they thought would bring in more women than men. Male strippers, a woman comedian, Spice girls cover band, etc.  It would last about an hour or two, and there would be discounted drinks during that time, similar to a happy hour. Men were welcome at all times, but not many came until after that hour was up. \n\n\nI only went to one club with a \u201cwomen drink for less all night\u201d policy and it was practically all men. We wound up leaving shortly because of how uncomfortable we felt.", "Take it up with the owner, then.  The owner consented to this guy running trivia night.", "I have lived in mostly rural areas until semi-recently. No, it is not normal anywhere for them to block out half their clientele for a friday or saturday night, even once a month. You\u2019re reaching.", "Huh, now I want to rewatch Mulan!", "Use it in good health!", "I am very much using this lol. Thank you", "I like it too, it's also not allowed on this sub because it's a gendered insult. Do you want to get banned?", "Do you think this would fall under the \u201call rights reserved to refuse service\u201d ? Like those signs that say a business can deny you. Just curious", "I\u2019m sure the owner of the bar is super cool with this random dude turning away paying customers because they have vaginas.", "It was one of the first movies I remember seeing in the theatre as a kid so it\u2019s pretty near and dear to my heart haha. \n\nBeing older and wiser now I don\u2019t *love* that they forced a love interest into it (especially now knowing Disney is more than capable of producing films with exciting plots without a speck of it) since the original legend of Hua Mulan generally included her staying incognito as a woman for 12 years until after she was offered and declined the position in government offered by the Emperor and had returned home, when her comrades finally saw her as a woman. \n\nBut considering that it followed the garbage heap that is Pocahontas it\u2019s much closer and shows progress towards cultural sensitivity (although there\u2019s still many issues).", "Yeah... Too bad I had to change it. I thought it was a kinda inspired play on words when I thought of it \ud83d\ude14", "The bar owner isn't selling trivia night, so it's not really applicable.  If the bar owner told her she can't order a beer because she's a woman, then there's a problem.  If the bar owner was selling spots to trivia night and denied her based on her gender, then that's also probably an issue, but that's not what's happening here.  \n\nYa know how some bars have some shitty board games around?  Imagine if a stranger threw a fit because you didn't let them hop in on a game that you and your friends were playing.  Regardless of how bigoted their reasoning is, the owner is consenting to private game playing."]}
