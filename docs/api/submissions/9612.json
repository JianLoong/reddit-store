Sports teams are an irrelevant point and shouldn\u2019t even be brought into this since there are plenty of sports clubs with mixed sex/gender social sports teams for those who want it + men only teams and women only teams (not everyone wants to be in mixed teams as well, esp for contact sports).

The bar is making a rule about women (they are allowed).  The non-employee is making zero decisions.  He's expressing desires.  That's it.  They are effectively a puppet in this scenario.   If he had any power to enforce his desires, do you think he would have left the bar?  And if he actually \\*did\\* have power, why would the OP want to intrude?  It'd be like sitting down at a table of people you don't know and demanding that they include you in the conversation.", "The bar for women to get into congress is way too low, see marjorie taylor green and lauren boebert", "It doesn't matter. They are private establishments, and as such can put on events which cater to any audience they wish. Only in a handful of ass-backwards states is it considered illegal. Most places aren't so archaic.", "For every country you can give me where it's illegal, I can give you two where it's not. So given a bit of context, it's certainly not illegal in *many* countries.", "I don't think the guy in OP's story is concerned with OP's presents, I think it was more of a participation thing that bothered him.\n\nAgain, because it seems nobody reads, he was childish, immature, and lacks communication skills which make him an asshole. Never said he wasn't.", "While I agree with the quote, all I said was guys want a place to hang out with other guys.\n\nWhy is that so evil?", "No, I used the \"ladies night for a safe space\" in response to the person who said all ladies nights are to herd women.\n\nI used ladies night as a general event bars and clubs host as comparison to guys wanting to have a night of there own.\n\nIf you read my first comment though, I actually call the guy in the story childish and immature. And in another post said he lacked communication skills.\n\nBut please, go off on me becasue im a man.", "Unlike George Santos the pillar of integrity.", "Well, that\u2019s true for everyone. Many congressional districts are very uncompetitive and total clowns can win - man or woman.", "The places that are archaic are clearly the ones which deny service based on sex or other characteristics. It is not archaic for that practice to be illegal, because it was historically very common for people to be segregated (by gender, by race, by class etc) and it is only in very modern times that we have recognised dividing the world up like that is not a great thing to do.", "It does matter, though. We carved out exceptions in the law for it. Men wanted to keep their men only clubs", "You think California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are all ass-backwards archaic states? Because they have all found that ladies night promotions are illegal gender discrimination and having a men\u2019s only trivia night would run into the same issue.", "Yes, those \"ass backwards\" states the abide by *federal* law: specifically the [Civil Rights Act of 1964.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964)\n\nPrivate clubs can do whatever the hell they want. However a  **public** business (or accommodations, facilities, schools, and any employers)  can't discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. \n\n[I wonder why that law came to be!?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws)", "*Many* doesn't have to mean *most.* You can use many as a qualifier for something, even if it's not the majority. For example, I could say \"There are many Marvel movies,\" and I don't think most people would disagree. But if you try to do the math, for ever 1 Marvel movie I name, you could named hundreds of non-Marvel movies.", "I understand that. You're just defending men who \"can't be themselves around women.\" Why do you think that is...?", "You said guys want a place to hang out with guys because *they can't be themselves when women are around*.\n\nWhat's wrong is that makes it sound as if the guys can't be themselves because they're sexist jerks and having women around will highlight that fact.", "I mean, first off, I was replying to this whole sidebar that you're having where you're trying to equate safe space for women to judgment-free zone for men.\n\nBut if you want to deflect to an entirely different point, sure. There's nothing inherently evil about guys wanting a place to hang out with other guys, nor do I think anyone said so (certainly not me). \n\nBut it's absolutely an asshole move for the guy in OP's story to unilaterally decide to try and make the bar he likes, which is open to the public, *into* that place by enforcing exclusion on OP or anyone else. It's an asshole move to OP and any other women who might be interested in going, and it's also an asshole move to the owners of the bar who might not like one of their regulars trying to chase off business.\n\nAbsent involvement of the bar's owner(s), it's no different than a little boy and his friends trying to section off part of the playground and saying \"no girls allowed\" and harassing any girls who want to play in that area. It's immature and shitty.", "i\u2019m not \u201cgoing off\u201d on you like\u2026at all. you made a direct comparison, i pointed out that its a bad comparison, and i explained why. i thought we were having a conversation. \n\nbut please, disregard everything i\u2019m saying and act like i\u2019m being unreasonable because i\u2019m a woman.", "Yeah I can believe it\u2019s probably a thing for trash", "So you're weak and have no self-control and you think all men are the same way?", "It really doesn't matter whether a place is members only or not. Aside from a few archaic places (perhaps where you reside) people can choose which demographic they wish to serve without it being automatically discriminatory by law.", "'*You think California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are all ass-backwards archaic states?*'\n\nYes, I do.", "Wrong. Happens all the time here and is perfectly legal. But, you know, Murica is the world...", "\"*Many doesn't have to mean most.\"*\n\nThat's why I said '**...given a bit of context...'**", "Because I'm not defending him? I'm defending the idea that's its not inappropriate or wrong for men to have a night.\n\nBut if we want to dive into the \"men who can't be themselves around women\" comment you made... What's your take on men's mental health? Or is that a myth?", "Yes, becasue when women aren't around, all men immediately become sexist jerks and talk as if women are objects....\n\nHas nothing to do with men's mental health or anything positive.", "Never said he wasn't an asshole. I actually added to it by saying he was childish, immature, and lacked communication skills.\n\nBut this whole branch of comments came from one woman saying ladies nights were essentially to herd women to men.", "You picked off comment that expanded what a ladies night 'could' be, instead of the one box of \"ladies night is for actually for men\" the comment above that put it into. \n\nIt was also from a comment on my comment from the comment on the original post that called both the little man at the bar, and OPs boyfriend sexist. All becasue the little man at the bar lacks social skills, and the boyfriend can see where the little man is coming from.", "First time I thought I was defending her honor. The second time, however, I saw how she instigated the whole thing: My bf will do this and that. Calling them names and shit. I left her ass in that bar and never talked to her again. \n\nAll I'm saying is if OPs bf has been through shit like that in the past he's probably hesitant as I am to get in the middle of an argument like this.", "Why am I trash? Because I won't be dragged into a fight I didn't start?", "I'm weak because and have no self.control because?"]}
