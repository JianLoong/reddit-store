We've never been close and she's always been extremely standoffish and just doesn't acknowledge me or anyone else when she walks in the room. I have been told by my husband, her dad, that I cannot parent or correct her in any way because it makes her uncomfortable, so I have absolutely no relationship with her as a daughter even after 5 years of living together. \n\nShe's always been a troubled kid (horrible grades and barely graduated, no plans for college, caught doing weed, sneaking out, drinking, etc.) but since she turned 18 and graduated in May it's reached a new peak. Here's a brief list of things we've caught her doing just this summer: \n\n- Buying pills (off a strange guy with a face tattoo) in our driveway in broad daylight when we were both home.\n\n- At least 10+ times, sneaking people in through her window or into the house, where my husband has had to get up in the middle of the night to kick them out.\n\n- Found multiple illegal substances, mostly weed, alcohol, and other suspicious things as well (a blowtorch, etc.).\n\n- One time when her dad came down shirtless to kick her out (she lives in the basement) she freaked out and accused him of sexually harassing her and freaking her out. I think this was 100% manipulation.\n\n- Has absolutely no college plans, pays no rent, does exactly zero chores (she doesn't even clean her own bathroom or take out the trash).\n\nIn the past, my husband has dealt with this, but he recently accepted a job on the other side of the country and will be moving out there very soon, while I am staying for a year until my own kids graduate college and to sell the house/finish my job. \n\nThis means it will be just her and I in the house, and I cannot deal with her. However when I basically told my husband this, he got very mad and defensive and said that it wouldn't be fair to her to be kicked out with nowhere to go. \n\nShe does have a job and she says she has $8,000 saved up, and we are in a very low CoL area (can easily get a 1BR for $700/month or less), so she could get an apartment, which I think would be better for everyone involved. Husband does not agree because he is terrified she would never speak to us again and become an addict, but since he refuses to take a firmer stance with her even while she is living with us (getting treatment/therapy, drug testing her, searching her room, taking her car (which he bought), she essentially is free to go down that path even while living here.

End of discussion. No boys. No girls. No guests. She has a room to sleep in, food to eat and she needs to build her life elsewhere. (this might help push her out sooner)\n\nHonestly though? I think your better bet is going to be selling the house ASAP and moving into an apartment with your child when your husband moves and then joining him ASAP. Living with her in the house without him there will be hell on earth. She will make it so and she will play every single manipulative game between her father and you she possibly can.

You didn't say whether your kids live with you, but I'd move into one of those $700 one bedrooms before I spent another night there, especially if my kids lived there too.

Seriously, your husband messed up with the \"parenting will make her uncomfortable\" line, and not doing anything in 5 yrs either to parent her himself, or to help you do it.\n\nI see not wanting to have random men and drugs in your home even if it's just you and her.  With your kids to raise and protect, it's much more serious.\n\nTalk to your husband about finding her a place and helping her with rent, or taking her with him when he leaves.

Once its sold move to some type of temp housing in the interim.", "NTA - I started reading with caution because a step should never be looking to kick out a partner's kid, but this is not a good situation. Not allowed to parent her? That's huge failure number one, which means she will likely go 100% bonkers when he's not there to keep her in check. If you aren't allowed to parent her and she has zero respect for you, then it should be made clear that when he goes, so does she. She goes before he leaves (even if by an hour) and it is 100% clear there is no returning to the house at all... No coming back and \"oh, just need another day\" or \"I forgot something.\" Otherwise you are going to be in for a huge nightmare. If he's not willing to kick her out, he can discuss with her about her going with him, but that's between them. If he's unwilling to take her or move her out, then you need to start looking elsewhere for a place to live. Just based on the little data here, I'd wager you and your kids could be in danger if she remains due to her activities and associations. Normally I'd suggest a contract with immediate eviction if she fails to follow the rules, but this situation does not sound salvageable without her father present", "NTA\n\nI get your husband doesn't want you to parent her but HE needs to parent her.

If she's willing to hurl accusations against her own father, who is providing for her every need despite being an adult now, I shudder to think about what she's truly capable of.  I wouldn't want her anywhere near my minor children who also remain in the home. Shame on your hubby.", "NTA.

The moment he put that restriction in place, you lost any control you might have had over the situation. If your husband is worried about her becoming an addict, how would giving her absolutely no structure prevent that? She's literally going to take over the house once he's gone, because you won't have the right (according to him) to stop her from having people over at all hours of the day and night. How would that be any different than an apartment? Honestly, you should probably consider divorcing your husband and just moving to your own apartment. He's put you in a position that isn't just untenable, it's actually dangerous for you.

It's more likely he'll kick you out before her and I can't even blame him. Likewise I wouldn't blame you for leaving.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s at the crossroads of becoming an addict, her living alone with you won\u2019t help her since you don\u2019t get along she will rebel and getting kicked out will cause her to live with the crowd that she\u2019s doing drugs with. \n\nShe needs help from her father right now or else he is at serious risk of losing his daughter to addiction.

Since he has refused to let op have any say so over HIS daughter, daughter can go with dad or gtfo. Problem solved!", "She refuses to go with him, she doesn't want to leave her friends or move to where he's moving (it's a small town of about 17,000 thousands of miles from us). \n\nThe weed is not overly concerning, but it is illegal here and I work for the state government in a job that requires background checks, so if I was tied to it in any way that would be bad for me.", "They say bless your heart and it is not meant to be nice only to sound inoffensive.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
