Jeez, what is he - 5?? If you order food, especially if it\u2019s frozen, you don\u2019t wait for someone else to put it away.

Impeccable", "It's concerning to me that you view him participating as helping you. You should be equal partners. Equally responsible for meals, ordering & putting away groceries, and every single household task you'd each have to do if you weren't together. Clearly that's not the case, and the person who should be making sure you're okay yelled at you for not completing a task *he* was at least pretending to take ownership of. This is the behavior of a teenage son, not a grown man you should be able to depend on.", "Putting stuff away in the freezer takes a minute tops. He was already in the kitchen.

Why couldn't he put the groceries away? I forsee problems when you have children. Just read the posts on here", "NTA.    Are his arms broken?

I can kind of understand his logic in not doing it himself immediately, but he could have let you know they were there and asked if you wanted to put them away, checked 5 minutes later and put them away himself, or blamed himself when he found them defrosted.\n\nIs this a once off thing that can be explained by him having been sick too, and having foggy thinking, or does he dodge responsibility a lot?", "NTA side eye to you\u2019re husband!", "And imagine any future children", "While he is the AH for not putting the groceries HE ORDERED away himself. \n\nI am pissed he knew you were sick and didn't check on you to make sure you were safe.
