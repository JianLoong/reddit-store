Expecting OP to magically know something arrived and is waiting her in the kitchen without any notification is just mind boggling to me.", "You need to show him \u201cthe mental load\u201d comic because obviously everything always falls to you if this is how he acts. (Like a completely dependent idiot) NTA", "\"I thought you heard the bell\" kind of fills that gap for me. \n\nIt's not great communication, but it's not insane, and it's not asshole. \n\nIt's just a standard marital moment where two people living together aren't altogether sure where their common assumptions begin and end.   It gets frustrating and all, but it's not an asshole thing, just a need-more-communication thing.", "I thought he was going to be mad that everything was still outside but this idiot brought everything to the kitchen and left it there without saying a word. He almost deserves an award for that level of idiocy", "I'm glad you said that. My partner stays at home and does most of the cooking and grocery shopping, but We both kind of intuitively know that whoever brings in the groceries puts it away. You don't just leave shit out. I also don't call it helping when I do shit that's necessary for the household.", "Hang on, he's mad because you didn't pit away groceries he could have easily put away himself so he could teturn to a video game? Ah HELL no. NTA.", "NTA", "Uh, NTA.  If he ordered it, accepted the delivery, and brought it to the kitchen, why didn\u2019t HE put it away?", "NTA umm he got the groceries and assumed you\u2019d crawl out of your sick sleep to put them away and didn\u2019t check? Is he also ate useless? 1000% it was his job to put them away", "Yeah, I thought the same. It infuriates me that he\u2019s trying to make her feel bad because of his own laziness and/ or thoughtlessness. Even if they have an equitable arrangement she was sick. Grrrr!", "Yeah! Why is your husband so involved in his video game while his sick wife takes a bath\u2026and his wife fell asleep, I would assume the wife got out of a cold bath tub. If the bath tub water is cold, she must have been in there for quite some time. Let me finish my question: why is your husband that involved in video games? He should be ashamed of himself and should not be left unsupervised.\n\nDid it not occur to him to check on his sick wife in a bath tub full of water? Is he that self-absorbed? I would have smashed the defrosted soups on his head."]}
