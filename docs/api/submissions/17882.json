He didn't put the frozen food he purchased away after receiving them? Just set down temperature sensitive food on the counter instead of the freezer made no mention to see if you had a handle on it at that. Just went back to playing video games while you were passed out in the tub literally. I'd be furious if I were you tbh.", "NTA.  let me see if I understanding this correctly:  your husband was strong enough to order groceries online AND play video games, but not alert enough receive the grocery delivery NOR put away the groceries NOR check on you, but he CAN wake you up (while you are sick) to complain that \\*you\\* didn't take responsibility for his actions?  \n\nI would put away his video game controllers and \\*forget\\* the location (maybe you put it in the same cabinet where you store the rice).", "nta i get you were both sick but if you can carry those groceries in the kitchen and then go play video games then you can put them away. thats like doing self checkout and expecting someone else to bag your groceries after you scan em, you\u2019re already halfway through just finish it, don\u2019t expect someone else to", "NTA\n\nHe's a grown man, he put the groceries in the kitchen and then didn't put them away - what a child!", "NTA\n\nHe brought the groceries as far as the kitchen then went back to playing a video game.  He could easily have put the food away.  He goofed and is deflecting to make himself feel better.", "NTA.\n\nTalk about weaponized incompetence. Sheesh.", "NTA\nHow can your husband expect you to put away the groceries when your in a bad state. Also I don\u2019t think a grown man should have any trouble putting away groceries. Sure, he also has COVID. But he did have the strength to be playing video games for hours and not the ability to put away the groceries.", "NTA. He heard the doorbell, knew it was food, and went to play his game.", "NTA. So he brought them to the kitchen but didn't put them away? He needs to do better.", "NTA he brought the food to the kitchen and did not tell you it arrived.

He was physically well enough to carry the groceries into the kitchen. I\u2019ll even give him some credit that he knows you usually like to put them away yourself. \n\nBut knowing you were sick, and knowing you were in a bath (usually with a door closed) he just decided to assume you would handle it and went back to his video game?!\n\nHe\u2019s the AH and an idiot.", "NTA.  \"Why didn't you put them away?\"", "INFO I guess: is he saying you are at fault for passing out in the bath while he played video games?

Even if it is usually your job, you're sick.  Being angry or upset at a person who is <sick> and fell asleep in a tub and then went to bed is kindof a jerk move.  To be fair to him, if he isn't feeling well he might have let his frustration boil over as well.", "[deleted]", "NTA", "NTA But please be careful about sleeping in the tub.

Certainly it wouldn\u2019t be a hill to die on.", "NTA but I sense that you are overly controlling about where everything goes and that can lead to \"well, fuck it then, I'm not helping anymore because it's never right according to you when I put the groceries away\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Rearrange it later if you need to.", "NTA Your husband should have been able to think (1) you wouldn't know the doorbell rang, especially as you had told him you would be taking a bath, (2) if he had taken responsibility for ordering what he wanted, it was his job to complete the process by putting the food away, (3) you two need to communicate in general - even more so since you both are sick and probably can't function the way you usually do, and (4) thinking that his video game was more important that putting away frozen groceries that he had ordered.", "That\u2019s how I felt at first. If I asked him to make dinner to help me then him ordering it should still be to help me out, not another chore for me.

It\u2019s not really that I don\u2019t let him, early on I just said if he doesn\u2019t want to follow my system for the pantry he doesn\u2019t need to help me when I get home because it creates more work for me. \n\nBut normally if he goes buys snacks or special items that I don\u2019t normally buy he puts them away himself.

Ill say at that, even if you both expected you to take care of putting the food away, he made no effort to let you know temperature sensitive food is on the counter. Which still puts it on him. He wanted to be lazy and play video games instead of finishing the task at hand at let food and money waste. He should be apologizing imo."]}
