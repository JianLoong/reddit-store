They compete over number of miles run, steps walked, types of yoga class\u2026.  I and BIL try to ignore it.  Sis has got into free swimming and subsequently ice baths and cold showers.  GF has therefore got into it too..  Except she tried free swimming, hated it, tried cold showers hared them, never tried ice baths. I don\u2019t blame her.  Except as far as my sister/ mum are concerned , she\u2019s really into it, more even than sis.  She goes on about it and \u201cnever takes hot showers now\u201d. I\u2019ve got the impression she\u2019s started to annoy them.\n\nWe\u2019re staying at my parents over Christmas.  Today we took turns for the shower, parents, me,  then GF.  Partway through my shower the water went horribly horribly cold and I finished up very quickly.  Told parents.  Mum realised she\u2019d forgotten to put the water heater back on but suggested, completely innocently, that GF would be ok because she didn't like hot showers.\n\nGF looked at me with desperation, for me to say something to sort it.  I didn\u2019t.  I asked her if she\u2019d be ok, giving her the opportunity to say she lied and please turn on the heater.  She didn\u2019t.  With gritted teeth she took possibly the coldest and most unpleasant shower ever (also needed to wash her hair, dragging out the agony)\n\nShe\u2019s now furious with me.\n\nFor info the house is heated and cosy but the bathroom is cold and the water is probably just over freezing.\n\nETA: answering some questions about the heating.  There is a gas boiler for heating and hot water on a timer.  The hot water is timed to come on so they have hot water when they get up.  Gas is really expensive now so they have reduced how long it\u2019s been on for and it\u2019s been ok for the 2 of them. With more people, you\u2019d have to turn it back on, which she forgot to do.  I do believe the forgetting was unintentional. I\u2019m not sure now the comment was innocent.\n\nNot sure what we\u2019ll do yet today, will update later but don\u2019t want to torture her.\n\nUpdate: she\u2019s not a pathological liar, she got carried away.  I think many on here will think it funny if she has cold showers for 4 days but I love her and don\u2019t want to hurt her.  But she\u2019s not made it easy!  After first shower, she showed off a bit to sis (in front of Mum)and sis was impressed (after drinks!).  I asked her WTF she was doing if she wanted to move past this. We argued.  I do now think Mum was NOT being horrible, she was taking it at face value.  GF basically stated she will have freezing showers 4 days! So as of now she\u2019s had 2 and is miserable AF!  I\u2019ll still do what I can, but when she\u2019s not had a drink!

The average hot water heater in a family home has roughly an hour and a half of hot water in it. That's without anyone turning on a faucet for dishes or running the washing machine.

It may be nice after a workout but not in everyday life. \nHe then took a shower BEFORE his wife, ensuring there would be no hot water. Then took joy in either making her expose herself as a liar - for not liking cold showers when it's not after a workout, regardless if she actually likes them or not - or letting her freeze in a cold shower. While his family waited to see if she would. \n\nAll of that is bad enough, but here's the thing: his tone in writing this post was GLEEFUL. He wrote happily about his wife 'getting caught'. He wanted her to. That right there is the basis of an asshole. I stand by what I said in my first comment. No wonder she has to compete, because he tries to make her fail, and revel in it when she does. \n\nI don't care how many people downvote me.

It\u2019s not friendly competition if it\u2019s not a real competition and you\u2019re just lying about it to win. She gets nothing out of \u201cwinning\u201d something that she didn\u2019t even do, so why would she be doing it? That\u2019s clearly malignant, strange, and most of all creepy as hell. \n\nOP\u2019s GF does NOT have to be humiliated\u2014 what is humiliating about saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to take a cold shower today?\u201d Nothing.

So why is it his fault for not doing it, and not hers for DECIDING HERSELF that her lie was more important to her? And wouldn\u2019t they see the boiler was on, know she took a hot shower, and she\u2019d be \u201cabsolutely humiliated\u201d (give me a break) then too?

Though if she doubles down on her narratives, it might be harder.  Good luck to both of you!  NTA", "NTA.  But there is a simple answer.  (Or there would have been, if you\u2019d stumbled onto it earlier.)  You tell your mom that you were actually just trying to be nice and not make her feel guilty about forgetting, but actually, your shower was down to lukewarm when you turned it on and plummeted to ice cold less than a minute later, not half-way through. You may have to embellish this if they can hear the shower running and know how long you were in there \u2014 if so, you can tell them you stepped out of the spray so it wouldn\u2019t be immediately obvious what had happened.  So (you say, apologetically) taking a shorter shower won\u2019t really work because even you didn\u2019t get any.  Mom then has to turn the heater on for a longer time for your benefit, not your wife\u2019s, and even if she turns it on only long enough for one more hot shower in the mornings, if you start taking faster/lukewarm showers, your GF should get just enough to survive.\n\nTHEN you tell your GF she owes you big time for lying on her behalf, and pull out that card the next time you\u2019d like a big favor from her.  And all\u2019s well that ends well.", "I don't like that idea.  This is 100% on the GF.  She wants to be ultra-competitive with his sister, that's her deal.
