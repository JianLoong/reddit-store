When he arrived, my cousin wasn't picking up any of his calls and had slept through his alarms.\n\nLast year, I was completing the final assessment of my degree. As someone with ADHD, I struggle with sudden changes. One day he messaged us and said he was 30 mins away and that he was going to stay for TWO WEEKS. Talk about a lack of notice! My parents, feeling put on the spot, allowed him to stay and had to quickly prepare the guest room and extra groceries. Because of his lack of organisation, everyone else around him was paying the price, including my parents and myself. After this, we discovered that he had booked flights to China with his parent's money without consulting them. Eventually, we found out the reason was that he needed to get emergency tutoring for his IELTS (an international English proficiency test). He had at least 1-2 years to organise this, but left things until the last minute. He also almost missed his flight because he was playing on his phone, until I pointed out the time and that he should probably head to the airport.\n\nRecently, we knew he was returning to Sydney soon for uni. Last night, he suddenly messaged my parents asking them to let him stay at our house. The kicker? He said he was going to arrive NEXT WEEK to stay for 6 MONTHS, giving us no notice to prepare. He said that he had only just realised that renting was going to be much more expensive than last time. I am unsure about his parent's financial situation so I can somewhat empathise, but I was shocked that he didn't plan for this beforehand. It's common knowledge that rent in Sydney has been steadily increasing since 2022, yet he hadn't tried to proactively find work, a source of income or have a backup plan.\n\nI wouldn't mind if he stayed for a few weeks, but 6 months!? Even though he's family, neither my parents or I get along well with him and there's an awkward tension. I think it's unfair that due to his lack of organisation, my family's life has to adjust and revolve around him.\n\nI let my parents know how I felt because of his track record of incidents as well as how much this sudden change would impact me (I'm currently in the middle of my honours, which requires full focus), but understood it was their call. They ended up rejecting his request and now I feel bad that he has to figure things out on his own, but I feel like it was an unfair position for him to put my family in, without having a backup plan.

He sounds exhausting and very immature and selfish.", "NTA I garentee yoy his parents have given him money for accommodation, he is pocketing it to sponge off you. Don't fall for it.", "NTA.\n\nHe should have prepared beforehand. you aren't a rental office that has free rooms for him to just pop in. you don't say a day before, hey, I'm coming to leech off of you for 6 months.\nand u surely don't put that pressure when u know things aren't as smooth as they should. \n1 month, maybe could have been done. but 6 it's a lot. don't they parents have anything to say in this?\nhis lack of preparation is not your burdain to deal with. even if rent has getting higher than last year, he can pay for a few months. and can something  part time.\nbut why bother doing that    when  you can take advantage of family? free rent, free food, free utilities. I think he is TA\nI dont see your family refusal as being asshole.", "NTA.  He should have prepared.    Or maybe even been a good guest when he had been there in the past so you might want to let him stay again.", "NTA! Expecting to stay with someone for 6 months at a weeks notice?!?! Don\u2019t feel bad this is all his own fault.", " NTA. His failure to prepare doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on your part. Offer him a week to get himself squared away, maybe two if you\u2019re feeling generous, but after that, he\u2019s gone. Ideally arrange for a friend or similar to come stay for a few days shortly after whatever deadline you give so that there\u2019s a clear reason why they have to GTFO", "NTA. He's not your family's responsibility, even if he is related to you. It sounds like your cousin has been taking advantage of your parents' hospitality. He was given an inch, and now wants to take a mile. He can find roommates to share the cost of rent with.", "NTA. He sounds like a horrible guest. Your parents and you don\u2019t deserve to be disrespected in your own home. Just be prepared for him to show up anyway. Stand firm on your decision with your parents.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult so he should act like one. It kind of seems like he\u2019s had other people handle things and tell him what to do, where to be, etc. This is shown in the comment about him almost missing his flight until you pointed out that he had to go to the airport. Tough love is called for in this case. \n\nYou already live in the home, permanently for the time being, work FT, while going to school FT. I\u2019ve done that and it sucks, but it\u2019s doable and requires a lot of time management and complete focus when needed. Like when you\u2019re studying. There are 3 people who live in your home and your parents probably would have said yes had you not spoken up. It\u2019s a good thing that you did. Over the years I\u2019ve learned that sometimes you need a reason for saying no without feeling like a prick. Your parents are being great parents by seeing and hearing you and standing firm. He needs to figure this out on his own. Sometimes not having a safety net is the best teacher in life.", "Let me guess, only son, parents spoiled him? NTA. He can live somewhere else and develop some real world experience lol. I'd also hope you get your parents to talk his parents what he's been like and how he's been treating you. I'm guessing you're Chinese and while it's considered necessary to make sure guests have a great time, the other is true and guests have to treat their hosts with the utmost respect and decency. I hope his parents are horrified by what a jerk they've raised. \nAnd HALF A YEAR is stretching it even for the most gracious of Asian hosts especially if the 'guest' doesn't even pay board.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can't expect others to take care of him when he won't take care of himself and you learn more from making mistakes than from doing everything correctly. Hopefully his parents will stop bailing him out or he will never learn to live on his own.", "I wonder if his parents know? I hope your mom discusses it with her sister because this is very immature behaviour. \n\nNTA for choosing not to have him stay.", "NTA. This guy needs to learn that the world does not revolve around him and his needs. Stand your ground on this and don't let him walk all over you and your parents.", "NTA. Cousin needs to learn to plan better, as well as how to be a better houseguest.\n\nThis could (should) be a good learning experience for him.", "NTA.\n\nHe's a mooch and a clumsy one at that. Everything happens suddenly--Hello, I'm 30 minutes away so get the guest room and groceries ready!", "NTA your parents may have said no on their own or actually felt relieved when you backed up a decision they were worried to make for fear of looking bad. My family did take care of my older cousin when he came to the United states to go to college and had no one else. Even though he was known generally as a wild child in his youth, he was so respectful of my parents\u2019 home and of the effort they put into housing/feeding him. In contrast, my other cousin they allowed to stay used to sit outside my parents\u2019 bedroom window at 2 am smoking and talking at top volume on the phone. After ignoring multiple requests to stop as well as other bad behavior, he got kicked out. What you\u2019re describing is someone behaving very entitled and without consideration for others. He seems to have mistaken your family\u2019s home for a hotel.", "Thanks for the validation! I felt so bad that we turned him away but I think he needs to learn a lesson.", "The worst part is that his parents are such kind and hardworking people and save up a lot of their income to send him here to study. I don't think he's pocketing the money because his parents were actually offering to pay us for him to stay here. I think they were also embarrassed at his lack of organisation. His plan was to live in the city which is one of the most expensive places and hadn't looked into any other reasonable options. Once he realised the city was so expensive and everywhere else was already leased out, he had to turn to us. Talk about bad habits and a lack of planning!", "I agree! My dad actually felt super uncomfortable to have him stay here too, but my mum is the type of person who feels the need to give to everyone without thinking twice, especially if they're family. My parents felt a little cornered because my cousin had approached us at the last minute without a backup plan. I told them that as harsh as it sounds, it really isn't our problem. If he wanted to come here to Sydney, he should have planned everything better. His lack of organisation is truly a burden. My parents are absolute angels and I feel like he was trying to take advantage of that.", "Yes, exactly! If he was a good guest in the past, we might have let him stay for a few months or something. In the past, he has been the type to just sleep in, loudly eat with his mouth open at the dinner table (despite us telling him off about it already) and take over the living room as his Zoom meeting space.", "I felt so bad at first because my parents felt sorry for him. I am not sure if it's just an immigrant parent thing, but they have these traditional views that we should always take care of family during dire times. But the thing is, I don't think this is a genuinely dire time. I feel like this terrible situation is just a hole my cousin dug for himself. He could have avoided it with better planning", "This is a terrible idea. If you let him in he\u2019ll never leave. At least, not anytime near the deadline you give him.", "That's what we ended up proposing to him as well. I think it's a reasonable and generous offer. I think this situation will give him a wake up call and hopefully help him learn to organise his own life better.", "Thank you! He really has been taking advantage of my parents' hospitality and I had to list so many examples for my parents to see that. We are now in agreement that he can stay for a few weeks to find his footing but then he has to try and find another place to rent with other people.", "Thanks for the support! We will stand firm. I don't want to positively reinforce his behaviour.", "You're spot on. He has somehow stumbled his way through life with his lack of organisation because he has gotten lucky with people watching out for him or helping him. The only reason I care a little is because we are related by blood. \n\nMy parents and I are working hard and pulling our weight while he has done nothing. My parents were going to say yes to his request to stay if I didn't say anything. But they've admitted to me now that they would have been uncomfortable too. This decision will hopefully be a wake up call for him.", "Haha spot on. He grew up in China under the one child policy. Theres a huge range of issues that made him who he is now. His parents were busy working when he was younger so they didn't spend enough time on him during the important stages of development. I think this made him become a very selfish person who is inconsiderate of other people. I still remember that when I was 6 years old, I visited his family in China and was horrified to see that if he wanted something, he would throw a tantrum and he would get it. So he's always been a bit of a brat. I think his parents have unfortunately grown accustomed to his behaviour so cannot see how terrible it is until it impacts others like in this situation. They have since apologised to us on his behalf. I don't think they knew that he didn't communicate with us beforehand and assumed he had given us enough notice. He is now making other plans to stay elsewhere. Thank god.", "That's exactly what I told my parents. If we keep giving in to his requests and being his go-to plan, he will never learn to do things on his own. His parents have not raised him correctly but that is another issue in itself and something for them to deal with.", "His parents know, but I suspect they've grown used to his behaviour so may not see it for the huge issue that it is. My mum finally discussed it with her sister and they've cleared the air. Luckily, her sister understood the situation and was apologetic for her son's lack of consideration of us.", "Thanks for the support. I hope this teaches him an important lesson about the real world.", "Make sure cousin doesn't guilt your parents when it's time for him to leave. Desperate people do desperate things.", "He is unacceptably rude and thoughtless.", "NTA.  It is time he had consequences for his actions.  Hold firm and do not let him stay even for 1 night because once he is there he wouldn't leave.", "They may be kind and hardworking people but they raised an entitled kid who has no boundaries and is a taker."]}
