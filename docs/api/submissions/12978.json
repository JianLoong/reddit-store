My mother surpassed the 50% and has been forgiven, because she's apologized and is mentally ill, but there's no daughter-mother love from my side. I care for her as I would for a close friend, but I'll never look at her as a child trying to get something from a parent (love, care, help). \n\nYou just have to understand that most people giving you advice will not understand what they're giving you advice about. I spend my time being happy for them that they don't have to mentally go through the same bs I've been going through, but my stance on the matter is firm. \n\nYou'll have to find your own way, but be wary of the people who give advice based on social rules and values, rather than on your personal situation. \n\nIf I were you, I'd move out.

It wasn't easy and she didn't loved us at all (her other son was her golden child, his kids were angels). Her other son couldn't take care of her because he was \"so sensitive\".
