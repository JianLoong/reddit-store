It is not your responsibility to be her caregiver. It is her responsibility to care for you. It sounds like she hasn't been doing a good job at that. You don't owe her.

Most people will be empathetic about what you've been through, but will end up saying: \"you'll regret not doing x y z once you no longer have your parent around.\" That's true for most people who have a parent that's made the usual mistakes. \n\nMy rule is, a parent can mess up 20% of the time and have a perfectly normal child, up to 50% is forgivable, but after that you're threading territory where you can no longer trust, feel safe or care about your parent as a parent. My mother surpassed the 50% and has been forgiven, because she's apologized and is mentally ill, but there's no daughter-mother love from my side. I care for her as I would for a close friend, but I'll never look at her as a child trying to get something from a parent (love, care, help). \n\nYou just have to understand that most people giving you advice will not understand what they're giving you advice about. I spend my time being happy for them that they don't have to mentally go through the same bs I've been going through, but my stance on the matter is firm. \n\nYou'll have to find your own way, but be wary of the people who give advice based on social rules and values, rather than on your personal situation. \n\nIf I were you, I'd move out. One of the red flags in antisocial behavior is a person adopting a new way of thinking/behaving when their current way doesn't serve them anymore. Your mother was abusive because you were weak. Now she's weak and really needs you and she's changing her ways asap.", "NTA.  You don't give birth to nurses.", "NTA. No child has any responsibility over their parents. You don't owe them anything.

The relationship between you and her sounds strained and like you\u2019ve had many basic needs neglected by her, I\u2019m really sorry about that. I don\u2019t get how your parents don\u2019t understand the kind of effect doing something like this could have on you though. Taking care of family is one of the most difficult things to do already. Let alone in such a crucial point of your development. \n\nI really hope there\u2019s another adult you can have help you in this situation because the way you\u2019re being treated already isn\u2019t okay.

Then she needs to make arrangements for her own care that are not dependent on you.  Doesn\u2019t she have any family that can help her?  If not there are likely social services or her doctors office that can help her find the care she needs.\n\nI am sorry that your mom is sick and hope she gets better.  And I am sorry you have what sounds like a rough home life.  And I am really sorry that your dad seems to think you have some responsibility to be your mom\u2019s caregiver.  I don\u2019t care if they are divorced.  His responsibility is to you, his child.

I cared for my mother until her death when I was 27 and it nearly destroyed me for the better part of seven years. You shouldn't even be expected to do anything like that in your age.

She won't ever change. Prioritize school, your studies and your own mental and emotional well being. Your mental health should improve the less you see her. When I went NC with my mum it was like a truck had been lifted off my shoulders. My physical health improved dramatically too. You are a minor, it is not your duty to care for a verbally abusive, sick parent. Your friend has no idea what it is like growing up as a scapegoat.

My parents were working all day and i was the only one of the siblings (5 - i was the 4th) who took care of her. I learned to give her shots, i washed her, fed her, changed her diapers... It wasn't easy and she didn't loved us at all (her other son was her golden child, his kids were angels). Her other son couldn't take care of her because he was \"so sensitive\". So we took her from the other side of the country (where she lived with her son) to us. She wasn't a nice pacient. Only at the end she started apologising for how she treated us but i told her \"never mind that, it's long gone\". I lied.\n\nIt takes a lot of effort to take care of a cancer patient even if you are an adult. It's much more bad when you are a kid yourself. \n\nMy grades went down, i was crying every night and the next day i had to put up a brave face. \n\nHer final remorse didn't help at all. It's of no use to ask for forgivness after a life of bad treatment. It will force the victim to accept the apologise just out of pity. It won't change the past. It won't make you feel better. It will only make that person feeling better.\n\nYou are 14. You are child who isn't responsible for his mother's care.\n\nYour father is wrong. That's not your burden. If he really wants to help, he's the one who must help her, not you.\n\nThere are so many practical things that need to be done when taking care of a cancer patient. Things hard for adults. That's not your job.\n\nI did it and i know what it feels like. You shouldn't have been involved in this. Not even if she would have been the best mother in the world. It's not the job of a minor child to take care of his parents.\n\nMove with your father. NTA", "Yeah, you're right, he should never be **responsible** for anyone's care at 14."]}
