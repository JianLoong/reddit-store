My mother surpassed the 50% and has been forgiven, because she's apologized and is mentally ill, but there's no daughter-mother love from my side. I care for her as I would for a close friend, but I'll never look at her as a child trying to get something from a parent (love, care, help). \n\nYou just have to understand that most people giving you advice will not understand what they're giving you advice about. I spend my time being happy for them that they don't have to mentally go through the same bs I've been going through, but my stance on the matter is firm. \n\nYou'll have to find your own way, but be wary of the people who give advice based on social rules and values, rather than on your personal situation. \n\nIf I were you, I'd move out.

It wasn't easy and she didn't loved us at all (her other son was her golden child, his kids were angels). Her other son couldn't take care of her because he was \"so sensitive\". So we took her from the other side of the country (where she lived with her son) to us. She wasn't a nice pacient.

That's okay. But the responsibility should never be solely on a kid or expected of them, and the adults around them should be taking care to minimise the impact on their life. Which your parents never bothered to do.\n\n Your friend is applying rules from his own experience and family to yours, which is unfair and not applicable. \n\nHonestly this can be a complex issue but this instance itself can't be more clear cut. It's one thing to ask you to help out a few nights a week while your dad gets some free time or your mum has a nap, but quite another to ask you, a child, to become a full time carer, damage your schooling, and be called selfish by the other adults that should have stepped up to help your mum and you through this situation.\n\nAlso, your mum can't even be bothered to respect your pronouns and identity. So why they expect you to respect her enough to care for her when you're a kid that she has constantly abused, is a mystery to me. Just because she's your mum doesn't give her the right to kick you out, take you back and misgender you constantly without consequences.
