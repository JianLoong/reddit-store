My mother surpassed the 50% and has been forgiven, because she's apologized and is mentally ill, but there's no daughter-mother love from my side. I care for her as I would for a close friend, but I'll never look at her as a child trying to get something from a parent (love, care, help). \n\nYou just have to understand that most people giving you advice will not understand what they're giving you advice about.

It wasn't easy and she didn't loved us at all (her other son was her golden child, his kids were angels). Her other son couldn't take care of her because he was \"so sensitive\".

You\u2019re 14.", "My dad got diagnosed with colon cancer when I was 15, it went terminal when it metastasized to his liver when I was 17. He refused to have us care for him, not all cancer is the same and no patient is the same. He went on hospice care late last year, I\u2019m a CNA, he still refused until the day he died. I am certified to care for people in a medical capacity, there is so much that goes into being a caretaker, you\u2019re too young to do that. There are probably going to be meds, lines, drains and other medical devices you don\u2019t need to be responsible for. OP, I\u2019m sorry your mom has cancer, it fucking sucks, but you\u2019re NTA. Take care of yourself, you\u2019re 14, if you need to DM someone, I\u2019d be more than happy to talk.", "NTA - her not using your proper pronouns is reason enough imo but throw in thinking a 14 year old is equipt to care for a parent with cancer and name calling on top of all that; no way do you need to be there.  I hope you are able to get out of there quickly.", "NTA \n\nYou're 14. Your priorities are 100% correct. School and your mental health come first. Move in with your dad and see about maybe a part-time job or figuring out a safety net for emancipation if it comes to it. \n\nYou don't owe your mother anything. If your dad wants someone to care for your mom, he can't either pay or he can move in and do the work himself. You are a child. That is not your responsibility and even if you were an adult, children owe their parents nothing. They decided to give birth to you. The obligation is entirely on them.", "NTA. You\u2019re so young to be a carer even if she were nice to you. Please go live with your dad and don\u2019t stay with her if she\u2019s abusive", "Tbh, I don\u2019t think dad really wants OP either, claiming they\u2019re selfish because a **14yo child** doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for his *56yo mother*", "^ this. You are under no obligation to care for her especially when you\u2019re 14. She\u2019s made home life hostile by refusing to use your pronouns and verbally abusing you. Even if she hadn\u2019t done that, it\u2019s still your choice. NTA.", "This is one of those posts where I really want to hear the mum\u2019s side. Who knows what all she\u2019s dealing with, along with a teenager. \nHas she explicitly said she wants OP to care for her, or OP assumed it\u2019ll be too stressful and wants out. \n\nDepending onthe relationship, OP may regret this if she passes away. He doesn\u2019t get it now cz he\u2019s young.", "[removed]", "Honestly though, if I were OP I probably wouldn't even want to see her on weekends. And OP as old enough for a judge to consider it. \n\nKicking a 13 year old out of the house? Refusing to use his pronoun? Being a significant cause of his depression? That'd a no for me.", "I agree with everything you said. People always give fake advice all the time. I just wonder if they really believe it", "This is so well articulated...", "Everyone in his life sucks too. His dad\u2019s response should have been \u201cAbsolutely not. You are a kid who needs to be focused on school and your own development. You should not be a caretaker at this young age.\u201d None of this selfish crap.", "The nurses get brought in by storks", "CNA here, no 14 year old should be a caretaker, if you can\u2019t get certified, you are too young. The fact that the mom asked appalls me.", "Agree. Although my upvote and your logic are lost in Reddit\u2019s sea of self obsessed teenagers.", "This is a bot stealing a partial comment.", "Wth are you talking about? He's **FOURTEEN** and was treated like sh\\*t for years on top of that. He's not objectively qualified to be the carer. It's the parents who are entitled, expecting a **minor** to do an adult's job.", "Was probably just the dad, parents been split since op was 4.\n\nCan\u2019t imagine why, mom sounds so lovely. \ud83e\udd14", "I'm a child welfare worker and I got to sit in on a court case to watch, and the dad fully told the judge to his face he wanted his son to come home because he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was losing his vision and needed his son to take care of him because \"That's what children are supposed to do\". The judge was literally speechless", "a 14 year old can help. ALOT. but that is not the same as 'responsible'.", "Maybe the mom will regret bullying and misgendering their kid for four years straight.", "Exactly, he\u2019s YOUNG. Barely a teenager. He should not be dealing with this pressure, nor should he be responsible for another\u2019s care.", "Regardless, he\u2019s 14, he\u2019s a minor and shouldn\u2019t be primary caregiver.", "This is a bot stealing a partial comment from further down the thread.", "If I could vote this response to the top, I would.", "I'm so sorry for your experience but your post is really powerful & informative.", "Go live with your dad. You may not even have to see her on weekends. Highlight the emotional abuse to a judge. Her constant name calling, guilt tripping etc. It could get dad full custody. You're old enough to be listened to in court in many places.", "Y\u2019all both missed the part where the mom refused to use op\u2019s pronouns and also kicked them out the house.", "[removed]", "Please tell us the judge told the father that the minor child was not a built in health care aide. Please", "As someone who enjoyed taking care of my grandma and going along to chemo treatments when she had multiple myeloma I completely agree. But that was because I wanted to. I can\u2019t imagine if I had been forced into it (my grandma would\u2019ve never done that but still) by those around me", "Thank you!!! Indenturing yourself to an abusive & cancer-stricken parent at 14 seems pretty clearly to be a bad idea....", "It\u2019s hard to care for a parent even when you can drive. It\u2019s exhausting even when you\u2019re a legal adult. This kid does NOT need to be caring for his mom. That\u2019s not his responsibility.", "Nuclear families are not synonymous with child labor.", "I don't understand your comment.", "The judge got so mad at the guy he stopped the whole court session and went off record to yell at him.  The judges in our circuit don't put up with that, I've seen a judge scream at a parent to shut up and sit down before", "Yeah, it was a rough 4 months when my grandmother moved in briefly. There were 3 adults to help out, and it finally became too much. She ended up having a stroke and ended up in a nursing home. It felt bad doing that to her, but I know they were better equipped to deal with her needs. I couldn't imagine a 14 year old doing it by themselves. OP is NTA.", "Good on the judge. Visiting Nurses & home health aides are more qualified then a minor child.\n\n\nAs for the OP of this thread, if Mum asks for a cuppa, yeah, IMO, the kid can do that. If Mum is expecting the OP to do PICC line maintenance, hell no.", "Almost anyone is more qualified than a minor child. My cat is more qualified than a minor child."]}
