Ashley and I are really good friends and work very closely; also, since it was our area of expertise, it made the most sense for our company to send us.\r\n\nAshley\u2019s husband (Justin, M39) also works for the company. Long story short, Justin doesn\u2019t like me at all. Personally, I think he\u2019s a bit prejudiced (and insecure), as he didn\u2019t mind me at all while our company was working virtually (during COVID), but once he met me in person, his opinion changed. Since then, there has been a pretty noticeable sense of rivalry between us. Furthermore, Ashley has mentioned previously that he doesn\u2019t like how closely we work together and how friendly I am with her.\r\n\nThe business trip was both successful and fun. We finished most of our work obligations on the first 2 days of the trip, so we spent most of the third day having some fun and enjoying the city. Justin texted Ashley pretty often, asking what we were up to, which was a bit obnoxious. At some point, I asked her to respond less often, and that did get him to stop asking so many questions.\r\n\nSince we got back, Ashley has been telling me that Justin is acting strangely. Yesterday evening, he told her how uncomfortable the trip made him feel. She went on to tell me that it wasn\u2019t just the trip, but also how close he thinks we are and how often we text and joke around with each other. I felt annoyed that Justin seemingly wanted to exert some control over my life, so I told Ashley that his concerns and insecurities were not my problem.\r\n\nShe said that I was being too unsympathetic towards him and that I needed to be more patient with him.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1692195979, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sre3i/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_that_her_husbands/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could be a little more respectful. You shouldn\u2019t be telling Ashley how to handle her marriage (unless it was a serious matter) and tell her to stop texting her own husband. I think majority of people would be a little insecure if their partner was extremely close with a co-worker of the opposite sex and went on a business trip with them. However, him and his wife also need to communicate their boundaries. He should be more clear and Ashley should understand her husbands apprehensiveness better. This could all be fixed if they simply had a discussion. In the end, i wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an a-hole, but maybe be more mindful.

I would tell her that while I personally know that nothing happened and we were just friends, I couldn't risk my job or my integrity on this kind of drama, and that we couldn't be friends anymore, just coworkers. It sucks Justin is making this a whole thing, but trust when I say you want no part of what happens if he makes this an issue the company is aware of... we have to suspend everyone, do an investigation, and at the end of it, we're still most likely to let them go... it's honestly not hard to find reasons to let people go if you look for them.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your plan was to show his wife this thread if you got the kind of replies you were expecting.", "YTA - his insecurities are not your concern. But why are you telling this woman when she can and can't text her husband? Sounds like you're the one trying to exert control and he has good reason to dislike you. Have you thought about adjusting your behaviour to be more considerate of your friend or are you only concerned with what you want?", "ESH. \n\nHusband is definable insecure and shouldn't be taking it out on you. However telling her not to communicate with her spouse while she's on a business trip is an AH move. Her husband takes priority over you, and it's not even close", "ESH. You're right, as other commenters have noted, that his insecurities are not your problem. But you also don't have a right to get annoyed at how, or how often, she communicates with her husband. It has nothing to do with you, and if you really cared about her as a platonic friend, you would be helping her to reassure her husband that nothing is going on. Also, as other commenters have stated, your attitude makes you sound like you get off on the fact that her husband is jealous of you, which probably means that you insert yourself and your opinions into their relationship when you should just stay the fuck out of it. The fact that you called your relationship with him a \"rivalry\" says a lot. If it was just him being jealous, it's not a rivalry, it's just pure jealousy. A rivalry implies you are competing against each other for the same thing.\n\nAnd while she's entitled to be friends with whomever she chooses, she also has a responsibility to respect her husbands boundries and to make him feel safe in the relationship. That doesn't mean she has to bend to all of his insecurities, but she should at least be understand and sensitive to them. She appears to be doing neither, but there's a lack of information on that part to make any real judgement.\n\nFinally, the husband needs to work on his insecurities and trust issues. That said, I'd be curious if this is a common problem in the relationship or if it has only started with you. If it has only started with you, I'd be hard pressed to believe that you (and possibly her) didn't give him a reason to feel insecure.", "Lmao YTA bro. You don't get to dictate how a co-worker/friend interacts with her spouse. Full stop.

You're throwing gas on the problem.  You also seem a little insecure.", "It sounds like you're in love with Ashley. This reminded me of a situation I saw play out irl and the girl in your position had no idea, remained in denial, got weirdly protective and didn't understand why her amazing friend was \"always dating arseholes\".

I can\u2019t imagine my husband finishing his work a day early and not switching his flight to come home. This relationship with your coworker is sus.", "ESH. While your right that he has no right to control any aspect of your life he is allowed to communicate with his wife. Was it excessive and jealous and pathetic to message her every 5 mins yeah but she clearly didn\u2019t mind that so that\u2019s on her.

You can be clear however that none of that effects you and what you want to do.", "YTAH.\nHer communications with he husband are not your business. \n\nImportant note:  if someone doesn't like you it may not be down to prejudice.

You were running around having a fun day.", "ESH.  You are all too familiar with eachother in this work environment.   Are you all friends or co-workers?  Because its going to come to that choice soon if you keep going down this road.", "The fact that she's telling you how her husband feels in this capacity, and how knowing how he feels you asked her to text him less.\n\nYou're both TA.

You're not doing that, and she's encouraging it.", "He was cool with you while you were working virtually because you weren\u2019t in close physical proximity to his wife. Now you are and he doesn\u2019t like it. There\u2019s zero call for an allegation of racism there. \n\nSounds like she is trying to manage two men trying to control her. Why would you tell anyone to stop responding to their spouse?  That is an AH move. And you\u2019re either into her or into the idea that this guy is jealous of you. One or the other. Either way, you\u2019re being a jerk here. YTA.", "YTA. You have become Ashley's work husband. Could be harmless, but could easily slip into a cheat thing.

Maybe he feels like he\u2019s never been enough, and now he sees his wife going on a business trip with a male coworker that she\u2019s close with. Wtf else is he supposed to think? And you tell her to respond LESS when his imagination is probably already going crazy? \n\nBro, you suck.", "YTA / don\u2019t give her directives on how to communicate with her spouse.  Here is one thing I\u2019ve learned about situations like this ,, not that it\u2019s happening here but it happens - the person with the jealous spouse likes to leverage the friendship against the spouse, while you \u2018the friend\u2019, have no clue.  This happened to me.  Not fun.  I had no idea.  When I met the spouse she was hella rude and I was like wtf,, well later when my co worker / friend was mad at his wife he told me what he did.  So, we are not co workers or friends anymore and he\u2019s off all my socials and out of my life.  That is some BS.  It sucks because I thought he was pretty cool, as a FRIEND.  I will add this - I am old enough to be his mom so it was next level wtf to me.", "Just admit it dude, you're into your coworker", "YTA \n\nThis sounds like an emotional affair. If the roles were reversed everyone would be pointing out how inappropriate yours and Ashley\u2019s behaviors are.

You're no good I can feel it.", "Meh, NTA. You\u2019re all adults and his issues with you simply aren\u2019t your problem. As an aside, I find it humorous that people are saying YTA due to you telling her that she shouldn\u2019t respond as often to hubby\u2019s texts. She\u2019s a grown ass woman.

So at my count, that's both OP and Ashley showing character deficiencies.  \n\nAnd for OP's ego, I'd caution that it does NOT necessarily mean Ashley is attracted to him, it could be she just enjoys a little turmoil.  Either way, this is a dangerous situation to him with respect to work, and he is not being particularly smart about it.", "It was pretty annoying at the time. We were at a museum at the time, and for a bit, it felt like she was getting a text from him every 5 minutes", "She's been confiding in me for some time now. Mainly because she says that she feels so comfortable around me", "That and the fact he mentions having a rivalry with Justin. If the two of them don\u2019t work in the same department, then why would OP have a rivalry with him?

Someone here is insecure and controlling, and it\u2019s the person who wants to bone their married coworker.", "OP literally makes a point of saying, \u201cI was annoyed that Justin seemingly wanted to exert some control over my life,\u201d because *Justin was texting his own wife.* Sorry, OP, but a therapist would have a field day with that little slip!

I don\u2019t rly think it\u2019s a crime to text your spouse at work anyways but to each their own. I usually text a reminder or ask smth at least 2-3 times at work. With a whole business trip, I\u2019d imagine I\u2019d text more often as well. I\u2019d also want to make sure my partner is safe if they\u2019re traveling or doing a job far away.", "\"Yeah, you're on the phone so I'm ending the museum trip,\" sound like petulant child AH behavior, more than saying, \"You don't have to text them back while we're busy.\"", "What a friend you are", "If I ask you to go out with me after work, and then ignore you to sit on my phone, how is that not being an AH?", "That\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m getting too lol, it *would* be really annoying if your date was texting their husband/had a husband", "You keep saying this, but I think you're reading too much into this apparent \"slip.\" Everyone, including half the comments are making mountains out of mole hills here.\n\nPeople should be able to go out with friends/go on work trips without having to respond to incessant messages from partners left behind. They are adults, not children.", "That\u2019s actually very mature if presented the right way. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the time and space you need to sort this out with Justin. I\u2019ll be at the bookstore/coffee shop/local tourist attraction; text me when you\u2019re done!\u201d Smile, wave, make your exit.", "So you're suggesting that you would demand your friend stop paying attention to their own life and just entertain you? What a \"friend\" you are", "So you instead would insist your friend pay attention to you instead of acknowledge their spouse? Some friend YOU are", "It's more mature to say, \"is it possible to ask your husband to text slightly less while we're in the museum?\". Idk how he asked it but it's more mature than saying let's stop what we're doing (especially if she wanted to hang out with him).", "No, I\u2019m just saying that it wouldn\u2019t have been cool for OP to straight up abandon her because of her husband. While I do agree that OP definitely could\u2019ve handled the situation better, I can also see why he was upset that."]}
