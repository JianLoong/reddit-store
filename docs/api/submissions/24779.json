You could be a little more respectful. You shouldn\u2019t be telling Ashley how to handle her marriage (unless it was a serious matter) and tell her to stop texting her own husband. I think majority of people would be a little insecure if their partner was extremely close with a co-worker of the opposite sex and went on a business trip with them. However, him and his wife also need to communicate their boundaries. He should be more clear and Ashley should understand her husbands apprehensiveness better. This could all be fixed if they simply had a discussion. In the end, i wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an a-hole, but maybe be more mindful.

A rivalry implies you are competing against each other for the same thing.\n\nAnd while she's entitled to be friends with whomever she chooses, she also has a responsibility to respect her husbands boundries and to make him feel safe in the relationship. That doesn't mean she has to bend to all of his insecurities, but she should at least be understand and sensitive to them. She appears to be doing neither, but there's a lack of information on that part to make any real judgement.\n\nFinally, the husband needs to work on his insecurities and trust issues. That said, I'd be curious if this is a common problem in the relationship or if it has only started with you. If it has only started with you, I'd be hard pressed to believe that you (and possibly her) didn't give him a reason to feel insecure.", "Lmao YTA bro.

This happened to me.  Not fun.  I had no idea.  When I met the spouse she was hella rude and I was like wtf,, well later when my co worker / friend was mad at his wife he told me what he did.  So, we are not co workers or friends anymore and he\u2019s off all my socials and out of my life.  That is some BS.  It sucks because I thought he was pretty cool, as a FRIEND.

Always refer to her in conjunction with how you appreciate EVERYONE. If she says she isn\u2019t satisfied or wishes things could be like they were, tried to blame you or ask if she did something wrong, or acts hurt, emphasize that you are happy with the work relationship but that if she is unhappy, she might suggest shifting teams so that she works more closely with her husband because he seems to be wanting the same kind of things she has discussed. \n\n\n\nGood luck!", "YTA.

So you have like half a day to get to know the city or just relax and go to the movies. I don't see the problem.\n\nI've done the same thing, we finished on a Saturday morning and the whole group that traveled booked our flights for Sunday night so we could enjoy the city for a day and a half.", "Hell, my husband used to take 2-3 extra days afterward to enjoy the city and decompress. I never got upset with him, I was excited for him. If he thought the area was fun, then we ended up going later together. There have been a few time I've flown in to be with him, like when his work gave them free Disneyland tickets for a long weekend.\n\n But I also know we aren't codependent. We can survive time apart. It's healthy for a couple to have their own time and to be independent.", "You are trash.", "YTA. Get your own girl.", "YTA, from the post alone and your responses should make you ashamed.\nYou're getting in between a married couple and even being possessive over her. She should listen to her husband's concerns because they're married, and she doesn't owe you SHIT, dude.\nI hope this somehow blows up in the workplace and it gets you fired because you seem predatory as fuck.", "YTA. You sound so condescending here. You\u2019re downplaying your interactions and conversations with her, that much is evident. Also you really gave your intentions away telling her to stop responding to her husband while she\u2019s out on a work with a coworker she\u2019s emotionally cheating with. You\u2019re creating workplace drama, and it\u2019s purposeful at this point. I hate people who cheat on their partner or spouse. They\u2019re disgusting. Affair partners that know about their conquest\u2019s spouse are just as gross. I hope you get fired for creating a hostile work environment", "Didn\u2019t believe this crap for a second and reading the comments just confirmed my suspicions about you. You having a rivalry in a work setting with a coworker as an adult, and you clearly don\u2019t respect the guy and are trying to break up the marriage. You can even say that you\u2019re not jealous of him until you\u2019re blue in the face as you clearly are. Get over it. She\u2019s married and you need to back off. Creep. \n\nYTA, mate. Big time.", "Jesus you're an AH. Please don't ever tell a spouse to text there spouse less. Why are his insecurities not your concern but her texting is? Sorry but it's obvious from the way you wrote this that you have some feelings for her. Either that or you're just a dick that likes to mess with people. Back off her dude.\n\nYTA.", "Why is this woman also telling this guy about what they talk about with her husband. Like good grief amd why would anyone listen to someone telling them to text less with their significant other.", "Are you married as well? Would you be comfortable if your wife said those things about you? YTA for getting in the middle of things by telling her to respond less.", "YTA. \n\nMaybe put yourself in his shoes.", "If a woman my husband works with told him to text me less, I would be on a plane.", "> why are you involving yourself when you supposedly don\u2019t want to be involved?\n\nLEAVE ME OUT OF THIS SITUATION that i am clawing my way into", "I agree, but thinking about how it would be different if they were both male, I kinda see his point too.\n\nLike, I\u2019ve gone on vacation with a friend that had a controlling girlfriend, at some point most of us told him to stop being always available to her during the vacation.\n\nLike we\u2019d be having drinks and she\u2019d call him to send video to show he isn\u2019t with any girls.\n\nWe basically told him to talk to her less, we\u2019re on a trip and she\u2019s controlling him (and us by proxy).\n\nIt does seem in this case that OP wants to impose on the relationship, but we aren\u2019t really sure.", "I'm sure there's a German word for it", "OP totally told on himself. Friends don't tell their married coworker friend to stop texting their husband... OP . YTA", "Yeah him describing it as rivalry, somehow knowing exactly what goes on in the marriage, telling her to stop texting instead of doing things on his own if it bothered him and his wording, all make me suspect he is interested in his coworker. \n\nI can't exactly explain why but the whole post makes me feel like the husband is not insecure but has good instincts.", "Yeah going on a work trip with a coworker is one thing spending the entire last day together hanging out on a date viewing the city having dinner while purposely ignoring your husband for a different guy is wildly inappropriate", "Red flag city.", "This is just embarrassing for OP. You\u2019re into someone else\u2019s wife so much that you have to take offense to them catching onto it? Definitely TA and needs a reality check.", "nothing, you idiots! Taatertot's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)", "I would bet a lot that Ashley is very attractive and OP doesn't want to do anything but feels a 'rivalry' over her attention anyway. Bleugh.", "From what he\u2019s said here, I disagree that Ashley is doing anything wrong. She definitely might be, but not from what we\u2019ve heard. We have no reason to believe Ashley is doing anything to make the husband rightfully jealous. \n\nHaving opposite sex friendships is normal, having opposite sex coworkers is insanely normal. She\u2019s doing what she can (texting her husband back timely) to help decrease his anxiety. There\u2019s only so much she can do - this is her career. She\u2019s on a business trip, not out clubbing until 3am with the dude. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to blame her for this at all.", "You're certainly right that this Ashley's problem, not OP's. \n\nBUT, OP claims that Ashley is a \"really good friend\".  If one of my \"really good friends\" had a problem, I'd want to support them in dealing with it.  I would certainly display a  decent amount of empathy.  Perhaps more importantly, I certainly wouldn't do anything to exacerbate the problem.\n\nThat's why he's an AH.", "Yep. My mom and her coworkers used to coordinate stuff they wanted to do in advance of the trip, even. So if they ended up with enough free time they didn\u2019t waste time making plans, they already knew the plan was to go to X location or Y restaurant or what have you. There were a couple people she traveled with fairly often and they ended up in quite a routine of finding interesting outlet stores and restaurants near wherever they were - they\u2019d do a bit of poking around to see what the deals were then go to dinner somewhere they wouldn\u2019t be able to go to otherwise. (So no national chains.)", "Because he doesn't care and from other comments OP has made, I think he thinks, he will be there to \"console\" her when shit hits the fan in her marriage.", "I completely agree and I\u2019m flabbergasted by the number of people who are saying the husband needs to work on himself! The texting might be a lot but we don\u2019t have context, but he\u2019s discussing his feelings with his wife like a grown adult and everyone here interprets that as insecurity - say what?!!! She\u2019s the AH knowing her husband has concerns that he\u2019s raising with her to then blab it all to the guy husband has concerns about. And OP is an AH because as you said he doesn\u2019t respect the husband or the marriage.", "OMG!", "For sure! I think that even if we assume there is no romantic relationship going on, there is definetely something toxic going on if OP is making the relationship he has with her husband a priority here. Call it a pissing contest or pure egocentric behaviour, his friendship is not what a genuine friendship should be.", "Or she has cheated on him previously. Either way OP isn't trying to help her as he is just mad because \"I felt annoyed that Justin seemingly wanted to exert some control over my life\" unlike when he exerted control of this mans wife and told her to stop texting. I am going ESH", "Tbh if I was this woman I would be pissed off if a coworker told me my husband needed to text me less after a conference. Wtf business is it of his?", "You would think so, but he's certainly giving up all the info in his comments anyway", "Tbh I think this kind of thing is often a self fulfilling prophecy. Jealous partner is overbearing and annoying cause they're jealous, drives their SO away, their SO eventually leaves them.\n\nI used to climb a ton with this girl who was in a LDR, like 3-5 times a week cause we lifted and climbed together, which I admit was a lot, but it was nice to have a consistent workout partner.\n\nShe had to hide it even when we went to grab chipotle after or something because her BF would constantly try to facetime her at times when he knew she was at the gym. And he'd apparently flip out if she didn't answer, if she did he freaked out at what she wore to meet me, even what I wore (like at one point she asked me to change what I wear to the gym cause her bf saw on facetime and it made him uncomfortable), or if we were hanging out at anywhere but the gym, etc.\n\nFew months of this, I meet her BF as he comes to visit and it's weird as hell cause this guy so clearly hates me. Couple days after he leaves I get an emotional midnight call where she tells me they broke up and yeah I was not surprised at all", "I would say it's not the exploring but the frequent texting and general closeness.", "If your company sends you out you\u2019re not getting a ticket switched. Why not enjoy the time though? I\u2019d be upset to know my spouse isn\u2019t exploring or enjoying time with friends bc of me. My husband has gone on work trips with other women and he has fun exploring and seeing new things especially during overseas deployments.", "It sounded like wife was telling OP all the husband drama and he told her to just stop texting her husband so there's less drama for him to hear? \n\nA bit like if someone said that their mum kept messaging them and that it was annoying or stressful, I'd just tell them to put the phone away and enjoy themselves while we're out. \n\nI think the wife is the AH for sharing her husband's insecurities with OP. That's between the couple to work out and not OP place to care or do anything about the husband's insecurities. It's on the wife to change her behaviour if she wanted to, and to put boundaries in place with OP."]}
