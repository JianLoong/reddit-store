You could be a little more respectful. You shouldn\u2019t be telling Ashley how to handle her marriage (unless it was a serious matter) and tell her to stop texting her own husband. I think majority of people would be a little insecure if their partner was extremely close with a co-worker of the opposite sex and went on a business trip with them. However, him and his wife also need to communicate their boundaries. He should be more clear and Ashley should understand her husbands apprehensiveness better. This could all be fixed if they simply had a discussion. In the end, i wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an a-hole, but maybe be more mindful.

Also, as other commenters have stated, your attitude makes you sound like you get off on the fact that her husband is jealous of you, which probably means that you insert yourself and your opinions into their relationship when you should just stay the fuck out of it. The fact that you called your relationship with him a \"rivalry\" says a lot. If it was just him being jealous, it's not a rivalry, it's just pure jealousy. A rivalry implies you are competing against each other for the same thing.\n\nAnd while she's entitled to be friends with whomever she chooses, she also has a responsibility to respect her husbands boundries and to make him feel safe in the relationship. That doesn't mean she has to bend to all of his insecurities, but she should at least be understand and sensitive to them. She appears to be doing neither, but there's a lack of information on that part to make any real judgement.\n\nFinally, the husband needs to work on his insecurities and trust issues. That said, I'd be curious if this is a common problem in the relationship or if it has only started with you. If it has only started with you, I'd be hard pressed to believe that you (and possibly her) didn't give him a reason to feel insecure.", "Lmao YTA bro.

This happened to me.  Not fun.  I had no idea.  When I met the spouse she was hella rude and I was like wtf,, well later when my co worker / friend was mad at his wife he told me what he did.  So, we are not co workers or friends anymore and he\u2019s off all my socials and out of my life.  That is some BS.  It sucks because I thought he was pretty cool, as a FRIEND.
