{"id": 16758, "submission_id": "13c7wlo", "title": "AITA for not letting my mom or MIL at my house because of their animals?", "selftext": "My son has asthma and we are still learning his breathing triggers. But even without his asthma being a factor, I don't want animals at my house. We don't have pets outside of my son's 3 goldfish. I won't say I dislike animals, because I actually do like animals. But I hate shitty pet owners and can't tolerate being around them if I'm being honest. \n\nSo my MIL has a MASSIVE 1 year old Mastiff/Rottie mix. Beautiful dog. She hasn't attempted to train him. I don't even like going to my MILs house because the second you walk on to the property this dog is jumping up on you and knocking you on your ass. His paws alone are damn near close to the size of my head. She has shown up here twice with her dog, without even telling us and I absolutely cannot deal with it. The dog never stops barking or playing and the chaos fucks with my head to a point of me being pissed and feeling trapped. \n\nThen there's my mom.. my mom is a farm girl. She has a whole slew of farm critters. Dogs, cats, goats, chickens, turkeys, cows, pigs and geese. Her business is basically breeding and growing meat goats. So, every year she has about 16+ baby goats that she has to bottle feed every 2-6 hours (depending on their size and age). Generally speaking, she ALWAYS has a goat with her. They are small and super cute but I don't want a flipping goat at my house when she comes to visit. She doesn't try to bring the goats inside or anything like that but she does let them roam around my yard and shit everywhere and chew on things and I'm so over it. \n\nSo basically, when my son was diagnosed with asthma, I told both my MIL and my mom they couldn't bring the animals here anymore due to my kids asthma. I've told them they couldn't before the diagnosis but ultimately they didn't listen at all. But now that my son has this diagnosis, if they are to show up here with the animals they will be cut completely from our lives. My mother was fine with it but my MIL is pissed, saying her dog isn't the reason he has asthma and I'm just a dog hater and terrible person.

His first attack happened at school but his other attack happened while we were at a petting zoo so they are running allergen tests next week.", "It would be entirely valid to just not want people's pets in your home. Why do people insist on taking their dogs everywhere? I love cats, but I would be very taken aback if a guest to my home brought their cat over. I don't know how their cat is with furniture,  getting up on countertops/tables, and I have birds (that my own 12 y/o cat absolutely never bothers; one of the birds even naps on him). Even without a reason,  it isn' out of pocket to just refuse entry to someone's pet.", "I don't particularly like dogs, so (only with a couple exceptions) I'd never allow one in my home. Also my husband and two of kids are mildly allergic to dogs. That said, my cousin has a gorgeous Tibetan mastiff, that is now very well-trained; I genuinely like that dog. However,  when he was still a large puppy,  he scared the shit out of me. Large dogs generally scare me a bit, and I was pregnant when he was an \"adolescent\" - he was a sweet dog but could easily knock 5' me on my ass.

(I will totally will give tiny puppies a chance though; I mean they are babies) On the street, I would avoid a mastiff like the plague (large dogs always kind of scare me), but I was a guest in my cousin's home and I'd met Chas when he was still a little fluff ball. He's a good dog. I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't make me a bit nervous to be alone with him, or that I have ever left my toddler unsupervised with him, but he is a very sweet dog. It probably helps that he is a working dog and his \"job\" tires him out. Honestly,  I'm just a sucker for cute animals; he carries around stuffies even when he is guarding their goats, and he is so sweet with the baby goats.", "It is also important to remember that some dogs like Chas are still babies when they are very big.\n\nAnd leaving young kids alone with dogs is usually a bad idea. Not 100% of the time but usually best not to risk it. It is also good to teach your kids safe dog manners so they are safe and not afraid of dogs growing up. \n\nAsk before you pet strange dogs and interact enough so they can read dog body language so they know when not to be afraid and when to steer clear.", "Oh, yes. My mom was afraid of dogs (despite having grown up with well-behaved dogs and almost everyone in the family having them), but she tried not to pass on that fear. She taught me to always ask an owner before you approach/pet their dog and she taught me \"gentle hands\" with cats and dogs since I was small. I've done the same with my kids. The oldest isn't afraid of dogs, but only really likes puppies and small dogs, the younger ones like dogs (although my toddler is still perfecting \"gentle hands\"; even my chill old-man cat gets annoyed with his shit sometimes). I don't know if this is right or wrong but my husband (who actually very much likes all animals) and I taught the kids to just stay away entirely from any stray dog (unless it is a literal tiny puppy, with no mommy dog around).\n\nChas was very much an oversized baby, just very over-excited to see people.", "Probably right for younger kids to stay away from all strays. \n\nWhen they get older they can make there own choices which I think is just the goal for everything.\n\nSomeday hopefully they will be better than you are at everything and if they choose to have kids those kids will hopefully be better than them. \n\nThat is how you know you were a good parent", "Hopefully! The oldest is almost 18, so that is terrifying. My dumbass got knocked up by my first serious bf and had my oldest at 19. I came so close to throwing away my scholarships and my (and my child's) future. And I had good parents with whom I had an open and supportive relationship! Oof, I hope my child is better than me!\nSorry for the word-vomit, you were just talking about dogs. Clearly,  I'm anxious. \ud83e\udee0"]}
