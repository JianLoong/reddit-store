Not necessarily an asshole but definitely oblivious.", "NTA. just stupid.\n\nyou should have offered a home-cooked meal.", "I wouldn't call you an AH, but you did came across as cheap.

You literally said you assumed since she didn\u2019t have money she couldn\u2019t pay to eat.  So it never once occurred to you to treat her dinner one time?  Like, you are dating someone and it just doesn\u2019t cross your mind that *you* could, just one time, pay for her to eat?  \n\nI think you are TA because you *knew* you could just order some pub food, but you *chose* to end the date instead.  You are so hung up on going 50/50 that you cannot envision a time when you would cover the entire bill. \n\nI also think you are TA because at a certain point in life, being that oblivious makes you an AH.  It means you are not making the effort.  You are just floating along with a complete lack of awareness of other people and the world in general.  \n\nI would be surprised if this woman continues to date you much longer.  You should at least send her a text apologizing for being so obtuse.

If she says she doesn\u2019t have the money, tell her you\u2019d be happy to cover her this time, but want to respect her feelings on having everything paid for by her ex. Let her decide after that.\n\nBecause it\u2019s possible she had the money for something small OR that her issue with her ex was that he got offended if he didn\u2019t fund everything. That\u2019s very different from needing to be careful with $ before payday or not wanting a guy to pay for you ever. \n\nIf you have questions, ask. It sounds like you\u2019re definitely listening and are even picking up on a lot of hints, which is awesome. But don\u2019t assume you know the whole story.
