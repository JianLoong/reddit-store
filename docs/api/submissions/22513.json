My fiance has a very big family (8 siblings, 17 nieces/nephews, and many cousins), and we wanted to stick to our wedding budget, so decided to make the event child free. The only children invited are from immediate family, we invited his nieces and nephews (not his cousin's kids). On my side of the family, my parents split when I was 6 and I have stepsiblings. I lived with my dad, and am close to my stepsisters (16 and 11) who I have invited to the wedding.\n\nMy mom never remarried, and has been dating her boyfriend for the past 3 years. He has two kids 14m 17m. I am not really close with them, my mom moved after the split and I used to spend summers with her and the rest of the year with my dad, but as I grew older I spent most my time with my dad and school friends, as my mom has a very demanding job and would barely be home when I would see her, so I started to see her some weekends. I call my mom about twice a week now but I would say I am only civil with her boyfriend and his kids. We have never really spent a lot of time together or got to know each other very well. I chose to invite my mom and her boyfriend, but not his kids. I don't know her boyfriend really well, and only invited him for my mom's sake.\n\nAfter sending the invite, my mom called me about me not inviting her boyfriend's kids, but when I explained she said she understood. She found out I invited my other stepsisters and texted me last night to say I am TA for not helping her boyfriend's kids feel like part of the family. She is now threatening not to come if I don't invite her whole family, as she will struggle to organise childcare for the kids. My family are split on this; some agree with my mom that I should invite the kids and keep the peace, but my fiance and some others thinks it's our wedding so I should just invite who I want, he also doesn't know my mom's boyfriend/ his kids very well, so he said he'll just back my decision and whatever I am comfortable with.\n\neta- I meant child free for the sake of not inviting kids of of extended family and acquantainces. There are kids at the wedding, but as I said they are immediate family and some of our friends' kids. We didn't call our wedding child free (I did in this post, however I have misunderstood what that means) and we did clarify on invites if we invited their kids or not.", "created_utc": 1689614785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152881a/aita_for_not_inviting_my_mums_boyfriends_children/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've already invited your 11 year-old stepsister, so you can't plausibly claim that children won't be attending.\n\nThat said, your budget is what it is, and you and your fianc\u00e9 get to decide who to invite. Everyone who is invited gets to decide for themselves whether or not to attend.\n\nYour mom's boyfriend's kids are not your stepsiblings. You don't know them well and don't have much of a relationship with them at all. What's more, a 17yo and a 14yo don't need childcare. If they have an emergency, they can call 911. They don't need an adult to be physically present with them all day, every day. So your mom's claim that arranging childcare would be too difficult doesn't hold water.\n\nWhen you were 17 or younger and visited your mom, did she ever leave you unsupervised? If so, even she will have to admit her excuse is BS.\n\nWeddings are expensive enough. Don't let her pressure you into inviting people you don't want to invite. If she makes the choice to not attend, that's on her, not you. It sounds like she's been too busy for years to maintain much of a relationship with you.
