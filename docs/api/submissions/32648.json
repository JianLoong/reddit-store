We had discussed in the past what each person\u2019s obligations would be before moving in together. I do most of the chores (laundry, dishes, etc) and he pays a larger amount on the bills. Part of that deal was that with the job I had previously, he would watch my daughter for me Tuesdays and Fridays when I worked nights (I had to work Saturdays so my parents took my daughter every weekend). We have his son week on week off. He did that till I got my new job a little over a month ago so really only had to watch them by himself for 2 months 2 days a week. \n\nTypically my boyfriend\u2019s mom watches his son on Saturdays when he works (usually mandatory overtime most weeks) from 5am-3pm then they usually have lunch afterwards at her house and he brings him back home afterwards.

Forget the past\u2026what is the arrangement now?  Are you expecting your boyfriend to watch your daughter at all?  If so, a reasonable expectation is for you to watch his son a similar amount of time.\n\nWhat you need to realize is g\u2019ma is probably done with being a free nanny to a non-verbal autistic kid who is getting stronger.  Society makes it challenging for people to admit that, so she is pawning him off on you.  That is the fact of being in a blended relationship that you need to work on with your boyfriend.  Either he cuts overtime down to watch his child, you agree to put forth more effort, or you guys separate.  \n\nAs it stands now, I am going with NAH, but you may be if you refuse to contribute equitably in this.", "Nta but God I wish ppl would use the right terms. This isnt ur step son. This is ur partners child. There's a difference. Like yall haven't even been together an yr and have only been living together for 3 months lol step children is a whole different level of responsibility", "Info:  what is your future plan with your boyfriend? You haven't been together that long and aren't a step mom.  You are just the girlfriend.  Do you see marriage in your future?", "I would rethink my living together. A non verbal autistic bigger child than yours can spell danger for your child. If you feel stressed now, at 3 1/2 years old, look to the future.\n\nBF's mom not helpful this early on..... you understand you will be stuck.\n\nYou need to reassess. Your child needs to be safe. Best of luck to you. Tough situation.", "Info if I am reading this correctly, he used to watch your daughter two days a week so you could work, and is now asking you for the two Saturdays a month he has his child? I can understand not wanting to do that forever, but if he did help you out maybe you could help him out as well? Sounds like his mom maybe needs a break?", "NTA. Signing up to be a step parent doesn't equate signing up for being a free day care.", "NTA, bc it has only been two months and things seem to have already changed.\n\nCircumstances change and can often evolve thru the course of a long-term, romantic relationship where children are involved.  As your partner's son ages, his behavior may change (like any other child) - for the better or worse.  It is also extremely likely that you will have to participate in this boy's upbringing as he gets older, including caring for him in his father's absence, whether you like it or not.  How long will Grandma be around to care for your partner's son?\n\nYou need to understand what his care entails, as it evolves, beyond what you typically expect for a child of his age. \n\nIf you are unprepared or unwilling to do that, time to end the relationship bc being a partner, means just that and you both seem unwilling to actually do that.", "Oh, wow! It sounds as though you're head over heels for this guy right now, but I can see major problems popping up in the future. It sounds to me also as though grandma is finding it hard to watch this non-verbal, autistic little boy (who's also very strong) from 5 a.m. until past 3:00 p.m., every Saturday that her son has the child. That's a long day, with a very early start, and I imagine she's ready for a break. However, you guys are in the very early days of your relationship and you're not his wife. Why would Grandma think that you should have any responsibility for this? \n\nI'm a little confused on the timeline of who has the little boy when, but no matter what I think you should be on the very bottom of the list of responsible people for him. This might not sound very nice, but chances are he's going to be more of a handful as he gets older. I've known a couple of people with autistic, non-verbal children, and it generally doesn't get easier, especially as they get older and develop definite minds of their own.  I hope for the little boy's sake that's not true in his case, but you need to bear in mind that there could be a great deal of caretaking involved in the future, and it might be very hard, so the issue of babysitting him is something that needs to be ironed out sooner rather than later.", "NTA - **Talk to your boyfriend and get this nipped in the bud.** \n\nYour role was agreed upon with your partner. MIL has an opinion but it does not make it right. Perhaps it alleviates her and his mom from caring for the child. Don't let her perspective take your free day. Everyone deserves time to recharge. Talk to your boyfriend and get this nipped in the bud.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe FAIR thing would be: Every hour day you watch your partner's kid in excahnge for the same time him watching your kid.", "Grandma has every right to be done caring for the child and may chose to see the kid more if that happens.  Grandparents are not free babysitters.  Girlfriends are not free babysitters.  Both can say no.  It's up to the parents to provide childcare and sometimes that is hiring someone or changing their work schedule.  The child needs his parents and stability and that may be more important thN overtime so he can pawn the kid off.\n\nNow, this child should be getting high-level therapy to improve his quality of life.  I'm concerned nothing like this is mentioned!  I think you need to be very realistic about this situation and how it will affect yours and your child's life.  This kid will always be dependent and will be become an adult sized body.  He will need a lot of care.   Be realistic to yourself.  You have the choice, the parents didn't.", "Soft yta you want to play house right? This is what the mom does.", "The important thing is you watch the kids an _equal_ amount to him or his proxy. Keeping in mind that taking care of a nonverbal autistic kid is much harder.\n\nAnd that you both get an equal amount of time off.\n\nIf that's not happening you need to renegotiate. Without involving his mom, who may be tired of helping him and wants you to take over.", "If y\u2019all were married YTA.  But y\u2019all aren\u2019t so definitely NTA.", "YTA.  It's not possible for you to live a child-free existence, unless you put up your own child for adoption.  Expecting someone else to go out of their way to watch boyfriend's kiddo when you are already there watching your own kiddo?  Ridiculous.", "Your boyfriend's mother has no right to tell the two of you how you should behave in your relationship and in your house. So you are NTA. That said, if you want to keep this relationship moving forward, you need to come to terms with the obligations of being a stepparent, which are the same obligations as being any other kind of parent. If you are not willing to take on that responsibility, you need to be honest with yourself and your boyfriend and end this relationship so all of you can start moving on with your lives.", "YTA for the hypocrisy. Your boyfriend watched your kid when you needed him to. You should be able to do the same for him.\n\nYou're also not a stepmother. This is your boyfriend of less than a year and his kid. You refuse to even watch the kid. It's insulting you consider him your stepson. You're also a shit mother for leaving your kid with your short-term boyfriend and moving in with your kid so quickly.", "NTA; the question here is why she thinks it\u2019s your job to watch his child now?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have no idea why I'm so invested in this, but I hope it all works out and a great solution is found.  Maybe like every other week if you do see yourself as a future step mom?", "Thats kinda what I was thinking too! Like every other time. It concerns me that his grandma doesn\u2019t want to ever see him (she only sees him really on holidays other than the weekends she watches him) and I might be projecting my own irritation since I\u2019m autistic myself."]}
