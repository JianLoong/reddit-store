My coteacher (34f) is very in-your-face, in-your-business and doesn't understand boundaries very well. She is always looking over my shoulder, she will straight up yank my laptop away from me and look at what I'm typing, if my phone goes off she goes \"oooh who is that?!\" and things of that nature. I've gently tried to explain to her that I don't want her touching my stuff like that, she'll say stuff like \"oh, well I'm an open book, it's no big deal!\" When I've explained less gently to her, she borderline cries and gets into an anxiety loop where she accuses me of being mean and/or mad at her.\n\nI'm currently in a long-distance relationship and my boyfriend and I rely a lot on sexting to keep our relationship fun. He's in a different time zone, so the things I send him at night won't get responses until the next morning some times. Today I noticed he was sending me (text) responses to photos I had taken last night about what they made him want to do with me. I want to point out quickly that there were no kids in the room at this time, and even if one had wandered in, they're too short to get my phone and too young to read. I decided to leave my phone on a tall standing desk by my own laptop while going to get a cup of coffee, knowing my coteacher would probably look at it.\n\nWhen I got back, my coteacher told me in a very serious voice that I need to be careful about what I am doing at work because she saw my disgusting and inappropriate texts. I told her she wouldn't have seen them if she hadn't been looking for them, and she said that wasn't the point, that she felt sexually harassed but wouldn't go to HR about it \"because the children wouldn't be able to handle a change in teachers.\" \n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1698359010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h8g6q/aita_for_leaving_sexuallyexplicit_messages_where/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
