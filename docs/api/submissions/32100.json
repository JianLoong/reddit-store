I would understand replacing the mattress if it looked like a murder scene from Patrick Bateman. \n\nUr sis is just wanting a new mattress for any reason. Replace the protector and leave. If those family members think it's such a big deal then they can replace it.", "NTA! Your sister is weird! Does she replace every panty she ever gets any blood on accidentally? How about her own mattress, because surely she's been in this situation before, too? Yes, it's a guest mattress and if you had bled all over it, I'd get her standpoint (though I still would never ask a guest to replace anything they accidentally broke or blemished.) However, as it is, you cleaned up and if you hadn's said anything in the first place, I'm sure she would never even have noticed it. \n\nIt baffles me that women/people who get their period get so agitated over menstruation.", "Lmao what. Mattresses get blood on them. It's just what happens. I'd wager pretty much everyone with a period has gotten blood on a mattress at some point -- if you are sleeping on a mattress that you didn't buy new and that anyone else has ever slept on, you should probably just assume that there's been blood on it at some point. NTA.", "NTA and your sister got a really poor mattress protector if you bled through it. Accidents happen and since it could be cleaned no big deal. Not only cleaned but it wasn't a huge spot. If it couldn't be cleaned or it was a big area I  would understand replacing it. Despite what people thing mattresses can be properly cleaned. Especially if you get a portable carpet cleaner or a steamer for clothes. If your sister lets this go and you sleep over on shark week put down a towel or two before you go to bed just in case.", "NTA. Mattresses are subject to bodily fluids, sorry - sweat, blood and piss are all to be expected in the lifetime of a mattress. A hotel would not charge you for the mattress for this reason. \n\nIt is not less functional as a mattress, it isn\u2019t a health risk as it\u2019s been properly cleaned and will be covered by a mattress protector. Further, the disposal of a mattress within its lifespan is detrimental to the planet.", "NTA. What kind of person can afford a new mattress every time it gets a bit dirty? \n\nYou cleaned it and replaced the protector. Good job done.", "NTA\n\nIt's a fucking ridiculous demand. Cleaning the stain and replacing the protector is enough.", "NTA. You cleaned the stain and offered to replace the mattress protector, which, quite frankly, is more than a lot of folks would do for such a small, common thing. It really does sound like your sister is just trying to get a new mattress out of you and, at this point, that's just flat-out unreasonable.", "NTA.  These sorts of accidents happen.  You cleaned the mattress and have offered to pay to replace the mattress protector.  You made it right and that's more than reasonable.  Asking a guest to pay full price to replace a mattress that is clean and will have a new mattress protector is entirely unreasonable.", "NTA. A thoroughly cleaned mattress is enough. Though I am slightly weirded out by how many people in the comments are regularly bleeding through \u201cmattress protectors\u201d onto their mattresses. Are y\u2019all confusing these with fitted sheets?? A proper mattress protector should be at least reasonably waterproof. You shouldn\u2019t be bleeding through them unless you\u2019re bleeding out!\n\nI have very heavy periods and have bled through a lot of things but never a whole ass mattress protector! :O", "NTA. It\u2019s clean now no harm done. Sounds like she\u2019s trying to get a free mattress out of you.", "NTA. She's your sister, not your landlord. Periods suck but they happen. You did your best to clean it up, she as a woman should understand that you weren't purposely trying to ruin her belongings. I think buying a new mattress protector suffices. If you really want to, you could offer to get it professionally cleaned.", "NTA. Your sister is horrible", "NtA...but I have a cunning plan. \nBuy the new mattress for your sis, and keep her at a distance.\nTake the old mattress, clean and sanitise and sell it to recoup your costs. \nIf you're buying her a new mattress, then the one that's old is now yours", "Info : How do you get the blood off ? Like, what's the recipe ?", "I'd say take a picture of the cleaned mattress. And ask if she can point out the stain, and if she can show you exactly where the stain is, fine. If not and it's a vague answer or anything that doesn't specifically point out the stain, then she's fussing over nothing. You can ask anyone who says your should replace it too.\n\nMattresses get stains on them. If she doesn't want it she should have gotten a water proof mattress protector.", "NTA\n\nCleaning mattress is enough. If the stain was directly on mattress instead of protector replacement would make sense.\n\nIgnore the relatives (cause there literally is no solution with family at times)\n\nAlso if you can, please tell me how you got the stains off the mattress  would make my life much easier", "NTA, I think she's just after a new mattress and it's convenient for her for it to be at your expense. \n\nTelling everyone in the family about a guest's nighttime period overspill is really not classy, too.", "Your sister is being pathetic", "NTA - Accidents happen, you went out of your way to fix the situation, she\u2019s being really unfair and trying to get something out of you - telling your family is also really unhelpful.", "NTA! Does she ask sweaty guests to replace mattresses after they have stayed? You cleaned the blood off, you're replacing the protector. Its pressumably her guest bed so unlikely she'll be sleeping in it.", "NTA - as a man I would say it is a little bit of blood, happened to tons of women I know, and it is not really that bad unless you have hemophobia.\n\nAnd since you were able to clean the mattress properly it should be a no brainer.", "NTA.  Yellow her to flip the mattress \n And yes buy her a mattress protector that repels liquid.", "NTA. It's 100% cleanable. My fianc\u00e9e was so embarrassed the first time it happened when we first lived together. But it's natural and it can happen randomly. Your sister is being pedantic.", "NTA \n\nYou cleaned it and replaced the mattress protector. i think it's ridiculous that she wants you to replace a mattress that has a speck of blood on that is now no longer there. Sounds like she wants a new mattress and this is her chance to get you to pay for it", "NTA.\n\nI mean I could understand if a person has OCD....but like besides that, there has to be something more behind this.\n\nYour sister is being ridiculous.\n\nNo one is EVER going to see through the cover. Is the cover not then covered by sheets and blankets? Like WTF? These guests have X-Ray vision or something? Cause then maybe you should pay.\n\n\\*What if that was her? Is she just going buy a new mattress anytime an accident occurs?\n\nIt's a shame for this to happen over something so FUCKING pointless OP, but yeah. We're all going to die one day, and this is the hill that's being died on? Not that I blame you, I wouldn't pay that....because buying a new mattress for her is resolving nothing.", "NTA. The mattress had a teeny tiny stain that you cleaned effectively. It's not a stain any more. It is an ex stain. It is a stain that has gone to meet its maker.\n\nArguing over a stain that doesn't exist is just stupid and wasteful. You should have taken photographs and sent them to everyone in the family, asking them to point out where the stain was!\n\nAlso? Even if your cleaning had left a little discolouration, as long as it's small (and therefore didn't seep through too many layers of material), the mattress isn't ruined. It's a guest mattress which always has a protector over it. No-one is going to see it. And frankly, if you were my sister, I would have been just fine with a well-laundered mattress protector rather than a replacement. Blood isn't some kind of magic pollutant that forever taints anything it once touched; it's just another of life's messes that you clean up.", "NTA \n\nYou wanna know why? My dog, my full grown dog pissed on my bed and i cleaned my mattress, i didn't get a new one, slapped some sheets over it and it was good, the my other dog, gave birth on the same mattress, cleaned it and slapped some sheets on top, you never knew. I must have bled on that thing at least ten times, and i just cleaned it, put a sheet on and was good, once a sheet is on stains dont matter anymore.\n\nI now have a new mattress for completely unrelated reasons.", "NTA. Did everyone in the family tell her she was being ridiculous?", "I\u2019m just\u2026\u2026your sister has periods right? Like this happens to every single person who gets periods. It happens more than once in their life. Hell it\u2019s happened more than once to me this year. And no one I\u2019ve ever met, certainly no one sane, replaces their mattress over a small period stain. Or even a large period stain. And more to the point, there is no damn stain anymore because you got it out. Maybe she should\u2019ve had a better mattress protector if it\u2019s that big of a deal to her. So much NTA. Your sister sounds unhinged and your family either doesn\u2019t have the full story or is just as unhinged", "NTA \n\nMattresses can be cleaned. She just wants a new mattress.", "NTA.\n\nDoes your sister not have monthly bodily moments? Is it a shock to her that these even occur?\n\nAnd it\u2019s your sister! Not a random friend of the family or something. It\u2019s literally your own blood relative.", "NTA, you did everything you could to remedy the situation. You were proactive and thorough and what more could reasonably be expected of you?\n\nI deem it possible that your sister wanted to get rid of that mattress anyway and that she now had an extra reason to replace it, as well as someone to bankroll her.", "NTA\n\nReplacing the mattress protector and cleaning up the mattress is a perfectly reasonable solution.\n\nReplacing the whole mattress is not.", "very slight YTA.\n\nif the stain is TOTALLY gone, i mean not even a small lightest shade of yellow mark that you can only see if you focus, then i can understand why you don't want to buy a new one.\n\nbut it's her mattress and you were a guest so if you do damage, you have to cover for it. also some people might find such things bothering/disgusting. if she asks, you just have to buy it, that's the end of discussion.", "Tell your sister that if she hadn\u2019t cheaped out and got a mattress protector that actually DID ITS JOB then this wouldn\u2019t even have been an issue.\n\nNTA.
