If those family members think it's such a big deal then they can replace it.", "NTA! Your sister is weird! Does she replace every panty she ever gets any blood on accidentally? How about her own mattress, because surely she's been in this situation before, too? Yes, it's a guest mattress and if you had bled all over it, I'd get her standpoint (though I still would never ask a guest to replace anything they accidentally broke or blemished.) However, as it is, you cleaned up and if you hadn's said anything in the first place, I'm sure she would never even have noticed it. \n\nIt baffles me that women/people who get their period get so agitated over menstruation.", "Lmao what. Mattresses get blood on them. It's just what happens. I'd wager pretty much everyone with a period has gotten blood on a mattress at some point -- if you are sleeping on a mattress that you didn't buy new and that anyone else has ever slept on, you should probably just assume that there's been blood on it at some point.

The mattress had a teeny tiny stain that you cleaned effectively. It's not a stain any more. It is an ex stain. It is a stain that has gone to meet its maker.\n\nArguing over a stain that doesn't exist is just stupid and wasteful. You should have taken photographs and sent them to everyone in the family, asking them to point out where the stain was!\n\nAlso? Even if your cleaning had left a little discolouration, as long as it's small (and therefore didn't seep through too many layers of material), the mattress isn't ruined. It's a guest mattress which always has a protector over it. No-one is going to see it. And frankly, if you were my sister, I would have been just fine with a well-laundered mattress protector rather than a replacement.

My dog, my full grown dog pissed on my bed and i cleaned my mattress, i didn't get a new one, slapped some sheets over it and it was good, the my other dog, gave birth on the same mattress, cleaned it and slapped some sheets on top, you never knew.
