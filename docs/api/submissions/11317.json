You're fortunate he took you in and gave you a good life.\n\nI'm not giving a judgment because you were so young when traumatized. Based on the ages of your nephews, it sounds like brother and wife had a toddler and weren't prepared to have another child in the house. \n\nForgiveness is good for your soul; not a suggestion to let them move in, just something that might help you.", "I would say you are N T A for your feelings--your full brother didn't care about you when you really needed help after the death of your parents.  It's only human to not be concerned for the situation of those who have been uncaring about us.  However, your half brother is a good person who stepped up and is trying to help again out of the goodness of his heart.  You might think about responding to this situation in a manner consistent with the values he demonstrated for you.\n\nI agree that having four more people in the house (one of them a 17 year old who has been raised by a probably selfish father) isn't going to be fun.  It's going to be incumbent upon your half brother to make sure that you and the rest of his family are not unnecessarily hassled, made uncomfortable or otherwise unable to enjoy life in the home because of these new guests.  That includes making sure there is an exit strategy and timeline rather than letting this turn into a permanent affair such as yours did.  He undertook to raise you, a child who was in no way able to look after himself; his brother is already an adult who needs to get his crap together and manage his own life affairs, not mooch off others long term.  I would also point out that at 24, you are old enough to start looking at moving out on your own and becoming independent as well.", "It\u2019s not your house so are you really in the position to make decisions here?

Thats a very big decision. Also is this your house or your brother\u2019s house?", "NAH.

Or did he just do it, not because he owed you anything, but because it was the right thing to do.\n\nSoft YTA, not because you owe your second brother, but because you have a chance to be better. I understand you\u2019re still stinging from the way you were treated.

Honestly it would be hard to help someone that walked away from you. I had a person tell me there are no coincidences in life. In this situation you got to know and have an awesome relationship with your brother. You also got to see the true meaning of family( doesn\u2019t mater if your related, full or half siblings). Family is there for you no mater what. \n\nWith this being said. I would suggest therapy. You lost your parents at a early age and where rejected by the 2 people you where closest too. You need to work through that. And working through those emotions doesn\u2019t mean forgiving your brother or sister. It means healing you.

You resent your 2nd brother for practically abandoning you 13 years ago and him not contacting you throughout the years isn\u2019t helpful towards him and just gives you an extra reason for resentment which you're totally entitled to..

Your HB wants to help him regardless which proves how awesome he is just like how he was with you and that's admirable and he's respecting your opinion here which adds more bous to his awesomeness..\nSo hear me out... First things first you need therapy as your childhood was traumatizing given the deaths and abandonment so I think it'll help you heal... Secondly I think that having a conversation with the second brother can be helpful regarding the past issueas to why he decided to do what he did as to find some sort of closure.. Another suggestion would be not dealing with him or being limited and formal in your talks with his family to ultimately avoid any unnecessary shit from him...\nAnd finally have you considered moving out or HB finding a small apartment for second brother?

Was he financially stable to take care of himself, let alone you?\n\nIn general, you shouldn't be required to help your brother in such a substantial way, so you're making a decision you have every right to make.

I think it\u2019s easy for us to look at that and say \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done that at 23,\u201d but OP was right to want their siblings to sacrifice for them, and they\u2019re within their rights to hold on to the grudge. Actions have sometimes quite far reaching consequences.", "Agreed. He definitely didn\u2019t care enough to keep in touch. OP has been living with his older brother for years and the older brother said \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to force us give up our space\u201d meaning OP has a choice and he chose no.", "I mean, he didn't? Maybe his choice would have been different if that brother had been the op's only option, but the oldest made it very clear he wanted to take him. If the brother in question knew he'd struggle to take care of the op but there was another more capable option, why shouldn't he let the oldest take him?", "I think people are being a bit unrealistic with you. He left you behind, at age 10. Yes you need to learn to give that resentment a place. But for yourself, for your own rest. However, helping someone who did that to you? Of course not. Let him lay in the bed he made for himself. I am seriously amazed by the answers. The \"burn the witch\" hunts I have seen here and now you're supposed to help someone who didn't care to leave you to the system. The audacity of these people.", "He didn't know. Or are you calling OP a liar?", "Just to add, your half-brother took you in when he didn't have to. \n\nYour NTA for your feelings.  You might be for influencing your niece in a way that contradicts your brothers belief system.\n\nYou say his your half- brother who you didn't know very well.

So sad really.", "Esh", "I know you despise your brother, but for Gods sake. We all have to grow up as people, you should definitely leave the past behind but obviously never forget.

Never forget, but be kind.", "YTA\n\nYou admitted you had a good life with your half brother so honestly your other brother did you a favor.

After reading all your replies, YTA. The way you speak sounds like you're still a teenager, but you're 23. Why haven't you moved out? Why aren't you independent by now? After all, according to you, a 23yr old should be more than prepared to take in a 10yr old. So why are you still dependent on your brother? Why aren't you out there living independently?", "NTA \n\nI would offer to take the kids in like a decent family member would do and like they didn\u2019t do for you. Fuck the adults. Your bro was 23 had a kid, a wife and just got inheritance. Way more than enough to help and not send you to foster care. \n\nBut I\u2019m all for not having to suffer just because someone else did. The kids are innocent but also not your problem so do what feels right.", "It\u2019s not your house or decision to help.

I\u2019m not saying abandoning you was right because it wasn\u2019t but they are the age you are now. \n\nWould you be okay with a 10 year old just sprung on you after your parents passed? It\u2019s a tricky situation and I\u2019m glad your oldest brother stepped up. \n\nI just wouldn\u2019t kick your other brother to the curb while him not taking you in and talking to you he\u2019s had his own life and own struggles going on.

Asking someone to take in and raise a child is a signifacant strain, and while it sucks that he wasn't able or willing to, you are being asked for the inconvience of sharing a bedroom at worst. It's not just your brother who will suffer here, his children will too.", "ESH, it's really crappy to hold that strong of a grudge over siblings that had also lost your parents not being able to raise a young kid!", "This is tough. Your older brother didn't take you in when you lost your parents and didn't care to really keep contact. I can see why you're so upset. You in a way lost your family and your life as you knew it imploded. Maybe before you make your Decision you can ask your brother for a sit down and talk about how you felt when everything went down and try to get some answers? Or maybe his side of things? He lost his parents just like you did.", "NTA, but you\u2019re basically having the same I\u2019m not going to inconvenience my life for you attitude they had when you were younger and while I\u2019ll agree turn about is fair play (hence the NTA), if you really ponder it\u2026 if your older brother had that attitude when you were younger, you wouldn\u2019t be in his home.

Your older brother took care of you at your lowest and now he wants to do the same for your other brother. It's not fair to let your own personal resentment get in the way of him trying to do a good thing. \n\nMOST IMPORTANT though... You're willing to put innocent children who did nothing to you on the street just to be petty. Being a good person means doing things you don't like sometimes for the greater good.

But, I can't get behind OP's behaviour. \n\nIt's OP's brother's home. I imagine this was more of a question posed to the brother's children regarding their comfort with having house guests, since OP is 24 year old man and far from a child.

Alas, I rarely aim so high as my trauma enjoys the taste of petty. But sometimes I'm also simply setting a boundary between me and trauma. My first thought when I read OPs post was that they were trying to keep a boundary between them and someone that hurt them. Imagine if you were 10 and your parents suddenly died. And the siblings you really wanted to be with, and thought they in return wanted you, turned you away. And on top of all of that, you have to leave a familiar place. That has got to be immensely painful. \n\nI suspect there's more to how it all went down than we know too. I can too well imagine how easily the younger siblings just assumed the oldest would take OP in. After all, \"he's the oldest\".
