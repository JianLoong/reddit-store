You're fortunate he took you in and gave you a good life.\n\nI'm not giving a judgment because you were so young when traumatized. Based on the ages of your nephews, it sounds like brother and wife had a toddler and weren't prepared to have another child in the house. \n\nForgiveness is good for your soul; not a suggestion to let them move in, just something that might help you.", "I would say you are N T A for your feelings--your full brother didn't care about you when you really needed help after the death of your parents.  It's only human to not be concerned for the situation of those who have been uncaring about us.  However, your half brother is a good person who stepped up and is trying to help again out of the goodness of his heart.  You might think about responding to this situation in a manner consistent with the values he demonstrated for you.\n\nI agree that having four more people in the house (one of them a 17 year old who has been raised by a probably selfish father) isn't going to be fun.  It's going to be incumbent upon your half brother to make sure that you and the rest of his family are not unnecessarily hassled, made uncomfortable or otherwise unable to enjoy life in the home because of these new guests.  That includes making sure there is an exit strategy and timeline rather than letting this turn into a permanent affair such as yours did.  He undertook to raise you, a child who was in no way able to look after himself; his brother is already an adult who needs to get his crap together and manage his own life affairs, not mooch off others long term.  I would also point out that at 24, you are old enough to start looking at moving out on your own and becoming independent as well.", "It\u2019s not your house so are you really in the position to make decisions here?

Thats a very big decision. Also is this your house or your brother\u2019s house?", "NAH.

Or did he just do it, not because he owed you anything, but because it was the right thing to do.\n\nSoft YTA, not because you owe your second brother, but because you have a chance to be better. I understand you\u2019re still stinging from the way you were treated.

Honestly it would be hard to help someone that walked away from you. I had a person tell me there are no coincidences in life. In this situation you got to know and have an awesome relationship with your brother. You also got to see the true meaning of family( doesn\u2019t mater if your related, full or half siblings). Family is there for you no mater what. \n\nWith this being said. I would suggest therapy. You lost your parents at a early age and where rejected by the 2 people you where closest too. You need to work through that. And working through those emotions doesn\u2019t mean forgiving your brother or sister. It means healing you.

You resent your 2nd brother for practically abandoning you 13 years ago and him not contacting you throughout the years isn\u2019t helpful towards him and just gives you an extra reason for resentment which you're totally entitled to..

Your HB wants to help him regardless which proves how awesome he is just like how he was with you and that's admirable and he's respecting your opinion here which adds more bous to his awesomeness..\nSo hear me out... First things first you need therapy as your childhood was traumatizing given the deaths and abandonment so I think it'll help you heal... Secondly I think that having a conversation with the second brother can be helpful regarding the past issueas to why he decided to do what he did as to find some sort of closure.. Another suggestion would be not dealing with him or being limited and formal in your talks with his family to ultimately avoid any unnecessary shit from him...\nAnd finally have you considered moving out or HB finding a small apartment for second brother?

Was he financially stable to take care of himself, let alone you?\n\nIn general, you shouldn't be required to help your brother in such a substantial way, so you're making a decision you have every right to make.

Sounds like you don\u2019t really have a relationship with the brother who didn\u2019t take you in & aren\u2019t really in contact with him much so it seems to make sense to me that you wouldn\u2019t want to live with a stranger who wouldn\u2019t do the same for you if the shoe was on the other foot.", "I find it sad that you haven't learned from your brother to give a chance to people you don't know.\nI understand you felt rejected by your other siblings but you don't tell us how old they were. Most people in their teenage years, or even early twenties would feel daunting to take charge of a baby when they're barely supporting themselves. \n\nPlus you're only asked to share a house for a time, while this can make a huge difference for them. \nI'll go with YTA", "NTA. Your brother didn't have to take you cause raising a child is hard, especially for someone who was just 23 years old. But at the same time, I think every action has consequences. It's oke for your brother to not take you in the same way it's oke for you to not want your brother to move in to live with you and your hb.", "YTA\n\nTo put things in perspective, you are mad than when your brother was 23 and you were 10 he didn\u2019t take you in, upend his life, and financially support you to make sure you\u2019d stay out of the system.\n\nNow you are 24 and unwilling to give up a gaming room so that your 11 and 17 year old nephews won\u2019t be homeless. Have you compared your behavior to the behavior of your 23 year old brother and 26 year old half brother all those years ago? Who do you want to be more like?\n\nI feel like you learned the wrong lesson. Instead of learning how a generous person like your half brother can change the trajectory of someone\u2019s life, you just want retribution on your brother and don\u2019t care that his wife and children will also suffer in the process. And it seems like you want your brother to suffer a worse fate than you did; you did end up with a home while you basically just don\u2019t care what happens to his family.\n\nLook, I understand you are hurt and you don\u2019t have to forgive your brother. But I do think it\u2019s AH behavior to stand in the way of someone else\u2019s generosity, especially when the sacrifices are mild, and especially when you\u2019re a 24 year old that could move out at any time. If you can\u2019t stand to see your brother I think you should look for other housemates.", "NTA!", "I think your older brother is probably disappointed that when given the opportunity, you chose to act just like your other siblings instead of the example he set. You are ALL lucky to have him in your life.", "YTA. Your eldest brother is awesome. What a guy. How can you not try to be like him. Stop being selfish. Think about the luck you had when you needed it. It\u2019s not about quid pro quo as you\u2019ve done nothing for anyone else either. You have nephews and you are being a TA.\n\nGrow up. You were given a break, give one back. You sound like a spoiled entitled brat. At 24 you should have moved out anyway.", ">My brother said he is a bit disappointed but won't force us to do anything however my second brother and his wife think we are selfish assholes\n\nOP, Please you are NTA, you have every right to be angry sad and feel abandoned. That said, you seem like you know how that feels, I want to appeal to your good side and remember that those nephews of yours, though you might not know them, are innocent. \n\nPlease do it for them and break the cycle of abandonment and you don't have to talk to your brother or like him, heck you can ignore him and just focus on yourself and your other brother who was there for you.", "Clearly NTA.\n\nYou have been asked, you have been honest. You made your boundaries clear.", "I would be so disappointed if I was half brother", "If your eldest brother and his wife died right now, do you think you could take care of and provide for yourself and their 2 children? Because this all hinges on whether you think you would be able to do what you resent your second brother for not doing.", "[removed]", "Why are you acting like not taking his little brother in after their parents died is no big deal when it's actually reprehensible?", "That\u2019s BS they were maybe OPs age now who\u2019s not even on his own yet (even tho he also got a large inheritance) could he take on the care of a \u201cvery young\u201d dependent? No he couldn\u2019t but you expect them to have been able to, Hell OP has the choice right now with ZERO extra cost to him and he won\u2019t do it,", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
