You're fortunate he took you in and gave you a good life.\n\nI'm not giving a judgment because you were so young when traumatized. Based on the ages of your nephews, it sounds like brother and wife had a toddler and weren't prepared to have another child in the house. \n\nForgiveness is good for your soul; not a suggestion to let them move in, just something that might help you.", "I would say you are N T A for your feelings--your full brother didn't care about you when you really needed help after the death of your parents.  It's only human to not be concerned for the situation of those who have been uncaring about us.  However, your half brother is a good person who stepped up and is trying to help again out of the goodness of his heart.  You might think about responding to this situation in a manner consistent with the values he demonstrated for you.\n\nI agree that having four more people in the house (one of them a 17 year old who has been raised by a probably selfish father) isn't going to be fun.  It's going to be incumbent upon your half brother to make sure that you and the rest of his family are not unnecessarily hassled, made uncomfortable or otherwise unable to enjoy life in the home because of these new guests.  That includes making sure there is an exit strategy and timeline rather than letting this turn into a permanent affair such as yours did.  He undertook to raise you, a child who was in no way able to look after himself; his brother is already an adult who needs to get his crap together and manage his own life affairs, not mooch off others long term.  I would also point out that at 24, you are old enough to start looking at moving out on your own and becoming independent as well.", "It\u2019s not your house so are you really in the position to make decisions here?

Thats a very big decision. Also is this your house or your brother\u2019s house?", "NAH.

Or did he just do it, not because he owed you anything, but because it was the right thing to do.\n\nSoft YTA, not because you owe your second brother, but because you have a chance to be better. I understand you\u2019re still stinging from the way you were treated.

Honestly it would be hard to help someone that walked away from you. I had a person tell me there are no coincidences in life. In this situation you got to know and have an awesome relationship with your brother. You also got to see the true meaning of family( doesn\u2019t mater if your related, full or half siblings). Family is there for you no mater what. \n\nWith this being said. I would suggest therapy. You lost your parents at a early age and where rejected by the 2 people you where closest too. You need to work through that. And working through those emotions doesn\u2019t mean forgiving your brother or sister. It means healing you.

You resent your 2nd brother for practically abandoning you 13 years ago and him not contacting you throughout the years isn\u2019t helpful towards him and just gives you an extra reason for resentment which you're totally entitled to.. Plus I don't think he has the right to call you \"selfish AH\" \nHowever.. Your HB wants to help him regardless which proves how awesome he is just like how he was with you and that's admirable and he's respecting your opinion here which adds more bous to his awesomeness..\nSo hear me out... First things first you need therapy as your childhood was traumatizing given the deaths and abandonment so I think it'll help you heal... Secondly I think that having a conversation with the second brother can be helpful regarding the past issueas to why he decided to do what he did as to find some sort of closure.. Another suggestion would be not dealing with him or being limited and formal in your talks with his family to ultimately avoid any unnecessary shit from him...\nAnd finally have you considered moving out or HB finding a small apartment for second brother?

Was he financially stable to take care of himself, let alone you?\n\nIn general, you shouldn't be required to help your brother in such a substantial way, so you're making a decision you have every right to make.

Similar to most strangers, I'd imagine.", "I feel it was also that the 2nd brother made no effort to maintain a relationship with OP, over the years as well, not just the original abandonment.", "The other brother didn\u2019t even bother keeping in touch with him when he was younger. What makes you think second brother cared about him in the first place ?", "OP\u2019s not being too hard. I think it\u2019s easy for us to look at that and say \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done that at 23,\u201d but OP was right to want their siblings to sacrifice for them, and they\u2019re within their rights to hold on to the grudge. Actions have sometimes quite far reaching consequences.", "Agreed. He definitely didn\u2019t care enough to keep in touch. OP has been living with his older brother for years and the older brother said \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to force us give up our space\u201d meaning OP has a choice and he chose no.", "I mean, he didn't? Maybe his choice would have been different if that brother had been the op's only option, but the oldest made it very clear he wanted to take him. If the brother in question knew he'd struggle to take care of the op but there was another more capable option, why shouldn't he let the oldest take him?", "I think people are being a bit unrealistic with you. He left you behind, at age 10. Yes you need to learn to give that resentment a place. But for yourself, for your own rest. However, helping someone who did that to you? Of course not. Let him lay in the bed he made for himself. I am seriously amazed by the answers. The \"burn the witch\" hunts I have seen here and now you're supposed to help someone who didn't care to leave you to the system. The audacity of these people.", "He didn't know. Or are you calling OP a liar?", "Just to add, your half-brother took you in when he didn't have to. \n\nYour NTA for your feelings.  You might be for influencing your niece in a way that contradicts your brothers belief system.\n\nYou say his your half- brother who you didn't know very well. His not that much older than your siblings, you don't know what kind of relationship he had with your parents, but he was there for you.\n\nEdit: fixed typo", "I think this is one of the most astute comments I've read in a long time. What kind of person does OP want to be though?", "Not everyone reads every comment...", "It's literally in the comment chain so that would just be lazy as fuck."]}
