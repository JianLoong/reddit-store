One time me and my dad were planning on going to the drive in, and my dad stupidly told her. She asked if her kids could be incluided too.

I told everyone to clear their schedules for Friday afternoon because I didn\u2019t want anyone to feel left out. Well, that\u2019s where I messed up, because my dad told my aunt and told her she could tag along WITHOUT TELLING ME!!!\n\nWe showed up to Olive Garden at around 4:30pm and I asked to a table for 5 (Me, My dad, my two sisters and my grandpa) but my dad said that if they could make it a table for 12, I asked why and that\u2019s when he told me.

Paying for 5 people you invited and paying for an extra 6 someone else invited, are 2 very different scenarios. \n\nYour dad is way out of line expecting this to be on your dime. \n\nNTA - and you need to caveat future invitations by stating the guest list is closed and if dad protests, he can be off the list too until he learns his lesson. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're aunt is obviously an asshole, but so is your dad! The fact that he's done the same thing multiple times shows a complete lack of care.", "1) Your dad invited her without consulting you. She is HIS guest. He is responsible for her and either she pays, or he pays. \n\n2) If he is mad having to pay, then he clearly knows the situation is unfair and has no right to expect you to pay. \n\n3) Since this clearly a whole pathology with your dad and his sister, anytime there are plans, even if she isn\u2019t invited (yet), you need to get in the habit of explicitly saying \u201conly X, Y, and Z are invited not Aunt\u201d and/or \u201cI will not (or will) be covering the cost for Aunt.\u201d Don\u2019t wait for the bill or the resentment that bonding time has been crashed\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA\n\nYour Dad invited them behind your back, it is only right he pays for them.\n\nThe AH here is your Dad and your Aunt.\n\nYou did the right thing, perhaps your Dad will learn to keep his mouth shut.", "NTA.

Stop inviting your dad if it includes his sister and her kids.", "Inviting other people at the outing you had planned without even asking is already not cool, to put it mildy. Inviting someone your little sister doesn't like at the outing you had planned to celebrate her accomplishment is AH behavior. Expecting you to pay for 7 people you haven't invited there after springing it on you at the last minute is outrageous. NTA at all and good for you, for standing your ground.

If he invited them, he should have paid for them.", "Wow reading this made my blood boil. Your Dad is a massive asshole who has major boundary issues. And I would encourage you to put your foot down with him each time he pulls something like this, since HE is the one one with the big mouth inviting her without checking why you first. He\u2019s the one giving your entitled, freeloading aunt the idea that it\u2019s okay for her to crash your family events while everybody else pays her way. I would also explicitly make it clear to your aunt that she is NOT invited to your events. If she shows up, kick her out. Ignore her manipulation and tantrums. Do not give in.

He should have been prepared to pay for her!", "Wow.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour Dad invited her, enables her, and if he's going to to that he has to pay for her. Make absolutely clear that this is the way it is going to be, so any time he pulls this crap again, he's aware that he is on the hook for it.\n\nTerrible that your Dad wasn't paying for his own daughter's celebration anyway. And the fact he used your social embarrassment to try to get you to go along with everything - from not telling you he invited her until it's in front of everybody, to trying to shame you when you say you won't pay. Just awful.", "NTA - I'd stop inviting or including your Dad. Doesn't sound like he adds much besides stress and frustration.", "OP, NTA. AND you ended up with the PERFECT outcome.\n\nThe real culprit and Ahole in all of this is the person who had to pay the bill - your dad. DO NOT REIMBURSE HIM.\n\nYour dad actually initiates telling his sister. He sees an opportunity for her to freeload off of you (or others) and lets her know. He enables your aunt to be the obnoxious freeloader that she is.\n\nIt's not your job to tiptoe around your dad, so make a clear and open announcement to your grandpa, your dad, your two sisters, your aunt, and all the adult cousins: If you plan an event and haven't specifically invited someone, then they are not invited. If your dad chooses to invite additional people, then who pays their share of the bill is between those people and your dad. If they find that rude, tell them it is even ruder to (1) come uninvited by the host, (2) to come uninvited by the host AND expect free anything, (3) to not be the host and invite others to crash an event, and (4) to not be the host and invite others to crash the event AND expect the host to provide for the even-crashers.\n\nAll that goes for dinners out, for dinners in, for parties you host, for going to movies and other entertainment. It even goes for things that don't cost - don't come if the host didn't invite you.\n\nYour aunt is a mooch, but your dad is guy who opens the back door for her and invites her in.\n\nP.S. You don't say how your cousins are. If they show that they are not like their mom (or - like your dad - inclined to open the back door for their mom), then I hope you can build your own relationships with them.", "Easiest NTA. Your dad is an enabler and if he wants to support his sister with his money he can, but you don\u2019t have to. Good job on celebrating your sister!", "NTA. Your dad invited her, so it should be on him.", "This is insane. This is entirely your father's fault, it's exactly right that he should be the one to pay for them.", "Nta. Nobody likes gatecrashers. Since your dad invited your aunt and her 5 kids without telling you, he should pay her share", "NTA your dad invited his sister. He should pay for her. He was definitely TA for inviting 6 additional people and expecting you to pay. Let\u2019s hope he learned his lesson.", "NTA. Your dad invited her then it\u2019s his responsibility to pay for her if she doesn\u2019t. Who invites people on someone else\u2019s dime?", "NTA\n\nYour Dad invited your aunt so it's his responsibility to pay for her", "NTA. Guess dad decided to pull a fast one and shot himself in the foot. If he wants to treat his mooch of a sister he can, but he can't expect you to pay for it.", "NTA, and frankly, I\u2019d tell your dad AND her that the next time she shows up, they need to figure out how her and her kids are being paid for because it\u2019s not on your dime.", "NTA\n\nYour dad decided it was such a great idea to invite a freeloader to eat without telling you until it was the last minute, even though you were the one paying and he knows you and your sister don't get along with her, he's an AH for inviting her on special trips and outings that are meant just for your family.\nYou said you don't like this aunt, why don't you jusy go LC with her? You need to put your foot down, tell your dad you don't want him to invite her again on anything planned for your family, and that if kept doing that, then you will no longer feel obligated to attend or pay, tell him that seeing her on holiday gatherings is more than enough, and if he wants to be around her more, then he should just plan things for the two of them and her kids and pay for it himself, I doubt he would if she always keep ordering more and more expensive food when others are paying.\nIt's unfortunate that she's not in a good financial situation, but that doesn't mean she can take advantage of people around her, you're not obligated to buy her anything, no one is, maybe she should have thought of that before having so many children and then expecting people to pay for her expenses.", ">Now my dad is calling me an asshole because he had to pay for it with his credit card.\n\nHE invited her. HE did that. That is his fault. In fact all of this bs that keeps happening is because of him. I read your comments. Cut!him!off! He was paying for her to do stuff when you all didn't have food. Did you post this just to show to him? Because NTA. He is definitely TA!!!", "NTA.  And in a way, this is a good thing - you were able to put your food down and now your father knows that if he invites her unilaterally, that is on him.  This actually makes things much easier for you to just mention it (her or your father paying for herself) next time she joins, or for having him rethink inviting her to begin with. And mention it early and repeatedly. \n\nYour dad is a piece of work.  Your invitation was clearly for the people YOU invited.  Naturally it did not include people you did not invite, much less people you did not even know were coming.  Your father fucked around and found out.  And I doubt he will forget it given that it cost him $300.  He has to put his money where his mouth is, and I am sure it stung. He deserves it.\n\nBy the way, is your grandfather father to both your father and your aunt? What does he think of this situation?", "Nope right response also tell her to her face in front of Dad you think she is a freeloader, that never pays for anything and let him deal with it.  He wants to create this conflict let it boil over on his lap.  Secondly next sister accomplishment don\u2019t invite mom and dad just take her out yourself.  When asked why just say I don\u2019t think you understand boundaries so I\u2019m celebrating with just us.", "NTA - I would\u2019ve just walked out before dinner when they showed up. Flat out said \u201cyou weren\u2019t even invited why are you here.\u201d", "NTA \n\nFFS your dad added 7 people to the check.  Let him pay for it.  You didn't invite them he clearly did.\n\nI had a step mom with your dad's same problem.  She tried to give away my BMX trick bike.  I bought with money I earned from cutting lawns and delivering papers all summer.  \n\nHer justification was that I was a fat little kid who was delusional that I would make a skill of it.  \n\nMy grandmother actually stepped in and my father got a divorce over it.  Not the bike itself but the fact that she was to altruistic to others at the detriment of our family.", "Against the grain but ESH\n\nYour dad keeps doing the same thing over and over (by your comments in replies) and you expect him to change.\n\nI think you may need to go as low contact with him as possible & change your relationship with him as he hasn't changed your entire childhood.", "Definitely NTA.

Looks like your dad needs to grow a backbone and stop saying yes to everything", "NTA. Your dad isn't accidentally telling his sister, he's doing this in purpose to take advantage of you.

Why would your dad make a young adult pay for dinner for 12?", "NTA\n\nI suppose it's your Dad's prerogative to give his sister his money or his food.  He doesn't have the right to give your money/food away to anyone.  I think you need to really put your foot down about your Aunt with your Dad.  Especially if you've had several conversations about your Aunt with him.  He knew what he was doing when he invited them along, he probably figured you'd suck it up and pay for the Aunt and family.  He doesn't sound dense enough to not realize the invite didn't extend to extended family, that or she weaseled her way in.\n\nYour Aunt really sucks though.  That has to feel really shitty when a family member takes advantage of you.

It sounds like anything less will be trampled over.\n\nYour Aunt sounds like a leech that you want out of your life unless she can behave like a normal human being, and your father is actively trying to let her suck you dry too. If he can\u2019t respect your boundaries, as soon as you find out he\u2019s crossed them, briefly explain what he did wrong and then leave immediately. Don\u2019t hang around, don\u2019t argue. \u201cYou invited her when I explicitly said it was just for you and me.

Make it clear that she\u2019s on her own and you are not her bank account. If she wants a relationship with you, it will only be because she wants to spend time with you. If she asks you for help with anything, leave. Her entitlement has lost her the benefit of the doubt. Don\u2019t let her in your home, and don\u2019t go anywhere with her. Meet up at the destination, so you both have independent ways to get home. She may try to manipulate you, like \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t kick me out of your home, would you?\u201d Or \u201cyou were my ride, so I don\u2019t have a way home\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m your ride home, so the least you can do is\u2026\u201d\n\nYou may need to do the same thing with your father as well, seeing as they\u2019re apparently attached at the hip.\n\nIt will seem like overkill, but the softer approach hasn\u2019t worked.

It\u2019s also not fair to your sister that she has to suffer for your father\u2019s actions, so tell her to send a photo of her receipt to you and you\u2019ll pay her back, because this dinner was always meant to be about her.
