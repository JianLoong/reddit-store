One time me and my dad were planning on going to the drive in, and my dad stupidly told her. She asked if her kids could be incluided too. I felt pissed because this happened every time me and my dad had something fun planned just me and him. I\u2019m hoping that you get the idea with what I\u2019ve given you so far.\n\nBut anyway\u2026\n\nLast week I wanted to celebrate my little sister from getting her drivers permit and I invited all of our family to Olive Garden (by that I mean all of us who live in the same home). I told everyone to clear their schedules for Friday afternoon because I didn\u2019t want anyone to feel left out. Well, that\u2019s where I messed up, because my dad told my aunt and told her she could tag along WITHOUT TELLING ME!!!\n\nWe showed up to Olive Garden at around 4:30pm and I asked to a table for 5 (Me, My dad, my two sisters and my grandpa) but my dad said that if they could make it a table for 12, I asked why and that\u2019s when he told me. I was pissed, especially because my aunt and my little sister have history but I didn\u2019t think much of it because I wasn\u2019t expecting what was coming up.\n\nWe\u2019re seated and around 30 minutes later she shows up with all her kids. We eventually order and she kept ordering expensive dishes and lots of drinks. I was kind of in awe\u2026 considering she lives off of food stamps (which I don\u2019t shame anyone who does) but she kept ordering like she was Scrooge mcduck on just another Tuesday. The bill eventually comes up and I ask for it to be split. She says in such a grating voice\n \u201cwhat do you mean split bill???! I thought you were paying for us?\u201d\nThat\u2019s when it clicked\u2026 she only came for the free fuc**ng food. \nI immediately glared at my dad, who started blaming me saying \u201c why would you offer to pay? and then not follow through?\u201d \nMaybe because I wasn\u2019t expecting to pay for another 6 people??!?. \n\n\nI ended up asking the waitress how much it would be because I didn\u2019t  want to ruin the mood and my little sister\u2019s accomplishment. \n\nThe bill came out to be about $557.87\u2026\n\nExcluding what me and my family (My dad, my two sisters and my grandpa) ate, it would be about $243.68.\n\nI outright refused to pay for her and her kids\u2019 meals I felt as because two of them are still kids but I never invited her myself, let alone agreed to pay for her bill. \n\nNow my dad is calling me an asshole because he had to pay for it with his credit card. \nI don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong but that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here. \n\nAITA?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nEdit 1: I know I will definitely sound just like any other user saying \u201cI was not expecting this to blow up\u201d but I truly mean it. Also, sorry for all of the grammar and spelling mistakes if there is any, English doesn\u2019t happen to be my first language.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank all of you who gave me truly helpful advice and even gave me some words of encouragement. There is quite a few comments but I\u2019ll make sure to go over each and every one of them. \n\nThere seems to be some confusion so I will clarify here, although if y\u2019all need context on something else let me know in the comments.. \n\nI am 18 years old. I currently don\u2019t attend college because I\u2019m trying to save up and just taking a gap year. \n\nMy dad and my aunt have always been close, they were both addicts together, and they both made my mom\u2019s life a living nightmare, some of you suggested that there may be a \u201csweet home alabama\u201d type thing going on between them and I will tell you now that it is nothing if the sort.\n\nI may said a few very specific things about my aunt like how she has a grating voice, but most of my hatred towards her comes from how my mom would tell me stories on how my aunt and my dad would literally bully my mom and how one time they left her homeless with me and my two sister being >3 years old, my little sister being just a few months old.\n\nSome of you also said that I was seeking validation to a \u201cvery obvious\u201d dilemma, but everyone around me has turned it on me, even my grandpa thinks I was wrong for not paying. Some of my friends are even saying I humiliated them because I should\u2019ve been clear from the start, that\u2019s why I decided to ask Reddit. ( note that I\u2019m not mad about being told how \u201cobvious\u201d this may seem, it\u2019s just that some people don\u2019t know the full extent of the circumstances)\n\nI\u2019m already looking for an apartment I can rent out for me and my sisters, I hate that it\u2019s come to this, but I am done with my dad\u2019s shenanigans.\n\nI\u2019ll try to update if anything else happens, but for now, this is goodbye.\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1697787840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17c5nce/aita_for_not_paying_a_300_bill_for_people_i_didnt/", "score": 7038, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Paying for 5 people you invited and paying for an extra 6 someone else invited, are 2 very different scenarios. \n\nYour dad is way out of line expecting this to be on your dime. \n\nNTA - and you need to caveat future invitations by stating the guest list is closed and if dad protests, he can be off the list too until he learns his lesson. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're aunt is obviously an asshole, but so is your dad! The fact that he's done the same thing multiple times shows a complete lack of care.", "1) Your dad invited her without consulting you.

He is responsible for her and either she pays, or he pays. \n\n2) If he is mad having to pay, then he clearly knows the situation is unfair and has no right to expect you to pay. \n\n3) Since this clearly a whole pathology with your dad and his sister, anytime there are plans, even if she isn\u2019t invited (yet), you need to get in the habit of explicitly saying \u201conly X, Y, and Z are invited not Aunt\u201d and/or \u201cI will not (or will) be covering the cost for Aunt.\u201d Don\u2019t wait for the bill or the resentment that bonding time has been crashed\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA\n\nYour Dad invited them behind your back, it is only right he pays for them.\n\nThe AH here is your Dad and your Aunt.\n\nYou did the right thing, perhaps your Dad will learn to keep his mouth shut.", "NTA.

Stop inviting your dad if it includes his sister and her kids.", "Inviting other people at the outing you had planned without even asking is already not cool, to put it mildy. Inviting someone your little sister doesn't like at the outing you had planned to celebrate her accomplishment is AH behavior. Expecting you to pay for 7 people you haven't invited there after springing it on you at the last minute is outrageous. NTA at all and good for you, for standing your ground.

If he invited them, he should have paid for them.", "Wow reading this made my blood boil. Your Dad is a massive asshole who has major boundary issues. And I would encourage you to put your foot down with him each time he pulls something like this, since HE is the one one with the big mouth inviting her without checking why you first. He\u2019s the one giving your entitled, freeloading aunt the idea that it\u2019s okay for her to crash your family events while everybody else pays her way. I would also explicitly make it clear to your aunt that she is NOT invited to your events. If she shows up, kick her out. Ignore her manipulation and tantrums. Do not give in. Any other family members besides your Dad giving you blowback can host her and pay for her themselves. You are NTA by any stretch of the imagination!", "NTA.

He should have been prepared to pay for her!", "Wow.\n\nNTA.\n\nYour Dad invited her, enables her, and if he's going to to that he has to pay for her. Make absolutely clear that this is the way it is going to be, so any time he pulls this crap again, he's aware that he is on the hook for it.\n\nTerrible that your Dad wasn't paying for his own daughter's celebration anyway. And the fact he used your social embarrassment to try to get you to go along with everything - from not telling you he invited her until it's in front of everybody, to trying to shame you when you say you won't pay. Just awful.", "NTA - I'd stop inviting or including your Dad. Doesn't sound like he adds much besides stress and frustration.", "OP, NTA. AND you ended up with the PERFECT outcome.\n\nThe real culprit and Ahole in all of this is the person who had to pay the bill - your dad. DO NOT REIMBURSE HIM.\n\nYour dad actually initiates telling his sister. He sees an opportunity for her to freeload off of you (or others) and lets her know. He enables your aunt to be the obnoxious freeloader that she is.\n\nIt's not your job to tiptoe around your dad, so make a clear and open announcement to your grandpa, your dad, your two sisters, your aunt, and all the adult cousins: If you plan an event and haven't specifically invited someone, then they are not invited. If your dad chooses to invite additional people, then who pays their share of the bill is between those people and your dad. If they find that rude, tell them it is even ruder to (1) come uninvited by the host, (2) to come uninvited by the host AND expect free anything, (3) to not be the host and invite others to crash an event, and (4) to not be the host and invite others to crash the event AND expect the host to provide for the even-crashers.\n\nAll that goes for dinners out, for dinners in, for parties you host, for going to movies and other entertainment. It even goes for things that don't cost - don't come if the host didn't invite you.\n\nYour aunt is a mooch, but your dad is guy who opens the back door for her and invites her in.\n\nP.S. You don't say how your cousins are. If they show that they are not like their mom (or - like your dad - inclined to open the back door for their mom), then I hope you can build your own relationships with them.", "Easiest NTA. Your dad is an enabler and if he wants to support his sister with his money he can, but you don\u2019t have to. Good job on celebrating your sister!", "NTA. Your dad invited her, so it should be on him.", "This is insane. This is entirely your father's fault, it's exactly right that he should be the one to pay for them.", "Nta. Nobody likes gatecrashers. Since your dad invited your aunt and her 5 kids without telling you, he should pay her share", "NTA your dad invited his sister. He should pay for her. He was definitely TA for inviting 6 additional people and expecting you to pay. Let\u2019s hope he learned his lesson.", "NTA. Your dad invited her then it\u2019s his responsibility to pay for her if she doesn\u2019t. Who invites people on someone else\u2019s dime?", "NTA\n\nYour Dad invited your aunt so it's his responsibility to pay for her", "NTA. Guess dad decided to pull a fast one and shot himself in the foot. If he wants to treat his mooch of a sister he can, but he can't expect you to pay for it.", "NTA, and frankly, I\u2019d tell your dad AND her that the next time she shows up, they need to figure out how her and her kids are being paid for because it\u2019s not on your dime.", "NTA\n\nYour dad decided it was such a great idea to invite a freeloader to eat without telling you until it was the last minute, even though you were the one paying and he knows you and your sister don't get along with her, he's an AH for inviting her on special trips and outings that are meant just for your family.\nYou said you don't like this aunt, why don't you jusy go LC with her? You need to put your foot down, tell your dad you don't want him to invite her again on anything planned for your family, and that if kept doing that, then you will no longer feel obligated to attend or pay, tell him that seeing her on holiday gatherings is more than enough, and if he wants to be around her more, then he should just plan things for the two of them and her kids and pay for it himself, I doubt he would if she always keep ordering more and more expensive food when others are paying.\nIt's unfortunate that she's not in a good financial situation, but that doesn't mean she can take advantage of people around her, you're not obligated to buy her anything, no one is, maybe she should have thought of that before having so many children and then expecting people to pay for her expenses.", ">Now my dad is calling me an asshole because he had to pay for it with his credit card.\n\nHE invited her. HE did that. That is his fault. In fact all of this bs that keeps happening is because of him. I read your comments. Cut!him!off! He was paying for her to do stuff when you all didn't have food. Did you post this just to show to him? Because NTA. He is definitely TA!!!", "NTA.  And in a way, this is a good thing - you were able to put your food down and now your father knows that if he invites her unilaterally, that is on him.  This actually makes things much easier for you to just mention it (her or your father paying for herself) next time she joins, or for having him rethink inviting her to begin with. And mention it early and repeatedly. \n\nYour dad is a piece of work.  Your invitation was clearly for the people YOU invited.  Naturally it did not include people you did not invite, much less people you did not even know were coming.  Your father fucked around and found out.  And I doubt he will forget it given that it cost him $300.  He has to put his money where his mouth is, and I am sure it stung. He deserves it.\n\nBy the way, is your grandfather father to both your father and your aunt? What does he think of this situation?", "Nope right response also tell her to her face in front of Dad you think she is a freeloader, that never pays for anything and let him deal with it.  He wants to create this conflict let it boil over on his lap.  Secondly next sister accomplishment don\u2019t invite mom and dad just take her out yourself.  When asked why just say I don\u2019t think you understand boundaries so I\u2019m celebrating with just us.", "NTA - I would\u2019ve just walked out before dinner when they showed up.

You didn't invite them he clearly did.\n\nI had a step mom with your dad's same problem.  She tried to give away my BMX trick bike.  I bought with money I earned from cutting lawns and delivering papers all summer.  \n\nHer justification was that I was a fat little kid who was delusional that I would make a skill of it.  \n\nMy grandmother actually stepped in and my father got a divorce over it.

She may try to manipulate you, like \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t kick me out of your home, would you?\u201d Or \u201cyou were my ride, so I don\u2019t have a way home\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m your ride home, so the least you can do is\u2026\u201d\n\nYou may need to do the same thing with your father as well, seeing as they\u2019re apparently attached at the hip.\n\nIt will seem like overkill, but the softer approach hasn\u2019t worked.

Sincerely tell them to have a lovely dinner, but that since it\u2019s not fair to kick someone else out of a dinner they believe they were invited to, but that it\u2019s also not fair for you to be manipulated like this (inviting someone to a meal that someone else is paying for, without telling that person that more people will be coming, is akin to saying \u201cI\u2019m entitled to your money\u201d) or for your sister to be manipulated like this (there\u2019s a significant difference between not inviting someone, and specifically telling them they\u2019re not allowed to come, especially when they\u2019ve only just arrived), and because of that you\u2019ll not be joining them. It\u2019s also not fair to your sister that she has to suffer for your father\u2019s actions, so tell her to send a photo of her receipt to you and you\u2019ll pay her back, because this dinner was always meant to be about her. Then leave.

Although, to be fair, he shouldn\u2019t have to since \u201cdad\u201d invited them and should understand it\u2019s an AH move to add SIX (or any) mouths to dinner.  It was a kind event OP did for his sister and his dad ruined it.  Shame on him and his sister (the aunt).  Just because he tolerates her behavior doesn\u2019t mean anyone else needs to\u2026", "Exactly!", "Yeah but aunt wouldn\u2019t even be there and wouldn\u2019t even be a problem without the dad", "Especially an 18 year old. Op is NTA", "Especially at 18", "I wasn't faulting him for anything. Just pointing out how that would have been the ideal way to handle a situation like that. I said multiple times that they were NTA there.", "What are you even talking about? I'm not arguing anything. All I said is how it could have been avoided. OP is here asking if he's an asshole. I said no, but here's how this could have been avoided. I'm not arguing anything, or saying OP is in any way at fault.", "I understand that. But OP offered to pay for everyone at the dinner. People she invited showed up and she made no effort to say that the offer to pay for everyone didn't include them until after the bill came.\n\nIt's really not that hard to communicate these things up front.", "I think the Dad has a habit of extending invitations towards his sister without regard for the situation or the plan.", "Might be why the person you\u2019re replying to said \u201cfor a bit.\u201d", "It was for a **learner's permit**, something most families don't celebrate with the nuclear family, let alone grandparents, aunts and cousins.", "That's when I would bow out.  Sorry dad, it sounds like you don't prioritize me.  Have fun.", "Of course OP shouldn't HAVE to do this.  But if Dad was a decent human being, we wouldn't be hearing about it here.", "The olive garden near me has $25+ entrees and alcohol starts at 15 bucks.", "Exactly.  You didn't ask to be born.  It was his responsibility to take care of you, not the other way around.  Just because someone is family doesn't mean you have to be around them.  Just because someone donated sperm doesn't mean you owe them anything.", "I see a \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d coming OP\u2019s way and I HATE THAT PHRASE!", "The second sentence is calling OP being wrong that he didn't directly tell them. Like I said that makes as much sense as telling someone \"It was wrong you forgot, you should have remembered.\" But well, you don't seem to get that, who cares.", "OP offered to pay for those *they* invited. Period. If their dad wanted to invite anyone else, they should have communicated with OP - not the other way around.", "Even better:  \n\"Can we make that a table for 12?\" - \"No, A table for four, please. \\[to dad\\] You're uninvited, please leave.\"", "At 18 my dad wouldn\u2019t have let me pay for the original 6", "Dad is being weaselly so refuses to see that, so OP can't leave anything open to interpretation. \n\n\"I'm paying for tonight's meal for the 5 people I'm inviting. Feel free to invite anyone else, but that is one them or you.\" Then list the people so it's harder for him to think that it's open tab night.\n\nThen when they got their and dad said table for 12, \"Remember I said I'm only paying for these 5 people. You and they will have to work out the bill yourselves.\"", "He cannot invite a single person if he is a guest.  I have a brother who does the exact same thing--invite people to the parties hosted by other family members.  He needs to have his own parties and invite whomever he likes.", "Dad expects his 18 year old son to pay for an extra 6 people. That's the part that gets me. I'm in my 30's and I would be pissed if someone pulled this stunt even though I have the resources to afford it happening. But to expect an 18 year old to pay for 6 extra people for dinner? That's wild.", "That's the way to handle this. Then OP could choose whether to soften his stance toward his freeloading aunt and her kids. \n\nAs much as I would feel for them, I think the dad should have kept his mouth shut and bought groceries for his sister. \n\nNo one owes them dinner at a restaurant on someone else's tab.  If he wants to give them a restaurant experience, he should do it at his own expense.", "He hasn't learned. He's been doing this for years.", "Or, hear me out, the father and sister were addicts together. If you think the war buddy bond is strong, times that by two and you've the sibling addict bond. \n\nThey scrounged for drugs together, stole and manipulated everyone around them, including his his wife to get drugs. They went so far as to make his wife and small children homeless over drugs. They probably did illegal or embarrassing things to get drugs. \n\nThey are practically trauma bonded together for life. Father has to put her first because she sacrificed to keep him high/from painful withdrawals, and likely he did the same for her. They feel the same guilt and shame over the depravity their addiction took them too. They shared the process of getting clean, (no matter whether they got clean at the same time or not).\n\nThe wife and son will never experience the kind of bond the father has with his sister. He still has the mentality of an addict, where he's entitled to his son's generosity and feels totally embolden to leverage his 18-year-old son, who he should be protecting, into spending his hard earned money on a woman who will out spend everyone else at the table with no shame whatsoever. Why be embarrassed about taking advantage of the OP when his own father practically serves him up to her?\n\nOP is NTA. He needs to get out and take his siblings with him if he can.", "I must have missed where it said 18 yo kid makes more than dad.  Could you point it out for me please.", "$557 bill, and 11 people means an avg ticket price of **$51?!?!** For Olive Garden?", "It obviously wasn't clear. OP acknowledged that it wasn't clear and they made no effort to clarify.\n\nThis really isn't that difficult.", "I've said it before and I'll say it again. People are generally very generous with someone else's generosity. Funny how dad was so put out with paying for people he invited but expected OP to be fine with it.", "100%\n\nI'm really surprised the dad was blaming OP for this. That's peak lack of awareness and indicates he's very much an enabler for his mooch of a sister.", "Depends on the person and the relationship, if I'm hosting someone I don't want them to feel like they can't order what they want because they are worried about the cost.\n\nI picked the restaurant, invited them out and offered to pay, I know what the items cost you don't need to find the cheapest entre and have water.", "Right.  It isn\u2019t difficult at all.  OP\u2019s father invited his aunt.  Thus, OP\u2019s father has to pay for the guests he invited.", "Right?  When it was OP's money, it was \"only $300\".  When it was Dad's money it was \"OMG, THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS!!! DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO PAY ALL OF THAT??!! Did everybody hear that?? I'm expected to pay ***THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS*** right here and now????!!!!!\"", "Since you bring up family -- that's what I'm suspicious of.\n\nI wonder if OP's dad is helping support his sister and is trying to get OP used to being expected to do the same.", "This is proper etiquette for the situation. I had an aunt take me to dinner back in high school, and I didn't think anything of what I had ordered, but she latee explained this, and I hadn't done it since.", "How did she eat about 48 oysters and a main dish without getting sick?", "Remember dads been including her in drive in movies since OP was a child. Dad created this monster.", "\nThis is an 18 yo (I think that\u2019s right) not an established adult with good income.  Still wasn\u2019t dad\u2019s place to invite 6 other ppl", "I don't know what privileged neck of the woods you live in, but even if I wanted to pay for extra people, family or not, an extra $50-300 for a meal at a restaurant could range from difficult to impossible for me. I'm sure OP's budget factored into the choice of Olive Garden at least somewhat. \n\nOP is generous, no matter what amount they planned to spend on this celebration or how they decided on that amount.\n\nAunt, and Dad, are counting on OP not standing up to \"B-b-but, fAmiLeEEEeee^(eeee)!\"\n\nWeaponized awkwardness, if you will. *And it's not OK.*\n\nBravo/Brava to OP for standing up to it and for showing their younger siblings, by example, that they shouldn't put up with this treatment.", "It can be different cultures. If I took someone out to dinner to celebrate something, any tight budgeting I'm doing will come from my end. They are there to celebrate, so a nice steak/seafood and a handful of drinks is my expectation of them.\n\nBut really, I just want them to have a great time. Unless they try ordering 3 entrees, I'll be happy to foot the bill.\n\nThis is how I was raised also; when you're a \"guest of honor\" essentially, even in a small party, you shouldn't feel guilty for ordering something nice. Just keep it within like, the same order of magnitude as everyone else.", "RIGHT?! Plus 3 fancy cocktails!! Best I could do is maybe 2 cocktails and the main dish. Maybe an app if I didn't eat all of the main dish and got a doggy bag.", "I hope she did get sick, that was NASTY.", "the paint on the walls in her bathroom had to peel once she processed all that."]}
