{"id": 6654, "submission_id": "1051oje", "title": "AITA for causing my mother to be homeless?", "selftext": "My (M25) single mother (49) and I had a falling out in 2021. Long story short, she was physically and mentally abusive throughout my childhood. She beat me, groomed me into conspiracy theories (mostly involving aliens, reptilian shapeshifters, spirits, astrology, crystals, etc), treated my physical/mental health almost exclusively with herbs and Eastern medicine practices without any medical training or education. I believed a lot of this to be normal until I grew up and started questioning her. I then started noticing how much she lied, her EXTREME impulsiveness, how much she valued her public image (but would be completely different in private), and her gaslighting friends/colleagues/children, including me. It became more apparent when I started dating my now wife. My wife also works in the mental health field, and she would subtly hint at unhealthy behaviors she noticed in my mother that I otherwise thought was completely normal.\u00a0\n\nIn 2021, my mother decided she wanted to move all her belongings into a storage unit and buy a van to build into a mini-camper. It's called Van Life. I helped her build the van. She kept making modifications to the construction and making impulsive last-minute purchases that she couldn't afford for me to install in the van. It was overwhelming, and I felt all my past and present resentment really overtake me. I couldn't stand being around my mother anymore. She was with me while I was working on the van, and I decided to confront her. I called her out on everything. There was always an excuse, or she claimed she didn't remember or know what I was talking about. We had a heated argument for maybe 2 hours. We decided to stop and cool off. I gave her a hug and told her I loved her.\u00a0\n\nA few hours later, both my brother and sister called me angry and confused. After talking to them, apparently my mother told them I called her a terrible mother, said that I was throwing things into her van to cause damage, along with several other false claims. None of this was true or even happened. I wasn't even mad at first, I was just in complete shock that my mom would go this far. I called my mom and asked her why she lied to my siblings. She then proceeded to tell me that none of it was a lie and that all happened in her eyes. This crossed my boundary. I told her that if she didn't tell the truth that she needed to get her van out of my garage and find someone else to work on it. My mother wouldn't budge. I told her she has 1 day to get it off my property, and then hung up the phone.\u00a0\n\nThe van was not completed, she had no one to work on it, and her rental house lease was finished in 4 weeks. There was no agreement that she was to stay in my house until it was finished, which I have since heard she is claiming she was supposed to live with me. She had to couch surf with friends and stay in hotels until she finally got a new rental house 4 or 5 months later.\n\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1673030082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1051oje/aita_for_causing_my_mother_to_be_homeless/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Based in my own experience, any relationship with her is best kept, not at arms length, but at ten-foot-pole-length.\nShe will continue lying to whomever will listen what a terrible son you are, and about all sorts of terrible things you are supposed to have inflicted upon her.\nShe will damage your reputation, your relationship with other members of your family, and find ways to damage you mentally, emotionally, and financially, and then deny it ever happened. \n\nThere is no fixing a person like this, and keeping her in your life beyond a courtesy call on birthdays and holidays will leave you with non-stop job of damage control, and  mental exhaustion. \n\nIt's not worth it.", "NTA, live a wonderful life without her.", "NTA you should cut your toxic mother out of your life completely", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou've suffered enough.
