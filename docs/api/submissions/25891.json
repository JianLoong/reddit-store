{"id": 25891, "submission_id": "165qzbd", "title": "AITA because I told my boyfriend's ex I didn't give a crap about their kids?", "selftext": "I have been friends with Tim for a few years, and he separated from his wife Amy 6 months ago. Once he moved into his new place, we began dating. Amy thinks there was overlap, but there wasn't. Also, what Amy thinks means nothing to me. Tim separated from Amy because an incident finally took place that she should have been arrested for, and he could have gotten a restraining order for. It's her own fault they separated, and it was a despicable thing she did, it had zero to do with me.   \n\n\nAmy has been erratic for their entire relationship. I have always known this and witnessed it a number of times for the past few years I have known them. She has been in and out of psychiatric treatment and nothing has helped much. When Amy had their first child, she actually stabilized mentally for a while. She really wanted a second child and thought it would help so Tim agreed. But after the second child she actually got a lot worse, and again, medication didn't help her. She did get help again but it didn't seem to work.   \n\n\nIt's clear Amy really loves her children and she has never done anything to harm them, as far as I know. She mainly releases her extreme rage towards Tim, plus whoever else sticks up for him or is in the vicinity when she goes off. Even though Amy is erratic, I believe she is in full control over her actions and behaviors. She chooses when to go off and when to present a different image to the world. She'll say that she only goes off \"when people piss her off\" so she herself is admitting it's her entitlement to dictate what everyone around her should do and how they should cater to her.   \n\n\nLike I said Amy loves her children, and she is extremely obsessed with them. She thinks they are unique, special children unlike the world has ever seen. All parents think this of their kids, but Amy thinks it to the point of extreme delusion. She is one of those moms that will bully other children on the playground so her kids can always get their way. Her favorite threat to others is \"you'll never be allowed to see my kids again.\" It's one thing to say this to someone who gives a shit, like grandparents, but she'll threaten neighbors and others with that too.  \n\n\nSince I started dating Tim, Amy is obsessed with the idea that I want to be the \"new mommy.\" She has \"told me off\" on many different formats about how I will NEVER be her kids's new mommy and how I'm \"delusional trash\" if I think I can be a mommy etc.   \n\n\nUsually I laugh this off, I don't even like kids, and their kids are exceptionally unpleasant to be around. They're bullies, entitled, and think the world revolves around them. I don't blame them for this because it's not their fault and they're still very young. I'm trying to appreciate them but have zero desire to be their mommy.    \n\n\nOne time Amy caught me on the wrong day and I said, \"Amy get over it, I don't give a crap about your kids.\" It's not even true, I do care about the kids even though I don't want to be their mommy.

Prepare for a more volatile life if you proceed further with this family whether you\u2019re inserting yourself or not.", "I would just get out of this relationship.", "YTA They aren\u2019t just her kids, they are also Tim\u2019s kids. They will always be in his life and assuming he is a decent dad, they are far more important to him than you are. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be around his kids then end the relationship rather than putting the kids through that kids of neglect or abuse from a terrible step-parent.", "YTA for dating someone with an ex and kids and then complaining about the ex and kids. Amy may be unhinged but you can easily walk away from this.", "Yta for dating someone with kids when u feel this way about kids and his kids. Why are u dating a father when you know he comes with kids?? I mean she clearly sucks but ur kind of putting urself in a shitty situation that's just gonna end bad cause u don't like kids", "ESH. \n\nI get that you are angry and annoyed and she sounds like an absolute nightmare. But you are dating a dad who very recently separated from this person who you know to be an absolute nightmare, and its a difficult, volatile situation but here is the thing: It's really really not about you. Tim's full attention right now should be on trying to end this relationship with Amy as cleanly and as peacefully as humanly possible so that their bad choices stop destroying their kids' lives and to see their schedules and expectations to become calm and ordered and predictable as quickly as possible. \n\nAnd if you don't want to be a mom, don't date a man with two young kids. Seriously. It's so not fair for the kids. Because even if they live with the mom 90% of the time (and given what you said they shouldn't and Tim should take way more responsibility) - you will have a role in their lives and it better be a good one. And it better not be influencing Tim to spend more time with you and less time with his very young kids who need a stable father.", "If you don\u2019t like kids and his are \u201cexceptionally unpleasant\u201d, YTA. You should not be dating him then. Nothing serious can come between the two of you if you don\u2019t care about the kids. Which you totally contradicted yourself in here, first saying you have zero desire to be their mommy then backtracking saying you care. But make no mistake, if you want this to be serious, you WILL be their stepmom at some point.", "YTA. \n\nWtf are you dating someone with children? \n\nFrankly, if your boyfriend continues dating you, he\u2019s just as much of an AH for being with someone that doesn\u2019t even like his children.", "ESH-  Amy is bizarre.  Tim isn't taking charge.  And, you need to accept that Tim will not live two lives because his kids and recently separated (not even divorced?) wife will always be present.", "YTA. The children you are talking about are Tim's kids, and if you are planning to be with Tim, you should be helping him create a good parenting relationship. Instead, it sounds like you are making an already tense and volatile situation worse by coming into it full of venom towards the ex wife and kids.", "YTA and so is Tim. Neither of you are even up for the task of being good guardians to his children. Everything else is irrelevant. And boy oh boy I\u2019d love to know the nature of your friendship with Tim before his separation from Amy.", "YTA the best solution is to just let the kids stay with Amy 100% of the time. That way you dont have to deal with amy being erratic, or her unpleasant kids.", "ESH she sounds like she needs a lot of help, but you should never date a parent if you don't like kids, and as their father, he needs to put his kids before romance.", "YTA.  You are wayyyyy too immature to be trusted around anyone\u2019s children and if Tim isn\u2019t careful, he could lose visitation/custody because of your psychosis.  If you don\u2019t like kids, why are you dating a guy that has them?  You just like the Amy drama and Tim will tire of it and you\u2026don\u2019t unpack your bags sweetie.", "YTA - So is Tim.

She's unstable and is going to make your life miserable and you think the kids are exceptionally unpleasant, bullies and entitled- which means you're eventually going to make their lives miserable.\n\nLet this guy sort out his custody, build better boundaries with his ex and get his kids into counseling.", "YTA\n\nIf you don't like kids and find Tim's \"exceptionally unpleasant to be around.\", why are you dating their father?\n\nAlso, if the kids are bullies and entitled, that's on their parents - Tim and his ex.\n\nBut I think the real problem here is Tim: he really needs to find a nice woman to date or marry. And it's not your nor his ex (although it is sweet that you think that you are better than his ex just because your are mentally stable)", "NTA. Fuck them kids \ud83d\ude02", "NTA for the circumstances, but I think you need to rethink your relationship. There's really no point in continuing to invest in your relationship with Tim if you don't want to become a parental figure to his kids. When you date a parent, their children will always be part of the package (so long as they're not a deadbeat).", "Ehhh... NTA. If you are planning to be with the guy long term, you are signing up for his ex and kids in your life. I hope he is worth it.", "NTA I understand that you care about the kids but you tell her that you don\u2019t because she\u2019s fucking delusional and thinks you want to be their mom.", "Not a very popular opinion but NTA. It had to be said.", "NTA. You don\u2019t hate the kids. You\u2019re just brutal about them. I really don\u2019t see the issue so long as you aren\u2019t mean to them.

There's no hatred - just no desire to raise or have  a life with dependent children. Totally ok. \n\nBut absolutely NOT ok if you intend to have a serious relationship with a parent. As a parent's SO, you will be involved in these children's lives no matter how that plays out. Your lack of desire to be so will have negative effects on them as they grow and develop. It doesn't make you a bad person to not want that. It makes you selfish and irresponsible to continue your relationship with Tim knowing how a child free perspective will harm the children- intentional or not. \n\nI'll reiterate that I don't think you're an asshole for having a child free life.
