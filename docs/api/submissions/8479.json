However, this year he didn't even do that, which upset me, but it is what it is.  I can't force him to put forth an effort.\n\nFor his birthday, I usually make his favorite dinner, make his favorite cake, and get him something small along with a few bottles of various whiskey for him to try.  This year I even made him a card and put our dogs pawprints inside for him.\n\nWe both work 50-65 hours a week.  He owns his own business and I'm an office manager/accountant at my day job and do his bookkeeping on the weekends.\n\nMy friends/family asked me what he go me this year and I was honest, and said nothing.  This has hands down been one of the worst birthdays I've had and I didn't want to lie to my friends and family.  They could tell I was upset and hurt by the situation.  My husband told me \"happy birthday\" before he left for work, so he didn't forget, but that was the end of it.\n\nWell, one of my friends, who is also his friend, called him out on it and he was pissed that I told her that he didn't get me anything.  I asked him what he expected me to say and he replied with I should tell them a fib because it was embarrassing for him that our mutual friend knew he didn't put any effort into my birthday.\n\nSo, my question is, am I the asshole for refusing to tell our friends and family a lie when they ask what he got me for my birthday?  I'm not going out of my way to tell them the truth, but if they ask, I feel I should be able to be honest.  If he wanted to be seen in a better light, he should have put some effort in my birthday.

I'm always here for communication, which is often the root of AITA posts' problems. If your birthday passed without you commenting on the lack of celebration, maybe he really thought you didn't care. You should talk to him about it. And if he still doesn't care, knowing that it bothered you, then tbh I'd stop putting in the effort for his.
