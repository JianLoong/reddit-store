However, this year he didn't even do that, which upset me, but it is what it is.  I can't force him to put forth an effort.\n\nFor his birthday, I usually make his favorite dinner, make his favorite cake, and get him something small along with a few bottles of various whiskey for him to try.  This year I even made him a card and put our dogs pawprints inside for him.\n\nWe both work 50-65 hours a week.  He owns his own business and I'm an office manager/accountant at my day job and do his bookkeeping on the weekends.\n\nMy friends/family asked me what he go me this year and I was honest, and said nothing.  This has hands down been one of the worst birthdays I've had and I didn't want to lie to my friends and family.  They could tell I was upset and hurt by the situation.  My husband told me \"happy birthday\" before he left for work, so he didn't forget, but that was the end of it.\n\nWell, one of my friends, who is also his friend, called him out on it and he was pissed that I told her that he didn't get me anything.  I asked him what he expected me to say and he replied with I should tell them a fib because it was embarrassing for him that our mutual friend knew he didn't put any effort into my birthday.\n\nSo, my question is, am I the asshole for refusing to tell our friends and family a lie when they ask what he got me for my birthday?  I'm not going out of my way to tell them the truth, but if they ask, I feel I should be able to be honest.  If he wanted to be seen in a better light, he should have put some effort in my birthday.  Instead, I was left with a pile of dishes to wash while he played his video game.", "created_utc": 1674841916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mr55e/aita_for_being_honest_about_what_my_husband_got/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should you lie because your husband is an uncaring and inconsiderate AH.\n\nHave you told him what you would like him to do for your birthday?  And If probably give as much consideration to his birthday that he gives to yours going forward.", "NTA. Why should you have to cover for his indifference towards your birthday? It says a lot that he isn\u2019t motivated on his own but is motivated/shamed when others call him on it.   \n\nStart buying yourself something extra on your birthday if he\u2019s not going to put in any effort, and not do anything for his birthday going forward. If he asks why you haven\u2019t put in effort, you can tell him you assumed that you just weren\u2019t mutually celebrating each others birthdays any longer if he couldn\u2019t put in the effort.", "NTA. I have been in a similar situation. If he didn't want people to know, he should have done something for you.", "NTA\n\nDon't lie to cover his lack of effort.\n\nThat said, did you tell him you were disappointed by his lack of effort? Some people don't care about or even actively dislike their birthdays, and some people like them or even want to go all out. Everyone's different. I'm always here for communication, which is often the root of AITA posts' problems. If your birthday passed without you commenting on the lack of celebration, maybe he really thought you didn't care. You should talk to him about it. And if he still doesn't care, knowing that it bothered you, then tbh I'd stop putting in the effort for his. Cooking and baking and getting gifts in exchange for absolutely nothing is a bad deal.", "This right here says it all: \n\n>If he wanted to be seen in a better light, he should have put some effort in my birthday.

NTA.", "NTA. And don't do anything for his next birthday. I bet you do most of the housework as well as working for free on the weekends for him. He's treating you like a servant, you don't have to reward him for it.", "NTA.

You didn't even complain or fight with him about doing nothing for your birthday. Someone asked what he got you and you told the truth. If he cared about you he would have put effort into your birthday. If he cared about how he would look to others if he put no effort into your birthday, then he should have put effort into your birthday. You are not the asshole for being honest. He's an asshole that he did nothing for you but leave you a sink full of dishes on your birthday. And he's more of an asshole because he's calling you an asshole and saying you should have lied for him to make him look better. BUT my question to you is why are you putting any effort into his.
