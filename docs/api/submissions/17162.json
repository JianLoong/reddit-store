She and\u00a0I work incredibly well together but don\u2019t talk about family stuff while at work.\n\nLast weekend, the two had a combined baby shower/gender reveal party for their baby. I think that they had planned to have a gender reveal party separately from the baby shower, but things just worked out this way instead.\n\nAnyways, everything seemed fine on the day of the party and everyone was having a good time. At the gender reveal, everyone found out that they were having a girl. They both reacted well at first and it was sweet until later when I saw that Dani was visibly upset... crying, hyperventilating, etc. At one point, four people were\u00a0trying to console her.\u00a0\n\nI ran into her on the way to the bathroom and asked her if she was feeling any better, instant tears. When I asked her what was wrong, she told me that even though she knows it was stupid, she thought she was having a boy and was unsure if she was ready for a girl.\u00a0\n\nI told her as a friend, that she has a lot to be grateful for regardless... that it is completely unreasonable to be so upset about her child\u2019s gender and let her negative feelings\u00a0overshadow the fact that she and her baby are completely healthy and have a support system that other women would be happy to have.\u00a0\n\nBy this point, she was bawling even worse, and I didn\u2019t know what to do (I am not a very touchy-feely person). I went and found Phil and he calmed her down.\u00a0\n\nDani was standoffish at work the following week and not her usual self. Like not outwardly rude but she\u2019s usually a lot nicer.\u00a0I asked her in my office if something was wrong, and she said that I made her feel like sh\\*t at the party and that she was still kind of upset with me.\u00a0\n\nMy gut is telling me that I should apologize, but on the other hand, I feel like she was being ungrateful at the party in many ways (also I'm not even sure she would care). To me, even as someone without kids I know that just the fact Dani has a healthy family so far and the finances to support a child is more than most people have, so literally freaking out because you aren\u2019t having a boy just seems kind of asshole-ish.\u00a0", "created_utc": 1684007655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gr13k/aita_for_telling_my_sisterinlaw_that_she_was/", "score": 803, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But in practice YTA. \n\nShe's 7 months pregnant. She just needed a minute to deal with her feelings, not to be judged for not being able to control her feelings on hormones.", "I think YTA. You straight up dismissed her emotions because you felt like she had nothing to be upset about in your eyes. And you also didn't apologize for making her even more upset.", "You told a crying 7-month pregnant woman she was being unreasonable about her visualizing her child's gender, and then gave her \\*advice\\* about it when she found out it was different from what she visualized,  when clearly what she wanted was \\*sympathy\\*?\n\nYTA.", "YTA she was already extremely upset & then you go and tell her to suck it up and be grateful ? I\u2019ll never understand why people get so defensive when someone gets upset about the gender of their baby. If she wants to cry about it she can I mean look at how the world is towards girls/women of course she wouldn\u2019t want to bring a daughter into a world like this.", "Sorry, YTA.\n\nWhen someone is having intense feelings, telling them reasons why they shouldn't have those feelings doesn't help.\n\nIt also doesn't help to judge whether someone SHOULD be in an emotional crisis over a particular thing. We're all different, and if someone's feelings don't make sense to you, there's probably more to the situation than you know and maybe even more than they know.\n\nI was trained and volunteered at a crisis center many years ago, and the most lasting lesson I got from that was that when someone is in an emotional crisis, then as long as there is no immediate physical danger, what they need is to be truly heard, understood, and empathized with.\n\nOffering solutions (including providing reasons why things will probably be okay) is best when someone's not freaking out.\n\nFor example, if someone just saw their dog get hit by a car, it's not time to point out that they have a good life and they can get another dog. It may not have been clear to you why your friend would be so upset under the circumstances, but her emotions were likely just as intense in that moment as those of someone who just lost their dog.\n\nHere's the best logic to apply in that kind of situation: Logic won't fix feelings.\n\nAs you may see based on your friend's reaction, the logical move if you're ever in a similar situation would be to simply be there for the person, listen, and empathize as best you can.", "Hey, YTA! Big picture, is it silly for her to be upset about the gender of her kid when everyone is healthy? Sure, maybe. But when\u2019s the last time you successfully comforted someone in distress by berating them? \n\nI have an analogy I use to explain this. Imagine you have planned a special weekend treat for your toddler. You got a Mickey Mouse waffle maker, and you\u2019re going to surprise them with amazing disney waffles! But shockingly, when you put down this amazing plate of waffles, they burst into tears! The little one is upset that the waffles are different than they are used to, they want their normal square waffles. \n\nObviously, between you and me, as adults, this distress is ridiculous. The waffles don\u2019t taste different, and the disney waffles are objectively better because they are cool and themed. You have two options for how to handle this with the tot: \n\nA) tell the child that their distress is unwarranted and they are reacting in a very stupid way right now. \u2014> this is will result in either a bigger tantrum or a completely shutdown kid. Either way, no one is eating your damn waffles. \n\nB) validate their distress, help them calm down, and then explain that the waffles don\u2019t taste any different, and that we\u2019re trying something new today. \u2014> the tantrum will be over much more quickly, and the kid will, more likely than not, get excited about the cool Mickey Mouse waffles, because they are, as we have already established, objectively cool.  \n\nMoral of the story: we may get more complex as we age, but nothing fundamentally changes. When we are upset, we don\u2019t think logically, and in order to get back to the place where we can think about the big picture, we need to be seen and comforted, just like a little kid. \n\nThis woman, who is both your friend and your family, was escalated and overwhelmed. Doubts and mixed feelings about the sex of the baby are normal, and she ended up going on that roller coaster in front of lots of people, which I\u2019m sure was not part of how she planned to enjoy this event. \n\nIt is a normal impulse to want to highlight the positives for people in order to reduce their discomfort (and often, our discomfort with their discomfort), but by steamrolling over the reality of how people feel, we often intensify their distress. \n\nFeelings are important information, and I think it\u2019s worthwhile to consider why you have mixed feelings about this. A brief apology would not be out of order. I know you said you\u2019re not a big feelings person, so it doesn\u2019t need to be anything crazy. Something like \u201cHey Dani, I wanted to reach out and apologize for what I said at the shower. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel worse. I\u2019m here for you if you need anything.\u201d", "Soft YTA.\n\nIn a broad way you're right that a healthy child is more important than gender, but you can't logic away emotions, especially with \"it could be worse\" or \"be grateful for what you have\".  She knew it wasn't logical, so saying the reaction was \"completely unreasonable\" is neither helpful nor supportive.  And pregnancy messes with hormones anyway.\n\nPeople who make an *ongoing deal* of wanting the other gender might need a reality check, but not when overwhelmed with initial emotion.  Also this may just have been \"it felt like a boy so I was fantasizing about having a boy and just surprised\", not literally thinking boys are better.\n\nI personally think gender reveal is a silly tradition, and the possibility of an unexpected emotional reaction is one reason. (The reaction would be there regardless but not in front of people.)  But there are better ways to support someone without downplaying emotions they can't actually control.", "Have you ever been so emotional about something that you cried uncontrollably in public? Imagine if someone said essentially, \u201cBuck up and be grateful, other people have it worse.\u201d Those may not be the words, but that\u2019s the gist. \n\nWould that make you feel better? Would you have warm and fuzzy feelings about the person who said it? YTA.", "YTA. You could have comforted her without telling her she is unreasonable and has negative feelings.", "Why do ppl have gender reveal parties if they\u2019re going to have a panic attack when they get the gender they don\u2019t expect? Why don\u2019t people only have them if they don\u2019t care either way?", "YTA - \"...it is completely unreasonable to be so upset about her child\u2019s gender\"...when did you get hired to decide what people can and cannot be upset about? \n\nShe needed your presence, your empathy...her hormones are bonkers. You could have shared, \"I'm sorry you are upset...can I give you a hug? Know what I think? You are gonna be an awesome mom...how about you and I walk outside and then grab another slice of cake.\" -- This is supportive and distracts her from the mental focus that upset her. Having a kid is riddled with many unknowns. You are judging her thinking she has everything on a silver plater but dang...cut her some slack. This life change is both terrifying, disappointing, and amazing at times. Best to you.", "You found her in tears over something she\u2019d just found out and you decided to tell her she was being unreasonable.\n\nYTA\n\nYou\u2019re right that she was being somewhat unreasonable. That doesn\u2019t make it a good idea to SAY it. You could surely have found any number of constructive things to say instead.\n\nAlso, I heartily anti-endorse gender reveal parties for So Many Reasons.", "YTA - you should have just left it alone, you were being insensitive. People are allowed to be upset. It was the day of, it\u2019s not like she was upset for days/weeks. Sometimes hormones are extra sensitive during pregnancy too, which could have started the waterworks.\n\nIf something bad happens in your life, people telling you that you\u2019re ungrateful cause other people have it worse is not helpful in the least.", "YTA\n\nShe didn\u2019t say she was upset or even disappoint about having a girl. She said she felt unprepared. Why not ask her what she means or why she feels that way so you can listen & acknowledge her fears & assure her she is ready to be an awesome mom to a daughter or a son. Instead you really come of as if you admonished her for being scared & worried about being a good mom. You invalidated her feeling. Even if you didn\u2019t mean it that way, that\u2019s what she heard. Apologize, assure her she\u2019ll be a great mom, and if she has any concerns or worries you are hear to listen & support her without judgement - your sister.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think you mean it maliciously or anything but she was clearly worked up over this revel and you kinda added to her stress, on top of her being 7 months pregnant and hormonal AF. You made her feel judged for her feelings, and telling her that she was acting completely unreasonable was definitely not the best think to say here. She was looking for support not judgment. \n\nI think if you apologize and let her know that you didn\u2019t mean it maliciously and let her know that her feelings are valid, you both can move past it", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds Ike she was saying she thought she was having a boy. It\u2019s not unusual when pregnant to feel like the pregnancy is a certain sex. Whether that\u2019s more because of hormones, personal wants, or everyone and their mother\u2019s mother telling you what you are having because of the shape of your stomach/skin condition/hair part/specific craving/color of the sky/how their hand felt when they touched your stomach before asking\u2026who can say.\n\nThe point is that it\u2019s very ways while pregnant to picture your future child and it can be jarring when reality goes against those expectations. It\u2019s healthy to recognize that difference and to try and process it. Crying and letting those emotions run through you is an effective way to do that.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t someone against having a girl. You should apologize.", "NTA\n\nYou're right. But go apologize anyways. Lol", "Going against the grain with a NTA. If this was a guy hyperventilating and freaking out bc he was having a girl, he\u2019d be crucified. She isn\u2019t ready for a girl? What\u2019s that supposed to mean? That we\u2019re that much harder or worse? I feel bad for the daughter, especially if they have another kid and it\u2019s a boy. Sounds like Dani will be one of those \u201cboy moms\u201d", "YTA. She wasn't even saying she was disappointed just that she thought one thing and was feeling emotional about it being different. Pregnancy makes all of your emotions heightened and all over the place and she said she knew it was stupid. It's super common in pregnancy and your comment was just being a jerk. You should absolutely apologize", "YYA - she didn\u2019t need the facts. She needed empathy.", "YTA. You know what makes you feel better when you\u2019re upset? Having someone diminish your feelings, tell you lots of people have it worse, and lecture you. Well done. /s", "I don't like using the term AH, but in this sub it's the term we're stuck with, so with that reluctance, I'm going with YTA.\n\nI can see what you were trying to do. You saw her engulfed in negativity and you sought to counter that with a positive perspective. In truth, all she wanted to do was grapple with her feelings, and for that she just needed a sympathetic and non-judgemental ear. Well meaning as it was, you probably ended up making her feel even more irrational than she'd already acknowledged she was being.\n\nThere's a bridge to be mended. You could perhaps bite the bullet, tell her that you made a bad call, apologise for your insensitivity, and ask her to forgive you. The chances look good, from how you describe her, that this dust will settle.", "YTA. When I was pregnant, I just knew I was having a boy. The thought that my baby was a girl was just immediately dismissed because it felt wrong. She was hormonal, emotional and needed a few minutes to process..", "NTA, but you should apologize.\n\nYou didn't say anything wrong necessarily, but it's obvious that isn't what she wanted to hear at that moment.

Especially when you're pregnant.", "Absolutely YTA - gender disappointment is a very real thing. And her needing time to adjust doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t appreciate having a healthy baby or any of that.", "NTA she's being misogynistic already, gender disappointment is real but to say she's 'not ready' for a girl is a different level", "Yeah, she was unreasonable and what you said was correct.

Then do it.", "YTA you just invalidated her feelings. There may be a reason she is concerned about having a girl (past trauma) or maybe she just had her heart set on a boy and it will take some time to get excited for her baby girl. She can feel however she wants", "NTA...apologize for what?\n\nIf she wasn't ready to accept that she would possibly be having a girl, why the hell did they want a public gender reveal?

Maybe in her family, for instance, there\u2019s a lot of pressure to have a boy first (regardless of how ridiculous that is, I have heard of it). In one of my pregnancies I was basically told by my then-partner and his family that I WAS going to have a girl, and that they were excited for it, so when it turned out to be a boy I felt like \u201coh no I\u2019ve disappointed everyone!\u201d You don\u2019t know why she felt the way she did. You just went straight to judgemental \u201cyou should be grateful you have a baby at all\u201d. YTA and please do better next time.", "YTA for trying to talk logic into a pregnant lady. Leave it to the husband to sort things out as anything you say or do would be held against you. I know you meant well but you can't reason with someone who is acting on emotions.", "She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed if she had a gender preference for her child. You were extremely dismissive. YTA.", "YTA. Her feelings aren\u2019t unreasonable. I wanted (and got) boys. Girls would have terrified me.

You were cruel to her on the behalf of an imaginary audience *because she cried while 7 months pregnant*. And it wasn't out of malice or disappointment.

Not the time or place to call her out for how YOU think she should be reacting.", "You are right but there's a time and place for everything. Just apologize tbh. You weren't wrong but not very... smart. YTA. But also not. But mostly AH", "I think maybe ESH\n\nI want to give grace because she's pregnant and probably has a lot going on with her body and emotions that she can't control, but I do find it actually genuinely worrying for her poor daughter that this was her first reaction to finding out she was having a girl.  So I do think she is being an AH to her unborn child to have such a strong preference.  The baby can't help who they are, and if she wants to be a mom she is going to need to set her internalized misogyny aside so she doesn't pass it down.\n\nHowever, I think that conversation would have been much better had after the party, in private, once she'd had some time to collect herself.  If you're not in a position to help someone in acute distress without berating them, then find someone else who can.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. She\u2019s pregnant and upset and needed a minute. I think for a mother, having a girl is a lot more confronting in some ways, the fear of looking in a mirror per se as they develop and grow into their own individual self. It think it may seem more daunting in a way? The thought of it? I\u2019m not sure really but just thoughts.", "YTA Op! \n\nEveryone is entitled and allowed to feel their feelings. \n\nIf she was unsure about having a daughter and coming to terms, that\u2019s perfectly allowed! \n\nShe had just found out and needed some grace and time to adjust. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdYou should get her some chocolate, apologize and RE-ASSURE her that she will be a great mom to her daughter.

But reason is not what\u2019s making her upset. You had no business telling her to get over herself, it wasn\u2019t your place. I could even understand if you being unable to understand her emotions would just bail, and tell someone else to take over and comfort her and just do a little pat pat there there. \n\nAs a side note I don\u2019t understand why people have gender reveals when they are so set on a specific gender. Why would you put yourself in such a public display of emotions? If you are dead set in a specific gender honestly get the news on your own, and take a couple of days or weeks to digest it on your own with the help of your partner. The last thing you ever want is for it to become a story among the guests to tell your child in the future.

Gender disappointment is an incredibly common thing, just none of us ever get to talk about it because we get judgmental comments like yours and are made to feel bad about having frankly any negative feelings about pregnancy in general. Pregnant persons are constantly pressured to \u201cbe grateful\u201d or \u201cjust be happy,\u201d or my favorite \u201cit could be worse.\u201d Combined with the emotional heightening caused by hormones for the pregnant person and the stress something like even a fun party can bring at this stage in pregnancy it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have a cry.\n\n Gender disappointment is nuanced and complex, it\u2019s not about hating the particular genitals your child happens to have but rather the big change in how you imagined your future to be. Most of us while expecting a child imagine who this little person is going to be, what they\u2019ll be like and how your family will be changed and yes this does typically include the gender. When you learn the baby isn\u2019t the gender you saw in your vision you also now mourn this whole life you imagined. Almost everyone gets over it rather quickly and moves on to form their new idea.

When I found out at 7 months I'd be a girl, I was dissapointed because I planned everything for a boy.

At least in America. If I were expecting, as a woman myself, I would be petrified to have a daughter in this political climate.

How would that make her less upset?\n\nEven with a planned baby and great support bringing a child into the world can be overwhelming.

If Dani had a tough time growing up in some way she might feel more worried about how she could protect a daughter than a son. \n\nAgain, I have no idea why she feels/felt like that. Neither do you though, because you didn't ask, you just jumped straight into telling her she was a bad person for feeling like that. You should apologise at a minimum.

Let's write it off on hormones but that is not a normal reaction....", "totally agree with you! was surprised i had to scroll so far for this response too... a little bit of disappointment i would maybe sympathise with (but again, my pov is if you want a baby you should be ready for every shape & size that baby can come in), but hyperventilating in the middle of her party to the point that four other adults were unable to console her? wtf. that is not a normal reaction at all & i seriously feel for the baby girl. any misbehaviour or ordinary baby problems, like teething or crying, i feel are going to be attributed to girls being more difficult, or whatever weird notion she is under.", "thank you. i was kind of shocked to see so many YTAs. she\u2019s having a healthy baby, and she has a mental breakdown because it\u2019s a girl, not a boy? what will happen when the baby is born? will she carry that disappointment with her still? i get having expectations, but being this upset about your baby not being the gender you expected is kinda ridiculous", "Idk about that.  I was anxious when I found out I was having a boy because I don't know how to interact with boy children very well.  With a girl, I remember what I did when I grew up -- dress up, barbies, princesses...then, after awhile, I remembered I also liked Batman and dinosaurs and I calmed down.  Maybe I'll play pirates instead of princesses.  But I still had to take some time to PROCESS those emotions in order to think rationally.  Of course, I also opted not to have a gender reveal -- I don't like surprises in the first place, let alone public ones.  \n\nHaving a baby is a huge life change and so many parts of it are overwhelming, especially with hormones rampaging.  She's probably also grieving what could have been, what she'd envisioned, and that's okay, too.  Sometimes before we know, we get ideas of how things could be and get excited and it's natural to feel disappointment when we realize that's not going to be reality.  Then, we shape new ideas and envision new things and get excited again.\n\nNow, if she treats the child differently because of gender, then obviously that's horrible, but gender disappointment in pregnancy is pretty common and, at least according to most of the people on the BabyBumps subreddit, it passes and once your baby is here, you couldn't imagine them being any different.", "but then... why have a gender reveal in public if you are aware there's a 50% chance you're going to have a meltdown?\n\nshe should have confronted the gender in private, or with her husband only, & made peace with it before having a whole party where she begins hyperventilating. c'mon now.", "Seriously...and imagine how embarrassed she must have felt for her reaction, too!  I've cried in public and been mortified, sometimes you can't control it.\n\nThese feelings are incredibly common.  It's normal and people need time to process and envision new things, that's all.", "She said she wasn't sure she was ready for a girl. Which means both that she has a whole load of expectations about what that kid will be like already, and that she went into getting pregnant knowing there's a 50% chance she 'wouldn't be ready' for the baby. Plus, she's not sensible/intelligent enough to realise before she got to 7 months that she might not be having a boy and needs to be prepared for that eventuality, and if she's going to have such a problem with it, *don't find out at a party in front of a bunch of people*.\n\nI say this as someone only a couple years older than her, only a couple months less pregnant than her, and I found out the sex of my baby two days ago. I've been telling myself for pretty much the entire pregnancy that we don't know the sex, we'll love them as much either way, and we aren't going to start off being disappointed in them for their genitals when all that really matters is that this baby we've been wanting for ages is healthy and we can continue this pregnancy safely."]}
