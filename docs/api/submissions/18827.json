That friend somehow registered it as a service animal legally??? So I don't know if anything is technically wrong in the situation. I think I might be the asshole because possibly I'm being nosy and not minding my own business and making a big deal out of nothing at all considering the baby goose passed certification as a service or \"emotional support animal\". I think maybe I could possibly be the asshole because it would upset my best friend that I'd report her friend behind her back.
