That friend somehow registered it as a service animal legally??? So I don't know if anything is technically wrong in the situation. I think I might be the asshole because possibly I'm being nosy and not minding my own business and making a big deal out of nothing at all considering the baby goose passed certification as a service or \"emotional support animal\". I think maybe I could possibly be the asshole because it would upset my best friend that I'd report her friend behind her back. She didn't seem to care or find anything g wrong with it so maybe I am the asshole?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And your friend's friend is a selfish, ignorant asshole for stealing that poor bird. The bird could die if she doesn't properly care for it. At the very least it will suffer because if she gives up on it and releases it, it won't know how to survive in the wild. What she did was selfish and cruel and she deserves to be held accountable.", "Highly doubt this was legally approved. Massachusetts law specifically says that only dogs can be service animals and does not recognize \u201cemotional support animals\u201d, so either your friend is pulling a really elaborate prank on you or they got a bogus certificate off the internet.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s tasteless and you would be NTA for reporting them.", "I don't even see how she could get a certificate for it as a service animal. Either the certificate is fake or this post is fake. My money is on door number two. I've literally been chased by a goose because I accidentally got too close to its gosling.

A mama goose would do her best to kill you if you got near her kids. Hissing, yelling and flat out attacking you.  Terrifying really.
