{"id": 26041, "submission_id": "167j3ld", "title": "AITA for declining to be in the wedding of a marriage I don't agree with?", "selftext": "I was invited to be in my cousins wedding. NOBODY (and I mean nobody) in our family likes the groom. He's rude to her at family gatherings, sits alone by himself, criticizes her every chance he gets in front of her family and is just an all around bad fit for her. Her parents think this, my immediate family all thinks and so does her immediate family. \n\nLast X-mas, a month or so after he proposed to her, we all sat her down and told her that it was a bad idea to follow through with this and that he wasn't right for her at all. She was balling her eyes out at the news of this. Leading up to their proposal, our family made it very clear to her that it wasn't a good fit.\n\nNevertheless, they're getting married next year. My cousin is someone who has struggled holding a boyfriend her entire life. And I believe she finally lowered her bar so far to find this dirtbag of a fiance that she can't imagine leaving him now that she's gotten this far into a relationship.\n\nNow for my issue. I'm being asked to be in the wedding (I've only been in one wedding before (not including my own)) so I'm not quite sure how declining works. According to my sister (who's been in MANY weddings), I cannot say no. If I were to say no, I'd be insulting the bride, groom, both their families and so on. She says if I am to decline I'd be creating ramifications that include being put on my aunt's and uncle's bad sides. Keep in mind, my Aunt and Uncle despise this guy.\n\nI asked my mother the same thing and she said I could always decline and say it's due to financial reasons. But my sister says that's not good enough and that it will still create this detrimental divide between our families.\n\nTLDR;\nAITA for wanting to decline being in a wedding I, and the rest of my entire family, don't agree with? What's the best way to go about this.", "created_utc": 1693602367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167j3ld/aita_for_declining_to_be_in_the_wedding_of_a/", "score": 306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you can decline to be in the wedding. Financial issues and lack of free time on your part are decent excuses.", "NTA.  You can decline by saying \"I decline.\"  And when asked for your reason, you can say \"I don't want to.\"  Why do people think they are owed a reason for decisions made by others.\n\nExample:\n\nI am breaking up with you.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I want to.\n\nEnd of story.", "NTA\n\nThe way I went about declining was just saying \"No thanks, I don't want to be a bridesmaid\" and that was for the wedding of an immediate family member which I did approve of.\n\nYour cousin already knows her whole family don't approve of the wedding so I don't see why you can't just tell her the real reason.\n\nYour sister's reaction seems overly dramatic.  Is the only reason she's been involved in so many weddings because she thinks being a bridesmaid is like jury duty and you can't turn it down?", "Without knowing your culture, it is difficult to say whether it is socially acceptable to decline being in the wedding. In Midwestern white culture, it is absolutely not in poor taste to decline to be in the wedding party for a variety of reasons. That said, I would think about it deeply. From your description, this does sound like a bad decision, but if you are not supportive of her you could end up pushing her away from her family eliminating her support network for when she finally does realize that this was a bad idea. If this is a close cousin, she will need you by her side.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, I would decline.  These days on Reddit, it seems that bridesmaids are usually asked to do a TON of ridiculous shit, and spend a ton of money. That's maybe OK for a good friend, but not OK for someone you don't even support.  \n\n\nYour sister can feel free to volunteer, if she wants.  So can your mom.  But they don't run your life.", "You can always decline to be in a wedding, and you can tell your cousin as much or as little about why.

Tell your cousin \u201cno thank you\u201d and tell her the honest reason why.  There is no reason to lie.  Sometimes people have to experience disappointment and uncomfortable feelings. It\u2019s life and it\u2019s normal.  An honest relationship is a healthy relationship.", "NTA either way you decide to go. I'd personally be guided by your cousins parents, although I'd also set very clear boundaries if the groom is a nightmare, and make it clear if they are violated you are walking away if things start getting tricky, and be ready to do so calmly.", "NTA decline and say you\u2019re sorry, but wish them well. Tell them that your sister volunteered to do it on your behalf.", "NTA. After all, you can do whatever you want with your time. Tough in turn your cousin would have the right to be disappointed too. I'd recommend going there just for the sake of your cousin, to enable her to have this one special day. It's more about the gesture and I don't think she'd hold any grudges if you left early bc you're \"tired\"", "NTA sounds like your cousin is in an abusive relationship from your description though and she might need her family to stay close to her. So maybe just politely decline so she still feels like she can count on you when the shit eventually hits the fan. \"Cousin, I love you so much and if you were marrying literally anyone else who treated you with respect, I would happily stand. I will always always be here for you, but I don't support this decision. I'm sorry.\"", "NTA to decline, they\u2019ve asked you, not commanded. \n\nHowever, your family have already expressed their concerns to your cousin in such a way that she was left devastated and in tears. She\u2019s probably already feeling isolated from her family as a result, and likely questions what kind of support she has. Continuing to push this divide would be asshole behaviour on the part of your whole family. \n\nSome food for thought, though. If I were in your shoes, I would agree to be in the wedding so that your cousin knows she has support and love. She will need it if the marriage doesn\u2019t last and she needs someone to turn to. Knowing she has someone\u2019s love and support unconditionally would be so beneficial for her. And if the marriage does last, you may regret saying no if fianc\u00e9 ends up proving you all wrong and you\u2019ve pushed your cousin away for nothing.", "YTA if you do it because you don\u2019t like the groom.  If you think the guys a dirt bag eventually you might realize it to.  You don\u2019t go now and she likely never forgives you and now has one less person to support her when things go crashing down.\n\nIf it was because you just didn\u2019t want to do it then you wouldn\u2019t have been the asshole", "NTA. You give no backgrounds on your family so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s to do with that the issue with not being able to decline? Certainly where I am declining is ok and wouldn\u2019t really cause issues. Just tell her why you don\u2019t want to be part of it, she already knows you and everyone else think the marriage is a bad idea so it\u2019s hardly like it will come as a massive shock.", "You don't have to say yes. By saying yes, you're saying you approve of the wedding. If you decide to say no (I think you should) just be there for her down the road when her marriage falls apart.", "NTA, but please consider doing what you can to remain a part of your cousin's life. This is already an abusive relationship, and it's not going to get any better. If you can remain in her life, avoid being driven away by her partner, you could possibly be the person she turns to when she finally wakes up.", "NTA BUT, consider doing it anyway to keep the lines of communication open and keep the groom thinking you are \u2018safe\u2019 for her to socialize with. She may need help escaping this marriage later in. You don\u2019t have to socialize with him after the wedding, but be polite for her sake.", "NTA you're free to not go\n\nBUT\n\nYour family needs to sit her down again, and tell her that you wall will always be there for HER, whether she stays with this man or she changes her mind later on and wants to leave. If he's mistreating her for you all to see, he's going to be wildly abusive behind closed doors once she's his wife and he feels he has her trapped.\n\nYour family needs to leave the door wide open for her, for her to know that she can make that call day or night and someone will go get her, to take her to safety.", "Don't do it, your sister is ridiculous? Nta", "You absolutely CAN say no, and you absolutely should say no. You may get some blow-back from family members (or maybe not if they all agree with you), and you probably will get blow-back from your cousin, but that's life. You don't want to do it. You are under no obligation to do it. That's really all there is to it. Just say no.", "NTA - if you decline, will they ask your sister? If so - let know how it goes for her!\n\nBut I would politely say you aren't up to the commitment, keep it vague but firm.", "Your sister doesn't know wtf she's talking about. You absolutely can decline (seriously, wtf is wrong with your sister, lmao). Go ahead & decline, NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obliged to be anyone\u2019s bridesmaid. It is a voluntary thing.", "You u have to say no.  Morally you can\u2019t support her marrying a narcissist (my 2c opinion).\n\nBeing in the bridal party is endorsing and supporting the marriage.\n\n\u201cDear <name>, I cannot be your bridesmaid. It would be wrong of me to be a participant in your wedding  to this abusive man. I love you and could not live with myself.

You absolutely should not be a part of a wedding you don't agree with. \n\nIt's hard to advise on how to decline without knowing your exact circumstances, but here are some ideas. \n\n\\- \"Sorry, I can't I have a another commitment.\" Then create another commitment, so it's not strictly a lie.  And then say as little as possible about what that commitment is. \n\n\\- \"Sorry, I am unable to do this\", and if they ask why, you can say \"It's for personal reasons.\"  This isn't a lie. \n\n\\- \"Sorry, I won't be in town\", and then arrange to be out of town, so it isn't a lie. \n\nGood luck.", "NAH.  While I totally understand your position, my question to you is how close are you to your cousin? If the answer is close and you want to keep it that way, make up an excuse.  Otherwise, this could permanently damage your relationship and she's only going to remember you as the person who didn't support her.  Look, is she making a mistake? Yep. But relationships and love and support shouldn't be conditional and given only when you agree.  Sometimes you need to let people make their own mistakes.  It sucks.", "You absolutely can decline. Anyone can decline being in a wedding party for any reason, including finances, schedule, or they simply don\u2019t want to. I would not pretend the reason is financial. That could bite you if she turns around and offers to pay, lowers the prices on things, you get asked to be in some other wedding and say yes and she finds out, etc. You can either simply say, I\u2019m honored that you thought of me but I am not able to be a bridesmaid but will attend as a guest. \n\nIf you don\u2019t plan on attending the wedding at all. Then skip the last part. You could try to leave it as simple as that.

You do not have to provide a reason. 50% of the time being is a wedding is a merable money put, and that is when I like both people AND think they aren't making a mistake. \n\nSomething worth thinking about is whether you could stomach it to support of your cousin. Not of her marriage, but to show her that no matter what, she matters to you. \n\nAfter the intervention, she may feel very isolated from your family. If that persists - or worsens - and she realizes eventually that marrying him was a mistake, the isolation might make it more difficult for her to leave him. It is hard to admit a mistake.

If you feel it's Vital to not just stick with the simple \"no\" and the dates already been set.  Your mom's financial reasons works.  Or \"I have a major project/busy time at work then, can't get it off.\"  I've already planned X (pick something, and if needs be plan it after).  \n\nHowever personally because of the reason and how bad you indicate this is personally I'd go with \"No, I will not be a part of nor attend this wedding.  If and when you need to get away from this man please contact me.  However since I can not in any way be happy about this decision I will be remaining far away from the wedding itself.\"", "NTA. Decline, But please let your cousin know that if things go bad, you will always be there for her.", "I was in a wedding for a friend that I knew wasn't a good idea, but I wanted to be supportive of her and went along anyway. To no real surprise, they were divorced a little after a year in. They were both very young and now have a failed marriage in their past. I wish I would have had the guts to tell her what I really thought and not tiptoed around her to keep the friendship, which is long dead now. So absolutely NTA.", "NTA\n\nYOU CAN SAY \"NO\" TO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.  AND THAT INCLUDES PARTICIPATING IN THIS OR ANY OTHER WEDDING.\n\nAnd.....wait for it....you don't need to make up a reason.  Just say \"No.\"  You can include a \"thank you\" with that \"No\" to be polite.  I'm not sure if your sister is trying to manipulate you or just has absolutely no clue, but you are absolutely not obligated to do anything for, or during, this wedding.\n\nJust say \"No,\" and leave it there. You all sat her down and voiced your concerns about her relationship.  By not being part of the wedding party, you are simply following through.  If you'd be okay attending and not being part of the wedding party, that's up to you.  \n\nIf you really need a response to being asked to be part of the wedding party, simply say that you aren't able to commit to doing it.  If you get pushback (which would be weird, given that your cousin knows how you all feel and would be wise to take a polite decline), you can simply state that you politely responded to the request, and that any further communication on the subject would simply be bad manners.", "In this situation I would say do it. You have all made your point now she needs your love. Love is an action, do it so she knows where to turn to if she needs help in the future. If you can\u2019t choose her now then YTA", "Nta...but if you can financially do so plan a bachelorette weekend to get this girl away from him like a weekend with no phones so that she'll be free of him for a bit it may help her realize that she doesn't need to be in this relationship", "NTA\nIf you want to decline, just do it. Say no, whoever is angry let them be your replacement. If your cousin is that desperate to wed someone that doesn't respect her, you don't have to be there. Remember no is a complete sentence", "NTA, I think your sister is being a bit dramatic. Especially considering that the bride's own family dislikes the groom.", "I was asked to be a bridesmaid by a girl I really didn\u2019t know that well and also thought she was horrible to her fianc\u00e9.  She actually asked me at a party when we were all drinking, I said \u2018yes\u2019.  Next day I sobered up and really regretted it, how could I stand up there when I thought the groom was making a horrible mistake?  I called her and said upon rethinking it I just felt I wasn\u2019t the right person.  I felt enormous relief, she was very upset and badmouthed me all over but I knew I did the right thing.  They weren\u2019t married long.", "This is good advice. \n\nBetter a white lie then a truth that will not make a difference and could hurt your relationship with your cousin. \n\nShe already knows how you and everyone else feels about the marriage and she is moving forward with it anyways. As much as it might pain you, you have to let her do that. \n\nNTA.", "Goes right into the \u201cNo is a complete sentence\u201d answer.  And since she is family, maybe no thank you", "NTA. Exactly, in my opinion no one is obligated to accept a part in the wedding. I was a bridesmaid to my friends wedding and honestly I did not like her fianc\u00e9. I spent more money on that wedding than my own (we eloped) and I would honestly NEVER do it again. The money alone was wild. You don\u2019t owe anyone anything", "Absolutely. I guess I'm just not as polite as some people but I would have no problem saying, \"Because the groom's an AH and I want no part in this.\" Nobody will ask any more questions after that. These people saying OP should decline for \"financial reasons\" have no spine.", "Maybe for strangers but for family who generally care about and are interested in each other, this isn\u2019t how it works.", "Lol this is an insane take on how to have normal human interactions", "This. \ud83d\udcaf. Was gonna say something similar, but you said it better. NTA.", "It\u2019s really not. There are concepts to drill this into people\u2019s heads because it\u2019s so hard for so many people to understand:\n\n- \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.\n\n- You don\u2019t have to JADE (justify argue defend explain) your decisions or your choices to anyone\n\n- This isn\u2019t a court of law. It\u2019s not your job to make people agree with or understand your choices. You can simply present them. The breaking up is a perfect example. You can break up for any reason. You don\u2019t need the other person\u2019s agreement to break up, and they can\u2019t tell you that they aren\u2019t allowing the breakup to occur.\n\n\nOverall, you set and enforce healthy boundaries. In fact, you should go get some books because your understanding of healthy adult communication is flawed.", "Why?", "You\u2019re fine, if they feel lying is better in this situation then they are spineless. You are right. These guys never heard of tough love."]}
