{"id": 26041, "submission_id": "167j3ld", "title": "AITA for declining to be in the wedding of a marriage I don't agree with?", "selftext": "I was invited to be in my cousins wedding. NOBODY (and I mean nobody) in our family likes the groom. He's rude to her at family gatherings, sits alone by himself, criticizes her every chance he gets in front of her family and is just an all around bad fit for her. Her parents think this, my immediate family all thinks and so does her immediate family. \n\nLast X-mas, a month or so after he proposed to her, we all sat her down and told her that it was a bad idea to follow through with this and that he wasn't right for her at all. She was balling her eyes out at the news of this. Leading up to their proposal, our family made it very clear to her that it wasn't a good fit.\n\nNevertheless, they're getting married next year. My cousin is someone who has struggled holding a boyfriend her entire life. And I believe she finally lowered her bar so far to find this dirtbag of a fiance that she can't imagine leaving him now that she's gotten this far into a relationship.\n\nNow for my issue. I'm being asked to be in the wedding (I've only been in one wedding before (not including my own)) so I'm not quite sure how declining works. According to my sister (who's been in MANY weddings), I cannot say no. If I were to say no, I'd be insulting the bride, groom, both their families and so on. She says if I am to decline I'd be creating ramifications that include being put on my aunt's and uncle's bad sides. Keep in mind, my Aunt and Uncle despise this guy.\n\nI asked my mother the same thing and she said I could always decline and say it's due to financial reasons. But my sister says that's not good enough and that it will still create this detrimental divide between our families.\n\nTLDR;\nAITA for wanting to decline being in a wedding I, and the rest of my entire family, don't agree with? What's the best way to go about this.", "created_utc": 1693602367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167j3ld/aita_for_declining_to_be_in_the_wedding_of_a/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you can decline to be in the wedding. Financial issues and lack of free time on your part are decent excuses.", "NTA.  You can decline by saying \"I decline.\"  And when asked for your reason, you can say \"I don't want to.\"  Why do people think they owed a reason for decisions made by others.\n\nExample:\n\nI am breaking up with you.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I want to.\n\nEnd of story.", "NTA\n\nThe way I went about declining was just saying \"No thanks, I don't want to be a bridesmaid\" and that was for the wedding of an immediate family member which I did approve of.\n\nYour cousin already knows her whole family don't approve of the wedding so I don't see why you can't just tell her the real reason.\n\nYour sister's reaction seems overly dramatic.  Is the only reason she's been involved in so many weddings because she thinks being a bridesmaid is like jury duty and you can't turn it down?", "Without knowing your culture, it is difficult to say whether it is socially acceptable to decline being in the wedding. In Midwestern white culture, it is absolutely not in poor taste to decline to be in the wedding party for a variety of reasons. That said, I would think about it deeply. From your description, this does sound like a bad decision, but if you are not supportive of her you could end up pushing her away from her family eliminating her support network for when she finally does realize that this was a bad idea. If this is a close cousin, she will need you by her side.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, I would decline.  These days on Reddit, it seems that bridesmaids are usually asked to do a TON of ridiculous shit, and spend a ton of money. That's maybe OK for a good friend, but not OK for someone you don't even support.  \n\n\nYour sister can feel free to volunteer, if she wants.  So can your mom.  But they don't run your life.", "You can always decline to be in a wedding, and you can tell your cousin as much or as little about why. If you think it really will create family drama, ask your aunt and uncle ahead of time what their thoughts are.", "NTA. You are not in any way obligated to be in this wedding. Tell your cousin \u201cno thank you\u201d and tell her the honest reason why.  There is no reason to lie.  Sometimes people have to experience disappointment and uncomfortable feelings. It\u2019s life and it\u2019s normal.  An honest relationship is a healthy relationship.", "NTA either way you decide to go. I'd personally be guided by your cousins parents, although I'd also set very clear boundaries if the groom is a nightmare, and make it clear if they are violated you are walking away if things start getting tricky, and be ready to do so calmly.", "NTA decline and say you\u2019re sorry, but wish them well. Tell them that your sister volunteered to do it on your behalf.", "NTA. After all, you can do whatever you want with your time. Tough in turn your cousin would have the right to be disappointed too. I'd recommend going there just for the sake of your cousin, to enable her to have this one special day. It's more about the gesture and I don't think she'd hold any grudges if you left early bc you're \"tired\"", "NTA sounds like your cousin is in an abusive relationship from your description though and she might need her family to stay close to her. So maybe just politely decline so she still feels like she can count on you when the shit eventually hits the fan. \"Cousin, I love you so much and if you were marrying literally anyone else who treated you with respect, I would happily stand. I will always always be here for you, but I don't support this decision. I'm sorry.\"", "NTA to decline, they\u2019ve asked you, not commanded. \n\nHowever, your family have already expressed their concerns to your cousin in such a way that she was left devastated and in tears. She\u2019s probably already feeling isolated from her family as a result, and likely questions what kind of support she has. Continuing to push this divide would be asshole behaviour on the part of your whole family. \n\nSome food for thought, though. If I were in your shoes, I would agree to be in the wedding so that your cousin knows she has support and love. She will need it if the marriage doesn\u2019t last and she needs someone to turn to. Knowing she has someone\u2019s love and support unconditionally would be so beneficial for her. And if the marriage does last, you may regret saying no if fianc\u00e9 ends up proving you all wrong and you\u2019ve pushed your cousin away for nothing.", "YTA if you do it because you don\u2019t like the groom.  If you think the guys a dirt bag eventually you might realize it to.  You don\u2019t go now and she likely never forgives you and now has one less person to support her when things go crashing down.\n\nIf it was because you just didn\u2019t want to do it then you wouldn\u2019t have been the asshole", "NTA. You give no backgrounds on your family so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s to do with that the issue with not being able to decline? Certainly where I am declining is ok and wouldn\u2019t really cause issues. Just tell her why you don\u2019t want to be part of it, she already knows you and everyone else think the marriage is a bad idea so it\u2019s hardly like it will come as a massive shock.", "You don't have to say yes. By saying yes, you're saying you approve of the wedding. If you decide to say no (I think you should) just be there for her down the road when her marriage falls apart.", "NTA, but please consider doing what you can to remain a part of your cousin's life. This is already an abusive relationship, and it's not going to get any better. If you can remain in her life, avoid being driven away by her partner, you could possibly be the person she turns to when she finally wakes up.", "NTA BUT, consider doing it anyway to keep the lines of communication open and keep the groom thinking you are \u2018safe\u2019 for her to socialize with. She may need help escaping this marriage later in. You don\u2019t have to socialize with him after the wedding, but be polite for her sake.", "NTA you're free to not go\n\nBUT\n\nYour family needs to sit her down again, and tell her that you wall will always be there for HER, whether she stays with this man or she changes her mind later on and wants to leave. If he's mistreating her for you all to see, he's going to be wildly abusive behind closed doors once she's his wife and he feels he has her trapped.\n\nYour family needs to leave the door wide open for her, for her to know that she can make that call day or night and someone will go get her, to take her to safety.", "Don't do it, your sister is ridiculous? Nta", "You absolutely CAN say no, and you absolutely should say no. You may get some blow-back from family members (or maybe not if they all agree with you), and you probably will get blow-back from your cousin, but that's life. You don't want to do it. You are under no obligation to do it. That's really all there is to it. Just say no.", "NTA - if you decline, will they ask your sister? If so - let know how it goes for her!\n\nBut I would politely say you aren't up to the commitment, keep it vague but firm.", "Your sister doesn't know wtf she's talking about. You absolutely can decline (seriously, wtf is wrong with your sister, lmao). Go ahead & decline, NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obliged to be anyone\u2019s bridesmaid. It is a voluntary thing.", "You u have to say no.  Morally you can\u2019t support her marrying a narcissist (my 2c opinion).\n\nBeing in the bridal party is endorsing and supporting the marriage.\n\n\u201cDear <name>, I cannot be your bridesmaid. It would be wrong of me to be a participant in your wedding  to this abusive man. I love you and could not live with myself.  We can\u2019t stop you from marrying him, because you\u2019re a grown woman and can makes your own decisions, but I cannot be a part of it. Xx <your name>\u201d\n\nNah", "Definitely NTA.  You absolutely should not be a part of a wedding you don't agree with. \n\nIt's hard to advise on how to decline without knowing your exact circumstances, but here are some ideas. \n\n\\- \"Sorry, I can't I have a another commitment.\" Then create another commitment, so it's not strictly a lie.  And then say as little as possible about what that commitment is. \n\n\\- \"Sorry, I am unable to do this\", and if they ask why, you can say \"It's for personal reasons.\"  This isn't a lie. \n\n\\- \"Sorry, I won't be in town\", and then arrange to be out of town, so it isn't a lie. \n\nGood luck.", "NAH.  While I totally understand your position, my question to you is how close are you to your cousin? If the answer is close and you want to keep it that way, make up an excuse.  Otherwise, this could permanently damage your relationship and she's only going to remember you as the person who didn't support her.  Look, is she making a mistake? Yep. But relationships and love and support shouldn't be conditional and given only when you agree.  Sometimes you need to let people make their own mistakes.  It sucks.", "You absolutely can decline. Anyone can decline being in a wedding party for any reason, including finances, schedule, or they simply don\u2019t want to. I would not pretend the reason is financial. That could bite you if she turns around and offers to pay, lowers the prices on things, you get asked to be in some other wedding and say yes and she finds out, etc. You can either simply say, I\u2019m honored that you thought of me but I am not able to be a bridesmaid but will attend as a guest. \n\nIf you don\u2019t plan on attending the wedding at all. Then skip the last part. You could try to leave it as simple as that. If she pushes and pushes, you will prob have to be honest at some point, but do it as gently as possible.", "What is your sister on about, people decline being part of wedding parties all the time!  Your mom is right, just say it's financial and you're good.  NTA.", "In addition, could also say \u201cI don\u2019t want to hold any responsibility, I would be most comfortable being a guest only\u201d.", "Or.... **OR!!!** OP Accept to be the maid of honor **AND** kidnap the bride on the day of the wedding!   \nBang!  \nProblem solved.   \n**OR** just deny it **AND ALSO** kidnap her too. Your choice.", "LMAO.", "Hahaha. I\u2019m picturing those fake videos of jury selection with the potential bridesmaid victims grasping at excuses. \u201cI can\u2019t find childcare\u201d (says the childless one) \u201cI\u2019m too injured\u201d (faking a limp) \n\nSister sounds like she equates being a bridesmaid with a military draft.", "Offer your sister as tribute, OP (you know since she can\u00b4t deny it, right? Right?)  \nThrow Katniss in the games!", "This! I\u2019ve actually been in essentially this same situation. I did do the wedding (as the dirtbag fianc\u00e9s groomsman) but I\u2019ve also been clear my opinion on him. When they time came that my cousin was ready to divorce him she came first to me cause I was patient and understand with her feeling rather than being like you\u2019re wrong and I\u2019m not coming to the wedding. \n\nCan\u2019t tell people who to fall for unfortunately", "\"But I've got flat feet.  There's no way I can wear heels.\"", "I\u2019m allergic to flowers. And the color white. If I look at it I get hives. And music. Yeah, it just started last week after my own wedding. Super strange, I know."]}
