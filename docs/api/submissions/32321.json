He clearly has an ego problem, and I'll bet he very much expects to be the boss in this marriage.\n\nI really hope this guy never has kids.", "NTA.

It's better to cut your losses now than be trapped in a relationship where you're back posting here after you've been married a year because he's being controlling and has you questioning yourself.  \nThe age difference is a bit concerning, but also any guy aged 8 - 108 who wants you to get rid of your cat because it likes you better than him has some issues that you're not going to be able to fix.", "NTA. Take the cat, leave the bf.", "Nta but girl, i hope you dont take me the wrong way. Why are you getting married to a 25yo ? Is he grooming you? No this is not okay. You are barely legal.

I can\u2019t see all of this ending well.", "NTA  but think very carefully about this relationship. Your BF is jealous of your cat. Your BF wants you to abandon your pet  - that's cruel to the cat , it's also concerning that he wants you to get rid of something you love and which means a lot to you .\n\nFrankly, it doesn't sound as though your BF would be much of a loss.  In a healthy relationship, both parties want their partner to be happy. Both partners recognise that a degree of compromise is needed, both partners have respect for each other. Your BF is doing none of those things - he knows that rehoming your cat would make you unhappy and would mean you were giving up something that matters to you, but he is putting you under pressure to do it despite that. That's incredibly selfish of him.\n\nYour BF knew you had the cat rom when you and he got together, but he is still seeking to change that .\n\nYour BF is not giving any reason for wanting you to get rid of the cat other than that the cat hasn't bonded closely with him. That's incredibly self-centred .\n\nAt BEST , your BF is being incredibly selfish and immature.\n\nAt WORST at worst, these are signs of an abusive relationship. \n\nHe is displaying controlling behaviour, which is typical of abusive relationships. Abusive partners tend to try to control their spouse or partner, part of which is often seeking to isolate them from support networks such as family and friends to make them isolated and more dependent on their abuser, abusers are also often intolerant of any rival for their partner's affection, such as pets, children, even responsibilities such as jobs). It is also common that abusive people gradually increase the level of control and abuse.", "Break off the engagement. Your boyfriend has serious control issues. Who knows what else he\u2019s going to start ordering you to do?\n\nIf he were allergic, I\u2019d cut him some slack, but this is about the fact that the cat prefers you to him. What does that even say? That every living creature, including friends, had to prefer him over you or else you\u2019re not allowed to have them?\n\nI\u2019d tell him where to go and how to get there.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGive away your AH fiance.

Going to marry. Unless they've been on a really accelerated relationship, they've been dating at least a year? So she was 18 (or younger) and he 24? And he's super controlling?

Honestly I'd worry there may have even been grooming involved to get things there. \n\nSorry, this has all kinds of red flags, and the thing with the cat really is just a shining example of why.\n\nAlso, strictly on the question of the cat: he knew you had the cat when he expressed interest of you. He can fuck himself if he thinks you are going to get rid of it.", "Oh wow, that's creepy as hell. He was seeing you as a sexual / romantic partner while you were still a minor. \n\nHonestly, the more you say about this person the bigger the red flags keep getting", "Sorry OP, but talk and behaviour like that is super groom-y (and not in the marriage way), you should really not marry this dude\u2026 he will control you and make you miserable, and when you\u2019re \u201ctoo old\u201d he will cheat on you with someone way younger.", "So he was grooming you for years."]}
