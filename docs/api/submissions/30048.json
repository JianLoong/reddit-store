Paxton is currently in a private school in 8th grade. Both kids went to different private schools that are pretty far apart from each other.\n\nPaxton\u2019s school is majority minority, has a large Asian American community (mostly Chinese). As a result, most of Paxton\u2019s friends are Chinese-American. Paxton knows a lot about Chinese culture as a result and is even fluent in Mandarin, from both school and private lessons we\u2019ve taken him to. Paxton also does stereotypical American things with his friends, like play baseball and basketball. Being on sports teams has definitely helped him build relationships with those who are different as well.\n\nLakelyn has always gone to schools that were majority white. She doesn\u2019t have many non-white friends.\n\nTwo weeks ago, both Lakelyn and Paxton had some friends over, my wife and I were out for a dinner date.\n\nShortly after we got home, the friends started to leave the house. Once everyone was gone, Paxton said he wanted to talk to my wife and I.\n\nPaxton was showing us a video, and in it Lakelyn and her friends were making extremely racist jokes about his friends, from jokes about eating bats to jokes about the eye size of the boys he\u2019s friends with and more.\n\nMy wife and I were horrified, as were the parents of the girls we called to tell them what had happened. The parents of the girls Lakelyn is friends with and us planned on an effort to how to deal with their behavior.\n\nLakelyn and her friends will be going to various Asian history museums, along with being forced to write an apology to the boys. We decided to start taking the girls to the museums this weekend, the freshman dance at the high school is on Saturday.\n\nLakelyn has been begging us to go, saying what she did wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and that we are \u201cbeing biased in favor of Paxton\u201d by \u201cruining her social life to appeal to him.\u201d Paxton never asked for this punishment. Lakelyn is also saying that the punishment is unfair and that I wouldn\u2019t know because \u201cyou\u2019re autistic, you don\u2019t understand\u201d (I am but my wife isn\u2019t).\n\nI asked some of my NT coworkers to see if this was a fair punishment, some of them agreed it was but others said me, my wife and the other parents are acting unreasonable.

I think it is a better punishment than takin away their phones or forbidding them to go out. It teaches things and hopefully it will help them grow. \n\n\n\nI am curious now, why do they go to very separate private schools?", "NTA, but OP I think there\u2019s a scary underlying trend with your daughter. Not only is she mocking other races and cultures, which is bad enough, and not only is she trying to minimize her own actions, but she is trying to weaponize your autism against you. That\u2019s not just a \u201cwhoopise I did a racism\u201d that is calculated gaslighting. The fact she used that so quickly is very troubling.", "Good for you, OP. This punishment sounds very appropriate and proportional. She\u2019s a freshman, there will be more dances. Racism IS a big deal, and the fact that she wants to write it off proves even more that she needs to understand the consequences. Thank you for not only working to correct your daughter\u2019s behavior, but collaborating with her friends\u2019 parents to do this as a group!\n\nNTA!!!!", "Anyone else notice a trend in AITA stories that feature a pair of siblings, with one sibling (typically a brother) being a sporty popular kid who is friends with someone who is a minority/marginalized in some way (e.g. autistic, poc, gay, etc.) and the other sibling (always a sister) being rude/bigoted towards said friend, which then results in the parents punishing the daughter by taking away something the daughter was looking forward to?", "Wasn't there a similar post a few weeks ago where there's a sib being racist and not allowed to go to a dance/prom etc?", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think a museum is going to cut it. I didn\u2019t learn to love a specific artist from attending an exhibit. I just went because my spouse wanted to. My other comment here was serious about Lakelyn switching schools. If not, perhaps finding a club or other activities where she is exposed to a more diverse group of people and spends less time with her current group of friends.", "It\u2019s ridiculous how many stories are posted here about a racist daughter getting mad about not getting to go to a dance because she did something racist to her brother and his friends. It\u2019s always the same. \n\nNTA", "NTA - As a parent it is your job to help develop her morals and values.  This is a good lesson.

She has developed some prejudices and doesn't even acknowledge them as issues.  Only when she sees there are consequences will she learn a lesson.  Had she made a full and sincere apology, then maybe reconsider, but as a parent of a child showing these detestable preconceptions, you need to get her attention and show that those are not yours or your family's values.  When she is grown, she can do as she pleases, but this is a 14yo who is living under your roof and you have a responsibility to raise a healthy well balanced person.  You are not the AH for teaching her a lesson, and following though to make sure she understands prejudice is not tolerated.", "NTA. As her parent you have to teach her your values.  It's your job.", "Also INFO: why do your kids go to different schools?", "YTA for those names lakelyn really. Please tell me that they are just radical fake names.", "NTA", "NTA - Your daughter was very insensitive and rude. Your disciplinary decision is multi-faceted and not over the top at all. \n\nHad you wanted to be more \u201cfair,\u201d I suppose you could have involved her in the decision. For example\u2026 instead of taking away the dance, what privilege would she prefer to lose instead? Phone for a week? Friends over?

But your daughter sounds like an awful one.", "NTA..she's racist and needs to learn. 20 years from now this dance won't matter.", "NTA and good for you for making her take responsibility for her actions, and losing a privilege. I'm not surprised some of your co-workers said the punishment is unreasonable. I hate to sound like the old fuddy duddy I am, but so many kids are coddled and never have to face consequences for their actions.

Middle school dances are not more important than learning to treat other humans with respect. \n\nNTA.", "YTA, those names are punishment enough for a whole lifetime of screwups. On a more serious note, this kind of punishment doesn't really seem like it will do more than focus the childrens' frustration towards your son's friends. Don't make them or other AAPI people part of the punishment.\n\nSide note, you should also have a conversation about recording girls without their consent.", "NTA - this sounds like a super fair, appropriate punishment to me. I think missing the freshman dance is also appropriate. As a former teenage girl, she's upset she's missing out, but that's nothing compared to the pain she caused her brother's friends. And, IMO, being social means having social responsibility - which means not being a complete asshole to others, which your daughter and her friends did not demonstrate at all. \n\nI can tell that both of your kids are really smart. Make sure you talk with your daughter about her actions, why she thought her behavior was funny, etc. If she's doing that in her own home, she could be behaving this way elsewhere, too. If her behavior continues or escalates, what's next? Make sure you lay it out for her that you won't tolerate this now, and you won't tolerate it later. Maybe you need to find some ways to build more diversity into her life. \n\nAlso, I really applaud your son for standing up to his sister - that is not easy, and it's admirable.", " Information wanted:  Why would you put your children in two drastically different private schools???? You state that they are also far apart so this isn't and age thing. I get the feeling this had to do with one being a boy and one being a girl.  There seems to be very important missing information here. More Information is needed. \n    You are teaching them to be biased but put them in two different environments.", "I get the vibe that your daughter is right that Paxton is your favorite.\n\nBut NTA\n\nEdited for clarification: OP spends half the post gushing about Paxton with info that is unnecessary to the post about how great and smart he is.", "Hoo boy. I\u2019m gonna lead with NTA, but I gotta break this down:\n\nFirst, your daughter has some serious problems, some of which I get the feeling that you haven\u2019t fully understood or accepted. First:\n\n> Lakelyn has been begging us to go, saying what she did wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and that we are \u201cbeing biased in favor of Paxton\u201d by \u201cruining her social life to appeal to him.\u201d \n\nThe obvious issue is that she and her friends engaged, as a group, in racism against your son and his friends. It\u2019s only a year, but they\u2019re older too, so it\u2019s doubly bad. I am glad you\u2019re addressing it but the issue here isn\u2019t sensitivity\u2026they need to learn it is wrong. The path to that is by issuing real and true consequences.\n\n> Paxton never asked for this punishment.\n\nNot the issue. Don\u2019t let your daughter distract you with a straw man. The point here is that her arguing this shows she doesn\u2019t understand the magnitude of her fuck up and doesn\u2019t accept as a core concept that racism is wrong.\n\n> Lakelyn is also saying that the punishment is unfair and that I wouldn\u2019t know because \u201cyou\u2019re autistic, you don\u2019t understand\u201d (I am but my wife isn\u2019t).\n\nHere your own daughter is trying to manipulate you by weaponizing your autism against you. This is an extreme offense, and were she my child, she would suffer another penalty on top of that for her racism. \n\nOverall, it boils down to me like she\u2019s getting some bad influence from her friends at her current school, since your son is fine, it\u2019s obviously not your parenting, at least not directly. She has learned racism despite having a brother with lots of Asian friends, (or perhaps your family itself is Asian to a degree? Can\u2019t tell), and she\u2019s also learned to try to manipulate people by using their weaknesses against them. Both are big, serious S-tier social development problems. \n\nSeriously consider addressing this fast, hard, and with serious consequences and actions. I\u2019d suggest moving her out of her school into a different one, getting her into some therapy, and taking away her social media privileges - some of these measures are intended to separate her from her friends who obviously are a problem. And do it fast. She\u2019s 14, and social development is key during these years. She needs time to develop a new social network that doesn\u2019t include racist kids. I also need you to understand you cannot trust that the other kids that are part of this problem may be properly dealt with, and there\u2019s a chance their parents are racist as well and won\u2019t handle it properly. There are big risks in letting yourself be blind to these issues, and take a gamble on them. Balance this carefully.\n\nAlso, do some research on manipulative behavior in children and how it develops and how to deal with it. Cause like it or not, that\u2019s now a primary problem for you, with her.", "NTA in this situation, but I wonder how your daughter got to be this much of a brat", "NTA.\n\nAs long as she keeps claiming it's not a big deal, she isn't getting it.\n\nI think you should add some education regarding the horrors of racism to the mix. Her ableism doesn't make it better.", "Yeah NTA. I mean telling you you wouldn\u2019t understand is pretty damn ableist and I\u2019d be pissed (I\u2019m high functioning autistic as well). \n\nNot only that, her blatant racism is astounding", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she goes to college with minorities she will get eaten alive by social justice warriors.  They won\u2019t be as nice as the punishment you are giving.", "NTA. Allowing this behavior to go unchecked would make you axxholes. Your daughter needs a serious reality check or you might have to watch her turn into an absolute monster of a human being. She should have zero expectation of getting to enjoy her social life after being a racist little shit and making her brother\u2019s friends unsafe in your home. \n\nConsider what those boys have told their parents and how they now think of your family. If I were them, your home would now be off limits as dangerous to my child. That will have a nasty impact on your son and your family\u2019s place in your community. All that because your daughter is a hate filled brat. Honestly, I don\u2019t think I could continue paying tuition to a private school that helped her develop these attitudes. Maybe a diverse public school will teach her some tolerance.", "NTA, _but_ I don't think punishing her by restricting her from going to school events is particularly constructive.\n\nFirst, I question how it got to this point. Why did your kids go to different schools for so long? Why did you send her to a majority-white school? Why does this behavior come as a surprise to you? Shouldn't you _know_ your daughter? Shouldn't you have been exposing her to other cultures and ethnicities _before_ this point? It feels like you dropped the ball here.\n\nBut of course, done is done, and all you can do is choose what to do differently _going forward_. And as others have said, her behavior is atrocious and she sounds downright manipulative in addition to the racism.\n\nMaking her apologize makes sense. Trying to educate her makes sense, but I wouldn't expect it to make a huge differece. She's not going to go \"ooooh, I see now, I will be a better person going forward\". She's going to be angry and upset, and reject everything she is supposed to learn from the museum out of spite. So your job is not done just because you do this on _one_ weekend.\n\nGrounding her is an extremely American thing to do (it's the answer to _any_ transgression, it seems like), and as a non-American I don't see it working. Perhaps that's my cultural bias speaking, and if you want to ground her, go ahead. I just don't think it's going to change her views, and making her resentful probably won't make it _easier_ to change her views.\n\nBut what I'm really missing here is some reckoning with this on a deeper level. The problem didn't arise over a weekend, and you won't be able to fix it in a weekend either. You can't just ground her, make her spend an afternoon at a museum and then assume that your job is done and your daughter is cured of racism.\n\nIt sounds like the social environment at her school is where this is coming from. What, if anything, is the school doing about it? Should she continue to go to this school? Ask yourself what has been going wrong to get here, and what you will change going forward to fix it.", "Nta but why are they going to such different schools?", "Hmmmm, good for your for teaching your daughter to try and right her wrongs in positive way, and for educating her through the museums. What she did was not okay. \n\nAt the same time, I want to share that I grew up with parents who loved to punish me (and not for racism) by prohibiting me from attending events (the freshman dance was one of many) and I was never able to socially recover from it throughout my childhood and young adult life. I wasn\u2019t around enough in those early high school years to make solid friendships and keep the ones I already had. A huge part of high school girl friendships is physical presence and being around IRL. \n\nSo no you\u2019re not an AH and maybe you keep her home from this one event, but please be cautious going forward about this being the form of punishment. It never taught me anything but that my parents didn\u2019t care about my social integration.", "NTA. Sit down with your daughter.

Missing one freshmen event is getting off easy compared to the fallout of being harrassed oblibe and IRL.", "NTA and the fact your daughter thinks \"its not a big deal\" cements that answer, she is racist, she deserves the punishments, and she needs to know how much her words can affect other people.

Stick to your guns, sounds like you are teaching her the right way to view other cultures.", "Your daughter *still* thinks racism isn't a big deal.  Do not let her go to this dance unless you want to teach her that she's right and racism *isn't* a big deal.  \n\nYou've got less than 4 years to prepare her for the adult world. Don't fail her by letting her grow up to he a crummy person. \n\nNTA. Punishment stops when a lesson is learned or no lesson gets learned", "NTA\n\nHer actions definitely rate the consequences.", "NTA but serious issues ahead.  Your daughter sounds like a bully, at least what her friends and her did constitutes that behaviour.  Great to teach her about China but that racism might run much deeper and you should let her know the dance is only one of many things she'll be missing till she smartens up!", "The minute she said you don't understand your autistic. I would have lost my mind and grounded her until she was 18 years old.", "You are definitely right to take this seriously.  The punishment is far from unfair.  Missing one dance due to bad behavior, and being taken to a couple of museums is not a big deal.  \n\nYou could also talk to her about how she was willing to ruin Paxton's social life by being racist to his friends, and that if you didn't do anything, it would be being biased towards her.  She is really not being a very nice person, and she and her friends need to understand that before it's too late. \n\nHave you asked her what she thinks a fair punishment might be?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAny form of racism and discrimination should never be tolerated and be punished. \n\nNot allowing her going to dance will hopefully teach her that actions/words have serious consequences. \n\nI also would worry about her comment about you not being able to make decisions and understand since you\u2019re autistic. When in fact this was a decision made by you, your wife, and her friends parents. That also maybe another issue too because if she is racist and discriminating against one group of people then there is a high chance she might be doing it to others. \n\nThis punishment may not completely help her learn that such behavior is unacceptable since you don\u2019t know the source of this behavior. My money is on the school since your daughter and her friends go to the same school and by the sound of the post you, your wife, and friends parents this behavior didn\u2019t come from y\u2019all. \n\nYou need to find the source and remove it immediately even if it means pulling her out of that school, cutting contact with her friends, or whatever. \n\nShe\u2019s lucky with the punishment she got because if my parents ever heard me or my sibling say such things to anyone even to this day - god help me or my siblings. \n\nAlso, shouldn\u2019t be asking if your coworkers if the punishment you gave for your daughter being a racist is fair. You are the parent not them.

If she's doubling down on it not being a big deal and building on that, it might be time to bring in a third party that can actually work through this with you. Be deliberate about who you choose as this will require emotional labor on their part and you want to pick someone that is actually equipped to handle this situation.   \nIt is good to see that the parents are seemingly on the same page.

Or have you told your daughter yourself that you have trouble understanding her because of your autism?\n\n\nI'd say the punishment fits this fine and you're on the right track with discipline so far.

Her underlying personality is going to remain the same, and she will likely continue, just being very careful about being caught.  \n\nHonestly, forcing her to miss the dance, plus some time away from those friends as well as her phone/social media apps is a decent option and likely going to have a bigger effect.  She's also trying to manipulate you with your autism, which is rather concerning too.", "Nta", "NTA. I would make her feel the same way she made those children feel. Pick on her looks and see how she likes it. Racism needs to be destroyed.", "Actually, you might the asshole for naming your kinds Jaxson and Lakelyn.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter was a being a racist bully, which is unacceptable at anytime but especially now when there's been a rise in anti-Asian racism. As an Asian-American, I applaud your efforts to correct the behavior now before it becomes a real problem.", "NTA . You and your wife did well.  Lakelyn will get over it.

Because the older she gets, the worse the consequences will be.", "NTA. And she owes you an apology for the autistic comment as well.

This is what happens when you name your child Lakelyn...", "If I were the parent, I would first have a talk with my child. Sometimes kids say inappropriate things when they are with a group. I do like your idea of taking the girls to the Asian history museums, but I think that rather than not allowing them to attend the freshman dance, I would let them off this once and carefully monitor their behaviour. A drastic punishment could breed resentment and what you what to teach is kindness and understanding. Maybe hold a party for both of your girls' friends?", "NTA\n\nAlso: r/tragedeigh", "YTA just for those names. Please tell me they are made up. N T A if those names aren't real", "NTA. I\u2019m pretty sure her high school doesn\u2019t want racists at the freshman dance.", "NTA\n\nNot only is your daughter racist, she also thinks you're easy to manipulate and stupid because you're Autistic.\n\nSo you might want to tack on something involving education about neurodivergence in history.", "We chose schools based on our kid's personalities and which ones best suited them, we looked at all different models of education for both kid (traditional, Waldorf, Montessori, ect). Lakelyn does better in the more traditional model, while Paxton's school is based off one of the more \"progressive\" models of education (Reggio Emilia).", "Yup, 14 and engaging in manipulative behavior and targeted racism as a group?

Your daughter shared incredibly racist views. And recorded said views. She\u2019s lucky she\u2019s only missing the dance and not ruining her whole future . The more she claims it\u2019s not a big deal the more consequences I would add.", "NTA.  You're trying to raise non racists.  It is a big deal.  What if that video got posted on social media, and followed your daughter around forever?  Actions have consequences.", "True, but the whole situation to me points to something deeper. I would agree if the daughter said \u201cyou have autism you wouldn\u2019t understand why I argued with the teacher\u201d but to use it as a defense against being held responsible for some pretty pointed racism in person to a child speaks to her using it not misunderstanding it", "Yep, I remember that one too! I don't have links for the others, but the earliest versions I remember featured a daughter who was homophobic towards the popular son's gay friend. And then the OP pivoted to writing stories about a daughter who was ableist towards the popular son's autistic friend. Now I guess they've switched it up again and are writing stories about a racist daughter?

This could easily nuke her future.  And if not changed asap could easily suck her down a very dark path.", "THIS!! if you can't get her to understand why what she was wrong and could harm others...take the me me me approach.

If it is in her social media Archives it could cost her a job, college admission etc in the future.", "Yes, it's similar, but different.

I am not saying what she said was right because it's not but you chose to put her in a primarily white school and unfortunately the other students have rubbed off on her. It was your choice to put your children in different schools so the fact that they have different types of friends and thoughts are on you. But she does need to be punished for what she said but remember our children learn from their peers. So maybe put her in a different school with a better mix if you really want her to change. That's what we did with our son and it was a big improvement", ">Read what you post you go on about all your son does and only talk about what your daughter did wrong.\n\nYes, because that's what happened. The daughter did something wrong. That's the story being told here.", "But you never say anything good about your daughter so it comes across as you don't like her. Like your son is perfect and your daughter is a screw up. Not saying that is how you feel but that is how it comes across.
