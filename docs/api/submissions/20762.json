Then to top it all off they start the waterworks to attempt to guilt you into it.\n\nIt sucks but this is the hill I'd die on. They're literally attempting to take your house from you.", "NTA text them in your own house to use the kitchen. Jenna don't know how bad she just messed them up. Your son needs to gain his ability to speak asap. Their demands were ridiculous. They truly looked like they were taking advantage and pushing.", "op=NTA\n\nby the title I was so ready to blast you but SERIOUSLY???\n\nthey want you to ask permission to be in your own kitchen?  You have to give up half your house(upstairs) because they don't want you to be around their child for two months?\n\nDo they thinking the screaming cries of a newborn won't affect your sleep for those first two months?", "NTA. That\u2019s hilarious you should laugh. Entitled little shits. Wait until they figure out what parenting means and don\u2019t have a free babysitter. Let them pound sand for the first couple years it\u2019s good for them", "NTA. You are extremely generous and patient! And they are ridiculous and, sadly, taking advantage of your generosity. It sounds like they need a real world wake-up call.", "NTA. Their demands are unreasonable. And you are right they are trying to use that grandchild against you to get their way. They have lived rent free for 3 years they should have enough money saved to afford a room somewhere else. Best of luck", "NTA. I was prepared for something completely different, but they essentially want to hold you hostage in your own home. You need to start dictating some rules, such as if they want space, they move out.", "NTA, they'll come crawling back. Stand firm on using your whole house, of course... and as for \"not seeing the baby for two months\"? Believe me, they'll be BEGGING for someone to take care of the baby after the first week of interrupted sleep.", "NTA \n\nEven if you had gone along with their request, they'd be demanding you take care of the baby within a week because they sound completely insane and likely try to draft you into be the baby's caretaker as soon as they were a tiny bit sleep deprived.", "NTA.\n\nThis is one of those posts where I have a gut reaction to the title, then totally change my judgement upon reading the details.  What they are demanding of you is absurd.", "Woooow!  No, definitly NTA.  They have some real balls, but lack brains.  They are getting a free ride, and think they can control your movements in your own home?  Nope.  Not a chance.  Either they get over themselves, or they can get the hell out.", "If I were OP I\u2019d be waiting outside my lawyers office when it opens the next day to write that nasty entitled piece of s#&@ son out of my will asap.", "NTA. Their proposal was laughable. I laughed too.", "NTA, this is your house and you are doing them a favor. I am sorry they are using your grandbaby as a pawn. I am far to familiar with this. My sister used her kids as a pawn to always get their way.", "No. They can not make rules for you in your house.", "Big NTA. I came in here anticipating to feel a certain way, because there are few instances where someone can disrespect the boundaries of a DiL, laugh in her face and not be the asshole. \n\nLo and behold you had one of those exact rare instances. Her request to you in your own home is absolutely insane! \n\nMaybe, mayyybeeee, pregnancy brain is affecting her hardcore and she\u2019s not thinking rationally. But that\u2019s no excuse for your son to act this way. Good luck, OP. I hope everything turns out well because if they really plan to weaponize their child like this, he/she is in for a bad childhood.", "You are definitely NTA. \nThis is insane and delusional. \nI\u2019m sorry this is happening.", "NTA. \n\n'Please don't visit us shortly after our baby is born' is a reasonable request. 'Please pretend that half your house doesn't exist, and don't use your kitchen unless we OK it, for two months after our baby is born' is ridiculous.", "NTA!!!!! \nThey want to have adult privileges like living together and having a baby then they need to accept their adult responsibilities. Period. No exceptions.", "NTA but you should be prepared to show that email in case they try to turn ppl against you", "LOL NTA. How entitled do they have to be to try to forbid you from going to any part of YOUR house? Sooner or later they\u2019ll come crawling back asking for a place to stay again. Say no and ignore their attempts to guilt you.", "NTA that is laughable", "NTA and I\u2019m proud of you for laughing at their request", "Nta, my goodness, they are staying rent free, you are cleaning and doing their laundry etc. What do these leaches do? I'm sorry, you are doing too much and enabling the situation. They are in no way ready to be parents the way they are acting. They need to move out and deal with their own chores. You have gone above and beyond to deal with these selfish aholes.", "NTA. \n\nFor the first part of it I was ready to be like \u201cyeah obviously you\u2019re the problem\u201d, but this is a laughable request. I\u2019d honestly have laughed and thought they were joking. They live in YOUR home. Asking you to live in the basement and let them take over the rest of the house is just ridiculous. I don\u2019t see how anyone could think that was a rational, serious request. \n\nI understand the importance of setting normal boundaries even though they live in your house like \u201cdon\u2019t come and grab baby out of our/their room in the middle of the night while we are asleep because you wanted snuggles, don\u2019t try to dictate parenting style, etc\u201d. It is also perfectly acceptable to ask people not to visit and see the baby for 2 months IF THEY ARENT LIVING IN YOUR HOME. This is not in any way a rational request.", "NTA, stand your ground. You\u2019ve given them an offer that is more than they deserve, and they\u2019re biting that hand that feeds and resorting to emotional blackmail to justify it. What they\u2019ve pitched is so ridiculous I legitimately snorted. You get confined to one room of the house you\u2019re paying to live in, while what do they contribute, a baby you get to see eventually so long as you do all the laundry and avoid looking at it directly in case you taint it with your unworthy attention?\n\nMaybe a hotel bill is the start of a reality check they need \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Hell what did they expect?\n\nThey live rent free in your house. Have they even said thank you for letting them live there?\n\nThe entitlement of these people. You have to ask when you use your own kitchen.  \n\nNo thank you.", "The title almost had me there! I read it and thought well that\u2019s rude. THEN I read the rest and I\u2019m mind blown. \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA! They are being ridiculous. You should not have to move into the guest room, and also get permission to use your own kitchen. They are being entitled and I would have 100% laughed at them too. \n\nI get wanting some peace, or privacy after giving birth. It\u2019s a really emotional and tiring time, but they cannot expect someone whose home they\u2019re GUESTS in, to make themselves scarce. If they want privacy, they can shut the bedroom door. It\u2019s as simple as that. Holding the baby over your head, like a pawn in a game to try and make you give in to their whims is awful behaviour.", "Obviously, NTA. I just want to say that I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself and not catering to their emotional blackmail. I read so many posts where some new parents go a little too far with their demands and (successfully) use a relationship with the baby as leverage. They'll be back.", "NTA!!\n\nThis is hysterical Princess behaviour from your daughter in law and AH behaviour from your son. \n\nThey\u2019ve talked about their \u201cboundaries\u201d (I think they meant entitlements) but you\u2019ve affirmed your own boundaries, well done!", "NTA. Their plan was to put you on house arrest \nand sequester you in the guest room. In your own home.   Where they lived rent free.", "NTA\n\nYou are the one with the right to set limits to protect your safety, privacy, comfort and autonomy in your home. You decide which areas are common are which are private. You decide when, if, and for how long visitors or tenants are welcome. \n\nYour DIL is confusing boundaries- the limits she sets for where she focuses her time, energy and resources, for dictating changes in your behavior. She has no right or power to dictate to you, take over rule in your home, and banish you. \n\nIf she wants to keep baby away from outsiders the first few months, great. Everyone in your house is \"in the bubble.\" If she wants a smaller bubble, she has her private space in your home. She can spend her days in their bedroom if she doesn't want contact with the others who live there.\n\nSometimes first time parents go a little crazy, and think being a parent gives them control over everywhere the world touches their child. That seems to be DILs problem.", "NTA", "NTA. Holy shit, when did kids become so entitled????? Sorry but they are absolute children. And they\u2019re both spoiled brats. How DARE she think she can speak to you that way? YOU\u2019RE ruining THEIR magical moment? They can just pack their bags and find somewhere else to stay then. What happened to being thankful and respectful? Please stick to your guns and absolutely do not give in to this nonsense! Humans should not treat each other this way.", "Definitely NTA!! That whole thing is absolutely unreal!", "NTA - Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. You should cross post this under Entitled People.", "From the title I was expecting a completely different situation but no, absolutely NTA! Honestly it's not even about you respecting their boundaries, but them respecting yours! In your own home! Where you cook and clean and let them live for free!!\n\nIf they needed their own apartment they should have gotten their own apartment. And if they can't afford an apartment then they should have waited before having the baby in the first place!", "NTA !!!", "NTA.  They're being unrealistic.", "NTA. They live in your house. It\u2019s ok to ask people outside the home to give them space, but you live there and have been extremely generous to help them out as they are struggling with money right now. I understand new parents being cautious with their baby, but this is going too far. \nHow dare they call you heartless when you have lovingly opened your home to them!", "NTA. It\u2019s best that they move out and get their own place if they privacy throughout YOUR home.", "NTA. Wow they sounds like two spoiled brats. Let them figure it out on their own how to survive with a baby. If they don\u2019t come crying back to you they will find someone. Save that email for evidence. I guarantee they will twist the story and make you out to be the bad person.", "Make them pay rent and you\u2019re still NTA.", "NTA. Based on the title I was expecting to call you the AH, but their request is ridiculous. I am sorry they are using your grandchild to extort you, that is not cool at all. Please stick to your rules. Hopefully they will realize that they are wrong and come apologize.", "NTA. In any other situation I would say the \u201cplease don\u2019t visit for two months\u201d type thing would make sense. Parenting, as a lot of us know, can be super overwhelming and a flow of people doesn\u2019t necessarily help the stress. But they\u2019re living in your home expense free, and demanding you make those changes and expect you to act like you\u2019re the guest in your own home?

Good on you for showing them the function of an exterior door.  Perhaps they'll learn respect.  Perhaps.", "NTA\n\nIf they lived in their own home,  that'd be another story.  They lose all rights to privacy when they stayed in your home WITHOUT PAYING RENT. \n\nNope. That ain't it.

Those aren't boundaries, those are demands.", "NTA\n\nI was expecting something totally different than your son thinking he could take over YOUR house just because he's having a baby.\n\nLet them leave. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f is still your house and you don't need permission to use your own kitchen.

So NTA", "At no point did I expect the next turn in this story. NTA.", "I honestly can not believe this is real. Is there grandparents rights in your country? NTA", "NTA. Good lord these two are real pieces of work. You said it perfectly, they are using this baby to try and get you to do what they want. Let them stay gone, they clearly are in desperate need of a reality check.", "This makes me laugh because son and DIL sound so clueless that they have no idea how difficult being first time parents can be, especially at such a young age.  Chances are once the baby is born they would be begging OP to help out as much as she can.  Never ever bite the hand that feeds you, especially when you\u2019ve got no hands to spare.", "NTa. They are old enough. Time to figure it out life for themselves", "NTA. I would've laughed, too.", "NTA yeah they have lost their minds. They are living in your house rent free, they don\u2019t get to decide how you move in your home. These need a wake up call. Why can\u2019t they stay with her family?", "NTA. It sounds like you dodged a bullet. Hopefully they won't come back.", "NTA. I do wonder if they've been influenced by the many threads/forums that talk about the importance of new parents setting boundaries and bonding with their new baby. But the massive difference here is that they are guests in your home - they need to fit in with how you want to live, not the other way around.", "\"We are bulldozing our way in, completely taking over and we demand that you RESPECT OUR BOUNDARIESSSSS!!!\" Nope. They can go crash somebody else's home. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like there is a perfectly good guest room downstairs that *they* can move into (with your permission) to have their privacy and 'boundaries' for as long as they'd like. This isn't their home, they get to dictate nothing. And you've been very generous and supportive and helpful and cooperative and have sacrificed for their benefit. It's not like you have not shown support and respect for their situation. They are acting extremely entitled. Don't let them guilt you.", "NTA.  But why couldn\u2019t you see the baby for two months.  That is ridiculous   They are acting like some celebrities or royals who protect their baby against paparazzi. And they send out an email this is so crazy do people  really do this. If somebody when send me such a dumb request unwound most defenitily laugh in their face. You should be happy I wanna see your baby in the first place and bring a gift and every thing.  In top of that they want to take over your house the entitlement is real over her \nThey are delusional you handle this very good", "NTA, and that took a turn I wasn\u2019t expecting from the title.

Now they want you to live in the basement with no kitchen so they can play dress ups and happy families. \n\nYeah. They have some growing up to do", "NTA. They cray-cray. (Do people still say that? I'm old so....)", "Nope. You\u2019re not the asshole.", "Where is this pregnancy/new baby entitlement coming from? Wow! OP, you are definitely NTA, but the soon-to-be parents are! The poor baby. I hope you are around a lot to balance out the craziness of the parents. Good luck on this journey!", "NTA. I was fully prepared to call you the AH before I read this. They are living in a delusional fantasy land if they think any of those stipulations are reasonable in your own home they live in for free. They need to wake up and smell reality or go sponge off someone else. Three years living rent free should allow them to purchase the equivalent of a small castle to spend their time alone in.", "NTA.  You were right to laugh, anyone would think thats a joke.  Theyre crazy to think you would go for that.   \n\n\nAlso i would probably inform your other family members about what happened before they start going around and lying about you.   Get ahead of that by just telling the truth.", "Hi OP!\n\nI think your son and his S.O. are young and inexperienced parents and that's why they have the boundaries they do. They don't know yet what they need/don't need from ppl after having a baby.\n\nIt is likely they will change their minds on some stuff.\n\n8 Months is pretty far along and they are probably scared and overwhelmed so I wouldn't push anything too hard but gently let them know that You will accommodate their boundaries within reason but as the homeowner and financial provider for their family you do not expect to be too restricted in your home. That doesn't mean you  are going to crowd them but you will remain on the first floor in your original bedroom.\n\nhopefully things work out and go well. Congrats on becoming a grandmother, I hope son and daughter in law come around soon!", "Ridiculously NTA. She's completely delusional as is your son", "NTA.  Good riddance to bad garbage.  I\u2019m sorry that they are so greedy", "NTA. It\u2019s insane that they expect to be able to limit where and when you go in your own home.

They can put the expectation on others but not on someone living in the house.", "NTA!\n\nHoly fuck they sound insane", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous to ask you in your home to have a planned schedule when you can use the kitchen, not go up stairs, etc. they were super disrespectful to you in your own home", "Oooh I gotta say as a 35 week pregnant lady I was prepared to say YTA. but not at all. They live with you and you've paid for almost everything? NTA", "I am so curious to hear the reaction of your other children.

That you've allowed them to stay in until they can get themselves on their feet. \n\nLike, in your actual home that you all share together. \n\nAnd they expect you to literally stay away from them for 2 whole months!? That is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nThen to go on and become so irrate about it, they come off as incredibly entitled and honestly ungrateful. \n\nI had a similar rule, not two months, but that I didn't want visitors right away and probably after a few weeks I would allow some people to come. I would never have expected the same rules to apply were I to live with a person. That is beyond comprehension. \n\nYou are NTA, not even close.", "Wtf you\u2019re definitely NTA. I am so sorry for whatever your future holds with these two clowns if they keep this  attitude up.", "NTA. This \u201cdon\u2019t see my new baby for a period of time\u201d is kind of a new thing?

I laughed too when I read their \"boundaries.\"  Some people have to learn the hard lessons of being grateful and making sacrifices for your own immediate family.

Your sons wife is gonna come crawling on her hands and knees when she hasn't slept in 2 weeks and is more tired than she's ever been in her life.  Assuming, of course, you let them back in. Momma, I'm urging to get a rental agreement signed that is enforceable by law. Don't let these entitled people back in your home without one.
