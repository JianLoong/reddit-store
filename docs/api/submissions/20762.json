Then to top it all off they start the waterworks to attempt to guilt you into it.\n\nIt sucks but this is the hill I'd die on. They're literally attempting to take your house from you.", "NTA text them in your own house to use the kitchen. Jenna don't know how bad she just messed them up. Your son needs to gain his ability to speak asap. Their demands were ridiculous. They truly looked like they were taking advantage and pushing.", "op=NTA\n\nby the title I was so ready to blast you but SERIOUSLY???\n\nthey want you to ask permission to be in your own kitchen?  You have to give up half your house(upstairs) because they don't want you to be around their child for two months?\n\nDo they thinking the screaming cries of a newborn won't affect your sleep for those first two months?", "NTA. That\u2019s hilarious you should laugh. Entitled little shits. Wait until they figure out what parenting means and don\u2019t have a free babysitter. Let them pound sand for the first couple years it\u2019s good for them", "NTA. You are extremely generous and patient! And they are ridiculous and, sadly, taking advantage of your generosity. It sounds like they need a real world wake-up call.", "NTA. Their demands are unreasonable. And you are right they are trying to use that grandchild against you to get their way. They have lived rent free for 3 years they should have enough money saved to afford a room somewhere else. Best of luck", "NTA. I was prepared for something completely different, but they essentially want to hold you hostage in your own home. You need to start dictating some rules, such as if they want space, they move out.", "NTA, they'll come crawling back. Stand firm on using your whole house, of course... and as for \"not seeing the baby for two months\"? Believe me, they'll be BEGGING for someone to take care of the baby after the first week of interrupted sleep.", "NTA \n\nEven if you had gone along with their request, they'd be demanding you take care of the baby within a week because they sound completely insane and likely try to draft you into be the baby's caretaker as soon as they were a tiny bit sleep deprived.", "NTA.\n\nThis is one of those posts where I have a gut reaction to the title, then totally change my judgement upon reading the details.  What they are demanding of you is absurd.", "Woooow!  No, definitly NTA.  They have some real balls, but lack brains.  They are getting a free ride, and think they can control your movements in your own home?  Nope.  Not a chance.  Either they get over themselves, or they can get the hell out.", "If I were OP I\u2019d be waiting outside my lawyers office when it opens the next day to write that nasty entitled piece of s#&@ son out of my will asap.", "NTA. Their proposal was laughable. I laughed too.", "NTA, this is your house and you are doing them a favor. I am sorry they are using your grandbaby as a pawn. I am far to familiar with this. My sister used her kids as a pawn to always get their way.", "No. They can not make rules for you in your house.", "Big NTA. I came in here anticipating to feel a certain way, because there are few instances where someone can disrespect the boundaries of a DiL, laugh in her face and not be the asshole. \n\nLo and behold you had one of those exact rare instances. Her request to you in your own home is absolutely insane! \n\nMaybe, mayyybeeee, pregnancy brain is affecting her hardcore and she\u2019s not thinking rationally. But that\u2019s no excuse for your son to act this way. Good luck, OP. I hope everything turns out well because if they really plan to weaponize their child like this, he/she is in for a bad childhood.", "You are definitely NTA. \nThis is insane and delusional. \nI\u2019m sorry this is happening.", "NTA. \n\n'Please don't visit us shortly after our baby is born' is a reasonable request. 'Please pretend that half your house doesn't exist, and don't use your kitchen unless we OK it, for two months after our baby is born' is ridiculous.", "NTA!!!!! \nThey want to have adult privileges like living together and having a baby then they need to accept their adult responsibilities. Period. No exceptions.", "NTA but you should be prepared to show that email in case they try to turn ppl against you", "LOL NTA. How entitled do they have to be to try to forbid you from going to any part of YOUR house? Sooner or later they\u2019ll come crawling back asking for a place to stay again. Say no and ignore their attempts to guilt you.", "NTA that is laughable", "NTA and I\u2019m proud of you for laughing at their request", "Nta, my goodness, they are staying rent free, you are cleaning and doing their laundry etc. What do these leaches do? I'm sorry, you are doing too much and enabling the situation. They are in no way ready to be parents the way they are acting. They need to move out and deal with their own chores. You have gone above and beyond to deal with these selfish aholes.", "NTA. \n\nFor the first part of it I was ready to be like \u201cyeah obviously you\u2019re the problem\u201d, but this is a laughable request. I\u2019d honestly have laughed and thought they were joking. They live in YOUR home. Asking you to live in the basement and let them take over the rest of the house is just ridiculous. I don\u2019t see how anyone could think that was a rational, serious request. \n\nI understand the importance of setting normal boundaries even though they live in your house like \u201cdon\u2019t come and grab baby out of our/their room in the middle of the night while we are asleep because you wanted snuggles, don\u2019t try to dictate parenting style, etc\u201d. It is also perfectly acceptable to ask people not to visit and see the baby for 2 months IF THEY ARENT LIVING IN YOUR HOME. This is not in any way a rational request.", "NTA, stand your ground. You\u2019ve given them an offer that is more than they deserve, and they\u2019re biting that hand that feeds and resorting to emotional blackmail to justify it. What they\u2019ve pitched is so ridiculous I legitimately snorted. You get confined to one room of the house you\u2019re paying to live in, while what do they contribute, a baby you get to see eventually so long as you do all the laundry and avoid looking at it directly in case you taint it with your unworthy attention?\n\nMaybe a hotel bill is the start of a reality check they need \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Hell what did they expect?\n\nThey live rent free in your house. Have they even said thank you for letting them live there?\n\nThe entitlement of these people. You have to ask when you use your own kitchen.  \n\nNo thank you.", "The title almost had me there! I read it and thought well that\u2019s rude. THEN I read the rest and I\u2019m mind blown. \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA! They are being ridiculous. You should not have to move into the guest room, and also get permission to use your own kitchen. They are being entitled and I would have 100% laughed at them too. \n\nI get wanting some peace, or privacy after giving birth. It\u2019s a really emotional and tiring time, but they cannot expect someone whose home they\u2019re GUESTS in, to make themselves scarce. If they want privacy, they can shut the bedroom door. It\u2019s as simple as that. Holding the baby over your head, like a pawn in a game to try and make you give in to their whims is awful behaviour.", "Obviously, NTA. I just want to say that I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself and not catering to their emotional blackmail. I read so many posts where some new parents go a little too far with their demands and (successfully) use a relationship with the baby as leverage. They'll be back.", "NTA!!\n\nThis is hysterical Princess behaviour from your daughter in law and AH behaviour from your son. \n\nThey\u2019ve talked about their \u201cboundaries\u201d (I think they meant entitlements) but you\u2019ve affirmed your own boundaries, well done!", "NTA. Their plan was to put you on house arrest \nand sequester you in the guest room. In your own home.   Where they lived rent free.", "NTA\n\nYou are the one with the right to set limits to protect your safety, privacy, comfort and autonomy in your home. You decide which areas are common are which are private. You decide when, if, and for how long visitors or tenants are welcome. \n\nYour DIL is confusing boundaries- the limits she sets for where she focuses her time, energy and resources, for dictating changes in your behavior. She has no right or power to dictate to you, take over rule in your home, and banish you. \n\nIf she wants to keep baby away from outsiders the first few months, great. Everyone in your house is \"in the bubble.\" If she wants a smaller bubble, she has her private space in your home. She can spend her days in their bedroom if she doesn't want contact with the others who live there.\n\nSometimes first time parents go a little crazy, and think being a parent gives them control over everywhere the world touches their child. That seems to be DILs problem.", "NTA", "NTA. Holy shit, when did kids become so entitled????? Sorry but they are absolute children. And they\u2019re both spoiled brats. How DARE she think she can speak to you that way? YOU\u2019RE ruining THEIR magical moment? They can just pack their bags and find somewhere else to stay then. What happened to being thankful and respectful? Please stick to your guns and absolutely do not give in to this nonsense! Humans should not treat each other this way.", "Definitely NTA!! That whole thing is absolutely unreal!", "NTA - Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. You should cross post this under Entitled People.", "From the title I was expecting a completely different situation but no, absolutely NTA! Honestly it's not even about you respecting their boundaries, but them respecting yours! In your own home! Where you cook and clean and let them live for free!!\n\nIf they needed their own apartment they should have gotten their own apartment. And if they can't afford an apartment then they should have waited before having the baby in the first place!", "NTA !!!", "NTA.  They're being unrealistic.", "NTA. They live in your house. It\u2019s ok to ask people outside the home to give them space, but you live there and have been extremely generous to help them out as they are struggling with money right now. I understand new parents being cautious with their baby, but this is going too far. \nHow dare they call you heartless when you have lovingly opened your home to them!", "NTA. It\u2019s best that they move out and get their own place if they privacy throughout YOUR home.", "NTA. Wow they sounds like two spoiled brats. Let them figure it out on their own how to survive with a baby. If they don\u2019t come crying back to you they will find someone. Save that email for evidence. I guarantee they will twist the story and make you out to be the bad person.", "Make them pay rent and you\u2019re still NTA.", "NTA. Based on the title I was expecting to call you the AH, but their request is ridiculous. I am sorry they are using your grandchild to extort you, that is not cool at all. Please stick to your rules. Hopefully they will realize that they are wrong and come apologize.", "NTA. In any other situation I would say the \u201cplease don\u2019t visit for two months\u201d type thing would make sense. Parenting, as a lot of us know, can be super overwhelming and a flow of people doesn\u2019t necessarily help the stress. But they\u2019re living in your home expense free, and demanding you make those changes and expect you to act like you\u2019re the guest in your own home?

Good on you for showing them the function of an exterior door.  Perhaps they'll learn respect.  Perhaps.", "NTA\n\nIf they lived in their own home,  that'd be another story.  They lose all rights to privacy when they stayed in your home WITHOUT PAYING RENT. \n\nNope. That ain't it.

Those aren't boundaries, those are demands.", "NTA\n\nI was expecting something totally different than your son thinking he could take over YOUR house just because he's having a baby.\n\nLet them leave. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f is still your house and you don't need permission to use your own kitchen.

So NTA", "At no point did I expect the next turn in this story. NTA.", "I honestly can not believe this is real. Is there grandparents rights in your country? NTA", "NTA. Good lord these two are real pieces of work. You said it perfectly, they are using this baby to try and get you to do what they want. Let them stay gone, they clearly are in desperate need of a reality check.", "This makes me laugh because son and DIL sound so clueless that they have no idea how difficult being first time parents can be, especially at such a young age.  Chances are once the baby is born they would be begging OP to help out as much as she can.  Never ever bite the hand that feeds you, especially when you\u2019ve got no hands to spare.", "NTa. They are old enough. Time to figure it out life for themselves", "NTA. I would've laughed, too.", "NTA yeah they have lost their minds. They are living in your house rent free, they don\u2019t get to decide how you move in your home. These need a wake up call. Why can\u2019t they stay with her family?", "NTA. It sounds like you dodged a bullet. Hopefully they won't come back.", "NTA. I do wonder if they've been influenced by the many threads/forums that talk about the importance of new parents setting boundaries and bonding with their new baby. But the massive difference here is that they are guests in your home - they need to fit in with how you want to live, not the other way around.", "\"We are bulldozing our way in, completely taking over and we demand that you RESPECT OUR BOUNDARIESSSSS!!!\" Nope. They can go crash somebody else's home. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like there is a perfectly good guest room downstairs that *they* can move into (with your permission) to have their privacy and 'boundaries' for as long as they'd like. This isn't their home, they get to dictate nothing. And you've been very generous and supportive and helpful and cooperative and have sacrificed for their benefit. It's not like you have not shown support and respect for their situation. They are acting extremely entitled. Don't let them guilt you.", "NTA.  But why couldn\u2019t you see the baby for two months.  That is ridiculous   They are acting like some celebrities or royals who protect their baby against paparazzi. And they send out an email this is so crazy do people  really do this. If somebody when send me such a dumb request unwound most defenitily laugh in their face. You should be happy I wanna see your baby in the first place and bring a gift and every thing.  In top of that they want to take over your house the entitlement is real over her \nThey are delusional you handle this very good", "NTA, and that took a turn I wasn\u2019t expecting from the title.

Now they want you to live in the basement with no kitchen so they can play dress ups and happy families. \n\nYeah. They have some growing up to do", "NTA. They cray-cray. (Do people still say that? I'm old so....)", "Nope. You\u2019re not the asshole.", "Where is this pregnancy/new baby entitlement coming from? Wow! OP, you are definitely NTA, but the soon-to-be parents are! The poor baby. I hope you are around a lot to balance out the craziness of the parents. Good luck on this journey!", "NTA. I was fully prepared to call you the AH before I read this. They are living in a delusional fantasy land if they think any of those stipulations are reasonable in your own home they live in for free. They need to wake up and smell reality or go sponge off someone else. Three years living rent free should allow them to purchase the equivalent of a small castle to spend their time alone in.", "NTA.  You were right to laugh, anyone would think thats a joke.  Theyre crazy to think you would go for that.   \n\n\nAlso i would probably inform your other family members about what happened before they start going around and lying about you.   Get ahead of that by just telling the truth.", "Hi OP!\n\nI think your son and his S.O. are young and inexperienced parents and that's why they have the boundaries they do. They don't know yet what they need/don't need from ppl after having a baby.\n\nIt is likely they will change their minds on some stuff.\n\n8 Months is pretty far along and they are probably scared and overwhelmed so I wouldn't push anything too hard but gently let them know that You will accommodate their boundaries within reason but as the homeowner and financial provider for their family you do not expect to be too restricted in your home. That doesn't mean you  are going to crowd them but you will remain on the first floor in your original bedroom.\n\nhopefully things work out and go well. Congrats on becoming a grandmother, I hope son and daughter in law come around soon!", "Ridiculously NTA. She's completely delusional as is your son", "NTA.  Good riddance to bad garbage.  I\u2019m sorry that they are so greedy", "NTA. It\u2019s insane that they expect to be able to limit where and when you go in your own home.

They can put the expectation on others but not on someone living in the house.", "NTA!\n\nHoly fuck they sound insane", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous to ask you in your home to have a planned schedule when you can use the kitchen, not go up stairs, etc. they were super disrespectful to you in your own home", "Oooh I gotta say as a 35 week pregnant lady I was prepared to say YTA. but not at all. They live with you and you've paid for almost everything? NTA", "I am so curious to hear the reaction of your other children.

That you've allowed them to stay in until they can get themselves on their feet. \n\nLike, in your actual home that you all share together. \n\nAnd they expect you to literally stay away from them for 2 whole months!? That is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nThen to go on and become so irrate about it, they come off as incredibly entitled and honestly ungrateful. \n\nI had a similar rule, not two months, but that I didn't want visitors right away and probably after a few weeks I would allow some people to come. I would never have expected the same rules to apply were I to live with a person. That is beyond comprehension. \n\nYou are NTA, not even close.", "Wtf you\u2019re definitely NTA. I am so sorry for whatever your future holds with these two clowns if they keep this  attitude up.", "NTA. This \u201cdon\u2019t see my new baby for a period of time\u201d is kind of a new thing?

I laughed too when I read their \"boundaries.\"  Some people have to learn the hard lessons of being grateful and making sacrifices for your own immediate family.

Your sons wife is gonna come crawling on her hands and knees when she hasn't slept in 2 weeks and is more tired than she's ever been in her life.  Assuming, of course, you let them back in. Momma, I'm urging to get a rental agreement signed that is enforceable by law. Don't let these entitled people back in your home without one.

Normally this kinda title leads into \u201cI have never taken any health precautions in my life, my DIL won\u2019t let me goober all over her fresh out the womb baby\u201d but dammmmnnnn these kids be entitled", "100% for only formula fed babies ;) \n\nMinus the hospital part, it\u2019s not so different from where I am.", "Lol this is the typical reddit person, reads the headline without reading the post.", "I absolutely did not expect to agree with the OP as hard as I do, based on that title.", "They couldn\u2019t, that\u2019s why they e-mailed it.", "Don't forget rent free too", "I have honestly never met someone that didn't have close family in the delivery room. I understand not wanting visitors in your house, but it's a baby, not some secret information. If you live close by, I'd expect you to show up at the hospital. If I *live in your freaking house* I'd probably expect you to be holding hands with the new mom.", "When their sleep deprived asses go begging OP for her help, I hope she just laughs in their faces again", "No way!!\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "These two can't even take care of themselves.  They'd be handing that baby to grandma in under a day.  What ridiculous people.", "AND they emailed the OP from , presumably, a room in her own house,  the list of rules .  Instead of just talking to her at breakfast like a normal\nhuman.", "Yeah, cuz it's so easy to run plumbing and possibly gas anywhere in a house any time. Smfh", "Definitely not Planet I'm-Ready-To-Be-A-Parent", "Same. Maybe they are  just being wombzilla right now. Hope they\u2019ll calm down.", "If she pays those bills I will reach through my screen and give her a good shake.\n\nMy God the absolute entitlement of her son and his SO.", "Yes, this sounds calculated doesn't it?  Keep pushing this woman, suddenly she's the live-in housekeeper in danger of losing her house. It happens.", "They both lived with me for a six weeks before Jenna found out she was pregnant so about 9 and half months", "Same. I read the title and was expecting an overbearing entitled grandparent. I never could have dreamed up something like this.", "I did. A lot of these titles are written like YouTube click bait headlines", "And remodel the upstairs for us.", "I don't know anyone who had family other than their partner in the delivery. Right outside, sure. In the room when the baby came out? I'm sure it happens, but no one I know has talked about doing that.\n\nAt some point the obstetrician is also going to have to tell the crowds to stay outside. There's work to do. Labor, even.", "I can hear their wailing already!  The Real World can be a shock for some, and you instituting some boundaries and conditions is just a slight foreshadowing of reality.  Good Luck!", "I wish you all the best!", "Send him an email/text:\n\n*Hey [Son]. I\u2019m so proud that you have chosen to embrace your personal and financial independence and strike out on your own as an adult. I wish you and [girlfriend] the best. Let me know your new address when you find an apartment. I **promise** not to visit or interfere in any way until you give me permission. Love and kisses, Mom.*\n\nThen change your locks, and enjoy the peace and quiet. Heck, since you know you won\u2019t have to deal with grandma duty until 2 months after the baby is born, take yourself on a nice empty-nester vacation. ;)", "They're being choosy beggars and threatening to not let you see the baby is horrible!", "They are taking advantage of your generosity. My Mom helped me with my son since we brought him home and she lives an hour away. My son is almost 2 years old and she still helps us by taking him over night at least one night almost every week.\n\nI greatly appreciate the help and would never abuse her - I ALWAYS ***ask*** if she wants my son on whatever weekend and do not get upset if she says she has other plans (which almost never happens, but still).\n\nNTA. They'll figure out how lucky they are about a week or two after they have the baby by themselves with no help. They deserve to learn a hard lesson about gratitude, but you can choose how nice you want to be to them.", "Unfortunately, you have totally coddled and catered to your son and DIL's every demand in the past. They are taking advantage of you and are spoiled rotten.", "Using the internet she pays for, no doubt.", "Consider their ages and demands, not two of the brightest light bulbs in the chandelier.", "Right? You could be spending beaucoup bucks modifying a room into a kitchen like that. I was all set to call OP the asshole from the title, but they definitely are not.", "Ya wanna kidnap her with me and take her for a mani/pedi or to lunch? Drinks? Show her how her kid and the SO should be treating her, based off how supportive she is?? Gah. I lost my mom 18 yrs ago. I'd love to have love like hers.", "After reading your post, I can say that my son's long-term girlfriend isn't the worst. I hope that you can find peace in your home. Good luck", "NTA, but they made a baby with no apartment  house or otherwise?  Not the brightness bulbs. I like your rules.", "Pushing your culture on her in your house! Um, yes, that's the point, my dear, welcome to my home where I live my culture! When I go see your house, that you don't have, you can show me your culture.", "Oh my gosh, you are so NTA. \n\nYou are allowed to dictate the (reasonable) rules in your own home. You are entitled to respect and to help around the house, especially since they are not paying for anything. \n\nIt sounds like they want all the perks of being cared for like children and all the respect of being an adult. But those two things cannot exist at the same time. \n\nYou're not doing anything wrong here.", "Your house, your rules.", ">My part I told them a gender reveal party was tacky and a waste of money were they where meant to saving for a home I made my son take extra hours at work I also told my dil that her parents can\u2019t stay at my house for visits they need to go to a hotel because my unmarried daughter stays here sometimes (flight attendant) and I\u2019m a widow so no non related men can stay in my home over night  so i was told I was pushing my culture on to her\n\nI mean, that all sounds pretty reasonable? \n\nI don't see this as you \"pushing your culture\" on her.", "Jesus Christ the DIL sounds like a piece of work. Good luck to her and your son.", "That's not pushing anything at all on them. Please, if they manage to weasel their way back in see an attorney and create a legal agreement. I find this behavior alarming, actually.", "I thought this was a /r/amithedevil post when I saw the title!", "There's kind of a running gag here, where people try to make the heading read as if they're the AH if they think they weren't. This was one of the better done ones.", "agree", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\n\nI am really struggling with the entitlement and audacity. Like who even thinks like this let alone says it and doubles down on it???", "These 2 are definitely NOT the sharpest knives \ud83d\udd2a in the drawer!!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\u2026unless you\u2019re counting knives in the back \ud83d\ude33#2 fools", "Thank God they're making more of themselves!", "You also couldn't do it in two months, in most places. Between just getting on a contractor's schedule, and picking out materials, and waiting for delivery, and having the work done, creating a new kitchen could take up to six.", "And here I am worried and not thrilled because my son picked in his university, based on where his GF was accepted . . .she is looking pretty damn great right now", "It\u2019s not, it\u2019s just DILs attempt at emotional blackmail. Honestly feel sorry for OPs son, he\u2019s gonna have to live with this mess of a human forever now that he\u2019s got her pregnant"]}
