They could literally just keep the baby in a bedroom if they don't want you to see it at first. Expecting you to give up your entire house and ask permission to use certain community rooms is overreaching and entitled.", "NTA  it's your house. If they want privacy and their own space, they need to find another place to live. You don't make the rules when you live rent free in someone else's home", "NTA. You were right to laugh at their rules. Do they think they own the house and you're the tenant living there free? They're delusional!\n\nI think they thought the threat of not being allowed to see your grandchild would get you to agree to anything they wanted. Good for you that it didn't!\n\nAnd no, you're not ruining their magical time for being disrespectful, they are.\n\nMeanwhile, think about what concessions they'd have to make to you in order for you to permit them to move back. They've gotten to feel too entitled to your aid.", "NTA\n\nI was soo ready to go full nuclear y.ta based on your title, but was pleasantly surprised. They are being ridiculously entitled. It's your house. A houseguest doesn't get to dictate where you can spend time in your own home.", "NTA, that's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard, even if they weren't living in your home it would be ridiculous, but since they are literally insane.", "NTA. \n\nThey are living rent free in your home and essentially wanted to keep you from using your own kitchen or common living areas. That is not reasonable. Also, don't give them the things you have purchased. Based on their inability to be reasonable chances are you will either end up with the baby in your care or they will be back soon enough.", "If this is exactly as you portray, it\u2019s an absolutely NTA. You seem to have raised a very spoiled son, who is leading himself be pushed around by his pregnant girlfriend.", "NTA.  They're living rent free in your house and want to restrict you to one room?  And you have to ask permission to use your own kitchen?  Unbelievable!", "NTA - Tell em I laughed with you!!!", "NTA - they sound like idiots", "I'm just staring at this.... NTA obviously I hope they don't expect you to pay for the hotel. \n\nGood luck with this mess!", "At first I was expecting to say yta. But they honestly can't expect you to live your life out of your room in your own house...\nI understand setting boundaries and the not seeing the child is probably them having space from being bombarded by visits when they're getting routine but it doesn't change the entitlement they think they have", "NTA, and frankly, when they come crawling back with their tail between their legs (which they will), you need to be clear on what your boundaries are in order for them to continue living in your house.", "NTA they cant not be serious\n\nIf they don\u2019t want anyone to see baby\u2019s for 2 months then they need their own. \n\nSo do they plan on moving out?", "Not gunna lie that title had me set to call YTA but like\u2026are they drunk? Okay fine, can\u2019t see the baby for two months? Find somewhere else to live for two months. NTA", "NTA", "100% NTA. But it\u2019s time for them to get out and find their own place before delivery \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Definitely NTA. They're allowed to set boundaries regarding who sees their baby and when, but you are allowed to set boundaries for your house guests. They have a right to privacy in the two rooms you've let them use, but claiming an entire floor and telling you can't use your own kitchen without asking their permission is beyond absurd. Hope they like the beach", "NTA. They have no right to restrict your movement in your own home.", "NTA\n\nTime for the boundary-setting to swing the other way. When they beg you to let them return, lay down the rules of the household. Perhaps it\u2019s time for them to contribute to bills.", "INFO: Have there been other conflicts, especially about boundaries, since they've been living with you?\n\nThis still feels like a straightforward NTA, but I think a little more context would be helpful.", "NTA. That was a ridiculous request when they live with you", "NTA.  \n\nThey are nasty, entitled brats.  I suspect when their tiny human is born they\u2019ll be begging for some input from you.", "Honestly so prepared to auto YTA you but they\u2019re out to lunch and need to reassess their expectations. They\u2019re completely unreasonable based upon on the situation they\u2019re living in on your dime", "NTA what so ever \n\nYour header had me thinking you were then I read your story \n\nOMG show them your the front door", "Lmao. They probably have 7 brain cells combined. Who the hell makes absurd demands while living rent free in someone\u2019s house?", "Yta for raising an idiot.", "YTA. Just because you agreed to let them live there rent-free doesn\u2019t mean you own the baby and can do whatever you want.  If the parents don\u2019t want you to see the baby for two months, you\u2019ll have to respect their wishes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

FDIL is delusional! You are extending a massive favour for housing then and they are acting in this entitled way. Your son should be ashamed. NTA", "Nta. You are doing them a massive favor and have given them an extremely generous 3 year plan. They are being ungrateful and rude. You aren't asking for anything crazy, unless you aren't telling us the whole story. Next thing you know they are going to demand money for their own house since you won't follow their idiotic demands. I suggest you just kick them out permanently. It isn't worth the drama and stress in your home.", "NTA. When I read they *physically live there with you* I also burst out laughing at the idea of expecting total privacy in shared spaces. You may have shattered her dream plans, but her dream plans are delusional.", "NTA at all! They are acting very entitled and disrespecting you in your own home.", "NTA. I thought this story was gonna go in a whole different direction, but your DIL and son have some serious reality issues if they believe that you aren't allowed access to the common areas of your house where they are being allowed to live rent free.

Oh my goodness, that is too much! Do they contribute anything to your house? Yea, this is some insane entitlement, and if I were you, I would put a heavy foot down! Do they have other options of places to go? If so I would make it clear they are not taking anything you have purchased out of your home and make the sign a rental agreement if they come back, basically stating what they have access to what what level on cleanliness your expect from them.
