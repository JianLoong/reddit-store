We don\u2019t always get to choose what other give us so freaking out about uncomfortable gifts and curbing anxiety by controlling others is some unhealthy gen z bull crap - but in this instance one of the girls actually suffered mental distress and not being able to tell a family member that you are hurt or about a mental condition is unhealthy. Your cousins mother has no maternal instinct- if it was my kids I would be livid and I would make clear rules. Grandma seem to have some type of power. Next year just make a point of not opening them. If pressured say \u201cI prioritise my cousins mental health and well being\u201d She will look crazy if she pushes on and their mother will be too ashamed to push on.
