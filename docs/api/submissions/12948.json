{"id": 12948, "submission_id": "11z12v9", "title": "AITA For Not Keeping My Stepdaughter After My Wife Died?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (45m) had a stepdaughter \"Lori\" (19f) through my deceased wife \"Mary.\" I met Lori when she was 5 and married her mom when she was 9. During those four years I would say we had a good relationship. I didn't push and tried to get involved in her interests. Then when Lori was 12 puberty started to kick in and she developed an attitude. Normally Mary was the main disciplinary between us but after marriage I was able to take on a more authoritative role and I started exercising it.\n\nShortly after I started putting my foot down Lori would snap back with the \"you're not my dad\" line. It was rough but I tried to be patient and kept trying to maintain a bond without being a push over. When Lori was 13 her dad died and since he wasn't in her life for years Mary and I approached her about adoption and while I was prepared for her to say \"No\", but I didn't expect her to be so hurtful about it.\n\nMary chewed her out about it and I tried to get her to talk about why she felt so negatively towards me but she wouldn't open up. Mary and I tried therapy but Lori complained to the extended family who chewed us out for trying to use therapy as a way to \"force an adoption\" on her so we stopped. Mary unexpectedly got pregnant with twins \"Micheal\" (5m) and \"Michelle\" (5f) and we were very happy while Lori said she wanted nothing to do with them and hated how she was going to hear them cry at night. Again we approached the idea of therapy but Lori refused so we let it be.\n\nUnfortunately Mary was in a car accident and passed away. It was awful, I was a wreck and I had no idea how I was going to do all of this on my own. I tried to be there for Lori too but she would just lash out, said she hated me and wished that it had been me and/or the twins instead. I was done and told my In-Laws to get her and during those weeks that Lori had been gone had been a relief, so when school time was starting up again, I called my In-Laws and said that I wasn't going to pick her up and had plans to move back to my home state to be near my side of the family for support.\n\nSeveral members of Mary's side of the family started hounding me, calling me cruel, and that I was abandoning Lori. I reminded everyone that Lori was the one who wasn't interested in having a relationship and since there was no adoption I had no legal obligation to her. Mary's In-Laws tried to come after me legally but since I wasn't Lori's legal guardian it ended up not going anywhere.\n\nI moved away with the twins and years later I was surprised when Lori reached out to me through social media. After a few weeks of communication I agreed to let her come over to see them. After the four of us spent the day together Lori broke down after the twins went to sleep and told me how hard her life was after I left and asked me how I could abandon her. I reminded her of her past actions and she said that she was just a hurting teen and that I should've been the bigger person as the adult. AITA?  \n\n\nEdit for Info: To answer the questions I've been asked in comments/dms  \n\n\n1. Lori parents were never married and her father never played a consistent/active role in her life. By the time died Lori hadn't seen him in 5 years.\n2. Lori was 15/16 when I sent her to her grandparents.\n3. I was already leaning towards moving back to my home state before I had Lori's grandparents pick her up because I wanted to be near my family for emotional support. \n4. I did re-establish contact with Mary's parents at around Christmas time but it was mostly emailed photos of the twins and when they got a little older I would allow phone calls.\n5. In terms of inheritance I put 25% of Mary's life insurance policy in an account for Lori along with around 30% of the money from our shared savings account and around 30% of Mary's separate savings account. I didn't \"steal\" anything from her and the courts for the most part sided with me.   \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679528072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11z12v9/aita_for_not_keeping_my_stepdaughter_after_my/", "score": 674, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You lost your wife and you have to take care of 2 kids. Lori stood her ground of hating you and wishing you were death instead. She always made clear that she does not accept you as her family. She also would tell you now, that she would hate you if you would have taken her with you to your family. And like you mentioned: You weren't her legal guardian and had to right to decide for her.\n\nWhatever option you would have chosen, she wouldn't have been happy about it. That she lost her dad and her mom, does not make it easier for her to have any positive feelings to anybody.\n\nMaybe you could have communicated this with her better if she wants to return to you. Or trying to stay in contact with her. But both of you were grieving and were not able to handle it in a better way.\n\nYou can offer her to be open for more contact again.

She has been hating you for years - and moreover she hated her siblings. What did she expect?", "Info: what did Lori want to do back then? Did you want to stay with you or live with grandparents/in-laws?", "NAH sorry man this is a difficult situation that would have been a lose-lose situation regardless of what happened. She refused to make any sort of connection with you and you trying to force that would\u2019ve been wrong of you which you realized. She lashed out after both her parents were gone which was expected but she wished death on you and your her half-siblings. You trying to force her to stay with you after that would not have been any better unfortunately. Everyone expecting you to step up and be the bigger man has never been in a situation like yours which is why they can say you are TA when clearly you are not. Best you guys can do now is try to love forward for the sake of your kids with her mother. Therapy would be needed probably but she also needs to make an effort to lend bridges", "Info: How old was she when your wife died? You gave her age as 19, and said your reunion had been \"years later\"?", "INFO: Did Mary\u2019s parents have any contact with their grandchildren after you moved away? Did Lori know her siblings at all?", "I have a hard time believing this story, considering the timeline. Just how long did it take for the family members to come after you in court, before it \"ended up not going anywhere\"?  This is not a quick process. The timeline has some problems.", "INFO: How long did you wait after her dad died to ask her about adoption?", "INFO: how old was Lori when you sent her to her mother's relatives?", "No judgement. You were in a tough spot; for sure. But I would also feel abandoned. I would probably never have reached out to you at all. Don\u2019t blow it this time around.", "NTA, sounds like a very difficult situation for everyone involved. It sounds like you really tried to be there for her but in the end she pushed you away. After all that, why would she have wanted to stay with someone she didn't consider to be her father.\n\nAlso, you said she lashed out at you and your two young children, I don't think it would have been fair to keep her around them so they could be her emotional punching bags.\n\nShe was with her grandparents so she was being cared for by family.", "I'm not going to judge what had to be an extremely difficult decision when everyone was grieving. But YWBTA if you didn't work to reconnect now that she's trying.", "NAH. this is just a situation that\u2019s hard for everyone and there are no winners", "Tough one. NTA. People seem to forget that YOU were mourning too and having such an awful negative presence that kept insinuating that you AND two children should have died. You did what you thought was best and sent her where you thought she\u2019d be happier. You did what\u2019s best for you and unfortunately her way of grieving dad to lash out at the wrong people. Hopefully your doing better not and she can learn from her mistakes.", "From what you wrote there I think NTA. She was a kid and didn\u2019t necessarily know what she was doing but the world doesn\u2019t work like that. In real life you can\u2019t treat people like shit and shun them and expect them to always come back. It\u2019s an unfortunate but important lesson for her to learn. \n\nIf she didn\u2019t have any other family then I\u2019d say YTA but she did so there\u2019s no need for your life to be harder. It wouldn\u2019t have helped her.", "NTA. Reddit is often harsh on stepparents and has extreme double standards. You just can't win as a stepparent. By their definition you have to simultaneously be 'not a real parent' but also provide unconditional love like a parent.\n\nActions have consequences and she pushed away her only living guardian. That's a lesson she had to learn and the same goes for the in-laws on their high horses when it's their turn to take care of her.\n\nGreat job for putting your then-infant twins as the priority. As soon as she verbally threatened their lives you're right to cut her off. Who knows what she could do as a teen and you're just a single parent who can't watch over everything.", "Oofff I\u2019m goin NAH she didn\u2019t want or accept your authority when her mother was alive so why would it be different after she died? I get why you sent her to the in-laws. But I also understand her side that she was just a teenager lashing out and needing love.\n\nFrom what you wrote she wasn\u2019t good with you before the kids were born. I think you did what you could to give yourself and the twins a healthy environment. Lori being hateful and spiteful if she had stayed would not have been a good environment for anyone. \n\nWith the repeated refusal of therapy what could anyone expect?", "NAH I understand where you were coming from when you decided to leave Lori with her grandparents. She put no effort into establishing a close relationship with you and treated you like a punching bag. You offered to get her therapy and she declined so what else could you have done? You aren't a mind reader, how were you supposed to know she actually wanted you in her life when she explicitly stated she wished you and her half siblings died. I can also understand her side of things, most of us have been angsty teens and her adolescence was difficult due to so much loss. I'm sorry this happened to both of you and maybe now your relationship can recover. I would also be careful if she is after you for money. Best of luck.", "NTA, wishing death on you and her siblings\u2026 please. She got what she wanted, and decided oops I don\u2019t like it.", "NTA,\n\nLori made it clear that she hated you and didn\u2019t want anything to do with you.

There was no great option for you but you did the best you could. Had you attempted to keep her and take her to live closer to your family she made it clear that she would have hindered both your and her siblings healing and her resentment at being made to go with you would have prevented her own improvement. The main AHs here are those who kept you from putting her in therapy by convincing you you were doing it for the wrong reasons.", "You handled the adoption all wrong, but keeping Lori after her mother dies and you have 2 littles to look after would be hard. Having her hate you would make it impossible.", "NTA. Lori made it pretty clear how she felt about you in the past. You was just basically giving her what she wanted. And since you didn't adopt her you are right about having no obligations to her. I feel for the girl, though.", "NTA you need a support system too. You raised her then wished death on you and the twins. She got what she wanted, you and the little ones out of her life. Screw that. You tried. Raise your twins without added stress from someone who choose to not be apart of the family.", "NTA. I feel like you tried while Mary was alive to be in Lori's life, but she was so angry. She did not seem to want you in her life and since she's an adult you have no real obligations to her.\n\nHowever, you did raise her and have been a parental figure for most of her life. It's important to remember she is a kid and immature.  Maybe keep in touch enough to know you are still willing to be a part of her life if she wants.", "Leaning towards NTA\n\nIt sounds like you really tried both before and after your wife's death, to be there and have a relationship with Lori. Yes she was a \"child\", but not your child as her and her family made clear", "NTA. \nShe made her stance, you respected it. And decided you didn\u2019t want to deal with it. \n\nBut never to late to try and make a relationship.", "Info: How soon after her dad died did you ask for adoption? Did you say anything at all that can even be kind of mistaken to believe that you put Lori in therapy to facilitate the adoption? What specific complaints did your in-laws have about your relationship and not taking her with you?\n\nThis can honestly go either way. So much of this depends on details and unless we have them and know the real history between all of you, I don't see how we can even begin to properly judge here. If you came on too strong in the beginning since you mentioned her dad had been absent in her life, you fucked up from the beginning. If you just had a habit of not really understanding her issues, you might have screwed any chance for your family to stay together. Of course, Lori could have just been an asshole and you *had* to move away to properly take care of your twins.\n\nThis is a clear \"the devil is in the details\" thing and I'm not sure one side of the story is enough, especially since all of your in laws seemed to not be happy how you treated Lori. I am like 51/49 on a Y T A because I will tend to always give a child the benefit of the doubt over the state of a relationship with an adult because they were  a child and you were an adult.", "NTA, she made it clear who you were to her and she was an adult.

You were charged with the incredibly difficult task of caring for your two small children, and there is no way you could have done that while trying to care for a teenager who hates you and them.", "NTA.

It would really just drag you/your kids down still being around her. I think you dodged a bullet becoming her guardian tbh", "You dumped a 15 year old orphan because she was moody YTA", "Wish it was you and/or the twins who are also her siblings? I wouldn\u2019t have trusted her at all especially if she didn\u2019t want a relationship previously and I genuinely tried.", "NTA, is a horrible situation for her? Yes it is but is also a horrible time for you, she literaly desired that you and your children died instead of her mother, a teen can be a idiot and rebel, but actions have consequences.", "Holy shit, dude... I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but I think you're NTA.\n\nSince your wife's family couldn't go after you legally, I'm guessing, in order to keep Lori after your wife's passing, you would've had to force an adoption on her or something along those lines. You would've had an even angrier Lori on your hands. And I can't even imagine the sort of damage she could've inflicted on your twins \"out of anger.\" Listen, kids can go through shit and lash out, but you're only human. You can only take so much before you fucking break. I don't care if you're an adult. When you've reached the limit, that's game. And I'm tired of people treating children like they're not aware or have room temperature IQ; they know when they're intentionally hurting someone.\n\nLet's also not forget that Lori had the chance to be adopted by you. Granted, it was a bit tactless to approach her about adoption immediately after her father's death, but that option was on the damned table for YEARS. \n\nI think you looked after your own mental health and probably protected your twins with the actions you chose. If it's in the cards, maybe starting over with Lori would be a good idea.", "NTA. She was making your life hell and you had no legal authority since you were her stepfather.", "I would never, ever leave my stepchild who loved and needed me after a tragedy. But Lori literally wished death on you and your children.  You had no legal rights to her so what would have happened anyway? You probably legally couldn\u2019t have taken her with you and even if you were still in town, if she didn\u2019t want to see you she wouldn\u2019t have. It sounds like a tough situation but I think you\u2019re NTA. Maybe there was some breakdown in communication after your wife died too. You could have probably given it more time before up and leaving. But I\u2019ll stick with my judgement because I can\u2019t imagine what you were going through as well.", "NTA and don't listen to the pREDDITORs who are at it again. People here are big on letting kids and adolescents making choices and exercising their rights.

In this case the relationship didn't end because of that, but this was an ongoing issue for years and after her mom died you didn't had any legal power to make decitions for her, and she was very clear she didn't want you to be. You left them with the people who had the legal right to become her guardians, and that was after she wished death upon your children which yes, it was probably her grief talking, but it's not something that as a parent one should take lightly.", "NAH. Everybody here was grieving too keenly to be judged harshly for not making perfect decisions with the long-range view and 20/20 hindsight we have the luxury of exploring in the present.", "NTA", "YTA.\n\n>after marriage I was able to take on a more authoritative role and I started exercising it\n\nBeing married to her mom doesn't make you her father. It doesn't entitle you to exercise authority over her. You deserve to be treated with respect, not as a father figure. \n\n>When Lori was 13 her dad died and since he wasn't in her life for years Mary and I approached her about adoption\n\nSo the moment her father dies you decide that automatically makes you the father in her life?

Or give her the option to come with you? \n\n> since there was no adoption I had no legal obligation to her\n\nThis is not whether you were legally responsible for her but whether you were *morally* responsible, which is independent of the former. Moral responsibility stems from the relationships we have with other people. You met her when she was 5! Whether or not she called you dad, you were an adult/parental figure in her life. \n\n> years later I was surprised when Lori reached out to me through social media\n\nDid you do anything to encourage a relationship between her and her siblings? Did you ever reach out to see how she was doing? \n\nIt sounds like you had a really tough time with her as a teenager, complicated by the fact that you weren't her biological father. It also sounds like you had a really tough time dealing with your wife's death and I'm sorry for your loss. But grief or having a tough time with a teenager isn't an excuse to be cruel. Nor is it an excuse to abdicate (even *implicit)* parental responsibilities.", "NTA. You tried to be there for her and have her part of the family you were building with her mom.

It\u2019s not like she was 6 and didn\u2019t understand right from wrong. You tried your best with therapy and being there for her, but she was the one who wouldn\u2019t give an inch. Your wife sadly died and left you with awful grief and two young children to raise who you were legally responsible for. It\u2019s a harsh reality, but she made her choice for years while she was rejecting you. For her to come back now claiming you abandoned her is insane. You knew this girl since she was 5. You were in her life for most of it and she still refused to accept you. She can\u2019t blame all her actions throughout the years on grief from her mom passing.

A pissed off teen who never liked you could have easily ruined your life.", "NTA she may have been a teen but she was old enough to know what she was doing.

On some level, this was always about punishing her. And her father died, she wasn't abandoned by some deadbeat. Most children whose parents pass (especially when old enough to remember them clearly) don't want to be adopted because it feels like a betrayal. \n\nOn top of that, so much of this post just makes it clear you were trying to force a relationship throughout the marriage. That's the worst way to blend a mixed family. That poor girl had both of her parents die, and then you ABANDONED her (exactly like she said!) by dumping at her grandparents and then refusing to pick her up when planned.

During those four years I would say we had a good relationship. I didn't push and tried to get involved in her interests. Then when Lori was 12 puberty started to kick in and she developed an attitude. Normally Mary was the main disciplinary between us but after marriage I was able to take on a more authoritative role and I started exercising it.\n\nShortly after I started putting my foot down Lori would snap back with the \"you're not my dad\" line. It was rough but I tried to be patient and kept trying to maintain a bond without being a push over. When Lori was 13 her dad died and since he wasn't in her life for years Mary and I approached her about adoption and while I was prepared for her to say \"No\", but I didn't expect her to be so hurtful about it.\n\nMary chewed her out about it and I tried to get her to talk about why she felt so negatively towards me but she wouldn't open up. Mary and I tried therapy but Lori complained to the extended family who chewed us out for trying to use therapy as a way to \"force an adoption\" on her so we stopped. Mary unexpectedly got pregnant with twins \"Micheal\" (5m) and \"Michelle\" (5f) and we were very happy while Lori said she wanted nothing to do with them and hated how she was going to hear them cry at night. Again we approached the idea of therapy but Lori refused so we let it be.\n\nUnfortunately Mary was in a car accident and passed away. It was awful, I was a wreck and I had no idea how I was going to do all of this on my own. I tried to be there for Lori too but she would just lash out, said she hated me and wished that it had been me and/or the twins instead. I was done and told my In-Laws to get her and during those weeks that Lori had been gone had been a relief, so when school time was starting up again, I called my In-Laws and said that I wasn't going to pick her up and had plans to move back to my home state to be near my side of the family for support.\n\nSeveral members of Mary's side of the family started hounding me, calling me cruel, and that I was abandoning Lori. I reminded everyone that Lori was the one who wasn't interested in having a relationship and since there was no adoption I had no legal obligation to her. Mary's In-Laws tried to come after me legally but since I wasn't Lori's legal guardian it ended up not going anywhere.\n\nI moved away with the twins and years later I was surprised when Lori reached out to me through social media. After a few weeks of communication I agreed to let her come over to see them. After the four of us spent the day together Lori broke down after the twins went to sleep and told me how hard her life was after I left and asked me how I could abandon her. I reminded her of her past actions and she said that she was just a hurting teen and that I should've been the bigger person as the adult.

Not only did you have no legal obligation towards her bit she refused your authority, she rejected you as a father figure, she resented your todlers and wished death upon you and the kids (wtf !!!) . Many people here think this kind of attitude is acceptable bc she's a teen (and apparently Reddit think teenagers can do no wrongs and are saints and can wish death upon 5 y/o without consequences) but she absolutely created a toxic household and I kinda get why you wanted to better up your mental health after your wife's death.

A child of divorce that deep down wants her mom and dad to get back together. But everyone has different tools and it\u2019s easy in hindsight to see that it\u2019s also easy to see Simon one telling you they hate you as and wish you died and think well there\u2019s nothing more here. I would talk to her and explain how it was for you being pushed away by her and dealing with your own grief for your wife and sidedly being a single parent of twins.

I get she was young, but threatening death on someone isn't something to just brush off regardless of age. Children are capable of great harm also.\n\n\nETA. \n\n\nSo many of these YTA comments didn't even read the post. Lori was treating OP horribly for a while before her mom passed, even before her dad it also. . Her side of the family even bashed him and his wife for trying to find a middle ground.

Good luck \ud83c\udf40 to both of you.", "Soft YTA  \nI think it was in poor taste to just dump her without any communication or warning. That is very unfair to Lori after everything she had been through and likely made life even more impossible for her. She lost almost everything in such a short period of time and by the time she maybe would have warmed up to you or the twins (as a living piece of her departed mom), you turned your back on her too. I do understand being frustrated and hurt by her actions and aversion to you as well, especially since you gave so much to her and them. It is very normal for teenagers to say and do hurtful things, yet, normally not as extreme as \"it should have been you\"... BUT losing both parents at such a young age and in such tragic ways is not normal and therefore can cause long lasting trauma that causes people to behave irrationally. I'm not saying you needed to endure verbal abuse, but if you wanted to end your care of her, you should have done so in a cleaner or more empathetic way. I'm sure there were probably moments with your late wife where she really frustrated you, or moments that will come with the twins where they will say very hurtful things. I only hope that you can look past the hurt and stay by their side.", "NTA, she wants money. That's why she made contact and immediately laid on the guilt trip.", "YTA.

Because of that refusal,  you had no legal right to take her with you.   Legally,  she is a ward of your wife's family and they had the responsibility to make decisions for her well-being.  She may not have liked the result but that doesn't make you the AH", "NAH. Lori didn\u2019t want you to be her legal father or guardian when she was 13. She wished death on you and her siblings which was probably grief talking from the loss of her mom. The only thing different you could have done was tell her you have no legal guardianship of her and you are moving states away to be closer to your family. Then give her the option of having you as a legal father, going to live with extended family, or foster care. It sounds like 5 years ago, Lori would have chosen to go with her extended family anyway. This story was sad all around, sorry for your loss.", "NTA - I understand she was a grieving daughter, but she actively expressed she wished it was your other children who had passed instead of her mom.

Would that be right? If that's the case I would suggest that Lori was old enough to make her own decisions, which she had made abundantly clear when she expressed her desire that OP and the twins died instead of Mary. I do agree with many posters that Lori was also going through a lot and deserved some leniency and attention from OP, which OP tried to give. But, there is only so much OP can do to help Lori through this terrible time. Ultimately it was her actions and choices that led to her living with her grandparents, and although OP mentions nothing of the grandparents situation, is still likely a stable and loving atmosphere for Lori to live in as well.

I think if you gave the 14 yo one last outreach and she denied you, then you'd be NTA.  Instead, it's ESH.   It's water under the bridge now.

Sure she was suffering and a lot of people here will side with the kid but what about you? Your partner passed away and whilst you tried to hold yourself together and care for your stepdaughter she wouldn\u2019t accept you. Apparently you have no right to break and move away. You left her with family at the very least and cared for your twins. The best you can do now is just suck it up and acknowledge that you caused her grief and apologize that is if you wish to start anew. The fact she reached out may indicate she has some desire to have a relationship with you whether it\u2019s for the twins or because she also does miss you.

But that\u2019s not what you did. You stepped in to a parental role, raised and disciplined her, then abandoned her when the going got tough.

She had no one, and you ditched her when shit got hard. Who knows what kind of things she was feeling when she said that. Her fucking mom died suddenly and unexpectedly. It's a highly traumatic experience for anyone, let alone a kid. Not to mention, she was a teenager surging with hormones and a brain that had yet to reach maturity. Kids say and do the dumbest shit, but you got your fragile feelings hurt and bounced. Being a step parent means you chose to accept your wife, knowing she already had children. She was a package deal. If you aren't prepared to love that child like you would your own, then you should've stayed out of their lives.\n\nI say all this as a step parent who is divorced from my stepchild's mother.

Yeah, she was a troubled teen, and that allows a lot of leeway, but there's always a line.

Not every child wants to have a parental relationship with their parents significant other. Until her Dad passed she had a dad. The whole situation feels like no mutual relationship of respect ever formed in the first place. Still in that situation you should have know that as your twins grew up they might want a relationship with their older sister. That alone should have meant that you did the decent thing and at least checked in with her Grandparents and such as the years rolled by. This might have had to do with how they disagreed with your decision to abandon her. However if you truly ever cared for her, and you say you wanted to adopt her, you should have kept avenues of communication open and probably tried to support her financially as she was still a minor when her mom died. It bothers me that you didn't think what would her mom want for her and let that motivate you to continue to care for her.", "NTA. Yes, she was young. However, a 15-16 year old has enough of a conscious mind to know what\u2019s okay and what\u2019s not okay at that point / situation. Not only that, you didn\u2019t steal anything from her either.

If you'd kept her and not been challenged by her remaining family, you would have been continuing to deal with her anger, and her potential abuse of your twins, while grieving and trying to rebuild your life.
