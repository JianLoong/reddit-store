My dad is a very hard worker and I respect him a lot. He was the most hurt but still stayed strong for me even though his brother and mom passed away 2 days before the crash. He priorities me over everything and  loves me a lot ans I love him to. He raised me the vest he could and that's all that matters. It has been a very hard journey but it is what it is ig.\n\nSo now for the actual thing, my dad never dated after my mom passed, I always encouraged him but he always just told me that the business kept him busy and I would  eventually drop it. But now he had sold his business a few months ago so I pushed him into dating.he met Amy 7 or 8th months ago and he introduced me to her 3 months ago. Amy is wonderful and I realy like her. She is pretty and just wonderful. When she is with her I see her with the same face he has when we are together. And I am happy he is happy.\n\nI am still kind of in touch with my mom's family but My mom was never on good terms with them so I only go say hi once a few months when  my dad posters  me. \n\nSo when I had gone to their house a few days ago wirh my dad and amy. we were just chatting and I mentioned Amy, my dad were dating , my dad went awkward but I thought it dint matter If they knew.

WTF is WRONG with mom's family??? Your dad has gone above and beyond... Kudos to him.... and you for standing up to their abuse!", "NTA. After 9 years, they're on a limb to even remotely suggest a widower starting a new relationship is offside. I agree that they eff off. \n\nAs for an apology: well, when they proffer one, discussions can start. Until then stay no contact.", "NTA\n\nThey were rude af to your dad and about Amy. You put them in their place which they deserved. Fuck them.", "NTA.  Your mother passed away more than 7 years ago. The time for mourning should have ended. Your father's girlfriend is most certainly not replacing your mother who, by the way is dead and as a result doesn't care (!); rather, she is entering your father's life in addition to your mother.  He's a very lucky man to have two such special women in his life and your being in it just adds.\n\nAs for your mother's family: they need to get over it.  Life goes on. Your mother died; your father lived. He is entitled to fall in love again. \n\nYeah. You stated your position plainly and strongly.  But you're still learning how to be diplomatic.  Best.", "It wasn't very diplomatic but no, NTA, not at all because I think that is really what they should do, go fuck themselves. Your mum knew why she wasn't on good terms with them. I see no reason why you should be diplomatic to them if they are like that. Well, if you wanted to stay in contact, then, yes, but it doesn't sound like you would want it that much.", "NTA they can demand all they want, you dont have to see them", "NTA. \n\nTheir behavior was completely uncalled for. They can indeed go fuck themselves.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but for future reference you now know not to tell them things like this. Your dad has been dealing with them longer and so knows more about avoiding their minefields. That\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t mentioned he and Amy were dating, to avoid the explosion because he knew how they\u2019d react. They aren\u2019t really entitled to know about his love life.\n\nTalking about your dad dating again wasn\u2019t wrong because it would have been fine if you were dealing with rational people. But those people sound highly irrational. Let your dad navigate the interactions with them from now on and take your cues from him.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your and your dad\u2019s losses. It\u2019s wonderful that you are both in better and happier places. It\u2019s vile that those people feel a need to try to take that away.", "NTA, they can go and fuck themselves. What do they expect? Do they want him to be alone forever? 9 years are really long and it\u2019s not like your dad wants to replace your mum. No one will replace her wtf, they can fuck off", "NTA and I'm so sorry for your losses. Now you see why your brilliant amazing mom stayed away from her family of origin. She knew they were not worthy of her or her family. Follow her lead and let them go on their way and you and Dad and Amy have a wonderful life! All the good luck to you all!", "NTA", "Allow me to help with what you should say.\n\n\u201cI apologize for telling you to go fuck yourselves.  Your reaction to my father\u2019s relationship hurt me very deeply and what I meant to say was fuck off.  Pick a direction and start fucking if in it.  Keep fucking off until you get to a fence with a sign saying no fucking off past here, dream the impossible dream, climb over that fence and keep fucking off forever.\u201d\n\nThey owe you, your dad, and Amy an apology. You don\u2019t owe them shit.  NTA obviously.", "You're not an asshole, but it wasn't your place to say anything. Your dad should have mentioned they weren't aware though. They shouldn't care, it's none of their business and he's allowed to move on and be happy. However if you want to continue a relationship with them you'll need to apologize. I would ask them for one beforehand and wouldn't apologize unless they change their attitude on your dad moving on and dating.\n\nAlso for perspective, how long after your mom died did your dad meet Amy?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and your dad and Amy seem to have a really good thing going on as a family. If your mom's family can't accept that, then that's their problem and you should ignore them until they can. But it's nice of your dad to try to keep you and he a part of their life even though they don't deserve it in any way. You three rock. Just keep being yourselves and don't let anybody, including a bunch of family members who sound like they didn't care very much about your mom in the first place, destroy your happiness.", "NTA. Im sorry for your lost, but your father can be a Life and este again and be inlove again. Dont mean that he replace your mother, only that he is Alive and its prepared to date again. \nDont apollogice to your mothers family, they own you a Big APOLLOGY. They are the A.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nHe didn't date for 8 years. He's not replacing your mom - he continues his own life. \n\nHonestly, if not even your mom was close to her side of the family then it might be time to rethink your own relationship with them.

Buuuut\u2026 maybe they reacted that way because it opened up an old wound? Grief is really hard to overcome, I think you only really grow around it. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to fix their pain, but maybe place yourself in their shoes as to where their daughter is being \u201creplaced\u201d. \n\nKudos for standing up for your family though, it sounds like your dad is happy and I\u2019m happy that that makes you happy.", "9 years not 7 but yeah, everything you said!", "NTA They can\u2019t expect him be single forever.

They may be worried about their place in your life, might be heartbroken still over your daughter, or just generally unhappy folks.  Doesn\u2019t matter.  In the near decade since your mom passed the online important question is you and your dads happiness.  You are very mature and caring to want to see your dad find love again.  It might have helped to speak with your dad before hand to know what he wanted to share.  Your response was rude, but I really couldn\u2019t say that it wasn\u2019t deserved.", "NTA", "NTA They certainly earned that response, they should be the ones apologizing, not the ones demanding an  apology.", "NTA you and your Dad are so lucky to have each other and it seems like you both know it.", "Ya, it's been edited."]}
