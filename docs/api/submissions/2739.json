After 9 years, they're on a limb to even remotely suggest a widower starting a new relationship is offside. I agree that they eff off. \n\nAs for an apology: well, when they proffer one, discussions can start. Until then stay no contact.", "NTA\n\nThey were rude af to your dad and about Amy. You put them in their place which they deserved. Fuck them.", "NTA.  Your mother passed away more than 7 years ago. The time for mourning should have ended. Your father's girlfriend is most certainly not replacing your mother who, by the way is dead and as a result doesn't care (!); rather, she is entering your father's life in addition to your mother.  He's a very lucky man to have two such special women in his life and your being in it just adds.\n\nAs for your mother's family: they need to get over it.  Life goes on. Your mother died; your father lived. He is entitled to fall in love again. \n\nYeah. You stated your position plainly and strongly.  But you're still learning how to be diplomatic.  Best.", "It wasn't very diplomatic but no, NTA, not at all because I think that is really what they should do, go fuck themselves. Your mum knew why she wasn't on good terms with them. I see no reason why you should be diplomatic to them if they are like that. Well, if you wanted to stay in contact, then, yes, but it doesn't sound like you would want it that much.", "NTA they can demand all they want, you dont have to see them", "NTA. \n\nTheir behavior was completely uncalled for. They can indeed go fuck themselves.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but for future reference you now know not to tell them things like this. Your dad has been dealing with them longer and so knows more about avoiding their minefields. That\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t mentioned he and Amy were dating, to avoid the explosion because he knew how they\u2019d react. They aren\u2019t really entitled to know about his love life.\n\nTalking about your dad dating again wasn\u2019t wrong because it would have been fine if you were dealing with rational people. But those people sound highly irrational. Let your dad navigate the interactions with them from now on and take your cues from him.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your and your dad\u2019s losses. It\u2019s wonderful that you are both in better and happier places. It\u2019s vile that those people feel a need to try to take that away.", "NTA, they can go and fuck themselves. What do they expect? Do they want him to be alone forever? 9 years are really long and it\u2019s not like your dad wants to replace your mum. No one will replace her wtf, they can fuck off", "NTA and I'm so sorry for your losses. Now you see why your brilliant amazing mom stayed away from her family of origin. She knew they were not worthy of her or her family. Follow her lead and let them go on their way and you and Dad and Amy have a wonderful life! All the good luck to you all!", "NTA", "Allow me to help with what you should say.\n\n\u201cI apologize for telling you to go fuck yourselves.  Your reaction to my father\u2019s relationship hurt me very deeply and what I meant to say was fuck off.  Pick a direction and start fucking if in it.  Keep fucking off until you get to a fence with a sign saying no fucking off past here, dream the impossible dream, climb over that fence and keep fucking off forever.\u201d\n\nThey owe you, your dad, and Amy an apology. You don\u2019t owe them shit.  NTA obviously.\n\nEdit: my first award! Thank you kind stranger!", "You're not an asshole, but it wasn't your place to say anything. Your dad should have mentioned they weren't aware though. They shouldn't care, it's none of their business and he's allowed to move on and be happy. However if you want to continue a relationship with them you'll need to apologize. I would ask them for one beforehand and wouldn't apologize unless they change their attitude on your dad moving on and dating.\n\nAlso for perspective, how long after your mom died did your dad meet Amy?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and your dad and Amy seem to have a really good thing going on as a family. If your mom's family can't accept that, then that's their problem and you should ignore them until they can.

They may be worried about their place in your life, might be heartbroken still over your daughter, or just generally unhappy folks.  Doesn\u2019t matter.  In the near decade since your mom passed the online important question is you and your dads happiness.  You are very mature and caring to want to see your dad find love again.

Also, he wants to be sure if Amy is \"the one\" before he shares the news.  Grown-up relationships tend to be more serious and considered, than teenage dating and crushes of the month.  But again, maybe you just didn't know that.  Now you do.  The real AHs in this story are your mom's family.  They'll never get your mom back, but the world keeps turning for everybody still living, with lives to get on with.  They don't get to call people they know nothing about, a \"hoe\".
