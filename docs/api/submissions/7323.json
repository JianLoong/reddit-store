{"id": 7323, "submission_id": "10btcpt", "title": "AITA for blocking my parents from visiting my younger son unless they agree to treat my younger and older son equally?", "selftext": "I had adopted my older son [7M] about 4 years ago after practically being the only \"dad\" he had around for another 2 years before that. Wife's ex was a POS who left her pregnant and struggling.  For all intents and purposes he is my son, and well he knows about his sperm donor but in his own words, \"that man is nasty, I can't believe he could ever be my father.\" \n\n\nMy parents were less than thrilled that I married a woman who had a child, but (at least I thought) they had adjusted in a short while, and when I adopted him, they also jumped into the role of grandparents. And things were pretty normal for about 3-4 years. \n\n\nWife and I had our second child this year, and at the time of announcing the pregnancy, my mom made an underhanded comment to me in person \"I'm glad you finally saw sense and decided to have your own child.\" I rebuked her quite hard and stated that I'm not going to tolerate any favoritism towards their biological grandchild in front of me, or my children. That she is free to think whatever she wants but she cannot state it to me, or my wife, or my children ever. \n\n\nWell, my parents didn't comply. It started with stuff like forgetting to get my older son a gift when they came to visit, to when outright a while back when we went out for a meal during their Christmas visit, parents stated IN FRONT OF MY OLDER SON, that my wife should pay the tab for her son. To avoid creating a scene right there, I went and paid the entire tab and paid for a cab to take them home, as I didn't want them to be in the same car as me and my wife. \n\n\nAfter we all got back home, I told them that they are free to use their room till their flight day but they should not expect any kind of service from my wife (she handles most of the food) and that they cannot see either of my children. It got me quite an outrage from my extended family, and for the time being I'm myself being low contact with them because the restaurant incident had pissed me off. They also attempted to pick my child up from daycare but I gave strict instructions to not hand our baby to anybody but my wife or me, so it worked out and they left within 3 days. \n\n\nMy brother is on mom-dad's side. I got comments from the trio where they said \"We should've NEVER let you marry her,\" as if it was upto them at all. Being the younger son truly sucks. Anyways, I am currently low contact will all family, and have laid out 3 strict conditions to allow visits again: \"1. A proper apology to my wife, 2. A proper apology to my elder son and 3. NEVER showing any kind of open favoritism again, this includes either buying gifts for them both while visiting or don't buy gifts at all, never making my elder kid feel like they aren't his grandparents, etc.\" \n\n\nExtended family and my brother make me feel like the a-hole for, in their words \"putting a kid who is not even his child before his parents.\" So AITA?", "created_utc": 1673715669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10btcpt/aita_for_blocking_my_parents_from_visiting_my/", "score": 2839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would go completely no contact with all of them until they all apologize.", "NTA\n\nIf they know the specifics and are agreeing with your parents then they are AH. You do not want your older son to be treated badly by them, and you do not want to raise your younger son to think adopted children are not family.\n\nYou probably have to cut them off because you can't trust them anymore. You would be watching for favoritism, or slights for the entire time any of them are with either of your children.", "NTA.

Much better not to have extended family than to have them abuse and treat you like shit.", "NTA - not even close to being the asshole. My brother and his gf are in a very similar position. Just had a baby but his gf has a 7 year old from a past relationship. My brother loves that kid like he\u2019s his own. Baby is just over 1. Comments were made about how they need to get married and comments about how the new baby is their \u201creal\u201d grandchild. \n\nMy brother essentially cut them off after several attempts of communicating. It is so hard for parents to take criticism from their kids. They think it\u2019s okay to not follow rules parents set for the kids because they\u2019re the grandparents. They think cause they\u2019re your parents they still have say in how you should live your life. \nSorry but no- you follow the rules or you don\u2019t get time with either the kids or your son and his wife. \n\nPut your wife and children first. Always. Your family probably thinks they can bitch and moan enough in order to make you feel guilty and admit you\u2019re wrong. Don\u2019t allow it. Stand your ground. Both your babies are your children and their grandchildren. They deserve to be loved equally regardless who the biological father is. \n\nThe rules you set in place to allow future visits are completely fair. I\u2019d tell them they\u2019re your children and that them along with your wife do come before anyone. That\u2019s just reality.", "NTA\n\nYou adopted him, so he is your child. You responded to your parents behaviour in a brilliant way, IMO. I\u2019m not sure I could have let them remain in my house.

As soon as we got into the car, I thanked my mom for keeping her away from me because she was *so mean* that it was actually comical. I later wrote her a letter asking for genealogical information, and she bitched my mom out for having a nosy daughter. \n\nAll of my mom\u2019s siblings felt obligated to let their parents have a relationship with their kids, and I don\u2019t think they benefited from it (except having some shocking cocktail party stories about them).", "Reading the title was enough for a  NTA. I can't understand why people get so caught up with who shares blood with who. Your family is who you choose it to be. And that child IS yours because you adopted him.

Your kids will notice the unfair biases of their grandparents and other family, so the nc is beneficial for them.

Their treatment will scar him and you did well standing up for him and your wife.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems like you are taking care of your children and protecting them well against harm. This kind of shenanigans will stay with that kid forever if he's truly exposed to it.

No contact with any aholes who agree with this abhorrent behaviour.", "NTA at all. But your family members are all AHs. You are saving your older son a lifetime of hurt.

Be aware they will try some feints, because they will want to get to your younger son.", "NTA. I cannot fathom this.  I married my husband when my stepson was 6.  My parents didn\u2019t think of him as anything other than my son, and their grandson.  They already had two grandchildren from my sister close to the same age, and they never, and I mean ever, treated our son ANY different, including when our son together was born some 4 years later.  They treated all the kids the exact same.   \n\nMy mom died a long time ago.  Even my dad\u2019s now wife, who I have some minor issues with, never thinks of both our sons as anything but equal grandchildren of my dad\u2019s.", ">They also attempted to pick my child up from daycare but I gave strict instructions to not hand our baby to anybody but my wife or me\n\nYour parents are deranged. As bad as treating one child differently because they are adopted is, trying to take a 3 year old from daycare without the parents' knowledge crosses the line into dangerous.\n\nNTA", "NTA but I do think you have to start coming to terms with the fact that your family of origin is not compatible with your family and never will be. Even if they apologize, I don\u2019t think they should be in contact. Why would you want them around, knowing that under a fake smile they dislike and resent your child? Kids absolutely pick up on that sort of thing and he is going to wonder why you allowed it.", "NTA.   \nQuite right. You have two sons, one adopted, one by blood. Your parents therefore have two grandsons. They can feel how they like, but you WB TA if you let them show favoritism to blood over adopted. and they should understand they don't get to do that.", "NTA.", "NTA, you are doing the right thing. I don't know what their problem is, or where it comes from, but you are a father to your oldest son, and by the sounds of it a damn good one,and they should accept him as their grandson/nephew. I am glad you are standing up for both wide and son, because this nonsense is just rediculous!", "NTA even in the slightest. Wish I could've been there to see it go down at the restaurant. Sorry that they have something against the little darling just because they aren't related by blood. As someone who was pretty much taken in by their step family when they were a kid I feel this shit deeply. You're a fanfuckintastic person.", "NTA. I think you'll never get any apology, but on the off chance I'm wrong, they should _not_ apologize to your son. This has potential to be mishandled. It's better that they get him a gift and do something fun (supervised) with him.", "You're NTA. Good job standing up your your wife and son.", "NTA, you have two children, just because one doesn't share your dna doesn't change the fact you are their dad.", "NTA. In fact, you are so far from being the AH that the light from AH would take 3 billion years to reach you. May I recommend NC or LC with your AH family?", "NTA. You're a good dad for protecting your oldest child. The rest of your family sucks and I'm sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA. You absolutely stand by the family you have created with your wife and the mother of your children. It\u2019s stunning that you turned out to be such a good man after being raised by these horrid people.", "Well, you can see by all their awful comments that they aren't going to change. So for the sake of your little family, you should reduce contact to minimum or none.\n\nIf my extended family ever thought less of me for not being biologically related, I have never felt it. I was the princess. I was showered with beautiful gifts, taken on trips and treated to nice restaurants. That didn't change even when bio kids started popping up. Of course I was older and the littler ones got more attention for being little, but I was never not still a princess. we are family through and through. The love is *real*. And I don't think my parents ever had to tell anyone how to behave. \n\nEven if your parents and their flying monkeys *act* appropriately in front of you, their true feelings are poison. So no, NTA at all.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Good for you for sticking up for your family. Mom and Dad need to stop the bs.", "He is legally your son\u2014not only in your heart.  They have no right to treat your children differently.  I might not fund a college fund for a stepchild (maybe I would, it would depend on the situation) but I would never refuse to pay for their meal if I were paying or not bring an equal gift when I brought gifts for others (assuming it wasn\u2019t a birthday present and I was only bringing a gift for birthday person).\n\nYou are NTA, but your family sure is.  Good for you for taking a stand.", "So I agree with two out of your three conditions, but don't make them openly apologize to your oldest son because it will just reopen the wounds and draw attention to it, it should just be absolutely clear from this point onwards that they treat him exactly the same or else they risk not seeing any of you.

Oh man, I don't even know where to begin. I think you're doing exactly the right thing. You let them know your boundaries and expectations, and now the ball is in their court.

These people disgust me. Sometimes I find it hard to believe there are such cold hearted ppl in the world. I was in a similar situation. I have a daughter and married into a family that accepted her with open arms, like she had been there the entire time. I was blessed. But i don\u2019t see myself sticking around a situation like yours. Id never have allowed my child to feel anything but the love she deserved. I\u2019m not sure that even if they \u201cchange their minds\u201d I\u2019d let them be a part of your family because now you know how they really feel. Don\u2019t let your son live pretended to be loved. He\u2019ll feel the difference. Protect your family OP. Good for you for standing up to your parents. Too many times I see spineless \u201cmen\u201d bow down to the consensus of their parents and extended family. You\u2019re a fantastic father for both your children. Men like you are rare.

If they keep it up, just go NC with them and forget it. They seem incredibly toxic and should be out of your life. You, nor your family, need that negativity in their lives.

A stone in the shape of a human heart, but still a stone.", "Why does an apology matter? They don't love his older son or see him as a grandchild. He will figure that out even if they bring him gifts and pay for his dinner.

They were freaking OVER THE MOON to get a daughter in law and TWO granddaughters in one fell swoop. My 5 year old doesn't even KNOW what the hell half siblings are. My husband his family and the 5 year old would fight you if you even thought about saying they aren't her family. I didnt get inlaws, I got an extra few branches to my family tree. Posts like these remind me that there are worse things than my in laws overwhelming me because they love me so much."]}
