I wouldn't want her around either. \n\nNTA", "NTA, and I would tell her that your having a cat only becomes relevant when her daughter becomes trained to use a litter box instead of having \u201caccidents\u201d.", "NTA. \n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do about the cat. This has to do about the fact that her child is defecating on your belongings.", "NTA - my animals are trained to use the bathroom outside.", "NTA. I'm not a parent, and I know there's a lot of methods and ideas around potty training, but she doesn't get to expect everyone to be okay with her child pooping and peeing on everything all the time.", "NTA. WTH is wrong with her? Letting her kid drop a deuce where ever and thinking it's OK? She's not doing \"great\" if she's taking a piss in the middle of the living room floor. Part of the whole potty training process is teaching them good bathroom habits and hygiene. You know, don't leave a mess and wash your hands?", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't even matter if her kid is ready to potty train or not; the issue here seems to be that she ISN'T potty training her daughter if she's just taken her diapers away and is letting her run around pissing and shitting herself. That's not ANY kind of \"training\". To potty train, you have to actually be actively involved in your kid's toileting process, which again, she clearly is not.\n\nShe's going to do some serious damage to that child, frankly, because she's interfering with a whole raft of developmental processes by teaching a kid just over a year old (who is in the middle of a MASSIVE learning growth process) that it's okay to run around pottying wherever she goes, in other people's houses, in public, etc. This could end up being an issue that stays with her for years. As a former early childhood educator I've seen kids who ended up completely messed up because of parents like this. What she's doing isn't potty training. Potty training can happen anywhere, but when it's outside of the home the child should still be wearing diapers or pull-ups, and should just be taken to the bathroom regularly, asked if they need to go, etc.\n\nHonestly, for the CHILD'S sake, I suggest that you do not let her come over, and that you're very clear about why: tell her that her parenting choices are hers, but as long as her \"potty training\" does not involve any actual intervention or active \"training\" and just letting her child go all over your house, that you're not okay with that, and that it upsets your kids, and you can't have it in your home. It may end the friendship but honestly, she's harming her kid and that's more important.", "She can go visit her friends and family and see how they like shit and piss all over their house. People are so quick to scold when it\u2019s not happening to them.\n\nIf you still like this person say you\u2019ll happily visit her at her house for now. Maybe take your new cat too and let it do its business there \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "For me it seems a NTA situation. First of all it's your house, so If I want to come to visit, I need to respect your rules. Otherwise she can propose that you meet elsewhere for your childrens 'play-date'. The funny thing is that even your children, that are really young, are disgusted by that LOL\n\nAnd the comparison between his daughter and an animal is absurd.", "NTA - it is always shitty when this happens.  I'm sure dealing with this poops you out as well.", "NTA. That\u2019s really young to train, but not unheard of, especially if they\u2019re doing elimination communication where really the parent is training themselves to get the kid to a pot at the first sign of toileting needs. Clearly that\u2019s not happening here. \n\nI have never met someone who has been training (unsuccessfully) for months who doesn\u2019t have a different, reliable method for being out vs. at home. Do others somehow think it\u2019s great to clean up her messes in their homes? Nope, you\u2019re on solid ground in my book.", "NTA\n\nYou were very reasonable by still giving her the option to bring her kid, with the stipulation that she wore pull-ups. She didn't want to do that and it's your house. You have the right to say who does and doesn't come in.", "Nta. And for anyone struggling, underwear first and pull up over when you have to use a pull-up works well. Just the pull up locks away the moisture etc. (at least it did when we used them) so the underwear gets dirty and wet so the kid can feel it, but the pull up contains everything.", "NTA.\n\n> She got offended and said \"you'd let an animal into your home before my child?\"\n\nThe animals that come into the home are potty trained already.", "NTA. What kind of \u201cfriend\u201d allows their kid to pee and poop all over your home? One who doesn\u2019t respect you one bit. Her method of cleaning up pee by patting it dry repulses me just as much. You dodged a stinky bullet here. I would cut off all contact, bleach everything in my house, and breath easy *because your house doesn\u2019t reek of waste so it\u2019s safe to inhale.*", "Why are you even friends with her anymore? She clearly doesn\u2019t respect you at all. She even spread lies about you and turned her family and friends against you. She has no respect for you and is manipulating. Just cut her off and find better friends.", "NTA - this has nothing to do with animals, it's about not wanting someone's child to pee and poop all over everything in your home.  Especially since the child is (probably) too young, and I'm guessing the mom doesn't bring a training potty with her everywhere she goes.\n\nAnd it's fine if she doesn't want to use disposable diapers, but then she needs to use cloth ones with a waterproof cover.\n\nOffer to go to her home for playdates, but the child is not invited to your home until she is no longer a bio-hazard.", "NTA. I had a friend like this. She insisted her 1 year old was a genius because he was potty trained at 11 months old. He peed on my floor numerous times every time they came over, yet she refused to put him in a diaper. I think she thought that if she stopped buying diapers, the baby would automatically figure out that he needed to use the toilet.", "Ones shitting all over my floor, who\u2019s the fucking animal?", "NTA. You didnt happen to take pictures of the 2 year old's poop/pee, did you? Because then you could reply to those messages with pics of what the kid does and what the kitten does (pooping/peeing in the litter box where it belongs.", "NTA. It's unfortunate she used the animals explanation against you; obviously, if a pet shat all over your floors it wouldn't be welcome either.\n\nJust say you're tired of cleaning up your friend's child's urine and feces.", "None of this makes any sense.... does she just leave her daughter with you? Does she clean up after her daughter? Does she take her to the bathroom? I\u2019m so confused by why she doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve in Pull-Ups\u201d??? WHAT??? Why is this happening.... I can\u2019t wrap my head around this.... how did the cat get involved??? \n\nDefinitely NTA \u2014 it\u2019s just a shitty situation. What does her house look (or smell) like?", "NTA, your friend is nuts and i've never heard of potty training where they just wear clothes and no diaper/pull up, unless someone is obsessively watching and taking them to the bathroom, not just letting them go while they play. i thought the point of no diaper was to let them run around naked and realize when they start peeing so they can consciously stop it?", "NTA, does she expect this child to crawl to the potty chair?  I would hate to go her house; the stench must be awful as all the carpets and furniture are totally pee soaked.", "NTA, if she's doing some weird free-shitting experiment she can do it at her own house", "NTA.

They also don't have enough concentration or memory to stop what they're doing (to interrupt play /eating)or to remember they're suppose to go on the potty every time. Your friend is setting her daughter up for failure which will ultimately make potty training  more difficult and could even teach her child that tasks other people can do are difficult or take longer for her to learn.

I also consulted my pediatrician and waited until my child actually showed interest in being potty trained.  \n\nYour friend may be saving money on diapers but she is actively spreading bio hazardous material around her home and other peoples homes by allowing her child to pee and poop indiscriminately on floors, furniture,  etc. A true potty accident is still gross to clean up. \n\nI bet this same friend would not be so easy going if your 2 yr old starting pooping all over her house. And she was the one cleaning up the mess. \n\nHer comparing a human child shitting indiscriminately on the floor to a feline using a designated toileting area is ridiculous.

At first, I thought it might have been extreme. I thought she started potty training, and the child had an accident, and you were immediately done with no compromise. However, you have been more than accommodating. All you are asking is for her to do something to limit the chances of an accident happening in your home. This is 100% an acceptable request. I dont want my child or animals to use my home as their toilet, let alone someone elses. Was the last words a bit harsh, yes.

If she doesn\u2019t believe in using Pull-Ups on her daughter then she should be respectful and keep her daughter in the comfort of their own home before she is potty trained. It\u2019s one thing that it happens accidentally, but she is intentionally taking her kid to your house with no Pull-Up on knowing that potty training means there will be accidents, no matter how perfect one thinks their child is. It sounds truly as her daughter isn\u2019t ready and she should do right by her and wait until the girl shows expression that she is. Block her and all of her family/friends. You\u2019re not obligated in having them over or having them in your life.", "NTA.  You aren\u2019t putting an animal over your daughter.  You are putting your children\u2019s health and wellbeing over her desire not to spend money on diapers.  Letting her kid pee and poo everywhere isn\u2019t sanitary, and it could cause a backslide for your own 2yo if they are recently potty trained or in the process.  If she wants her house full of that sh*t, that\u2019s her business.  She doesn\u2019t get to decide you have to have it in yours.  \n\nAlso, if her kid is having that many accidents around the house, potty-training is not going well, because SHE isn\u2019t taking her daughter to the potty enough to reinforce the behavior she\u2019s trying to teach.

If the kid is showing interest then great! But just tossing out the diapers and hoping for the best is going to have the reverse effect.

But she told me it was plumbing issues \ud83d\ude33", "Many people feel that pull ups are counterproductive because it feels like underwear but also feels like a diaper and if you pee in it your skin is still pretty dry like with a diaper instead of obviously wet like with underwear. It can blur the lines between garments you can pee in and garments you can't pee in and make it harder for kids.", "Plus they train your kid for how underwear work.  They are a perfectly acceptable scaffold for a developing child", "She's not replacing mine, and as far as I know, she hasn't replaced anything of hers. \ud83e\udd14", "Our pediatrician said not to start potty training until your child shows an interest in it; you have to let them lead the way. Yes, children with older siblings tend to train a wee bit earlier than those without (mimicking behavior). But you gotta let them take the reins as to when. \n\nYour friend is doing her daughter no favors whatsoever. The ramifications are going to be significant if she doesn't change her approach. No pre-school or kindergarten is going to want a kid who regularly craps in the corner as a student. You also have the whole hygiene (shudder) issue to deal with too.", "That baby isn't old enough for sure. It isn't just reach a certain age and go for it. There's actually quite a lot that goes into it. Is the child telling you it's time for a change, bring a diaper or willing to sit on the potty?Monitoring food and fluid intake vs output timing. Can the child dress/undress with minimal assistance. Is the child verbally consistent in announcing the need to use the potty? I'm sure there's more, but it's been almost 20+ years since I've potty trained kids. All kids do it differently, my oldest was fast, my middle I held back because new baby was due at the same time. That last one? That one was a damned doozy! Only reason he finally pottied was I told him he couldn't go to school like his sisters.", "My mother waited until I was three and it took one lesson and that was all it took. My twin sons were way harder and took weeks at age 3.   Pull up or shut up I say. NTA", "The baby girl has no fault in this for sure, and as a baby she learns what her mother is teaching her. At the same time I cant fault your kid for feeling unconfortable in this situation.\n\nThe sad thing is the your friend doesn't seem to understand that, even If she loves her daughter and is trying her best, she can still do things wrong and do more harm than good to her.\n\nI hope she'll come around and understand that you're not tyring to undermine her authority as a mother, but ensure a safe and clean environment for your family.", "The way I just gasped. Ewww her house must smell so bad.", "Yeah, she was special.", "Good luck, but it's hard to have a serious conversation about something when the other party seems to think it's NBD. When you told her about it she knew what was happening and brushed it off. What got her upset was no more play dates at your house without Pullups. If you documented everytime the kid pooped/peed and where it might make a dent, but if she does the same thing at home, well...I don't get her either.", "As a mom of 4 kids I\u2019m completely baffled by your friend\u2019s reactions. As well as her friends & family. Why would they contact you??? .... Totally bizarre why any of this is happening & especially crazy why or how a kitten has any involvement in this situation.", "Hold up. So *you* have been silently cleaning up her kid\u2019s crap in *your* house for months now, and then she spreads crap about YOU???? She is too messy to be your friend.", "It seems like the logical solution to me, considering the mother has NO regard for your home or belongings, let alone your health.", "Yes where kitten", "Cat tax Cat tax Cat tax Cat tax Cat tax Cat tax Cat tax Cat tax!", "Yes. her kid's.", "I want to down vote this because \ud83e\udd22", "The first paragraph of this comment right here contains all required info.", "His motivation is so precious \ud83d\ude04", ">*My mother waited until I was three and it took one lesson and that was all it took*.\n\nThat's basically what I did, but there was no lesson.  When each of my two children were 3 I put cutsey toddler underpants in their drawer, showed them, and told them to let me know when they were done with diapers. \n\nWithin a week or so they each decided on the more fashionable option.  There was one accident - don't remember which kid - and that was the end of the diapers.\n\nNTA, OP.  Your *friend* is disgusting.  I wouldn't even want her in our yard.  I wonder if she picks up after the child outdoors.", "Exactly, even parents can get tunnel vision in trying to do everything right for their kids. Sometimes you really do just need that outside perspective even if it's not what you want to hear.", "The thing is she was right there watching all those accidents happen \ud83d\ude2d", "I'm not too sure why they're contacting me either as I really have no idea who they are... They just said that as a mom I should be compassionate towards a single mother.", "Yeah... I need to put my foot down on this \ud83d\ude36", "Kitty tax, must see the cuteness!", "Ok. I'd give up on her at this point.\ud83d\ude44", "I think it's highly likely that her friends and family got a different story to make your \"friend\" look like a victim and make you look unreasonable.\n\nYou are not being unreasonable.
