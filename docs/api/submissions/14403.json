You made plans and he agreed. An invitation to a last minute dinner is just that, last minute and should never carry the expectation that the person will accept. Wanting to stay with existing plans is reasonable.", "Wow, NTA.  But if this is how your husband normally reacts to disagreements, I would be seriously rethinking this relationship.  You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this.  Do you want your kids to think this is appropriate behavior?  If you have a son, do you want him to grow up thinking it is ok for men to treat women the way his father treats you?  If you have a daughter, do you want her to think this is how she should expect to be treated by the men in her life?  Your kids deserve to be raised in a family with healthy dynamics where the members treat each other with loving kindness and respect.", "NTA - You need to have a serious talk to your partner because if I spoke to my partner like that and disregarded her after all her work she would probably knock my damn teeth out which I wouldn't blame her for \ud83d\ude02", "Info:\nHow bad is your husbands concussion?

It\u2019s very concerning.", "NTA. If I were you I would pack my bags, when he and kids arrive leave to you parents or friend or hotel and stay there for a week or more. Do not talk to your husband.
