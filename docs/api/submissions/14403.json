He is a grown man, if he so desperately wanted to go to his parents house after mommy dearest called last minute and invited you two then he could have gone there. You already had food cooking, along with the expectation of staying home and relaxing.    You do you mama! Have some great quality alone time. treat yourself with a yummy dessert, watch whatever movie you want to watch or go take a nice long hot bath....  don't let your SO ruin your day.", "NTA. His reaction to you holding firm on your boundaries is incredibly concerning. If you plan to stay in this relationship, please seek couples counseling.", "NTA... If you're gonna drop plans on someone at the last minute you gotta fully expect the answer might be NO. And a Birthday? Did they forget this person had a birthday until literally that day?!! Doubt it. Had they mentioned it a few days ahead of time when they probably knew in the back of their head that this person had a birthday coming up, then that's a different story. Your husband's reaction is a little harsh though. He's TA here.", ">he called me an asshole and a stuck up bitch\n\nNTA. He's your ex, right, as of three seconds after he said that?", "I am trying to imagine any set of circumstances where it\u2019s acceptable for a man to call his wife a \u201cstuck-up bitch\u201d and I am coming up blank. \n\nNTA, and the number of women tolerating abuse from their husbands in this sub makes me sad.", "Bro it\u2019s your kids, you send them wherever the damn hell you please, if grown ass people are salty that tiny children aren\u2019t at their house then bruh idk but that\u2019s weird, a marriage includes 2 people and 2 families so why did they assume they get they way every time for holidays, acting like they got rights to your kids tf", "Obviously NTA, your SO is TA.", "Do a bait and switch on them next time and see how they like it", "NTA, he should have said \"sorry mum we already have plans since we didn't know you were doing anything it is very last minute wife is already cooking and we have plans for the kids maybe next time.\" Instead of \"yeah, sure, we'll drop everything and come over!\"", "NTA.", "May I suggest calling a girlfriend to eat the food, drink some wine and dance around to \u201cFlowers\u201d and other such tracks. \n\nAnd then have a very serious think about how much grovelling he should be doing for calling you names. It might just be words in the heat of the moment, but it speaks to an underlying disrespect for you - which is also evident in his actions of ignoring your work to make a lovely family Easter. Psychology indicates that contempt is incompatible with a healthy relationship. \n\nNTA obviously. And I hope you \u201ccome out of this cave of sadness\u201d happier after Easter.", "NTA\n\nAre we sure MIL's plans were last minute or is your husband just TELLING you at the last minute? Either way sucks.", "Nope NTA.\n\nMe and my wife live 5 mins from my MIL house and she is CONSTANTLY calling at 7pm saying \"bring the kids over now\" and it does my head in.\n\nI used to go along with it but most of the time I don't go over in these instances cos I'm already doing something and refuse to drop everything to go over and eat fucking spring rolls before driving back.", "NTA but your SO absolutely is I would suggest showing this to him as well to wake him up to what petulant little AH he is.", "My husband has NEVER spoken to me like that. And if he did I would\u2019ve driven over to MIL house handed him a bag of clothes to sleep at mummy\u2019s until he\u2019s ready to come home and apologise. I would\u2019ve then picked up MY kids and taken them home to continue my Easter plans.", "Nta. He agreed to the plans. Then he changed them without consulting you.", "This is bad advice. I agree that OP has every right to stand up for herself and setting a boundary by going away for a while might be helpful. But deliberately waiting until husband and kids are back means she's dragging the kids into this. \n\nThat's way she's punishing the kids for something they had no say in, and they will likely be left very confused and upset. This gives her husband ammonition to \"explain\" why mummy has left them using his own narrative (and let's face it, he won't be fair or honest).\n\nIf she needs to go alone, she could wait until they've settled back in and explain to the kids why she will be going away for a while. Or perhaps better, if she's up for it and logistics allow, take the kids with her and reassure them that she needs to stand up for herself, but that it won't affect her relationship with them.\n\nThen she gets to control the narrative, and the kids will learn that toxic behaviour like this is something no one needs to subject themselves to.", "Thank you", "Fair enough", "u/Depencss is a comment stealing bot\n\nLink to [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gwshm/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_mils_house_for/jfmfwx1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)", "I mean, if that\u2019s how you treat each other, you do you. Personally, it\u2019s never even crossed my mind to call a partner a name and I\u2019ve dumped someone who thought it was okay to call me a name. We can get angry, we can fight\u2026but disrespect and contempt are no-go\u2019s for me. Period.", "Absolfuckinglutely. Deal breaker.", "Cool story.", "I don\u2019t think MIL is necessarily in the wrong for making last minute plans. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to make last minute plans for whatever reason . There\u2019s also nothing wrong with you declining that invite. \n\nI get that going to his family\u2019s home in Easter was important to him (even though it was last minute) but it was no excuse to talk to you the way he did.  That was abusive and never ok. \n\nHe could have made a compromise. Visit the next day. He could have dropped in for an hour or FaceTimed them. \n\nThrowing an abusive tantrum is not ok.", "NTA- your sig O sounds like a major red flag. I mean seriously, wtf is wrong with them? I hope you're okay and okay going forward.", "WOAHHHH okay the second someone calls you a \u201cstuck up bitch\u201d is the second that this relationship is over wtf NTA is he always this aggressive??", "I think this might have been one of those times when I would have compromised. Yes, you had a roast in the slow cooker, but it would still have been lovely tomorrow. That said name calling, not OK and equally it's OK to want to have some family downtime. I guess the question is would you have still stuck to your plans if it had been your mom and your brother's birthday?", "NTA. Context aside, how dare he talk to you that way? \n\nIncluding context: your plans were prepped and in the process of being prepped. You're not nasty for not wanting to change them based on the whims of a third party", "People are upset about name calling but have totally missed the power play here. OP had to cancel plans with her own family because they took the kids. Then MIL conveniently came up with this plan at the last minute? I doubt it. She hijacked Easter.", "NTA why would grandparents be taking kids from their mother/ father on Easter? Are they enmeshed/ controlling and have your hubby under their spell too? Because he feels pulled to their demands more than he does to his own wife. Essentially the in-laws have your kids and hubby there without you. This is what they want and will do after a divorce. Start protecting yourself and your kids now by seeking the advice of a divorce attorney. Also don\u2019t take any bait that would lead to you reacting in a way that they could twist into you being abusive so that they can have the upper hand in a custody battle. I may be over- extrapolating here, but can realistically see this coming if you don\u2019t protect yourself. Better to be safe than sorry.", "NTA. You made your choice to stick to the initial plans.\n\nHowever, I always find it really confusing when people aren't flexible at all around their plans. Like cool, you started preparing the dinner, but you could have stopped baking the chicken, and gone to the bday party and finish the baking the next day (yes, you can do that!)\n\nPlans change and I wouldn't make such a big deal out of it. \n\nHowever, your husband's reaction was highly inappropriate... He's the asshole.", "If I were you I divorce the husband we all know he will put his family first over you . And when you do take custody of the kids", "Why did he not check with his brother? Why did MIL remember her son\u2019s birthday only at the last minute?", "Send him with a suitcase.", "For real. My husband and I would never speak to each other like that in a million years.", "Ah yes domestic violence over an insult that's the answer", "Same. I would live in a hole in the ground before I would live with a man who calls me a bitch in my own house. Name-calling is a dealbreaker.", "This is the agreement i have with my girlfriend, also. For both of us, you can point out my shortcomings all day long, you can express frustration and impatience and anger and whatever else. I WILL LISTEN AND TAKE IT ALL IN. If it ever gets to \"You're such a __,\" that's it, I'm through. There will be no second chances. It should never get personal.", "I've done medieval fighting, if my BF ever called me a bitch he would have to run from my longsword, 2 axes, dagger and halberd. \n\nLuckily he is just a good guy who wouldnt dream of it", "Is it impossible to go to your family without your kids? Why sit at home alone?", "Happy Easter!", "Uhhhhhhhh", "I guess its a matter of perspective. If you decide to not use this kind of insults with your SO, it can sound like abuse if you hear others doing it. In your case this is the language you both are fine to use with each other, so its definitly not abuse.", "Same here. I called my husband (the Dutch version of) an AH once, early in our relationship, when he accidentally destroyed something important to me, and I regretted it immediately. We have a sense of humour where we make fun of each other, but we never call each other names, except a few very mild ones that we make funny by saying them in a French accent. And never when we argue. I think that if we went down that road of name-calling, we would argue more than we do now (which is nearly never, and if we do argue it's always solved rather quickly).", "Right? My girlfriend's the most wonderful person on the planet! It would never cross my mind to call her a derogatory name."]}
