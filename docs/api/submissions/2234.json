Find somewhere else to stay or deal with it.", "ESH. For a guest, you're acting pretty entitled.

You'll both know not to get in that situation again.", "best part is, it\u2019s not even her house lol", "If I offer someone the sofa bed to sheep on in my house I absolutely do not barge into that room when they may be sleeping ir changing.\n\nA guest should have the expectation of privacy in their sleeping space.", "I'm going to disagree in this case.\n\nIf the living room involved was a part of an open plan space with no way to close it off from other areas like a kitchen or dining room, then yes, you would be correct that changing in the bathroom is the thing to do.\n\nHowever, OP noted the presence of a door. One that was, in fact, closed. This indicates that it was not open plan. That privacy was possible. And the need for privacy was being indicated.\n\nWhile the room is normally used as a living room, it was currently doing double-duty as a guest bedroom for OP and her GF. The ability of the room to be closed off for privacy means that the rules of guest bedroom courtesy take precedence.\n\nThose rules say \"closed door? knock first and wait for an ok before proceeding & proceed with caution even then\". GFs mom did not follow those rules.\n\nAnd yes, it would suck to have that room less than fully available as a living room during the visit. But thats just what you have to put up with when a dual/mutli purpose room is being used as a guest room.\n\nIf OP and her GF were staying in a dedicated guest bedroom, it would be crystal clear that they were n t a. imo, the presence of the door is enough to tip it in their favor. I say they're NTA.", "OPs gf here, I told OP it was okay to change in the living room as my sisters were upstairs and I thought my mum was outside smoking", "the real reason is that my girlfriend no longer lives with her mother as she is an abusive alcoholic and so she stays at her nans house. normally she can stay in her aunties room, however her younger sisters have been staying due to some issues with the mothers house and so the living room was the only space for us", "it\u2019s not her house. it\u2019s my girlfriends nans house that i was staying at. me and her don\u2019t get along because she is an alcoholic and has treated me very badly in the past", "Are you serious?

Joyous day if it's your girlfriends!\n\nETA Nevermind, found the answer in another post. Your future MIL sounds like an absolute delight! /s", "Not if the area they were given to sleep isn't private or at least somewhat private..\n\nI've crashed with friends where there were several of us and literally threw a cot down in the kitchen.  The fact that the kitchen is where I slept for a couple of nights doesn't make it my space to lay around in my underwear.", "I get what you're saying but if the guest is staying in the living room then the expectation is to get up when the house gets up.  You can't possibly argue that if your guest is someone that wants to sleep until 1:00pm for instance that the rest of the household should accommodate and avoid the living room so that their guest can treat it as a typical guest bedroom.\n\nOur house growing up had a living room and a family room/den so if there was another family space available then maybe in that case I could see it but if this is the only living/family space in the house then the guest should be respectful to the rest of the household and on the household schedule, not theirs.\n\nYeah it's a little inconvenient for the guest but it's also inconvenient for the family that was gracious enough to allow someone to crash in their living room vs directing them to a hotel.  To me that's the difference between respectful/appreciative and entitled.\n\nId also argue that you don't have rights to anything in someone else's home and thats a consession that you make and should accept when chosing to stay there and save a few bucks over a hotel.", "I get it but I think this is a perfect example of how risky that is.", "The only space for you or for the two of you, though? Like, was it possible y'all could have just stayed in your girlfriend's room but not in the same bed?", "Where does it say in the post that it isn't the gf's mum's house? If it's a comment further in I missed it. The way it's written implies that it is. I'm amazed that manners are gone because everyone is more concerned with being right. Being kind costs nothing and her \"thanks for the apology\" was childish and petty and doesn't make her right.", "My apologies.

There is already too many people in this house for you to have visited, and staying in a communal space is just an AH move.", "i live 3 hours away and her mum and sister didn\u2019t go to the house until i was already on my train. do you expect me to have turned around and gone home?", "No, I expect you to act like an adult and not change clothes in the living room.", "You can tell everyone on this sub is 19 because no. Get out of her fucking house if you wanna be rude and drag something so dumb out throughout the day. YTA", " I think OP's still being rather civil given the circumstances. I would've turned the air blue if someone barged in on me naked/changing, especially if they'd just been told about it \n\nY'all are doing great and behaving like normal adults, don't let anyone convince you otherwise", "This sounds tough for you as well. I hope you\u2019re doing ok \u2764\ufe0f", "I think you missed some background info. This isn't mom's house.  Mom is a guest. OPs gf is not a guest and is living there because mom is abusive.

When you're a guest in someone else's home you act like it and show the respect deserved to both the space and the host.
