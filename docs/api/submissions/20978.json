If you stand up for yourself and own your decision, what's the worst that they could do? (genuinely asking here).

I can't imagine any chance of having a partner and enough stability to build your own family while living with your curfew and control loving parents who are expecting you to pay towards their upkeep.

Don't let someone make major life decisions for you.\n\nThe facts are you shouldn't have to lie to avoid being controlled, guilted, and manipulated by your family.

Do make sure your phone doesn't have anything on it that will let them know your location. Your family is sufficiently controlling to have planted something.", "NTA.

It sounds as if you have very controlling parents who might try to stop you from leaving if you told them ahead of time. It can be hard to explain to a parent that while you love them, your choices may be different than theirs, and you may want a different lifestyle. \n\nThat said, it will obviously make them very angry. Although, they are likely to be angry either way. And at least your way means you are not present for the anger.
