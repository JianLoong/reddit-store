I had no idea about the missing person report still being a possibility. my parents called the cops on me claiming that I stole their car (that they bought for me) and that they wanted it back or I'd be charged. turns out that was their way of trying to make me come back home. I ended up returning my car with the help of my best friend and her oldest sister, and they gave me a ride back to their home since them and their family agreed to take me in. I had also forgotten my important documents other than my passport and driver's license. had to eventually go back home and confront my parents (with my boyfriend and my best friend, cuz i was scared for my safety) for them to hand my documents over. it was a whole mess, I called the cops on my parents, and they finally surrendered my docs. my parents tried making accounts to stalk me on my social media, since I blocked their numbers in my contacts, and I still blocked them even then.\n\n I've been able to talk to my parents on a handful of occasions now, exchanged numbers, visited home, but I never really reach out or talk to them at my own will. it gives me so much anxiety, i often get panic attacks at idea of being around or interacting with them. but they reach out. claiming they miss me and that I should come home and hang out sometime without my boyfriend. I refuse to visit my family without my boyfriend by my side. my parents also hate my boyfriend, most likely cuz they're racist. they also believe that I ran away from home cuz I got a boyfriend. i never left any indication or message of my departure. my family probably thinks I'm just being rebellious and shit talking about me, but I could care less. when have they not shit talked about me? never. they've called me crazy, insane, stupid, the worst child, sibling, human being in the whole world and universe. said I needed to be put in an asylum because something was wrong with me. dad laughed at me when I felt suicidal, and told them I didn't feel safe with them. had objects thrown at me. was the scapegoat and punching bag whenever my parents were stressed out. mom saw me as an extension of her and treated me accordingly with her insecurities and projections.  I could go on and on. \n\nmy advice to you: go with your plan and leave them a letter if you want. you honestly don't need to leave a letter. move out with your friends, go to the uni u want, and live your life the way you want to. chase your dreams. you deserve it. when were you ever able to live how you want? this is now your chance. if they somehow ever contact you in the future, set boundaries. you are not obligated to have a relationship with your family or be close with them. you are not obligated to stay in contact with them. you are not obligated to apologize for how you left them. no matter how much they guilt trip, victimize themselves, and gas light you. you are not obligated to deal with and put up with their manipulative tactics. dont tell them where you live, or at least your address. don't tell them what uni you go to. you have complete control over yourself, mind, body. you have complete autonomy. you can choose to leave an uncomfortable situation whenever you want. you are not being dramatic, nor are you overexaggerating. your experiences, memories, and emotions are valid and real. when you do escape, just keep in mind that you will have unpleasant memories and emotions that will pop up when you get triggered. you will feel and remember things that you thought wasn't real or possible. work through them, feel them, let it flow through you. suppressing, criticizing, and holding on will not benefit you in the long run. give yourself compassion. there is absolutely nothing wrong with you. seek therapy. it'll help you experience your emotions healthily, find healthy coping skills, it'll help you process through your trauma, etc. there will be people who say that your parents miss you and love you, and that they tried their best, that you should go back home. ignore them, they have no idea what you went through and have no right to say that. we may be complete strangers, but from the very bottom of my heart, I am so proud of you for taking this step. I am so proud of you for not staying in that toxic environment. I am so proud of how brave, resilient, and determined you are, with everything you've gone through. I know this is going to be really scary and a huge change, but I believe in you. you got this. feel free to reach out to me at any time if you need any guidance or just a listening ear. \u263a\ufe0f", "God, I hope this has a happy ending.

Even if you parents aren\u2019t linked to your account, if they know any of your current account details they may attempt to drain your account. \n\nIf you have student loans coming through you don\u2019t want this going to them.", "NTA \u2013 Before I get into my reasoning, I want to mention something I haven\u2019t seen come up yet: it might be a good idea to delete this discussion.\n\nYour post probably contains sufficient information for anyone who knows your family to identify you, especially if they also see the further identifying information in your comments. You can edit your post and comments, but that won\u2019t get rid of the bot comment that reproduced your post, or the comments by other redditors that reproduced identifying information. Deleting active discussions breaches the rules of the sub, so if that bothers you then you could ask the mods to do it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want the discussion deleted, I\u2019d consider editing your post and comments to either remove some identifying information or make it less specific, particularly the following: your town; your father\u2019s occupation; sibling details; details about your extended family; and details of the unis you applied to (I notice you mentioned one in a comment!).\n\nAnyway, back to the AITA question. As I said, you are NTA. Your family\u2019s behaviour extends beyond a culture clash or controlling behaviour to actual abuse, per Western values. On top of that, it sounds as though your mother is emotionally abusive. It\u2019s a shame that your family have driven you to hide your plans, but that\u2019s their fault, not yours \u2013 as you\u2019re worried that their reaction might go beyond verbalising disappointment, it would be foolish to be more open with them. Sending them a letter should help assuage any irrational guilt about what you\u2019re doing, and it might make reconciliation with your family more viable in future (should you choose to pursue it).\n\nI have a few bits of advice that I haven\u2019t yet seen in the comments:\n\n(1) If the process hasn\u2019t changed from my uni days, your family could ask you to show them UCAS details that would reveal your plans (for redditors outside of the UK, UCAS is the organisation that manages uni applications over there). It sounds as though you intend to leave before A-level results day, which helps, but I\u2019d consider a contingency plan whereby you get a friend to contact the police if you don\u2019t check in with that friend in person by specified dates (maybe give them a signed letter explaining your concerns to show the police). If your family restricts your access to the outside world, it wouldn\u2019t take long to prevent or otherwise wreck your entrance to uni this year.\n\n(2) It might be worth contacting UCAS to make sure your account is as secure as possible. Maybe you can get a note added to your account; maybe you can ensure that they communicate with you only by the email address you give them; maybe there\u2019s something else that can be done.\n\n(3) The Student Loans Company will also have records of the uni you enrol at, and it will be on correspondence from them, so it will probably be wise to sever the link between you and your parents regarding your loans ASAP.\n\n(4) Your tuition fee loan and maintenance loan can probably be adjusted to reflect your change in circumstances (by which I mean it will presumably no longer be appropriate to take your parents\u2019 income into account). If you\u2019re financially independent and have little or no income, the amount you\u2019re eligible to receive might well increase, at least after the first term.\n\n(5) It could be worth engaging in some misdirection, particularly if you intend to tell your parents that you\u2019re still going to uni (it might be a bad idea to even tell them that, although I\u2019m guessing your situation is easier because you\u2019re male). You could do so by travelling to a city you won\u2019t be living in, then posting your letter from there, so the postmark on the envelope will mislead your parents about your whereabouts without you needing to lie.\n\nBest of luck with your results, with your plan, and at uni, u/Chicken_testicles.", "NTA.
