They may have changed the emancipation part, but that\u2019s beside the point. However, in abusive situations- and I would consider yours abusive- the federal government financial aid program considers you an independent student. So talk to the financial aid office about your situation and how to proceed. You may be eligible for better terms of loans as well.", "Legally university's can't even confirm you are a student without your consent.", "I can imagine manipulative relationships very well.  You all are acting like the OP literally has no power in this situation.  Of course they do.  We are talking about an adult.  Running away and hiding will never resolve this.  It needs to be met head on.", "To be honest, the bank acc does not matter as long as parents are not named on it. In UK the parents would not have any rights to it unless their names are on it. Very strict rules. Also most banking is online now so as long as that's s cure he's all good.", "You really have no clue what abusive relationships look like especially between children and parents. You just sound tone deaf and unempathetic.", "Most unis in the UK have some kind of student services and free counselling service, it's definitely worth looking into!", "I just wanted to say I am very glad you did not unalive yourself. Best wishes going forward and I hope you find joy at Uni.", "NTA, run and don't look back.", "Yeah, but your parents had a punching bag (you) instead of therapy:(", "My bio father P was kind of like this- expressed that therapy doesn\u2019t work and it\u2019s a scam to get money out of you for nothing. Recently found out that he and my mom had gone to a therapist around the time I was conceived, and I imagine the fact that my mom didn\u2019t immediately become the wife he wanted resulted in P having this perspective. He was very reluctant to let me go when I was 13- a year after I had an attempt at unaliving as well. However, the progress I made changed his mind. \n\nComparing things is unkind. I\u2019m sorry your parents were like that. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting out and I hope you seek therapy when your housing and school is set. It\u2019s life changing, especially after escaping a toxic environment, and that\u2019s how it was for me. \n\nIf there is anything that they technically own or pay for- like a phone, a car, anything like that- find a way to switch it to your own account or leave it behind. If their names are on your car or a sufficiently high price item, or they pay for a service, they can claim theft. The more expensive, the bigger your headache. \n\nGauge if it\u2019s safe to suggest your own ownership of these items and if it\u2019s worth the risk. Do it as soon as possible, not close to leaving. Prepay phones are easy to get. Something like a laptop would not count toward this unless it is explicitly for the family and multiple people regularly use it. That kind of thing, leave behind. Your own laptop that was a gift or something? Take with you.", "I've read stories of people being friends with the bankers and trying to pull stuff so I still suggest a different bank, unknown to the parents.", "What I am is pragmatic.  If OP just disappears they will not let this go.  The only way to let it go is to show that you are not going to be manipulated anymore.  You are entitled to your opinion on how to handle this, but what I have a clue about or don't have a clue about is not something you can assess.  You know nothing about me or my life.  I am very empathetic to the situation.  I am simply suggesting a solution that will actually work rather than one that will cause more problems.", "They can probably also help you with stuff like making safety plans, talking to the financial office to make sure your parents can't interfere with your tuition or enrollment, talking to the campus security (and your RA if you live on campus) so that your parents can't show up and confront you at school, etc. You are probably not the first student to attend your school while escaping from an abusive household.

Your mum sounds exactly like my mum. My mums a narcissist and I know this word gets thrown around alot but I honestly think yours sounds the same.

Your 19 so as long as you are being reasonable and not interfering with your families home life too much you can do whatever you want, your an adult!\n\nDefinitely just leave a note, conversations don't work with these people and there's no way she's going to engage in it productively.

Wish you all the best and hope everything will work out!", "NTA. And don't feel like you need to leave a letter, OP; straight ghosting them would be perfectly acceptable, at this point.\n\nJust, as others have mentioned, go to the police beforehand and let them know you're safe and simply moving away, to avoid future headaches.", "NTA. Enjoy your freedom!", "NTA. Make sure you've got everything mapped out beforehand. Job, rent, food, etc. Once you light this firecracker there's no going back.", "NTA, and I hope you enjoy your new life!", "When I turned 19 I moved across the country (United States) on my own, and I am so glad that I did. I experienced things that I never would have otherwise, and my few years of wanderlust hold some of the best experiences of my life. It wasn\u2019t always easy. I was usually poor. I slept on the floor for a year before I could afford a mattress, but man was it worth it. I recommend to anyone that has the capability to travel when they are young to do so.", "Reading the great advice and your own reactions, you seem to be level headed and very organised. This is a horrible situation for you to be in when most young people your age have the full support of their family. Yours appear to want you as their retirement plan.\n\nI am sure you'll do well at University. My only suggestion is to let the student counsellor know what has happened and why you need autonomy.

You are an adult.  Start believing that.  \n\nTho your family culture may be as you say(sons live with parents--all of them????), London culture/UK culture is not.

Do what you need to do to achieve your independence--since that seems to be your goal.  And also be prepared to deal with/go low/no contact with parents until they accept your choices.", "NTA but certainly cowardly. Are you willing to potentially destroy your relationship with your parents? If so then go w/ your plan. If not, prepare yourself with potential discussion points and the reasoning behind your decision and come clean. It could lead to an argument that does damage your relationship, but they might surprise you. Parents ultimately want what is best for their kids and makes them happy.

Abusive people do not care for others opinions and it's safer to get away rather than try to reason with people that don't want to be reasoned with.
