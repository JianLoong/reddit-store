SIL doesn't respond to people being firm with her,  it appears sarcasm is her kryptonite!   I know it's your wife's family, so it might be hard for you to be the one to lay down rules, but if your wife is half afraid of her, then you might have to be the one who does it, at least until your wife is able. I agree with the other posters saying that you might want to go light to no contact for a while. (Definitely talk it over with your wife first, maybe establish your boundaries as a family.)  Watch carefully in the future, you don't want her to go trying to hurt your daughter over her crappy opinion. (But I think you got this!)", "NTA, it is good to know that she can't take being mocked.  And congrats to you for standing up for wife, particularly when she is in a vulnerable state.  When your wife is feeling better, she does need to take her on, and tell her what are appropriate boundaries and what are not.  Your sister in law sounds like she thinks she is the matriarch leader of the family, and is all wrapped up in everyone's business.", "Play stupid game, win stupid prizes.\nYour SIL was told more than once to keep her opinion to herself, but she ignored you and continued. So, she had to face the consequences of her own actions.\nMaybe your reaction could be seen as petty or childish, but it's understandable.\nI would have banned her from the hospital the moment she opened her mouth and berated you and your wife, that she was going through a rough time after the birth of your daughter.\nContinue to protect your family, and be sure to set hard boundaries with your SIL, because I doubt she would stop and for sure she'll continue to mock you for your daughter's name at future family gatherings or maybe even with her when she is older.", "NTA. So she can dish out the hurtful things but not take them. That's always the way, isn't it. I think you did a great job at standing up for your wife and child. I'd go low contact with SIL, she sounds like the worst.", "NTA. The name of YOUR child is really no one's business. A comment is one thing, but continued harassment is unwarranted and ridiculous.

Sister is the asshole though.", "I'm sorry but from where are you getting that SIL vocalised what everyone was thinking? There is nothing in the post to even remotely indicate that. No discrete nods or approval from the family to what the sister said to indicate stuff. \n\nYou just pulled some baseless assumptions from somewhere and decided that to be the truth and judged according to your assumptions. This is ridiculous. \n\nThere is always the I N F O option if you want further clarification but you just wanted to run with your own assumptions.\n\nAlso, just because the name isn't significant in your culture doesn't mean its common or significant in OP's culture or has a deep meaning to their family. As long as the name is not ridiculous and affects the child in the future, I don't see what's wrong with it and why you are so judgemental about it.", "What everyone will be thinking?

Toxic jerks are most safely expelled and ignored. NTA", "ESH.\n\nIt is a pretty strange name and typically people share these things to avoid parents doing stupid crap and inflicting misery on their kids.  You made that choice specifically to avoid anyone discussing the name before it was pernament in the hope that everyone would just keep their opinions to themselves after the name was permanent.  \n\nYou kinda created this issue by your actions and if the name was truely outrageous I'd be blaming you 100%.  As it stands I'd say your sister should be letting it go.", "You say it had no impact, I say it did.\n\nShe shrugs off people yelling at her, but she became furious at being mocked.
