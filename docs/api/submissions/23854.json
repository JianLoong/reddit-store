Kudos on the snarky response. 10/10! Secondly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing all you can for your wife! Protecting her from the SIL and helping her through PPD. I have four kids and by my last one, it was so bad that I started having those really bad thoughts.  Just keep an eye on her, in case she gets worse.", "My mother loved calla lillies and I think it's a great name! NtA and the sister is just mean.", "NTA \n\nKeep retaliating until she stops!", "NTA. Wow SIL is a piece of work. Calla is a lovely name. Good luck with the witch.", "ESH - the sister for vocalizing what everyone will be thinking, and you for putting everyone in a position to think that in the first place.", "NTA. And I looooved your come back.", "NTA. Calla is a gorgeous name. It's also the name of a beautiful flower, which makes it even more awesome!\n\nIgnore your SIL, she sounds like one of those people who cannot help themselves from sticking their noses into other people's business.

Well done, you've also found her emotional achilles heel so the rest of the family knows how to put her in her place in future.

Are you a Stephen King fan?  \"Wolves of the Calla\" was the title of book 5(?) in his Dark Tower series.", "NTA but why do you still let this woman in your home?", "NTA\n\nCalla is a nice name\n\nYour sister showed herself up in front of everyone and you called her out on it in public.  Good for you for standing up for your daughter.  SIL was definitely not looking out for her but instead was trying to be superior and putting you and your wife down.", "Do not let her around if she\u2019s causing undue stress on your wife!

SIL doesn't respond to people being firm with her,  it appears sarcasm is her kryptonite!   I know it's your wife's family, so it might be hard for you to be the one to lay down rules, but if your wife is half afraid of her, then you might have to be the one who does it, at least until your wife is able. I agree with the other posters saying that you might want to go light to no contact for a while. (Definitely talk it over with your wife first, maybe establish your boundaries as a family.)  Watch carefully in the future, you don't want her to go trying to hurt your daughter over her crappy opinion. (But I think you got this!)", "NTA, it is good to know that she can't take being mocked.  And congrats to you for standing up for wife, particularly when she is in a vulnerable state.  When your wife is feeling better, she does need to take her on, and tell her what are appropriate boundaries and what are not.  Your sister in law sounds like she thinks she is the matriarch leader of the family, and is all wrapped up in everyone's business.", "Play stupid game, win stupid prizes.\nYour SIL was told more than once to keep her opinion to herself, but she ignored you and continued. So, she had to face the consequences of her own actions.\nMaybe your reaction could be seen as petty or childish, but it's understandable.\nI would have banned her from the hospital the moment she opened her mouth and berated you and your wife, that she was going through a rough time after the birth of your daughter.\nContinue to protect your family, and be sure to set hard boundaries with your SIL, because I doubt she would stop and for sure she'll continue to mock you for your daughter's name at future family gatherings or maybe even with her when she is older.", "NTA. So she can dish out the hurtful things but not take them. That's always the way, isn't it. I think you did a great job at standing up for your wife and child. I'd go low contact with SIL, she sounds like the worst.", "NTA. The name of YOUR child is really no one's business. A comment is one thing, but continued harassment is unwarranted and ridiculous. SIL is a bully. Do what you can to prop up your wife's confidence, and bring the SIL down a few pegs. Peace", "NTA, and good for you!\n\nCalla *is* a name.  It's Greek and means beautiful, and as someone who *adores* Calla lilies, I think its a lovely choice for a daughter!  TBH, while you might have framed it \"mocklingly\", none of what you said to SIL is wrong.  she's *your* daughter, nobody else's opinion matters.  Her shitting on the name, which IS a name, isn't \"looking out for your daughter\", it's being a self-obsessed shit", "I agree with this. I think my wife would struggle with the decision some. But maybe if said just temporary for now it would help her feel a little more at peace with it. I do not want her having more to deal with because of her sister while she's already suffering enough.", "Low contact", "Everybody has one, and it's rude to show yours without being asked.", "I love calla lilies and I think it\u2019s a bad name. Sister is the asshole though.", "I'm sorry but from where are you getting that SIL vocalised what everyone was thinking? There is nothing in the post to even remotely indicate that. No discrete nods or approval from the family to what the sister said to indicate stuff. \n\nYou just pulled some baseless assumptions from somewhere and decided that to be the truth and judged according to your assumptions. This is ridiculous. \n\nThere is always the I N F O option if you want further clarification but you just wanted to run with your own assumptions.\n\nAlso, just because the name isn't significant in your culture doesn't mean its common or significant in OP's culture or has a deep meaning to their family. As long as the name is not ridiculous and affects the child in the future, I don't see what's wrong with it and why you are so judgemental about it.", "What everyone will be thinking? I think it's a pretty name. Maybe you're just the SIL who found the post.", ">what everyone was thinking,\n\nNowhere does it say that. \n\nLearn to read properly before commenting", "Because of my wife. I don't want to force her to do anything either and this needs to be her decision as well. I am going to encourage her to take a break until she's feeling better and maybe reevaluate how she feels then. But again, I don't want this to be simply me telling her \"your sister isn't welcome here anymore.\"", "It is! We loved the meaning and for the nature reference too. My wife also adores Calla lilies!! But telling her sister that would be pointless. This woman thinks she's always right and people are dumb when they disagree.", "Since SIL is arrogant and won't listen. Make it simple for her. Tell her to STFU about the name and harassing your wife. If not, a restraining order is next. Maybe she will get the message then.\n\nForgot to add NTA of course and OP is a good man for shutting SIL down.", "NTA, but I would have asked SIL to leave (or asked the hospital staff to tell her to leave) when it was clear she was upsetting your wife.", "You both have higher prioities right now; your beautiful new daughter, and your wife's struggle since her birth.  Her opinion will change nothing.  The baby is Calla, Calla is the baby.  if the name brings you both happiness and joy, a joy you both (esp your wife) need and deserve right now, then fuck SIL.  if she can't handle it, she has a choice to make; do i hate the name soooo much and have to talk about it sooooo much, that I am willing to lose my sister? Because that's the road she's ona nd your wife, you, and little Calla don't have the mental bandwidth for her shit.\n\nGood luck with your little bundle, and I'm rooting for the Mrs to come throught this difficult time as quickly as possible.  You'e got her back- you saw her distress and you made her smile.  Keep protecting her!", "It's just a short version of Callista, which I'm sure you know already, and you may want to inform your sister-in-law of Indiana Jone's wife - Calista Flockhart\n\nCongratualtions on your baby - don't let a spiteful relative ruin it for you. You owned her, and she knows it. \n\nI'm guessing your SIL is childless? Could this be jealousy?\n\n*Personally..*  when picking baby names (done it twice) I like to give them the longer, original version as their official name, then maybe call them by the shorter version. It gives them options in the future.\n\nBut ignore me, go play with your baby girl."]}
