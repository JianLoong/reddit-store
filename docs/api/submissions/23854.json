SIL doesn't respond to people being firm with her,  it appears sarcasm is her kryptonite!   I know it's your wife's family, so it might be hard for you to be the one to lay down rules, but if your wife is half afraid of her, then you might have to be the one who does it, at least until your wife is able. I agree with the other posters saying that you might want to go light to no contact for a while. (Definitely talk it over with your wife first, maybe establish your boundaries as a family.)

And congrats to you for standing up for wife, particularly when she is in a vulnerable state.  When your wife is feeling better, she does need to take her on, and tell her what are appropriate boundaries and what are not.  Your sister in law sounds like she thinks she is the matriarch leader of the family, and is all wrapped up in everyone's business.", "Play stupid game, win stupid prizes.\nYour SIL was told more than once to keep her opinion to herself, but she ignored you and continued.

Sister is the asshole though.", "I'm sorry but from where are you getting that SIL vocalised what everyone was thinking? There is nothing in the post to even remotely indicate that. No discrete nods or approval from the family to what the sister said to indicate stuff. \n\nYou just pulled some baseless assumptions from somewhere and decided that to be the truth and judged according to your assumptions. This is ridiculous. \n\nThere is always the I N F O option if you want further clarification but you just wanted to run with your own assumptions.\n\nAlso, just because the name isn't significant in your culture doesn't mean its common or significant in OP's culture or has a deep meaning to their family. As long as the name is not ridiculous and affects the child in the future, I don't see what's wrong with it and why you are so judgemental about it.", "What everyone will be thinking?

I will always do my best to protect her but that cannot mean making decisions for her. She's an adult after all.", "I think temporary NC is a idea, especially if she's dealing with PPD\n\nAnd who knows, maybe she'll end up feeling liberated and not wanting to go back", "You might want to emphasize to your wife that the most important thing is getting her through the PPD/PPA with as little outside factors to upset her, and hopefully that would convince her on going NC with sister for a while. That\u2019s the most important thing. You\u2019re NTA and SIL honestly sounds like an awful person to be around.", "Just to be safe, and maybe get a few laughs out of your wife, I suggest the two of you plan out a few other responses. I am one that thinks of a better response later, so having a few ready might be helpfull.", "Low contact is ok too.  Slow fade.", "If your wife is up for it, maybe therapy could help her recognize the negative influences in her life and how to handle them. \n\nIf your wife is suffering from PPD/PPA, then a therapist would be a good idea in general. But it could really help her to figure out what voices she should give credence to ad which voices she can brush off.", "When most people share the creative names they've come up with Ill admit I'm a bit judgemental (in my head, they don't need my opinion). But I think Calla is both unique and lovely.", "Calla lilies are some of the most beautiful flowers I know, and the flower I chose for my wedding bouquet. \nAlso, how is Calla any different than other flower-names like Rose, Violet, Lily, etc? \n\nSIL needs to stfu, she has no say in the matter, and if she can't say anything positive, she needs to not say anything at all. \n\nDon't start nothing, won't be nothing. NTA.", "And Calla lillies are supposed to bring luck and happiness as well.", "How lovely, that must smell divine in summer!    I've long toyed with using Lily as a middle name if I ever had a daughter because they're just so beautiful and bright, and the name itself just sounds pleasant to me.\n\nI cannot fathom what SIL's problem is.  I don't love every name my friends/family have chosen for their kids, they might not have been my choice, but I'm not four years old, I'm old enough, mature enough, and ***polite*** enough to realise a)not every thought needs to be spoken and b) its NOT my choice, and that's okay!.  Good for OP standing up for Calla and her mum.  They made a lovely choice, that I suspect, as OP has said that his wife likes calla lilies, has some personal meaning attached.", "Just don't go sniffing a corpse lily. They're pollinated by beetles and the scent that attracts them is not pleasant.", "What about framing it as \u201cI do not want your sister here and I want her to leave, but if you want her to stay, I will defer to you\u201d? As opposed to \u201cjust say the word and she\u2019s gone\u201d - makes the sister GTFO the default plan and takes the onus off of your wife to be the person responsible for her sister being ejected. Maybe this is already your approach, but it is a distinction that can help in a lot of cases. \n\nAlso where are you that Calla is an unusual name?! It\u2019s not super common maybe but where I live, no one would bat an eye at it.", "No. They don't. Not when it's already a done deal. And not to the point that you reduce a new mother to tears. That's just bullying and labouring a point.", "This is a short version of Calista, which I'm sure you already know and you might want to tell your sister-in-law about Calista Flockhart - Indiana Jones' wife.", "A restraining order seems a little extreme.", "Do you know where you are? \n\nI'm surprised the \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 haven't come out in force.", "Maybe, but the threat of it certainly isn't.  SIL is bullying OP's wife.", "The marinara sauce?", "Yup"]}
