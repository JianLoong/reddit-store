I bartended through my first degree at bar/restaurant/pubs and families came in all the time. Now as a mom, we\u2019ve met up with friends and their families and gone to pubs. It\u2019s also common if it\u2019s got outdoor seating to bring the dog as well. There are entire breweries with dog parks here.", "Of course you're American because you think it's a big deal thst there's alcohol in the presence of babies.", "*affects", "I'm sure the mum doesn't expect the bar patrons to be quiet, I feel like OP is making a bigger deal of this than it needs to be.\n\nMy colleague on mat leave brought her baby to a Christmas party at a pub last year. It was at lunch time, but we were in groups and it was pretty easy to avoid being in the group with the baby in it if you wanted.", "My dad\u2019s a college hoops fanatic.  Like, other than a few very lean years, my parents had season tickets.  When I was a baby, they had seats in the very highest seats in the nosebleeds, and there was conveniently just enough room between their seat backs and the wall for a bassinet.  I managed through up to 13k roaring, rowdy fans.\n\nSo unless it\u2019s a fussy baby, I agree with you, the issue will more likely be how the baby changes the adult party rather than the actual baby itself.", "Yeah, you'll be surprised how deeply can babies sleep it's really impressive my niece can be in a totally silent room and she will refuse to sleep BUT just pit her in the stroller and walk around in the streets with all the noice and she will sleep so freaking soundly. \n\nBut who takes a child to something like that honestly, if you don't want to be separated from your baby don't go.\n\nEdit: Niece", "Why am I rude ? Because we (7 of us agreed we don't want the baby there) want to have adult party ? It's working party not a family party.", "This entire thread is why moms feel isolated and unsupported by their community. It makes me sad.", "I\u2019m a mom and I love kids but I don\u2019t want to go drinking with them. If you wana go to a pub with your kid that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t impose it on people who made their own plans. I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s being \u2018annoyed at kids existing around you\u2019.\n\nNot sure how people are AH their preferences regarding drinking around kids.", "Google pub", "OP literally says in the post they are going to drink...", "If the baby is loud, they are limited in their drinking options. Crying baby and no whiskey.", "and her friends are also perfecrly capable of not wanting an infant in a bar. that is not outlandish or assholeish in the least. and i'm not trying to imply that i would find a parent an asshole for wanting to reconnect with friends, chill out, and have a nice dinner. but do i think a bar is a good place for a baby? the answer, for me, is Never. i just don't agree. have a dinner at your own home where you can be around baby and comfort/wear/put them to sleep while also being able to enjoy drinks and dinner. as a parent, if i were planning a night at a bar with my buds and a friend asked to bring their baby, i would respectfully tell them no. i'm very much not a conservative type as a queer nb parent, but seriously, for everyone's sake, No.", "That\u2019s the only takeaway you got? Lol.", "Yeah agreed. Who cares if the baby comes. Be yourself and if the mom is annoying, tell her you specified this was supposed to be an adult party. And if she doesn't get it, next time then tell her no baby.", "My friend\u2019s family owned a pretty well know Jazz bar in our city. When her kids were teething and fussy, she would pop them in to the car and take them to the bar. They would fall asleep to Jazz!\n\nWhen my baby was little, we used to take her to our favorite sports bar when she was fussy. All the lights and noises distracted her and she\u2019d fall asleep.

And this includes babies. \n\nIf she doesn't want to be apart from her baby she should simply not go.", "The problem is that OP didn't say, \"hey, it would ruin the vibe if you brought your baby\". OP said, \"I think it is a bad idea for your baby at the pub because it is a bad environment for them\". The former would be communicating a boundary (a bit exclusive but probably not AH). The latter is telling her how to parent (definitely AH). OP didn't phrase as a concern for the enjoyment for the group, but the suitability of the baby.", "Minors are allowed in pubs, they are not allowed in bars. Pubs have high chairs for babies, bars don't!", "That doesn't mean mom is, though. Kid, even babies, can be around adults drinking.", "why? where? who refuses to serve whiskey to a group containing a baby?\n\nthis sounds like a very location-specific practice", "But she\u2019s a mom. If you want to exclude moms and drop your friends for becoming moms just say so.", "And the group of work colleagues are allowed to want to enjoy drinks together to celebrate/decompress without a baby around.

Pubs in Australia definitely have hard liquor often breweries even stock a small selection of non beer alcoholic  beverages.", "you're just saying random things now, I give up", "So there would be no whiskey even if the baby doesn't come.", "True. It would be great if they could find a place an activity to make their coworker and friend feel more comfortable. This just gets me extra defense, because I have new mom friends and they tell me how many friends drop them and don\u2019t recognize that they need more flexible friends and more support.
