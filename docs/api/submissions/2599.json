We plan to go to a pub around 7 pm, get some beers and so on.\n\nWe made a group chat and started to discuss where to go and what time... the regular. One of our coworkers is friend with coworker on maternity leave so they add her to the chat too. She was happy to come and told us she will attend with her son who is currently 5 months. I told her that I don't think it's good idea to take him with her since we really probably gonna be loud and drinking and he s gonna be crying and it's also kinda late. She told me it's fine and that she is taking him everywhere with her, she even took him to her husband's conference where he has presentation and he didn't cry much. \n\nOthers join me and told her that it's not the best environment for child and if she does not have babysitter we can change to more suitable day. But she said she does not want to be separated from her baby and called us assholes. The only person who took her side was her friend.\n\nSo are we the assholes ?\n\nEdit: Nobody start conversation without her or left her out. The girl who started the chat didn't have her phone number so the friend of hers added her. We intended to invite her all along. \n\nAlso I am on friendly terms with her. I like her. We re work friends I would say. Not hanging out outside of work but before she gave birth we usually took lunches together and went for few conferences together and it was fine and fun.\n\nEdit 2: English isn't my first language so excuse my mistakes. I am not in US, UK or Australia. We live in Europe. \n\nI would also appreciate if people would keep their nasty messages for themselves. Telling me they hope I will kill myself or that I will lose my baby is really fucked up.

Being a baby, there is no worry about running around.

I've watched babies that were criers and some that weren't but they most definitely are not \"**realistic dolls**\". They have needs. The baby could be spoiled and want to be held the entire time. The parents could be the type that do the whole \"shhh the baby's alseep\" which causes loud noise to prevent said baby from sleeping which in turn will make them cry. Which most parent do unfortunately. If she can't leave her 5 month old that's a her problem. She sounds like a future helicopter mom. As a parent you miss out on a lot, and since she doesn't want to leave her baby then that means she misses out on drinking. Which if she's breastfeeding she can't even drink alcohol in the first place, unless she pumps and dumps which means the baby can take a bottle and can be watched by someone else.\n\nShe's being entitled. She didn't organize the event. OP is NTA.", "Lol I wish. My 5 month old is crawling and will of sleep if she\u2019s out in a new place. But still she\u2019s not crying bc it\u2019s loud that\u2019s just ridiculous \ud83e\udd23", "I think there's a rule in Washington State that you can't have someone under 21 in the area where Alcohol is served.  I remember being about 5 and walking through the bar part of a restaurant to get to our reserved table and my parents getting chided for having me in there.  It was for less than 30 seconds, we were just trying to get to the back room.", "you must not frequent the more hipster establishments or breweries. youll see it plenty, but really only during the day, not at night. If it's a \"dog friendly\" place especially", "My parents taught me that it was rude to bring kids out after 8 because other couples paid babysitters to have date nights and they shouldn\u2019t have to listen to kids screaming and crying. Fair point.", "This. Our dude is super chill in most environments but you\u2019ll see ppl with dogs who Cannot Cope with the situation and it\u2019s like - why are you doing that to your dog? Ours loves going out and we still don\u2019t take him places we think would over-stimulate him. (Like I said, he\u2019s very well behaved when we do take him - partly because we don\u2019t take him places where his self-control couldn\u2019t handle it!)", "I disagree, it's one work party.  Just because this mom doesn't want a little adult break away from her child, doesn't mean the rest of the world needs to conform to her desires.  I was a SAHM when mine were little.  If i couldn't get childcare i'd just miss the event.  Having kids comes with planning schedules and parents should be taking some 'me' time occasionally.  That doesn't mean everyone is anti kid, it just means that sometimes they want to socialize without kids and that's okay.", "Well, I'm 41, you impertinent whippersnapper!", "He\u2019s already a little CEO since he did so well at his dad\u2019s conference lol!", "I have a 5 month old, some days when dad gets home I think he's happy he gets to play with dad's beard over me. Yeah no hard feelings dude, I sometimes prefer not getting spit up on every 10 minutes, share the spit up let dad have some too", "I\u2019m from the US and I see kids in pubs all the time. Sometimes late night after they\u2019ve stopped serving food, I think the laws change, but OP is talking about getting together in the early evening. \n\nI\u2019m from the US and think OP has a *huge* stick up their ass.", "I never breastfed either of my kids. I just always knew it wasn't for me. \n\nI knew, in my heart, being attached to my bodys  milk producing schedule would do me in mentally.  I, myself, would never publicly breastfeed or pump which would be detrimental to my social mental health.\n\nI knew it wasn't for me. Those opposed to my decision were top grade, righteous assholes. I just deleted those people from our lives.\n\n20+ years later & no regrets. The kids are healthy and strive for high honors. \n\nAlthough, I have wondered if breastfeed produces kids with a little more common sense.  So, there's that but I know common sense can be taught.", "America claims that all of the other countries breastfeed longer than us", "I had to pump one side at a time because of this, taking up A MORE of my time and my left breast maybe produced drops so I stopped and my right started to get a little bigger than the left! So I had to pump anyway just to keep them the same size.\nYou do whatever you feel is right- keep pumping or stop. Whatever works better for your physical, emotional and mental health. You're still a good mom either way!", "Thank you! He smiled for the first time yesterday... Maybe it's because he got more facetime with me!", "NAH. Some new parents take their young babies to bars and it\u2019s normal. It\u2019s not like a toddler who can run around and grab things\u2014it\u2019s basically a loaf of bread in a carseat. As long as the baby isn\u2019t crying, or is taken out when it is, I don\u2019t see an issue.  However, many people don\u2019t want to hang out with a baby in a bar and that\u2019s also fine.", "If she doesn\u2019t want to separated from her baby, then stay home with him. Problem solved. NTA.", "Why are you going to drag your 5 month old child to a pub at 7pm. Kid should be sleeping and all the noise will wake it up. NTA", "NTA anyone saying Y T A is delusional.", "NAH\nMost of your coworkers do not have e kids, so it makes sense you are unsure of what is appropriate for an infant.\n\nIn the US, it is pretty standard to bring your infant to the office for coworkers to meet right before your maternity ends. So, around 3 months. In NYC, it is not uncommon in a local bar/bar restaurant for someone to bring a single infant, generally from dinner to around 10 pm. Or as long as people are not falling down or fighting, and the baby is happy. Usually, if you have a second child, this becomes harder to manage, as 2 year olds are mobile. So going to a pub around 7, having a beer or two, having everyone meet your child, and then heading home would not be outrageous or imposing on other people's good time.", "NTA Pick a place that doesn't allow babies.", "NTA, unless someone states your child can come you should assume otherwise.", "NAH, but I will say if you don't want her to bring the baby because you don't want any kids there don't say that. Don't try to justify it by saying it will be loud and the baby will cry or other reasons it wouldn't be a good idea for her to bring the baby, she knows her baby better than you do. Our baby never had a problem being out and people loved seeing him there, but if events were no kids we wouldn't bring him. Saying it's no kids changes it from you telling her specifically she can't bring her kid to making it neutral for everyone.", "Did you tell them you didn't want their 1yo to come, or just hope?", "Most babies I\u2019ve come across do not care about noise. At all. I can\u2019t even begin to list the things my daughter slept through as a baby. She had no issues being in extremely loud and crowded places. We just wore her and she slept.", "You should start a global movement.", "This is why I want to be a perinatal mental health counselor. No one talks about the transition from you to mom and how you feel like you lose yourself.", "but the rest of the group don't want the baby there so the mom should read the room, no?", "Wow it's almost like the gathering was planned with the intent of kids being there, so an infant would've hardly made a difference", "I would agree, if the kid was older than five months. You could plan a \u201ckid friendly\u201d party but that baby is still going to be sitting there, not doing much of anything. It\u2019s not really worth it at this stage. I imagine the mom is just saying hello, look at this cute guy, then leaving. Judging by all my friends with babies, she is exhausted.", "I can't even begin to tell you how many KITCHENS we've been walked through in WA to avoid the bar. \n\n\nIs walking on a greasy, slippery floor past the open flames of the commercial stoves and ovens REALLY safer for a child than a 30 seconds through the bar to the seating area?", "This is very generous of you. You are a good person\ud83d\ude09"]}
