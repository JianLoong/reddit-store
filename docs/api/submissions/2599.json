One of our coworkers is friend with coworker on maternity leave so they add her to the chat too. She was happy to come and told us she will attend with her son whom is currently 5 months. I told her that I don't think it's good idea to take him with her since we really probably gonna be loud and drinking and he s gonna be crying and it's also kinda late. She told me it's fine and that she is taking him everywhere with her, she even took him to her husband's conference where he has presentation and he didn't cry much. \n\nOthers join me and told her that it's not the best environment for child and if she does not have babysitter we can change to more suitable day. But she said she does not want to be separated from her baby and called us assholes. The only person who took her side was her friend.\n\nSo are we the assholes ?\n\nEdit: Nobody start conversation without her or left her out. The girl who started the chat didn't have her phone number so the friend of hers added her. We intended to invite her all along. \n\nAlso I am on friendly terms with her. I like her.

Yes, the whole world isn't child- and baby-free, yet there are some spaces that are.", "Careful, your ignorance is showing. A 5 month old baby is basically an extension of the parent at this point. They rely on you for everything; food, water, even getting to sleep. By excluding a child this young, especially a nursing baby, you are excluding the mother. Btw, your restrictions for breastfeeding women are super weird- we can totally drink and have sex, and I\u2019m not aware of a specific medication I should be taking other than vitamins! \ud83d\ude02", ">\ta child IS a person, not an accessory \n\n\nWhat are you talking about? Nobody is acting like she wants the baby there to complete her outfit.\n\nYou are excluding her individually by telling her the baby can\u2019t come, if it\u2019s not possible for her to leave the child. As I keep mentioning, what if baby doesn\u2019t take bottles and needs nursing? \n\nWhat a sad view, it\u2019s literally our most basic human instinct to procreate, but because woman do the physical job of growing the child and nursing, we get punished by people like you. \n\nI assume you are quite young judging by your comments, maybe once you grow older you will mature and understand.", "The mother can't take a damn hint.  Next time, the coworkers should just say, \"we don't want your child here.\"  Would that be better?", "Sorry that reality doesn't work like you want. Yes, sometimes you can't come to places because you have a child. It's not punishment, it's just one of the things that happen when you have someone under your care and they aren't capable of caring for themselves. She could have a mother with dementia that needs constant care. Should she be brought to the meeting anyway? Nope, if she's not invited. And nope, that's not different. That could be with any living creature that is unable to function on their own. They aren't entitled to ALL the spaces still. Yep, you make sacrifices when you have to care for someone 24/7, yet it's not others' faults nor responsibility"]}
