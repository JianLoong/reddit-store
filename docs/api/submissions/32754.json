Even if he said make yourself at home you should know to be reasonable and respectful. \nIf you know nothing about wine you shouldn\u2019t have opened anything or at the very least googled prices of the bottles you were considering opening.

Get him a nice bottle of wine and just say \u201cmy bad I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Speaking from experience as a brother who is seven years older, I\u2019ve come to expect a little that my younger sibling isn\u2019t going to be financially in the same place I am, so the bottle doesn\u2019t have to be as expensive, but the gesture of taking responsibility will be appreciated.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough info here for a definitive judgment.

He should know by now that many kinds of wine are really expensive, and he should\u2019ve asked first or looked it up on Google\n\nOP's brother told him to make himself at home. OP's brother should've Googled what that means.", "I think it's totally fine to drink someone's alcohol in the situation, but you don't open a bottle and your don't finish a bottle.", ">It means that OP is happy to do it as a favour because it benefits him.\n\nExactly, so they don't ***deserve***  anything extra at all", "Say you also dont know the difference between cracking a cold one and opening somebody *else\u00b4s* Rothschild for example.\n\nJk. I think.\n\nSure, the owner was an idiot for not specifying to a 23 yold to stay away from the wine. But he was hospitable. Thats not up for debate. \n\nThat said, OP is definitely the AH. Even if you dont know wine, you *do* know that wine can be expensive. Thats a particular item you never open without asking the owners. Or rather, you dont even touch the wine if you dont own it. \n\nNot getting this, seems borderline malicious incompetence. He should pay it back.", "Would it be OK for OP to have sex with his brothers wife too I mean he didn't say not to, he said help yourself.", "I\u2019m talking about the post. I don\u2019t know you or your life.  You may be reading a smidge more into this - OP is clearly still talking to his brother.", "How old are you? It\u2019s a common courtesy for an adult to grab a beer from the fridge, let alone wine from a wine rack. \n\nAnd OP sucks anyway for not offering to replace the wine. That\u2019s another basic human curtesy", "I agree. If it\u2019s one that\u2019s like half full then you can tell it\u2019s commonly drank from. But if it\u2019s unopened or almost empty you should always ask as a given.\n\nMy thing is you should always ask anyways. If you didn\u2019t buy it, just assume it\u2019s expensive and ask the owner before opening it", "Just because OP decides not to ask for compensation doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t objectively deserve it", "Is he didn\u2019t know it was his wife, sure. That\u2019s on the wife to make it known.", "Ok. So what to do?  If u can\u2019t afford expensive wine u can afford intelligent conversation most of the time. These people went hk college I assume and he let his young bro take his house. Hide the Johnny blue and the good wine\u2026 it\u2019s not undulating unless their situation occurs.", "40. My sister watched our place a few months ago, we literally stocked extra wine for her...\n\nLOL, downvoted for buying my sister wine to enjoy while she housesits. Reddit, never change.", "I going to mark this down to a difference in socio-economic backgrounds because we are clearly from different worlds with different standards", "Eek, this reads like you got into the wine and the Johnny walker\u2026", "My god. If that\u2019s how you want your relationships to be then fine.\n\nBut OP should be offering to replace the wine. It\u2019s just simply the decent thing to do, since it obviously meant something to his brother.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter the situation, it\u2019s called being kind", "I really don\u2019t understand your logic. You make it sound like the dude was like, shit this looks expensive i I\u2019m going to help myself. Sounds like the brother kept all his shit together, expensive or not. Didn\u2019t set any expectations and if I was ops brother I would chock this up to lesson learned\u2026 you\u2019ve obviously never managed people. If you don\u2019t have thorough instructions, you give opportunity for error. You shouldn\u2019t assume anyone just magically knows something. If something is important it\u2019s best to make it known.", ">My god.\n\nMy God, what? What flabbergasted you here? Our willingness to extend... alcohol to my family member? \n\n>But OP should be offering to replace the wine. It\u2019s just simply the decent thing to do, since it obviously meant something to his brother.\n\nWhy is it incumbent on OP when OP's brother was the one that instructed him incorrectly? \n\nLet's say my boss told me to do something, I do it, then he realizes he didn't want me to do it - you're saying I should apologize and compensate my boss."]}
