Just having that story to tell made it worth it.", "YTA\n\n\"Help yourself\" doesn't mean you're welcome to open their liquor or wine. It would have taken 2 seconds to check online.", "I'll give you the benefit of a doubt that it was an honest mistake. On both sides. A mistake on your part to assume that you could have wine that is usually expensive and a mistake on his part not specifying boundaries. But mistakes carry consequences. I think you need to make at least an offer to compensate for the wine if you can.", "YTA if you didn\u2019t replace it.

Since you had no idea it was cheap or expensive, you should have asked. Help yourself isn't an open invitation to everything in the house. Would you have  gone into the freezer and thawed an expensive steak? You know there are reasonable limitations to the phrase \"help yourself.\"", "YTA. If he wanted you to actually have everything he'd say so. One time i was looking at someone's house and they told me to help myself with everything and they opened the liquor cabinet and said \"here's the alcohol, you can drink everything you like.\" I actually had some more alcohol than i probably should have, but I went to the shop and replaced it (I was there for 3 weeks). You should 100% at least offer to replace it", "YTA\n\nIf you don't know about wine, you know google is free, right?\n\nBut what makes you the actual ah is you still haven't offered to replace it. \n\nYou didn't know, sure not everyone knows everything. You didn't think to ask, eh depends on your relationship with your brother. You didn't bother to look it up, getting into ah territory.\n\nBut you now know you messed up, didn't even apologize, and then excused all of your behavior with \"I didn't know\" and \"he said I could help myself\". \n\nActually apologize for your mistake, then offer to replace the bottle.", "You should replace it.

So it would depend on his family. \n\nIn my family if someone used the words OP wrote, we'd totally be drinking some of the alcohol. Equally, we'd also be replacing what we drank before they came back with something we considered to be similar. If we knew nothing about wine, we'd could end up replacing a $100 bottle of wine with a $20 bottle of wine without having any idea that we actually drank expensive stuff. \n\nThe fact that OP's brother mentioned the wine in the way he did means that OP should be offering, and insisting, to replace the wine. Anything less than that make OP a very firm YTA.\n\nIf OP replaces the wine, then it's just a simple misunderstanding.", "For people like you they invented the app Vivino.

You have a phone, man, google the label before you pop a cork. \n\nBuy them a nice equivalent bottle at the next gift-giving opportunity.", "YTA. This falls under common sense. Foods and snacks are perishable, when you start getting into the stuff that can keep for a decade or is used for a celebration you should ask yourself \"would I want someone rummaging around in this if it were mine?\".

You wanted some wine and now you don't want to feel bad about it, pay for it or you're the asshole, also I'm guessing $100 is worth less than your relationship with your brother, food for thought.", "YTA.", "I was going to say NTA but a very stupid mistake UNTIL I read that you didn't offer to replace it and still don't see why you should.

You should be extra considerate about expensive things just to be courteous and avoid these situations.\n\nIf I were you I would give him an apology and if the wine wasn\u2019t insanely expensive offer to pay half towards replacing it. While convenient, you were still doing them a favor so half the bottle could be considered compensation. If the wine was ridiculously expensive then they should have done what a lot of people do and separate that wine from the rest of the alcohol or specify it\u2019s off limits to guests and family when they give a blanket statement of \u201chelp yourself\u201d.", "YTA-You took advantage but sounds like you two will be fine.", "NTA\n\nI actually don\u2019t think he\u2019s pissed at you though.  \n\nI think he\u2019s mad at himself bc, like you said, he didn\u2019t specify that you couldn\u2019t help yourself to wine so it was reasonable for you to expect that nothing was off limits considering he litterally said to help yourself to anything you want.\n\nIt was an oversight on his part that caused this and I think he knows it.", "NTA. You didn't know. But if you want to smooth it over, buy him a nice bottle of wine to replace it.", "Apologize for the miscommunication. It was a 50/50 blame but do it anyway. Then offer to pay for half the value of the bottle. And do it if he accepts. How much are you talking about? $30 buys a really good bottle of wine. Anything over $50 is collector's stuff.

I asked for permission to stay each weekend at the rental and got approved. While I was staying I drank 3 bottles of wine over the entire period.

Either way NTA, you didn't charge them, so that is the cost of having you house sit for them.", "NAH you were doing them a favor, and he didn't specify, but probably should have asked first.

Even if he said make yourself at home you should know to be reasonable and respectful. \nIf you know nothing about wine you shouldn\u2019t have opened anything or at the very least googled prices of the bottles you were considering opening. The overwhelming majority of people have phones with internet access. It just sounds like you were making yourself too comfortable and being inconsiderate.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t know and your brother has already said to forget about it. That being said, you are an adult now. Is this how you want to be interacting with your brother? Get him a nice bottle of wine and just say \u201cmy bad I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Speaking from experience as a brother who is seven years older, I\u2019ve come to expect a little that my younger sibling isn\u2019t going to be financially in the same place I am, so the bottle doesn\u2019t have to be as expensive, but the gesture of taking responsibility will be appreciated.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough info here for a definitive judgment. Was the wine in open view in the kitchen, or in the back of a closed liquor cabinet? Was it among a dozen bottles or the only one there? Basically - could one reasonably assume it was an option or off limits? \n\nI also think the fact it\u2019s his brother makes a huge difference. I wouldn\u2019t drink wine if I was housesitting for an acquaintance, but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate if I was housesitting for my sister, had she said I was welcome to whatever I wanted and not explicitly told me there were exceptions. (Granted, I know nothing about the brothers\u2019 relationship and am only speaking from my own experience.) \n\nI think offering to either replace or assist with replacing the wine is essential here. Your brother should not have to ask for you to do this, for you to do this.

It\u2019s your brother, not a friend. You saved them a lot of money by watching their dog. Did the wine cost more than hiring a dog sitter? If my brother did me a favor and drank something expensive I wouldn\u2019t make him feel bad for it. If I had a 5 billion dollar of wine I would maybe put it somewhere out of sight. I don\u2019t know, people sound so formal with their siblings.", "YTA Google is free, you need to replace it for them", "NTA and check what it would have cost him to hire a professional sitter in your location for the days he was gone, including tip.

If I were you I would have at least googled the name to see if it came up as \u00a320 or \u00a3500, if I were him I would have said 'help yourself but don't touch the wine' my parents occasionally have friends house sit and always say 'help yourselves but not the bottles in the utility room/bottom rack', they'll then even specifically put an assortment of cheaper stuff in the fridge and if they have some really special/expensive bottles hide them somewhere else because mix ups happen. \nMost comments seem to say that you should pay for it but honestly i'd be a bit miffed if I ended up forking out a few hundred \u00a3 out of pocket because my brother didn't warn me off something after saying help yourself but at the same time it's probably the right gesture to make... and hope they don't take you up on it", "YTA - Look at the bright side though.\n\nNow you don't have to ask him what he want's for Xmas.", "Your brothers the asshole here.
