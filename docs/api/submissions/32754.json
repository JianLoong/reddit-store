Even if he said make yourself at home you should know to be reasonable and respectful. \nIf you know nothing about wine you shouldn\u2019t have opened anything or at the very least googled prices of the bottles you were considering opening.

Get him a nice bottle of wine and just say \u201cmy bad I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Speaking from experience as a brother who is seven years older, I\u2019ve come to expect a little that my younger sibling isn\u2019t going to be financially in the same place I am, so the bottle doesn\u2019t have to be as expensive, but the gesture of taking responsibility will be appreciated.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough info here for a definitive judgment.

You should know that those things can be very expensive, and since you can't tell the difference, why risk it?", "NTA at all, but lesson learned.\n\nI have friends with pets. Finding a reliable pet sitter is incredibly hard, and boarding two dogs can cost $100/night. Your brother is incredibly fortunate that you're nearby and willing to provide this service for him for free. The fact that it benefits YOU doesn't change that fact. You would happily live in your own apt - you're still disrupting your routine to do him a favor bc you like him and his dogs.\n\nHe also didn't specify what you could or couldn't drink. I think it's absolutely absurd of him to make a fuss about you drinking the wine, on any level. IF the wine was >$1000, then next time you come over, he can specify \"hey not these bottles.\" That's on HIM. I have a few friends who own wine in that type of price range, and they would NEVER tell a pet sitter to help themselves without specifying which wine fridges are off limits. NOW, from a reasonable adult perspective, I will say that if you're pulling wine from the bottom rack of a well-stocked fridge, it might make sense to ask bc some folks genuinely DO have very pricey wine lying around. It's totally reasonable to ask, and it's not a bad idea for you to do that moving forward.\n\nBut in this case: it's fine for him to ask if you drank it, fine for you to say \"oops my bad, I totally did\" and then he should say \"no worries, thanks for sitting the dogs\" and next time you come over, he can lock up the heirloom bottles beforehand. It sounds like that's what he's doing, so I'd just take it at face value OP and let him get over it.", "technically help yourself to anything means help yourself to anything. IF the brother had expensive beverages he was keen on saving. he could have written a note or specified otherwise.
