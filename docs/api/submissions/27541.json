I had already been bullied into doing it for free by him and our mom just because he\u2019s family, even though I babysat for a living at that point and had even been a nanny for a while. It\u2019s not like I was going to ask for my full rate or something, but sacrificing my night (and potential PAID babysitting gig) so he could enjoy his without any kind of compensation was annoying. That\u2019s not the issue though, I agreed to do it as a favor.\n\nLong story short, his son (was about 4-5 at the time) was being an absolute TERROR, despite me engaging him with activities we could do together, fun kids shows he picked out, games, so on and so forth. He just decided to shut down and stop listening and kept throwing things. I would firmly tell him no, put whatever he threw out of his reach, and try to explain that we don\u2019t throw things and if he wanted to play or do something else we could figure out something new.\n\nNot 10 seconds would pass before he would grab something else and throw it (often in my direction). This went on for about 20 minutes before I gave up and said alright, if you can\u2019t behave and play nicely, then you can\u2019t play at all. I picked up everything and put it all away. There was only about 5-10 minutes left before my brother was supposed to get there anyways. So, I put a chair in the corner and put him in time out. He screamed and cried and threw a fit but stayed in the chair and I simply ignored him. He was still crying when my brother arrived.\n\nWhen I tell you my brother LOST. HIS. MIND over me putting his son in timeout for misbehaving\u2026 he yelled at me about how his kids weren\u2019t going to like me. I told him that was fine, I didn\u2019t need them to like me, I needed them to respect me if they were ever to be in my care. He continued to berate me until I finally told him my services would no longer be available to him and to find someone else, since he clearly wanted some pushover doormat for his kids to walk all over and that wasn\u2019t me.\n\nI never babysat for him again. That was his oldest son who is currently 13 and he has 5 kids now. The youngest is about 4, but I still refuse to watch any of his children. \n\nRecently, we got in a pretty big fight because he couldn\u2019t find a babysitter and just because I was technically available (I\u2019m disabled and work from home) I reminded him that I will not be watching any of his kids due to the event described above. He was livid that I would still refuse based on something that happened so long ago and idk if I\u2019m being unreasonable or if I should let it go by now\u2026 so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1695570343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r0wgi/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_brothers_kids/", "score": 577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Learned behaviors for sure.", "Instead he just married someone (2 kids from previous marriage and 3 from current) and has her stay at home but then they barely get to do anything together without the kids. In my opinion, he abuses our moms kindness and has her watch them way too often.", "He has a wife that stays home with them, the 13yr old and the I think 10-11yr old are both from a previous marriage so they typically pawn them off on the ex\u2019s father and then pawn the rest on our mom but my mom was out of town so he thought since I stay at home anyways I should just be willing to do it because I\u2019m their aunt\u2026 and I said nope.", "Yes!!

I don\u2019t anymore, but that still shouldn\u2019t entitle him to just employing me for free whenever he decides he wants to do something and not pay for a sitter.

I\u2019m also 5\u20190 and have mobility limitations so it would be so incredibly overwhelming.

To hate to them but idk how they keep their sanity. More structure is definitely needed in those kids\u2019 lives.", "He has the same attitude. I reverted to my instincts and grabbed one of his kids hands and said no very firmly when they were about to grab a fork. This was at a family gathering so he was there. They were super little and I didn\u2019t want them to poke themselves. He still told me I should\u2019ve just told him and let him handle it. But a lot can happen in that 30 seconds. I\u2019m not some overbearing b!tch that doesn\u2019t let kids be kids, but I try at least to encourage healthy and safe activities and apparently that means I\u2019m not letting them just express themselves how they see fit.", "I expressed my concerns with the recent event and that\u2019s when we got into a fight because he thought it was ridiculous I was still trying to implement the same ideologies as years ago, even though his stance on it hasn\u2019t changed and I just refuse to put myself in that situation if he won\u2019t respect me being allowed to (gently) discipline them or the fact that I shouldn\u2019t be expected to do it for free all the time.", "Has he apologised for his appalling behaviour? If not, why would you forget it? He'll just do the same and there are many more kids involved now.", "You're not though. Stay firm.", "Have you told him this is your concern?  And if he were to agree to your ground rules would you accept?", "You have done nothing wrong. Kids need to hear the word \"no\" and they need boundaries.

And good luck to him if he's raising all  his children without consequences for their behavior.", "Are teachers allowed to discipline them?

He's stopping you, but you can bet they get discipline from teachers, etc.", "It's not like you were giving punishments which last weeks. Of course any long-term consequences have to be decided by a parent, but a sitter needs ways to discipline kids during the time the babysitting is happening. You did nothing wrong, and your brother insists on the terms which aren't realistic.\n\nIf he still nags you, and you do genuinely want to help, ask him which discipline methods he finds acceptable for a babysitter. Don't suggest any, just ask an open-ended question. His answer will show you if your brother has changed (he just might have, having raised all these kids). If he didn't change, then your answer also does not.", "but he hasn't changed the problem, so it's NOT a past problem it's a current problem.\n\nSay you are babysitting and the 13 lights up a cigarette or vape device.

Let them drink??? \n\nYou cannot take care of these kids because you are NOT allowed to care for them responsibly.,", "That right there is reason enough.

Or does she have to allow them to run wild?", "It\u2019s more than fair not to want to work for free, deal with a poorly behaved child and then get verbally accosted after dealing with said child appropriately. \n\nRespecting yourself and your boundaries is most important.", "There\u2019s a difference between spending time with them and people assuming you\u2019re free help. You\u2019re not a pack mule or a servant or a minivan. You don\u2019t exist just to help. And just because you don\u2019t have kids doesn\u2019t mean you want to babysit for free. \n\nLook up how much childcare costs in your area. Multiply it by five, add a little for gas and their behavior, and give him an invoice. Tell him you\u2019ll be happy to babysit if he coughs up the money. Bet he won\u2019t.", "Well I already thought you're NTA, but I mean this just solidifies it. \n\nHonestly I think your OP gives too much weight to the thing with your nephew. That's a symptom of the fundamental problem, which is your brother being a giant choosey beggar. He wants/demands your help with free childcare, but thinks he can dictate all the terms. \n\nIt's his right as a parent to choose how to discipline his children (no matter how questionable), but he's fucking high if he thinks he can force babysitting on you, and tell you how to do it. What a dick.", "He has not. He still thinks I was the one that was out of line.", "I have told him that I wouldn\u2019t know how to react in a more emergent situation and felt uncomfortable caring for them.

He was there and when his kid ran to him crying because I scolded them, I told him why I did it and he still said I should\u2019ve let him handle it.\n\nI would absolutely help out sometimes if he agreed to my ground rules\u2026 but I still feel it\u2019s unreasonable to expect me to help (especially when he typically plans things last minute) just because I\u2019m home (I\u2019m disabled) and expect it to be for free because \u201cI\u2019m their aunt and should want to spend time with them\u201d.

She just kind of lets them do whatever and when they\u2019re bad she kind of makes it a joke and then just rides it out. I feel bad for her.

Idk why he doesn\u2019t value my time or my boundaries. He\u2019s always been a \u201cdifficult\u201d person.

If you ate so wrong for your actions then why would he want you watching them?\n\nFYI, I think you did the right thing.", "Thats a ridiculous attitude to have with a 5 year old throwing a tantrum. They need adult intervention and consequences. He just expects everyone who watches his kids to put up with crap behavior? Sounds like crap parenting to me.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want to pay for a sitter and thinks I should just do it for free and abide by his rules but I can\u2019t agree to that. I\u2019d feel so powerless to take charge of any situation that got out of control.", "He wanted me to just ride it out then let him handle it when he got there to pick him up. I took child development courses. Kids get very overwhelmed with their emotions and often need help processing them or at least containing them and educating to what is okay and what is not. They need structure. I just can\u2019t agree to watch them with no set boundaries.", "Yeah I volunteered in preschool for social and emotional needs and just figuring out strategies with my own kid. I doubt your brother does a lot in the parenting department because what you're doing is standard stuff.

My guess is about the same as when you disciplined his kid.", "NTA. The event maybe happened one million years ago, but you don't have any reassurance about brother's mindset having changed through the years, so the event is actually present, every one of his kids can be a trouble and you have no right to discipline them.

I don't have kids or babysit/nanny, but I do work in education at the teenager level and I see the results of young children who were not taught to respect authority figures outside of their parents, and deal with \"you can't discipline my child!\" parents every year- and discipline at our campus is usually behavioral intervention and not actual punishment. It's frustrating to deal with at the high school level, I imagine it's incredibly frustrating to deal with regarding small children because you can't explain it to their raging toddler brains quite the same way. \n\nHold strong, don't give in... He can pay for a normal sitter. Also, I remember doing some babysitting at the age of 12 until about 14 when I realized I didn't enjoy it- didn't you say in your post that the eldest is now 13?

You're never a bad person for standing up for yourself, & creating boundaries.", "I mean that's so stupid of him, not allowing a babysitter to use basic discipline even in the moment. Just ridiculous. There are levels of discipline that it might make sense for only the parent to be allowed to impose but those are higher levels, not a simple time-out for obvious bad behavior.\n\nEver since watching a rather silly cartoon with this theme, I mentally call it \"babysitting the prince.\" It actually goes for any situation where you're considered responsible for making sure all goes well but aren't given the authority to ensure that, but it almost becomes literal when babysitting a child you're not allowed to draw boundaries with. Babysitting the prince is incredibly stressful, b/c the whole time you're wondering what you'll do if said prince decides this is a good day to jump off the roof to see if he can fly. You're not allowed to tell him no!! Good luck!! :)\n\nI don't allow myself to be put in that situation now that I have a say in it, and you're right not to do so with your brother's kids.

I told her I didn't give a shit what she thought. If the brat misbehaved in my house and neither mom nor dad disciplined her, then I would. If that wasn't acceptable, they could keep the brat at home.", "Your brother isn\u2019t great about boundaries from the sounds of it so why would his kids be?

Even if it\u2019s not babysitting all 5 for your bother at once but what about outings or fun sleepovers as individuals. Especially when there are 5 kids in a house they don\u2019t get much attention and would probably love getting to spend time away from their siblings and get to build a relationship with their aunt.
