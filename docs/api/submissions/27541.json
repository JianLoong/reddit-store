I had already been bullied into doing it for free by him and our mom just because he\u2019s family, even though I babysat for a living at that point and had even been a nanny for a while. It\u2019s not like I was going to ask for my full rate or something, but sacrificing my night (and potential PAID babysitting gig) so he could enjoy his without any kind of compensation was annoying. That\u2019s not the issue though, I agreed to do it as a favor.\n\nLong story short, his son (was about 4-5 at the time) was being an absolute TERROR, despite me engaging him with activities we could do together, fun kids shows he picked out, games, so on and so forth. He just decided to shut down and stop listening and kept throwing things. I would firmly tell him no, put whatever he threw out of his reach, and try to explain that we don\u2019t throw things and if he wanted to play or do something else we could figure out something new.\n\nNot 10 seconds would pass before he would grab something else and throw it (often in my direction). This went on for about 20 minutes before I gave up and said alright, if you can\u2019t behave and play nicely, then you can\u2019t play at all. I picked up everything and put it all away. There was only about 5-10 minutes left before my brother was supposed to get there anyways. So, I put a chair in the corner and put him in time out. He screamed and cried and threw a fit but stayed in the chair and I simply ignored him. He was still crying when my brother arrived.\n\nWhen I tell you my brother LOST. HIS. MIND over me putting his son in timeout for misbehaving\u2026 he yelled at me about how his kids weren\u2019t going to like me. I told him that was fine, I didn\u2019t need them to like me, I needed them to respect me if they were ever to be in my care. He continued to berate me until I finally told him my services would no longer be available to him and to find someone else, since he clearly wanted some pushover doormat for his kids to walk all over and that wasn\u2019t me.\n\nI never babysat for him again. That was his oldest son who is currently 13 and he has 5 kids now. The youngest is about 4, but I still refuse to watch any of his children. \n\nRecently, we got in a pretty big fight because he couldn\u2019t find a babysitter and just because I was technically available (I\u2019m disabled and work from home) I reminded him that I will not be watching any of his kids due to the event described above. He was livid that I would still refuse based on something that happened so long ago and idk if I\u2019m being unreasonable or if I should let it go by now\u2026 so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1695570343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r0wgi/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_brothers_kids/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless you have very good reason to believe he has actually learned to discipline his children and taught them to listen to their caregivers, you should never agree to watch his children.

His kids probably haven\u2019t had the boundaries established and the oldest is bigger now.", "NTA. I highly doubt his parenting techniques have changed.

It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love his kids\u2026 but feeling like I can\u2019t discipline them if necessary just takes away any desire to be alone with them ever. I hate that it still causes tension but you\u2019re right, he\u2019s still the same.", "Thank you\u2026 I know he feels like the discipline should be left to him as the parent\u2026 but what am I supposed to do in those situations then? What if they were doing something where they accidentally harmed themselves? I\u2019d be the asshole in his eyes again because I let it happen.

Maybe I am the asshole for not letting it go naturally, but I\u2019m conflicted with how I would handle his kids misbehaving since it\u2019s never been discussed and when it was he expected me to just wait and let him handle it. That just doesn\u2019t seem like a viable option.", "I even took some child development courses in college. I tried so hard to make the experience positive and engage and enrich them but if they misbehave and I\u2019m not allowed to do anything\u2026 what happens next. I feel bad that I don\u2019t spend time with the kiddos one on one but it honestly gives me anxiety thinking that they could do something bad and maybe hurt themselves and then it would be my fault for NOT stopping them so I just choose to not be involved in their care at all.", "I love my brother, but he definitely didn\u2019t need 5 kids\u2026.", "Yep. NTA.", "My brother is 7 years older than me but he honestly acts like a child sometimes. He gets very stubborn and refuses to budge if he\u2019s convinced he\u2019s right no matter how much opposing evidence is provided. He\u2019s a very frustrating human being to converse with, especially when he drinks. He gets belligerent. Learned behaviors for sure.", "Instead he just married someone (2 kids from previous marriage and 3 from current) and has her stay at home but then they barely get to do anything together without the kids. In my opinion, he abuses our moms kindness and has her watch them way too often.", "He has a wife that stays home with them, the 13yr old and the I think 10-11yr old are both from a previous marriage so they typically pawn them off on the ex\u2019s father and then pawn the rest on our mom but my mom was out of town so he thought since I stay at home anyways I should just be willing to do it because I\u2019m their aunt\u2026 and I said nope.", "Yes!! And I WAS a nanny and babysat for my income at that time. I don\u2019t anymore, but that still shouldn\u2019t entitle him to just employing me for free whenever he decides he wants to do something and not pay for a sitter. I honestly was struggling feeling like I was just being an asshole but these comments are making me feel better knowing that I shouldn\u2019t have to compromise my boundaries.", "These particular times were when my parents were unavailable for one reason or another. The more recent time, they were out of town. I didn\u2019t want to be unreasonable or rude but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable after the last time.", "He just thinks I\u2019m being unreasonable and don\u2019t care about his kids liking me. Which is kind of true. I don\u2019t care if ANYONE likes me if they\u2019re going to disrespect me. His 5 kids vary in ages and seem to do okay at school, for the most part\u2026 but his attitude with babysitters hasn\u2019t changed so I\u2019m hesitant to ever give that another chance.", "I know he works hard but my goodness that man is the most stubborn human I\u2019ve ever encountered.

I love my nieces and nephews but I cannot in good conscience watch them if I cannot control them.", "I\u2019m also 5\u20190. My nephew towers over me and most of the others are either close to my size or barely shorter.", "Thank you. I often get singled out to be the free helper because I also don\u2019t have any kids. I\u2019m also 5\u20190 and have mobility limitations so it would be so incredibly overwhelming. I felt bad saying no because he goes straight for the guilt trip of \u201cyou\u2019re their aunt, why don\u2019t you want to spend time with them?\u201d", "I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I was doing something wrong. He has a habit of gaslighting you and making everything your fault somehow and I was really doubting myself on this one. Thank you.", "Their house is often complete chaos. To hate to them but idk how they keep their sanity. More structure is definitely needed in those kids\u2019 lives.", "He has the same attitude. I reverted to my instincts and grabbed one of his kids hands and said no very firmly when they were about to grab a fork. This was at a family gathering so he was there. They were super little and I didn\u2019t want them to poke themselves. He still told me I should\u2019ve just told him and let him handle it. But a lot can happen in that 30 seconds. I\u2019m not some overbearing b!tch that doesn\u2019t let kids be kids, but I try at least to encourage healthy and safe activities and apparently that means I\u2019m not letting them just express themselves how they see fit.", "I expressed my concerns with the recent event and that\u2019s when we got into a fight because he thought it was ridiculous I was still trying to implement the same ideologies as years ago, even though his stance on it hasn\u2019t changed and I just refuse to put myself in that situation if he won\u2019t respect me being allowed to (gently) discipline them or the fact that I shouldn\u2019t be expected to do it for free all the time.", "Has he apologised for his appalling behaviour? If not, why would you forget it? He'll just do the same and there are many more kids involved now.", "You're not though. Stay firm.", "Have you told him this is your concern?  And if he were to agree to your ground rules would you accept?", "You have done nothing wrong. Kids need to hear the word \"no\" and they need boundaries. Time-outs are a great strategy when they are continuously misbehaving. Your brother was out of line. And good luck to him if he's raising all  his children without consequences for their behavior.", "Are teachers allowed to discipline them?  Daycare provider for 4 yr old(or others when younger)?  \nThis is really BS on his part.  He's stopping you, but you can bet they get discipline from teachers, etc.", "It's not like you were giving punishments which last weeks. Of course any long-term consequences have to be decided by a parent, but a sitter needs ways to discipline kids during the time the babysitting is happening. You did nothing wrong, and your brother insists on the terms which aren't realistic.\n\nIf he still nags you, and you do genuinely want to help, ask him which discipline methods he finds acceptable for a babysitter. Don't suggest any, just ask an open-ended question. His answer will show you if your brother has changed (he just might have, having raised all these kids). If he didn't change, then your answer also does not.", "but he hasn't changed the problem, so it's NOT a past problem it's a current problem.\n\nSay you are babysitting and the 13 lights up a cigarette or vape device.  Do you stop child or let them do it until parents get home?\n\nWhat if they bring out a bottle of wine/beer?  Let them drink??? \n\nYou cannot take care of these kids because you are NOT allowed to care for them responsibly.,", "That right there is reason enough. If you cannot set reasonable boundaries that are for the safety of everyone involved, you cannot babysit. There\u2019s no ifs, ands, or buts about it.", "Your right it\u2019s not a viable option as by the time he gets home the kid will of thought it was sorted and not understand why he\u2019s now getting shouted at", "Is your Mom allowed to discipline them?  Or does she have to allow them to run wild?", "It\u2019s more than fair not to want to work for free, deal with a poorly behaved child and then get verbally accosted after dealing with said child appropriately. \n\nRespecting yourself and your boundaries is most important.", "There\u2019s a difference between spending time with them and people assuming you\u2019re free help. You\u2019re not a pack mule or a servant or a minivan. You don\u2019t exist just to help. And just because you don\u2019t have kids doesn\u2019t mean you want to babysit for free. \n\nLook up how much childcare costs in your area. Multiply it by five, add a little for gas and their behavior, and give him an invoice. Tell him you\u2019ll be happy to babysit if he coughs up the money. Bet he won\u2019t.", "Well I already thought you're NTA, but I mean this just solidifies it. \n\nHonestly I think your OP gives too much weight to the thing with your nephew. That's a symptom of the fundamental problem, which is your brother being a giant choosey beggar. He wants/demands your help with free childcare, but thinks he can dictate all the terms. \n\nIt's his right as a parent to choose how to discipline his children (no matter how questionable), but he's fucking high if he thinks he can force babysitting on you, and tell you how to do it. What a dick.", "He has not. He still thinks I was the one that was out of line.", "I have told him that I wouldn\u2019t know how to react in a more emergent situation and felt uncomfortable caring for them. In another comment I mentioned there was another instance where we were at a family gathering and I grabbed one of his younger kids hands and said \u201cno\u201d firmly because they were about to grab a metal fork and I was worried they\u2019d poke themselves. He was there and when his kid ran to him crying because I scolded them, I told him why I did it and he still said I should\u2019ve let him handle it.\n\nI would absolutely help out sometimes if he agreed to my ground rules\u2026 but I still feel it\u2019s unreasonable to expect me to help (especially when he typically plans things last minute) just because I\u2019m home (I\u2019m disabled) and expect it to be for free because \u201cI\u2019m their aunt and should want to spend time with them\u201d. He\u2019s very *guilt trip-y*", "He\u2019s allowed to discipline them, but only him/his wife. I\u2019m not their parent so apparently that gives me no right to stand my ground and provide consequences for bad behavior. It\u2019s very frustrating and I didn\u2019t want to be a b!tch but I honestly don\u2019t know how I would successfully watch kids that act out like that without being able to discipline", "They\u2019ve definitely gotten behavioral write ups and I guess in his eyes teachers are higher on the hierarchy. I\u2019m just their lowly aunt who should only strive to get them to like me\u2026", "I mean he\u2019s told me that as their aunt it\u2019s not my place to discipline and that I should\u2019ve just let them throw their tantrum then had him handle it when he got there. So idk what he expects from me. I don\u2019t want to be unwavering but I also don\u2019t want to be in some sort of situation where the kid hurts me or themselves and it\u2019s somehow still my fault for NOT doing something.", "That\u2019s truly how I feel. I would not be able to keep them safe so instead I just keep myself out of the situation.", "Well I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not just being a petty b!tch and my concerns are valid haha", "Yea I believe children need structure and the more immediate the response the more they\u2019ll understand what the consequences are a result of.", "My mom is a major pushover. She just kind of lets them do whatever and when they\u2019re bad she kind of makes it a joke and then just rides it out. I feel bad for her. I think she gets a little more leeway though with disciplining them than he allowed me. He literally said I\u2019m their aunt and I should be focused on making sure they like me.", "My mom is his mom so I guess he respects her more than me, his lowly little sister.", "I wanted to be transparent regarding where my hesitation started, but his behavior hasn\u2019t changed and I\u2019m also disabled now. Idk why he doesn\u2019t value my time or my boundaries. He\u2019s always been a \u201cdifficult\u201d person. He refuses to budge on what he thinks should be the case and no matter how much you offer opposing evidence, he will never change his stance.", "There, You have Your answer. NTA, but he is.", "And he wants someone he thinks is \"out of line\" to be in charge of his kids?  I would never want someone who was not in my line of thinking watching my kids!   If you ate so wrong for your actions then why would he want you watching them?\n\nFYI, I think you did the right thing.", "Thats a ridiculous attitude to have with a 5 year old throwing a tantrum. They need adult intervention and consequences. He just expects everyone who watches his kids to put up with crap behavior? Sounds like crap parenting to me.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want to pay for a sitter and thinks I should just do it for free and abide by his rules but I can\u2019t agree to that. I\u2019d feel so powerless to take charge of any situation that got out of control.", "He wanted me to just ride it out then let him handle it when he got there to pick him up. I took child development courses. Kids get very overwhelmed with their emotions and often need help processing them or at least containing them and educating to what is okay and what is not. They need structure. I just can\u2019t agree to watch them with no set boundaries.", "Yeah I volunteered in preschool for social and emotional needs and just figuring out strategies with my own kid. I doubt your brother does a lot in the parenting department because what you're doing is standard stuff. Don't feel bad for not watching the kids, he's unreasonable.", "I really tried so hard and I tried discussing it with him to no avail so yeah\u2026 not doing it."]}
