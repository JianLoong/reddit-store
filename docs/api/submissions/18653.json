She still lives in that small town and is still anxious when going out because her bullies were \"popular\" and knew everybody.\n\nHe knows the people in the area better than you do. Some small towns have insane dynamics. Maybe he's afraid that someone in the past will bully him, strart trouble for you or your parents, spot him and start gossiping, etc., If it's super serious to that point though then you both should probably just move to another town/city.\n\nIf you don't know what he went through, I wouldn't be so dismissive of his feelings.", "INFO: are you a male or female?
