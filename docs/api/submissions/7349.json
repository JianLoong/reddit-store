{"id": 7349, "submission_id": "10bxhge", "title": "AITA for letting my toddler disturb my neighbor's evenings?", "selftext": "My (24F) husband (26M) live in a 2 bedroom apartment with our toddler (2F) and newborn (4monthF) in a fair-sized apartment complex with lots of other families with young children. We've lived there for 2 years and enjoy it. Our girls are fairly quiet kids (at least compared to the others in our complex). \n\nRecently a single guy in his 30s-40s moved in to the apartment next door. My husband offered to help him move his stuff in, and as he was helping he mentioned we had two young kids. The guy immediately got pissy and said he specifically asked for an apartment away from all kids. We assured him ours are quiet and always asleep no later than 8:30, which didn't help. We looked his name up on the s3x offender registry in case that's why he was upset but it came up empty.\n\nMy toddler's only loud tendency is that she likes to sing, and it's usually as she's going to bed. Once we put her down for bed in her own room, she'll sing Wheels on the Bus or Ants Go Marching pretty loudly until she falls asleep, usually for like 10 minutes. Our neighbor's bedroom shares a wall with hers, unfortunately,  and within a day he stormed over and yelled at me to \"get control\" of my kid or he'd call the police. \n\nWe switched bedrooms with her, but apparently it wasn't enough because every night he pounds on our wall telling us to shut our kid up. He uses very aggressive, foul language and threatens to call the police (never does). It upsets our toddler and makes her cry, which enraged him even more and pisses me off.\n\nAt this point I've given up working with him. Here's where I might be TA: I've started singing along with her until she goes to sleep. And I match her volume or exceed it. My husband feels like it's petty and will drive him to be more aggressive, but I don't appreciate him screaming at us and our toddler over 10 minutes of singing early in the evening. \nSo Reddit, AITA here?\n\nETA: After having spent the day cooling off after last night's fight with this guy, I have decided my husband is right and I need to not antagonize the guy in case he turns out to be violent. We are aware that not everyone likes kids and do our best to make sure ours are well-mannered, but short of drugging her every night there's not much we can do to stop her. We've tried switching rooms so they don't share a wall, we've tried teaching her \"whisper singing\", we've offered to by him ear plugs for those ten minutes. Nothing works. I'm probably just going to record his yelling and give it to our landlord to handle.", "created_utc": 1673725662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bxhge/aita_for_letting_my_toddler_disturb_my_neighbors/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't know about private renters, but landlords under fair housing can NOT disclose whether a specific unit has children or not. Bring this up to your landlord immediately.", "NTA.

Firstly because it will likely antagonise him further, and secondly as it will reduce any argument/defence on his part that you're deliberately causing additional disturbance.

He\u2019s obviously a jerk and needs to cool it, but you need to work on de-escalating, not escalating. Speak to your landlord about his aggressive behavior and see if you can record his outbursts.

Why would you want to escalate this person's hostility towards you and your child? For your child's sake, I would swallow your sense of justice and encourage your child to sing more quietly, as it is bedtime and YOUR CHILD will hear less anger from him. \n\nYou are not stifling your child by teaching her a lower volume at sleepy time, and it's not good for her to hear this scary man verbally attacking her parents and her. It's more important to consider her actual needs over not wanting to appease the maniac next door.", "I stand by your pettiness fuck him. My last apartment complex I had a whole gaggle of kids (18mon to 16years) living across the hall from me and they were loud, and I mean yelling, crying, video games on full blast loud all day and then at night you'd usually find them running up and down the hall. Was it annoying to have to hear them constantly? Of course, I'm 26, and I work in a daycare, so the last thing I want to come home to is the sound of children. However, that's a reality of living in an apartment building, and especially in the area I was in, I would not want those kids running around outside or in the parking lot in the day time let alone when it was dark. Your neighbor needs to get a grip on his expectations, and I'd suggest next time he comes pounding on your door or your wall call the police and start a record of his behavior so you can have the apartment complex legally evict him.", " You need to report him to the apartment management.
