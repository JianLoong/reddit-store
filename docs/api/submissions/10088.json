The tradition is that the first child in the family to get engaged gets the ring for the proposal, and then they pass it down to their kids. \n\nSteven has a sister, \u201cAmanda.\u201d (31f). When we first met, she was in a very serious relationship. She brought up the ring to me and how she was told at a young age that someday it would be hers, she\u2019d be able to wear it once she got engaged, and she couldn\u2019t wait until she could pass it on to her kids. She mentioned it a few other times to me, and I could tell how important it was to her.\n\nShe and that boyfriend ended up breaking up. Now, she\u2019s been dating this guy \u201cBrian\u201d for almost a year. She told me a couple months ago that she thinks that Brian is the one.\n\nSteven and I have talked about our future a lot, and a month ago, when discussing marriage, I suggested that instead of me receiving the ring, maybe it should be saved for Amanda. I am not particularly tied to it the way she is, and it\u2019s clear it\u2019s important to her. It also sounds like it was promised to her. Steven didn\u2019t have any objections, and he told me he wholeheartedly agreed\u2014he didn\u2019t want to upset Amanda, and he also didn\u2019t feel that tied to the tradition. He said that he\u2019d tell his mom that he didn\u2019t want it, and that she should save it for Amanda instead, and so I assumed it was settled.\n\nYesterday, he proposed to me. We called our family to let them know, and Steven\u2019s mom was overjoyed. We thought everything was great until I posted pictures to share on social media. About a half hour later, we get an angry phone call from his mother, yelling about the ring and breaking the family tradition and ruining it, and that she was blindsided. I guess he didn\u2019t tell her beforehand.\n\nSteven told her that it was all my idea, he had his reservations about it because of the tradition but ultimately agreed because he didn\u2019t want to fight, he didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her because he knew it\u2019d hurt her, but he wanted me happy, etc. I was shocked\u2014I felt like he threw me under the bus. Sure, I brought it up, but we both agreed upon it and we didn\u2019t have an argument, and if he had reservations, I surely didn\u2019t know about them. I heard his mother say some really nasty things about me and suggested that he should question our relationship.\n\nAfter he hung up with her, we got into an argument about it. He said that it was my fault because I was the one who suggested it and considered his sister\u2019s feelings over him, and now the whole family is pissed at him. He said if I cared about him, then I wouldn\u2019t have even brought this up months ago.\n\nI\u2019m really confused and upset, and now my fianc\u00e9 is mad at me, and he\u2019s even confronted his sister about the whole thing to blame her for putting thoughts in my head to manipulate me.

Neither option is a great omen for a marriage. \n\nWhichever way Steven is lying, he's apparently unable to have difficult conversations with people he cares about. How are you supposed to survive a few decades of marriage if you can't trust that your husband will be honest throughout whatever financial issues, health issues, and big decisions will come up? How can you survive a few decades of being attached to his family if he will always take his mother's side over yours?", "NTA\n\n> I suggested that instead of me receiving the ring, maybe it should be saved for Amanda.

Communicating clearly with you when you brought it up that it would actually be an issue for him? Not a priority. No, based on your fiance's actions, his highest priority was accommodating his mother and avoiding responsibility - to the degree which he is blaming his mother, his sister, and you.\n\nCheck his mother's actions. Her daughter's feelings? Not a priority. Maintaining a tradition was her priority. Her behaviour was poor, but your fiance was worse - he brought her wrath down upon you by not communicating with his mother once you'd done your due diligence.\n\nYou deserve better. It was good of you to try and accommodate Amanda; I hope you can keep a healthy relationship with her. You may want to reconsider your relationship with your fiance.", "Wowwww dude. Wow. Your fianc\u00e9 lied to your face!!! He was more worried about mommy\u2019s feelings than yours. You did a very sane, kind thing, and your fianc\u00e9 is absolutely nuts. Give the ring back and bounce. NTA.", "NTA You had a conversation with your fiancee, explained your thoughts, asked for his, he agreed. If he lied to you, he lied to you, and that's on him, not you.

Lots of questions need answering before moving forwards.", "NTA - You and your fianc\u00e9e agreed to let the ring go to Amanda, as it's far more important and special to her than it is to you. If you'd adhered to the tradition, Amanda would probably be heartbroken, and you'd have a ring you're not very attached to.\n\nBut the real problem is the fact that when Steven didn't explain this to his mother ahead of time, and then LIED (either to you about not caring about the tradition, or to his mother about being apprehensive) as soon as he faced backlash, throwing you under the bus for something you both agreed on.\n\nThen he even got angry at you and his sister for something he'd had months to consider, accusing his sister of manipulating you even though she'd spoken about the ring when you'd first met, likely when an engagement seemed far closer for her than for you and Steven.\n\nThe way he's acting is childish, OP, and he's not the one who should be reconsidering the relationship, YOU should be after the way he's acted.\n\nIf the tradition is so important to his family that they're all so angry at him, he should have brought this up with you far earlier.", "The big question is do you want to be a part of a family who puts more value on a hunk of metal than the actual people they supposedly love?\n\nSteven needs to apologize to his mother for giving her the wrong idea.

You don't need to want this ring. But that's not even the case here, you just wanted to let her daughter have it, since it's really important to her. She still thinks you're an AH to the point of wanting to end your engagement over a stupid ring and that's just insane.\n\nBut the real problem is your fiance. He's playing the victim now that he realized how mad his mom is and instead of owning the decision you both made he's blaming it all on you. That's literally the first time that I'm saying this on Reddit and I don't say this lightly, but if I were you I would reconsider just how much I can trust this guy. He's lying and showing he won't protect you, even worse, he's willing to sacrifice you to save himself. Idk girl, that's not a good sign.", "NTA - you were thinking about his sister and respecting his family. The oldest gets the ring, not the first, right?", "NTA you sure you want to marry a guy like him though? Marriage is expensive. Divorce more so.", "NTA. The relationship should be questioned, but not by him. This guy has thrown you under a bus and is 1) either lying to his mum to save face, or 2) lying about his feelings to you.

Keep her as part of the divorce settlement too. Fob the rest of them off. NTA.", "I think it was very sweet of you to consider Amanda's feelings about the ring.

Mother is...  Your fiance needs to be a man and tell his mother this is his life and relationship. I don't consider myself to be an overly assertive person, but there is zero chance my mother or mother-in-law would have dared trying that with my wife and I. I don't mean to shake the foundation, but I've seen issues like this before. You don't want to make him choose between his mother and you, but in my opinion he really should only be concerned with your feelings. When I proposed, all I could think about was how could I make this special for her, and how happy I was that she picked me. No family drama or expectations mattered, just her.\n\nI sincerely hope this works out for you.", "Are you sure this is the person you want to spend your life with?

I would take a step back from this situation and your engagement and really look at the way he\u2019s acting right now and consider if he\u2019s ever acted like this in the past.

What kind of roll-over, pee-on-yourself guttless shit was that? And when he finally did decide to take a stand in the matter, he took a stand against you. You're the one that initiated the conversation to avoid any potential calamities. You made the proper attempts to appease your (hopefully ex) future in-laws. \n\nA few different ways I'm looking at this... To me, he either had his reservations about the ring and lied to you about them (which I can't for the life of me understand the need for that, unless you're an insufferable bitch, which I highly doubt considering how  thoughtful and considerate you were being toward his sister's wishes about the ring)...  so lying for no real reason is fucking concerning! \nAnother potential is that he didn't think that it would be this big of a deal but once it blew up he made up a bunch of bullshit and used you as a scapegoat, so yeah, freakishly concerning behavior. \n Perhaps he honestly didn't care either way but he knew it wouldn't go over well with his family and just wanted to see the outcome of the situation so he could powertrip over you? \n\nIm failing to see this from any other perspective than a fast and furious JFC, GTFO! Because that behavior is crazy-making. Like, his behavior is that of a person that would intentionally make you question your own reality/experiences because taking any accountability for his own behavior or contributions to a situation would cause him to go into anaphylaxis.  \n\nFinal notes? It seems you would have been destined to be at odds with either his mother or with his sister inevitability, but I can see his mom siding with the sister if she were to be angry with you (regardless of it being for a tradition that the mom enforces).

I know we shouldn't throw the divorce/dump card easily, but in this case it will literally solve the problem :'D", "Oof, I mixed things up. \ud83d\ude2b Well... it still would have much more meaning to Amanda than to OP.", "NTA\nIs this guy right for you?\n\n He lied about telling his mum.\nHe didn't defend you, he passed all the blame onto you.", "NTA but why the hell would you allow yourself to be gaslit and manipulated like this. He would rather I to you and throw you under the bud than deal with the drama of his family. All of them sound completely unstable and you need to question if this is the right relationship for you. Don\u2019t settle for mediocrity.", "So he told you he shared your feelings, lied about talking with his mom, let his mom become livid, and then told both of you that he never agreed with you in the first place?\n\nYour man... cannot handle conflict. And, worse, he thinks that he can make \"everyone happy\" by just totally checking out of tense situations.\n\nThis is a problem for you. It means that you will never truly know what he thinks and \u2014 WORSE \u2014 what he is actually doing about matters of disagreement between you.\n\nAnd they're there in every marriage. They get harder if/when kids arrive.\n\nI don't think he's grown up enough for this. Think long and hard about whether you see yourself married to someone avoidant and underhanded.\n\nNTA", "NTA but take his mothers warning to heart and reconsider this relationship if he was willing to lie and throw you under the bus about the ring the bar has been set is this the way you want the rest of your life to go", "You sure you wanna marry this man OP? The first sign of trouble he threw you in the lions dens. Kinda like that guy from the movie who left his wife and children when zombies are chasing them\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "NTA - stop! Back up the bus. Return the ring and run like hell!", "NTA.\n\nYou sure this is the future you want?\n\nWhat you did is a wonderful gesture to FSIL and it's wierd his mother isn't happy with it going to her own daughter", "NTA. But you will be if you marry this idiot.", "NTA.  But you really need to take a look at this relationship.  I would run as fast as I could.\nThis gives you a peek into what life as his wife will be like. \nDo you want to marry a man that doesn\u2019t protect you?  Someone who is clearly a liar?\nUnderstand this is not a one off and displays his true character.\nBest wishes and good luck. \ud83c\udf39", "NTA but you will be (to yourself) if you don\u2019t run away from this relationship. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. It sounds like if you marry this man, you're also going to be marrying his mother. Is that what you want for the rest of your life?", "The obvious solution here is to dump the spineless boyfriend and marry Amanda", "NTA, but RUN!  RUN FAST!  There are red flags all over here.  Your soon to be husband sound like he has manipulative tendencies.  And i'm sure that's only the tip of the iceberg.", "Putting like that...anyone else getting a \"golden child/eldest son is special\" vibe from Stephen's family?", "Yes, that is right."]}
