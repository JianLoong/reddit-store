I (26f) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for 5 years now. We met in college. Our relationship has been really good and healthy so far until something happened last weekend.\n\nMy boyfriend has a big group of friends (all male) that he brings over to our apartment every weekend, they usually watch football or Game of Thrones or just hang out. I don't know these guys super well, I wouldn't call them my friends but obviously I know their names and jobs and girlfriends, etc, we're like accquantinces. \n\nThere's this one friend he has that I'll call Jake that I've always felt kind of uncomfortable around. He would always stare at me whenever he came into the kitchen and it always weirded me out. I brought it up with my boyfriend a few times. Jake is high functioning autistic, and my boyfriend would always bring that up and say he's just socially awkward and he's not trying to be a creep. So I left it alone.\n\nFast forward to this weekend, I was in the kitchen, and I hear them talk about NNN. I wasn't trying to listen in but we do live in a small apartment and the kitchen and living room are side by side. I heard my boyfriend saying he lost because of me, which I thought was kind of innapropriate but whatever. Then I hear Jake saying \"me too\" and all of them laughed. \n\nAfter they had all left, I told my boyfriend what I overheard and he kind of laughed it off. I pressed it though because I wasn't sure if I had misheard Jake saying he lost NNN because of me. Then my boyfriend said that was what Jake had said. I was stunned and extremely uncomfortable which I feel like is reasonable. I told my boyfriend it was really disgusting that he would let Jake say that about me, in our own house, while I was literally next to them, and I also brought up the fact that I've talked to him before about feeling uncomfortable with Jake.\n\nMy boyfriend got really defensive and said he knew Jake had a \"little crush\" on me but it wasn't a big deal. I was really upset that despite knowing that, he let Jake come into our house. Like what could have happened if no one else was around and we were alone? My boyfriend said i was being \"paranoid\" and Jake would never touch me or hurt me, but the fact that he masturbated to me (and I don't even know if it was to my Instagram pictures or some photo he's  taken of me that I don't know about or god forbid, something my boyfriend has sent him) still makes me extremely uncomfortable, and I told my bf that.\n\nFinally he said he would talk to Jake about it, but he kept bringing up the fact that he's autistic so he doesn't understand social cues and it was going to be difficult to explain why it was innapropriate to him. I'm just stunned because I don't understand how my boyfriend didn't stand up for me or say anything, and continued to allow Jake into our home despite knowing he's sexually interested in me.", "created_utc": 1700362530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ynbde/aita_for_fighting_with_my_boyfriend_because_he/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This situation is obviously different as he is creepy and staring at you. But a well adjusted male should be able to be brought around even if he finds you attractive. Are you sure it wasnt just a joke on the NNN thing", "For those of us that do not use abbreviations/initials, what is NNN?", "NTA. Autism has absolutely NOTHING to do with this. He is being a creep. Even if it was \u201cjust because he doesn\u2019t understand social cues\u201d, your boyfriend should be telling him that he is being creepy & making you uncomfortable, not just using his autism as an excuse.", "NTA autistic with ADHD here. Whatever his status, that was gross. Your BF knew it was inappropriate and went along. He validated his friends creepy behavior and he has access to your home. He needs to acknowledge it was wrong and set boundaries.", "NTA , Jake should really know his boundaries because autism isn't an excuse for creepy behaviours, if your boyfriend isn't going to talk to him through this then you should talk to Jake to now more clearly about his intentions and what's going on, it's fine that he finds you attractive but he clearly knows you have a partner and he shouldn't act that way", "NTA but you are massively overreacting. This guy isn\u2019t a threat, and his comment isn\u2019t some massive disrespect. You heard guys talking like guys. If your man doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s a threat, you should trust that.", "Uhhhhh\n\nWow, this just doesn't seem like a big deal to me, like, not one bit. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI'll say NAH here, I suppose, only because if you feel uncomfortable then I don't feel it's my place to tell you you don't have that right. But this really feels like you're making a big deal out of literally nothing to me.", "Definitely not the asshole, it\u2019s the way you feel so your boyfriend should listen and not make you feel like you\u2019re overreacting. If this other guy has autism then it\u2019ll mostly likely do more harm if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t bring it up with him and he does something similar around someone who could get violent etc. \nAs a guy I\u2019ve always found the whole NNN and the talk around it so weird and pointless anyway, it\u2019s just strange imo.", "NTA - Ah, autism. Or should I say \"autism *wink*\". It is the new get out of jail free card for people who are wildly inappropriate and make others feel unsafe. This guy's behaviour is creepy as and a label doesn't excuse it. Be aware, people like this cause major trouble in relationships.", "[deleted]", "NTA, autism or not, a creep is a creep. I wouldn't want him in my home again. Your bf needs to find a new venue for his weekend friend stuff or next time he stares at you, call him out. \"Jake, why you always staring at me? It's weird.\" And then just dead ass stare at him and wait for an answer.", "NTA- but as long as the weird dude doesnt give off vibes that he would go and do anything to you i dont think its that big of a deal. Him saying that he lost NNN because of you could be an wgo boost to your bf bc he kniws your hot and his friends know it too. 99% of the time guys like that lose to a persons instagram so hes probably not taking creepy pictures. Noone is really in the wrong here its just different points of view for the same subject. If you really dont like him and think he is a real threat to your saftey talk about it if hes just kinda uncomfy to you maybe just let the guy be weird idk", "NAH - Jake made a joke. Yes it was inappropriate, but you were not the intended audience. Boys often make inappropriate jokes with one another, hence why they all laughed. That being said, your feelings are valid and you have every right to feel uncomfortable having heard it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not now.", "Because *if* he genuinely is unaware that his behaviour is unacceptable (which I doubt he is, to be clear) his behaviour will most likely continue to escalate", "Yeah if he stares at her and creeps her out and has a mental issue yes that means he probably has less control and less of an understanding of boundaries, its not really a question", "Another redditor told me what it meant.
