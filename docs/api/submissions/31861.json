You have tried to politely bring it to his attention, there isn\u2019t much more you can do. \n\nDistance yourself. It would be impolite to get one of those plague masks that you put the sweet smelling herbs in so you don\u2019t smell the rot. Yes, that would be impolite. So distance yourself. And nobody could say anything if you pulled a little paper mask out of your pocket. A paper mask can\u2019t hurt, and it might help a little?

You smell really bad all the time and no-one wants to hang around you any more because of it.  You're great, and we don't want to lose you as a friend, but you're being incredibly inconsiderate by not washing and we're just going to stop spending time with you if you don't sort it out because it's a *really bad* smell and we can't stand it.\"", "NTA. Thats something that will negatively impact his life. If i smelled bad I\u2019d want my friends to tell me so i can fix it. True friends arent afraid to have an awkward conversation to save you from future embarrassment", "Do you have a form tutor or homeroom teacher or someone? Someone must be in charge of this guy and you guys' pastoral welfare, right? I'd escalate this to staff, to be honest - evidently he isn't listening to you!", "NTA. Your friend either has a medical problem or he lacks appropriate hygiene practices either due to laziness or poor mental health: I don\u2019t know which and neither do you. You are not an AH for letting him know there is a problem. Or trying to.  His lack of response of any kind is concerning. The real AHs here are his parents and the school officials who do nothing when a teen exhibits what may be Old Person Smell which has to do with excessive oxidation of lipid oils. Or severe depression.", "NTA, sometimes people have these conditions and are unaware.  Unless it is obviously due to poor hygiene, assuming so is a little bit rude, but it\u2019s better than being passive aggressive about it.  It\u2019s a tough situation for everyone involved because some people are triggered by this.  What I think most people don\u2019t realize is that person probably is impervious to what they are emitting and it may or may not be their fault.", "NTA, but I will say that I was a foster child, and before that was severely neglected/abused.  No one ever taught me how to clean myself properly, and I didn't know there was a proper way until I was on my own.  I probably reeked something fierce in school.  Is this a possibility with your friend?", "~~YTA~~\n\nesh\n\nTell him to visit a doctor, don't body shame him/", "You\u2019re the asshole. He could be poor or maybe even smell sexual and you\u2019ve been making JOKES??? If I were you I\u2019d just buy nose plugs or distance yourself from his lovely scents (beauty is in the eye of the beholder) and stop making him feel bad.

Has anyone told him clearly before? \n\nIt's always a delicate issue to tell someone they are smelling bad on a daily basis and I'd only do that if the person was really a friend, not just a colleague. \n\nThe friend might not receive the message in a good way, keep in mind this risk always exist. But if you think it's really unbereable and might affect his life and personal relationships, the best way imo is to be direct like \"Man, I really don't mean it in a bad way, I'm saying this because I'm your friend and I'm concerned to what's happening but it's been a while now that you have a really bad smell, have you noticed? Maybe if you are bathing regularly and using deodorant it's a medical issue?\" Something like that. Good luck cuz yea this situation really sucks for both parties", "Sounds like you are looking for /r/advice and not AITA. Anyway, you say it's not BO, and that he is aware of it and unhappy with it himself, so it likely isn't a hygiene issue. Plus, if he's not noticeably dirty, he must be cleaning himself sometimes, so would at least occasionally smell fine if that's all it was. He needs to consult a medical professional about this.", "Ah, the rotten milk smell. My dad smells like that. He's homeless and only showers occasionally when he's staying with me.\n\nSounds like your friend isn't washing himself. He also knows he stinks because you (and probably others) have mentioned it. Either he doesn't care, or he's depressed.\n\nNTA, but you'd be beating a dead horse. More of the same isn't going to help. Maybe try talking to him about how he's doing, whether he needs someone to talk to.", "Refuse to hang out with them until they wash", "he has access to all of it, he has a pretty lavish home life. The worst part about this situation is that every time me or someone else confronts him about it he acts insecure and like he will do something about it but never does.", "thanks for the advice. its pretty obvious that he\u2019s aware of it but chooses to do nothing about it, so i guess there really is nothing i or anyone else can do about it", "im beginning to think r/advice may have been the better place for this post but i\u2019ll take what i can get. thank you for this", "this is exactly my reasoning, thank you", "i dont even know how i would bring it up to a superior though", "i should clarify, he doesn\u2019t smell like an old person. he smells like some kind of garbage mixed with like a rotten yeasty smell. no idea what it is but this could point me in the right direction", "no, his family is among the richest in the school and he is well educated on how to maintain good hygiene. i know this because there have been days when he does not smell at all, though very rare, and its because he took the time to shower and put on clean clothes.", "we have. we aren\u2019t body shaming him, we\u2019re telling him of a genuine issue he needs to solve, and he isnt solving it.", "hes heard the same thing from people he doesnt know as well as friends like me. its really unfortunate", "it was more in the r/advice niche but aita was the first sub that came to mind because i honestly thought it was my fault.", "Nothing you can really do I suppose. I would just be honest. \n\n\u201cMan I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s awkward but you really small bad and it\u2019s really hard to be around you for a long period of time. We love you to death but you have got to figure something out. If there is anything we can do please ask us.\u201d", "My husband said you should talk to your teacher. Make sure he has mental health or a functioning bathroom at home?", "np, just be honest, explain that you still want to be friends, but you can't unless he sorts this problem out.  Ask him if there's anything he needs help with, but make sure that he knows that you won't be hanging out any more if he doesn't sort himself out.  Best of luck :)", "I was the stinky guy once. People started leaving me notes, bars of Irish spring on the driver's seat of my car etc. Mostly these were people from work. I worked construction in a trade known to get filthy dirty from day to day. So it was easy to blow some of this off as workplace humor. I showered every day, used deodorant religiously. I even had extra deodorant in the car for use at lunch or whatever. Same with keeping an extra shirt, pants in the car. I was finally taken aside by the forman and told that some on the crew refused to work with me due to my smell.  \n  \n    Of course the crew asked me what the forman wanted and I told them the issue. We all looked at each other, up to our knees in debrie, and laughed. Of course we stunk. It must have been some primadonna with a pristine nose complaining.... So easy to think there's really no issue here. \n\n   I got partnered up with the alcoholic on the crew the next week. Now HE stunk. It was all the alcohol sweating out of his system. A sickly sweet yet rancid smell. He was so used to it he couldn't tell he stunk, and the lightbulb went off. I was divorced, my social circle revolved around bars and tavern activity's at the time and being around beer I tended to drink it often. Especially on weekends. I adjusted my drinking habits, changed my social circle, and all those notes and extra bars of soap quit appearing. \n\n    The point is, he's probably doing extra showers. Dousing himself in deodorant. Making sure his clothes are clean etc. So those complaining just must have princess noses. He needs to pinpoint what the cause is because it could a sneaky thing.  Blowing it off will just continue causing problems.", "It might be a bit awkward, but evidently it's affecting you guys' wellbeing and academic attainment if someone had to leave a test because of it, no? It's better to have a tricky conversation with staff now than having the rest of your academic year ruined by one person.", "This is probably a medical condition. You may want to Google info before shaming him again. I don't recall the name of the condition but there are remedies.", "Ah.  Well, I would ask about mental health as well, but that doesn't seem to be an issue either.  It seems more like a lot of teen boys I've fostered myself, where it is simply a low priority for them.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would suggest talking to him once more, explaining that his odor is physically pushing people away, but that you also aren't his carer, and he needs to get it together or he will lose people he cares about.  ono", "ESH\n\nyour solutions are body shaming\n\nYou are saying \"you aren't clean\"  when the issue is \"most people don't like your odor\"", "Fair enough. I forgot to say this, but I seriously doubt you could have had anything to do with making it worse.\n\nHow close are you with this person? Can you get into questions of what he has been trying, and how you can be supportive?", "he\u2019s got both in good shape. i dont even know how talking to a teacher would even play out but i could give it a shot.", "but the issue is caused by him being unclean. is it that hard to make the connection?", "very close. the only effort he\u2019s made is buying deodorant, which did nothing noticeable. don\u2019t really know yet how i can even help him either", "Its most likely hormonal or some other medical condition.  \n\nNo one goes this long being smelly by choice", "even if it is (which it probably is yeah) it\u2019s still within his purview to do something about it. it doesnt feel like something i should have to tell him to do", "No you shouldn't.\n\nBut you are choosing to", "because he isnt doing it himself? whats the issue here, i\u2019m a friend trying to help my friend avoid something that could really mess him up", "Help him avoid it by recommending doctors. Not by recommending he use chemicals to poorly cover up the odor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are choosing to tell him his hygiene standards are wrong.   With zero proof.  You are ASSuming the cause of the odor.  That is what makes you the AH", "no, i KNOW he has bad hygiene and i KNOW that its one of the reasons he doesn\u2019t smell good. sure, there COULD be medical reasons, but there is definitely a hygiene coefficient there."]}
