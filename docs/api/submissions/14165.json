My sister (14F) isn't a fan of it, and makes that clear a lot. I'm sick of her whining when she has a roof over her head.\n\nThe other day I needed to ask her where something was, so I went to her room. When I went to open the door it was locked. She opened the door and asked me what was up, and I was pretty shocked. You see our parents still knock, so I guess they never noticed she's been locking the door, since it's one of those push in locks that pops out when you open it from the inside.\n\nI asked her how long she's been doing that, and she said for a year, and also told me not to tell them. I said I will unless she promises to stop, they deserve to have their house rules respected. She called me a dick and walked away.

Don\u2019t dob on your sister if the only reason you know she\u2019s breaking a harmless rule is because you\u2019re an arsehole.", "Snitching on your neighbors...because rules and laws.\n\nHappened during Stalin's r\u00e9gime, and Hitler's, fun times right?\n\nIf rules only serve as a means of control, then they aren't good rules.", "Listen dude, as a girl with 3 brothers, one younger and 2 older, your sibling bond is more important than snitching to your parents. Siblings need to have each other's backs, always.\n\nIs your sister in danger? No? Then what's to tell?\n\nKnock on your sisters door and wait for her to let you in in future. Afford her the same privacy and respect you would like to recieve.\n\nRemember, one day your parents will be dead, and it will just be you and your sister. Choose how your relationship should be wisely.", "No. \n\nI'm a parent. I do expect rules to be followed. \nBut i also expect pajamas to rules (especially stupid ones) \nAnd kids' relationship to a sibling is far far far FAR more important than a really stupid rule. \n\nFocus on respecting your sister and her autonomy at least add much as you focus on parents and their respect crap.\n\nDon't tell.", "Absolutely not. I would much rather my kids look out for each other. Make parenting interesting, work together.", "As a parent? Unless one of the kids was a danger to themselves or others? No.", "Has it ever occurred to you that your parents do know that she locks her door & just let her keep doing it because you barge into her room like you own the place? Is her locking her door hurting you in any way? No? Keep your mouth shut. There\u2019s going to come a time when you\u2019re going to need her to cover your behind & guess what her answer will be if you snitch?", "I'd rather my children respect each other and KNOCK instead of my 16 year old son walking in and invading the privacy of my 14 year old daughter.  Because that's what you did. A closed door is not an invitation to walk in. It's a request for privacy. You walking in would justify her need to lock the door. So....if you were my kid, I'd be disappointed in you and you'd be listening to a great speech about privacy, trust, and your apparent need to be the authority figure over your sister. You'd be in more shit than her. Knock it off.\n\nYTA\nYWBTA", "If she\u2019s not doing anything that endangers herself or others, keep your mouth shut.", "you must be fun at parties. probably not invited tho", "I\u2019m sure they\u2019d rather know their children aren\u2019t tattle tales", "It depends on the rule. No drinking alcohol? Yes, because that's a potential danger. But if one of my kids had an issue with a rule, I'd expect the other kid to stay out of it and the kid with the issue to discuss it with me. And if I'm such a hard-ass that the kid with the issue is afraid to talk to me, I'd still want the other kid not to be a little snitch. \n\nWhy not encourage your sister to discuss the no-locked-door rule with your parents instead of you narcing on her? There may be a compromise that'd work. If your parents are afraid they couldn't get to you in a fire, maybe doors stay unlocked after bedtime. \n\nP.S. Since all kids break rules once in a while, keep in mind that if you snitch on your sister, she's going to watch you like a hawk and snitch on you.", "Another parent here.\n\nMy goal is to have my children be a team. They don\u2019t have to like each other, let alone love each other, but I do want them to see each other as part of the same team/unit. \n\nPart of that is making clear that my love is unconditional and equal.\n\nI would much rather my kids turn to each other than turn against each other to try and win my favor.", "I\u2019d rather find out myself than find out that my kid was a snitch. YTA.", "Snitch", "YTA for being a boring troll.", "Nope. I'd rather my siblings have a living bonds and can trust each other. Someday we'll be gone and I hope they have each other to lean on through the hard parts of life. \n\nMy parents pitted us against each other and had stupid rules that violated our privacy. I have no contact with my father, his wife or any of my siblings.", "As a mom of two, no I wouldn't.", "As long as no one is bleeding, doing drugs or hurt, then siblings back eachother up. Mine are younger and I have already started to tell them that they can argue but they support and help eachother when they can. They don\u2019t add on trouble that they may find with me. Stand up for eachother. You may be too old for time outs, but mine get time off their iPad for purposely snitching in eachother.", "You want her punished so bad it\u2019s weird. She\u2019s not going to have a relationship with you at all if you think you\u2019re doing the right thing. Her locking her door was never an issue until you felt the need to barge in on her. You\u2019re the problem. How you treat her flows into how you\u2019ll treat other women and that\u2019s not good.", "NOT BY YOU. You have ZERO authority over your sister. If you want to be ostracized by being a nosy, intrusive, tattletale, just keep on with this. Everyone will hate you sooner or later.", "No in fact I had this discussion with my father when I was about your age and my younger brother kept trying to get me in trouble for rule violations. My father who was very religious and in many ways overprotective said he would rather not know about the small infractions because he wanted us to always have someone to call if we were in trouble that we knew would have our back. He hoped we never needed it but the reality was sometimes people make mistakes and get in over their head. If one of us made a bad choice to drink at a party he wanted us to always feel safe calling a sibling for a ride rather then trusting a stranger or drunk friend.", "I'd prefer them to actually have a good relationship instead of one believing the other is untrustworthy for being a snitch.", "No. I tell my kids that they shouldn\u2019t tattle unless there\u2019s danger involved that I need to know about. I don\u2019t want my kids jeopardizing their relationship or trying to one up each other to get on our good side. It\u2019s not an admirable quality which is why you should keep your mouth shut.", "Protect your sister. Yta.", "I'd rather my children minded their own business than micromanage other people because they apparently have nothing better to do than snoop around and tattle tale. Get a hobby.", "As a parent of 5 kids I wouldn't want you to unless the other child was literally hurting themselves or other (or planning it). Otherwise nope, if it's egregious enough I'll figure it out soon enough & if it's small enough it's good bonding for y'all.", "It\u2019s really disturbing that you feel you need to police your sister\u2019s behavior when what she\u2019s doing has ZERO affect on you. She\u2019s been doing it for a year. Clearly this hasn\u2019t hurt anyone, your parents included. \n\nI\u2019m a parent to two kids, would I want one child to tattletale on the other for locking their door, even if it was one of my house rules? No, I wouldn\u2019t. Not even a little bit.", "YTA.  No one likes a narc.", "No, I want kids who aren't whiney, tattling bootlickers.", "Strong disagree. Locks are pretty standard on bedroom doors. Especially when siblings who like to creep up on their siblings all gross like or theivey like the OP exist. The reason we had locks on the door as kids... Privacy and also my sibling who couldn't stop stealing crap from everyone and walking in on people.", "You don't get to decide what is an issue for her, your entitlement to her is alarming. I wouldn't be surprised if you pushed your sister away with the way you're acting. Gross", "Why would she take her clothes to the bathroom to change when they're already in her room where she can just as easily change.", "You take your clothes to the bathroom to get dressed?", "Doesn't matter, she should have the assurance that she can change clothes in her room without her brother barging in on her without knocking.", "You are 16 and have no reason to be entering your 14 year old sisters room without knocking first", "You\u2019re so the AH . Why are you so intent on snitching on your sibling ? What do you hope to achieve in doing so other than sucking up to your parents and potentially ruining your relationship with your sister. Keep up this attitude and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she goes no contact with you .", "You don\u2019t get to decide how she uses her room! Usually doesn\u2019t mean every time. \n\nDo you go through the bathroom trash too so you know when she is on her period?", "\"usually,\" so what you're saying is you want to see your 16 year old sister changing.", "This is incredibly fucking weird behavior. Just an FYI.", "You usually do that in the bathroom but you don't know if she's changing or not. Some people like to try on different outfits to see what works. \n\nYou tried to barge into your teenage sisters room, that's the issue here. When you couldn't just barge in now you're gonna go whine to mommy and daddy so you can again, that's all that you can change in this situation and honestly you should reflect on why it's so important to you that you can barge into her room.", "\u201cSo being a pervert isn\u2019t really an issue\u201d honestly maybe you should so your parents can see you need therapy", "And now they have internet grifters", "All I remember was suddenly hearing my daughter scream what the fuck and my son slamming the door running to his room. He has never barged into a room without knocking again.", "I mean you dont have to have that rule with your kids but its just not the crime of the century, if you are properly knocking and waiting for permission to come in there shouldn't be anything wrong with this.", "As a mother of 2 boys, I couldn\u2019t agree more. I hope they have each others backs, especially on small things like this.", "I like you. You sound like a good parent", "I wholeheartedly agree and can't stress just how important it is to let kids form that camaraderie when possible. \n\nI once commented on a post by a boy who was frustrated with his sister and had lashed out. I explained that she likely looked up to him, given the context. I, and a few others, told him of important times our sibling had our backs, and how great it felt to be able to count on each other. He thought that sounded pretty amazing, and wanted to have that kind of relationship. \n\nHe posted an update, and it made me so happy for him. He handled it in such a mature way. He took responsibility for lashing out, and really talked with his sister. He made a few little changes, and said it immediately made a huge difference. \n\nSorry to randomly ramble, this just reminded me of that kid and how happy he sounded.", "I'm sorry but I have to disagree. I've been friends with my childhood best friend for 19 years now, he was the sister I never had, now he's the brother I never had. We've been together trough learning to understand our gender identities (him), sexual orientation, sickness and disability (me), mental health struggles, bullying and being adults. My biological brother is the reason I've spent half my twenties and will most likely spend all my thirties in treatment for CPTSD. Biological siblings aren't magical. They can have an amazing bond (like my best friend and his sister) but just being biologically related and raised together doesn't have to mean anything", "That last sentence should be a slogan either to get people to be better parents together (either as a couple or co-parents) or to get parents to work with their children to turn them into successful adults (and by successful I don't mean \"college degree, 6 figure income\" but \"can take care of themselves as far as their physical and mental health allows, know how to do chores, take responsibility and have healthy relationships to other people\")", "Because she has a creepy brother who wants to control what his sister does.", "I live alone and I do that?

I\u2019m afraid of walking in on something that makes me traumatized lol.", "But the OP isn't knocking and waiting for permission, he said he \"went to open the door\" and was surprised to find it locked. He didn't respect the family rule of knock and wait for confirmation, he just attempted to enter without prior notice or consent.\n\nThough you could argue that both siblings are breaking the family rules, one set of rule breaking feels intrusive while the other feels defensive/protecting oneself.", "Not if other people in the house arent. And id still be quite nervous to change or god forbid masturbate with an unlocked door lol", "I'd rather my children bond over how ridiculous we are than rat each other out.", "Thanks believe me, I made my fair share of mistakes but I have nice children who cut me some slack.", "My brother is an asshole, a leech, and a waste of skin.
