{"id": 15557, "submission_id": "12x4o6z", "title": "AITA for making my sister wear high heels for my mother\u2019s funeral?", "selftext": "My younger sister (31 F) has lived with me (37F) in the basement of my house ever since her house was foreclosed on in 2020. I\u2019ve felt pity for her because her life has been a disaster recently (toxic divorce, house, etc.) \n\nA couple weeks ago, my mother (70F) unexpectedly passed from an aneurism. I\u2019ve been absolutely devastated these past few weeks and so is my sister, obviously.\n\nThe funeral happened a few days ago, on Friday to be precise. Me, my husband, and the kids are all dressed and ready to go. I go downstairs to get my sister and she\u2019s dressed in a black skirt with stockings and a black suit jacket. All good right? \n\nWrong.\n\nShe has tennis shoes on over her black dress stockings. \n\nFUCKING NEON TENNIS SHOES.\n\nHere\u2019s our conversation:\n\n*Hey don\u2019t you have a pair of dressier shoes?*\n\nNo I only have tennis shoes. Sorry.\n\n*Ok well you\u2019re not wearing those. I have a pair of shoes you can borrow.*\n\nShe follows me upstairs and I go into my closet. Now, for dress shoes, I only have high heels. I don\u2019t like flats and have never worn flats in my entire adult life. The only black pair of dress shoes I have, besides the ones I\u2019m wearing for the funeral, are patent leather, stiletto-heeled Louboutin So Kate\u2019s. \n\nI grab them and hand them to my sister. She looks surprised. \n\n*Here make sure these fit.*\n\nThose are too high for me.\n\n*Just please wear them, sis.*\n\nCan\u2019t we just stop on the way so I can buy something lower?\n\n*No we are running late. You\u2019re seriously telling me you don\u2019t have a single pair of shoes that you can wear to a funeral?*\n\nI only really wear tennis shoes. I don\u2019t think I can walk in these.\n\n*Well you can\u2019t wear tennis shoes to  our mom\u2019s funeral!*\n\nThey\u2019ll murder my feet!\n\n*It\u2019s only one day! We\u2019ll be sitting for most of it!*\n\nDon\u2019t you have anything lower for me?\n\n*No sorry I only have the one pair that\u2019s black.*\n\nOh my good they look so uncomfortable!\n\n*If you don\u2019t wear the heels you\u2019re not coming.*\n\nFinally, she tries them on. They are too tight but I don\u2019t really care. Her feet fit in the shoes and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\n\nThe funeral was emotional. I broke down multiple times. Between the service and reception it lasted around 3 hours. I noticed that my sister, despite her bitching, walked perfectly fine in my high heels but seemed pissed at me all day. Finally, when we arrived back home, she pulled me aside. \n\n(pulling off my shoes and her stockings) Look! Look at what you did to my feet! \n\nThere were a few red blisters on the sides of her feet and toes. They looked uncomfortable but not unbearably so. I\u2019ve had blisters so I get it.\n\nBut I lost it.\n\n*I can\u2019t believe you! How dare you?!It\u2019s not all about you! You had a week to shop for shoes and didn\u2019t so don\u2019t blame me that you can\u2019t be bothered to look nice! I shouldn\u2019t have to dress you!*\n\nShe called me a bitch in front of my kids (10 and 7 years old.) \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m the asshole and that I \u201cmade her wear uncomfortable shoes.\u201d \n\nWell, am I?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThank you all for giving me some much needed perspective. \n\nI feel awful \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI just went down to her and sobbed. I hugged her tighter then I ever have in my life. I feel absolutely rotten inside and an even worse sister. I can\u2019t believe that I was such a selfish bitch that I let shoes get in the way of our mother. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that I let appearances get in the way of our family and I need to focus on how to move forward and strengthen our relationship.\n\nI want to crawl into a hole and die I\u2019m so ashamed of myself. \ud83e\udd2e", "created_utc": 1682314394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12x4o6z/aita_for_making_my_sister_wear_high_heels_for_my/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA!", "YTA\n\nFirst for deciding what your sister can and cannot wear. That's not your place or your business. \n\nThreatening to ban her from her own mother's funeral! WTF. As if that were even your place a tiny bit. YTA for that alone. \n\nThen for ignoring her when she said the heels were to high.\n\nAnd for insisting she wear shoes that were to small for her (who does that!!).\n\nAnd then for not apologizing like you should when you saw the blisters.  The fact that you've had them is irrelevant.  That was your choice.  \n\nFinally,  for your speech about her making it all about her. That was YOU.  You created the drama about the shoes. You caused this whole situation.  Not her. If she'd have just worn her own shoes,  then this wouldn't have happened. Any comments about neon tennis shoes would have been on her, not you. \n\nYou caused all this, YTA.  And your sister was right about what she called you.", "**YTA -** You are not the shoe police.  It would not have bothered your mother.", "YTA. Who gives a crap about what shoes she was wearing?! Not your mother, certainly. And whoever else attending the funeral who cared more about one of the mourning daughter's shoes than about her and their own grief, are assholes as you were. \n\nYou might be grieving, but that doesn't give you the right to boss your very adult sister around. And to make her feel guilty for not buying shoes?! Major asshole move. I'd dare say if my mother passes, going shopping would be the last thing in my mind. \n\nApologize to your sister for making your mother's funeral about shoes and forcing her to submit to your ridiculous demands on a day where she should've been focused on saying her last goodbye to her mother.", "YTA, your priorities are messed up\n\nIt\u2019s not fashion week it\u2019s a funeral\n\nAlso if you were wearing shoes that we\u2019re not as high you should haven worn the ones that were too high for her", "YTA\n\n31 is old enough to choose her own outfit.

No, the fact that she's living with you does not mitigate this.\n\nYTA for choosing the occasion of your mother's funeral to exercise the above form of assholery.\n\nYTA for, by your own admission, not caring that the shoes you gave her were too small for her.\n\nYTA for your dismissive judgment that she \"walked perfectly fine\" in them, as though your limited observation actually meant anything.\n\nYTA for your continued dismissal of her concerns after the fact, based on your own personal assessment that her blisters didn't look unbearable.\n\nYTA for, after all of the above, having the audacity to say to your sister \"It's not all-out you,\" when that is clearly the message you needed to heed for yourself.\n\nYTA for finishing your post by saying \"She thinks I\u2019m the asshole and that I 'made her wear uncomfortable shoes,'\" as though the fact that you did, in fact, make her wear uncomfortable shoes were up for any sort of debate.\n\nYTA for, in general, clearly caring more about your sister's appearance than her well being on one of the most difficult days of her life.\n\nFinally, meta-YTA for the fact that there was any doubt in your mind that all of the above makes you TA.

You blamed your sister for trying to make it all about herself, but.... you really made it all about you. Funerals arent about fashion statements, despite your best efforts. Tennis shoes, neon or not, shouldnt matter because your sister was going to the funeral to honor and grieve your mother (rest in peace). You chose to make her uncomfortable for hours and shame her for something that wasn't a big deal to anyone except you. Instead of bonding or sharing grief, you caused a completely unnecessary rift.", "Oh wow! \n\n\"well am I?\"... yes! Yes you are! \n\nShe told you they're too high, then when forced to wear them they're too tight but you didn't give a crap, you just wanted it your way! She even offered a solution but you have to have it your way and you continue to demand to control her and what she chooses to wear.\n\nYou shout at her saying she's making it all about her but it's you that made it all about you and how much you wanted to control her and how you demand this and demand that!\n\nYou had no right to tell her she couldn't go to her mother's funeral! No right whatsoever! \n\nYTA - A huge one! She's correct in her judgement of you at the end.\n\nEdit to add that you forced her to wear shoes that were painful which forced her to focus on how much pain she was in instead of focusing on mourning her mother... You took that away from her!", "YTA-\n\nbro what is wrong with you, what makes you think you can ban your grown a\\*\\* sister from attending her mom's funeral. I fell bad 4 ur sister bc she has to deal with this bs after her mom just died. \ud83d\ude44", "Yea YTA. Why are you more worried about what your sister is wearing than your mom\u2019s funeral. Get your priorities together. It doesn\u2019t matter what she\u2019s wearing. Just be there for each other.", "YTA - while yes, it was an emotional traumatic day - you made it about you and no one else.\n\nThis was never about the shoes - it was about grief - which does weird things to all of us. We expect people to somehow \"rise to the occasion\".\n\nGuess what - no one would have noticed or cared about her shoes but now this will cause a rift between the two of you if you don't apologize.\n\nYou are not the only grief stricken person here. Sis probably didn't think to get shoes because her mom died.", "Sorry for your loss, it\u2019s a difficult time for both of you. \n\nhowever YTA I don\u2019t think what footwear somebody has is really that important, being at the funeral is important.", "Truly sorry for the loss of your mother. \n\nIn this regard, YTA, tho. \n\nActually berating your sister over shoes is seriously stupid. Then forcing her to wear some fancy ass high heels? Wtf?\n\nAs a woman that never wears high heels, I can guarantee you that I'd have huge blisters and torn tendons because my ankles can not do high heels. You're lucky she only had blisters. \n\nIt's literally shoes. Who the hell cares what shoes she wore? Telling her she can't come to her mom's funeral because you don't like her shoes is really fucked up.", "YTA \n\nIf she wanted to wear her neon trainers then so what? You made a big deal out of nothing.", "YTA\n\n\nI know it's stressful. Your mother just passed unexpectedly. But so did hers. Fighting about something as small as the shoes you wear, something that is meant to get dirty and tread on dirt, is not worth it while you are this early in the grieving period. \n\n\nIf you'll be sitting like you said no one would really notice the shoes. During the funeral, no one would really be paying attention to it anyway. You should have let her just be comfortable in her sneakers on the day you both would be laying your mother to rest.\n\nThe second reason you gave for why you may be TA is correct. You put her under physical pain and discomfort while she's already dealing with emotional distress. And it was all completely unnecessary.\n\nEDIT to add: please apologize to her. Acknowledge your behavior as wrong. You lost a family member. You don't need to lose any more. This one hits close to home. Make amends. She shouldn't have called you a bitch in front of your kids but forcing her to wear the shoes that caused her pain while she was already in emotional pain may have threw her over the edge.", "YTA your priorities are seriously warped. You aren\u2019t concerned about your sister or your relationship, you are prioritizing appearances. Who are you to threaten your sister and tell her whether or not she\u2019s allowed at the funeral for her own mother? You are controlling and shallow and mean", "Yes, YTA \n\nYour sister is a grown adult and can wear what she wants. It doesn\u2019t matter if you wouldn\u2019t wear that or if you think it\u2019s tacky. Look, you\u2019re both grieving, you both may react in ways you wouldn\u2019t normally or do things you wouldn\u2019t normally do, and picking this hill to die on in the day of your mothers funeral was\u2026a bad idea.", "YTA. She\u2019s not a child", "YTA Who are you that you feel you can dress your adult sister?", "YTA, the family sets the tone for the funeral. Your sister, who is one of the few (if only) people in the word experiencing the same thing as you, decided that this was fine for her mothers funeral. That should be it. It was also really telling that you bring up her past problems as a way to show that she can\u2019t be trusted to make the correct decisions.", "Major YTA! Who made you God? It was a funeral, not a fashion show. I agree with your sister.", "This is so desperately over written that I assume it's someone faking for attention, but seriously: it's a funeral, everyone's grieving, nobody cares about what people have on their feet. YTA.", "YTA\nIt is really overwhelming and emotional when your mom dies. It really would have been fine to stop at a store for a few minutes to get a pair of shoes that actually fit or wear tennis shoes.  Your sister has had an incredibly rough time the last few years. Forcing her to wear shoes that hurt her feet and that she was not used to so she looked right to your standards or you would not allow her to come to her mother's funeral was pretty unkind. It was unkind to dismiss your sister's blisters as not that bad because you have had worse. \n\nI had to go buy shoes when my mom died. People don't always have things or realize they don't have things until last minute when there is a sudden death. There are more important things than how someone looks.", "Yta. You're a controlling ah. What would it matter what she was wearing on her feet. She had also lost her mother too", "\nYTA.   We had my mil funeral in January and  you know what nobody gave a fuck what anyone wore They turned up to grieve not a contest for best drss", "Yeah. \nYTA. \nYour sister really only wears tennis shoes. Suppose your mum is looking down on the ceremony and maybe she doesn\u2019t have the best view. I don\u2019t know, someone else had better seats on that cloud. Jesus maybe. \n\nThe point is, what if for your sister\u2019s row, all she can see is the guests feet. Now how can she be sure your sister was even there?\n\nOr maybe mum is off basking in the holy glory or maybe people just switch off when they die and Mom wasn\u2019t up there at all, in which case you made this all about you.", "Why the fuck are you acting like you have authority over your adult sister? YTA. Who cares what she decides to wear as long as it\u2019s not inappropriate.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry for you loss, but there\u2019s absolutely no reason she couldn\u2019t have worn her tennis shoes. It\u2019s not disrespectful to your mother\u2019s memory. Likely nobody would have cared but you.", "I'm sorry for your loss but  YTA", "YTA. JFC, they were shoes.", "YTA, So your sisters chance to say her goodbyes and get closure was overshadowed by you being overbearing and controlling combined with painful shoes.", "YTA. Why are you so dismissive of your sister. Do you realise she lost her mother too?", "YTA. I'm having a rule at my funeral that people can wear what they want as long as it's smart. Don't care if it's brightly coloured, don't care if they are wearing trainers. Just want people to be smartish but comfy. I don't own a pair of heels and I'm 48. I can't walk in them and they make everything hurt. If my sister forced me to wear a pair of heels at my mum's funeral, if that was literally the focus instead of allowing me to say goodbye to my mum wearing what I felt comfortable in on my feet,I'd seriously be questioning her priorities in that moment, especially when not only are they heels but they are too small! Apart from the blisters, do you have any idea how bad heels are for you? Not only will they kill your feet, they put your calf muscles into an unnatural position and then cause too much tension in your pelvic floor as a result. No woman should be wearing heels.", "YTA\n\n We get it, you have a louboutin pair of shoes. Congrats", "NAH - You're both still grieving and struggling to cope. \n\nFollowing OPs edit: Forgive yourself, forgive each other. This is a shitty time to get through but you do still have each other to lean on.\n\nMy own mother died last year - I've never been closer to my sister. Not since we shared a room as children. I wish you both all the best.", "YTA - Its just shoes.", "Err. Fighting over a pair of shoes during a funeral? Owh yes, what a way to remember your last farewell to your mother. YTA btw.", "YTA.", "ESH, but mostly you. \n\nI\u2019ll concede that neon tennis shoes aren\u2019t *the best* choice for a funeral. Your sister should have at least tried to find a black pair. I\u2019m also not crazy about her calling you a bitch in front of your kids. But that said, you have to realize that for a lot of people high heels aren\u2019t just uncomfortable, but actually unsafe.

Not even black jeans, but blue denim.  I was dieting and at the time of the wake was between sizes.  Every day I wore the elastic waist knit pants that I used for exercising.  When I dropped enough weight I bought another set of colors in the next size (or sometimes two sizes) down.  By that point I had lost 80 pounds and had more to lose.  I did not want to spend money on clothes that would not fit in another couple months.  The exercise pants were utterly unsuitable for attending a wake.  I had one pair of zippered pants that fit.  ONE.  Blue denim jeans.  The choice was to wear them or not go.  I decided to go wearing the jeans.  They were a bit loose, but washed and fresh out of the dryer I figured I had time at the wake before the fabric stretched and they became too baggy.  Sure enough as I am approaching the door to the funeral home a neighbor from down the block (dressed in a suit) sees me, looks up and down at my outfit, and gives me the side eye. I felt so self conscious but I I did not allow his dismissive attitude prevent me from walking in the door!  When it was my turn to speak to my neighbor\u2019s adult daughters I expressed my sympathy, mentioned their dad was the first person I met after moving into my townhouse, and related a story about their dad that had them laughing. Before saying goodbye I apologized to them for wearing jeans and I explained why.  They were so gracious and told me that it did not matter and they were just so glad I was there.

I\u2019ve felt pity for her because her life has been a disaster recently (toxic divorce, house, etc.) \n\nA couple weeks ago, my mother (70F) unexpectedly passed from an aneurism. I\u2019ve been absolutely devastated these past few weeks and so is my sister, obviously.\n\nThe funeral happened a few days ago, on Friday to be precise. Me, my husband, and the kids are all dressed and ready to go. I go downstairs to get my sister and she\u2019s dressed in a black skirt with stockings and a black suit jacket. All good right? \n\nWrong.\n\nShe has tennis shoes on over her black dress stockings. \n\nFUCKING NEON TENNIS SHOES.\n\nHere\u2019s our conversation:\n\n*Hey don\u2019t you have a pair of dressier shoes?*\n\nNo I only have tennis shoes. Sorry.\n\n*Ok well you\u2019re not wearing those. I have a pair of shoes you can borrow.*\n\nShe follows me upstairs and I go into my closet. Now, for dress shoes, I only have high heels. I don\u2019t like flats and have never worn flats in my entire adult life. The only black pair of dress shoes I have, besides the ones I\u2019m wearing for the funeral, are patent leather, stiletto-heeled Louboutin So Kate\u2019s. \n\nI grab them and hand them to my sister. She looks surprised. \n\n*Here make sure these fit.*\n\nThose are too high for me.\n\n*Just please wear them, sis.*\n\nCan\u2019t we just stop on the way so I can buy something lower?\n\n*No we are running late. You\u2019re seriously telling me you don\u2019t have a single pair of shoes that you can wear to a funeral?*\n\nI only really wear tennis shoes. I don\u2019t think I can walk in these.\n\n*Well you can\u2019t wear tennis shoes to  our mom\u2019s funeral!*\n\nThey\u2019ll murder my feet!\n\n*It\u2019s only one day! We\u2019ll be sitting for most of it!*\n\nDon\u2019t you have anything lower for me?\n\n*No sorry I only have the one pair that\u2019s black.*\n\nOh my good they look so uncomfortable!\n\n*If you don\u2019t wear the heels you\u2019re not coming.*\n\nFinally, she tries them on. They are too tight but I don\u2019t really care. Her feet fit in the shoes and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\n\nThe funeral was emotional. I broke down multiple times. Between the service and reception it lasted around 3 hours. I noticed that my sister, despite her bitching, walked perfectly fine in my high heels but seemed pissed at me all day. Finally, when we arrived back home, she pulled me aside. \n\n(pulling off my shoes and her stockings) Look! Look at what you did to my feet! \n\nThere were a few red blisters on the sides of her feet and toes. They looked uncomfortable but not unbearably so. I\u2019ve had blisters so I get it.\n\nBut I lost it.\n\n*I can\u2019t believe you! How dare you?!It\u2019s not all about you! You had a week to shop for shoes and didn\u2019t so don\u2019t blame me that you can\u2019t be bothered to look nice! I shouldn\u2019t have to dress you!*\n\nShe called me a bitch in front of my kids (10 and 7 years old.) \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m the asshole and that I \u201cmade her wear uncomfortable shoes.\u201d \n\nWell, am I?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can't be surprised when they are angry at you. You cannot be surprised when they no longer take you seriously. Cuz I know I wouldn't be able to. I would be more focused on grieving the person who has passed then worrying about whether or not my tennis shoes are inappropriate color.

You shouldn't really be caring about someone else's footwear choices when you're grieving the loss of someone you care about.\n\nNot to mention, if you're willing to risk imploding your relationship with your sibling over shoes for a funeral, then you don't get to be surprised when that's exactly what happens. You don't get to be surprised when they're mad or want nothing to do with you anymore. You do not get to control them.\n\nMaybe instead of focusing on what people are wearing to a funeral, you should focus more on working through your grief. That seems like the healthier option here.", "I went to my good friend's viewing in jeans and a nice shirt. Pretty sure I was wearing tennis shoes too. The deceased don't care what you're wearing. They're too dead to notice.", "As someone who lost her mother\u2026 Shut up. It is her mothers funeral. If all she could muster up was the energy to wear a bathrobe that would\u2019ve been fine.", "If you're more focused on someone's shoes then you are on grieving the person who has passed, then you need therapy. You need some serious help. I wouldn't be embarrassed I had my sister wearing neon tennis shoes to a funeral, because I would be more focused on the person who died and grieving that loss than I would on what my sister's wearing. But then again that's just me. I don't allow someone else's footwear choice at a funeral stop me from living my life or experiencing the funeral the way that I need to. Again if you do, then you need some serious psychological help. Because that's not something super important to get hung up over. Their shoes. Get over it. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nYou're telling me you would really risk imploding your relationship with your sibling over a pair of neon tennis shoes?", "I'm Jewish, so traditionally you're meant to wear something presentable, unless you're immediate family of the departed, in which case you wear something than can be torn.\n\nSome people wear black because it's become a cultural thing, but it's definitely not expected. Certainly not down to the shoes.\n\nI have attended many a funeral in jeans. But where I live, jeans with a nice shirt can be considered dress clothes \ud83d\ude05\n\nI can't imagine anyone being barred from a funeral over *shoes*.", "I absolutely love patent leather shoes, especially heels. But they are also the hardest leather to wear in and make comfortable at the best of times, let alone wearing someone else\u2019s that are too small! \n\nOP is definitely TA, and she has realised this. It\u2019s weird what we get hung up on though when we are under a lot of stress.", "Oh I am sure it\u2019s a nice basement. Possibly the Louboitin of basements. Surely anyone with those shoes obvious has 2 complete in-law apartments in their basements that are nicer than sis\u2019s last abode /s\n\nThat or OP ignored the bad construction of the sleeper sofa because well, it doesn\u2019t stop you from being horizontal, and the mold on the wall because contaminated air is breathable. All gases, like all things that can make it down the esophagus, are breathable once. Or at least a fraction of a breath. I would assume basement is in the \u201ckids had comfortable and safe sleepovers in the space regularly before\u201d zone but, well, we are on Reddit", "I think that is a lovely idea your grandmother had. And good on your family for honouring her wishes. \nI can't however agree on the 'she wouldn't have done it' part. We are talking about a woman who would rather be late for her mother's funeral and go buy confortable shoes than wear heals she doesn't like.", "To be fair, grief manifests in very strange ways and saying someone is seriously psychologically disturbed for it is a bit harsh. Ok she was an AH in how she managed the situation, but losing a parent is unbearable. \n\nMy father died of covid 2 years ago. He was a very traditional man and we wanted to bury him in his favourite dress suit. We weren\u2019t allowed to put him in clothes because no one would dress a covid patient. They did allow us to rest it on top of him, but for some reason it really upset me. Obviously with hindsight, it didn\u2019t matter what he was wearing, he wouldn\u2019t know any different, but my dad never went anywhere without being appropriately dressed and at the time I felt like it was disrespectful to him. I was in the beginning stages of my grief and little things that aren\u2019t really that important, felt far bigger than they were.", "Heels she doesn\u2019t like and heels that are painful and too small at entirely different things", "I literally do not know anybody who would care more about somebody's footwear than they would about grieving the person who passed. If that is seriously the thing you're focusing on, then yes you do need some serious psychological help.\nI really don't know anybody who's grief manifests in caring more about their siblings footwear for the funeral then they do about having their sibling there. I don't know anybody who would threaten to revoke their siblings right to go to their parents' funeral over some neon tennis shoes. If you know someone like that, then I would suggest getting some help.\n\nYes grief can manifest in a number of ways, but that does not always mean that those ways are healthy. That does not mean that those ways are always okay. And sometimes you need to recognize that your way of grieving is not healthy or okay for you, or for anyone around you, and that you need some help for it. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging that either.\n\nHaving a specific way of grieving isn't what makes you TA. Forcing your sibling, to wear shoes that not only made them uncomfortable, but physically injured them, And then continuing to defend yourself afterwards, does.", "I mean to me all heels are painful and they are not something you wear out of pleasure but out of obligation or for the sake of propriety. \nShe should have made sure she had something appropriate to wear. Again if it's tennis shoes so be it, as long as they are not bloody neon but black. Or even white honestly. Just not neon.", "I mean, the shoes were neon, if they were black she might have got away with it, but I know in my family it would be seen as disrespectful, and at least one person in the family would have asked the sister if she needed some shoes\n\nI've had several close family members pass, and I would want to show them the respect in death I had for them in life"]}
