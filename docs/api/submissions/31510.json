Free your parents from thinking they have to do holiday things for the family.

Stop doing it.", "When my kids were little, we often did 2 (sometimes 3) thanksgiving and Christmas events so everyone could \u201csee/be seen\u201d on the holiday. By the end of the day the kids and I were all tired and cranky. So do yourself a favor and do your own dinner with your wife and kids, keeping it as low key and relaxing as you can for a change.

You get to **plan your own holidays**!!\n\nIt's true that family gatherings are important to many people, and if that's true then holidays can be a good way to do that. It's also true that **everything is harder with kids**, so if you aren't up for it while they are little, that's fine! Every family is different. When my daughter was tiny, there were lots of good caregivers (grandmas and aunts) who craved baby time, so having her along was super easy. But I know that's not true for everyone.\n\nWhat's more, some people have **family situations that are just stressful**. (A mentally ill Dad? I'm so sorry.) And in that case, controlling the amount of contact is fine. Zero contact may be necessary, but even if not that, doing visits in smaller groups or lower stress situations may be the best thing.\n\nFinally, feel free to **invite friends if that makes Thanksgiving better**. My thanksgiving this year will be small and will have half family and half friends. I'm not saying you have to. I'm just saying that you shouldn't feel guilty if you choose that over the stressful family event.", "NTA \n\nEnjoy it!!", "NTA.

You and your wife can have establish whatever kind of holiday traditions that you like.   I come from a family that always has extremely elaborate holiday celebrations.  A long time ago (like 50 years ago) I decided that I really dislike elaborate, expensive holiday celebrations.   As a couple, my husband and I have elected to have more relaxed family holidays.   We have a nice setup, but the tree and decor are simple, we use our regular dishes because the fancy china is up in a cupboard and us too heavy for us to get down, wash and dry by hand, set out, and then rewash, dry, and out up in the high  cupboards just for one meal.  We are old, with health and mobility problems, so we\u2019re continuing to do it our minimalist way.   \n\n   We have been criticized by our more distant relatives, but then, they can do their own thing.   This year, our Thanksgiving has the four members of our immediate family, and and we will all have a wonderful time.   The turkey will taste just as good on our every day plates.", "NTA, and spending a holiday with your wife and kids, is spending time with family.", "YWBTA\n\nIf you try to force your family against their wishes.", "NTA\n\nIt was very hard to convince our families that we wanted OUR traditions to start.

Eventually everyone got the idea and we were \"allowed\" to enjoy our time.", "i mean celebrating genocide to any degree makes you irredeemable.", "YTA", "Absolutely NTA.  Sometimes the best thing you can do is start your own family traditions.  \n\n* One of my favorites is to buy a plain white tablecloth and have the kids put their handprint on it in permanent paint, then write their name and age.  Do this every year and you'll have a wonderful keepsake.\n* We name the turkey every year.  I think it was Boochimoo last year, and Ebenezer the year before.\n* The adults sip mimosas while everyone is in their PJs for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade on TV.  (Followed by the dog show)\n* My brother puts up his Christmas tree, I do ours on Saturday.\n\nJust stay home and have a relaxing day.  Happy Thanksgiving!!", "No need to tell anyone anything.
