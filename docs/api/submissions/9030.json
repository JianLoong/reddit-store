But all 3 of you agreed to not pay more than $140?\n\nSo when you sent that message did Michelle respond and say \"yes the $200/$300 is fine, grab one\" and Laura never responded? Or did Neither of them respond and you just decided two tickets would be fine?", "I'm actually gonna go against the grain here and say NAH *as long as you don't expect or force Michelle to actually take the ticket*. If you offer it to her and she says \"No sorry, it's above the price limit we discussed,\" you have to accept that with grace and without pushing. \n\nAs a huge Beyonc\u00e9 fan, I'm on your side with the decision to buy the tickets - what, were you supposed to admit defeat and not go to this tour *at all* just because you couldn't find the perfect number of tickets for the perfect price with the exact group of people you originally discussed with? You made a decision for yourself that you were willing to pay 200, so you did. Great. Now you also have an extra ticket at that same price. If neither Laura nor Michelle want it, which is understandable given your earlier discussion on price, you can either 1) offer to subsidize it to one of them so it only costs them the 140 discussed, 2) shop it around to your other friends or 3) resell it and go alone. All of these options are perfectly acceptable and you might be surprised at how many people would take you up on 2. I know I'd be thrilled if someone offered me a ticket to the Renaissance tour for only 200.\n\nIt's not like there were 3 tickets available for 140 and you intentionally bought more expensive ones just to mess with your friends. It was 2 tickets for 200 or nothing, and as long as you don't think your friends HAVE to pay you for them, you're in the clear. Hell, I'd even say you were a good friend here as you were willing to do the stressful work of waiting in the ticket line and figuring out the online purchase under time pressure. None of your other friends were willing or able to do that.", "NTA, on the proviso that you don't force Michelle to pay for her ticket.  \nIt's not like seats were available at \u00a3140 and you thought \"No, the \u00a3200 seats are better, let's get them\".

You could have handled the communication a little better - if I know someone is trying to book me expensive tickets, I'd make damn sure that I was either available or had clearly communicated my boundaries (and assured the buyer that I was willing to loose out on the tickets if the cost goes above) but that's a responsibility of the group and not you as an individual.", "Let\u2019s!", "That\u2019s really good advice please thank your wife and thank you for sharing. \n\nI don\u2019t think I will do the booking in the future it is a lot of pressure and I\u2019ve hurt a friend which is as far from my intentions as I wanted.

Then you guys end up with tickets that are 1) over budget and 2) she\u2019s not included. I 100% understand she\u2019s mad, I would be too. I also understand you not risking it cause you were buying the tickets. But what I don\u2019t understand is not getting Michelle a ticket KNOWING you can resell this ticket easily if she really did not have the money. There\u2019s almost NO financial risk here. That would have made a big difference for me and that\u2019s what I would have done!

It's Beyonc\u00e9!", "Yes", "Then absolutely NTA \n\nBuying tickets is stressful and time consuming. Your job was to communicate the cost and get an okay before purchasing. Enjoy the concert!", "NAH. Honestly, I don\u2019t even think there is a conflict here. You tried to get three tickets for the agreed upon price and couldn\u2019t. You managed to get only two tickets for a different price and couldn\u2019t get a third. No one has complained about the situation or your decision.", "NTA, but next time you probably should make your intentions a little bit clearer. Obviously you're a huge fan and there's nothing wrong with that, but to me when everybody agrees the limit is 140 that means either you get three tickets for 140 or nobody goes. Getting two tickets for 200 and taking Michelle could come across as you \"ditching\" Laura (btw why did michelle get the second ticket and not Laura?) .\n\nYou should have probably told your friends from the start that you would go no matter the price, but if you found tickets<140 you would buy them some tickets too. That way nobody feels left out.\n\nAdditionally you really can't expect Michelle to accept a ticket of 200 when she told you her limit was 140. So still NTA, but be prepared to have either wasted 200 on an extra ticket or for Michelle to only pay you 140 for it.", "INFO: Because of the comments i have the feeling i'm not getting the question straight.

OP's a huge Beyonc\u00e9 fan and this is B's first tour in 5 years (and first solo tour in 7 years), and so the solution to not finding tickets at their friend's price point is to deprive themselves of having a once-in-a-lifetime experience?\n\nYou must either not be a live music fan or not have any friends because this take is absolutely otherworldly in how little common sense it displays.", "I believe Michelle was the one OP was planning with from the start", "They clearly meant \"wasn't\" instead of \"was\", come on now", "Then reply to them and let them know about their typo instead of criticizing me for taking their words for how they're written.", "It's 2023, if you can't work out typos by now then, idk.
