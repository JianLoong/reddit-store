{"id": 31743, "submission_id": "183x9up", "title": "AITA for not giving my cousin money for Christmas?", "selftext": "My (f38) father passed away last year, and my brother (m35) and I both inherited about $100,000. With the money, both of us have paid down debt, started a business, and I set up IRA and 529 accounts for me, hubby, and our two small children. My dad\u2019s side of the family is, and has always been, somewhat poor. So, my brother and I have helped them out a bit as well. For example, we gave my aunt (my dad\u2019s sister) $10,000, and paid the funeral expenses for our other aunt when she passed away last August. My cousin (the daughter of the aunt who died), was taking care of my aunt full time and was being paid by the state to do so. She now refuses to get a job, saying she can\u2019t be away from her kids (three girls, all teenagers). She is not a single mother - her husband (the father of the girls) works full time. She now messages me constantly, saying how poor she is, and how she can\u2019t afford to buy her kids Christmas presents, and commenting that it must be nice for me to have money and be able to buy presents for my kids. My remaining aunt recently reached out to me and suggested that I give my cousin more money so that she can buy her girls Christmas presents and pay some bills. My aunt also said that my cousin had asked her to reach out to me, because I seemed to not have \u201ctaken the hint\u201c when she had messaged me herself. I really don\u2019t want to give her money. I already gave her thousands of dollars when I paid for her mother\u2019s memorial service and cremation. Plus, I think she could easily get a seasonal job, or any other kind of job for that matter, and she refuses. I honestly don\u2019t see how her lack of funds is my problem at this point. I also don\u2019t want to continue to set a precedent that I am an ATM, and can just give her money whenever she feels she needs it. My aunt and other cousins say that a few hundred more won\u2019t break the bank. I want to add that my husband and I both work full-time, and although we can afford to pay bills and put food on the table, we are most certainly not wealthy. So what do you all think? Should I give her a few hundred more dollars to help with with Christmas? Would I be the a-hole for saying no?", "created_utc": 1700956701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183x9up/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousin_money_for_christmas/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
