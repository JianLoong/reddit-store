I believe legal age is 18", "Then you are an adult.  Here is a partial list of things that your parents cannot legally do anymore.  READ ALL THE WAY TO THE END BEFORE ACTING ON THIS INFORMATION.\n\n1. View your grades unless you give permission (this law is known under the acronym FERPA).\n\n2. Restrict your movements, e.g. by forbidding you to leave their home.  They may, based on their behavior toward you, attempt to get you back into their home by calling the cops on you if you leave.  But if that happens, all you have to do is tell the cops how old you are.\n\n3. Take away your possessions.  If they paid for them, the items are gifts.  If you paid for them, they are yours 100 percent.  In either case that's theft.\n\n4. Withhold your vital documents such as your birth certificate and Social Security card.  This last is not specifically illegal in all jurisdictions--but check.\n\n5. Restrict your communications with others.\n\n6. Know anything about your medical situation unless you give specific written permission (this one is called HIPAA).\n\nNow.  In a functional, supportive family, the parents already know this stuff or feel embarrassed if they have to be reminded of it but back off.  This is not what's happening here.

Get your parents out of your information loop.  If they have your passwords to your email, phone, etc., replace as many of these channels as possible and hide the replacements.  Protonmail address, cheapie PAYG phone, etc.\n\n2. End your reliance on them.  See other replies for some info.  In particular, go to the administration at your college.  I guarantee that they will not be surprised by your description of your nutty helicopter-octopus parents.  They may even have written protocols for this situation already.  Ask about financial aid, etc.\n\n3. Don't go back there.  Find somewhere else to live during school breaks.  It's not your home anymore.

Basically *everything* will be blocked if you don't give the college permission to share it with a specific person. \n\nBefore you do this, though, talk to financial aid to get your finances sorted out to make sure you can continue your studies once your parents cut you off. (And, unfortunately, they will.) It may be a bit complicated, but I can guarantee you that you aren't the first person who has had to talk to them so you could continue your studies because of abusive parents.", "NTA. They are awful. Honestly you\u2019d be better off finding a job and paying your own way through college. That may seem impossible but lots of people do it. Take some community college course (they\u2019re cheaper) and then you can transfer to university and take those credits with you to get your bachelor\u2019s for cheaper. Self study and take the, I can\u2019t remember the name, test that allows you to get the credits for that class at a reduced price since you don\u2019t have to take the class. \n\nThere are options for you.  Find out from your university what you can do. The abuse needs to end. \n\nSo sorry that you are going through this. You will be okay.", "INFO:  Is 19 an adult where you live?", ">\"reconsider some of the \u201cfreedoms\u201d that they allowed me to have.\"\n\nAsk them to show you on the schedule where this freedom is at.", "NTA. I feel like it is clear by similar comments but this is incredibly unhealthy. You are 19. Legally, they have no control over your life. I realize they are probably paying for college but it is not worth it if you can\u2019t even study what you want to. As others have mentioned, you have options. You have the right to live the life YOU want to. I\u2019d start by cutting your parents out of your life.", "If you go home for the \u201cmeeting\u201d, you will regret for the rest of your life. There are many good advices in these comments. Try to follow them and get your life under your control. You need to realize these people you call parents, they are not on your side.", "What state are you in?", "Nta\nIf your in America consider going in the military. I did that to get away frommy parents.", "*They will have no power other than what you choose to give them.*\n\nWhile I agree with the rest of the comment you made, this is not something you should say to abuse survivors. It can come across as victim blaming. \n\nUnfortunately, at the moment, these people *do* have power over OP. That doesn't mean that the rest of your comment isn't good advice. It absolutely and completely is. And I have that OP can take the steps she needs to take to GTFO.", "Excellent advice. I would just add, if your college or community has a shelter or counseling office for battered women, you should go there for advice and resources.", "This. Your parents are absolutely controlling but if they're paying your bills then there's a lot less you can do. \n\nYou have two options--play along, like the poster above says, or go it completely alone, which would involve paying your own way.", "I can\u2019t join the military. I have a bunch of health issues that disqualify me from even enlisting", "All excellent advice!", "It\u2019s empowerment not victim blaming to realize that they cannot be forced to do anything anymore. There\u2019s no more \u201cthey forced me\u201d and blind obedience. There\u2019s only \u201cthey didn\u2019t force me, they can\u2019t force me, I chose to do that  and next time *I can choose not to do that.*\u201d  To know you have a choice is empowering.  It\u2019s controlling your own life. It\u2019s your freedom.", "Clearly, you aren't quite aware how you're coming across.", "How do your parents know about your grades/major? I don't know your jurisdiction but I know in Canada and most schools in the US, they legally cannot send your information to your parents. I'd look into that and if not, find a way to prohibit the University from communicating with them. \n\nI specifically tell my students (this happens to them a lot) that they can change majors etc without telling their parents and then \"surprise them\" on graduation day with an \"oops, I thought I'd mentioned it\" \n\nNTA", "NTA. I concur with the top advice you are getting. Please don't be afraid to get cut off from their financial support. It is drastic and not easy, but it's better to navigate the financial stuff than it is to have your life derailed by their choke-hold on your life. It sounds like they may decide to marry you off to someone whether you like it or not.\n\nI know a young woman who (for different reasons) is suddenly navigating college without her parents' financial support. Other relatives (grandparents, aunts) are helping her however they can, as are old neighbors/parents of her friends. She managed to show documentation to FAFSA to be declared independent so that her financial aid will not assume any parental support. She had to switch colleges for a year, and she works part-time when she's not in class; but she is doing great - straight A's. You will be amazed at what you can do. Just don't be afraid to let folks you trust know what is going on with you. Talk to a school counselor; they may be able to connect you with even more resources - or even counseling to help you navigate everything.", "NTA, but down this path lies difficult options.\n\nDo what they say.\nGet really good at making them believe you are doing what they are saying even if they don\u2019t.\nSeparate finances from them and pay your own way. Yes, it sucks. But Many years out, I\u2019m kinda glad I finally went down that path, large student loans or not.", "Another option might be to leave school and get a job. Live on your own until your old enough to get college financing without your parents income and then return to school. This depends on the country your in too. As soon as you can go NC or LC with them as they will never stop trying to run your life.", "Shunning is not part of LDS doctrine or church wide practice. Are there terrible, excessive people who do cut their children out of their lives? Absolutely. I know several people well who had to go through that. But it is not a practice that is named and practiced as it is in the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses or Scientology.", "My parents make sure they\u2019re present when any sort of HIPPA form or any other consent form is signed so they can make sure they\u2019re on it. They will also frequently call places to make sure that they still have access to all my information", "I just looked this up out of curiosity, and the second article was suggesting that because human trafficking is still frightfully real that parents teach their children this so that if at any point they become a victim of trafficking they can use this trick.", "LDS is as bullshit as any other religion; except that they\u2019re worse than average. There are absolutely sects of Mormons that shun. They\u2019re as wrong as every religion, and they\u2019re as culty as JW. This is not the point of this sub, or my comment, so I\u2019ll leave it there.\n\nEdit: **AND** there are absolutely mainstream LDS families that shun, not just with the approval of the church, but at the insistence of it. Don\u2019t lie.", "I've always heard that it's an idea that's pretty unreliable and haphazard, compared to just telling anyone at the airport you're being kidnapped.", "I would seriously urge everyone to please understand the situation OP is facing and not to cross post this anywhere.", "You just described my mom", "Make arrangements to become financially independent.   You might have to take out student loans or pick up a part time job but mental health is priceless. \n\nWhen the time is right, call everyone who you gave your parents permission to watch over you with, and revoke your parents access.", "Omg, OP, that's scary! You may have to sneak around a bit, it might feel awful, but it's important. Get new accounts with a different bank they don't know about and start squirrelling money away any way you can that they won't notice. Get a second phone they don't know about, pretend to follow the schedule but instead get a job to help build up your new accounts. Do whatever you need to secure your money and your accounts, and then revoke their access to everything all at once like other posters have described, once you're able to be safe doing it", "Yes, me too."]}
