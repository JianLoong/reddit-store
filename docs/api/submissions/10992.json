You're an adult. Talk to your counselor at school about getting a co-op or internship so you can pay your own way. If you defy your parents, they'll probably cut you off financially.

With marriage - emphasize that you need to focus on graduating. If you are not dependent on them for money then tell a college counselor and get support in  going LC.

I had a controlling mother myself who would try to micromanage until I snapped and basically told her that either she accepts my decisions as mine and we could have a relationship or she could try to keep up the current behavior and I would walk away for good. I don't think you were in the wrong here. We should all be able to make our own choices as adults!", "^ all of this, OP.\n\nIt might feel drastic to you right now, but it\u2019s much better to be safe than sorry. In the meantime, as someone else above noted, play along with your parents.

If you end up at the airport against your will, use the washroom and stick the spoon in your underpants so it gets picked up by security. They will take you to a private room for an interview.\n\nIf you think they may force you home or try to keep you there, you may also want to have a set safety plan with a trusted friend who will contact authorities if you are not heard from on a pre-agreed schedule or if you give a distress message.\n\nThis sounds extreme but people who have major control issues like this sometimes do not respond rationally or proportionally to a loss of that control.
