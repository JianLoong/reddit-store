I've only been to Mary's restaurant once, but this was years ago, so when my friend suggested we try there because she's heard good thing's I was down. \n\nWe didn't have a reservation, and the place did look pretty busy, but surprisingly we were able to get a table within like 10 minutes on the upper level of the restaurant by the bar. Mary was helping out at the front of the restaurant seating people and was the one who took us to our seats. We said our hello's and had our small talk and she assured us the we'll be taking care of, and that if we need anything to let her know.\n\nSo we're sitting there for a good 15-20 minutes waiting for our server to greet us and take our drink orders and no one comes. We're both getting impatient so I flag down another server that I saw and asked her if our server was going to come take our orders because we've been here for a good 15-20 mins.\n\nShe's like \"yep someone will be with you shortly\".\n\nAnother 5-10 minutes go by and finally someone comes to take out order and we finally get our drinks. \n\nI kid you not another 25-30 mins went by and our server did not come over to us once. Not to offer us a refill, not to see if we wanted food, nothing. We tried waving her down a few times and she kept assuring us she'd be with us shortly, but never came.\n\nI understand that the restaurant was busy and she had other tables, but imo 25-30 mins with no service is just unacceptable. \n\nSo I waved down another server once again and asked her if someone was going to be over to serve us, because I couldn't locate our server. She once again was like \"someone will be with you shortly\".\n\nSo at this point my friend and I are fed up, and starving. So we put our jackets on to leave and walk up to the bar to ask for our bill. One of the other servers brings us our will which came up to like $18 for both drinks. I slap a $20 bill on the table and we start walking out (my friend e-transferred me her half). \n\nWe end up leaving to go eat elsewhere and I get a text from Mary asking why we were so rude to her server and didn't tip?\n\nI explained to her that the service was horrible, and due to that we did not stay and I did not give a proper tip to the server. She said that I was downright rude and disrespectful. I told her I'm not tipping for shitty service.\n\nShe thinks I'm an AH for this and is currently not speaking to me. She told two of our other friends and they both think that it was rude for me to not tip the server, and to just walk out. My friend who was with me at the restaurant agrees with me.

Plus if the bill was 18 and you left a 20 you technically did tip 11%", "NTA\n\nYou tipped 10% ish on drinks service, you didn't receive food service.", "NTA. You don't get paid or tipped for work you didn't do. That server did not work for you. Even for terrorible service, I tip 18% minimum because I don't know if someone's just having a bad day and I did my share of being a server in college so I feel empathy. But what you got wasn't terrible service. It was *no service.* you shouldn't pay for something you never got. NTA in the slightest.", "NTA, she should take this as a lesson that none of her customers should ever wait even close to that long to be served. She should either hire better/more servers or reduce the seating.", "NTA- I have worked in restaurants and understand that being a server can be very stressful when busy, but 30 minutes of sitting with only one drink and no one taking your order is ridiculous. Your friend as the manager should be walking around and making sure customers are happy and have been taken care of. I have a hard time tipping less than 20% due to the fact that I have been a server but if my service is shitty I have tipped less. Also restaurant employees should be a team and helping each other if that means cleaning a table for another server getting a drink or drink order taking a meal order or even delivering the food. It sounds like the restaurant needs more training on its staff.", "the server did nothing tip worthy NTA", "NTA and honestly this was a the perfect time to leave a penny tip. \n\nThat way you let them know that you didn't forget, but that the service was so shitty and that you'll never be back at that place again.", "NTA - I know most people defend tipping in the US as people use it to make a living but it was one of the fallouts from ending Slavery that allowed Slave owners to find a way to not pay their freed Slaves. Many of the Railroads refused to operate if they had to pay their emancipated slaves a livable wage and were allowed to require passengers in the dining cars to offset that by tipping. As the railroad was the backbone of the US they had a lot of power at the time and it has become a standard practice.  This is also why we don't see tipping the same way in most of the world. \n\nIt's one other way that the people at the bottom are pitted against each other rather than having the people at the top pay. I really think we need to move away from tipping as a practice. \n\nBefore people say I don't tip will add my standard when I go anywhere is 20% but that can fluctuate based on service. Down if its bad and up if it is good. I do not tip for takeout.", "Tip them for what? Your drinks? \n\nNTA. Former server and I'm telling you that was very unacceptable. If they knew you had already been waiting so long for your drinks they should have taken your order on the spot, no excuses for the additional wait.

This is the hospitality game. If your FRIENDS of all people had that bad of an experience and weren\u2019t shy ab expressing it I would take that feedback VERY seriously. Usually the friends over tip and pour on the praise. \nMary is too immature to be running a restaurant if this is how she handles dissatisfied customers. No maam.\n\nAnd I hope you tell her this too. She needs to be called out. \nHonestly if she keeps it up go leave a google review and say the owner was confrontational and aggressive when you left $1 tip on a $9 drink and went somewhere else\nTo eat.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s insane thinking that that kind of service deserves a tip. It doesn\u2019t deserve even those two dollars imo. Mary needs to step up her game as manager. \n\nIf the restaurant was too full and Mary was trying to be kind by finding you space, she should have said that there would be super slow service because they were packed and wether that would be fine.", "NTA as someone who waitresses, hosted and managed you did the right thing.yes they were busy but if they don't have the staff they shouldn't have sat you.", "NTA\n\nBad service doesn't deserve tipping", "NTA. You actually still did leave a tip, despite the shitty service. 30min without even taking your order or offering a drink refill? I would have walked out too.", "NTA....I used to waitress for years. It's completely unacceptable to wait around that long for someone to come even recognize your table let alone to place a drink order or food order. And you did tip, the bartender. You weren't rude, your server was non-existent.   \nI've left .99 before for a tip because of the awful service we received.", "NTA, I'm a career server, and had I given service that bad, I wouldn't even expect you to leave me anything.", "NTA. However, I may be culturally biased as I'm from the UK and we only tip if the service is good. \n\nThe tipping culture I've experienced in the States is crazy, particularly in coffee shops that wanted a tip when all they'd done at that point was charge me. The fact it seems to have gone up to a standard 20% is also bewildering. \n\nI appreciate your labour laws mean you can pay servers practically nothing but if the service itself is bad, I'm not tipping.", "NTA.  Tipping is fucking unreal now with expectations.  Shitty service=Shitty or no tip simple as that.  I'd be telling her to work on her shitty service and not shifting blame to you.", "NTA. I used to serve in a country with tipping culture and I can assure you that I would not have expected a tip in that situation. Your 10% was generous. Although, I don\u2019t think I would have been in that situation in the first place. If you\u2019re in the weeds, you ask for help. You don\u2019t just ignore your guests.", "NTA.  Tipping is conditional, not an obligation. If you get crappy service then you are within your rights to express your concerns via a 0.01 cent tip.", "I understand her not agreeing but the not speaking to you seems unnecessary. I do understand why you did what you chose to do.", "as someone who has waitressed for years, NTA. \n\na tip is earned. she didn\u2019t earn it. period.", "NTA And I hate when servers say, you food is almost ready, or somebody will take your order soon without checking.\n\nI guess 90% of the time they are right and it saves them time. Problem is 10% of the time they just keep repeating the same line while nobody realises something has gone wrong.", "NTA, when you delivered 1 beverage in 45 minutes, you basically didn't have a table, and if you don't get a tip, it's because there was (apparently) no one sitting there, based on your effort.", "NTA. You never even got to ask for the food, why on earth would you tip?", "NTA.  Confucius say, 'Shitty service deserves shitty tip', regardless of who owns the establishment.", "NTA. Also a former server and I honestly wonder if your server knew you were friends of Mary and as a result, didn\u2019t worry about you as much as their other tables. Did it seem like other people were waiting that long?", "NTA, you received poor service even for a busy restaurant, your friend is over reacting.", "NTA. That's horrible and your friend should be more concerned for the service than if a server gets no tip because they did no work", "NTA you DID tip your server, more than 10%. I would be waiting for my 2 bucks change", "I probably would have left without paying for the drinks. It would have ben at least 30 minutes before they realized you were gone.", "soft NTA\n\nWhere I'm from, we don't implement tips. If a place ever does have a tip jar by chance, it's not expected to put anything in there, but it's used as a nice way to get rid of some extra change you have lying around. \n\nIt shouldn't be up to the customer to pay on top of the services they were provided. If Mary believes her workers are entitled to tips so that they can live decently, then she can clearly pay them more as their boss and not put the onus on the customer. And if she can't afford to give her employees a livable wage, she shouldn't be running a business. \n\nAs a customer, the only thing you owe the employees there is your respect and good manners, and vice versa. But I wonder if you treated the waitress all that great.\n\nThe waitress here is clearly being overworked and underpaid. It's important to have some compassion for the worker. As the saying goes, don't shoot the messenger. Her lack of good service is a sign of a toxic work culture that refuses to compensate their workers appropriately and leaves them out to fend for themselves. I doubt she's getting any support either. In other words, she's trying her best with what she's been given. \n\nYour friend however, total hypocrite and bad boss.

They see literally when you sat and when items are rang in...it's easy to feel more time has passed ) then AND Mary didn't explain she sat you guys out of rotation and you weren't rude to the servers you stopped....you wouldn't be an ahole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
