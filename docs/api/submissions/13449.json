My (25F) wedding is in a month and I sent out the prospective seating chart to my bridal party which includes my bridesmaids and my immediate family. The bride and groom\u2019s parties are seated at the front at long tables for both the ceremony and reception. It makes things easier since there are a lot of moving parts. The rest of the guests are seated at small circular tables.\n\nMy brother Noah (28M) was upset that his ex wife Flora (31F) wasn\u2019t seated with him like the other spouses. \n\nThey got divorced two years ago after Noah said that Flora was an emotionless mannequin who had no time or energy for him. Our family was stunned because Flora always seemed loving though her calmness is sometimes a little too stoic. I think his friends are to blame. My mom loved Flora. About a year ago, Flora had a car accident where she passed out behind the wheel and drove into a tree in her backyard. It turns out she had a disease that affected her heart and her body. It was a miracle that she was even able to function as long as she did. She looked fine if a bit underweight but she was close to death.\n\nNoah and our mom threw themselves into helping Flora. He drives her everywhere, makes all her specialized meals, does the chores, makes the doctors appointments. He really stepped up. They recently got remarried so Flora can be on his health insurance rather than hers, although it\u2019s just a marriage on paper. My mom\u2019s still upset about that. \n\nI made sure that the venue was aware of Flora\u2019s needs, so she\u2019s seated close to an exit for fresh air, has the right dietary food, and a person there to help her if need be (edit: a CNA/nurse). \n Flora hasn\u2019t asked for anything. Noah, however, says that he needs to be seated next to her to take care of her needs. I\u2019ve already taken care of Flora\u2019s needs and I don\u2019t want gossip on why they\u2019re sitting together when they\u2019re divorced on my wedding day, so I told him no. He threw a fit and said neither of them would come to the wedding. My mother is begging me to reconsider but she wants them to get back together. AITA?\n\nEdit: most people, including our friends and extended family, don\u2019t know about Flora\u2019s health issues or that Noah\u2019s been taking care of her or that they are legally remarried. Our family and friends are a gossipy bunch and it will definitely be the talk of the party rather than my wedding. \n\nMy mom knows the ins and outs of Flora\u2019s illness and I talked with her on what Flora needed. She is invited as my mother\u2019s and my guest officially\n\n I sent her a list of what\u2019s I\u2019ve prepared and asked if she needed anything. She just said thanks and she\u2019s excited for the wedding. But to be honest, Flora\u2019s not the one to ask for accommodations anyways which is why I had my mom make sure we covered everything.", "created_utc": 1680057494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aopn/aita_for_not_seating_my_brother_and_his_ex_wife/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seriously? Nothing says more you\u2019re part of my family than taking care of someone\u2019s life and remarrying them to ensure they are taken care of.

What a love story!", "YTA. There\u2019s nothing worse than being seated at a wedding away from a spouse.

And it sounds as if your brother is being a responsible caregiver and loving husband, making great sacrifices for her well-being.\n\nAnd now you're going to act as if none of this is true?  Refuse to acknowledge how your brother is, now, a model of the responsibility that a spouse promises \"in sickness or in health\"?\n\nCaregivers are not interchangeable.  If your brother is her primary caregiver, some random person is not going to know how to help her in the same way.  \n\nYou should have discussed this with both your brother and sister-in-law before making the seating chart, and made the arrangements they want and need, not just jumped to conclusions about what was best.", "INFO: does flora know anyone else there?

Even if people do talk about them, you and your partner will still be the focus! You\u2019re getting married! Even if they\u2019re not assigned to sit together they may still end up sitting together as people mingle, they may dance, etc. It would be focus on your joy and work on letting this go than trying to keep them apart (which is probably not going to work) and preventing gossip (definitely not going to work).", "YTA even if their marriage is for convenience only, how is having ex-spouses being friendly at the same table gossip fodder.

What are you going to do when they are dance together, talk, leave together, etc?

Regardless of *any* of that, he's her caregiver - *by his choice.* Why does that bother you so much to the point that you've literally gone out of your way to create physical distance between them when you're the one in control? \n\nIt sounds like for some reason another you don't like, or otherwise \"approve of\" how they are handling their situation (which has nothing to do with you, and from all appearances, doesn't have an impact on any aspect of your life), and are taking it out on them via seating arrangement. \n\n\\- - -\n\nINFO - you state that they're divorced, and then mention that \"they recently got remarried... although it's just a marriage on paper.\"\n\nAre they married or not?

Why haven\u2019t you seated me next to my legal husband, who is my primary caregiver and more attuned to my physical and emotional state than the random CNA that you hired in an attempt to look thoughtful without having to potentially sacrifice an ounce of attention during your sPeCiAl DaY? Moreover, you\u2019ve taken away my ability to be close to one of the few people in the WORLD, let alone at your wedding, who knows the severity of my illness and will know exactly what I need while also knowing that I want to be subtle about my health in public. You\u2019re a selfish prick and YTA.\u201d\n\nEDIT: Also\u2026 you do realize that guests are allowed to get out of their seats, right? Lmao. Like, there\u2019s a very good chance that Noah and Flora are going to end up spending most of the reception together after dinner based on how you\u2019ve described their current relationship. Two exes talking?! Oh my! Your friends/family/guests are STILL going to gossip no matter where you seat them so you might as well let them be comfortable.", "YTA. You sound exhausting and controlling. It would be one thing if they\u2019d asked to sit separately, but if they actually want to sit together, that should be enough. If I were your brother, I probably wouldn\u2019t go either.", " NTA per your edits\n\nSeems like dramalama going on with them keeping their remarriage a secret and your mom being super duper involved in the situation. Like idk what the move is here, maybe you should just let it go and let her sit wherever he wants, but it does not seem like these people are handling anything appropriately and your wedding is getting caught in the crossfire. \n\nBasically I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for trying to fix it. But you might be making it all the more complicated for yourself.\n\nFWIW I didn\u2019t do a head table at my wedding and I absolutely hated dealing with it at the one wedding I went to with a head table. Might be your best solution to do a sweetheart table.", "So they\u2019re remarried but no one knows except your immediate family?", "YTA\n\nI cant quite understand why you wont seat them together", "YTA\n\nYour brother and Flora are still clearly very connected to each other.  This is who they want to be seated next to at the wedding.  There is literally NO reason for them not to be seated next to each other, except for the fact that you are worried that people will discuss them instead of you.  Which is straight up crazy Bridezilla behavior.\n\nAnd, as is so often the way with crazy Bridezilla behavior, totally senseless.  If you don't sit your brother next to Flora, he is going to get up from his seat and go hang out by her table all night.  People who saw him sitting next to her in his assigned seat would have thought nothing of it. \"Oh look, we heard they had an amicable divorce and are still friends.\"  People who see him hovering around her all night are going to have a field day with \"Did you see how Noah was all over Flora?  I bet he wants her back!\"", "Why would you not *ask Flora* if she would prefer to have her (ex)spouse sit next to her or not? You keep repeating that you\u2019ve told her the arrangements you\u2019ve made, but you just keep avoiding the question of what she would actually want. You don\u2019t have to guess; you can just ask her. (And, btw, a CNA is not a nurse. Since your brother is her regular caregiver, he probably is better qualified to look after her.)", "YTA, that\u2019s petty af", "Emotionless Mannequin after reading that statement LMAO.", "NTA. Your brother needs to figure out if he still loves her or not.", "NTA. You\u2019ve discussed it with Flora and she\u2019s happy with your arrangements. End of story. The rest is just fluff.

Then again, Flora doesn\u2019t ask for help so I doubt she would\u2019ve asked for accommodations", "Does flora know that? Have you taken to her about what would make her comfortable?", "They didn\u2019t say did you ask about her accommodations, they said did you ask about her FEELINGS. Does she want to be seated with your brother/her husband?", "The question wasn't, did you ask her about accommodations. \n\nThe question was, did you ask her if she would prefer if your brother sat with her? How she felt about it?\n\nHonestly you are going to draw attention by seating them separately. He will go over to see to her. To make sure she has what she needs, if he is seated next her this would be less obvious.", "Yes, I sent her a list of what\u2019s I\u2019ve prepared and asked if she needed anything. She just said thanks and she\u2019s excited for the wedding. But to be honest, Flora\u2019s not the one to ask for accommodations anyways which is why I had my mom make sure we covered everything. Noah tends to go overboard with taking care of Flora. For example, he cuts her food up into small pieces and he baby proofed the entire house so that there are no sharp edges if she passes out and he makes her take a bedtime and monitors her eating and sleeping patterns.", "It feels like OP is being a bit vague. I agree with above. Did you specifically ask her if she wanted to be seated with Noah?\n\nOtherwise you have presented her with a list of stuff you have done and out the onus on her to disagree with you. She may not feel comfortable since it's your wedding asking for something.\n\nYou also speak as though you know more about what's happening between Noah and Flora than anyone else. \n\nFor him to be stepping up so much it would mean that there is a lot happening that you are not privy too.\n\nAsk Flora if she wants Noah seated with her.", "YTA. Period. Full stop. Asshole. Hope they ask folks to switch places.  It will be hysterically more disruptive & people will think you were awful for not seating them together in the first place. It will be THE talk of the wedding!!  Hmm, how to avoid that?\u2026\u2026\u2026", "As long as flora is happy with the arrangements.", "Agreed, OP is being super vague, but latest edits says \u201cthey (Flora and husband) will be the talk of the party instead of my wedding\u201d so that shows her priorities. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s your day OP, but own your actions. YTA", "She\u2019s being vague because the facts don\u2019t support her position.", "I think if they want to sit together then you should sit them together. Sitting them apart will either result in them not coming , or may create more of a scene in the end. \n\nAlso there are always other minor gossipy chats at weddings. Someone has got pregnant. Someone has just got engaged. Etc etc etc. the whole day will still be \u2018about you\u2019 but you can\u2019t expect every single conversation all throughout the wedding to be about you and you alone. YTA", "You seem confused. You admit they're married but then continually claim they're divorced. So, my question is WTF is wrong with you?", "So when you say \"ex wife\" you mean, \"wife\", they are married after all.\n\nYTA.", "Ngl, you had me in the first half up until you said \u201cthey\u2019d be the topic of conversation rather than my wedding.\u201d\n\nWho cares if he sits next to her. They might not have remarried out of love, but clearly there is still some care & love there between them even if the marriage was for medical benefits. Otherwise, why would he be doing what he\u2019s doing? He easily could\u2019ve said \u201clet her figure it out.\u201d But no. He\u2019s doing his best to step up and be a pillar of support to this woman who needs it. \n\nIt\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve gone above and beyond to accommodate her at your wedding, but two things to note:\n\n1. It\u2019s your wedding day, let your brother take care of his \u201cwife.\u201d\n\n2. Does it really matter if they gossip? You seem more worried about the gossip surrounding them and losing the spotlight as opposed to just enjoying your own wedding. \n\nYTA.", ">I don\u2019t want gossip on why they\u2019re sitting together when they\u2019re divorced\n\nThis confuses me. Whether they only remarried just for Flora to be on your brother's health insurance or not, they are now legally married. If someone asks why your brother and his (not ex) wife are seated together, correct them and tell them they've remarried. Done.\n\nAlso, you're skirting questions asking if you've asked Flora if she wants to sit with your brother. YTA. Grow up and ask your (very legal) sister-in-law. Just because you think of her as \"a little stoic\" doesn't mean she doesn't any have feelings.", "Info: have you asked Flora if she wants to sit next to him? Her answer is what matters at this point.", "YTA\n\nThey ARE married and he'd want to be beside her 'just in case'.\n\nThere's no need for you to drive a wedge in between them unless you're acting out some anti-Flora resentment.", "YTA", "YTA\u2026. You and your mother can tell yourselves what you want Noah is in love with flora and regrets divorcing her now he\u2019s making up for it by being there for her every need you do not know what goes on behind closed doors they are probably keeping quiet because your family and friends are a bunch of old gossipy judgemental busybodies \nSit your brother with his wife and be done with it", "YTA   The title is misleading. \nIt's irrelevant they were married & divorced before, they're remarried now. \nObviously your an AH for not seating your brother next to wife. And an even bigger AH considering she has  specific needs that require her husbands support.\nYou don't get an award for hiring a stranger to aid her.\nYour taking advantage of the fact that Flora is quiet & won't voice her concerns. It's that same reason your brother is that much more vocal. \nHe has to be, otherwise people (like you) will run their own agenda & over top of her.\n\nWhether you realize it or not your drawing more attention to them. \nIt's not going to stay a secret they remarried, you'll probably manage to keep them separate during dinner at best but don't you worry.. \nThey'll be thisclose the remainder of the evening.\nAnd not only will people talk about them being remarried they'll also talk about your ridiculous seating chart to.", "What does flora want?", "Sounds like OP loves to gossip...", "I've wrote it so many times on here now. But.. no one gives a shit about your wedding as much as you do. Not even 1% as much as you do. \"it's ma speshul dai\", are you five?  \nIf you want people to enjoy it, give them what they want. How is that hard to understand.", "And you think it's only a paper marriage? Roflol he is clearly living with her and taking constant care of her.  That's some freaking amazing love there!"]}
