{"id": 13449, "submission_id": "125aopn", "title": "AITA for not seating my brother and his ex wife together at my wedding?", "selftext": "Throwaway. My (25F) wedding is in a month and I sent out the prospective seating chart to my bridal party which includes my bridesmaids and my immediate family. The bride and groom\u2019s parties are seated at the front at long tables for both the ceremony and reception. It makes things easier since there are a lot of moving parts. The rest of the guests are seated at small circular tables.\n\nMy brother Noah (28M) was upset that his ex wife Flora (31F) wasn\u2019t seated with him like the other spouses. \n\nThey got divorced two years ago after Noah said that Flora was an emotionless mannequin who had no time or energy for him. Our family was stunned because Flora always seemed loving though her calmness is sometimes a little too stoic. I think his friends are to blame. My mom loved Flora. About a year ago, Flora had a car accident where she passed out behind the wheel and drove into a tree in her backyard. It turns out she had a disease that affected her heart and her body. It was a miracle that she was even able to function as long as she did. She looked fine if a bit underweight but she was close to death.\n\nNoah and our mom threw themselves into helping Flora. He drives her everywhere, makes all her specialized meals, does the chores, makes the doctors appointments. He really stepped up. They recently got remarried so Flora can be on his health insurance rather than hers, although it\u2019s just a marriage on paper. My mom\u2019s still upset about that. \n\nI made sure that the venue was aware of Flora\u2019s needs, so she\u2019s seated close to an exit for fresh air, has the right dietary food, and a person there to help her if need be (edit: a CNA/nurse). \n Flora hasn\u2019t asked for anything. Noah, however, says that he needs to be seated next to her to take care of her needs. I\u2019ve already taken care of Flora\u2019s needs and I don\u2019t want gossip on why they\u2019re sitting together when they\u2019re divorced on my wedding day, so I told him no. He threw a fit and said neither of them would come to the wedding. My mother is begging me to reconsider but she wants them to get back together. AITA?\n\nEdit: most people, including our friends and extended family, don\u2019t know about Flora\u2019s health issues or that Noah\u2019s been taking care of her or that they are legally remarried. Our family and friends are a gossipy bunch and it will definitely be the talk of the party rather than my wedding. \n\nMy mom knows the ins and outs of Flora\u2019s illness and I talked with her on what Flora needed. She is invited as my mother\u2019s and my guest officially\n\n I sent her a list of what\u2019s I\u2019ve prepared and asked if she needed anything. She just said thanks and she\u2019s excited for the wedding. But to be honest, Flora\u2019s not the one to ask for accommodations anyways which is why I had my mom make sure we covered everything.\n\nEdit2: I admit I\u2019m the a hole and a bit of a bridezilla. I asked Flora if she wanted to sit next to my brother and she said she was fine with the RN (not CNA) and she didn\u2019t want her heart monitor to beep during the wedding. I assured her it was totally okay and after talking it over with her and the RN, we decided she would sit between my mom and my brother but closer to my mom as it made it clear she was invited by my mom. So the order would go my bridesmaids +spouse, my dad, mom, Flora, and Noah. Flora declined a +1 (though I offered) and Noah knows he\u2019s banned from any +1s. \n\nFlora doesn\u2019t want people to know about the remarriage and honestly I understand. Noah was a nightmare during the divorce. In the later part of their marriage, he would complain that she didn\u2019t love him enough because she didn\u2019t plan enough things on the weekend, she would fall asleep on date nights or at movies, she would take hours to make him a simple cake, she would always be tired, she forgot their first date anniverary, she forgot his favorite things, and she didn\u2019t shower him with enough attention. Noah is a needy person; he need his partner to know that he\u2019s the center of their world like they\u2019re the center of his. Flora was trying SO hard. She supported him through college, got him a better job, would lavish him with attention but the small things got him. She would write notes to herself to remember the things he cared about, she would spend hours making him desserts, she drank so much caffeine to keep herself awake for him. His best friend (who I suspect always had a crush on him) would tell him that she didn\u2019t care if she didn\u2019t do this or remember that or had enough energy and Noah listened.\n\nI told him that Flora was trying and he said trying wasn\u2019t good enough. He blindsided her with a divorce but even after they divorced he needed her emotional support and she helped him. \n\nThen after the accident we find out Flora\u2019s heart was failing and couldn\u2019t get blood to her brain. She literally was dying and still trying so hard.\n\nHe\u2019s acting like a good husband now but he\u2019s not Flora\u2019s husband and I respect that. She didn\u2019t want anyone to know about the remarriage. \n\nI know he never stopped loving her and was temporarily crazy but I didn\u2019t want my wedding to be a situation where everyone asks if they\u2019re back together and what Flora did to win him back and how my brother might let it slip that they\u2019re remarried. She doesn\u2019t like attention and I frankly think our friends and family will gossip about what she did to \u201cwin\u201d him back. Either way, I asked Flora and she confirmed she\u2019s good with the seating.", "created_utc": 1680057494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aopn/aita_for_not_seating_my_brother_and_his_ex_wife/", "score": 1716, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Moreover, you\u2019ve taken away my ability to be close to one of the few people in the WORLD, let alone at your wedding, who knows the severity of my illness and will know exactly what I need while also knowing that I want to be subtle about my health in public.

I'm not saying these things to scare you, I'm just saying there's more important things the bride/bridal party should be worried about before a situation like this, and tbh even if their marriage is for insurance purposes he's still the primary caretaker and should be the one to assist her, versus asking a sibling or friend to 1.

There was drama and guests needed to be swapped to different tables but so was busy taking pictures with my new husband and was so happy I didn\u2019t even notice or care what was happening. Talk to your brother and his wife. Tell them your concerns. Maybe they can let people know a little of what is happening- like back together all good now, before the wedding.

Noah sounds like he regrets leaving his wife.", "I don't know what you mean by that infirm, she was apparently next to death, passed out while driving and now has both her husband, the husband's mom and a nurse all as caregivers so she sounds pretty damn infirm to me.", "Babe chill out and take a breath. What do you not understand about being separated but still technically married for health benefits? And if the relationship is a secret then one of the parties obviously doesn\u2019t want to be in the relationship because it\u2019s not normal to hide a relationship that you want to be in? What is confusing about this to you. I\u2019ve said they are technically married. But saying Noah needs to be next to his wife is a stretch because it\u2019s one lunch/ dinner and op doesn\u2019t say Noah is floras care person. He just helps.", "They care for one another lol where? Noah clearly does care for flora but flora doesn\u2019t seem to be diving into the relationship as evidenced by the fact that it\u2019s a secret.", "Surely if flora wanted something she would ask", "Y\u2019all needa read the updates", "NTA ~~YTA~~ your edit swayed me.", "NTA. You could give them a listing of where they could sit. Explain why you sat her where you did and if he understands why and still wants her to sit next to him then by all means, let them sit together. Just so, if something happens to her, the onus would be on him.", "Is Flora the type of person who makes her wishes known? Maybe she's conflict-avoidant. But how awful to attend a wedding with your ex beside you. I'd be feeling all sorts of ways!", "I\u2019m gonna go off trend here and say NTA. While you definitely went way overboard it\u2019s very clear that you wanted your SIL to be safe and comfortable as well as respecting their privacy. It\u2019s definitely a little selfish to be more worried about the gossip but I don\u2019t think your intentions are ill-willed", "NTA - It sounds like you are trying to meet Flora's needs and wishes, and Flora does not want a lot of gossip.", "Wow, YTA. Are you really that insensitive? He is her CAREgiver, and I guarantee you she finds comfort in him being there with her. You say no one knows what's been going on or about her accident? She's probably feeling an insane amount of anxiety being around all these friends and family who last saw her before she was sick and will mostly ask how she is. He's the one person she's probably most comfortable with, and you won't let them sit together because people might care about her? Cold-hearted. I truly don't think you know how big of an AH you are for this. \n\nI empathize with how they feel because I have someone I love as my caregiver. We wouldn't attend our family members' wedding if they tried to do something like this. I know this is your wedding, but damn this is wildly selfish. My partner is sitting here like why?? Wtf are you on about?? Who gives a f people might ask what's up?? Are they only allowed to talk about you, specifically the entire day? This. Is. Crazy.", "YTA. Your friends are \u201ca gossipy bunch\u201d? To the point you can\u2019t even have this woman\u2019s care taker sit with her? Sounds like your friends are assholes too.", "Bruh just seat the people together if that\u2019s what they both want, wtf. YTA.", "YTA what the hell. How are your optics more important than keeping the person who takes care of someone next to the person they take care of? He wants to take care of her, and technically, they are husband and wife. A wedding is a long affair. If it's so boring that two people sitting next to one another is going to be all people can talk about then you need to work on your planning.", "YTA. Let your brother sit with his wife.", "My daughter & SIL had a big, fancy wedding. Except for walking her down the aisle, taking family pictures, my focus was on any problems (people came to me, not bridal couple) and the 9 other people @ my table that I had paid for (My daughter knew them, but not well. As they were \"my\" friends, who I wanted there, I felt it was right for me to pay for them!). The table my mother was at had her friends and favorite relatives. \nI watched the first dance, cake cutting, but the rest of the reception is a blur! We were having a great time at our table (though my escort refused to dance), lots of laughter, stories about work, teasing each other, drinking, etc.\nWho cares where her brother sits? If he's his wife's major caregiver, he should be sitting next to her. Though the bride has done everything she \"thinks\" her SIL may need, not through any fault of hers, something may be missing. Her brother is the only one who would know. \nI don't think the bridal party at my daughter & SIL's wedding were together, except for pictures. Even when dinner was served, most walked around between courses, greeting friends and family. One bridesmaid ate hardly anything, as always watching her weight. People are going to talk about the food if it's not good, the bridesmaids dresses if they're ugly or weird color, but fact groomsman sat next to wife, should hardly cause a ripple!\nYTA!", "YTA they are married. You dont get to dictate that its only on paper.  He is her caregiver and his wife.  If you dont put him with her YOU are the AH", "YTA. Your only reason is that they might steal some attention away from gossips. How petty.", "YTA your brother rekindled his relationship with his  ex and since no one really knows your trying to keep her in a corner.", "Marriage is stupid\u2026 how\u2019s that for feedback", "YTA No matter how many you edits you post. Your brother and his wife want to sit together. As they should. Flora is acting like she doesn't care bc she's a people pleaser and you're a Bridezilla.", "Agreed! What kind of person would refuse to sit the PRIMARY CAREGIVER next to his ailing (maybe) ex-wife? That's really heartless! And why - It will take attention away from you. It's your wedding! You're going to get plenty of attention.   \nYTA - OP", "YTA\n\nThey'd be divorced on his wedding day. They remarried....\n\nOk it's on paper. But he's her care giver as you say, he wants to be with her, they are married. \n\nI reckon there would be more talk of having a husband and wife sitting at opposite tables when everyone knows they were married previously and divorced and now married again, but sitting elsewhere.....", "She said flora didnt want people to know they remarried", "But they\u2019re married.", "> OP thinks that everyone will go home and talk about her brother rather than only discussing her dress and how lovely the table centerpieces were.\n\nSuch a common thing, people acting like attention at a wedding is a zero sum game. It's pathetic and childish.", "honestly you are so fucking rude. you are not a part of their relationship, so you have no room to speak on how they feel about each other. they are legally married and that\u2019s all that matters, anything else is their business.", "If they are seated separatly, the minute dinner is over and people start mingling, Noah is going to be at Flora's side and will be with her most of the time. They may even dance together!!! What will OP do then? Is she going to forbid her brother from talking to or being near Flora for the entire reception?", "Nah, no one thinks that much about the bride and groom except the bride and groom and maybe their parents. In general, no one at your wedding really cares that much about your wedding, or is ever going to think about it again when it\u2019s over, except you. That\u2019s why I always find it so crazy the money people spend and stress they endure so everyone can \u201ccelebrate them,\u201d when really we\u2019re all here to eat and drink and fulfill an obligation as a friend/family member", "I was MOH for my own mother's wedding and besides getting ready together and sitting at the head table, I spent more time thinking about everything being where it should be and on time than I did about my mom and step dad. It was also a big wedding with friends and family so we were all busy catching up with people we don't see often. \n\nIt soidified my plan on eloping and just having a big party. Less stress and \"big party\" is way cheaper than \"wedding reception\".", "You\u2019re not alone. I only think of bride and groom when they dance n speeches n stuff. Otherwise I talk to people at my table and eat", "Wow 25%? You've got me beat. The only time I'm thinking about the couple is when the couple is actively doing something that warrants my attention.", "I don't know what every person at my wedding was thinking/doing/talking about the entire time. I do know that I got attention and compliments the entire time. And I had someone at my wedding who is semi-famous. When you're the bride, you're the center of attention. \n\nNoah and Flora being back together is not going to take over the wedding. Sure, some people will comment/speculate on it but it's going to be one of many conversations that are not about the bride and groom.", "She did put an edit that says \u201cRN(not CNA)\u201d but still, i do think seating her and her brother next to eachother would have been fine and better", "The best wedding I\u2019ve been to had a dress code of \u201cwhatever makes you feel \u2728fabulous\u2728\u201d and oh boy did people take that to heart", "Pedantic, but a CNA is not a nurse.", "OP acting like a stranger nurse or CNA sitting with her sister in law is somehow better than having her regular caregiver next to her. As if it\u2019s some kind of luxury she\u2019s offering her brother\u2019s wife. It\u2019s super transparent that she didn\u2019t take anyone else\u2019s feelings into account and thinks this is a way she can get what she wants and make it seem like she\u2019s not the AH", "Yeah, especially in view of an entire wedding \ud83d\ude44\n\nUse your brain.", "We ordered decks of cards with colors that fit our day, and had a few checkerboards out at the hi-top tables at our reception. Was fun to see people playing.\n\nWe still have the decks of cards \n\nYTA OP", "My cousin had giant lawn games and then they drew names and gave them away at the end of the night. My son one the amazing cornhole game his husband hand made and everytime we play it we remember the wedding and think fondly of the couple (we live far away). Such a great idea \ud83d\udc95", "I love that!! That\u2019s basically what I told my bridesmaids. I was like, here\u2019s the color scheme - choose a floor length dress you feel good and comfy in!", "Are you okay?", "That's the thing, OP sounds bitter for some reason, clearly these 2 people care about eachother. You don't go out of the way like that for someone you don't care about. The \"on paper\" part seems to just be how she looks at it. I've known multiple couples who divorced and remarried, it's not a rare occurrence, maybe not common, but marriage is marriage.", "It\u2019s a Reddit post. It\u2019s become our business to opine lol"]}
