My (25F) wedding is in a month and I sent out the prospective seating chart to my bridal party which includes my bridesmaids and my immediate family. The bride and groom\u2019s parties are seated at the front at long tables for both the ceremony and reception. It makes things easier since there are a lot of moving parts. The rest of the guests are seated at small circular tables.\n\nMy brother Noah (28M) was upset that his ex wife Flora (31F) wasn\u2019t seated with him like the other spouses. \n\nThey got divorced two years ago after Noah said that Flora was an emotionless mannequin who had no time or energy for him. Our family was stunned because Flora always seemed loving though her calmness is sometimes a little too stoic. I think his friends are to blame. My mom loved Flora. About a year ago, Flora had a car accident where she passed out behind the wheel and drove into a tree in her backyard. It turns out she had a disease that affected her heart and her body. It was a miracle that she was even able to function as long as she did. She looked fine if a bit underweight but she was close to death.\n\nNoah and our mom threw themselves into helping Flora. He drives her everywhere, makes all her specialized meals, does the chores, makes the doctors appointments. He really stepped up. They recently got remarried so Flora can be on his health insurance rather than hers, although it\u2019s just a marriage on paper. My mom\u2019s still upset about that. \n\nI made sure that the venue was aware of Flora\u2019s needs, so she\u2019s seated close to an exit for fresh air, has the right dietary food, and a person there to help her if need be (edit: a CNA/nurse). \n Flora hasn\u2019t asked for anything. Noah, however, says that he needs to be seated next to her to take care of her needs. I\u2019ve already taken care of Flora\u2019s needs and I don\u2019t want gossip on why they\u2019re sitting together when they\u2019re divorced on my wedding day, so I told him no. He threw a fit and said neither of them would come to the wedding. My mother is begging me to reconsider but she wants them to get back together. AITA?\n\nEdit: most people, including our friends and extended family, don\u2019t know about Flora\u2019s health issues or that Noah\u2019s been taking care of her or that they are legally remarried. Our family and friends are a gossipy bunch and it will definitely be the talk of the party rather than my wedding. \n\nMy mom knows the ins and outs of Flora\u2019s illness and I talked with her on what Flora needed. She is invited as my mother\u2019s and my guest officially\n\n I sent her a list of what\u2019s I\u2019ve prepared and asked if she needed anything. She just said thanks and she\u2019s excited for the wedding. But to be honest, Flora\u2019s not the one to ask for accommodations anyways which is why I had my mom make sure we covered everything.", "created_utc": 1680057494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125aopn/aita_for_not_seating_my_brother_and_his_ex_wife/", "score": 827, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it sounds as if your brother is being a responsible caregiver and loving husband, making great sacrifices for her well-being.\n\nAnd now you're going to act as if none of this is true?  Refuse to acknowledge how your brother is, now, a model of the responsibility that a spouse promises \"in sickness or in health\"?\n\nCaregivers are not interchangeable.

Even if people do talk about them, you and your partner will still be the focus! You\u2019re getting married! Even if they\u2019re not assigned to sit together they may still end up sitting together as people mingle, they may dance, etc. It would be focus on your joy and work on letting this go than trying to keep them apart (which is probably not going to work) and preventing gossip (definitely not going to work).", "YTA even if their marriage is for convenience only, how is having ex-spouses being friendly at the same table gossip fodder.

Why haven\u2019t you seated me next to my legal husband, who is my primary caregiver and more attuned to my physical and emotional state than the random CNA that you hired in an attempt to look thoughtful without having to potentially sacrifice an ounce of attention during your sPeCiAl DaY? Moreover, you\u2019ve taken away my ability to be close to one of the few people in the WORLD, let alone at your wedding, who knows the severity of my illness and will know exactly what I need while also knowing that I want to be subtle about my health in public. You\u2019re a selfish prick and YTA.\u201d\n\nEDIT: Also\u2026 you do realize that guests are allowed to get out of their seats, right? Lmao. Like, there\u2019s a very good chance that Noah and Flora are going to end up spending most of the reception together after dinner based on how you\u2019ve described their current relationship. Two exes talking?! Oh my! Your friends/family/guests are STILL going to gossip no matter where you seat them so you might as well let them be comfortable.", "YTA. You sound exhausting and controlling. It would be one thing if they\u2019d asked to sit separately, but if they actually want to sit together, that should be enough. If I were your brother, I probably wouldn\u2019t go either.", " NTA per your edits\n\nSeems like dramalama going on with them keeping their remarriage a secret and your mom being super duper involved in the situation. Like idk what the move is here, maybe you should just let it go and let her sit wherever he wants, but it does not seem like these people are handling anything appropriately and your wedding is getting caught in the crossfire. \n\nBasically I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for trying to fix it. But you might be making it all the more complicated for yourself.\n\nFWIW I didn\u2019t do a head table at my wedding and I absolutely hated dealing with it at the one wedding I went to with a head table. Might be your best solution to do a sweetheart table.", "So they\u2019re remarried but no one knows except your immediate family?", "YTA\n\nI cant quite understand why you wont seat them together", "YTA\n\nYour brother and Flora are still clearly very connected to each other.  This is who they want to be seated next to at the wedding.  There is literally NO reason for them not to be seated next to each other, except for the fact that you are worried that people will discuss them instead of you.  Which is straight up crazy Bridezilla behavior.\n\nAnd, as is so often the way with crazy Bridezilla behavior, totally senseless.  If you don't sit your brother next to Flora, he is going to get up from his seat and go hang out by her table all night.  People who saw him sitting next to her in his assigned seat would have thought nothing of it. \"Oh look, we heard they had an amicable divorce and are still friends.\"  People who see him hovering around her all night are going to have a field day with \"Did you see how Noah was all over Flora?  I bet he wants her back!\"", "Why would you not *ask Flora* if she would prefer to have her (ex)spouse sit next to her or not?

You don\u2019t have to guess; you can just ask her. (And, btw, a CNA is not a nurse. Since your brother is her regular caregiver, he probably is better qualified to look after her.)", "YTA, that\u2019s petty af", "Emotionless Mannequin after reading that statement LMAO.", "NTA.

On the one hand they are remarried and OPs brother cares for her and takes care of her needs. On the other hand OPs concerns are valid. If the guests, who\u2019ve known OP\u2019s brother and wife and their divorce, see them together for the first time at OP\u2019s wedding they\u2019re gonna talk about them. I think OPs brother should make it public that he and his wife are married again and then they can sit together at the wedding. He shouldn\u2019t have a problem with that because he doesn\u2019t care about what anybody else thinks, but OP does. There\u2019s no need to mention the disease. That\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.", "I was thinking the same thing. Does Flora want to sit next to him?", "It's so weird when brides think nothing interesting should ever be the topic of conversation at their wedding. Does OP think literally every conversation at the wedding should be exclusively about the event? \n\nThis isn't like a wedding proposal or a pregnancy announcement; it would be a perfectly normal seating arrangement with a husband sitting with his wife, or a caregiver sitting with the person they aide. If the wife (PSA, OP: a woman who is re-married isn't an ex-wife anymore) is disabled enough that she requires that degree of care, it's not going to shock anyone to see her husband seated beside her.\n\nYTA and hella ableist on top of it.", "He's also her husband - in the edit OP says they got remarried.  I'm at a literal loss as to why OP separated them in the first place.", "and his wife!", "This exactly. OP must be dying to cause a stir and make the wedding about Noah and Flora. You know everyone is going to be asking why a married couple isn't sitting together. And it's pretty obvious OP just doesn't respect their marriage. OP is likely down playing how devoted and attached they are because elsewhere OP does mention a whole bunch of things Noah does for Flora and that Noah and Flora live together. Reminds me of the meme's about two men in past decades that lived together in a little out in the woods cabin who liked to go to art museums, and plays and dinner together. Joke is on OP", "What do you mean by \"strangely good with older ladies\"? Maybe people just like her because she's a nice person unlike someone who wants to make sure her wedding day in only about herself.", "But they are spouses\u2026 YTA", "I am wondering how she knows for certain it\u2019s a \u201cpaper only\u201d marriage. Her brother clearly cares about this woman more than he cares about the potential gossip. Unless there are other circumstances that you are not mentioning YTA. Just let him sit next to his wife.", "Maybe I\u2019m just a terrible wedding guest, but every wedding I\u2019ve attended I\u2019ve spent maaaaaybe 25% of the time thinking about the bride and groom. If I am spending hours and hours solely thinking about the couple getting married and watching their every move, that\u2019s either a wildly boring and bland wedding OR a wedding between 2 people that are such colossal trainwrecks on their own that I\u2019m convinced their wedding is a harbinger of the apocalypse.", "Well damn. Then I'm going to use mine up to agree with YTA. \n\nNot to mention that they are married!?! Weird how spouses and caregivers want to be near each other./s", "Yeah the brother has clearly turned out so well..what happened to OP?! Total opposites", "If anything, their marriage is an exemplary one. \"In sickness and in health\", and he remarried her to take care of her and provide for her. That is so romantic, even if there aren't any romantic feelings involved (slamming X for doubt on that, since OP sounds heartless enough to not recognize an intersection of love and duty).", "Wait, they've remarried? You've gone from \"obnoxiously self-centered\" to \"irredeemable asshole\". YTA.", "So that's your excuse for breaking up a husband and wife and not calling them husband and wife? YTA", "Ok buckle up buttercup. I am a medical professional. I have had many coworkers in the home health area or private sector who have no medical experience and they are some of the best most caring people ever. And a lot were family or friends of the person. So 0 medical experience has nothing to do with it. You are looking at a clinical POV not an emotional there are emotional ties there that you can\u2019t get from Joe Schmoe or Sad Sally. I was a caregiver of my dying Mom for two years. She took her last breath holding me hand. I will forever be greatful I got to be her main caregiver the last few years of her life despite other caregivers coming in and out. You are in no way shape or form to dictate or decide/judge their relationship or what you feel is appropriate or not.", "Sit her with her husband. And stop calling him her ex when they are legally married. YTA", "No, it is not! Wedding ceremony is for you, but the wedding is for everybody.", "So obviously nobody should DARE speak about anything other than you and you alone\u2026 I hope you manage to check your expectations before the wedding day or you\u2019re in for a rough realization", "You've made it abundantly clear you only care about yourself and \"your\" wedding. The reception is for your guests, to celebrate with loved ones. Not an ego trip that demands all eyes on you at all time! \n\nYour brother made a reasonable request as his wife's primary caregiver, but your concern is only how it will look? You sound ableist and self-centered. YTA!", "It\u2019s your and your fianc\u00e9s wedding there are two of you no?", "And? You're really THIS upset that someone at your wedding might not be paying attention to you for a few minutes??!! Fucking pathetic.", "Yeah maybe I was just a terrible bride because I still had fun at my wedding even though there were lots of children, a visibly pregnant bridesmaid, a bridesmaid with hairy armpits, no seating chart, and lots of lawn games that took the guests\u2019 attention away from me.", "OMG, the staring in the general direction of the bridal couple while you imagine who would win in a battle between Dr Strange and Q (from Star Trek). Best part of every wedding.", "I always think brides like this have never attended a wedding as a guest and only have ever watched fantasy (reality show) weddings\n\nOP, YTA", "Didn\u2019t go to a lot of weddings but I remember the things I thought about the most was food and when the hell it would be coming because seriously I hate waiting so long between plates.   \nthe only wedding it didn\u2019t happen had a French/Vietnamese buffet and that was awesome.", "Well after seeing a nurse sit next to her the whole wedding I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll soon figure it out", "Not a nurse \"a CNA/nurse\". CNAs serve a very important purpose in healthcare, but they're not nurses. They *assist* nurses, hence the name \"certified nursing assistant\". OP thinks they're interchangeable with actual nurses, but somehow it's her brother whose medical knowledge is absurdly insufficient to make decisions regarding care on OP's wedding day. Ableism is not the chic look making the cover of bridal magazines. I wonder if she's switching her clown nose to a white one to better match her wedding gown.", "I hate to say it, but that explanation makes the most sense.", "Hell, I would take my gift cause a scene and bounce.", "A CNA is not a nurse. They can\u2019t do immediate care for her they\u2019re not trained for that nor is it in their scope.", "You can't imagine how many couples are only married on paper. You just don't know it \ud83d\ude09", "You nor OP get to dictate that though. That\u2019s between Flor and brother.", "we did lawn games at my wedding since neither of us are big fans of dancing.\n\nUltimate wedding ingredient for sure.", "Seriously. If I was a guest at the wedding and wasn't fully in-the-loop on the couple being remarried, I'd think it was sweet he was caring for his ex-wife and it wouldn't be something I thought to discuss. If I saw them sitting apart and heard they were remarried, then I actually *would* talk to other guests to ask \"Ayo, am I crazy or is he seated away from his wife with a stranger taking care of her instead? That's weird, right?\"\n\nIf OP wants to avoid the couple being a topic of conversation because \"it's my wedding\" (and it'll be your divorce when your husband gets tired of your attitude lmao) she's going about it the exact opposite of the right way.", "Bouncing with or without said gift in hand?", "I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a fully Craigslist verified nurse. :)", "I just typed a comment which was almost the same as yours except with lousier grammar. \n\nThis is absolutely correct.", "So no, you didn't ask her about how she feels. You told her what the plan was, and simply expected her to go along with it no matter what because it's your wedding. Did you even ask her if she wants her husband's next to her? Just because there's going to be a nurse there, doesn't mean she wouldn't also want her husband, someone who knows her personally to be there for support. He might not have medical training, but he can damn well be an emotional support person for her. You haven't even considered that possibility, because you're so focused on yourself. News flash, when accommodating somebody's disability, it no longer becomes about you. So at this point, arranging the seating for your brother and his wife, yes his wife not ex-wife, is not about you or your wedding. Making sure that they are seated in a good spot for her disability, is about her and accommodating her needs. Some of those needs might include having her husband near her regardless of whether there's a nurse there or not.\n\nBut you wouldn't know this, because you've been too self-centered to actually ask her how she feels instead of just telling her what's going to happen. Sounds like you have some issues that you need to unpack. I suggest therapy, not a wedding.", "When people find out that they've remarried, don't you think the talk will be about why your brother was the only family member at the head table without his spouse? Oh my gosh, what will people say then about you? You know they're going to be talking about how you secretly hate her and/or were embarrassed to have a disabled woman at your table. If your family is already gossipy, I highly doubt people aren't already aware they have remarried and are living together...", "Oh I see now. You are jealous of her. You are worried that GASP someone might get more attention than you on your wedding day. You need to grow up. Your brother is not going overboard. He is being a good husband and taking care of her. You have no right to invalidate their relationship. It sounds like he very much cares for her and you have some sort of problem with that.", "I'm very much getting this. OP sounds ableist AF and doesn't want Flora and her disability associated with the family any more than necessary!", "Ikr People do not go above and beyond like that because they just have a paper marriage very strange outlook by OP.", "The issue is that she doesn\u2019t want a disabled person at the head table. OP YTA, and a gigantic one at that. It\u2019s so transparent why you don\u2019t want to seat her at the head table with her husband and caretaker", "Yeah, IMO there\u2019s not enough INFO here to rule. There has been zero mention of what Flora wants in the OP.", "Wait, brother's sitting on the head table and Flora is sitting further back? I thought they were both seated at the main table(s), just not next to each other (sorry, I'm not familiar with this custom, as we don't have that at weddings in my country).\n\nIf that's her real reason, she not just self-centered but ableist as well."]}
