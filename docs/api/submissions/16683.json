As a neighborhood we have been having a lot of trouble with people choosing to not pick up their dogs poop. Today I was playing outside with my young daughter and she found a bright green bag and picked it up. It wasn\u2019t till I got closer that I realized that she was squeezing a poop bag. I was mad and annoyed that one of my neighbors would be that disrespectful to bag up their dog poop and leave it out. I went to my security camera to see who created the problem. I was able to get a shot of the person and the dog. Upon seeing the person I realized it matched the same description from another neighbor that posted that morning about the same incident happening in front of their house. I chose to post the photo of the kid to our private HOA group since the previous post with only a description did not gain any traction. \nLater that evening I was greeted by my direct neighbor who I have been great with. He informed me that he was friends. With the kids parents and he thought I was out of line posting a photo of a minor. He asked me how I\u2019d feel if someone posted that same photo of one of my children when they were bigger. I told him I\u2019d walk my child to that house have them knock on the door and apologize. My neighbor was adamant that I crossed a line by posting a photo of a minor. While I may not understand the neighbors frustration I did offer to take the photo down and ask that he talk to the family as I have no clue who or where the kid lives in the neighborhood. \n\nAITA for posting the photo of the kid leaving dog shit in my yard? \n\nOther points of consideration I\u2019m the type of guy who would normally have a face to face conversation, But I don\u2019t know where the kid lives or who his parents were. This happened at least twice this weekend as another neighbor posted a similar incident. I chose a screen grab that was not clear enough to make out the kid\u2019s face rather showed their outfit and and another distinctive item. \n\nIf you do think I am the asshole what suggestion do you have that I could have dealt with this and got this to stop happening?", "created_utc": 1683530213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bh6zb/aita_for_posting_a_photo_of_a_minor_to_a_private/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
