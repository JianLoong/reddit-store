As a neighborhood we have been having a lot of trouble with people choosing to not pick up their dogs poop. Today I was playing outside with my young daughter and she found a bright green bag and picked it up. It wasn\u2019t till I got closer that I realized that she was squeezing a poop bag. I was mad and annoyed that one of my neighbors would be that disrespectful to bag up their dog poop and leave it out. I went to my security camera to see who created the problem. I was able to get a shot of the person and the dog. Upon seeing the person I realized it matched the same description from another neighbor that posted that morning about the same incident happening in front of their house. I chose to post the photo of the kid to our private HOA group since the previous post with only a description did not gain any traction. \nLater that evening I was greeted by my direct neighbor who I have been great with. He informed me that he was friends. With the kids parents and he thought I was out of line posting a photo of a minor. He asked me how I\u2019d feel if someone posted that same photo of one of my children when they were bigger. I told him I\u2019d walk my child to that house have them knock on the door and apologize. My neighbor was adamant that I crossed a line by posting a photo of a minor. While I may not understand the neighbors frustration I did offer to take the photo down and ask that he talk to the family as I have no clue who or where the kid lives in the neighborhood. \n\nAITA for posting the photo of the kid leaving dog shit in my yard? \n\nOther points of consideration I\u2019m the type of guy who would normally have a face to face conversation, But I don\u2019t know where the kid lives or who his parents were. This happened at least twice this weekend as another neighbor posted a similar incident. I chose a screen grab that was not clear enough to make out the kid\u2019s face rather showed their outfit and and another distinctive item. \n\nIf you do think I am the asshole what suggestion do you have that I could have dealt with this and got this to stop happening?", "created_utc": 1683530213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bh6zb/aita_for_posting_a_photo_of_a_minor_to_a_private/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your neighbor sounds off. It's not like you were posting nude photos. The kid deserves to be named and shamed for not cleaning up after the dog when they walk it.", "NTA. id do the same thing lmao. kid deserves to be put on blast. that\u2019s a super rude and disrespectful thing to do.", "NTA. They should be upset their child is leaving bags of dog poop in people's yards instead of making the pic of a minor seem creepy. Like it's a normal ass picture and security footage so why is it considered weird? That guy who confronted you isn't all that friendly with you and honestly, I think you should leave the photo up and catch everyone who leaves dog shit on your lawn in the same way.", "NTA... You posted a photo of someone in the act of a crime, it doesn't matter what age he/she is.", "NTA\n\nIf it were a one off incident I probably would've just said in the HOA group that your security camera has caught an image of who the kid was so if any parents want to see the pic to see if it's their kid then you're happy to share.\n\nHowever, this is a repeated issue that's been raised before and the parents have clearly done nothing to educate their kidd so posting a pic caught by your security camera (not you whipping out your phone and recording them) is reasonable.", "Keep up the post and edit it telling them to come and own up to it themselves without making their friend go on their behalf like cowards", "NTA.  the pic wasn't to spy on a kid it was to reveal the identity of a culprit.  not your fault the culprit was a minor.  maybe the parents will be shamed into raising the kid better now..", "NTA. just because it\u2019s a child, doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for their actions", "NTA. You don't know the parents.  You don't know the kid. They were lazy enough to leave poop behind, but some of these folks expect you to start a door to door campaign to find them. \n\nYou did the right thing. Post the pic, and when you find the kid, take it down. This post does not seem like it was intended to humiliate the kid. It was made to find out who it was so a conversation could be had. It seems to have worked. \n\nSave the picture. If you collect three or four of them and the parents don't correct the behavior, take the pics to the police.", "NTA....\nThey are out in a public setting and have no right of privacy. You can publish any photo taken in a pbllic setting.", "Disregarding whether you're *legally* in the right or not; you're now the New Neighbour that escalates to passive-aggressive public shaming at the very first issue *you* had, instead of just speaking to the parents in question. \n\nI'd be more concerned with making sure you don't keep that reputation than whether or nor posting a kid's photo is illegal, because regardless of your side of the story people are sure going to think YTA with that first impression.", "NTA, your neighbor is being silly.  There's nothing wrong with posting that photo.", "NTA - I put myself in the kid's parents shoes. I wouldn't care that much for a picture of my kid on a WhatsApp group, because the kid's behavior is unacceptable. I would like to know it to have a serious talk with my kid. Sure I'd rather if the person could find me without using the picture. But my main concern would be my kid and how to correct such a selfish attitude.", "Nta someone is disrespectful of your property and has no right to be using it that way.  The parents are embarrassed that their kids got caught is what it boils down to.  They feel entitled to do a they please.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re a new neighbor who, at the very first offense, posted a photo of a child you do not know to FB to complain instead of just making a post asking parents to talk to their kids about not leaving dog bags. It would have been so easy to not post that picture and yet you did.\n\nMy parents live in a new build HOA development and I lived there with them for a time before moving out a few years ago. I\u2019m still in the community FB group and can tell you with 100% certainty that people in your neighborhood think you\u2019re TA. \n\nThere have been so many times where kids have done stuff in my parents neighborhood that got posted to the FB group and everyone just comments on the post and shares their own story/agrees. It\u2019s fine, kids do stupid stuff sometimes and it\u2019s no big deal but everyone still talks about the guy who posted pictures from his ring camera when he complained about something. I don\u2019t even remember what he was complaining about, and neither do my parents. But everyone knows him as the guy who was so bent out of shape over something so small that he went in and posted pictures of other peoples kids. \n\nNo one cares when the complaints are just a written post, but everyone thinks the guy who posts pictures of other people\u2019s kids is an asshole. And now you\u2019re that guy, congrats.", "yta - even if the kid did something wrong you don't need to humiliate it in front of 150 others. Will you take responsibility if the kid get bullied over this by others?\n\nAnd as you clearly proof in your post, if you just had shared it with a few friends you would already have found out who it was.", "YTA  \nThere was no need to post a photo of a minor online. Further, you literally would have found out who he was just by asking the neighbor you are \"great with\" where the kid lived. Then you could have spoken to the parents and found out if it was the kid being intentionally annoying or just being unintentionally obtuse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They deserve to be humiliated if they can't be a decent human being.", "I agree surly there were other ways to settle this?

You did nothing wrong and you've broken no laws as far as I can find online - it's a private group; it's not like you posted this on Twitter where anyone can see it.  \n\nYour neighbor acted on his own misgivings, not on behalf of the parents nor the kid.

If adults are bullying kids over shirking their responsibilities, that speaks more to adults being assholes and less to OP being tired of the kid using their lawn as a dumpster for dog poop bags."]}
