I'll just explain it and see what you guys think.\n\nThis past Saturday, I was hanging out with a couple of friends at a house party. Nice evening, good dinner and just casual conversations. At one point, the topic became marriage (we're at that age), and people were talking about a lot of stuff. I have absolutely no knowledge of this stuff. I'm not in a relationship or any close to entering one. So, I just listened.\n\nThat's when Anna (not her name), decided to talk about wedding rings. She's not in a relationship as well, so this was just her opinion on things. She claimed that, when someone proposes to her, she expected the wedding ring to be worth something in the average of 50\u201360 thousands. \n\nShe was right beside me as she spoke, and honestly, I really was caught off guard. I unintentionally said, \"That's a high standard.\" which it is, but maybe I should have kept my mouth shut. She proceeded to ask me, and I quote, \"What the hell do you mean by that?\"\n\nI didn't mean anything more than that. It is a high standard, and she's allowed to have it. So, I explained that a that price range for a ring is an extremely high standard. Most people of our age group make that or less than that yearly. Even someone who makes more than six-figures wouldn't have an easy time buying such an expensive ring. However, I didn't say she couldn't have those standards. It's her life, not mine!\n\nHowever, it seemed she didn't interpret that way and has been bad-mouthing me to our friends. A mutual friend told me she's been claiming I'm a misogynistic asshole for thinking I can comment on her dream.\n\nI understand I screwed up and shouldn't have said anything to start. However, I don't think I'm an asshole just because of a damned comment. I mean, if I really am such an asshole, I'll definitely apologize to her.

I've been wearing a ring that I paid probably $20 for and have had for 15 years (purchased before I knew my husband) because it matches the ring I purchased for him.

If you love someone, spend your lives together making the world more beautiful!!!", "I specifically asked for an amethyst! I love my ring.", "NTA. Any woman that gives importance to the price of a wedding ring should never get married because this always means she's a gold digger. \n\nA ring is supposed to have a meaning, the meaning that person X wants to be with person Y permanently, legally and spiritually, so the price shouldn't matter. AT ALL", "Lmao NTA. I don\u2019t think she has an idea of what rings actually cost hahaha. For most people, dropping $10k on an engagement ring is *huge*. $50-$60k is just insane.", "NTA.
