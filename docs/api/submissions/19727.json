No matter how bad of an idea it is for her to have another kid, it\u2019s her body and her choice.  If I were you I\u2019d instead discuss with her how she\u2019s been deficient and negligent as a parent, and encourage her to look in to putting the baby up for adoption.\n\nGo and live with your father.  Do it as soon as possible, otherwise one day you\u2019ll come home from school and find out that your dogs have disappeared.  You want to move with them before that happens.", "NTA at all.  Oh Honey, I\u2019m so sorry for your situation.  It\u2019s not fair for you to have to deal with all of this at such a young age.\n\nThat said, you can\u2019t decide for someone else to have an abortion.  No matter how bad of an idea it is for her to have another kid, it\u2019s her body and her choice.

You want to move with them before that happens.", "Go live with your dad and bring your dogs with you. If you stay, you'll become the constant unpaid babysitter. NTA", "And bring the dog.", "This 1000/1000", "Take a moment to reflect on that first sentence and why you thought that was an acceptable way to talk to a kid.", "You and your mother live in a one-bedroom apartment that she can barely afford and want to bring home a baby.", "Why do you care what happens to your abusive, neglectful mother? It's not your responsibility. Besides you are NOT obligated to give a single fuck about ANYONE just because they are \"family\"", "I\u2019m a mental health nurse, and I believe that you\u2019re being very neglected. Your mom is not a stable parent. Please do be honest with your therapist and also consider living with your dad. Your mother is giving you way more responsibilities than is appropriate for your age.", "You are so correct that she is going to pass the baby to you. Is your dad reliable? Or will he parentify you as well?", "It's really sad when a 13 year old is so much more responsible than their parent.\n\nI got put into foster care at 12. I would not wish that on anyone.\n\nIf poster has family? She needs to go to them. She's old enough to choose non custodial parent and courts will uphold her choice.", "She has a dad she doesn't like much. But that sounds better than a mom who is neglectful and who makes terrible decisions.", "You should 100% go move with your dad. \n\nNTA", "The decision to abort is deeply personal and however you feel or think you are not the person that makes that decision.\nLiving will be cramped and more chores would fall on you. If you can go live with your father or grandparents until your mom adapts, that\u2019s a reasonable alternative (and gets you out from the babysitting/house chores)\nIt\u2019s possible she\u2019ll realize what she is getting into later on ( child care, expenses, lack of support from boyfriend etc).\nIt\u2019s tough because it\u2019s not your body, not your decision but you will be affected by the repercussions. You can try to minimize upheaval in your life, but you cannot dictate what your mother does with hers.\nBest of luck.", "NTA. You are clearly more mature and responsible than your mom at age 13. It sounds like you are already parenting your mother --you don't want to end up parenting a baby sibling as well.  If you think the situation would be better with your dad, you should go live there ASAP. Continue to work hard at school, make that your main focus, so that you can gain financial independence by the time you're 18. Being self-sufficient and financially independent by the time you become a legal adult will be the best decision you have ever made.", "NTA, you poor thing, I'm crushed to hear how your mom treats you. I hope you know that you deserve better. But you seem really smart and you see what's coming, so ya it would be best if you moved out ASAP. She'll likely beg for you to come back and help after awhile, but stay firm b/c you already know how she'll treat you once baby is here.   \nGood luck kiddo!", "NTA\nEven if you don't like your dad, I'd go with him. Your mother isn't ready for a baby when she won't take care of the child she already has.", "NTA and time to exit.  Call your father (or grandmother) and ask if you and your dogs can move in NOW.  You need to get out of your current situation.", "NTA , go live full time with you dad NOW", "NTA. I think you need to take your dogs and move. You're 13 so your options are pretty limited but you said you could move in with your dad. Or maybe some other family would take you in.\n\n\nIf I were you, I sure as hell wouldn't stick around to be the caretaker of your mom's new baby.", "You are 13. Save yourself a world of trauma and tell your therapist. I know its not an easy thing to do, but stop worrying about hurting your mom, because she obviously doesn't care if she hurts you. Parents have an obligation to care for and protect their children, you didn't ask to be born, she chose to have you. Clearly she is failing in that regard. \n\nSeriously. Tell your therapist. Do it. And NTA.", "Go to your dad's. Hopefully you can keep your dog.", "Move out your mom will most likely use you for a babysitter.", "Nta\n\nTake the dogs and go live with your dad", "NTA\n\nProtect yourself and your dog as much as you can so long as it's legal.\n\nIf living with dad is what it takes, so be it. Let mom handle her life decisions.", "Absolutely NTA. You deserve a loving home with loving family. I think it\u2019s best for you to move out of your mom\u2019s house and go with your dad, grandmother or any other family member you deeply trust and will 100% take you in with open arms and love. Make sure to take your dogs as well. Also, keep your little sibling in your prayers!", "NTA, I feel for you kid.  It is a shame that YOU have to be the voice of mature wisdom for your mother.", "Nothing will happen to your mom what is not 100% your mom's fault.\n\nYou want to suffer innocently so your mother doesn't have to pay for her wrongdeeds?", "Don't worry about your mom. She's supposed to be the adult. Tell them.", "If dad is safe? I agree. Part of me wonders if mom is poisoning her thoughts on dad?"]}
