I suggest you go live with your father or grandmother, because once that baby comes the neglect will probably multiply. You\u2019re not supposed to be responsible for everything around the house and I don\u2019t think your mother will start taking any responsibility. You moving away will allow you to focus on yourself, and not you taking on her duties.", "Your mother is a hot ass mess and needs people who love her enough to be honest with her.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s important that your mom and her boyfriend take financial responsibility for having babies instead of relying on your uncle.

It's her decision what she does thereafter.\n\nYou're not an asshole for being concerned and not wanting her to have a baby, considering she has been a bad mother to you. You're not even an asshole for voicing your concern to your mother. But I'd say you're slightly an asshole if you keep pushing for an abortion, it's not your decision.\n\nThe not knowing her partner long is irrelevant. People don't need to be in a long term relationship or even any relationship to have a baby. Co-parenting can still happen between parents not together.\n\nI do think your mum is wrong to be selling your dogs and moving you about to accommodate the new baby. But as I said, she's already pregnant and you do what you have to in that situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Literally. \n\nYou are not responsible for your mother\u2019s decisions. You are also not responsible for her well-being. You\u2019re 13! You should be in an environment where YOU are being cared for BY YOUR PARENT, not the other way around. Is it right for you to tell your mom to have an abortion? No. But your reasoning - at least from what I read - is because the child /she already has/ is being neglected. You. And you deserve to feel loved, valued, and cared for by your parent. \n\nYou are a child. I\u2019m not saying that to diminish your points, but to remind everyone that YOU ARE A CHILD.  \n\nShe has a responsibility to care for you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this \u2014 if nothing else, as someone who was in a very similar situation, know that it will get better. \n\nHang in there.

They will be able to help you and your dogs find better accommodations, whether that\u2019s with your father, grandmother, or someone else.  Therapists are trained to help children and teenagers in situations like these.  \n\nI\u2019m really sorry this is happening to you.  You might find some community and advice in r/raisedbynarcissists.  I lurk on that sub, and your story sounds like you would fit right in.  Maybe talking with people who have been through similar situations would help.  \n\nI send you a lot of virtual hugs.  NTA", "So you screwed over another person? If you had told then maybe authorities would have intervened and there\u2019d not be a baby", "It does make sense in a way, but only if you were like 10 years younger than you are.

You're blaming a CHILD for not wanting her own mother to get in trouble...", "so you're counting on the bf doing a full 180 in his behaviour. Sure, that'll work well. I get that it's a hard decision but in this case it's just very irresponsible... OP talking about her wanting her mom to get an abortion implies that the mom is already pregnant... After 2 months... this can't be a great start", "I'm not sure why OP doesn't like him I mean he's only known him 2 most but I agree with you it doesn't sound ideal.", "The only place I would ever hang out at my ex girlfriends house would be the room she rented, and her  kid would be in him room sleeping most the time. Besides, it bugged me that he didn't do what his mon asked of him we got along fine .he was always cool with me,sometimes it would be weird we didn't hang to much together at the house because is was a small room.I  asked him if he wanted to go camping or to ocean with us and he never did. I figured he wanted to be with friends", "There must be more to it", "NTA. OP, you are 13. You are not responsible for your mom or her decisions. It\u2019s her responsibility to parent you, not the other way around. If you have the ability to move in with your dad, do it before she makes the baby your responsibility too. You deserve a loving childhood and to keep your dogs. You mentioned a therapist elsewhere in the comments. If you feel safe, tell your therapist what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re supposed to be a trusted adult in your life. I understand being anxious about what might happen to your mom, but you clearly need help. Don\u2019t let your mom make you feel guilty about anything. She\u2019s in the wrong here. This is not your burden to carry.\n\nLastly, I need to correct something you said. This isn\u2019t jealousy. Jealousy is when you want something that someone else has and that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. This is actually resentment towards your mom, which means you\u2019re upset because of the way you\u2019re being unfairly treated. And that feeling of resentment is completely justified here.

Your Mum isn\u2019t taking care of the child she has had for 13 years, as it is. She has to move in with a family member and get rid of your dogs, to make ends meet.

Sorry, I know how cynical that sounds. But the mom is selfish and doesn't seem to have OP best interest in her decision making.", "The comment about paragraphs to a 13-year old in this situation is snarky and unkind.  She's demonstrated so many positive qualities in this post. So unnecessary.", "If the mom truly loved OP, then she wouldn't have constantly neglected her and made her do housework for years. She wouldn't have suggested selling OP's pets and moving just for financial support.\n\nHow does any of this sound like love to you?", "Whatever happens to your mom is a consequence of her own choices. You can't make choices for her (else she wouldn't be having a baby) and you can't protect her from her own choices. At the very most you'll enable her to continue making bad ones, with you making the sacrifices, like she just expects your uncle to let her move in and support her financially.\n\nIt's hard to be raised to support family and then not do it but some people need less support so they don't spend their whole life demanding support because they make stupid decisions.
