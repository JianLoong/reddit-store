I told her shes still in the honeymoon phase and she tells me shes known him for a year but i tell her dating someone and being friends with one is completely different. My grandma is usually very excited about grandchildren but even she knows that this is an extremely bad idea. My whole family thinks that shes being stupid and we are ALL trying to convince her to have an abortion. My mom and I live in a one bedroom apartment and she wants to sell my dogs so \u201cwe don\u2019t have other things to worry about.\u201d She also wants to move in a house with my uncle so he could \u201chelp us out financially\u201d or whatever. I told her that if she has to give up on MY dogs and move in with my uncle then that should tell her enough that she shouldn\u2019t be having a baby. Her boyfriend is also very immature and does nothing to help around in the house. She has barely been around for me emotionally and physically, her own ex boyfriend told me he felt bad for me because how much she had neglected me when they were together. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do or say. I told her if she has that baby I\u2019ll go live with my dad. I dont like him that much either but honestly anything would be better than staying with someone who makes me feel nothing but anger all the time. All the time i tell her ill go with my dad she just says \u201cgood, good, you should go so i don\u2019t have to deal with you not supporting my decision\u201d I hate how she acts like she can live without me when i know damn well she cant because im the only one who does most of the work in the house and i know once she has that baby she will throw it off to me and make me take care of it. I can be honest this is also rooted in some jealousy because shes never been a very supportive mom and ive already been having a lot of mental issues mainly all because of her and this is just making it all worse. I want her to get rid of that baby so bad, and somehow. I know im young and i might be overreacting but I genuinely cannot do this shes already a pain to live with but this is honestly just the \u201ccherry on top\u201d or whatever. \nI cant explain everything on the top of my head but if im TA i just want to know \n(Also if theres typos or incorrect grammar sorry )", "created_utc": 1686819227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149x9o7/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_shouldnt_have_a_baby/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you spoken to any adult you trust about it, e.g. at school or to a doctor?", "YNTA. Your mom is totally irresponsible and I feel sorry for you and that new baby. Go live in a place that supports you finishing school, and get the hell out of there. Look out for what\u2019s best for you as you have a long future to look forward to.", "Nta.\n\nYour mom may be trying to have this baby as an anchor baby to lock down her relationship with her boyfriend. To keep him from leaving her.

You would be the full time babysitter if you made the error of staying around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom needs to take responsibility for her own life.

Livng with her is already hurting you, don't let it get worse.", "NTA\n\nFrom what you\u2019re describing, your mother has never taken care of you and you\u2019ve clearly been taking care of her and yourself. I suggest you go live with your father or grandmother, because once that baby comes the neglect will probably multiply. You\u2019re not supposed to be responsible for everything around the house and I don\u2019t think your mother will start taking any responsibility. You moving away will allow you to focus on yourself, and not you taking on her duties.", "Your mother is a hot ass mess and needs people who love her enough to be honest with her.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s important that your mom and her boyfriend take financial responsibility for having babies instead of relying on your uncle. You might want to ask your family to set some boundaries so they don't end up enabling her behavior by constantly giving her money whenever she wants to start a family without taking on the responsibilities that come with it.", "ESH.\n\nYou can not force someone to have an abortion, however unwise her decision to have another baby is, she's pregnant and that's that. It's her decision what she does thereafter.\n\nYou're not an asshole for being concerned and not wanting her to have a baby, considering she has been a bad mother to you. You're not even an asshole for voicing your concern to your mother. But I'd say you're slightly an asshole if you keep pushing for an abortion, it's not your decision.\n\nThe not knowing her partner long is irrelevant. People don't need to be in a long term relationship or even any relationship to have a baby. Co-parenting can still happen between parents not together.\n\nI do think your mum is wrong to be selling your dogs and moving you about to accommodate the new baby. But as I said, she's already pregnant and you do what you have to in that situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Literally. \n\nYou are not responsible for your mother\u2019s decisions. You are also not responsible for her well-being. You\u2019re 13! You should be in an environment where YOU are being cared for BY YOUR PARENT, not the other way around. Is it right for you to tell your mom to have an abortion? No. But your reasoning - at least from what I read - is because the child /she already has/ is being neglected. You. And you deserve to feel loved, valued, and cared for by your parent. \n\nYou are a child. I\u2019m not saying that to diminish your points, but to remind everyone that YOU ARE A CHILD.  \n\nShe has a responsibility to care for you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this \u2014 if nothing else, as someone who was in a very similar situation, know that it will get better. \n\nHang in there.

They will be able to help you and your dogs find better accommodations, whether that\u2019s with your father, grandmother, or someone else.  Therapists are trained to help children and teenagers in situations like these.  \n\nI\u2019m really sorry this is happening to you.  You might find some community and advice in r/raisedbynarcissists.  I lurk on that sub, and your story sounds like you would fit right in.
