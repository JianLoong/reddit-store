I\u2019m so sorry.", "INFO  why is he taking just your brother? has he always played favourites?", "NTA.\n\nYour stepsisters are your dad's responsibility.

Nor should he try to guilt trip you.\n\nFurthermore you've told him you are unsure about whether you will be able to take proper care of them, e.g. during an emergency. That's a genuine concern that he should take seriously. Instead he seems more concerned about the holiday.", "NTA at all!\n\nOh, he'll remember this?

Why did he not confirm that he had childcare sorted before he planned this trip? Your dad needs to put on his big boy pants, it's not your job to take care of your step siblings so he can go on holiday. It's also a big AH move to only take one of his children with him.", "NTA. Your dad is sexist. You're not good enough to go on a holiday with him, but good enough for unpaid babysitting? He's not being a good father, to you, your sister, brother or your step siblings.\n\nI also have to ask about the comment regarding their mother. He doesn't allow her to see them? Those are his step children. Does he have sole custody? What about their father? Why does he get to make the choices about other people's children, how come he gets to decide that their own mother can't see them? He's their stepfather, not their biological father. I would begin making enquiries to child protective services, because something seems fishy here. I worry for your stepsiblings.\n\nYou and your sister should keep lines of communication open with your stepsiblings (if they want) and limit contact with your father and brother. He is quite sexist and is raising his son to be exactly like him. Your brother shows no concern for the amount of stress your father put on you, rather that he may not get (yet another) holiday.
