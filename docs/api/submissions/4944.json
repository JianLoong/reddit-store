He sounds mean enough to take away your university funding so I guess you need to protect that, but he sure isn\u2019t doing this right. I\u2019m so sorry.", "INFO  why is he taking just your brother? has he always played favourites?", "NTA.\n\nYour stepsisters are your dad's responsibility. He can ask you to take care of them as a favor, a huge favor that is, but he can and should not make it your problem. Nor should he try to guilt trip you.\n\nFurthermore you've told him you are unsure about whether you will be able to take proper care of them, e.g. during an emergency. That's a genuine concern that he should take seriously. Instead he seems more concerned about the holiday.", "NTA at all!\n\nOh, he'll remember this? You'll remember the time you wanted to go on holiday with him but he didn't want you there, and instead ask you to look over kids that weren't even yours.\n\nHe's using you. And just a general asshole.", "NTA, and there\u2019s so much wrong with this I don\u2019t even know where to start, tbh. You\u2019re not even equipped to handle 2 kids, esp over Christmas. Is the 6yo upset because your dad is leaving him for Christmas? (You mentioned Christmas so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s your holiday). HTF are you expected to do this? your dad is a huge asshole. \n\nBUT I am gonna warn you to prepare him to withdraw all financial support if you say no. Because that\u2019s exactly what an AH like him is gonna do next. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry.", "Definitely NTA I get the impression that your dad is though. Is he a misogynist? It's an awkward age gap between your half-sibling's mother and him and a bad sign that he seems to have so many cut ties.", "NTA\n\nWhy is your dad making plans to go away with just one of his children, and expecting you to look after the rest of his children? Why did he not confirm that he had childcare sorted before he planned this trip? Your dad needs to put on his big boy pants, it's not your job to take care of your step siblings so he can go on holiday. It's also a big AH move to only take one of his children with him.", "NTA. Your dad is sexist. You're not good enough to go on a holiday with him, but good enough for unpaid babysitting? He's not being a good father, to you, your sister, brother or your step siblings.\n\nI also have to ask about the comment regarding their mother. He doesn't allow her to see them? Those are his step children. Does he have sole custody? What about their father? Why does he get to make the choices about other people's children, how come he gets to decide that their own mother can't see them? He's their stepfather, not their biological father. I would begin making enquiries to child protective services, because something seems fishy here. I worry for your stepsiblings.\n\nYou and your sister should keep lines of communication open with your stepsiblings (if they want) and limit contact with your father and brother. He is quite sexist and is raising his son to be exactly like him. Your brother shows no concern for the amount of stress your father put on you, rather that he may not get (yet another) holiday. They are both being selfish, and you don't owe either of them anything.", "NTA. It's not you watching them for a few hours, is a whole week. With a 6yr old and valid concerns about safety. I wouldn't feel comfortable in your situation even at 25. Without a car, in a rented house, a 6yr old that barely knows me.  Yea he needs to hire an actual babysitter with access to a car who can respond in case of emergency.", "NTA. They are not your responsibility. You don't make their life difficult, they did it when they didn't think about a babysitter or anything to watch the kids.", "NTA It's not a child's responsibility to care for their siblings.", "NTA - they're his kids, his obligation.\n\nNo is a complete sentence, but if you want, explain to him that it's not safe as you can't walk or drive and you don't even know them that much.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure why he wants you instead of your sister who offered, but it sounds like he has a perfectly valid option.", "Totally NTA.   This is way too much.  If dad needs a vacation, he can go and leave brother to help you", "Definitely NTA.  The whole situation sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  If anything I\u2019d reach out to your stepsister, if you can get her number, and make sure those kids aren\u2019t left alone when he goes.  And if they are, call CPS.", "NTA. Your dad is an AH. Seems like he treats you and sinking very differently, which isn\u2019t cool. You have valid reasons for not doing this, he needs to accept that or figure out other arrangements. Your brother has no say in how you manage your life.", "INFO: if he pulls his support for your uni will you be able to handle it and factor in debt taken on or is your education fully reliant on him??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd tell him I'm very happy to provide him with this PAID BABYSITTING SERVICE at the rate of $50 an hour PREPAID IN CASH.

He's a major A for expecting you to sit at home with HIS KIDS while he and your brother prance around like frat boys!

Not just because your dad says no.", "He has always played favorites. Hes taken my brother on fancy vacations to America, Europe and now Asia. The reason for taking him on vacation this time round is because my brother \u2018wanted to travel for christmas\u2019.

And to then prevent them from seeing their mother? I would get in contact with her and let her take the kids home. And what about their other family members? Does their mum have any? What about their father? Why has everyone just left them with an abusive man? \n\nAnd he thinks he has the right to be mad at her for not being able to spend Xmas with her kids? When he's the one who stops her from seeing them? Definitely report him. I think you should at least try, though I do recognise that nothing may happen. \n\nHousekeepers generally aren't qualified to be nannies. They are employed to take care of the house, not the children. He isn't even providing them with a proper caretaker when he leaves them (no hate to the housekeeper, I'm sure they are lovely.
