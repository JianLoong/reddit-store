We dated for about a year but broke up because he was very emotionally distant and I felt like I was doing all the emotional labor.\n\nI own the house that we live in, for starters. Since he's moved in he's only had part time remote work. Originally claimed he'd be going full time soon. Initially I wasn't asking for rent because he could not manage to pay his share of rent and I thought it was short term.\n\nOriginally when we moved into the house I wanted roommates. He wanted to just have it the two of us as we'd just started dating. I agreed on the basis we'd split the bills 50/50. It was only a few months later and he was still saying that he'd be full time at the job soon. This went on with me paying everything for months, though occasionally he would get help from his mother when it came to groceries. Earlier this year I had two friends move in to help with bills and because both were in bad situations. \n\nI'm now in a new job where I work from home and I've realized all he does is play video games other than the maybe 8 hours he works a week. I've been working full time and running door dash to try and make ends meet.  I've often done without despite going out of my way for him. For example I made sure he had Christmas and birthday gifts but he got me nothing on either.\n\nHis mother has been giving him money each month to put towards groceries. Other than that, all expenses have fallen to me and this year in May when we were still together I asked him to start paying $100 a week towards house expenses. He's inconsistent at best with payments. Since the break up almost two months ago he has not paid me any rent.\n\nSo I'm at the point where I want to tell him he needs to move out by the end of January because it's emotionally draining to constantly deal with him and it's not fair to any of us that he's not paying his part. There's also more going on at the he interpersonal level. If I kick him out he'd more than likely have to move back in with his mom. So if I told him he had to move out would I be the asshole?\n\nEdit: A lot of people seem to think 3 months is generous. That's based on what friends suggested and honestly it's also as a courtesy to his mother because I worry it's going to get dumped on her. He originally lived several states away before moving in with me which makes things a bit more complicated.  My hope is it won't take that long for him to move though.", "created_utc": 1697676292, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b68b7/wibta_for_kicking_my_ex_out_with_3_months_notice/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t know why you feel responsible for him. So he moves back in with his mother? Who cares ? Not your problem. \n\nAnd these other friends that moved in because they\u2019re going through a hard time - please don\u2019t let that be another case where you are taken advantage of.", "No, NTA at all. Why on earth should he just be allowed to keep freeloading off of you? I mean, not trying to be harsh but the reason he\u2019s still doing it is because you\u2019re letting him. Evict him in writing.", "NTA \n\nBut why wait? He's had over a year get his shit together and he hasn't. His gaming has always been #1, work is maybe #2 and you're in 3rd place. \n\nGive him 30 days. He can go back to his enabler mommy.", "NTA. It's pretty clear what's happening here is that you are getting used and taken advantage of. He may deny that but the proof is in the pudding, you know? He is a full grown, capable adult and there's zero reason you should be paying his way. 3 months is beyond ample notice. Generous, even. If he has to live with his mom, oh well, not your problem.", "NT@. 3 months is generous. Give him written notification of the move out date and note how much he owes you.\nYou deserve better.", "NTA. In fact, you should give him less time because he would probably drag things out and try to change your mind. Give him one month and if he's not out, pack his shit, get his key, and put his stuff outside.\n\nHe's taking advantage of you.", "In no universe are you the AH. Three months is beyond generous. He can go live with his mom.", "Three months notice!! I\u2019d give him a week.", "NTA for getting rid of dead weight. Why should he change if people keep enabling his freeloading ways.", "Honestly, Y T A for allowing yourself to be taken advantage of for so long, but YWNBTA for kicking him out.

It's worth your while to make sure you've touched all the legal bases so that he can't push things back.\n\nPresent him with a bill for overdue rent and an eviction notice for non-payment of rent. Offer not to sue if he gets out promptly.", "NTA - 3 months is being generous. He can move in with friends and family. A month should be enough. If he saw you working overtime and an extra job, but didn\u2019t bother to do more to help, that\u2019s should be enough for you.", "NTA\n\nThree months is too generous, OP please consider that once he realizes you're serious about him leaving he will start to make your life a living hell., and go from lazy to dangerous.\n\nConfer with a lawyer, get some camera, hide your valuable.", "NTA, seems like he\u2019s definitely mooching off of you. It\u2019s your home, he doesn\u2019t deserve the grace and kindness you have given him so far. If he didn\u2019t want to get kicked out he should have carried his weight and been a contributing party. He forked around and found out.

You sound like you're just fine with being taken advantage of.", "Nta for giving him notice to leave, y t a for giving him so long to do it. \n\n1 month is all he should need to move his stuff into his mother's.", "NTA. You are allowing yourself to be used and taken advantage of and you know it. That said. I would have his shit on the front porch before the sun came up.", "NTA, except to yourself. \nYou\u2019re going to have to endure way too much time with this low life. He\u2019s not your responsibility. Shorten the notice and save your sanity.", "NTA, but you and his mother are doing him no favours. The longer he is allowed to continue this lifestyle, the more deeply entrenched his entitlement to it will be. Plus, he isn\u2019t learning to support himself. What would happen if his mother and you were no longer able to support and house him? How will he learn to survive and thrive if he is never forced to try. Sadly, some baby birds (and this is no baby) need to be pushed out of the nest. Wishing you all the best.", "NTA and I agree that three months is way too long to deal with him after how long you already have. I can just imagine the whining and conversations you\u2019re gonna have to deal with for 90 days. I\u2019d cut it at the end of the year.", "Wow it's like people forget you might have loved someone at some point prior to this.\n\nYou're being kind. It's okay. \n\nNTA", "I wouldn't give him three months.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA. I\u2019d say three months notice for an ex to move out is more than generous, they should be able to find a place to stay in that amount of time.", "NTA... 3 months is too long. Don't accept rent as you want this guest to leave.\n\nYou need to stand up for yourself and stop enabling this boy. It's not helping him or you.", "He's a bum. Kick him out tomorrow and be done with it.", "NTA.  Do yourself a favor....set a deadline of mid-December.  Get that MF out of your life.  Best Christmas gift you will ever have.  Don't worry about his momma.  Not your problem.", "Usually, in most us states, once they pay rent they gain renters rights and you can\u2019t just evict them without following whatever process exists in the state.\n\nIf he\u2019s a guest and not a renter, you usually don\u2019t even have to give notice at all no matter the duration of stay.\n\nThe possibilities get even worse if you support this person by creating a shared bank account, or putting them on your insurance.  These things can be used to prove common law marriage in some states, entitling them to half of your stuff.  If you have stuff.", "You broke up 2 months ago, so in August, yet you are allowing him to stay until the end of January? Five months in total!\n\nYou are being far too generous. He is not your child and he is not your responsibility.  He had a place to go, you should have booted him out the door as soon as you broke up. Stop being a doormat and tell him to get out.", "He's been mooching off you for two years. No, of course you WNBTA. If he has to move in with his mother, that's on him, not you.", "NTA\n\nYou're not a jerk at all! You should give him the minimum. I'd be worried about damage.", "NTA. Give him 30 days notice and be prepared to go through formal eviction proceedings.", "NTA\nJanuary is ridiculous..  Why not Saturday??  I read your edit. You are not responsible for this grown man.  Tell him today,  he's out Saturday,  somebody else is moving in (doesn't matter if it's a lie)  and if he's not out by noon you will  start flinging his shit out the windows. Stop thinking you need to help him,  you don't. He can help himself of he just gets up off hos backside. Get rid of him now.  Watch your bills go down and your happiness go up.", "Not your responsibility. He needs to get out now. Stop enabling him. \n\nSo what if he gets dumped on his mom? Not your problem. Currently seems like he is dumped on you and you have a dependent child not an ex boyfriend", "He can't afford rent because he doesn't work enough. And he has had no reason to work, because both you and his mother pay all of his bills. You are creating and maintaining your own problem here, and it is YOU that needs to change your behavior. Give him notice according to the law in your state IN WRITING, both physically handed to him and emailed to him with a received receipt. If you know his mother, let her know you've given him notice, too, so he can't loe to her or pretend he didn't know when he has to be out. And prepare for the worst. He's been living off of you for a very long time, and he won't like that his benefactor is closing the wallet. He will be sad, mad, pathetic, sullen, panicky, depressed, whatever he thinks will make you feel bad enough to change your mind. Don't fall for it, don't negotiate and don't entertain any conversations about \"what if: and how it's all gonna change any minute now. If he's gonna change, it'llhave to be somewhere else, because he can't live there any more. Even if he pays rent for the next 3 months, which he won't. \n\nNTA. Be dispassionate, clear and firm.", "NTA. Just don't be surprised when the end of January is around the corner, and he's going to act like you haven't given him enough time to move out.", "Get him out he is clearly taking advantage of you", "This. OP, he's leeching off of you. Give a formal, written 30 day notice. Tell him you've been more than generous with him, and after him not paying bills for this long, he should have A LOT of money saved up. He's not your responsibility. Why drag this out? He's not going to be any more ready to move out in 3 months. He'll just keep guilting you and stretching it out. You can tell his mom you just couldn't do it any more. If she wants to help him, that's on her.", "I appreciate the concern, while they had to find jobs because of moving to the new city it was a constant search and they'd ask me for help finding opportunities because I'm well connected. Both are working full time and paying their share plus they've been voluntarily giving me extra because it took like 3 months for them to find a steady job in a safe location.", "I'm definitely going to and have the message ready to do so. Unfortunately I had one of my rare work trips and am not comfortable giving the news to him when I will be out of the house for another week after this. \n\nI guess I was just holding out hope that he was a better person than he was acting.", "Please don't insult his mother like that, she's been very sweet in helping us out with the groceries. He definitely takes advantage of her, and there have been points when we were dating that I talked more to her than him.", "I appreciate it, there's a lot of other stuff that went on and comes into play but unfortunately character limits are in the way", "Thanks for being kind, it doesn't feel great to have people telling me I'm an asshole for letting it go on this long because you're right. I did love and care about him at one point and our relationship really drifted apart because things didn't improve.", "Try not to announce so loudly to the world that you're a doormat who enjoys being walked all over", "Why? He has showed you who he is why do you think that your kindness is going to change him. \n\nIt is not your job to change him but to change yourself. If you are done with him taking advantage, then just let his mom know that he is out and that all the locks will be changed. If he comes back, then he will be escorted off the property by police. \n\nNo point in trying to change him, try to work on yourself.", "It's not an insult, it's a fact. By giving him money she is also giving him the ok to do nothing but play video games all day. He isn't putting in any effort because he know his mom (and you) will pay his way for him.", "But she IS enabling him and his lifestyle, certainly not helping him to be independent. \n\nHe's 25 years old, working maybe 8 hours a week when he should be working 40 hours a week. You don't mention anything about him going to college full time. He's spending his time gaming instead of looking for full time work while you're working full time PLUS doing DoorDash to help make end meet!\n\nI want you to think about this: What would happen if his mom DIDN'T give him money to put toward groceries? Hmmmm??\n\nWhen I was 18 and going to college, I worked 32-40 hours a week. When I was 25 years old, I had a nursing degree and was about to put a down payment on my house.", "Neither of them are your responsibility. You can't let other people's dysfunctionality take over your life - certainly not after you have broken up with them. You need to break up with her as much as break up with him. It's going to be shitty for both of them and you need to stay disengaged or you will do yourself harm. You've already been ten times more patient and generous than you should have been. The fact that you could type up the entire OP and still have doubts is very worrying about your perspective on this. Their lives are their own, their problems are their own. Say goodbye.", "You're a fool.", "He takes advantage of everyone. You\u2019ve been paying for your ex to live in your home for a year after dumping him? You feed him and put a roof over his head while he sits on his ass and plays videos games. Glad you finally recognized how dumb this situation is. Give him a month.", "It happens, however some people can take advantage of kindness. So when you give your out date stick to it. \n\nGood luck.", "Thank you!! Well said!!", "Good advice!"]}
