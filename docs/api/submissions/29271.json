Since the manager obviously isn't putting an end to the problem, I'd contact the local health department and file a formal complaint.", "NTA\n\nThe 30y/o who acts like a toddler needs to be schooled in the propriety of urinating in a baby's toilet and missing. \n\nIt wouldn't have ever been a real problem if the idiots hadn't peed all over the floor.     \n\nThis is disgusting.  \n\nYou should remind them that boys with bigg peeppees go in the big boys bathroom and boys with little pee-pees goe in the little bathroom.   Just have to hope neither of them have a small penis.  \n\n\nOH, and they should be required to clean that bathroom floor.", "I would have said a lot more than that.  I would actually report them to management/owners AND authorities.  Why are they going into a child's bathroom?  Seems rather creepy and criminal at the same time.  NTA  Good luck!", "NTA\nTell those guys if they insist on using the tiny toilet, they should work on their squats by SITTING down to pee. \n\nThey should also be handed paper towels, disinfecting wipes/mops/whatever so they can clean up their own biohazard. \n\nManagement should be notified, too.", "No . It's not like they don't have another option and the least you can do is clean after you . So if. they can't use a toilet like a grown up they shouldn't us it at all . It is more excusable for kids  to leave a mess but grown up men should know better  . do they expect their moms or their gf to clean after them ?", "NTA and honestly, you should keep humiliating them over it. I would learn their names and make sure EVERYONE knows. \"Welp, I guess Jake used the children's bathroom again. You always know it's him cause he can't actually make it in the toilet.\" \"Hey, Brandon, I noticed you're not able to make it to the toilet at all, do you have an incontinence problem? Because I can definitely recommend the brand of adult diapers my grandfather uses.\" Or, complain loudly with the other women at the front desk where people are coming in about how 2 grown men keep going into the children's bathroom and it's making you uncomfortable. (I know it's bad to insinuate anything like that last bit, but maybe it will scare them enough to stop doing it, because honestly WHY are they doing it)", "NTA - they should be publicly shamed, with a bell and all that.", "NTA. Honestly what is it with guys and being slobs about pee on the floor - that's not appropriate in ANY bathroom, much less one they aren't supposed to use. If there aim is that bad, they should:  \n\\- clean up their own spillage  \n\\- actually work to improve their aim  \n\\- until they learn how to \"use their equipment\" better, try a larger target - like an adult toilet.", "NTA. Ew. Why can't they used their adult legs to walk 30 seconds and leave the toilet for the wee ones?", "Fuck no. Nta that\u2019s just gross", "NTA.\n\nThese are grown men who lack common sense.", "NTA. Adults should use adult spaces.", "This is downright creepy behavior", "It\u2019s a safeguarding issue.", "NTA, I'm a man, and I'm here to tell you men's bathroom habits in general are disgusting. Anytime I go to a public restroom, I'd say only about 1/4 of them actually wash their hands, and out of that 1/4 only about half do it properly. They'll just run their hands under the water for a few seconds and dry them off. \n\nThey piss all over the seats and floor, or shake their dicks off and it goes everywhere, or they piss in the urinals (I don't use them unless no other option is available, and even then I'll wait for a stall if I can.) which splashes back on them, the floor and their shoes. Seriously, go look at the floor in front of a urinal and you'll see there's specks of dried urine sprinkles everywhere. I hate using public restrooms. I'm not saying women aren't gross too, but I don't use women's restrooms.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBEcause you just assume.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
