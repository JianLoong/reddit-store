A few months ago my BFs mother called the police on him and accused him of abusing her. \n\nHe admits that they have had verbal fights and he always tries to walk away but she pushes him into walls and pushes until he reacts.

Stop. Just stop engaging. Tell her next time she shows up on your property you will call the police and then block her. As for BF, if he\u2019s encouraging this drama, you need to take a step back and reevaluate the relationship there too.", "NTA, please call the police the next time you see her, and consider filing for a restraining order. Get a lawyer now and see what you can do to get her to cease and desist. This will be a long drawn-out legal battle but neither of you should have contact with this dangerous person going forward.", "NTA, but you should have told her to stop trying to talk to you, blocked her, and gone completely no contact with her.\n\nShe is an *abuser*.  She is manipulating you so she can continue her abuse.\n\nSTOP interacting with her.  Call the police if she shows up and won't leave.", "I am *very* tempted to give you a Y T A, and here is why:\n\nYou are enabling an abuser.\n\nBlock this woman. If she shows up at your house, tell her she needs to leave and the next time she shows up, you'll call the police and file for a restraining order. \n\nNTA for not giving her info, but stop giving her access altogether.", "NTA\n\nBut I will say two things,\n\n1. Considering she knows where you live and your number, you and your BF do need to discuss how you are going to navigate her going forward.\n2. You need to make sure if you are going to continue a relationship with him, that he has come counseling and gets help, as those kinds of interactions can become part of conflict cycle between you and him as well.", "You're just 22, why are you so invested in hanging onto this guy and his dysfunctional family? It's probably going to get worse not better. NTA for wanting not to engage with her but open your eyes already.", "NTA. She sounds dangerous and highly unstable. I agree with other comments, get a restraining order. And go No-Contact. Block her number. Block her social media accounts. You don\u2019t need to feel guilt because *she\u2019s not your responsibility*. She is an adult who chose to abuse her son, and harass you. The consequences are for her alone to deal with. I admire your compassion, but it\u2019s misplaced on an abuser. Share that compassion w/ your boyfriend, who has just had a major life change. Best of luck, stay safe OP.", "NTA, it is her fault for her relationship deteriorating. You don't need to tell her shit. Tell her to back off from you and if he wants to talk to her son, she should try to contact him. It is her fault that her son won't talk to her.", "NTA, as many others have suggested get a restraining order, accuse her for harassment and causing mental disturbance. Let your leasing agent know that shes not welcome (if you live in a apartment or closed community) she did this to herself. What a horrible human being must she be that her own child doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her . Respect his wishes , his was of healing is by cutting her toxicity out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he wanted to, he would.", "NTA  Do not get in the middle of this, ever.", "NTA. Every time she behaves obsessively or crazily, it must confirm your suspicions that she lied about her son being violent. He sounds like an abuse victim, and you need to document everything (as you are doing) , and get security advice.", "NTA.  Your BF wants to go NC with Mom, so you would **betray** him if you gave her information.  Block her number and avoid her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She is now calling me daily\" .. stop answering her calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"SHE ROCKED UP AT MY HOUSE! She came unannounced and accused me of lying to her and that I am the cause of her and her sons relationship deteriorating.\" .. DO not engage. Do not let your bf engage. Just call the police, and get a restraining order.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I feel like everything would not have escalated to this point if I just put her mind at peace.2 .. sadly, it is VERY unliely that would have worked.", "NTA and no ma'am! I CANNOT stand people popping up at my house. Grew up with a very nosy family so it's a BIG pet peeve. I would be NC with her, ban her from your home, and call the police if she comes back.", "Luckily I have blocked her. She has no way of contacting me. I'm just feel guilty and I have no idea why. Thank you", "She has been blocked and I have given to my complex and my family is aware of the situation. \n\nIf there is another incident I will definitely go this route.", "Funny enough I did not think of her trying to manipulate me and I feel dumb for that but you're right she's finding ways to take control again.", "For a very long time I tried to fix their relationship without knowing the full history and I found myself trying to give him perspective from her side which is damaging in itself and I stopped because I know that he does not need to think about anyone else but him moving forward and doing what's best for him. \n\nI think that's why I feel guilty because I did not take it as serious as I should have ( granted all i saw was arguing over small issues ) and I've told him that I regret ever trying to be Switzerland because he had the experiences that I can't even imagine.", "So a condition his family (cousins) has given him is that he need to start going to therapy and he has been our this house for about 4 months and has not made a single call to a therapist which his been bothering me and has been a touchy subject.  I don't want to nag and push him to do something he does not want to do but it's always excuse after excuse.", "Clich\u00e9 but I love him and I see so much potential and he is doing so much better out of home...that should count for something right?", "How is he dysfunctional? because he wants to get away from an abusive parent?", "Thank you\ud83c\udf38 \n\nI'll make sure to go no-contact. \nI think I need to stop doubting myself. Thanks everyone for the help! I've got lots to think about and a plan of action. I did not see her as a real threat but the biggest flag is that she rocked up and that could have be dangerous in itself.", "Remember that you're *protecting a victim*. You should absolutely never feel guilt about that.", "Hopefully that isn\u2019t something that your bf has added to and that he isn\u2019t showing the same behaviors with you - please pay attention to what he shows you during this time and remember that you deserve the best.", "It's actually a bad idea to block her. You can mute her but you should have those texts/vmails coming through to use against her in the restraining order.\n\nAnd I cannot emphasize this enough: GET SECURITY CAMERAS.", "Which is definitely not a good sign. If he's not willing to do the work, then you need to make a clean break. Because all that is going to happen is you are going be experiencing the abuse going forward. This is a cycle that has caught many people throughout the years.", "Just because someone has toxic parents they are trying to get away from is no reason to abandon the person you love. It may be difficult but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s worth it to you. Good luck!", "Maybe I should change my mindset as I don't ever see him as a victim and he does not show that side of how it effected him emotionally other than him being frustrated and that's dangerous in itself.", "I think he is trying to find his footing and is not putting any of this on me. He understands why I feel unsafe.", "I have endless screenshots and test messages plus the spam calls. \n\nLuckily she has not tried to contact me since the last incident and my complex has security cameras but I'll definitely purchase a few for my home.", "I feel like this response is defending him. \nHe has had really bad experiences with therapy. He is happy to attend but his only condition is that they have a group session and she says she is not the one with the problem and I think he feels as if he is not the problem. \n\nSo therapy feels redundant because nothing will be \"fixed\" but in the end I know he should go to try and work him his trauma and move forward.  \n\nWe stuck in this endless cycle of the blame game.", "Exactly.  Just because his family have issues does not make him a bad person. I'll be patient and work with him to overcome this hurdle. I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. I just want him to be the best version of himself.", "His mother is abusive. He is the victim of abuse. It's not about whether you can see the emotional damage or not. It's about the actions of the abuser.", "That's good, but you're going to want to keep aggregating those screenshots. Trust me, I have had to get restraining orders on family members."]}
