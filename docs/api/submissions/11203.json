There seems to be a lot of conflict and drama in these relationships you've described. Maybe the circumstances of the divorce were such that you have reasons for being hostile.

You have a horrible co parenting relationship.", "ESH. I don't support lying to get your way, especially when the excuse of it is something as superficial and passive aggressive as \"putting yourself together\".

You could have even just stayed in the house and hung out with your son while your waited for the guests. It was only an hour and a half.\n\nThings that didn't matter in the outcome of your story: the entitlement of demanding your son be present for an event on your week. You asked your son, he said he wanted to go, you didn't have to accommodate this, but you did. You then arrive 30 minutes later than when they told you the party was going to start, so it's not like you're doing your best not to make waves either.

You both need to learn to coparent better.", "NTA\n\nThey weren't honest with you. Your Ex could have called you to tell you about the new pregnancy. They didn't need to trick you ahead of time. It was kind of you to show up with your child on your own parenting time. \n\nNext time you speak with them let them know they need to be honest with you or you will never be flexible with your own parenting time again. If you don't make a clear boundary they will do this more especially if they're making more children. They'll want to do more family parties, more vacations when it may be on your time. It would be nice if you could both be flexible with each other - but honesty and open communication is key here. They have to play ball too for it to work.\n\nGood luck OP.

He really seems to love drama. I would like to know what kinda reaction they wanted. You sobbing on the floor while they can be the bigger person and comfort you?

Yeah.\n\n But OP you knew that your son wanted to go to the party. You should have said Kay bye see you at two. You just invited them to trash talk you to your son. Parental alienation is very hard to prove so it's only going to create a toxic co parenting relationship.", "I doubt he legitimately thought I would be upset, he just lives for drama.\n\nHe was, but no longer is, because we are divorced and they are married now.

It's devious and underhanded, but so is my ex.", "Because it was my week, so he has to be with me.\n\nI wasn't angry about the party. I was frustrated by how entitled she was about the situation. If she had said \"would you mind bringing (son) to my daughter's birthday party?\" I would have said I'll ask him and if he wants to go I will bring him (which is what I did). But by saying \"my daughter's birthday is during your week do you want to bring him over the day of or night before?\" she implied I had no choice. Her daughter's birthday doesn't impact the custody agreement. She needs to ask for things, not demand them.", "Yeah, it does have to be one or the other. If you have split custody it's a very bad idea to ever leave your kid with the other parent on your time. My lawyer told me not to do that and to tell him if my ex ever leave our son with me on his week.", "Birthday parties rarely start on the dot. Every birthday party I've been to has had about an hour of socializing in the beginning as people arrive, get stuff put away, etc... I didn't want to be the first one there.

I wonder if new wife was an AP though. that would make the attitude make more sense. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t you want to co parent nicely ?", "Ah, but if he was honest with me, he wouldn't have gotten his soap opera moment. He is, after all, the main character of life and we are all just supporting players in his story. /S\n\nJokes aside, you're right, but that's never going to happen. He's allergic to honesty. The only reason I didn't suspect trickery was because his wife made the request, not him, but I guess he's rubbed off on her.", "I'm sure that was his fantasy. He's always preferred fantasy to reality. I thought it was romantic when I was young and stupid. Unfortunately, I too was made of flesh and bone. So he tired of me quickly. But it's fine.

The wife wanted the son at the party, which he also wanted to go to, and she gave OP two options to get him there, but apparently that made her entitled because OP \"didn't have to do anything\" - I get the impression getting OP to do anything is an effort. They told OP a time two hours early, OP turned up half an hour late. I expect they were desperately trying to avoid OP kicking up a stink in the middle of the party. My ex said he needed to talk to me, I told him that wasn't necessary? I guess he should have just said okay and let her draw her own conclusions when she saw his visibly pregnant wife. OP couldn't cope with being around but rather than leave the son there, let him enjoy himself and make arrangements for son to spend an extra day with OP to make up for it, OP takes her son and storms out then flat out lies to him to pretend that he's not missing a party because she had a hissy fit. I don't know what reward she expected ex and Mrs to be getting from their lies and trickery - the pleasure of her company for an hour and a half? But then bending the truth, yes, technically there was a mixup with the time but son did not miss the party and is ex now expected to arrange another celebration? OP's lies meant she got to have a nice day at the park basking in how wronged she is in every way and how righteous she is to punish her evil ex.\n\nYTA for lying to your son and you sound like a nightmare generally.", "NTA, they are crazy and rude", "NTA um no, ew, who wants to spend an hour and a half with an ex and their new family... and then entertain with their friends for another two hours.

The fact that you said they sounded entitled makes me think that you just don\u2019t value the time your son spends with his ex\u2019s new family. Similarly with you saying the sister is only 1 - this would mean that your son is the one with most memories of the event so he is the one being penalised for this dispute.\n\n2) considering you arrived half an hour late to the assigned time, I would imagine the family has good reason to give you an earlier time. Plus, it makes sense to involve the family (your son) in the preparations, you don\u2019t have to hang out with them. \n\n3) the claim that your lawyer said it\u2019s bad for you to switch time in the custody arrangements is obviously one to do with context.

If they have a pregnancy announcement they can send it to you in an email or text. The theatrics are insulting and unnecessary.

Why not plan every birthday or fun get together during your week, since they know you\u2019ll give in to make your son happy?

Giving you the wrong time on purpose was just an AH move no matter the reason and their weird delusion of what they thought your reaction would be. I lean to ESH when it comes to taking your son and having him miss his sisters party. Yes he can celebrate when he goes back for his time with his dad, but when you have split and blended families, you have to put your adult stuff aside and really make it about the kids. He said he wanted to go to his sisters party, which you did right by taking him, but in the end he should have stayed because that's what he wanted....BUT it most definitely should've been flipped on the dad and new wife that it was now their responsibility for bringing him back home to you afterwards as you would not be staying for the extra time before or for the actual party because they felt the need to play games. I also agree that there is a limit to the whole being the bigger person thing, which is why I think NTA in some aspects but also why ESH in others.

I agree with you. My ex husband had an affair (well multiple as it now turns out) and got the girl pregnant. She was younger than his eldest child from his 1st marriage and he is now married to her.

I hadn't told my younger 2 as I'd worried they'd feel replaced (especially my son as they'd had a boy). My son's only response was that he felt so bad for that child and asked if we could pray for him. I'm so thankful for the advice my parents gave me along the way. I've never spoken a harsh word about their father to my children. I've encouraged them to forgive him and have done so myself.  My eldest daughter has asked why I forgive him since he doesn't deserve it. I explained to her that while he doesn't deserve it, my kids deserve my best and I wouldn't be a healthy mother to them if I was filled with hatred and bitterness. I asked her how she would feel if I spoke nasty about him all the time and hated him openly. Forgiveness is for me, not for him, but I also explained that doesn't mean we have to allow him into our lives to continue to harm us. You can forgive and still have firm boundaries.
