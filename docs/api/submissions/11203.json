It wasn't fair of them to manipulate you for an overly-dramatic baby reveal, it wasn't fair of you to prevent your son from going to his sister's party.

I'm sorry for your son, this sounds like a toxic co-parenting relationship, and it will only make him suffer for it in the end.", "ESH. Co-parenting is hard. They were assholes for lying about the time, but you are an asshole for not just leaving your son there till the party started. It\u2019s not always fair to be the one who always takes the high road, but by acting petty, you\u2019re just escalating the situation. Brush your shoulders off, OP, the best thing you can do to show they their shit is weak is to just not react at all.", "You sound exhausting. YTA.", "YTA \n\nI don't understand what your grievance is.  Was it that the party was at 2 and not noon? \n\n... You showed up 30 minutes late to the time you thought it would be.

You have zero obligation to your ex or his wife to do anything. However, you could've just left your son with them and dipped out yourself and than came back later to pick him up. It should've been all about the baby's birthday anyways. I don't see why you felt the need to stay or take your son away, that's still his sister.", "This whole thing is exhausting. You\u2019re all assholes and need to learn how to behave properly to put your child before everything else. This isn\u2019t about you and your ex. It\u2019s about your child. You both need to be more accommodating. At one point or another in the next 12+ years you\u2019ll both need favors from each other for your child. Figure out how to be peaceful for the child. It\u2019s not about you.  My ex and myself have 2 children together. We do it for the kids not us. You don\u2019t have to be friends with each other but you\u2019ll both get better results and live will be easier being nice and doing things you really don\u2019t have to do.", "ESH. The ex and his wife are more concerned with making drama about the children than they are about the kids themselves. OP is more concerned with the ex's drama and how it affects her and not her son. Ex and new wife didn't need 2 hours to announce their pregnancy to OP and, OP could have just smiled and nodded at the \"news\" and moved on to making a decent party for all of the kids.", "Sounds like YTA. Was there any reason why you couldn't just leave your son with his father and pick him up after the party?", "ESH. There seems to be a lot of conflict and drama in these relationships you've described. Maybe the circumstances of the divorce were such that you have reasons for being hostile. But even if you do, you're supposed to do what's best for your SON. He wanted to go to his sister's party. You could have left him with his father and gone home. They were AHs for telling you the wrong time, even if they figured you'd rant about her being pregnant, it's not cool to trick you. All of you should focus on doing what's best for your kid. Period.", "ESH they shouldn't have lied but you were also already turning up 30 min late to a one year old party surely these things don't last that long, if it had been at 12 noon were you trying to take control back by being late or were you avoiding conflict?", "ESH.\n\nI don't get the issue with your ex's wife being pregnant and the one year old is not going to care. That party was for the parents.\n\nBut you had another option : leaving your kid and come back to pick him up (or ask your ex to drive him back) later. \n\nThis could have been dealt with a lot more maturity by everybody.", "I think YTA.  It sounds like you\u2019ve historically behaved in ways that made your ex believe you would need over an hour to calm down after learning his new wife is pregnant.", "ESH. You have a horrible co parenting relationship.", "ESH. I don't support lying to get your way, especially when the excuse of it is something as superficial and passive aggressive as \"putting yourself together\". But your son obviously wanted to go, and while I don't know how much gas you actually had to waste, you could have taken your son to a park for a little bit before the party and driven back, or you could have wasted some time at a store while your son was at the party. You could have even just stayed in the house and hung out with your son while your waited for the guests. It was only an hour and a half.\n\nThings that didn't matter in the outcome of your story: the entitlement of demanding your son be present for an event on your week. You asked your son, he said he wanted to go, you didn't have to accommodate this, but you did. You then arrive 30 minutes later than when they told you the party was going to start, so it's not like you're doing your best not to make waves either. And it shouldn't matter if the wife if pregnant. The eyerolling is super judgmental though.\n\nHere's the truth: You didn't hurt the 1 year old. You hurt your son. You both need to learn to coparent better.", "NTA\n\nThey weren't honest with you. Your Ex could have called you to tell you about the new pregnancy. They didn't need to trick you ahead of time. It was kind of you to show up with your child on your own parenting time. \n\nNext time you speak with them let them know they need to be honest with you or you will never be flexible with your own parenting time again. If you don't make a clear boundary they will do this more especially if they're making more children. They'll want to do more family parties, more vacations when it may be on your time. It would be nice if you could both be flexible with each other - but honesty and open communication is key here. They have to play ball too for it to work.\n\nGood luck OP. Co parenting is not easy!", "ESH - They were dramatic and manipulative and you took it out on your son by not letting him attend a party he wanted to go to. A child should never be used as a pawn.", "YTA this is all so stupid why would you try to make your kid a pawn in your silly war", "ESH\n\nYes it was dumb of them to ask you to come an hour and a half early. But your kid wanted to go to the party, so it was wrong of you to remove him. The gas excuse is a lame one and you know it. If you didn't want to hang out there you could have just left the kid and gone to the park by yourself for a few hours, then come back to get him.", "NTA, but this was not best for your son.  Hopefully, in future, you can dig deeper and put his  needs first even when your ex behaves badly.\n\nFor now, this was harmless, but it won't always be so.", "So wait your ex intentionally kept the actual time from you so you would show up early. And all that just so he can tell you about the pregnancy in person and give you time to \"put yourself together\" afterwards as if it's some lifeshattering news to you?\nHell no NTA. He really seems to love drama. I would like to know what kinda reaction they wanted. You sobbing on the floor while they can be the bigger person and comfort you? And later they will tell everyone how hard it hit you and how nice they are for being there for you?\n\nWhatever weird kinda dream they had about this obv did not work. They could have been normal and told you the actual time. It was already nice of you to bring your son. I would have told them they can drive if they want him to join during your time.", "Honestly i feel sorry for your son that he have parent like you that uses him as a toy in her fight against the ex...YTA", "NTA- they are trying to see how far they can push manipulating you.\n\nYou compromised you time already. Now they want you to do what? Sit around?\n\nThe baby won\u2019t even know. Your son doesn\u2019t seem like he k owe the difference but if you give in to this, they will ramp it up in the future.", "ESH, I understand the complications with child custody. It would be bad for OP to just drop him off during her time. If her ex is vindictive. Considering he expected her to fall apart and need time to collect herself finding out the new wife is prego. Yeah.\n\n But OP you knew that your son wanted to go to the party. You should have said Kay bye see you at two. You just invited them to trash talk you to your son. Parental alienation is very hard to prove so it's only going to create a toxic co parenting relationship.", "I doubt he legitimately thought I would be upset, he just lives for drama.\n\nHe was, but no longer is, because we are divorced and they are married now. So that's the past.\n\nShe is my son's half sister through my ex.", "i knew it, i knew she must have been an AP. That explains the weird attitude from everyone, including OP.", "They also have the option of her not staying for the party. She insisted.", "Because if she lets them pull this nonsense and dictate HER time, after she already compromised, they will never stop.\n\nThis is still a form of emotional abuse", "Tell me you don\u2019t k is how custody works..they could also use this to trick her into seeming like she is abandoning her time", "No, it's a very, very bad idea to leave your kid with the other parent during your custody time. The other parent can then claim they have custody more than 50% of the time and take you back to court. It's devious and underhanded, but so is my ex.", "Because it was my week, so he has to be with me.\n\nI wasn't angry about the party. I was frustrated by how entitled she was about the situation. If she had said \"would you mind bringing (son) to my daughter's birthday party?\" I would have said I'll ask him and if he wants to go I will bring him (which is what I did). But by saying \"my daughter's birthday is during your week do you want to bring him over the day of or night before?\" she implied I had no choice. Her daughter's birthday doesn't impact the custody agreement. She needs to ask for things, not demand them.", "Yeah, it does have to be one or the other. If you have split custody it's a very bad idea to ever leave your kid with the other parent on your time. My lawyer told me not to do that and to tell him if my ex ever leave our son with me on his week.", "Birthday parties rarely start on the dot. Every birthday party I've been to has had about an hour of socializing in the beginning as people arrive, get stuff put away, etc... I didn't want to be the first one there. I wanted to make sure there were other people there so my ex couldn't try to talk to me.", "definitely, there is way more to this story. She also reads like a difficult person. I wonder if new wife was an AP though. that would make the attitude make more sense. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t you want to co parent nicely ?", "Ah, but if he was honest with me, he wouldn't have gotten his soap opera moment. He is, after all, the main character of life and we are all just supporting players in his story. /S\n\nJokes aside, you're right, but that's never going to happen. He's allergic to honesty. The only reason I didn't suspect trickery was because his wife made the request, not him, but I guess he's rubbed off on her.", "I'm sure that was his fantasy. He's always preferred fantasy to reality. I thought it was romantic when I was young and stupid. Unfortunately, I too was made of flesh and bone. So he tired of me quickly. But it's fine. He gave me a gift I'd never return. I won't begrudge him the pain. It thickened my skin, at least.", "I may be aggravating to some for saying this. You are going to have to have a \u201crelationship \u201c with this person and his wife and the child for years to come, BUT, I personally find permitting people to cause drama in my life, is my business. If they want a drama ridden life,(and it won\u2019t change), their business. You set boundaries and maintain them. Your son doesn\u2019t need an example of bad behavior getting attention.", "Ok, that is ridiculous. There is zero \"danger\" or risk to your custody arrangement in dropping off your child for a sibling's birthday party for a few hours. YTA.", "I gotcha. I read in another thread that she was an AP and deleted my post (but then you replied, sorry about that). Because it seems 100% reasonable for situations \nto be adversarial with her. And it IS rude for her to assume.\n\nActually I gotta agree with you in this case. Yeah, you sound angry. But why wouldn't you be angry? I feel bad for the kid because he wanted to go, but in that case, they should not intentionally fuck up the timetable.", "You sound exhausting affair or not your son's needs and wants come first. Get Therapy and heal yourself", "This is petty and vindictive. \n\nI grew up in a divorced family and this stuff was pretty traumatic until my parents stopped using me as a tool of their eternal grudge. \n\ngrow up.", "You could have just come back at 2.", "> Every birthday party I've been to has had about an hour of socializing in the beginning\n\nThat is the party starting. Really odd to turn up half an hour late for a kid's party.\n\n> I wanted to make sure there were other people there so my ex couldn't try to talk to me.\n\nSounds like a fantastic environment to bring up your son in.", "Lol well then he doesn't get flexibility from you. It's his choice.", "That's exactly what it is. They can have drama for themselves if they want drama, but I'm not playing their games. You lie to me? I leave. You want something from me? Ask nicely and be upfront. If you can't do that, not my problem.", "I don't know for 100% certainty that she knew he was married when the affair started. So I don't blame her for the affair. Even if she did know, she's not the one who made a vow to me, so it still isn't her fault. But I definitely don't feel like I owe her anything. It's not that I'm angry at her, just frustrated that she thinks I have any obligation to her.", "You're right. They blew it. But they'll be claiming they're the victims until the end of time. It is what it is, I guess.", "Completely understand this.", "It sounds like they are just pissed you're in the picture. Which is backwards, a good parent wants their child to see both parents. I'd tell him firmly in writing that you need honesty and a clear open form of communication. Then anytime he gets dramatic point to it. They'll probably still be dramatic but if they ever try to take you to court you're covered."]}
