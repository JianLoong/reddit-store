Was there any reason why you couldn't just leave your son with his father and pick him up after the party?", "ESH. There seems to be a lot of conflict and drama in these relationships you've described. Maybe the circumstances of the divorce were such that you have reasons for being hostile. But even if you do, you're supposed to do what's best for your SON. He wanted to go to his sister's party. You could have left him with his father and gone home.

You have a horrible co parenting relationship.", "ESH. I don't support lying to get your way, especially when the excuse of it is something as superficial and passive aggressive as \"putting yourself together\". But your son obviously wanted to go, and while I don't know how much gas you actually had to waste, you could have taken your son to a park for a little bit before the party and driven back, or you could have wasted some time at a store while your son was at the party. You could have even just stayed in the house and hung out with your son while your waited for the guests. It was only an hour and a half.\n\nThings that didn't matter in the outcome of your story: the entitlement of demanding your son be present for an event on your week. You asked your son, he said he wanted to go, you didn't have to accommodate this, but you did. You then arrive 30 minutes later than when they told you the party was going to start, so it's not like you're doing your best not to make waves either.

You both need to learn to coparent better.", "NTA\n\nThey weren't honest with you. Your Ex could have called you to tell you about the new pregnancy. They didn't need to trick you ahead of time. It was kind of you to show up with your child on your own parenting time. \n\nNext time you speak with them let them know they need to be honest with you or you will never be flexible with your own parenting time again. If you don't make a clear boundary they will do this more especially if they're making more children. They'll want to do more family parties, more vacations when it may be on your time. It would be nice if you could both be flexible with each other - but honesty and open communication is key here. They have to play ball too for it to work.\n\nGood luck OP.

But your kid wanted to go to the party, so it was wrong of you to remove him. The gas excuse is a lame one and you know it. If you didn't want to hang out there you could have just left the kid and gone to the park by yourself for a few hours, then come back to get him.", "NTA, but this was not best for your son.  Hopefully, in future, you can dig deeper and put his  needs first even when your ex behaves badly.\n\nFor now, this was harmless, but it won't always be so.", "So wait your ex intentionally kept the actual time from you so you would show up early. And all that just so he can tell you about the pregnancy in person and give you time to \"put yourself together\" afterwards as if it's some lifeshattering news to you?\nHell no NTA. He really seems to love drama. I would like to know what kinda reaction they wanted. You sobbing on the floor while they can be the bigger person and comfort you? And later they will tell everyone how hard it hit you and how nice they are for being there for you?\n\nWhatever weird kinda dream they had about this obv did not work.

It would be bad for OP to just drop him off during her time. If her ex is vindictive. Considering he expected her to fall apart and need time to collect herself finding out the new wife is prego. Yeah.\n\n But OP you knew that your son wanted to go to the party. You should have said Kay bye see you at two. You just invited them to trash talk you to your son. Parental alienation is very hard to prove so it's only going to create a toxic co parenting relationship.", "I doubt he legitimately thought I would be upset, he just lives for drama.\n\nHe was, but no longer is, because we are divorced and they are married now. So that's the past.\n\nShe is my son's half sister through my ex.", "i knew it, i knew she must have been an AP.

The other parent can then claim they have custody more than 50% of the time and take you back to court. It's devious and underhanded, but so is my ex.", "Because it was my week, so he has to be with me.\n\nI wasn't angry about the party. I was frustrated by how entitled she was about the situation. If she had said \"would you mind bringing (son) to my daughter's birthday party?\" I would have said I'll ask him and if he wants to go I will bring him (which is what I did). But by saying \"my daughter's birthday is during your week do you want to bring him over the day of or night before?\" she implied I had no choice. Her daughter's birthday doesn't impact the custody agreement. She needs to ask for things, not demand them.", "Yeah, it does have to be one or the other. If you have split custody it's a very bad idea to ever leave your kid with the other parent on your time. My lawyer told me not to do that and to tell him if my ex ever leave our son with me on his week.", "Birthday parties rarely start on the dot. Every birthday party I've been to has had about an hour of socializing in the beginning as people arrive, get stuff put away, etc... I didn't want to be the first one there. I wanted to make sure there were other people there so my ex couldn't try to talk to me.", "definitely, there is way more to this story. She also reads like a difficult person. I wonder if new wife was an AP though. that would make the attitude make more sense. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t you want to co parent nicely ?", "Ah, but if he was honest with me, he wouldn't have gotten his soap opera moment. He is, after all, the main character of life and we are all just supporting players in his story. /S\n\nJokes aside, you're right, but that's never going to happen. He's allergic to honesty. The only reason I didn't suspect trickery was because his wife made the request, not him, but I guess he's rubbed off on her.", "I'm sure that was his fantasy. He's always preferred fantasy to reality. I thought it was romantic when I was young and stupid. Unfortunately, I too was made of flesh and bone. So he tired of me quickly. But it's fine. He gave me a gift I'd never return. I won't begrudge him the pain. It thickened my skin, at least.", "I may be aggravating to some for saying this. You are going to have to have a \u201crelationship \u201c with this person and his wife and the child for years to come, BUT, I personally find permitting people to cause drama in my life, is my business. If they want a drama ridden life,(and it won\u2019t change), their business. You set boundaries and maintain them.

It's his choice.", "That's exactly what it is. They can have drama for themselves if they want drama, but I'm not playing their games. You lie to me? I leave. You want something from me? Ask nicely and be upfront. If you can't do that, not my problem.", "I don't know for 100% certainty that she knew he was married when the affair started. So I don't blame her for the affair. Even if she did know, she's not the one who made a vow to me, so it still isn't her fault. But I definitely don't feel like I owe her anything.

Now fix yourself before your six year old starts to see it more clearly, because I guarantee you, he sees it now.  \n\n\n  \nBut SOLELY based on the fact that they told you the party was at 12, and you intentionally showed up a half hour late, YTA.", "OP sounds like hard work and I think the other adults are constantly trying to mitigate their responses. The wife wanted the son at the party, which he also wanted to go to, and she gave OP two options to get him there, but apparently that made her entitled because OP \"didn't have to do anything\" - I get the impression getting OP to do anything is an effort. They told OP a time two hours early, OP turned up half an hour late. I expect they were desperately trying to avoid OP kicking up a stink in the middle of the party. My ex said he needed to talk to me, I told him that wasn't necessary? I guess he should have just said okay and let her draw her own conclusions when she saw his visibly pregnant wife. OP couldn't cope with being around but rather than leave the son there, let him enjoy himself and make arrangements for son to spend an extra day with OP to make up for it, OP takes her son and storms out then flat out lies to him to pretend that he's not missing a party because she had a hissy fit. I don't know what reward she expected ex and Mrs to be getting from their lies and trickery - the pleasure of her company for an hour and a half? But then bending the truth, yes, technically there was a mixup with the time but son did not miss the party and is ex now expected to arrange another celebration?

The fact that you said they sounded entitled makes me think that you just don\u2019t value the time your son spends with his ex\u2019s new family. Similarly with you saying the sister is only 1 - this would mean that your son is the one with most memories of the event so he is the one being penalised for this dispute.\n\n2) considering you arrived half an hour late to the assigned time, I would imagine the family has good reason to give you an earlier time. Plus, it makes sense to involve the family (your son) in the preparations, you don\u2019t have to hang out with them. \n\n3) the claim that your lawyer said it\u2019s bad for you to switch time in the custody arrangements is obviously one to do with context.

You were only given two options? Well it wasn't about you princess it was about the child you created who is a living human being you're supposed to be developing with emotional maturity.

It\u2019s also irritating that they planned a birthday party during your custody time without running it by you first to make sure you didn\u2019t already have plans. Since you were already being the bigger person and bringing your son, they shouldn\u2019t have been playing games with you. If they have a pregnancy announcement they can send it to you in an email or text. The theatrics are insulting and unnecessary. They also suck for having the affair partner call you about a custody matter in the first place. Your ex should have been the one to do that.
