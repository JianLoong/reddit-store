Your mom should be able to make a buck, or help out a friend, or whatever, even if it inconveniences you. Can you just go to the library or the park or whatever?

My family keeps saying their gonna celebrate it than no, than yes. So Im not even sure what is going on, so I just wanna chill on my birthday and get ready incase they pull what they did last year", "My mom can hardly do anything on her own, so it would land on me. I know I don't expect eveyone to do my bidding but she hardly makes time for me. I just would like her comfort. She can hardly get down stairs, etc, she can hardly parent her current kids. So the babysitting would land on me. And she hasnt celebrated my birthday in  5-4 years when she can give my brothers big parties and etc", "Ya, and Im not even sure if we are still celebrating it the day after.  Idk, I understand that the world doesnt go around me but I dont wanna deal with 10 kids over, bc, If the other kids find out the kids she might babysit will be over, they will come over", "Imho You are 100% right, if you were talking about a adult.\n\nOP is only to become 16 , has not had any birthdayparty in the last couple of years.\nHer mother decided to make a promis last year as she was forgotten about and even left out of the fun thing on her special day.\n\nYou are right that not the whole world needs to stop just for a birthday however the few people that she speaks about should make the day about her.", "You can\u2019t treat the same kids in a family differently.  Either the parents do it for all of them, or do it for none of them.  That\u2019s some shitty parenting.", "You mom is a huge asshole to do for your brothers and not for you.", "Yeah, the world doesn't revolve around anyone, but your mom is the one who took this unpaid job, so the kids are HER responsibility, not yours.  \nYou should not be expected to babysit almost a dozen energetic kids; that is extremely physically and emotionally draining, *especially* for a minor who didn't even agree to this. It's literally your birthday and all you want is a chill day, yet you're being neglected YET AGAIN after your family promised to change. \n\nI am worried for you, OP, please try to talk this over with your parents or leave the house and come back after the kids are gone. I hope your birthday goes better this time; I wish you the best!", "I disagree, they said they would celebrate on a different day, they can wish her happy birthday on the day, if she wants to be left alone that is fine, spend the day on your room or somewhere else, but to expect to be able to dictate who can and cannot come into your parent\u2019s house, unrealistic.", "What does that have to do with the mom babysitting?\n\nYes, you should treat kids equally, no argument there; however, the issue is not wanting the mom to babysit on her birthday. Again, kids don\u2019t get to dictate who comes into their parent\u2019s house just because it\u2019s there birthday.", "The problem isn't the kids coming into the house, it's the fact that OP will have to babysit these kids when it's *the mom that's supposed to be babysitting*. Also, it's unpaid. I'd understand the mom a bit more for babysitting if it was paid and needed extra cash, but there's no money involved. So there was not an ounce of consideration for OP. OP already has to process so much past trauma on top of that, so imagine babysitting a dozen kids on her own on top of that all on her birthday.   \nThe mom is taking jobs and just dumping them on the OP because the mom can't actually do them herself because of her state.", "Especially if mother is getting paid.", "Ya, thats IF they try this year, they said the same thing last year never did, And these kids ttend to bully my younger brother so it wouldnt be fun to deal with and the babysitting would land on me bc of my mothers state", "Mom won\u2019t actually be doing the babysitting, op will.  That\u2019s what op has said in comments.  That mom volunteers for babysitting and then passes it to op.  That\u2019s a crappy thing to do on the kids birthday.  It\u2019s also a crappy thing to do in general.  Don\u2019t volunteer to babysit and then make your kid do it.  \n\nBut it is shitty parenting to have been doing things for the other kids birthdays but not hers, as has happened multiple times.  That IS shitty parenting.  Expecting to get the same as the other kids in the house from your parent (mom) isn\u2019t asking to have your every whim catered to.  It\u2019s just bare bones fairness.", "nope, she isnt. Just asked, me and her are gonna talk about it whenever. I personality would understand more if she was getting paided but shes not."]}
