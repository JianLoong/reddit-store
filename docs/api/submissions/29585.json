With having a new baby I\u2019m extra cautious about germs and cleaning. This got me thinking about my husbands shower routine. \n\nHe will take a shower in the morning and go off to work (he\u2019s a chemist so mostly desk job but sometimes he walks outside from one building to the next. They are less than a block away). We live in humid hot Florida so that adds to the equation some inevitable perspiration. He\u2019s also a manager so he deals with people all day long. \n\nI have tried to bring up the subject of him taking a quick shower when he gets home from work or even just before bed. He says that he does not need to take another shower since he showered in the morning. I try to explain that I don\u2019t feel comfortable with him laying in the bed because I lay our baby there sometimes and I feel like the bedsheets are dirty by him laying on them, same with our comforter (note: baby sleeps in a bassinet safely next to me but during the day I will lay him in the bed while I do chores around him like folding laundry, etc.).\n\nI realize everybody has their own routines but I have washed my hair in the morning, showered and gone through the day. At the end of it I\u2019m feeling dirty, grimy and in NEED of a shower before bed. How can he be okay with having gone through the whole day and not feel like he should shower? I finally told him I\u2019m not comfortable with him laying in bed dirty so he should sleep in the guest room. \n\nI have OCPD so it\u2019s really hard for me to not have things be the way I feel they should be in my mind. In my mind it\u2019s disgusting for him to lay in bed dirty but what do you guys think? AITA?\n\nEdit: Ok, ITA. I am in therapy with a licensed psychologist and have regular appointments with my psychiatrist which diagnosed me with OCPD (earlier typo, sorry!) and generalized anxiety so the shoe does fit. I apologized to my husband who was understanding of my anxiety to overprotect our baby. He accepted my apology and he\u2019ll be sleeping next to me tonight having only showered this morning \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I\u2019ll talk to my therapist about this tomorrow at our appointment.

That's it.\n\nIn fact, being over protective of newborns in terms of cleanliness and germs is a big cause of allergies. Our immune system is actually primed by encountering things in our environment. Subtract too many of them, and you increase the chances of allergies.\n\nYour husband is not disgusting.\n\nYou are not managing your mental health and you are unfairly taking it out on him.", "This may be unpopular, but YTA.  He has a desk job, he isn't digging ditches for a living and you demanding that he either shower for the second time in a day when he doesn't feel like he needs it, or sleep in the guestroom is unreasonable.  If you're uncomfortable laying your baby down on the bed, then first throw a clean blanket down or put the baby in their bassinet.   You need to loosen up, for everyone's sake.  It sounds a bit controlling and over the top.", "Gentle YTA. I think you're overreacting to how \"dirty\" he is. If he's only going to and from work and not doing manual labor I don't see how he can be \"dirty\" unless he fell on the ground or someone spilled a drink on him. Seems it would be smarter to not have the baby in the bed.\n\nIf you're too overcautious about germs, that can actually be bad for a child. Nor do you necessarily have to shower/bathe every day. And doing so more than once a day can be bad for you. From WebMD:\n\nWhat Happens When You Shower Too Much?\n\nNormal skin has a protective layer of oil and a balance of \u201cgood\u201d bacteria that help protect your skin from dryness and germs. If you clean it too often, especially with harsh soaps and lots of scrubbing, you can strip away this layer, leading to dry, irritated, itchy skin. This can cause cracks in the skin that allow germs and allergens to get through resulting in skin infections or allergic reactions.  \nIn addition, your body\u2019s immune system needs some stimulation from germs, including those that live on your skin. If you scrub them away too quickly, your body doesn\u2019t have a chance to produce the antibodies that protect against them.  \nAntibacterial soaps can actually add to this by killing off the natural bacterial protection against more infectious germs on the skin that are harder to treat. This can make an even bigger difference in kids as their bodies develop. That\u2019s why some pediatricians and skin doctors recommend against bathing children every day.", "Gently, have you discussed the possibility that you are experiencing post-partum anxiety with your healthcare practitioner?", "Hi\u2014\n\nPostpartum OCD is a thing. And if you had OCD before the baby was born, being postpartum can trigger an increase in symptoms. I would recommend you talk to a psychiatrist or therapist about increasing treatment. It\u2019s really important to get this under control before your child is old enough to really be affected.", "Taking multiple showers a day is bad for your skin. If the guy is smelly and dirty, that\u2019s a different story. As for your baby, they\u2019re going to be surrounded by germs every day, all the time. As someone who had a shit immune system when I started kindergarten because I hadn\u2019t built up any immunity (mom was a bit too careful exposing me to actual people besides immediate family), I\u2019d recommend relaxing a bit. I was sick pretty much constantly when I was a kid because of this.\n\nI have a bunch of kids who actually had friends and exposure to people when they were little, and they have strong immune systems and don\u2019t get sick. Germs are not 100% avoidable.\n\nCame back to say, if you meant to type \u201cOCD\u201d, I suffered with it for years. You need to chill and get help if you need it because this isn\u2019t healthy for your children. They\u2019ll pick up on your anxiety and develop dysfunctional habits.", "Yes, YTA but I\u2019m going to go soft on this.   I\u2019m not licensed in anything except food safety but I can recognize misplaced anxiety and fear a mile away.  I know it because I used to live it.  I think it\u2019s time to look within because it may be that your anxiety is starting to affect your personal life.  As a new mom I get it.  My son is 17 but I still remember his first year. Again, I\u2019m not a therapist but maybe ask yourself where this may be coming from and if it\u2019s too much for you to process on your own please find a counselor.  It helped me understand how I can\u2019t control anyone in my life under the guise of my own anxiety.  I learned my triggers and how to manage them in a healthy manner.  If I\u2019m wrong, allow me to apologize.  I too, lived in Florida so I understand the 2 shower a day thing however it doesn\u2019t sound like he needs one given his working environment. He\u2019s not seemingly a dirty guy I don\u2019t think you have anything to actually worry about.  The baby will be fine.", "YTA daily shower is more than enough as long as he\u2019s not sleeping in his day clothes. Are you in therapy? You can\u2019t force your beliefs on your husband, and you need help to work through this irrational compulsion for him to shower twice a day.", "not the asshole.", "INFO:\n\nIf he showered at night, would that solve the issue? Or is two showers a day the only solution you'll accept?", "YTA\n\nYou're imposing your personal feelings about how often you like to shower on him. Once a day is plenty as long as he's comfy and not visibly dirty.", "YTA - as you put it, you have OPD so it's really hard for you to not have things be the way you feel they should be in your mind. Your husband works in an office, periodically has to walk outdoors, and otherwise is a human being at what sounds to be a relatively sedentary white collar job. Unless he's hitting the gym or doing physical labor, getting actually dirty, taking multiple showers per day will dry out his skin and hair, which will cause completely new problems for you both to deal with.", "NTA. My ex perspired more than he thought and refused to shower at night. I take pride in my clean sheets and he would just ruin them every single night. You\u2019re bringing the entire day into bed with you. People who are calling you an AH are probably dirty too.", "NTA. That\u2019s gross, Florida is too hot. To each their own but maybe he should consider just taking a shower.", "Im assuming so if im wrong correct me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.  this is your husband and this is your 2nd child.  So unless you husband magically swicthed his routine in the last 4 months you should now after I assume years of marriage and already having a child saying I need you to now change......for no other reason but your feelings.", "These responses are really alarming to me.\n\nNTA, I\u2019m with you OP - my boyfriend used to do the same thing as your husband but I find it so gross to go to bed at the end of the day with all the germs you carried from out and about. Now, he only showers once a day - and that is right before bed!", "NTA. Why would you want to spread \u201coutside\u201d all around your home? Disgusting \ud83e\udd22", "NTA. Not showering before getting into bed is gross.", "NTA.\n\nI think showering in the morning is redundant. You're going to get dirty, sweaty, and other people's germs on you throughout the day.\n\nPlus, sex is sooooo much better when the person is freshly showered just before bed. When my gf gets out of the shower she already knows what I'm thinking.", "NTA\nIt's disgusting to sleep with someone who left the house and didn't have a shower when return, specially after if he spent all day at work. \n\nI'm pretty sure everyone who says YTA are from United States or Europe.\n\nHere in Brazil and on the rest of Latin America, your husband is the asshole, for sure.", "NTA lol I'm laughing at all the people in the comments that don't practice basic hygiene. If he only wants to shower once a day, do it at night and WASH THE ENTIRE GROSS DAY, off of you before getting into bed. That's just so nasty. But also, is this something he just started doing or has he always been doing this?", "NTA and I can not believe how many people are saying otherwise!!! Wtf!! Maybe these people don\u2019t live in humid climates but it is gross to be out all day and not at least take a 3 minute soap and rinse before bed. Much less with a baby to be on the the bed and cuddled with. \n\nThis is not OCD, this is not anything but him cleaning his swamp ass before he gets in bed. \n\nMaybe he can change his bathing routine to the evenings and that can help, but good lord OP, you are most certainly NTA. \n\nAnd also- you\u2019re the mom, you\u2019re uncomfortable, and again- this is not an unreasonable request!!!!!", "What about showering before bed only? I did that my whole life and I really like the feeling of going to bed right after showering. But I don\u2018t think it is necessary to shower again in the morning. Maybe this is an option you both could consider.", "Fuck, you people are disgusting. Come home from work, take a damn shower ffs. Bringing in all that shit from outside into the bed you share with your spouse and baby...god. NTA.", "NTA\n\nAs a Brazilian, I really don't understand why is so horrible about taking more than one shower a day. Are you guys okay?\nThey live at a humid place, so they probably sweat a lot. Do you guys sleep sweaty to save water or something?", "NTA. What y'all are smoking honestly? She's 100% in the right in terms of hygiene. How can you not shower when you're back at home after 10 hours of commute, work and sweat? Doesn't matter if he's showering in the morning - you're bringing all the mess into your house. Even thinking about going to bed like that is making me feel \ud83e\udd22. It's ridiculous.", "I mean clearly YTA, expecting someone to take two showers a day because you\u2019re obsessive over germs is rude", "NTA I wholeheartedly agree with you, op", "NTA\n  \n  \nI feel like all the YTAs are overlooking that you live in Florida.  I live in Central Texas which is also hot & humid & if you step outside your house\u2026you need a 2nd shower.  There\u2019s just no way to not be sweating at least a little.", "NTA\n\nSurely it would just help things if he showered at night instead of the morning. It\u2019s such a simple thing", "YTA: You\u2019re really gonna ask your husband who works a desk job to shower twice a day because you have some weird fixation about germs? \n\nNewsflash for you. Germs are everywhere. And you\u2019re not doing your child some kind of favor by being a clean freak. Your kid won\u2019t die because there\u2019s germs in the house. Get it together.", "INFO: Were you like this with the first baby also or just now with this new baby?", "NTA. Yes, your OCD is fucking with you. That happens when you\u2019re postpartum. But your husband chose to have a baby with a woman who he knew already had OCD. That means he signed up for this. And rinsing off before bed to give you peace of mind is a pretty small ask after you pushed a human being out of your vagina", "Only Floridians will really understand how grimy you can get after walking around in that humidity. While I think your delivery needs work I also don't understand why your husband is so averse to a quick rinse that would take 5m and do a lot to alleviate hygiene concerns for your infant. For what it's worth, I don't think this is entirely your OCPD. You have an infant, and we're in an as-yet-ongoing pandemic. \n\nHalf the job of keeping a baby healthy for a new parent? Laundry, and hygiene. Half the people responding to you are men who have probably not had to deal with either of these things. Husband should be at least willing to entertain an increased level of hygiene to keep you comfortable, but if he doesn't - *you* should be the one sleeping elsewhere, just because it's about your comfort level personally so kicking someone out of bed over their own willingness to bathe is a bit over the line.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s comical that some think you have OCD because you want a clean bed for your baby. He\u2019s a chemist working with who knows what and around multiple people during cold and flu season. Then he comes home and I bet hugs and kisses all over your new baby. Tell him start showering at night instead of mornings. I wouldn\u2019t want my kid sharing a bed with him either .", "NTA. If he's gross enough to need a shower in the morning, he's gross enough to need one the night before. The thing making him dirty (as we all get) is the work during the day. Why does he clean himself up for coworkers, but not his post-partum, anxiety-ridden wife?   \n\n\nHe sucks. She's fine. Everyone on this forum just hates women.", "YTA.

This is a you problem that you're going to have to find a solution for, and telling him to sleep in a different bed isn't it.", "YTA.  He showers once a day.  Some people shower twice, but that's unusual.  Once per day is just fine.  But wow, did you really call him disgusting?  That's horrible.  YTA, definitely.", "NTA. I've been trying to convince my boyfriend of the same exact thing. He showers in the morning before work - but he works in a restaurant kitchen and just comes home smelling nasty and doesn't shower.\n\nIt's not only affected our mattress and sheets/laundry, but he smells and Ive lost attraction to him. \n\nWhy wash off your stink before you go out to stink? I don't get it.", "Nope nope nope.  Anyone who says YTA has never lived in Florida. I was shower 2 times a day anytime I stepped outside for more than a couple hours", "NTA because I understand you. My husband is the same as you. We live in a humid environment. I had never lived someplace so humid before so I never needed to shower as often. Now I shower twice a day, I picked it up from him but also because of the humidity. I think if you live someplace really humid, you should shower before bed. It is gross.", "Stunned at some of the replies, must be from people in non humid cities. \n\nI work in an office in a hot / humid city, similar to Florida where OP lives. 5-10 mins outside in non air con environment would lead to substantial sweating. I can't imagine not showering after that, apart from bacteria, I would smell and feel gross. I don't know anyone who doesn't shower before they sleep (not a regular conversation topic admittedly!)\n\nWhy can't your husband shower at night instead of the morning, if he insists on one shower a day? \n\nNTA.", "As a Brazilian who showers at least twice a day if not more, the comments in this post are horrifying.", "YTA.

This sounds more like a problem that you have to work through and figure out, not him.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s totally normal to shower just once a day and can have negative affects on skin and hair to shower more often.

What do you guys mean you only shower once and it's in the morning? \ud83d\ude30 Over here if you only shower once you'd get called stinky.\n\nI think OP is NTA but I might be biased because of cultural differences. OP if your husband insists showering once is enough, maybe suggest he showers at night instead of in the morning as a compromise?", "YTA\n\nInstead of telling him to sleep in another room, why don't you suggest he shower at night instead of in the morning.\n\nBut he is right, once a day is plenty for a desk job.  I shower at night mostly, because I like to have a clean body in my bed, but I don't shower again the next morning.  The only time I shower more than once is when I work on the farm, but even then, I usually only get the one shower. I just don't go back on the farm after my shower.\n\nWhat is OPD? I tried to Google it, but it didn't come up with anything.", "NTA.  People saying that two showers a day, in Florida, is too much are world class idiots.

Office job or not you\u2019re going to be sweaty and gross.", "I'm a super unpopular opinion here I guess but I'm also disgusted by the idea of sharing a bed with someone who hasn't showered.

Maybe he can start showering at night instead?", "NTA. I used to shower in the a.m. but somewhere along the line, I believe with the help of a friendly partner, I realized that if I shower at night, the sheets don\u2019t get dirty and if I want to get cozy with someone, it\u2019s just nicer", "NTA.

And he's not wearing his work clothes to bed?   Yeah, he doesn't need to shower twice a day.", "YTA. Calling your spouse disgusting is disgusting.

The guy takes a shower a day and is t working the trades.

I actually believe really strongly that constant hand washing actually increases the bad bacteria on your hands (there's also a number of studies showing this as well). \n\nHaving said that, your husband sounds gross. Living in humid climates pretty much guarantees you won't be fresh only showering once a day. Then there's the fact that he is a chemist. Babies are much more susceptible to trace amounts of various things then adults or even children are and it's completely reasonable that he should be rinsing off after he gets home.\n\nNot to mention that it sounds like you expressed how uncomfortable it makes you and yet he still refuses.
