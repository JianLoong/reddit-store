From what you have said of your brother, if he were alive and your sister had asked him, he would have helped her. Can you put yourself in his shoes and imagine his answer ?", "I\u2019m very sorry for your family\u2019s loss. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US \u2026 Your Mom is the legal heir\u2026 so if she says yes the only recourse you have is to take her to court. \n\nIt appears you are making this situation about something other than Alex. It\u2019s about you & your feelings. Perhaps you need to take a step back & seek some help with this. Grief is a very strong emotion. Getting help to deal with those emotions is very important to finding peace for yourself. \n\nNAH \u2014 but if you continue to push your agenda without concern for your mother or siblings, you will be the ah. You\u2019re not in control here. I think you need to ask yourself what\u2019s your goal? What is the worst that happens here? \n\neta", "YTA. I think her idea is brilliant. Whether it's possible depends on the sperm bank policies and laws, but that's not your problem regardless.\n\nI understand it's weird to you, but try to wrap your head around it. Would Alex like having genetic children raised as his niblings, if he couldn't raise them himself? He cared enough about having genetic children to freeze the sperm in the first place.", "After reading the title, this is better than where I thought it was going to go....\n\nYTA. I think it's a lovely idea and allows her to have a biological connection to the child, she'll be their bio aunt and acting mother.", "NTA. It\u2019s hard to judge but it sounds unbelievably weird and I would be uncomfortable with the idea of another sibling using my dead sister\u2019s frozen eggs to have kids as well. I don\u2019t know anything about the law behind it but social wise if I was the sister I\u2019d ask the closest people on their opinions and if someone was uncomfortable with it I\u2019d drop the idea.", "I just want to add as an aside, please do not take this the wrong way - if your sister is intent on this, and gets access to your brother's genetic material - please, please make sure that the cancer that he had was not the result of a germline mutation - that would mean that all of his cells carry the mutation. \n\nIf possible, do try and get some of the sperm sequenced - the type of mutation would also make a difference. If it is a checkpoint gene, or something involved in an proliferation or apoptotic pathway in the cells, it could lead to a lot of tears.\n\nPlease, whatever the outcome, encourage her to do her due diligence.", "NAH - I am not sure how to navigate this one, though.", "YTA. I think it would be lovely to facilitate a child for your sister and her wife and a child of your brother's.", "YTA, seems like a good idea to me, it solves your sisters problem and your mom would be ecstatic", "Ah man, I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nFirst of all, I'm so sorry for your loss.  Losing a sibling is never easy, and losing a sibling young to cancer has gotta be an extra kick in the gut.\n\nWith regards to this situation specifically, your response to your sister's request is totally valid.  I can see why this situation might feel kinda ghoulish to you.  At the same time, your mom's response is also totally valid.  I can equally see why she might be comforted to know that a piece of Alex might be able to live on in some capacity.\n\nNow that said, my guess would be that control of your brother's material would revert to your mom unless he had a will that directed executorship to someone else.  It is likely that you don't have any sort of say in what happens here, again unless he specifically gave you control, so it probably isn't up to you to, \"let,\" them do this.  Regardless of how you feel about this, your mom's feelings will probably win out.\n\nAs such, I would encourage you to come to terms with this.  It's one thing to have a kneejerk negative reaction, but you have to ask yourself if your immediate distaste is worth severing your relationship with your sister, future niece/nephew, and possible your mom over this.  If it makes you feel any better, it is not at all unusual for lesbians to ask their male blood relatives to help them have have kids in this manner.  If your brother were alive, I'm sure she would ask him.", "YTA why wouldn\u2019t you let your sister do this? It\u2019s a beautiful thing. You\u2019re mother would love it, it would help your sister start her family and all of you would have a beautiful living being to not only love as is, but to know it was a gift given from beyond the grave from your brother. I think it\u2019s a fantastic idea and you\u2019re clearly stuck in some sort of sad grief hole to realize what a beautiful opportunity this is for so many people. \nI hope you can see through the grief of your brother and accept this incredible opportunity to see him live in on in a way other than just your memories.", "YTA ---- If your sister's partner can't use his sperm, 1) who can, 2) why keep it frozen then?", "Would your brother have wanted this? I think that\u2019s really the only moral dilemma here.", "\"not letting\"? HAHA \n\nYTA - you can feel however you want but what a joke to pretend like you have any choice in the matter at all", "YTA Especially since you don\u2019t hold authority over the sperm, and from the information you\u2019ve given this could help heal the family. I understand that your reservation is it feels wrong to have, technically speaking, \u201chis\u201d child, without him. But from the post, it sound like the child will be absolutely loved and cherished once they\u2019re born, so you shouldn\u2019t have shot down the idea so quickly.", ">Alex was the light of everyone\u2019s lives, and I know he always looked forward to being a dad.\n\nSo this is an amazing opportunity for that wish of his to be fulfilled. Of course it's not how anyone would have preferred it, but it's amazing that there is still a way to honor that wish of his. \n\n>Now that he\u2019s dead, it feels so fucking wrong to have children of his on this earth without him here.\n\nWait, what? That's just... That's the opposite of how this sentiment usually goes. You're telling me that if he'd gotten a girlfriend pregnant, you would have wanted her to have an abortion because it would feel 'wrong' to have his kids on earth without him here? What about if a one-night-stand showed up and confessed that she'd had his kid... Would you refuse to have anything to do with the child because it feels wrong?\n\nI'm not going to give a judgement because I understand that grief is complicated, but I encourage you to really think through your emotions on this. Because if your sister and her wife don't use his sperm, then what are you going to do with it? Donate it to a stranger who won't be able to tell the kids anything about the man who gave them life? Destroy it? Because it makes no sense to continue to store something that you will not allow anyone to use", "Soft YTA. Losing a sibling/child is a terrible tragedy so I offer my sympathy to you and your family. \n\nWhile you are all entitled to your feelings, you're speaking on authority when you don't have that authority. Not everyone agrees that it would be weird to have \"children of his on this earth without him here.\" A child born by his sperm wouldn't be his kid, it would be your sister's kid. I don't see how it is different than if she used donor sperm from a stranger. You wouldn't say that child was someone else's would you?", "Nah\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right or wrong answer here. It\u2019s a good idea on paper and I can\u2019t pinpoint anything I find specifically wrong with it. But, in reality, it\u2019s emotionally fraught.", "NAH\n\nThis is a tough subject and everyone's emotions are on edge.  There's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer in this.", "ESH. Since apparently none of you have authority over your late brother's sperm, it wasn't up to you to tell your sister yes or no. She was just sharing her idea I assume, so while your reaction is understandable (and personally I agree with you, I think it's really a terrible idea), you were out of line for the way you expressed yourself. You could've said you were not on board or thought it wasn't a good idea. But \"hell no\" is both rude and authoritative when you have no authority. \n\nJenna, I think, sucks too because she's bringing the subject up to the rest of you without even finding out the legal status of the samples (or if they even exist still, depending on how the sperm bank and the contract for it worked, they may have destroyed them after his passing) and weaponizing the familial bond to get what she wants. Again, without even checking if what she wants is even possible at all and who has to approve it if it is. Particularly I think getting your mother's hopes up this way and tap on her grief to get away with her wishes is sickening. \n\nI think if anyone would know about the legal status of the samples it would be your mother. Assuming Alex wasn't married and hadn't written out a detailed custom will at the time of his passing since he was so young, your mother would've received all the information about his earthy possessions and she would've had to sign papers about everything, from what to do with his remains to what to do with his frozen sperm. If she doesn't know, then it's highly likely that Alex's contract made him the sole person authorized to use them (he did not consent for his samples to be part of an open bank) and for them to be destroyed in the event of his death.", "YTA\n\nWho are you to decide?\n\nHe wanted to have children, and this is the only way he could have them.\n\nEven your mother who is the one who has to decide is thrilled.\n\nYou are mean and nasty!", "NTA, your feelings are valid and so are your family's, everyone grief differently and don't all get torn apart for something that may not even be possible in the end because it all depend on the contrat that your brother signed with the sperm bank. I would suggest that you all talk about it but don't let anyone make the decision alone behind everyone else's back because that would be very seriously wrong.", "NAH. I don\u2019t blame you for not liking the idea of it but I would personally probably allow it and think it\u2019s kind of cool. Who currently is the legal owner of the sperm?", "SOFT YTA I agree it's a really weird situation HOWEVER your mom(and sister and her partner) seemed to you so happy if she(your mom) agrees to it why are you trying to stop it. \nIn a way it's bringing part of him back for your family\n\nAs your mom is legally his (your brother) closest kin and probably has control over his frozen sperm (what a strange sentence to write) she should be the one to make the decision", "NTA. As hard as it is for everyone involved, and my heart goes out to all of you, there is no way Alex can come back. He is gone. Grieve for as long as you need to, honour his memory, and live on. Using his genetic material to help create a child that'll carry his spirit on is a fire-sure way to build up expectations and projections. Yes, this child would be technically his, but it cam turn out to look just like the partner of your sister or even her distant family. I, for that instance, look just like my late great-grandmother on my father's side, nothing like anyone on my mother's side and only very, very slightly like my mother. Personality-wise, we also are very different. So any (hypothetical) hope from my mother that she would like on in me in that sense would be crushed. Don't let your family, inadvertly, make a life of a potential child overloaded with hopes and presumptions.", "NAH. However has anyone looked into if his sperm can legally be used by someone who isn\u2019t him? Using a dead persons DNA source has a lot of legal and ethical implications that vary depending on where you live", "Info: do you think your brother would have donated sperm to your sister if he was still alive? It's not an that uncommon of a thing", "YTA - life is too short to find issues on everyone else decisions. Let your sister find out whether or not is legally possible. You already gave your opinion leave it at that.", "I have no idea on this one.    I'm not touching this with a 10' pole.\n\nBest of  luck.\n\nEdit: And I'm sorry for your loss.", "YTA \n\n\nFirstly is this even legal, who owns (or has power of attorney for) the sperm? \n\n\nAssuming this is something that's legally possible, it sounds like an incredible thing to do. \n\n\nYour brother is dead, you cannot second guess what he would or wouldn't want. \n\n\nYour sister has the opportunity to have a blood connection to her child, rather than explain to her child in the future that their biological father was some stranger who spunked into a cup, she can explain that he was part of the family and teach them about their uncle they never met.", "I'm not judging on this one.  I would however, contact an attorney and find out the legalities of this.", "Yes, YTA for \"not letting\" her do this. It's not about you!\n\nYour feelings are valid, of course. You feel the way you do.\n\nIt's not your decision. It's likely your parents' decision what to do with the sperm, if there's even a possibility (does it still exist, did your brother have a will, without a will likely all his possessions went to his nearest relative per law probably parents).\n\nAfter that, it's entirely your sister and her partner's decision.\n\nYou have the right to an opinion, but you have no right to forbid anything, and you'd be an AH to cut ties--or to force your sister to cut ties with you. (It doesn't sound like she's the one \"throwing a fit\"; she and your mother seem to be reacting to your heavy-handed demands.) Let your sister work it out with your parents, and the non-AH thing would be to be supportive whatever happens (because, again, it's not about you).", "This is very much he's dead he can't use it vs. He's dead he can't consent so this is definitely above reddits pay grade", " I think you might be happier in yourself if you approach this from a different angle, seeking opportunities for joy.", "I honestly have no clue. I'd like to say probably? But again what I think holds me back about this is that I don't know what he wants. If neither of us can assume what he does or doesn't want, since he's been gone for almost a decade, then why does my sister get to do whatever she wants?", "I bet he would!", "I think it might bother me because he froze the sperm with the intent of him using them to have kids later in life. That can't happen, and now he isn't here to consent to what happens with it? It feels almost like going behind his back, I guess.", "INFO the contract your brother signed with the sperm bank authorize that kind of things ?", "Why is *she* so selfish? She's using his property for her own personal uses after his death without his consent. That's my view.", "It's not specified who holds authority over the sperm, in the end the sperm bank might just shut down the idea all together, and threatening to cut all contact and do it behind the family's back is just as bad...", "Was that mean and nasty comment really necessary or are you just projecting now?", "If brother wanted to have children, this is the only way his wish can be honored. \n\nI think there\u2019s still a lot of unresolved pain and trauma over the brothers death, and I\u2019m very sorry about that.", "Not necessarily. He being 18 at the time may play a factor as he would be a legal adult medically.", "same :( I just want to say I am so incredibly sorry to OP. I lost my brother to whom I was very close to last year and I am still devastated :(", "Right? I feel like an ass no matter what I do.", "I don't want to sound mean or anything. But he's dead, and how does her using his sperm harm you in any way?", "i bet he wouldn\u2019t. having a child with your sil? please. out of all donors, why choose the kids uncle.", "Okay and he passed away. You think it's better not to bring his offspring into the world now that because he's dead? That makes less sense than anything. It isn't \"going behind his back \" and you know it. What you're doing is wrong and an overreaction to the point where if I were your sister I would end my relationship with you.", "Is there a specific reason his sperm was kept after he died?", "Of course he can't consent to it and would require that whole family to agree to it for it to be acceptable. Sit down and all communicate on the matter.", "Info - what does it have to do with YOU? Why do you feel like you get a say?", "I think I would err on just making your opinion known and then backing off. If they choose to pursue this, and are legally able to use his sperm, you\u2019ll most likely \u201cget over it\u201d once the baby is born and becomes a real person instead of just concept.", "It\u2019s incredibly common, actually.", "Hmm. I'm open to changing my stance, hence why I posted asking for advice, but I still just feel like this is a ludicrous idea. Alex loved kids and wanted to be a dad one day, we were only a year apart so we were very close and talked a lot about our futures. I almost can't help but feel like he'd be sad that his kids are here and he can't take care of them? I don't necessarily believe in a higher being and I know he probably wouldn't know about all this (since he's dead), but if he is, maybe, somehow \"looking down on us\" I feel like his feelings would be hurt. Maybe that's stupid, but that's my gut reaction.", "I actually have no idea, that's a very good question. I was 19 when he passed and my parents handled everything medical and legal with his death. I should probably ask my mother and make sure the sperm actually is still there before we continue to fight over all this", "OP has communicated her position very clearly - although I don't know why she she feels she has to give permission, because it's nothing to do with her unless she has rights to control over brother's sperm.", ">and are legally able to use his sperm\n\nAnd that's a huge if, as he never gave that specific consent before his passing.", "I'll chime in here. Jenna is 23, and she was 14 when Alex died. They were not close and they fought often. I think it just bothers me because she doesn't seem like she's doing it to honor his memory, it seems like she's doing it because it's convenient and she won't have to find a decent sperm donor. She has never been *overly* sentimental about Alex, not in the way my mother and I were.", "before moraly nobody should be able to make that decision, it's just wrong and immoral, that's why it takes the whole family not just the sister who, I remind you, have the exact same status in this family. Unless the will or contract with the sperm bank says otherwise of course."]}
