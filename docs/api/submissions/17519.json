But basically housing a boy that one daughter is dating while the other has a crush on him. \n\nWhy would you invite all that drama into your house??", "what did he so easily do? he easily recognized what the mother didn\u2019t.", "OP obviously isn't going to provide every little piece of context that went into his decision making, but in his opinion it's totally obvious Mary and Eve are fighting over the same boy, he even states it in the post, poorly, to his wife.\n\nThe commenter you're replying to is saying \"it's unusual the wife was oblivious to that\". Usually the mom is more clued up on their teenage daughter's behaviour than dads are (n.b. *usually*, not always)\n\nThat's it.", "What a weird interpretation that nobody else is thinking but you.", "I can see how Mary might've taken that interpretation from what OP said, but I don't think that's what OP actually meant", "It's actually not okay to tell your partner they are an idiot. You can point out how they are wrong, but if you think name-calling is okay, you're an AH.", "The people on this sub are some really pathetic and from the looks of it , very lonely and socially awkward adults.\n\nYou are repeatedly jumping to conclusions that are clearly wrong. In no way did he imply that she had to wait. He just stated a fact , that highschool relationships rarely last. \n\nIf he was implying something , it was more that a highschool relationship was not worth fighting or cheating over.\n\nI see you trying so hard to twist words and add false meanings , that it makes me wonder if 90% of this sub is not just delusional teenagers or some very sad and pathetic adults", "I think \u201cprank\u201d and \u201cjoke\u201d are the most overused excuses for AH behavior in this sub.", "You're so edgy, please bless me with your genes", "I know redditors are not known for their real life experiences but stfu.

My father has never read a book in his life, he left school at 14 without ever taking a single exam.

He built a staircase leading up to a deck, every tread and rise were the exact same height and he did it without using a protractor or calculator, just a tape measure.
