Maybe she said it in a way that wasn't accusatory but mentioning it but you immediately jumped to her giving him attitude. Ewh. Anyway, one should know the relationship enough to know whether this tongue in cheek comment would be hurtful. If he doesn't play with his wife like that he definitely should apologize.

The lesson here should not be that it's fine because she'll have no reason to be jealous and petty soon, the lesson should be not to act jealous and petty at all.
