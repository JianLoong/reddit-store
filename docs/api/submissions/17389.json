Your feet were clean when you put them on and I assume you clean your floors occasionally. If the bottom of the socks hasn't become noticeably dirty in those few hours (and you don't have dogs or cats shedding hair everywhere) you're all good.\n\nThat being said, I do wonder why you don't just get some slippers lol", "Yeah we have set sides and set pillows. Faces are nasty af and so are beards, I don\u2019t want that and I definitely don\u2019t want to sleep with my face in my guys dried dribble patches between wash days lmao", "Its about their actions and not them. If i tell you your decision or something was dumb im not calling you dumb, im calling your actions dumb. If i tell you your decision was dangerous im not calling you dangerous, im calling your actions Dangerous. Thats a difference", "I agree. I love putting lotion and fuzzy socks on before bed. A good portion of my laundry every week is socks because I won\u2019t wear them twice.", "Oh but I do use slippers, just on top of the socks", "Ah, disregard my comment above. I see you have slippers!"]}
