No one can pretend. I said her parents might have taught her : but she could have seen a friend does this, or she could have a past boyfriend doing this, or she could have started this habit out of nowhere, who knows.\n\n**But the fact remain : there is not a single relationship conflict in a healthy relationship that is solved by personnally attacking your SO.

My gf is mostly work from home, so it is not just going out of the shower with washed feet and do some stuff before the bed time.

The socks go under the pillow when she leaves for some outdoor activity and. She 100% has at least some sweat after going around the house in them and sleeping in them and after squaring and accumulating dirt and sweat and bacteria they go under the warm pillow.

About addressing this - not sure but I can think of some peaceful ways to deal with it", "OP says girlfriend only washes those socks once every week/2 weeks. Do you think that putting on socks that you sweat in then let them marinate under your pillow THEN put them back on your feet after a full day of walking around is going to smell good?", "Oh I wear sleepers on top of the socks to walk around, so the surface cleanliness doesn't really come into play, but you're right there might be some sweat though...", "You didn\u2019t personally attack your SO. Reddit is full of keyboard warriors.", "Even saying something she did is disgusting is hard to hear and almost certainly put her on the defensive. You were correct but that isn\u2019t the best way to solve the problem.", "That's being pedantic.

Maybe you should look up what a personal attack is", ">The rudest was me telling her that this is disgusting and wild.\n\nSure, don't address the fact that OP went straight into attack & shame mode instead of discussing the situation calmly like an adult, and play with words instead.", "What a weird fight you are trying to pick up here... I hope your day get better. Sure seems like the start wasn't good.", "Marinate made me cackle. Valid, she should air them out and wash them more often.

Yes he could of had more tact, but it\u2019s not abusive. Straight facts. Honestly I find it really funny this whole thing. Girlfriend is probably mortified. OP should go buy some funny socks as a little present and talk about it over a nice home cooked meal and make up.", "I don\u2019t wanna fight :( I was just curious", "Everyone is different. I unfortunately have those swamp feet. Very clammy hands and feet. I absolutely cannot re-wear socks. And cannot wear shoes without socks.
