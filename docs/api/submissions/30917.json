{"id": 30917, "submission_id": "17uhtq4", "title": "AITA for telling my aunt to keep her gifts since my kids couldn\u2019t care less about them?", "selftext": "I have two toddler sons. They\u2019re just like any other toddler and are pretty self absorbed. \n\nCurrently, one adores cars and the other loves the color red. Toddler 1 won\u2019t play with anything but cars and toddler 2 will only play with red toys.\n\nMy mom hosted a party the other night and one of my aunts came. She bought a bunch of gifts for all the kids. The older kids were respectful and accepted their gifts, but my sons simply glanced at the toys, noticed they weren\u2019t cars or red, and moved onto something else. I thanked her for the toys and made a joke about how unpredictable toddlers are after realizing that she looked upset but she rolled her eyes and said \u201cthat was rude.\u201d I told her that they\u2019re toddlers and she said \u201cso? My kids knew how to say thank you by the time they were 3.\u201c\n\nI told her that they can say please and thank you, but they\u2019re still learning. \n\nShe made a noise and said \u201clearning to be rude.\u201d I told her she was being a little sensitive and that they\u2019re literally babies. They don\u2019t even understand the concepts of being \u201crude\u201d or \u201cungrateful.\u201d  She got annoyed and said fine then, don\u2019t expect any more presents after today and that she hates entitled parents like me who are blinded by their children and think they can do no wrong. I said whatever, and told her she could keep the gifts she bought for today since my kids couldn\u2019t care less about them. She got all red in the face and said now she knows why the boys are so rude but I just grabbed the kids and my husband and left. \n\nI was extremely angry at the moment but now I\u2019m just in disbelief. Who gets offended by a toddler? My mom says my aunt is very upset with me and is threatening to uninvite us from her Christmas dinner  (aunt is hosting this year) unless I apologize and promise to raise my kids better. My mom thinks we\u2019re being ridiculous and I should just say sorry but I said no. AITA? I just can\u2019t wrap my head around why she\u2019s so angry?\n\nEdit:\n\nFirst, to be more specific, the boys just turned 2. \nSecond, I feel I made this clear, but I apologized and thanked my aunt before anything else. The boys had already run off to their dad and were preoccupied with him by the time I got to my aunt so dragging them over and trying to maybe get a thank you out of them felt like a waste of time for all of us. I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t allowed to feel hurt, but she didn\u2019t have to say all those things about my kids. \n\nI\u2019ve explained this in the comments, people still think I\u2019m in the wrong but a few people are saying to include it anyways. The boys don\u2019t really speak. Yes they\u2019re 2 and I\u2019m sure your 2 year old niece or nephew can speak several languages but my sons barely say mommy and daddy sometimes. It\u2019s not something concerning, but I didn\u2019t think it was worth the time to drag my kids back to me and my aunt and get them to say thank you which they won\u2019t even acknowledge me until about 10 minutes in and then they\u2019ll just stare\u2014sometimes I can get a noise or sound out of them maybe a \u201coo\u201d but I figured my aunt had better things to do than wait that long. I sincerely believe that there was no reason for her to get so angry but I understand that I was wrong and will apologize. We won\u2019t be attending her Christmas party though. \n\nThanks for all the comments, I appreciate the nice ones with constructive criticism.

She was 100% out of line for reacting so seriously to toddlers not having proper manners - of course they don't. And making demands of you as a parent - ie the 'promise to raise your kids better' absolutely takes the cake, insanely presumptuous and self-congratulatory. She should have kept her assessment of your sons or your parenting to herself as it's frankly none of her business. \n\nI do think you responded in a childish way. You should have taken the high road in my opinion, if for no other reason but that you end up clouding the issue.

If they're old enough for \"please\" and \"thank you\" to be part of their vocabulary, then a prompt from you to thank the aunt themselves is appropriate.", "NTA first of all who is offended by the behaviors of a 2 year old? Grow up, seriously. Second of all, it sounds like she is just being petty because she doesn't really know your kids that well. Personally I know just enough about psychology to understand justification versus rationalization, don't get me wrong, I don't think you're 100% right but your Aunt definitely should know better and at least have the self respect to just ignore the situation and let it go. Instead of again, basing life decisions off of the actions of a 2 year old.", "NTA: the kids are so young that to be upset over no getting a thank you is just crazy.

Your boys are 2. They are incapable of being \"rude\" because it's not a concept they can grasp yet. There's a time and place for enforcing/teaching manners. Grabbing 2 toddlers to haul them over to aunty and try to force them to say thankyou when they are already not very verbal.and  its during a party where they're is overwhelming noise and excitement would have been asking for toddler tantrums. Your aunt was the rude one who insulted you and your children and now she's all butthurt you clapped back. I'd tell mom that you have no intention of attending the party until aunty apologizes. Its ironic the 60 year old woman with poor manners and etiquette is expecting toddlers to be more mature than she is.", "I kind of feel like the way that you teach little ones to eventually be gracious and polite is to model it **for** them long before they are capable of doing it themselves.  \n\nWhenever I give a gift to a friend's baby, my friend usually draws their attention to it and loudly and clearly says \"oh thank you Auntie Grizelda!\".  Then the kid is free to ignore me and go back to sucking on its toes or whatever.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is a crazy asshole - you should not allow her to traumatize your kids. Stand your ground.", "Hey...just a question, how are they responding to their names or eye contact? \n\nFor them to not really be talking at 2, like not even babble or \"mommy/daddy\" could potentially be a speech delay.

They already get so many toys from people trying to buy their love and young kids truly do not care about many of these toys.  Plus, the parents live in limited space and don't have the room for tons of toys.  We got the idea from our daughter in law who said that her grandparents had done this same thing for her and that when she went to college, she had a nice little nest egg that she truly appreciated and could use as opposed to just tons of cheap crap that is going to break/get ignored in a few months anyway.

Which is the truth? \n\nIf they're non-verbal, *you needed to say that*. Telling her that the babies CAN say thank you but won't thank HER was pretty much guaranteed to upset her; whether you meant to or not, you conveyed disdain for the gift and the giver. \n\nYTA, I think. If your kids are actually non-verbal, you still need to model gratitude for them. \"What do we say? That's right, 'thank you'! Yay!\" is pretty basic stuff that my family did with literal babies (who clearly couldn't talk) just to get them accustomed to the ritual of gift exchange. You waiting until your twins are 3 or 4 seems like you're unnecessarily making learning harder for them.", "NTA - your aunt sounds like a toddler.

And it has to be done immediately and in  person if the gift was given in  person. Mind you, I've also seen that they don't feel it's as important to thank the many people that help them out day to day. So your aunt comes by this behavior honestly and you have to come up with a strategy of how you plan to  deal with your children & the receipt of gifts.

All you had to do was some parenting: \"hey boys, say thank you to auntie!\"  Even if they just said something incomprehensible in toddler language, it's showing that you care and showing them what's expected.   I doubt your aunt was expecting some eloquent response from 2 year olds.  \n\n\nThat's it!  As u/thirdtryisthecharm stated, it wasn't what the boys did.  It was the lackadaisical \"I don't care about you\" way ***YOU*** reacted.  \n\nOf course, she way overreacted to that but your attitude is what sparked it.", "NTA", "Nta.

NTA for standing up for your kids.", "Everyone else is wrong. You\u2019re not an asshole, you\u2019re not overbearing to your kids (as you would be if you forced them to thank her), and she was the entitled one! She got gifts that your kids wouldn\u2019t like because she didn\u2019t bother to ask you what they would like, and then expected them to perform a \u201cthank you\u201d for her uninvited, lazy attempt at gift giving! Sounds like she\u2019s the type to only give \u201cgifts\u201d with strings attached; expects unrealistic special treatment for a half-assed gift. Can\u2019t ever just be happy to give. She would undoubtedly give your kids an unhealthy understanding of the nature of gift giving.\n\nYou were completely right for not dragging your kids over and going \u201cWhat do we say\u2026?\u201d And trying to force a \u201cthank you\u201d out of them. Because they ran off already when the gifts were presented, your opportunity to show them that \u201cgifts = say thank you\u201d was no longer available.  If you took them back and tried to get them to say \u201cthank you\u201d they wouldn\u2019t understand why because the moment already passed. It would frustrate them, and teach them that if they don\u2019t say thank you they will be pushed to their limit, and then they\u2019ll have a negative emotion associated with what should be a happy, grateful phrase. The proper way to teach kids to say thank you is to LEAD BY EXAMPLE. If you\u2019re saying \u201cthank you\u201d to them every time they give you something or do something nice, and they\u2019re not saying it yet, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re rude! It means they literally are not able to replicate that speech pattern yet! If they\u2019re taught sign language for \u201cthank you\u201d from very early on, leading by example, it\u2019s actually much easier for young toddlers to communicate via sign language than imitate words. They can learn how to sign way faster than they can learn how to talk. Anyway! N T A!

Even as a baby, I would take my kids on my hip and grab their hand and make them pat the person who gave them a gift's arm or hand while I said thank you for them. Then I tapped their chin while they looked at me and slowly enunciated \"Th-Ank You\" for them to see how the words were formed. When they could walk and start talking, I would take them with me and even if they hated the gift, I would make them at least say something. Even if it was close to thank you. my son would shake hands and my daughter would too, unless she was comfortable then she would give hugs. I always told my kids you don't have to like the toys, you don't have to play with them, but you HAVE to say thank you and be gracious. \n\nThis is why...someone thought of my kids. When they selected that toy, my kids were thought of. So, I make sure my kids, no matter their age, thank them personally.

I cannot believe you think your kid saying thank you should be precedented on whether he approves the gift or not, and your attitude of it being a waste of time to even try getting a thank you out of them is appalling.\n\nI actually want to cheer your aunt, because she honestly said what so many of us think when encountering poorly behaved children these days: your kid is being raised poorly, and yes, we're judging you. Also, if you aren't grateful, you don't get anything and my desire to give or do anything for you, ever again, in the future just died.\n\nBut she did escalate more than necessary and in front of a crowd, so while a hero, she's the asshole hero we deserve.", "YTA. \n\nYou were rude, and you are not teaching your kids manners.

It is how, as an adult, i rate the success of the gift for a kid.\n\nAs a parent, I really tried to avoid saying \"what do we sayyy\" (tho I admit I certainly have).

OP, I mean jeeze louise,  I don't think I've every equated the term \"self absorbed\" with a toddler.  I mean... yeah I suppose they are if you are looking at them with a filter of \"I rate all behaviors as if the person is an adult\"... but a freshly made human is trying to figure out how this whole world thing works.  So yeah a lot of the time they are concerned with themselves.  I mean they are still barely figuring out the 'don't bump into stuff' thing.

Aunt should have had the grace to laugh about it and say 'right?' and not give it another thought. An adult calling a 2 year old rude just beggars belief. She needs to get over herself.\n\nHaving said that-OP, surely when she handed the gifts to your kids you could have said 'what do you say to Aunt Jane?' and not let them run off until they'd said thank you. 2 years old isn't too young for that.

Could do more harm than good depending on OPs own parenting examples... like the aunt.", "Yup. \"Please,\" \"thank you,\" and \"more\" are the top three signs for kiddos :) \"Thank you\" is very easy-- it's like blowing a kiss!", "100% my son learnt the sign for please and thank you around 12m and used them consistently- ppl often think he's blowing kisses, but they take that to mean thank you any way \ud83d\ude05", "Yes, thats why mom said thank you. Whats wrong with yall jfc.", "Exactly, the aunt expected them to be forced by their parent to kiss this person's ass who is essentially a stranger to their young minds. I'm glad they didn't like the gift since the aunt apparently expected a puppet show featuring two living human babies.", "I have an aunt like the one in this story, and the whole family has been no contact with her for about 7 years now.", "Yeah but do you see how other parents who have no fucking idea what they are talking about are so quick to call OP an asshole?\n\nLike the user above me jerking themselves off over how they remind their toddlers to say \"Tank you\" like they are the messiah of parents.", "Seriously. My son was barely talking at two, by three he could tell me whole stories about his day.\n\nETA: We've been modeling and practicing manners since he was born and he's still working on saying please and thank you on his own at age 4. Even if I remind him you'll probably just get a distant muttered \"thank you\" when he's in a mood.", "The milestones are developed by when 75% of kids master a skill. While not all kids who aren't in that group need extra support they should always be recieve a developmental check, as if there is a reason they aren't reaching it early intervention is key. \n\nNot all kids develop at the same rate. But children shoeing developmental red flags and not meeting milestones should be offered support. Research shows us this is key to ensuring they are on track later on. \n\nhttps://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au/Public/Public/Comm-swallow/Speech-development/Communication-milestones.aspx", "This is not simply anecdotal evidence from your husband; there have been medical studies on this and good pediatricians now tell parents of multiples not to expect their children to talk as soon as other children because they won't. They will communicate to their twin in what sounds like gibberish to us but is language to them.\n\nOP is NTA. The aunt was expecting a lot from twins who just recently turned 2 y.o. Mom thanked her, that should have been enough.", "My middle 2 (2yo&3yo) are 15 months apart and talk without talking, pretty sure my 5mo is figuring it out with them too, all 3 of them just give each other looks and start giggling, and my 5mo frequently gets excited by their looks and starts gesturing wildly, seems like the toddlers follow along with whatever she's telling them. They're also really good at letting me know what she needs/wants before she makes a sound. My husband, 9yo and I never know what they're communicating", "Hell, my brother and I are 18 mo apart and had our own language.  \nI had a verbal delay due to my specific type of neurodivergency. My brother and I developed our own language and he was my translator. My mom fully admits that she would actively ask my brother what I was saying when she couldn't understand me.  \nExpecting two year old twin toddlers to speak anyone's language or for their parent to be on their case all the time is insanity. Twins are a unit, and they're twice as exhausting as singles. You're constantly negotiating with two mini humans who barely understand that they're not supposed to A) put things in their mouth, B) play with their bodily waste, or C) scream like a banshee if they don't get their way. \"Please\" and \"thank you\" are at the bottom of the priority list.  \nBoth of my parents are twins, and they've said that they couldn't even imagine dealing with multiples after me and my brother. One of us would learn something, then unlearn it just because the other one didn't show an interest in it.", "I was warned by my twins paediatrician that they might be delayed in talking, since twins often communicate just fine with each other, and don\u2019t try with others until much later than average single birth babies. \n\nI tease them both now, (21f/m) saying I wish that had been the case, since I love telling them about the gems they\u2019d randomly blurt out in public. Almost always at my expense.", "This. My partner's a twin. He and his brother can *still* communicate without really using words. They'll have a whole ass conversation and I'll be looking between them like \".... Huh?\"  \n He told me once that their speech was slightly delayed, because they would talk to each other instead of adults.", "I\u2019m 15 months older than my sister and our mum was stymied when I started school because she hadn\u2019t realised how much \u2018translating\u2019 I did\u2026", "I can't believe the people calling the OP the AH. And she's said her kids just turned 2 and are barely verbal. \n\nThe Aunt literally said the kids were rude. Freaking 2 year olds. She's ridiculous and I wouldnt want to attend the old cow's party either.\n\nNTA, OP. The people saying you are have never been around a toddler", "Lol I remember my girls at the 2-3 years. Twins lol. They def can be assholes at that age lol", "My friends\u2019 3 year old nearly dumped a forkful of coke slaw on my head recently. They\u2019re wild and crazy sometimes, I absolutely wouldn\u2019t bat an eye if a kid didn\u2019t react the best to a gift. Honestly, it\u2019d be pretty funny in the moment and wouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings. Kids are weird and unpredictable, and learning how to interact with people.", "My youngest is 2 1/2 and can say thank you. Sometimes without prompting and sometimes with. And because he watched Miss Rachel, he sometimes signs thank you while saying it. He did it a lot during trick-or treat. But yes, freshly minted 2 yr Olds are hard to get talking. Both of mine were in that same boat and are in early intervention for it.", "Damn, commenter, stop punching. The aunt is already dead.", "I work in customer service, so I see a *lot* of people every day - and honestly, especially post-pandemic, I see a lot of parents still trying to work with their kids on saying thank you at age *six* or so. I never judge them. Why would I? At least they're trying to teach their kids.", "I know twins where the one couldn\u2019t hear and the other one could, but also developed a speech problem bc she spoke like her bad hearing twin. So they both had to go to massive speech therapy.", "I thought I remembered something like that from my developmental psych class \ud83d\ude0a It\u2019s just been awhile so I didn\u2019t want to cute a source I wasn\u2019t sure existed.", "As a parent to twins, I can vouch", "Honestly thats adorable. Baby language!", "Apparently I developed my own language as a toddler. My parents said they could understand me, but they never spoke it to me. They also said I stopped using it the day my sister came home from the hospital. Apparently I took one look at the new baby and immediately started pulling my parents around to show them I knew the correct words for things. No new baby was replacing me! I was very disappointed to find out we couldn\u2019t return her, ha!", "What made me laugh was that my sister and I didn\u2019t realize we still did that as adults until we had a whole conversation about a family shit show in front of our cousin. My sister was worried that we might\u2019ve offended him with the level of negativity involved and asked me to apologize just in case. According to our cousin we spent most of the meal looking meaningfully at each other with one or two sentences thrown in. Thankfully he was highly entertained trying to figure out what we were saying. \ud83d\ude05 We were in our twenties when this went down\u2026a decade later and we still catch ourselves communicating silently at random moments\u2026mostly when we get interrupted and the mental sentence gets cut off.", "Thank you! OP said thank you on their  behalf, perfectly normal response.\n\nMaybe they should have got the Aunt to move in with them for a year so they could thank her when they learned how.", "Not even just barely verbal. Some of the things op mentioned seem suggestive of autism. Which makes aunt doubly an ah.", "I agree. I'm shocked with the Y T A votes. My youngest is 4 and is barely getting into the habit of saying thank you on his own. I still have to remind him and even then it's like pulling teeth. If he acts like a dick, which he often does since he's 4, I apologize and thank the person for him. Aunt seems a bit over the top.", "Literally. Like, and anybody who's ever been around kids knows that hey, some just pick things up faster than others, OP apologised either way. Even then, the kids are 2.. 2!! What was up with the aunts comments? So quick to call OP entitled. NTA", "For real.  I was reading this thinking LOL, be glad you don\u2019t have to attend Aunt\u2019s Christmas dinner now! and then I scrolled down to read yta and my brain started malfunctioning.", "Oh I can. Parents will rush to shit on other parents who aren't raising their children \"properly\" while having no fucking clue.\n\nFor example, that user who is bragging about how they always remind *their* kids to say thank you, therefor OP is an asshole.\n\nWe need to break this bad habit of expecting all children to conform like robots and all this performative bs for family. No, aunty is not allowed to just pinch your cheeks and nobody is allowed to demand hugs or for your children's love and affection. Forcing it out of them and their parents is fucking creepy and weird.\n\nYes, it can be a let down when a niece or cousin's kid doesn't show you affection or act the way you want. Nobody *likes* rejection but we can't take it personally like the aunt did here. And to make it into a big thing about Christmas and demanding an apologize and *promise to raise the children better* is beyond the pale.\n\nI think some people are raised to believe children *owe* adults certain behaviors and feelings. It doesn't matter where the child is in development or their feelings, the feelings of the fully brain-developed adult take precedence over recognizing a non-verbal 2 year old can't give you the acknowledgment and thanks an 8 year old can. \n\nKeep in mind just how many people hate children in general, and women. This is a post from a mother with children. Who are most redditors going to identify with? The person without children in the story, or the woman and her babies? Plus you have the opportunity for parents to feel superior because \"I ALWAYS make my toddler say thank you\" like really? .", "No kidding, and for it to be top comment as well. What in the world do people expect of 2 year olds?", "Agreed. NTA.", "So the boys recently turned 2, this leads me to believe that they are twins. Twins won't give 2 shits what the aunt thinks, they're in their own little world. NTA, OP.", "Also, thank you is of course important, however a gift is given from the heart and with the expectation of nothing in return. Demanding toddlers be grateful is ridiculous. I imagine too, if they are twins, they are in their own little twin world where they just communicate with each other. My kids were both early walkers but didn\u2019t talk much until 2 and thereafter. And they were incredibly shy. They wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone or hug them and I wasn\u2019t going to force that. Children also need to learn autonomy earlier and not be force to react the way people demand them to. Probably could sense Auntie is an AH.", "I think it can be worse with twins too. They can communicate with each other so easily without words sometimes that they don\u2019t understand that they need to use words and actions with other people until they\u2019re a bit older, say 3+? Instead you just get the blank stares for 5+ minutes because they *are* communicating but *we* don\u2019t understand. Not to say that intervention wouldn\u2019t be needed mind but I\u2019ve seen this with a few sets of twins now for it to be just a coincidence.", "Oh, that is absolutely adorable \ud83e\udd70 Im gonna keep the image this created in my head in my \"feelgood box\" of adorable stories!", "That's really cute!", "Ummm...that's called--\"telepathy\"", "Honestly that was my impression too, along with the focus on very specific toys, but didn't want to armchair diagnose someone's children. But it makes the \"YTA\" comments even worse, because...come on.", "I thought the same thing! My autistic grandaughter was obsessed with green megablocks when she was 18 months old, long before she was diagnosed as autistic . She\u2019s currently quite keen on things with wheels that she can sit on, even if she is way too big for them (think hot wheels car or Barbie convertible lol)", "My son was a late talker and at 4 was barely able to firm the words \"thank you\" let alone remember to say them every time.", "I couldn't believe it. Some parents can be ridiculously judgy and expect kids to be tiny adults. All because she didn't force her non-verbal twin 2 year olds to put on a performative display of forced gratefulness for the Aunt.\n\nI hope OP has an awesome Christmas dinner with her little ones and no entitled AF extended famiy", "> And to make it into a big thing about Christmas and demanding an apologize and promise to raise the children better is beyond the pale.\n\nI hope OP and her husband throw a bangin Christmas party at their house with their friends, and the boys get the best red cars ever from Santa."]}
