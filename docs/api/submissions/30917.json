{"id": 30917, "submission_id": "17uhtq4", "title": "AITA for telling my aunt to keep her gifts since my kids couldn\u2019t care less about them?", "selftext": "I have two toddler sons. They\u2019re just like any other toddler and are pretty self absorbed. \n\nCurrently, one adores cars and the other loves the color red. Toddler 1 won\u2019t play with anything but cars and toddler 2 will only play with red toys.\n\nMy mom hosted a party the other night and one of my aunts came. She bought a bunch of gifts for all the kids. The older kids were respectful and accepted their gifts, but my sons simply glanced at the toys, noticed they weren\u2019t cars or red, and moved onto something else. I thanked her for the toys and made a joke about how unpredictable toddlers are after realizing that she looked upset but she rolled her eyes and said \u201cthat was rude.\u201d I told her that they\u2019re toddlers and she said \u201cso? My kids knew how to say thank you by the time they were 3.\u201c\n\nI told her that they can say please and thank you, but they\u2019re still learning. \n\nShe made a noise and said \u201clearning to be rude.\u201d I told her she was being a little sensitive and that they\u2019re literally babies. They don\u2019t even understand the concepts of being \u201crude\u201d or \u201cungrateful.\u201d  She got annoyed and said fine then, don\u2019t expect any more presents after today and that she hates entitled parents like me who are blinded by their children and think they can do no wrong. I said whatever, and told her she could keep the gifts she bought for today since my kids couldn\u2019t care less about them. She got all red in the face and said now she knows why the boys are so rude but I just grabbed the kids and my husband and left. \n\nI was extremely angry at the moment but now I\u2019m just in disbelief. Who gets offended by a toddler? My mom says my aunt is very upset with me and is threatening to uninvite us from her Christmas dinner  (aunt is hosting this year) unless I apologize and promise to raise my kids better. My mom thinks we\u2019re being ridiculous and I should just say sorry but I said no. AITA? I just can\u2019t wrap my head around why she\u2019s so angry?\n\nEdit:\n\nFirst, to be more specific, the boys just turned 2. \nSecond, I feel I made this clear, but I apologized and thanked my aunt before anything else. The boys had already run off to their dad and were preoccupied with him by the time I got to my aunt so dragging them over and trying to maybe get a thank you out of them felt like a waste of time for all of us. I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t allowed to feel hurt, but she didn\u2019t have to say all those things about my kids. \n\nI\u2019ve explained this in the comments, people still think I\u2019m in the wrong but a few people are saying to include it anyways. The boys don\u2019t really speak. Yes they\u2019re 2 and I\u2019m sure your 2 year old niece or nephew can speak several languages but my sons barely say mommy and daddy sometimes. It\u2019s not something concerning, but I didn\u2019t think it was worth the time to drag my kids back to me and my aunt and get them to say thank you which they won\u2019t even acknowledge me until about 10 minutes in and then they\u2019ll just stare\u2014sometimes I can get a noise or sound out of them maybe a \u201coo\u201d but I figured my aunt had better things to do than wait that long. I sincerely believe that there was no reason for her to get so angry but I understand that I was wrong and will apologize. We won\u2019t be attending her Christmas party though. \n\nThanks for all the comments, I appreciate the nice ones with constructive criticism.

No way are you the asshole here. Apparently, everybody except your aunty understands the concept of young children being brutally honest.

She's way overreacting and passing judgment where none should exist,  IMO.\n\nAuntie needs to get over herself.", "I think everyone's behavior left something to be desired but your aunt was much, much worse so I'll go NTA. She was 100% out of line for reacting so seriously to toddlers not having proper manners - of course they don't. And making demands of you as a parent - ie the 'promise to raise your kids better' absolutely takes the cake, insanely presumptuous and self-congratulatory. She should have kept her assessment of your sons or your parenting to herself as it's frankly none of her business. \n\nI do think you responded in a childish way. You should have taken the high road in my opinion, if for no other reason but that you end up clouding the issue.

If they're old enough for \"please\" and \"thank you\" to be part of their vocabulary, then a prompt from you to thank the aunt themselves is appropriate.", "NTA first of all who is offended by the behaviors of a 2 year old? Grow up, seriously. Second of all, it sounds like she is just being petty because she doesn't really know your kids that well. Personally I know just enough about psychology to understand justification versus rationalization, don't get me wrong, I don't think you're 100% right but your Aunt definitely should know better and at least have the self respect to just ignore the situation and let it go. Instead of again, basing life decisions off of the actions of a 2 year old.", "NTA: the kids are so young that to be upset over no getting a thank you is just crazy.

Also you make a big point about what they like to play with like your aunt is supposed to know your kids inside out. \n\nOn the other hand, she's also severly overreacting, but she's initially not wrong.\n\nEdit : to everyone answering that your 2 years old can't say thank you - it doesn't have to be the exact words but any kind of reaction like a hug or something, not just letting them run away to their dad like nothing happened", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that she\u2019s offended by toddlers, but by you just straight up allowing them to be rude in her home and doing absolutely nothing about it, and instead made up excuses. As a parent, you should be trying to correct that behavior now so it does not persist as they grow up.

DO NOT apologize.  Holy cow, the kids are 2 years old.  Barely talking and as you said, totally self absorbed and egocentric.  You can have a great Christmas dinner without going to your aunt's house.  Even if it's just pizza, it would be way more fun than listening to another absurd lecture.", "Nta. You thanked her. Your boys are 2. They are incapable of being \"rude\" because it's not a concept they can grasp yet. There's a time and place for enforcing/teaching manners. Grabbing 2 toddlers to haul them over to aunty and try to force them to say thankyou when they are already not very verbal.and  its during a party where they're is overwhelming noise and excitement would have been asking for toddler tantrums. Your aunt was the rude one who insulted you and your children and now she's all butthurt you clapped back. I'd tell mom that you have no intention of attending the party until aunty apologizes. Its ironic the 60 year old woman with poor manners and etiquette is expecting toddlers to be more mature than she is.", "I kind of feel like the way that you teach little ones to eventually be gracious and polite is to model it **for** them long before they are capable of doing it themselves.  \n\nWhenever I give a gift to a friend's baby, my friend usually draws their attention to it and loudly and clearly says \"oh thank you Auntie Grizelda!\".  Then the kid is free to ignore me and go back to sucking on its toes or whatever.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is a crazy asshole - you should not allow her to traumatize your kids. Stand your ground.", "Hey...just a question, how are they responding to their names or eye contact? \n\nFor them to not really be talking at 2, like not even babble or \"mommy/daddy\" could potentially be a speech delay. That coupled with the hyper fixation on specific objects/colors could be an early sign of a few different things. Worth asking your doctor about at the next check up.

She threw a temper tantrum because toddlers she presumably knows nothing about didn\u2019t like her gifts, insulted your parenting and you, and is now threatening to blow up a bunch of drama over the holidays unless you apologize. I wouldn\u2019t want to go to her home anyways.", "NTA. Even before I read your comment about them not speaking yet, I was voting this. As a child I had family members that would buy me gifts that were the opposite of what I would ask for. I learned from a young age to pretend to like them and say thank you because otherwise it would result in stern talkings. They\u2019re 2. They\u2019re only interested in super specific things. Of course they\u2019re not going to care and an adult throwing a fit over this is ridiculous.", "NTA. The comments here are ridiculous. She's said the kids can't talk.

They already get so many toys from people trying to buy their love and young kids truly do not care about many of these toys.  Plus, the parents live in limited space and don't have the room for tons of toys.  We got the idea from our daughter in law who said that her grandparents had done this same thing for her and that when she went to college, she had a nice little nest egg that she truly appreciated and could use as opposed to just tons of cheap crap that is going to break/get ignored in a few months anyway.

Which is the truth? \n\nIf they're non-verbal, *you needed to say that*. Telling her that the babies CAN say thank you but won't thank HER was pretty much guaranteed to upset her; whether you meant to or not, you conveyed disdain for the gift and the giver. \n\nYTA, I think. If your kids are actually non-verbal, you still need to model gratitude for them. \"What do we say? That's right, 'thank you'! Yay!\" is pretty basic stuff that my family did with literal babies (who clearly couldn't talk) just to get them accustomed to the ritual of gift exchange. You waiting until your twins are 3 or 4 seems like you're unnecessarily making learning harder for them.", "NTA - your aunt sounds like a toddler. And only an asshole judges other peoples parenting to their face. \n\nAn adult should know that kids might find the box or the wrapping paper more interesting than the present.

And it has to be done immediately and in  person if the gift was given in  person. Mind you, I've also seen that they don't feel it's as important to thank the many people that help them out day to day. So your aunt comes by this behavior honestly and you have to come up with a strategy of how you plan to  deal with your children & the receipt of gifts. I would get them used to thanking adults immediately when they receive a gift.

All you had to do was some parenting: \"hey boys, say thank you to auntie!\"  Even if they just said something incomprehensible in toddler language, it's showing that you care and showing them what's expected.   I doubt your aunt was expecting some eloquent response from 2 year olds.  \n\n\nThat's it!  As u/thirdtryisthecharm stated, it wasn't what the boys did.  It was the lackadaisical \"I don't care about you\" way ***YOU*** reacted.  \n\nOf course, she way overreacted to that but your attitude is what sparked it.", "NTA", "Nta.

NTA for standing up for your kids.", "Everyone else is wrong. You\u2019re not an asshole, you\u2019re not overbearing to your kids (as you would be if you forced them to thank her), and she was the entitled one! She got gifts that your kids wouldn\u2019t like because she didn\u2019t bother to ask you what they would like, and then expected them to perform a \u201cthank you\u201d for her uninvited, lazy attempt at gift giving! Sounds like she\u2019s the type to only give \u201cgifts\u201d with strings attached; expects unrealistic special treatment for a half-assed gift. Can\u2019t ever just be happy to give. She would undoubtedly give your kids an unhealthy understanding of the nature of gift giving.\n\nYou were completely right for not dragging your kids over and going \u201cWhat do we say\u2026?\u201d And trying to force a \u201cthank you\u201d out of them. Because they ran off already when the gifts were presented, your opportunity to show them that \u201cgifts = say thank you\u201d was no longer available.  If you took them back and tried to get them to say \u201cthank you\u201d they wouldn\u2019t understand why because the moment already passed. It would frustrate them, and teach them that if they don\u2019t say thank you they will be pushed to their limit, and then they\u2019ll have a negative emotion associated with what should be a happy, grateful phrase. The proper way to teach kids to say thank you is to LEAD BY EXAMPLE. If you\u2019re saying \u201cthank you\u201d to them every time they give you something or do something nice, and they\u2019re not saying it yet, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re rude! It means they literally are not able to replicate that speech pattern yet! If they\u2019re taught sign language for \u201cthank you\u201d from very early on, leading by example, it\u2019s actually much easier for young toddlers to communicate via sign language than imitate words. They can learn how to sign way faster than they can learn how to talk. Anyway! N T A!

Even as a baby, I would take my kids on my hip and grab their hand and make them pat the person who gave them a gift's arm or hand while I said thank you for them. Then I tapped their chin while they looked at me and slowly enunciated \"Th-Ank You\" for them to see how the words were formed. When they could walk and start talking, I would take them with me and even if they hated the gift, I would make them at least say something. Even if it was close to thank you. my son would shake hands and my daughter would too, unless she was comfortable then she would give hugs. I always told my kids you don't have to like the toys, you don't have to play with them, but you HAVE to say thank you and be gracious. \n\nThis is why...someone thought of my kids. When they selected that toy, my kids were thought of. So, I make sure my kids, no matter their age, thank them personally.

I cannot believe you think your kid saying thank you should be precedented on whether he approves the gift or not, and your attitude of it being a waste of time to even try getting a thank you out of them is appalling.\n\nI actually want to cheer your aunt, because she honestly said what so many of us think when encountering poorly behaved children these days: your kid is being raised poorly, and yes, we're judging you. Also, if you aren't grateful, you don't get anything and my desire to give or do anything for you, ever again, in the future just died.\n\nBut she did escalate more than necessary and in front of a crowd, so while a hero, she's the asshole hero we deserve.", "YTA. \n\nYou were rude, and you are not teaching your kids manners.

I mean as a kid, the quicker I said thank you, the suckier the gift, which is to say if I got a cool/fun gift I was already playing with it, figuring out how to play with it and would get pulled out of my reverie by my folks saying \"what do we saaaayyyy\".   It is how, as an adult, i rate the success of the gift for a kid.\n\nAs a parent, I really tried to avoid saying \"what do we sayyy\" (tho I admit I certainly have).  I mainly try to give my spawn time to appreciate the gift and then give a thank you.  If I prompt for it, then, frankly, it seems pretty meaningless.\n\nI suppose every gift giver deserves a thank you,  I kinda quibble over \"owed\" but... ah well.\n\nseems like both sides of this particular conflict are in the wrong, ESH  I can't imagine getting bent out of shape when I don't get a thank you from a 2 year old .  OP, I mean jeeze louise,  I don't think I've every equated the term \"self absorbed\" with a toddler.  I mean... yeah I suppose they are if you are looking at them with a filter of \"I rate all behaviors as if the person is an adult\"... but a freshly made human is trying to figure out how this whole world thing works.  So yeah a lot of the time they are concerned with themselves.  I mean they are still barely figuring out the 'don't bump into stuff' thing.

Aunt should have had the grace to laugh about it and say 'right?' and not give it another thought. An adult calling a 2 year old rude just beggars belief. She needs to get over herself.\n\nHaving said that-OP, surely when she handed the gifts to your kids you could have said 'what do you say to Aunt Jane?' and not let them run off until they'd said thank you. 2 years old isn't too young for that.

But toddlers can learn the words and repeat them back.\n\nThe aunt was being over the top. OP probably could have handled it better, I guess, but I told people to fuck off for less so whatever.", "Key word, kids. Not toddler twins barely turned 2. and then villafying the mom cuz she one time forgot to have them say thankyou is childish.", "This post reminded me of my son who went through both a cars phase and a red phase when he was little, and had some difficulties with social skills in preschool. He just got diagnosed with ADHD at 13.", "I was thinking they sound a lot like my older one as well. OP, there is a lot of variation in how/when kids learn to speak, but I was pretty much in denial when my son was this age. The won\u2019t acknowledge you and stare for ten minutes part is, to me, actually concerning. There are many wonderful free programs for kids under three, please consider talking with your pediatrician/an expert about this.", "Totally agree, this post screams asd, I have personally seen similar behaviour in children of close friends and relatives who have since been diagnosed.", "Baby sign was such an amazing tool when my siblings started having kids. I really struggle to understand young kids when they start to speak due to hearing issues and baby sign just made it so much less stressful", "My almost 18 month old signs thank you. Please, thank you, more and all done have made a WORLD of difference in our house.", "Most of my kids could sign thank you before they could say it, but my language delayed preemie was 3 before she could do either, and her brother was well past 2 (and still in normal ranges for language) before he could.", "Exactly. My grandson turned 2 in September and he doesn\u2019t speak yet. Not all kids develop at the same rate.", "Convenient that you left out the last bit \"but they're still learning.\" It sounds like they might say it after extensive prompting (like 5-15 minutes) - and that's probably in the best of circumstances. That's completely unreasonable and OP already apologized and thanked the aunt. She is a grown woman who threw a fit because a couple of toddlers didn't say thank you.", "Or you could just not get heated that a 2 year old didn't say thank you, as an adult that's also an option you know. Especially when OP states her older kids did say thank you, though I may be wrong and the older ones aren't hers my point stands.", "I wasn't responding to OP's story, just to these comments:\n\n>Info: Did you instruct your toddlers to say \"thank you\" when they got their presents?   \n>>They\u2019re 2 fucking years old.", "Yep", "Two 2 year olds that don\u2019t speak it\u2019s kinda tough to make them say thank you if they don\u2019t say mamma or dadda", "Also twins can take longer to start talking because they communicate with each other non verbally and/or with their own language. They don\u2019t feel the need to talk to other people because they have each other. Source: my husband is a twin and his mom loves telling people what it was like raising twins, add in that my sister and I are just over a year apart and still talk without talking.

But i wouldn\u2019t expect it from a 3 year old either.  3 year olds are assholes. I had two of them. But then I\u2019m not a miserable cow. Mad at a baby.

Has she slept?  Unlikely.  Is she exhausted?  Almost definitely.  The boys ran off.   Wrestling those boys back would not have ended well.  It's called the \"terrible two's\" for a reason.  The OP apologized and thanked the aunt.  That should have been sufficient.   \n The one who needs a lesson in manners is the aunt.", "Too bad you forgot how to read along the way and couldn't read that the mom thanked them.

Car especially took a long time. Any completely new words he had down well for his age, but the ones he already had a sound for? Nah, fuck that. He started talking or learning actual words at around 2.5yo. He started going to kindergarden right after he turned 3yo, and now he learns words without stop. \n\nCuriously he was the same about walking. He could have walked waaay before he did, but he just couldnt be bothered, because he could already get around, so what was the point? It didnt take long after he started walking before he was literally running. It is pretty funny to look back at. We even had an appointment with his healthcare team about his delayed speech, but they basically also said he just didnt care to learn, and since he was clearly capable of associating specific sound with things, he just needed time.

He has Hearing aids now and is still struggling to catch up on speech Development, while his sister is perfectly within normal range in her speech Development.", "You\u2019re right. \n\nEvery kid is different too, a friend never spoke until he was almost 4 years old (parents took him to a specialist, nothing was wrong with him). One of my niblings was speaking full sentences at 1.5.", "Again they're toddlers why on earth would you get offended to begin with is my point?

Mom did not imply any gratitude whatsoever. Even if the kids are nonverbal, speaking to them and teaching is still valuable, even if they aren\u2019t ready to participate just yet. So mom failed to show gratitude on her behalf, and failed to show that she cares about her children learning values of gratitude.", "It\u2019s not about the toddlers\u2019 reactions.
