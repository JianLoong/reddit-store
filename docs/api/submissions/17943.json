My Aunt Adriann has always had money, so Mia never needed to steal out of necessity. She seemingly just did/does it because she can. In 6th grade, Mia was caught stealing from her teachers as well as other students. It obviously had been smaller amounts from each person, but she had stolen almost six hundred dollars in total. Aunt Adriann ended up putting Mia in a parochial school while lying to everyone else out of embarrassment that she had Mia transfer because the public schools available were not up to her standards.\n\nMia went to the same district as me for high school, just at a different high school. Rather than stealing money or physical objects, Mia began stealing work instead. I have friends at Mia's school, and most of the students at their high school have complaints about Mia not contributing and trying to pass off other people's work as her own. In the few cases where teachers and other parents were willing to bring it to the school's attention, Aunt Adriann would pull strings to get Mia out of any real trouble.\n\nI have a lot of emotional trauma because of my best friend Nicole's death several years ago. Her death caused me to fall into severe depression. I am doing better today but Nicole's death still does affect me. My therapist recommended that I write down my feelings, which did help. I discovered through a mutual acquaintance showing me the \"essay that Mia won a scholarship with\" that Mia had stolen my journal and submitted my entry about Nicole to a scholarship while claiming it as her own. Mia didn't even change Nicole's name. Mia saw firsthand how much emotional trauma I had gone through from Nicole's death. I was furious that she would stoop as low as to steal something so personal from me while claiming it was her own.\n\nI reported Mia to the organization that gave out the scholarship for plagiarism. I sent all the needed proof that I was the true author, I had not given Mia my permission, and that Mia never even attended the same school as Nicole, much less even knew her. The organization revoked Mia's scholarship, which I expected and thought deserved to happen. What I did not realize was that the scholarship organization is affiliated with the public university system of Mia's college. The organization reported what happened to Mia's college, and the college is considering it academic dishonesty. Mia and Aunt Adriann are going to try and petition the college in a week, but it is highly unlikely that Mia will regain her acceptance.\n\nOur whole family is divided. My Aunt Adriann says that I have ruined Mia's life and is threatening to never talk to me or my parents again. My parents and brother support me and say that Mia was wrong to steal something she knew was so personal to me and that Aunt Adriann should not have enabled Mia for this long. But the majority of the family is siding against me, saying I am a brat and that I ruined my cousin's life.

Right now she's still young and the path that her mother has paved for her is now closed because they're finally getting to the level where nobody's going to put up with their bullshit.
