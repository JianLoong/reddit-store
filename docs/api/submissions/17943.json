My Aunt Adriann has always had money, so Mia never needed to steal out of necessity. She seemingly just did/does it because she can. In 6th grade, Mia was caught stealing from her teachers as well as other students. It obviously had been smaller amounts from each person, but she had stolen almost six hundred dollars in total. Aunt Adriann ended up putting Mia in a parochial school while lying to everyone else out of embarrassment that she had Mia transfer because the public schools available were not up to her standards.\n\nMia went to the same district as me for high school, just at a different high school. Rather than stealing money or physical objects, Mia began stealing work instead. I have friends at Mia's school, and most of the students at their high school have complaints about Mia not contributing and trying to pass off other people's work as her own. In the few cases where teachers and other parents were willing to bring it to the school's attention, Aunt Adriann would pull strings to get Mia out of any real trouble.\n\nI have a lot of emotional trauma because of my best friend Nicole's death several years ago. Her death caused me to fall into severe depression. I am doing better today but Nicole's death still does affect me. My therapist recommended that I write down my feelings, which did help. I discovered through a mutual acquaintance showing me the \"essay that Mia won a scholarship with\" that Mia had stolen my journal and submitted my entry about Nicole to a scholarship while claiming it as her own. Mia didn't even change Nicole's name. Mia saw firsthand how much emotional trauma I had gone through from Nicole's death. I was furious that she would stoop as low as to steal something so personal from me while claiming it was her own.\n\nI reported Mia to the organization that gave out the scholarship for plagiarism. I sent all the needed proof that I was the true author, I had not given Mia my permission, and that Mia never even attended the same school as Nicole, much less even knew her. The organization revoked Mia's scholarship, which I expected and thought deserved to happen. What I did not realize was that the scholarship organization is affiliated with the public university system of Mia's college. The organization reported what happened to Mia's college, and the college is considering it academic dishonesty. Mia and Aunt Adriann are going to try and petition the college in a week, but it is highly unlikely that Mia will regain her acceptance.\n\nOur whole family is divided. My Aunt Adriann says that I have ruined Mia's life and is threatening to never talk to me or my parents again. My parents and brother support me and say that Mia was wrong to steal something she knew was so personal to me and that Aunt Adriann should not have enabled Mia for this long. But the majority of the family is siding against me, saying I am a brat and that I ruined my cousin's life.

If you\u2019re an active student at a university and are caught plagiarizing, there\u2019s a good chance you will be expelled from the university and that will make it extremely difficult to be able to enroll into another university of the same caliber. \n\nConsider this a wake up call for Mia because it is sooooo easy to detect plagiarism at the university level. Maybe she\u2019ll actually learn a lesson, instead of having her parent bail her out time and time again. NTA", "Tell Adriann that you are doing her a good turn. Mia would have crashed and burned in college the first time she got caught plagiarizing someone. This way, they aren't out the money that they would have given the university.\n\nThis has the advantage of being true! However, this will not match the narrative that Adriann has about her daughter.", "Makes me wonder if the entire family is siding with Aunt Adriann because they\u2019re in her payroll. How would anyone think it was okay for her to remain unreported? Simply to not rock the boat? Ugh", "I wonder if the family is gaslighting bc they don\u2019t want to upset the rich family members. It\u2019s ridiculous to think she\u2019s anywhere in the wrong. \n\nThis is so NTA OP and my sincerest condolences. You did the right thing.", "Additionally- she took the scholarship from someone who actually wrote something of their own. Now someone who actually deserves the scholarship can get it :)", "Hell I have been working with my 6YO daughter about this! Teaching her that mal/bad actions have consequences. When basically learning \"adulting\" that should be taught to her long ago. The audacity. I'm not even close to a perfect parent by my own standards but the taught entitlement and neglect is nothing but bad, even to me.", "The only thing she actually did in her own lol", "She would been found out eventually anyway. People who plagiarize always get expulsion in college once found since this seems like a nasty habit of Mia's.", "I knew I had read this before. The irony\u2026", "PS: she is quite capable of making atonement and earning her way back into higher education. But that is up to her.", "I did too. Best of Redditor Updates.", "Sounds like their nearing the end of high school, old enough to know stealing is bad and even worse she displayed op's private thoughts to everyone. No conversation with this person would've gone anywhere considering what they did in the first place. And what does that conversation look like ? Mia's magically going to grow a conscious , revoke the essay and make it not public? Mia's reaction alone tells you that wasn't going to happen.\n\nAlso OP was just supposed to sit tight and happy having everyone read through her trauma ? calling even just to have them destroy their copy and have it not be public is well within their right.", "She would have been kicked pretty fast. Most Universities have anti-plagiarism software. She would have been found out very fast and got kicked.", "Yep, exactly. Getting denied admission to a college is way less \"life-ruining\" than getting kicked out. If Mia actually learns something from this, then OP will have done her a huge favor. Hope Mia has some more sensible people around her like OP who encourage her to change her ways.", "She can go to community college and get kicked but there and save a lot of money. NTA", "Because the aunt made sure Mia never had serious consequences for her behavior, this was inevitable. At some point, Mia would be kicked out of college for stealing someone else's work, if OP hadn't done this now.", "This is the biggest takeaway. She was stealing a spot and help from someone who earned it. NTA forever.", "This.", "Also tell your aunt that Mia should be forced to take a gap year and do real work for a living (e.g., wait tables or customer service) and then reapply this fall for 2024. It might give Mia time to grow up and be held accountable while applying again to schools during the normal application timelines for 1st year students.", "I'd hope the family members siding against OP are the ones the aunt kept in the dark with her lies covering up the school change and various complaints she managed to squash down. They may be doing that whole \"her whole future jeopardized because of one teenage mistake\" but this isn't one mistake it's a lifetime of issues and plagiarizing for scholarships and at a university level is a BIG DEAL, it's an adult fuck up that follows you around. If she'd actually been an active attending student when the plagiarism came to light it wouldn't be revoking the acceptance...it would have been an investigation and expulsion at a tertiary level. Good luck getting into another university. If she'd been trying to study law she wouldn't be accepted into the bar, plagiarism shows the character of the person to be deceitful, thieving and untrustworthy.  Good luck getting any job where character counts", "Yeah, but she also stole a spot from another unknown student that actually deserved it.", "NTA. And technically because of the situation she may have helped Mia inadvertently because schools may overlook the plagiarism slightly less than the inevitable expulsion.", "Every single college and university these days requires you to submit your work either in person and through a plagarism portal or automatically runs every online submission through a plagarism portal.\n\nIt is *nearly* impossible to be a plagarizer in a university these days.", "People are so focussed on the punishment aspect that they're ignoring that this is likely the best chance for her. This is a real chance for her to improve, and if she grows up to be a halfway decent person one day she will appreciate this.", "The question is would her mother have enough money and social standing to shift the blame onto other students initially- they'd figure it out when it became a reoccurring problem but if it got other kids kicked out for \"plagerising Mia\" in the meantime that won't change the fact she derailed their lives", "Some people are that stupid though. I found one that stupid on Twitter the other day who got an AI to write their paper and easily got found. Some people just don't proof-read their papers before sending it off."]}
