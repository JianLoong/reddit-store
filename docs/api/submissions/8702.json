I have noticed that they are continuously gaining weight. I cut back on portions for dinner. Cut back on fast food, and took my daughters to the gym after school. It hasn't made impact on their weights at all. Doctor's advice had no effect.\n\nI'm not going to beat around the bush here. My daughters are both fat. They are very close to being 200 lbs and this is something I'd like fixed immediately.\n\nHow did this happen?  Their father spoils them rotten with pizza, birthday cake and weekly McDonalds and I told him that the junk food stops today.\n\nI recently started keto a few months ago and it's done wonders on my weight. Lost a good 40 lbs in a few months and I'd like to see the same results for my daughters. \n\nWhat keto essentially is to make a long story short, High Fat, minimal carbs. The lack of carbs forces the body to convert fat reserves into energy. I've done research on the subject that it causes significant weight loss and reduces the risk of diabetes, which runs in our family. This means that they can no longer have sugar, bread, pasta, fruits, or starchy vegetables such as potatoes. They are encouraged to eat more protein like eggs, chicken, steak, and cheese.\n\nI told them that they are gaining so much weight that it needs to be fixed immediately. They will be placed on keto. I threw out their favorite snacks and treats, and anything not considered keto in the trash and started cooking keto friendly meals like chicken and veggies, or steak and cauliflower. I even made keto alternatives of their favorite foods. \n\nI have requested their school follow the dietary guidelines I have set for them and to not provide them with school lunch and ensure that they are eating the foods i provide them\n\nMy daughters threw a fit about it and went behind my back to order McDonalds, which I threw out their food before they ate it and took away their phones as punishment. They told me I was being overbearing and they should be allowed to eat whatever they want. I told them that eating whatever they wanted was the reason why are over 150+ lbs and look like what came out of an episode of my 600lb life.\n\nMy husband thought I was being ridiculous and I should speak to them to see if they want to do the diet. Which I then told him that he was the cause of the problem and he should support us. He also told them I will make our daughters hate us.\n\nI begin to ask myself if I'm doing the right thing. If I should have listened to my daughters. I want what's best for them but I dont want to strain the relationship.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675104430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pahi1/aita_for_putting_my_2_daughters_on_the_keto_diet/", "score": 887, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they\u2019re used to overeating, it could be their stomachs are stretched to accommodate more food and thus will feel hungry if you just try to par down the portions. And also an issue of telling when to stop eating- being stuffed to bursting shouldn\u2019t be the signal to stop eating. But this is something that takes time to learn. If there are house wide dietary rules (father MUST be included), then you\u2019ll have a better chance. You need a talk with your husband about creating this, and then have a family wide meeting about it.

Fat child, fat teen, and fat adult here - currently on a weight loss journey myself.\n\nI think there's nothing wrong with wanting your daughters to be healthy. I think that's good. However, the way you're going about it is all wrong. Going from one extreme to another rarely works, and going keto is, in fact, going to a huge extreme. You can eat better, get active, and lose weight while still enjoying McDonald's or a sweet treat on occasion. How do I know? I'm doing it.\n\nMy real issue with this is this comment:\n\n>I told them that eating whatever they wanted was the reason why are over 150+ lbs and look like what came out of an episode of my 600lb life.\n\nThis is dehumanizing. \"Look like what came out of\"? That's a person. That's a human being, just like you, just like your daughters. My mother - who is also fat - made a similar comment to me when I was 15. I'm nearly 29 now and still remember it. Guess who I don't talk to anymore, like, ever? Surprise.\n\nWhile you're working on getting the whole family healthy and in better spirits, you should also try being a better person.

All you're doing is creating an environment where they will sneak food. This will cause an even more unhealthy relationship with food and lead to even more problems down the road.\n\nThe idea here is to help them have a better relationship with food. McDonald's every now and then is okay, just not every day. Identifying their psychological triggers to food can also help ALL of you work toward healthier choices and decisions. Taking the choice away from them and making a unilateral decision will bite you.\n\nI recommend a nutritionist and a second opinion from a doctor. Has PCOS been ruled out?

I'd also speak to a physician about the **negative implications of long term keto dieting can have on the body.**  \n\nEating whatever you want isn't a bad thing as long as it's done in ***moderation,*** and it helps prevent overwhelming cravings and binge eating of 'forbidden' food.  Appropriate protein is essential along with fruits and veggies. Carbs are not the enemy and it's sad that that ideology has been pushed for so long, people believe it is fact.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not your job to fat-shame your daughters.  You should be providing them with a good variety of healthy food.  Keto, like every other fad diet, is not balanced.\n\nIt's absolutely fine for you to prohibit junk food and fast food in your home, but forcing them to adhere to a specific diet is not going to work.  It worked for you because you were motivated to lose weight.  They aren't, so it won't work.", "Dietitian here, YTA. There are a lot of great points that are already on here from other people, such as medical conditions, and such. \n\nI want to take a different route. You are setting your daughters up to have a terrible, lifelong relationship with food. They are currently eating tons of junk food and now you are doing a complete 180 and trying to go on a restrictive diet. How about just removing junk food out of their diet. Or at least limiting it and learning a healthy relationship with food? \n\nFood is energy, and should be viewed as such. It is not a celebration or something that should be viewed as something to make you feel better when you are having a bad day. \n\nSomething else to think about. Children need carbohydrates to maintain energy levels, and to grow. What about getting with a dietitian to help learn healthy eating patterns? \n\nAlso, something that isn\u2019t widely talked about is potential health risks that are associated with eating low carb. The rest of the calories have to come from somewhere. That means high fat and high protein. I know everyone knows someone that has done amazingly well on keto, but for every person that excels on the diet are 10 other people that are now dealing with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular issues. I see it all the time with my patients. On top of those risks, when people are on a keto diet the loose, on average 10% of their muscle mass. Children should have to go through that. \nModeration is a great way to look at food. \n\nHere is a great article that goes into the keto diet for children\n [https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-kids-shouldnt-go-on-the-keto-diet-for-weight-loss/amp/](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-kids-shouldnt-go-on-the-keto-diet-for-weight-loss/amp/)", "YTA \n\n>How did this happen?

What you are doing is a recipe for eating disorders.\n\nI get that you want to help your daughters but forcing them to take on a controversial diet isn't the way. Passive encouragement of healthy lifestyle choices goes a long way. Plan activities with them that get them active, encourage them to sign up for dance, swim, or yoga.

I\u2019m replying to this as both a fitness coach and someone who has struggled with an eating disorder my entire life. \n\n(1) weight loss is not \u201cimmediate,\u201d especially in growing kids. Right now, their bodies are still growing, so any sort of weightloss is not going to happen overnight. Expecting that to be the case is unrealistic and harmful.\n(2) it is not the school\u2019s job to regulate what your kids eat and you are way overstepping by expecting them to participate in your crusade.\n(3) the Keto diet was developed for people with epilepsy, not for people who are overweight. Yes you will lose a lot of weight quickly, but it comes back the second you consume carbs. Your body NEEDS carbs, I don\u2019t care what the internet told you. Carbs are what give us energy, not only so that we can exercise, but so our body can maintain homeostasis. Keto is not sustainable and frankly, i can\u2019t believe you would force this kind of diet on your kids because it worked for you (temporarily). A diet that works for one person may not work for everyone, as we all have different body compositions, hormone concentrations, etc etc. \n(4) why would you not sit your daughters down and explain your concerns, and emphasize the importance of developing healthy habits? Crash diets are not sustainable, especially when they are not the ones making these choices for themselves. By forcing it on them, you are taking away their control, which is just begging them to develop eating disorders so they can feel like they have some control over their bodies/lives. You can\u2019t make huge changes all at once and expect immediate results. Instead, success comes from making small, gradual changes over time. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it was intentional, but the way that you wrote this conveyed that you see your daughters\u2019 weight gain as a moral failing.

Try counselling to see what the behaviours mechanism is this, that's my advice on the hubby part.\n\nYour kids are old enough to see how they want to look and share these things with you. But to make them do that you have to create the environment for this, to make them feel safe with you. Unfortunately, my mother was unable to do that and I seekers help myself as I have recently started going to a dietician and I'm starting to go to pilates classes and also some Zumba classes or other activities because I'm sick of looking like this and living an unhappy and unsatisfactory life. \n\nI'm sure you can push them gently towards showing them the good side of eating healthy, but the answer is never to cut certain groups of food, just limit them or find replacements. You can educate them on why this food is good. My dietician tells me that the answer is in the rooth of each one of us - what they used to eat as kids (before they started gaining weight). Try to cook more basic foods, don't follow diets as this is not the key and it could lead to more complications. \n\nAlso in terms of exercising, try to go with them, try to bond but start with something small as walking short distances and then go to an activity like mines. This is very important because it would affect their mood, their thinking, their sleep, their life and they'll get tired and also feel better and lighter. They would be able to join activities and meet new people (you can also encourage them this way and display it as a way of meeting people from different backgrounds, sharing the same body image issues and working towards mutual goal, perfect environment and people are often nice speaking from my experience).\n\nYou're NTA for being worry of them, but don't push them, guide them only in a friendly manner and gain their trust and make them feel safe. \n\nGood luck, OP!

You are destroying your daughters' relationship with food and with you. Telling them they \"look like what came out of an episode of My 600 lb life\" is deliberately hateful and meant to shame them. ETA: RESEARCH SHOWS SHAMING PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT MAKES THEM GAIN MORE WEIGHT. IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE NO MATTER HOW DESPERATEL YOU WANT TO BULLY THEM INTO IT.

A good, responsible parent would figure out how to get them to 1 & 2, and work with as many professionals as takes to understand 3. How do you get them to WANT to? It's definitely harder than just lobbing hateful words at them, but you can start by asking them what they want to do with their lives and socially and if there's anything preventing them from living the life they want to live or feeling the way they want to feel. Then you can identify some choices TOGETHER that you can SUPPORT them in making.\n\nYou said doctor's advice didn't work.

Lost a good 40 lbs in a few months and I'd like to see the same results for my daughters. \n\nWhat keto essentially is to make a long story short, High Fat, minimal carbs. The lack of carbs forces the body to convert fat reserves into energy. I've done research on the subject that it causes significant weight loss and reduces the risk of diabetes, which runs in our family. This means that they can no longer have sugar, bread, pasta, fruits, or starchy vegetables such as potatoes. They are encouraged to eat more protein like eggs, chicken, steak, and cheese.\n\nI told them that they are gaining so much weight that it needs to be fixed immediately. They will be placed on keto. I threw out their favorite snacks and treats, and anything not considered keto in the trash and started cooking keto friendly meals like chicken and veggies, or steak and cauliflower. I even made keto alternatives of their favorite foods. \n\nI have requested their school follow the dietary guidelines I have set for them and to not provide them with school lunch and ensure that they are eating the foods i provide them\n\nMy daughters threw a fit about it and went behind my back to order McDonalds, which I threw out their food before they ate it and took away their phones as punishment.

And if these teens are eating a lot of carbs and junk food, it's pretty safe to assume they experience more frequent spikes and drops in blood sugar, which results in making you feel hungry even if you've already had a ton of calories and you are significantly more likely to be overeating if your body is used to having a higher blood sugar baseline (which puts extra pressure on your pancreas and over time, especially with a genetic propensity like OP mentioned, can result in developing type-2 diabetes). Weight is not necessarily indicative of health, but the crap you put in your body absolutely impacts your health, in the long-term and sometimes short-term. No where did I say skinny = healthy.", "That article literally just explains the basics of what a keto diet looks like\u2026no information on why it would be a negative so im not sure why u linked it", "I think OP is also concerned about them hitting that weight at such a young age. If they are 200 lbs at 14/16 and have bad habits then it\u2019s only going to get worse. But OP is panicking and is not doing the right thing by forcing this on her daughters. Small changes win out. \n\nAt my heaviest I was 240 and yo-yoed for years. Keto helped get me to my goal weight but it wasn\u2019t doable long term for me. The small changes like no junk food and eliminating sugar made the difference in the end now I am 170!", "You\u2019re not being objective at all. \u201cInsanely fat\u201d could mean anything. If they are obese by BMI standards, then they are \u201cfat\u201d even if it\u2019s a crass way to put it.", "I\u2019ve checked (turns out I still follow him\u2026) and it\u2019s Jordan Syatt.\n\nBut any personal trainer/nutritionist worth their while will say the same thing. Those promoting otherwise are quite dangerous. At the end of the day it is calories in vs calories out but done right.", "Yeah they\u2019re not obese, just overweight. They could both stand to lose 20-30 lbs, that\u2019s something they should work on in a healthy way, not restricting food groups. Portion control and nutrition information from a professional should be what they work on, and therapy probably, more for what the mother has taught them than anything.", "That is pretty fat for a 5'4\" girl. I am a chubby dude who worked construction my whole life at 5'10\" I weigh that much. My doctor kept telling me to lose weight last time I saw him. I do agree that OP is a maniac though for not following the Drs suggested diet.", "Ah, the \"Freshman 15.\" In the context of this post, it makes sooo much more sense now.\n\nI'm almost 45 and I still don't have a good relationship with food. But I've been losing weight, so I don't really care if my relationship with food is unhealthy. Which is honestly really fucked up, but my mom *still* asks me if I've lost any more weight. I hear her voice in my head if I eat dessert. \"Do you *really* need that? I'll pay for weight watchers for you, you know....\"", "Lizzo seems happy and positive with her body which is great. She seems fairly active and has some healthy activities. She is not healthy though as she is very heavy and that in itself is not good for you.", "Read OP\u2019s comment history. The younger one (14) is 155 lbs, the older (16) is like 180. They\u2019re not 200 lbs, she\u2019s being melodramatic.", "This is super ignorant. There are dozens of things that could contribute to a teenager being significantly overweight that aren\u2019t an eating disorder.", "This just isn't true. At 14/16, most girls have already gone through puberty and reached their \"final\" height \u2014 physical growth is pretty limited beyond those ages for many girls, and your energy needs change accordingly. All the while though, you have access to the same diet and lifestyle as before your energy needs adjusted. You also don't need to consume a lot of food to get a butt load of calories. In a single Mac Donald's Big Mac meal, there are 1100 calories \u2014 half the daily requirement for girls their ages. In a *single meal.*\n\nLow volume, high calorie foods are some of the most accessible foods in developed countries. You don't have to eat very much to have a high calorie diet. Regular coke, which doesn't make you feel even remotely full, has 140 calories. If that's what you drink when you're thirsty, you can end up in caloric excess and gaining weight even while eating according to dietary recommendations.\n\nYour comment is plainly ignorant and highly presumptuous.", "I guarantee you it\u2019s not the first time. She sounds like my mom- she periodically feels bad about herself and then projects it onto everyone else, forcing people to do weird diets until she\u2019s over it. Weight is so subjective and person specific, just because one of the daughters is 189 (which is a crazy specific number for OP to just know), doesn\u2019t mean anything. With my height and build, I\u2019m skinny at about 180, so at 189 I would still be skinny. OP\u2019s daughter could be that. But even if she\u2019s not, keto isn\u2019t good for you. Cut out fast food, sure, but this is ridiculous.", "She clarified in a comment. They are 155 and 189 pounds. Especially the youngest isn\u2019t near 200 unless you\u2019re rounding to the nearest 50.", "Exaclty, it's important how you're following the diet. Eating bacon and drinking diet coke is not good.\n\nThere's a clean and healthy eating to do it.", "Most people don\u2019t do Keto or Atkins or low carb \u201ccorrectly\u201d.  They eat all the meat and cheese they want then say veggies have too many carbs.", "And you aren\u2019t a teenager alternating homes.  High fat/low carb diet (when mom sees them eat), the rest of the time junk food.  Keto won\u2019t work that way.  It will increase their health risks at 200 lbs.", "You can even get whole grain pasta!", "Small lifestyle changes are definitely the way to go, not a complete change in diet!", "I was the same weight bracket as OP's daughters as a teen. My parents did things the *right way*- took me to the doctors, did blood-work (came back perfect), talked *with* me over what to do.\nTurns out my body decided it was going to do all the growing in my early 20s instead of my teen years so instead I stayed short and fat then shot up almost a half-foot at age 21 going from 4 ft 8 inches to 5 ft 4; and went from a 30B bra to a 40D in the next two years. That trend continued for the next 3/4-ish years. Bodies are weird and not everyone follows the same growth curve.", "BMI has been dismissed by health professionals for a long time now. OP is fine to want to establish a healthier weight and better eating habits, but a dramatic 180 shift in what they're \"allowed\" to eat and punishment if they don't follow will NOT help with that! Their daughters will develop an unhealthy relationship with food that way", "It\u2019s almost like men\u2019s and women\u2019s bodies are different", "Oh didn\u2019t see the updated weights. OP has some issues. These weight completely change things.", "Haha! Called it. I commented higher up that the fact that op said 150+ means they're actually probably closer to 150 rather than \" almost 200\". 155 and 180 could be healthy weights or just slightly overweight for these girls depending on their height. Plus we don't actually know their body shape or anything about their musculature. That 180 could be mostly muscle. They could be just of the shape that is likely to gain weight during puberty. There are so many things that are wrong with this equation and this mom is absolutely going to screw them over.", "I\u2019m only 5 ft tall and 155-160. Im bigger than I would like but I\u2019m not even particularly fat. I just happen to be a curvier person with strong thighs lmao. I\u2019m perfectly healthy in the ways it matters. I\u2019ve never had a doctor suggest I needed to lose weight. Sounds like OP has her own body image issues and she\u2019s projecting them onto her daughters now. Way to perpetuate that generational trauma OP.", "What are their heights? Plays an important factor", "You are right. Not denying that but 200 lbs at 14 means the odds are heavily skewed towards an eating disorder. Not fat shaming just being realistic that 200 is a very unhealthy weight. \n\nBut OP posted the girls actual weights and they are nowhere near 200. They do not have eating disorders.", "Saying \"they\" are close to 200 pounds was a lie then. One of them is and the other may be at a healthy weight already depending on her height.", "Right. It is also essentially the same as a \"diet\" meant to control diabetes before there was insulin. There are early 20th century books that advise essentially the same way of eating.\n\nI try not to discuss keto too much with people who don't do it, or don't understand it. It unfortunately also seems to be attractive to those who want an \"easy\" fix or have disordered eating already. People who find out I do keto think I eat bacon, cheese and steak all day, when really I'm eating chicken breast and broccoli, with olive oils and avocados, etc. Fat on keto is a limit, not a goal. I was prediabetic before starting keto, now I am not. I mostly eat keto, with some breaks here and there, but still am very cognizant of what carbs I eat when not doing keto so that I continue to be able to not have to take insulin. \n\nI still think OP is TA, because her kids don't want to do it. And if they don't, they will eat outside of keto and be gaining due to the high fat, since OP seems to think a high goal of fat is necessary. You need a reasonable amount, but as I said, it's a limit not a goal. Going from no restrictions to what can feel like a very restrictive diet is not a good solution, especially when they are not interested.", "Totally. But saying keto is going to cause heart disease is misleading. Doing any diet while eating bad processed foods is going to end poorly. You can but super unhealthy on a vegan diet as well if you eat potato chips all day.", "Men are typically heavier though, cause they have a larger proportion of muscle. The girls are overwight.", "Yeah, I\u2019m 5\u20193 and around 150. I could do with losing maybe 5 pounds of fat, but that\u2019s it (I am fairly muscular)", "Also, as I pointed out in my own comment judging the OP, puberty can make kids gain weight. Everything is awkward and the body changes. Hips get wider and boobs are heavy and they get a little bit of belly. It happens. I know fast food frequently doesn\u2019t help but keto will solve exactly zero problems here. OP cares about having pretty daughters, not healthy and happy daughters.", "I'm gonna assume to avenge hight for a 14/16 year old and say around 5-3 to 5-7, witch would put them into the overweight category by less than 10lb\n\nThe mom needs to chill the f out", "Copied from the OP\n\n\u201cMy 14 yr old is 5'1\" and is about 155ish pounds. My 16yr old is 5'4 and is around 189 lbs. They would both fall into the obese range. Neither of them exercise.\n\nThe doctor gave us very basic advise such as 1 protein, 1 carb, and 1 veggie but I am still not seeing results. They haven't lost a pound 1 week.\u201d\n\nI was 155 lbs in my senior year of high school and I\u2019m 5\u2019 2\u201d. I was in two competitive after school clubs that required constant movement and I had a job with constant running. That\u2019s not obese.", "Yes OP did lie.", "Even the one that's 189 lbs (and what a precise number for OP to know off the top of her head!) might be at a healthy weight for all we know, since OP has thrown out numbers for weight but not for height, and hasn't given any information on the girls' lifestyle.", "Imagine being 14 yrs old and less than 10 lbs overweight and your mom calls you fat and forces you on a diet.\n\nFr i have an eating disorder by proxy after reading this.", "I was 160 as a 5 9 male who carried a lot of muscle and a good amount of fat as a senior in HS. I\u2019d also cut it down to 140 for wrestling season. \n\nI\u2019m 180 now as a 30 year old man and I\u2019m fairly over weight. Being chill with a 16 year old girl being heavier than me is bonkers. \n\n**definitely** YTA towards OP, but everybody is hand waving away their weights when they\u2019re definitely on the fat side of the weight range. They clearly need some counseling and maybe a few sessions with a physical trainer.", "\nKeto isn't even a good diet for everyone and can cause you go be very sick. The mom should not force it"]}
