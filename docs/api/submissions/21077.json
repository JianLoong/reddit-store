One of them, \"Layla\", brought along a friend of theirs without consulting the rest of the group, something I wouldn't have minded had it been literally any other person than the one she invited. \n\n\"Kate\" used to bully me in middle school because of my very slender stature, amongst other things. I was a bit of an ugly duckling back then and rather tomboyish. She went out of her way to make snide comments about me whenever the chance arose. I wasn't entirely innocent, though, as I did the same in retaliation. We apologized to one another sometime around the start of high school and I accepted hers because since I had grown out of that behavior, I figured she had, too, and really, what child *wasn't* terrible in MS? I quickly realized this couldn't have been further from the truth when she slid back into her old habits soon after. I steered clear of her for the remainder of high school career; we never had any classes together and up until the day of the incident, I hadn't known she was friends with Layla.\n\nMy acquaintances and I aren't close, so I don't fault that one person for inviting Kate. Idk if she knew our history. Despite my displeasure, I treated Kate same as everyone else. Unfortunately, she didn't extend the same courtesy. She made a point of remarking that \"I hadn't grown since middle school\" sometime around when we first entered the restaurant and she poked fun at the size of the dish I ordered. When I returned from the bathroom after touching up my lip gloss at the end of my meal, she asked if I \"had flushed good and needed a breath mint\". I told her that was disrespectful and to mind her own business. She said she was \"just joking\". \n\nWe all intended on paying for our own meals when the separate bill came around. But Kate realized she had overspent by about $40 dollars and asked if she could borrow some cash from one of us. The thing was, most of my acquaintances had bought only enough for their own meals and maybe a ride home. The person who invited Kate was able to loan her $5 and another, $10. I had mentioned going shopping after we ate, so the group knew I had quite a bit of extra cash on me and asked me to spot her. I declined, saying I refused to help someone who spent the majority of the outing insulting me. \n\nThat's when everyone started arguing because literally no one else had a cent to spare but me. They said I was being \"selfish\" since I was the one who was most well off in the group. I said we had all made an agreement about how we would handle the bill and it wasn't my fault she didn't have enough money. I paid my bill and left when the Uber I had called during the fuss arrived. \n\nWhen I got home, I saw that I had been kicked out of the group chat we used to plan outings, and no one would return my calls asking why I had been expelled. That's when I figured the bill thing was the reason for it.
