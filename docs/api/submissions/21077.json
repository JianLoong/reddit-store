We apologized to one another sometime around the start of high school and I accepted hers because since I had grown out of that behavior, I figured she had, too, and really, what child *wasn't* terrible in MS? I quickly realized this couldn't have been further from the truth when she slid back into her old habits soon after. I steered clear of her for the remainder of high school career; we never had any classes together and up until the day of the incident, I hadn't known she was friends with Layla.\n\nMy acquaintances and I aren't close, so I don't fault that one person for inviting Kate.

I told her that was disrespectful and to mind her own business. She said she was \"just joking\". \n\nWe all intended on paying for our own meals when the separate bill came around. But Kate realized she had overspent by about $40 dollars and asked if she could borrow some cash from one of us. The thing was, most of my acquaintances had bought only enough for their own meals and maybe a ride home. The person who invited Kate was able to loan her $5 and another, $10. I had mentioned going shopping after we ate, so the group knew I had quite a bit of extra cash on me and asked me to spot her. I declined, saying I refused to help someone who spent the majority of the outing insulting me. \n\nThat's when everyone started arguing because literally no one else had a cent to spare but me. They said I was being \"selfish\" since I was the one who was most well off in the group. I said we had all made an agreement about how we would handle the bill and it wasn't my fault she didn't have enough money. I paid my bill and left when the Uber I had called during the fuss arrived. \n\nWhen I got home, I saw that I had been kicked out of the group chat we used to plan outings, and no one would return my calls asking why I had been expelled.

Plus you also were hella rude to me too this whole time, so even if I didn't need what I have left, I still wouldn't cover you and reward how you treated me. Your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency for me, and you don't just accidentally overspend by $40 - that's a lot of money for one individual to 'overspend'.\"\n\nNTA - they're acting totally classless and they are not your friends. You've all now graduated high school, but clearly they're still carrying the mentality. You dodged a bullet - adults who act like this don't get far.", "NTA and honestly no great loss - the odds you will remain in contact with these people as you progress in life is slim to none. Why would you want to anyway when they condoned Kate's behavior and her bullying?", "NTA and do you really think she would have payed you back!?! Be for real.\nAlso - adult move here. No one is entitled to your money, and REAL friends would not ask or assume to be able to spend your money for you.", "NTA. You're never obligated to help a person who hurt you.", "NTA. Get new friends", "NTA at all. First thing - you're probably better off without them. But it did JUST happen so I wonder if they'll take some time to realize it's extremely weird to overspend by $40 when you're broke.\n\n They're probably only incensed cuz they were being \"nice\" to her despite their budgets and don't know your history with her and that made them think you're the bad guy.\n\nIf they do calm down and YOU choose to explain your side of things, you can make it clear that if it was any of them you wouldn't have thought twice. Make it clear that woman is the problem and a bully. But only if you're interested.\n\nI suggest not contacting them and let them come to you. You did nothing wrong and have no reason to be trying to get them to be your friend.", "NTA but you need to tell your friends your background with Kate if you want them back. Without that context, it does seem like an asshole move", "NTA - $40 isn't \"a few bucks\"\n\n\nShe's the one who hasn't grown since middle school", "NTA and those aren\u2019t friends.", "NTA These people are not your friends if they side with the bully", "NTA - you didn't owe her or anyone anything", "NTA.  You aren\u2019t obligated to loan (let\u2019s be honest, likely GIVE) anyone money, ever.  \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.  Let her wash dishes or call a parent to come bail her out", "Nobody \"accidentally\" overspends by $40.  She knew exactly what she was doing and was expecting everyone else to chip in to pay.  You said NO and that is okay, your money, your decision.  Kate has been a bully to you your whole life so you shouldn't have given her a dime.  Since your friend group expelled you so quickly, you found out they aren't your real friends after all.  NTA", "Fuck no NTA. So what if you did or didn\u2019t have the ability to spot her; she spent the most of the time insulting you.  The rest of those women are not/ were not your friends either. I\u2019m sorry. They did you a favor op. WHO THE FUCk would pay for her after being insulted like that?", "NTA if you do get a chance to reply thank your friends for the nice time out and meal.

Today it\u2019s a $40 meal, next year it\u2019s a baby gift or covering a hotel for a group vacay and just because this woman acts like a child doesn\u2019t mean you have to care for her like one. \n\nAlso NONE of your other friends had more than $10 to spare? Give up the restaurants and have a potluck ffs.", "NTA, but your \"friends\" are a bunch of toxic assholes who prefer to defend a bully rather then act like decent human beings.  Find some real friends who will stand with you and shoot down that \"it's just a joke\" bullshit.  There are quite a few ways, though my personal favorite is \"Then explain how it's funny\"", "Does no one have Venmo? Not sure where you\u2019re from. This is her fault, not yours. NTA", "NTA- look at this situation as a blessing. You are ARE wiser and more mature than those acquaintances. You\u2019ll be better off. Good for you for standing your ground.

You\u2019ll meet much better people. Congratulations on your graduation!", "NTA. You acted very adult in this situation in my opinion. As women, we are taught to suck it up, apologize for everything , and always forgive . You were with someone who is continuously cruel to you and you stuck to your guns even with everyone peer pressuring you . You are incredible . This sort of strength is what it takes to be your own person regardless of the idiotic things people around you are doing . You do not need to tolerate or help anyone who is abusive towards you . \n\nI also commend you for calling her out the second she made a comment . I would t have had the balls when I was 18 to do that . Please get a new group of friends, and do not conform to be like these loser acquaintances . The fact that none of them stuck up for you when she was openly bullying you is telling .", "NTA. Get better friends. Good riddance to bad rubbish.\n\n Also who overspends on a meal by $40? Kate was planning on sticking others with the bill. You never would have seen that money again, and your so-called friends wouldn't have covered the loss either.", "Clearly Kate should have paid more attention in high school math class instead of bullying you. That way, she might have been able to add up the cost of her food before the bill came. \n\nAlso: NTA", "Nta why would you want to be friends with a group of girls who let you be insulted? Trash took itself out", "NTA and good riddance, those assholes could have said something about her rude behaviour but chose to stay silent and then had the gall to demand money from you, F them all", "NTA at all! First off, congratulations!!! Secondly, Kate needs to know the term \"reaping what you sow.\" She was beyond disrespectful and she deserved it. It's not your fault that she didn't have enough money.", "What kind of friend group has a hive mind over who's the most well off and assumes the privilege of your wealth as an accessory they feel that have a right to at any given time and if you don't comply you're selfish? \n\nNope, none of that. \n\nI also don't get how fully grown adults can accidentally \"overspend\", like where is their personal responsibility and forethought? Sounds like a copout to me of someone who thought they could rip some well intending people off. \n\nNTA OP, consider this dis invitation from the group a good thing.", "NTA find new friends.  I hope they see this too yall are extreme AH and you should have let your friend make a decision on her money.\n\nPs if yall do see this can we be friends and go out to eat \ud83d\ude0b lol I promise I'll bring some money.", "NTA\n\nI'm old enough to be your grandmother, and it is a good thing they kicked you from those groups.\n\nTrue friends would have asked, listener, understood and accepted why you refused to cover Kate. It sounds as if not a single one of them did so. This was them showing you who they truly are, which is how you label them \"acquaintances\". You have lost nothing that can't be easily replaced with very little effort and openness.\n\nTo be so very blunt, Fuck Kate and Fuck them. You did precisely what you should have done to show you have the self respect and self confidence to demand respect from your peers. Good job, kiddo.", "So as a parent if my kid rang/text me and said mum I\u2019m short $40 bucks because I miscalculated the cost of a meal - I would straight away send them $100 to make sure they are covered. Why didn\u2019t she just reach out to her parents to help her quietly so it could be sorted? \n\nNTA - I think it\u2019s lovely some of her friends there did want to help her but unfortunately couldn\u2019t, so she should have relied on family.", "NTA. Although, she could very well have gotten the cops called and charged with theft if literally nobody else could help her. Thats kind of a harsh punishment for making some rude comments. That doesnt mean its your responsibility to prevent it.\n\nI saw in the comments you said there were 7 other people there? And only one had 5 and another 10? I call bullshit. Nobody had a debit card? And everyone just so happened to bring just enough cash for a place where its at least roughly 40 per person? Smells like shit to me.

Fuck that, that aint real friends.", "Clearly they have shown that you lost nothing of value when they kicked you out. NTA.", "NTA and even if you had agreed to this beforehand you still wouldn\u2019t be the asshole.

I said no cause he\u2019s not my atm, I mean if I was desperate like I got fired and needed funds for rent or a car accident, I would have asked him for help. But just to go hang, um no! Now I didn\u2019t have much cash on me during one lunch date with her, but I looked at the menu figured out what I could pay including tax and tip. She orders and then her credit card is declined!
