One of them, \"Layla\", brought along a friend of theirs without consulting the rest of the group, something I wouldn't have minded had it been literally any other person than the one she invited. \n\n\"Kate\" used to bully me in middle school because of my very slender stature, amongst other things. I was a bit of an ugly duckling back then and rather tomboyish. She went out of her way to make snide comments about me whenever the chance arose. I wasn't entirely innocent, though, as I did the same in retaliation. We apologized to one another sometime around the start of high school and I accepted hers because since I had grown out of that behavior, I figured she had, too, and really, what child *wasn't* terrible in MS? I quickly realized this couldn't have been further from the truth when she slid back into her old habits soon after. I steered clear of her for the remainder of high school career; we never had any classes together and up until the day of the incident, I hadn't known she was friends with Layla.\n\nMy acquaintances and I aren't close, so I don't fault that one person for inviting Kate. Idk if she knew our history. Despite my displeasure, I treated Kate same as everyone else. Unfortunately, she didn't extend the same courtesy. She made a point of remarking that \"I hadn't grown since middle school\" sometime around when we first entered the restaurant and she poked fun at the size of the dish I ordered. When I returned from the bathroom after touching up my lip gloss at the end of my meal, she asked if I \"had flushed good and needed a breath mint\". I told her that was disrespectful and to mind her own business. She said she was \"just joking\". \n\nWe all intended on paying for our own meals when the separate bill came around. But Kate realized she had overspent by about $40 dollars and asked if she could borrow some cash from one of us. The thing was, most of my acquaintances had bought only enough for their own meals and maybe a ride home. The person who invited Kate was able to loan her $5 and another, $10. I had mentioned going shopping after we ate, so the group knew I had quite a bit of extra cash on me and asked me to spot her. I declined, saying I refused to help someone who spent the majority of the outing insulting me. \n\nThat's when everyone started arguing because literally no one else had a cent to spare but me. They said I was being \"selfish\" since I was the one who was most well off in the group. I said we had all made an agreement about how we would handle the bill and it wasn't my fault she didn't have enough money. I paid my bill and left when the Uber I had called during the fuss arrived. \n\nWhen I got home, I saw that I had been kicked out of the group chat we used to plan outings, and no one would return my calls asking why I had been expelled. That's when I figured the bill thing was the reason for it.

Also no one overspends by $40 accidentally.", "NTA. And honestly one day you'll look back at this group and think thank god they stopped talking to me, because if that's who they're going to side with, then they aren't real friends. I would have done the same thing. It's simple. Don't go insulting people and pushing their buttons then ask them favours lol", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t even fathom a situation in which this would be acceptable. You don\u2019t owe anyone else anything, especially someone who bullies you. She knew what she was doing especially when she spends an additional $40 she doesn\u2019t have. You will see that the friends you have in high school more than likely won\u2019t be in your life in ten yours. You\u2019re better off now that this happened early on.", "Was this really a loss? Anyone that expects you to pay for another especially after being insulted is not really a friend in my book. Plus who doesn\u2019t carry a little extra cash on an outing? NTA", "And people get but hurt when I say \"Bullies never change\". It's pretty obvious Kate hasn't.  And as such, I do not see how you are the AH for not wanting to pay for her meal after the way she acted. \n\nYou have to be super entitled to think someone should pay for your meal, after you insult them. \n\nOP, you are NTA  and you may want to find another friend group.", "NTA\n\nblock them all and never look back and get better friends", "NTA. first of all, no one is obligated to YOUR money. i hate to say this, but these people aren\u2019t your friends. your feelings and morals aren\u2019t valid around them, especially if they\u2019re going to defend a nasty bully and call you selfish for how you spend your own cash.", "NTA. So\u2026none of that gang had cash to loan the woman who deliberately overspent and none of them had a credit card? Sounds dubious to me, almost like a set up", "NTA - 18 Now it's time to learn how to spend within your budget. Not really sure how she accidentally spent 40 over what she had. Besides this a first lesson as an adult for you to help you decide in future situations is to never lend money with the expectation of it returning. I don't lend friends money. I will \"give\" them money if needed as they would do the same for me but I have no expectation of it being returned.", "NTA and your friend group sounds really immature. Its possible they thought you were overreacting because they don't know your history with her, but common sense and good manners suggest asking before you kick a friend out of the group.", "NTA - These people are lame.", "You're NTA. Kate must be from some strange parallel universe if she thinks it's acceptable to repeatedly insult someone then beg for money from the person she insulted. \n\nYour so called friend can pound sand. You're better off without them.", "NTA \n\nyou won\u2019t miss this group of people, in a year you\u2019ll look back on it and think \u201cwhy was i ever friends with them?\u201d unsure if you plan on going to college, going into a trade, etc. but you\u2019ll find much better friends who are much more mature and don\u2019t try to guilt you into paying for someone who insulted you the entire dinner. \n\nbtw, kate wasn\u2019t ever going to pay you back the loan if you had indeed covered the rest of her bill. she came to this gathering with the intention of overspending and making others pay for her.", "NTA. They have shown they don\u2019t understand the impact of bullying and they are not your friends. You do you. You don\u2019t need these frenemies in your life.  Kate probably cried and made up stories about you. Screw them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
