I always called Rick first to see if the family has any plan with Amy, but Rick and his wife hardly say no. Lately I notice that they try to ask if I can take Kate with me on these outings as well, but I always tell them no, as Kate is too young to enjoy most of our activities (salons, cooking classes, candle making etc.).\n\nAmy was to stay over at my house last Saturday because we would be looking at some summer activities together on Sunday. When I went to pick her up, Rick and his wife asked me if Kate could stay the night with me. Rick\u2019s SIL was breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 and needed their support. The wedding was like 2 weeks away and Rick\u2019s wife was a bridesmaid, so there was a lot she needed to do. They said they would be back to pick the kids up on Sunday night.\n\nI told them no. I have no experience babysitting anyone that young by myself. I never even babysit Amy at 4! I said I don\u2019t have a problem extending Amy\u2019s stay, but I really can\u2019t take Kate.\n\nRick was upset and said that Kate is Amy\u2019s sister and thus my niece as well and I have been playing favorites long enough.

Is there room for developing closeness with them as a family unit, or is it too hurtful to spend much time around Rick? I don\u2019t think anyone could fault you if that were the case.

I think Rick calling you an A-H was too far, and hopefully he'll apologize.  It sounds like parents were stressed.  But I think Rick's larger point that you are causing some drama in their family by leaving Kate out this frequently is also valid.  Of course that's going to hurt Kate's feelings, and every time you take Amy for something special, parents have to explain to a heartbroken four year old why Amy has a special aunt and she doesn't.  That's probably painful for Rick as well, but for Amy's sake, he's been dealing with it.  \n\nLook at it this way: you now have a chance to be a great aunt to two nieces, even if one is not biologically related to you.  No obligation certainly, but finding some time to include Kate would be the kind thing to do.  Maybe you and Amy can teach her how to make candles or bake cookies together?", "YTA I think you need you need to stay in their good graces because you have no legal right to see Amy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How many things in your house are fine with Amy, who's old enough to know better, but dangerous for Kate? How well secured are those things? Do you know how high Kate can reach, how good she is at turning doorknobs, if she likes to leave the house without telling anyone? Can you kate-proof your home with no warning, while trying to watch Kate? Even if Amy helped while you moved all the breakables and anything chemical, it's a situation that would almost guarantee you missed something.

With girls and all their drama - it seems more complicated judging from my friends who are moms of girls that age - they seem to need even more time with their moms.

She\u2019s not in an orphanage and Aunt Throwaway is visiting her every week but she can\u2019t adopt her. Amy has a nuclear family. Just because it\u2019s blended doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not. Aunt Throwaway is extended family, and yes, she provides a different kind of support and information than Amy\u2019s dad and stepmom, but there are plenty of children who grow up in a blended family and don\u2019t have any contact with the other side of biological family.", "Also, I did **not** deem OP an AH.

But again, having been the Kate in what I think is a somewhat comparable situation, Kate is going to be resentful towards not only Aunt Throwaway, but also of Amy. Aunt Throwaway might be preserving her relationship with Amy, but she\u2019s damaging Amy\u2019s relationship with Kate.

Kate may resent Amy, but Amy will be busy with her teen years and then off to college or work by the time Kate is going through puberty so it doubtful that their relationship would be that close. Also it would be weird for Kate, who has her father and mother, plus a stepfather, to be jealous of Amy who has her father, a stepmother and just an aunt with no maternal extended family.

Also, thinking of my own family - if my sister passed away, and my BIL remarried, I would keep in contact with my nieces and try to take up at least part of my sister\u2019s role. Unless I knew her before and liked her personally, I wouldn\u2019t have any relationship with a new wife or any children she would come into the marriage with.

Things that both girls would enjoy.\n\nMy older adoptive sister is 18 years older than me. I was more her daughter than I was her sister, so yes, we had a different relationship than most sisters, but because she was my sister and not my mom I went to her as I got older and wanted to talk about sex or whatever. We hung out all the time, we were really close until she got married. You can\u2019t assume they won\u2019t have a close relationship.

This idea of separation and extended family being no more than acquaintances is depressing. \n\nWhy does the 4 year old need to know oh no, that\u2019s not YOUR aunt.

Yes, I would send gifts, that\u2019s an easy thing to do, it is only money. Time and energy are what is in short supply.
