I was, therefore, doing everything I could to maintain contact with her and Amy even though I went to college half way across the country and after that took a job overseas. After my sister\u2019s passing I regularly call and text Amy, letting her know I\u2019m there for her. We are very close and she tells me a lot of things going on in her life and asks me for all kinds of advice which I am only happy to help.\n\nAlmost a year ago my job relocated me to a city under an hour away from where Rick and Amy live. It is a promotion of sorts so my hours are more flexible. I often drop by to see Amy and take her shopping or go to places we want to go, usually once a week. I always called Rick first to see if the family has any plan with Amy, but Rick and his wife hardly say no. Lately I notice that they try to ask if I can take Kate with me on these outings as well, but I always tell them no, as Kate is too young to enjoy most of our activities (salons, cooking classes, candle making etc.).\n\nAmy was to stay over at my house last Saturday because we would be looking at some summer activities together on Sunday. When I went to pick her up, Rick and his wife asked me if Kate could stay the night with me. Rick\u2019s SIL was breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 and needed their support. The wedding was like 2 weeks away and Rick\u2019s wife was a bridesmaid, so there was a lot she needed to do. They said they would be back to pick the kids up on Sunday night.\n\nI told them no. I have no experience babysitting anyone that young by myself. I never even babysit Amy at 4! I said I don\u2019t have a problem extending Amy\u2019s stay, but I really can\u2019t take Kate.\n\nRick was upset and said that Kate is Amy\u2019s sister and thus my niece as well and I have been playing favorites long enough. His wife said that the kids really need their aunt right now.\n\nI stood firm and insisted on only taking Amy with me, as planned. They tried to tell me Kate is well behaved and they had all her things packed so it would be easy for me. I said they had a choice of letting Amy come with me or not, but I wouldn\u2019t babysit Kate, end of discussion.\n\nI eventually took Amy but Rick called me AH for not helping out Amy\u2019s familyI wonder if they were right and I was the AH.", "created_utc": 1686156145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143i7md/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_nieces_stepsister/", "score": 259, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like Rick still thinks of you as a sister and wants to have you be part of their lives as a family, not just as part of Amy\u2019s life. Is there room for developing closeness with them as a family unit, or is it too hurtful to spend much time around Rick? I don\u2019t think anyone could fault you if that were the case. If there\u2019s room for them, it does seem like they want you there.\n\nEdit: typo", "NAH.  I think that their request was reasonable, and your refusal was also reasonable.  I think Rick calling you an A-H was too far, and hopefully he'll apologize.  It sounds like parents were stressed.  But I think Rick's larger point that you are causing some drama in their family by leaving Kate out this frequently is also valid.  Of course that's going to hurt Kate's feelings, and every time you take Amy for something special, parents have to explain to a heartbroken four year old why Amy has a special aunt and she doesn't.  That's probably painful for Rick as well, but for Amy's sake, he's been dealing with it.  \n\nLook at it this way: you now have a chance to be a great aunt to two nieces, even if one is not biologically related to you.  No obligation certainly, but finding some time to include Kate would be the kind thing to do.  Maybe you and Amy can teach her how to make candles or bake cookies together?", "YTA I think you need you need to stay in their good graces because you have no legal right to see Amy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How many things in your house are fine with Amy, who's old enough to know better, but dangerous for Kate? How well secured are those things? Do you know how high Kate can reach, how good she is at turning doorknobs, if she likes to leave the house without telling anyone? Can you kate-proof your home with no warning, while trying to watch Kate? Even if Amy helped while you moved all the breakables and anything chemical, it's a situation that would almost guarantee you missed something. If you were lucky Kate might not find whatever gets left within her reach, but it's too strong a possibility when the alternative is just that she stays home. Those are things that you might make work if it was a serious emergency, but they aren't worth it for this. And on top of that I don't know that I but that they NEED Kate gone for this.
