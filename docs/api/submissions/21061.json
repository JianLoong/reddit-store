He told us last night that he wanted to be at work a couple hours early so he can start prepping for the day, he works at a restaurant. He wanted us to pick him up at 7am instead of 9am, so we told him to be ready at 7 even though we didn't want to be up at that time ( I work night shift and my sister cooks for a college cafeteria ). We go to pick him up and he's not even awake, so we try for 40 minutes to wake him up but he's dead asleep, so we go back home to go to back to sleep and he calls us at 9 asking where are we and idk if it's the lack of sleep but we both snap at him. We told him that he'll need to find a new way to work, cause we're both tired and my sister needs to get ready for her own job.
