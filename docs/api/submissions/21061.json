You were there at 7 but he was still IN BED.  \n\n3. So since HE failed to set an alarm, it\u2019s YOUR FAULT he was late?  \n\nNOPE.

Subway? Tram? Cable train? Flying umbrella? There are literally a hundred ways a fully functioning adult can reach his work place that do not include dragging his kids out of bed after a night shift.
