Years of research and meeting professionals discussing how the brain and body\u2019s reaction to events cause PTSD. I\u2019ve tried talk therapy, group therapy, EMDR, DBT, TRE, yoga, running \u2026. Not one of those things fixed me. It took almost all of them. My maintenance is TRE, yoga, and weight lifting. Talk therapy did the opposite for me than it\u2019s designed for. Until you try to find a solution or solutions that work for you, the cycle will continue. You can never remove or break the cycle but you can learn to adjust reactions and that can lead to what feels like a new lease on life. \n\nYTA for how you reacted.

Perhaps you should post in another sub this same scenario but with a focus on how can I help support my daughter?

There isn't enough information to tell what the flood actually was like, but if it was just property damage and you had to move, then I struggle to see that rising to the level of trauma.

If your child comes up and says they think they broke their arm you wouldn't laugh in their face, so why are mental health concerns taken lightly? Just because a child hasn't lived as long as their parents or had as many experiences doesn't mean they can't have mental illness.

Such as someone with astraphobia having her sanctuary (like her home) flooded by a thunderstorm. PTSD very rarely manifests immediately, either.

She will begin to distrust her own intuitions, and she will later doubt every feeling she has. This will happen on a subconscious level, without her even realizing it. This is because you (as her protector) have dismissed her fears and thus, you have inadvertently taught her that SHE can't trust herself. This sort of thing impacts adults all the time, and it is part of how C-PTSD can manifest.\n\n2.)

Get her to a therapist and/or psychologist to determine if she does/does not have it; and work through issues of both traumatic events of her home flooding and having you as a parent. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Good lord, come on. First of all, PTSD has some pretty specific parameters in terms of clinical diagnosis, but the term is used extensively in normal conversation to mean a variety of things. Generally people truly develop PTSD as a result of doing something (negative) themselves they did not believe they were capable of, or witnessing someone close to them do something similar. It causes a collapse of virtually everything a person believes they know about themselves or someone close to them, and subsequently a collapse of what is built on top of it. This is generally not the case when people use it in passing, of course. Without knowing more of her life story it would be hard to determine how accurate that description is here, but let\u2019s assume for a moment she doesn\u2019t truly have PTSD. She had an existing fear of thunderstorms prior to this flood. \nHer apparent growing out of the fear was likely not that at all. She was forced to confront something she was very afraid of- it went from a vague but terrifying possibility to a visible and destructive reality, but you also all made it out alive. In some ways an experience like that can be oddly comforting. Especially for a child it is very hard to know relative level of risk, and different children process this differently. Some children almost have a binary representation of fear where things are either scary or not, but scary means SCARY. Like life and death scary. An experience which shows that there are levels of things to fear can help in that way.\nInstead of splitting hairs about the term she is using, maybe just listen to the fact that she is scared and don\u2019t add on top of that fear the worry that her mom doesn\u2019t care about it. An impression like that, especially if you dig in and insist your response was right, can last the rest of a person\u2019s life and create all kinds of other issues. The reality\nIs there are plenty of people and places in the world which should not be trusted, and a child may reasonably assume that most people should be viewed with a little of suspicion either for physical or emotional safety, or both. You really don\u2019t want her to decide that ALL people should be viewed that way, and when a child feels like not even their parents can be trusted for emotional safety that is where it leads.", "YTA\n\n\u2018None of us have PTSD\u2019\n\nPTSD is a disorder that occurs on a subjective basis - something that may give some PTSD might not give someone else that same PTSD. Just in case you\u2019re double stupid, it isn\u2019t genetic either.\n\nShe probably is having a problem understanding and expressing her emotions, especially since her mother does nothing but laugh at her when she is clearly in distress.\n\nI just cut off my mother for invalidating my boundaries and PTSD - this couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Apologise to her and consider therapy (even books about fears, etc. if it\u2019s something not financially applicable).", "Are you a specialist dealing with childhood ptsd? No. Should you mock your child\u2019s feelings? No. Are you the asshole? Big ole yes", "You literally did laugh at your daughter for reaching out.\nShe sought help from you. The person she's supposed to trust the most.\nAnd you laughed in her face.\n\nYou better get her to a therapist before she hits 18 and goes NC because I am SURE this isn't the first or last time you've invalidated her and told her how little SHE knows about HER feelings.", "YTA,\n\nBeing afraid of storms to begin with then have your house flooded can reinforce those fears as well as her being fine, I'm thinking she was in shock or repressing it some how. I'm not a psychologist/counselor so I don't know.

Girl if you were my friend I would call you out so bad on that one.\n\nApologize to your daughter for being dismissive of her feelings and ask her would she like to talk to someone about her fears.

She was like that\u2019s odd but okay and took me to the doctor where I was diagnosed with shingles! Spent like a week out of school because of it. It\u2019s important when concerns are validated. Imagine if she had been like no, and I just gave the entire school chickenpox or something.", ">To be fair though, I actually like my kid\n\nGod bless you for this. My parents (and step-parent) were all pretty up front and honest about how much they didn't (and probably don't) like me, but that they \"had to\" love me. It .... definitely fucked me up a bit. \n\nI'm glad you like your kid.", "I am 43 and just recently got over the trauma of a robbery that happened while we were on vacation. Until this age I had night terrors where people were breaking in and I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop them. \n\nI was maybe 9 when this incident occurred and it haunted me for 35 years. Better take your daughter seriously because like post I\u2019m replying to, I am currently no contact with my mom. Not just for this but I can tell you the dismissal of the daughter\u2019s feelings is a symptom of the things that lead to NC.", "And to add she will never come and talk to her mom ever again if she thinks she needs help. \n\nYTA OP. \nGreat way to estrange your daughter.", "Anyone and anything - she'll turn to drugs or other coping mechanisms to deal with it since there's no support structure.", "Same. Like okay, cool, I\u2019m so glad to know my parents don\u2019t actually care about me and I\u2019m simply a responsibility for them.", "I have/had VCD, stress related.  Caused asthmatic symptoms and sounded like I had laryngitis.  It was from a really stressful job.  I quit and I had to forbid a friend who still worked there from talking about the place for a year after because it would give me panic attacks.  Half my hair fell out, etc.  It was awful.  I actually work there again now.  It's now a WFH position and my boss has been a snarling wildebeest keeping everyone from stressing me out.  She can't afford to have me quit again.  Honestly, just not being in the office has solved about 75% of my problems there.  Her making everyone go through her if they need my help has solved the other 25%.", "Thank you so much for that link. I've been NC with my mom for a while now and struggled to put into words to other family members why there's probably zero chance of me ever reconciling with her. It's not all the millions of things that she does wrong, it's that she doesn't even think there's anything wrong so she doesn't understand why I'm mad.", "Hey, OP, are you stupid? How dare you belittle someone else\u2019s mental health. \nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re her mum - do you live a day in her head? Walk a day in her shoes? NO!\n\nAre you a qualified psychiatrist to be able to say with certainty that your daughter does not have PTSD? \n\nWell you\u2019d better either qualify and become one or save up for one cos your daughter is going to need one! \n\nNot only are you TA, you\u2019re an absolute ignoramous!\n\nYTA", "All of this ^ Personally I know how I\u2019ve handled events in my life and I\u2019m probably so stubborn of refuse to believe I had PTSD in OP\u2019s situation. I also know for a fact that my own daughter is so much like me that she\u2019s probably react in a similar manner as I would during a crisis. That being said, has her father I would NEVER laugh at her concerns and since she could talk to me I\u2019ve most likely annoyed her with endless times of \u201care you ok? Do you want to talk? Etc\u201d because when something traumatic happens, as a parent my first job is to make sure my kids get though it the best they can. My second job is to be there for them for however long it takes for them to be ok. Even if that takes a life time. I can\u2019t imagine acting so pig headed, dismissive and relationship dividing as OP was with her daughter/ breaks my heart for that kid.", "This here. \n\nI'd like to put this in perspective though.\nMom is basically the point person in this child's life for this kid seeing a doctor. The one who makes appts and if necessary will help getting meds when the child is sick.\n\nMom/OP. Imagine you went to go to the doctor and the nurse comes in to write down what's wrong. You tell her you're in terrible abdominal pain and think it may be your appendix. However you are overweight, and the nurse just laughs at you and says it's probably from all the garbage you eat and tells you you can leave, and to come back when you have something else wrong. \n\nHow would you feel? YTA/nurse in this situation. Who knows what can be going on. Could be a ready to burst appendix, or gallstones, ibs, etc. \nPoint is you don't know. Your daughter doesn't know. You owe it to her to help her find out.\n\n\nCongratulations.", "I'm so sorry that happened to you.", "I'm a trans girl. When I was little, I used to try on my sister's dresses cause it made me feel cute.\n\nMy mom caught me doing it one day, she laughed, and then informed the rest of the family, the adults all laughed as well.\n\nDrove me deep into the closet for twelve years and I still hate her for it.", "I think a lot of times kids just know that something is wrong but they don't know what or why", "Oh man, that reminded me of a time when we went to a resort. My mom got a package to get a massage and I asked if I could as well. If she said no cause of money, I\u2019d mostly understand (though she was very hypocritical with her stance on this and would spend a lot of money on herself while we had to go without for a while, or Christmas was threatened). Anyways, her response was that I had nothing to be stressed about as a teenager. Like as if it\u2019s actually impossible for me to be stressed about anything because of my age. The whole time i kept thinking how she\u2019s the main reason for my stress. \n\nIt\u2019s either a competition or they matter way more than their own kids. Always had to put her feelings and needs before my own unless I wanted to be grounded or yelled at.", "This is my dad. A couple nights ago we were talking and I mentioned how finances and money gave me anxiety because of how stressful they were in my childhood. He told me I couldn\u2019t possibly feel anxiety about that because *he* was the one going through it. \n\nGee, my bad, your dad saying his money problems are your fault because he sent you to a private school could never cause you anxiety. Not to mention his constant anger outbursts and depression. Those were the times :)", "oh yeah for sure, my mom would constantly stress and complain to us about money too to the point I would starve myself and my brother would steal lunches from the school", "Exactly! It\u2019s science when a mom says you\u2019re fine you\u2019re not depressed you don\u2019t have PTSD! All your problems go away. \n\nFor only the cost of your self-worth and mental health, you too can be fixed by a mother!

Mothers will also point out how much they did for you if confronted. \n\nCALL NOW!", "LOL my child confided in me and i dismissed her by laughing and invalidating her feelings LOL. YTA.", "\"I am her mother so I know she doesn't have PTSD.\"\n\nHonestly, this description of your approach to parenting is triggering MY C-PTSD from having a mother who declined to get me help for any of the issues that caused my severe distress as a child. YTA", "YTA. \n\nYou're not just an asshole, but you're also a monster. Your daughter came to you to tell you something IA wrong in the best words she could, and you laughed in her face. You say that \"no one else has anything remotely like PTSD\" so she must not either? That's so silly to rule out something because of other people. You aren't a professional to diagnose her. \n\nGet her help. APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY. Listen to your children. You've probably just her trust forever.", "YTA. She may not have PTSD, but rather than laughing at her, you could sit down and talk to her and provide a safe space for her to talk.", "YTA. Are you a LCSW? Psychologist? Psychiatrist? If yes, have you actually sat down and evaluated her before laughing at her and telling her that no, it isn't PTSD?\n\nIf you *aren't* a qualified mental health professional, then you aren't any more qualified than your 14 year old to diagnose or rule out PTSD, and the label is irrelevant in this situation anyway.\n\nYour daughter opened up to you about her difficulty moving past a stressful and disruptive event in her young life. You responded by laughing at her and telling her she's wrong. There was absolutely a more constructive, compassionate, empathetic way to handle this, and I think you know that.\n\nI actually *do* have a diagnosis of delayed-onset Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. I generally do not appreciate people appropriating mental health diagnoses for trivial reasons or to demonize people they don't like. However, if somebody opened up to me about how they've been feeling about a stressful point in their life and PTSD is the best name they have for it, that's not the time to split hairs and nitpick. This person is telling me they are deeply distressed and not coping well, whether they know what to call it or not. Laughing at that is cruel.\n\nWere I you, I would be less worried about looking like an asshole and more concerned with salvaging the relationship with your daughter that you just torpedoed.", "Looking at your comments, the reaction to them speaks volumes. Hell, it *screams* them.\n\nYour daughter came to you asking for help and support. Not only did you refuse to help, you also told her she didn't know her own mind.\n\nYou gaslit her.\n\nYou minimised her lived experiences.\n\nYou dismissed her concerns.\n\nI'd normally just say YTA, but you... you're a monster.\n\nI hope she survives you.", "And an increase in difficulty around the anniversary is a classic PTSD symptom. The anniversary effect.", "RIGHT? Quite literally an animal survival response. \"We are not safe yet\"", "When she laughs in the face of her child opening up to her, that's \"parenting\". When her daughter stops talking to her because she doesn't feel emotionally safe, that's \"rude\". YTA.", "As a clinical psychologist I take peoples own definition of what they have very seriously.\nSomeone coming with symptoms and having no clue about what diagnosis those point to is of course normal. \nBut many people read up on stuff, then one thing reads like \"gosh, do those people who wrote that know me?!\" and they form a pretty good theory. People coming in saying \"I think I have depression/ptsd/anxiety/borderline/whatever\" or \"adhd/autism\" are correct very often. \n\nThe people answering \"BS, you don't!!!!\" usually are wrong though."]}
