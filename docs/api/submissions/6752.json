Years of research and meeting professionals discussing how the brain and body\u2019s reaction to events cause PTSD. I\u2019ve tried talk therapy, group therapy, EMDR, DBT, TRE, yoga, running \u2026. Not one of those things fixed me. It took almost all of them. My maintenance is TRE, yoga, and weight lifting. Talk therapy did the opposite for me than it\u2019s designed for. Until you try to find a solution or solutions that work for you, the cycle will continue. You can never remove or break the cycle but you can learn to adjust reactions and that can lead to what feels like a new lease on life. \n\nYTA for how you reacted.

Perhaps you should post in another sub this same scenario but with a focus on how can I help support my daughter?

There isn't enough information to tell what the flood actually was like, but if it was just property damage and you had to move, then I struggle to see that rising to the level of trauma.

Your daughter didn\u2019t self diagnose herself, she told you she might have it, and instead of taking it seriously and setting up therapy with someone who can diagnose it, you decide you were smarter than the docs and LAUGHED in your daughters face and told her no. Great way to ensure she never speaks to you about her mental health again. \n\nand parents wonder why their kids don\u2019t talk to them.", "Your daughter came to you with a very real problem. You laughed in her face. And you're calling her rude? You've broken her trust in you. You may never get that back.  Home disasters are very traumatic to kids, and anniversaries of these things are very hard on people.  It's completely possible, if not likely, your daughter does have PTSD. Instead of shitting on her for asking for help, you should be finding her a therapist. And she's really going to need one now that you've made it clear to her she can't talk to you about this stuff.  \n\nI grew up in a family where any kind of negative emotion was squashed. You know what I learned? Don't trust my parents with my emotions. I never had the kind of closeness with them that others had with their parents.  I couldn't trust them to have my back. Once when I was in my mid-twenties, my mom said \"I can never tell how you're feeling\" and I wanted to laugh at her (but I didn't). She spent my whole childhood telling me I couldn't have the feelings I had. I was trained up not to show her my feelings. What did she expect?", "YTA and boyyyyy did you just make a core memory for your kid. They will never trust you again. You fucked up BAD.", "YTA. It\u2019s not absurd. The idea you laugh when she is scared and trying to express it to you doesn\u2019t bode well.", "YTA. People experience the same events in different ways and you shouldn't have disregarded your daughter's feelings AND LAUGHED.

She asked for help from you and you laughed at her... Now she will be justified to never tell you anything important. Take her to a doctor.", "YTA you laughed at her telling you her feelings, the T in PTSD stands for trauma. She was trying to tell you that she felt trauma and you laughed.

Feels more likely that she\u2019s started hiding it.", "as someone with diagnosed CPTSD and has been in therapy for it for 6+ years, YTA.

Are you ready to lose your daughter because you wont take her seriously? Thats what my dad did and if it were up to me i would leave his ass to rot in a retirement home.

Want to know some of the risk factors that make it more someone will develop PTSD? A history of anxiety and one\u2019s subjective experience during the event - like being anxious about thunderstorms and then a storm actually destroying your home. And lack of social support after the event - like a mom laughing at and dismissing your feelings about the event.\n\nI don\u2019t know if she had PTSD or not, but neither do you.

Never did again.  \n...2 years later i nearly succeeded in ending my life and currently owe my continued existence to a estranged friends 'gut feeling' and a welfare call that happened because of it. \n\nDon't ignore your kids feelings, OP. thats how you close the door to their trust- and when they need you they won't reach out.", "You have done your relationship with your daughter some serious damage.

That's beyond awful. I hope she seeks therapy on her own, because Dr. Mom is not qualified.

You don't get to decide that, and I'm sure if they could just pick, they wouldn't feel the way they feel either. If anything, you've added guilt and embarrassment on top of fear to her list of troubles, and now she probably won't even feel comfortable being vulnerable enough to tell you about it.

If your kid thinks they have something, even if you *know* it's far fetched, **you listen to them and make them a doctors appointment if you can't ease their worries**. If your child comes up and says they think they broke their arm you wouldn't laugh in their face, so why are mental health concerns taken lightly? Just because a child hasn't lived as long as their parents or had as many experiences doesn't mean they can't have mental illness.

We'd have alot more well adjusted, functional adults if their parents started them on therapy as kids instead of forcing them to grin and bear it.\n\n\nLike, I'm so sorry you were blown off like that by your mom.

Then my chest felt like it was in a vince and breathing in anything but shallow breaths hurt. Agter a week like that I got an extreme constant pain in my left shoulder and down my arm. Went to the hospital only because the pain was too bad to ignore. Cue heart monitor going off on a red alarm. They had a crash cart on standby.
