I wouldn't have been able to tell you why I didn't like the idea at the time, though.\n\nAgain, not trying to project a trans identity onto her.

Ultimately, the groom chooses his groomsmen.", "Maybe let your fianc\u00e9 talk to her if it really bothers you.

It is upto bride and groom to take decision what responsibility they want her to fulfill.", "Honestly as someone who has been in 9 wedding parties as a bridesmaid or MOH if she's making this demand now, she's going to be such a PITA regardless of what side she's on.", "That's fair, when I reach back out I'll let her know, currently it's been two days since we spoke and I'm trying to figure out how to word things.", "I'll definitely ask, I really don't care what she wears, I just want her to be next to me, I consider her one of my closest friends.", "But he didn\u2019t invite her as a grooms woman.

Open by letting her know that you want her at your wedding and you want to understand what's making her uncomfortable and how you can accommodate, because -- stress it -- you value her friendship and you WANT her there, but you need to understand in order to accommodate.\n\nGood luck, and IMO, NAH. We just need communication and understanding.", "One more suggestion is to use gender neutral language like \u201cpart of my bridal party\u201d vs \u201cbridesmaids\u201d - I\u2019m sure there are more terms but it may make her more comfortable if the issue is something like she\u2019s questioning her gender identity (either trans or NB).", "I think this is exactly what you need to tell her.   I had someone on my side in a tux just like the groomsmen, and it was great.", "This ritual is not part of my culture which makes my understanding limited.

Being in the bridal party is about supporting the bride. Being a groomsman is about supporting the groom.  You asked her to support you on your wedding day, and she basically said she doesn\u2019t want to support you because she\u2019s more of a \u201cguys girl\u201d.

For the sake of keeping the peace, I went to many a shopping excursion and chocolate cake morning tea so my mate and I could go out drinking in peace. \n\nIs this person really your friend or your partner\u2019s?

I was a girl in to sports, so mostly played with guys at recess, then I was in band in the horn section, so also guys, and I had a terrible sense of humor. Plus, I had crushes on all of them. \n\nIt is also really bad taste to be like \"oh no, I'm closer to your fiance, who has not asked me to be on his side, but I want to make sure YOU know that I like your fiance more than you and would rather party with them. \n\nSo next steps, talk to your fiance, and I think you just vote her out of the wedding party entirely.

Just tell her \"I'm sorry you didn't feel close enough to me to want to be a bridesmaid, so we will just have you as a guest, so save the date!\"\n\nWhat you do with that statement is you don't leave room for conversation or compromise.  She will likely try with your fiance to talk about it more, and that's why you should just tell her together, and then don't go back and forth about it. Just pick another bridesmaid or adjust your numbers, and don't respond to text messages or further drama about it. If other people bring it up, simply say \"oh ya it's a little tricky but we love Sam, but she didn't feel comfortable being a bridesmaid. I appreciate her being honest because I would never want to drag someone through wedding stuff when they didn't want to do it.\"\n\nSee, what you keep doing here is not compromising or discussing options that don't exist, except for Sam. If my partner says \"do you want to go to the movies or to the zoo\" if I respond with \"let's go to Japan\" I am being unreasonable and making up shit that isn't an option. That is what Sam did, so just don't entertain it at all. If others- or Sam- keep asking about being a groomswoman, just say \"oh fiance already picked out his party and let's not keep talking about it because I don't want to make this even more awkward.\"\n\nOh and your fiance and you need to agree that this is the hill you die on.
