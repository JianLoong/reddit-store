I wouldn't have been able to tell you why I didn't like the idea at the time, though.\n\nAgain, not trying to project a trans identity onto her.

Ultimately, the groom chooses his groomsmen.", "Maybe let your fianc\u00e9 talk to her if it really bothers you.

It is upto bride and groom to take decision what responsibility they want her to fulfill.", "Honestly as someone who has been in 9 wedding parties as a bridesmaid or MOH if she's making this demand now, she's going to be such a PITA regardless of what side she's on.", "That's fair, when I reach back out I'll let her know, currently it's been two days since we spoke and I'm trying to figure out how to word things.", "I'll definitely ask, I really don't care what she wears, I just want her to be next to me, I consider her one of my closest friends.", "But he didn\u2019t invite her as a grooms woman.

Open by letting her know that you want her at your wedding and you want to understand what's making her uncomfortable and how you can accommodate, because -- stress it -- you value her friendship and you WANT her there, but you need to understand in order to accommodate.\n\nGood luck, and IMO, NAH. We just need communication and understanding.", "One more suggestion is to use gender neutral language like \u201cpart of my bridal party\u201d vs \u201cbridesmaids\u201d - I\u2019m sure there are more terms but it may make her more comfortable if the issue is something like she\u2019s questioning her gender identity (either trans or NB).", "I think this is exactly what you need to tell her.   I had someone on my side in a tux just like the groomsmen, and it was great.", "This ritual is not part of my culture which makes my understanding limited.
