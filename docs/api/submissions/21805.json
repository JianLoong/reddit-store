Did you say couples counseling? Then you go to counseling. Did you say divorce? Call a lawyer", "NTA. You had boundaries set and he wanted to ignore them. As you said, Uber and Lyft do exist. His marriage should take precedence over possibly getting heckled by his friend imho", "He faced the age old quandary: do I betray my wife or put up with my buddies calling me whipped?  He did not choose wisely.  This is why there\u2019s a doghouse for husbands to be in.  NTA", "This is not a tough one. You didn\u2019t ruin it. The men who felt comfortable with borderline (or more) lying and cheating on their spouses ruined it. NTA.", "You had a very good reason not to be on board with this--and your husband knows exactly why--yet he went ahead and did the one thing you *both* agreed he would not do again?\n\nNTA. That's a total breach of trust.", "NTA the person who broke the trust does not get to dictate how or when the trust is restored. You gave him the boundaries you needed him to maintain, and he needs to follow them. I\u2019m assuming these boundaries were put in place in order for you to feel comfortable in continuing the relationship, so you need to remind him of that and what is at stake.", "NTA. Sounds like you set clear boundaries based in his previous indiscretions, that he\u2019d agreed to. He should hold himself accountable and excuse himself from the party. You didn\u2019t ruin anything\u2026his previous decisions did.", "Personally I think NTA.\n\nYou set up a clear boundary about him not going to a strip club. Especially since that\u2019s how he cheated previously.\n\nI can understand him wanting you to trust him but he broke that trust first when he cheated. He needs to earn his trust back if he actually cares about you and the relationship and if that means not going to the strip club for the foreseeable future, or ever, than that is his penance\n\nTbh it sounds like he\u2019s more concerned about his friends\u2019 feelings than he is yours. \n\nI am curious though, do you find it exhausting having to babysit him? I can understand and empathize with why you would but it just seems like so much extra effort on your part, especially since you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "The fact that this situation cause issues in your relationship previously is a good excuse not to be particularly comfortable with opening the door again. He should have understood this. NTA", "NTA. You both set clear boundaries and he decided to push those boundaries. He had options. Instead, he chose to blame you and then yell at you for hours. That\u2019s unacceptable. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to say, \u201cSorry guys I can\u2019t go to the next destination. Would you like me to call an Uber?\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter if the guys are heckling him. He could own up to why he couldn\u2019t go, or simply say no and not offer a reason.", "NTA maybe you should consider divorce.", "NTA. \nThe audacity to even ask you to go to a strip club after what happened last time is well, not at all shocking considering his past stunt but certainly way overstepping. \nKing Baby really thinks he should get everything he wants doesn't he? The entitlement of this grown infant you have to babysit because he can't prioritize properly, respect your feelings, control himself like an adult who has made agreements. \nTo then come home and deflect his guilt (he brought ALL of this upon himself and is lucky you are still putting up with his ass) by subjecting you to HOURS OF YELLING is completely beyond. \nAnd now here come the labels! You're \"untrusting\"! Controlling! Emasculating! A nag! No fun! Party pooper! Why can't you be like the other COOL WIVES, amirite??? \nOf course you are exactly correct - he could have left at any time, the guys could have hired a car. And it would have proven his dedication to restoring your trust and his maturity about it all, but instead diaper baby threw a huge tanty and kicked and screamed at you for hours for..  *checks notes* expecting him to follow through on his promises. \nDo NOT back down one inch, OP. Don't let him bully you or backfoot you into defending your lack of trust. This is manipulative, childish, and deeply troubling behavior that shows his utter lack of remorse and understanding at what he did to cause the problem. \nYou really might be looking at the beginning of the end here I am sorry to say. \nThis is not about the party it's about how he handled the situation: his communication, his attitude, his disrespect, his verbal abuse. \nInsist on counseling with someone who specializes in infidelity and if he won't comply and make an effort to grow, he's worthless to you as a partner.", "Eesh, NTA.  You both agreed to the conditions of you working through that bad time and remaining together.  Turns out he just meant \"I promise I won't do it unless there comes a time when I want to do it\".  Apparently your feelings are worth less than the boys' entertainment, and him wanting to save face.", "NTA. Your husband prioritized his friends over you. He cared more about saving face with them than your marriage. You\u2019ve already worked through one stripper cheating incident and he\u2019s an ass for going into a club again.", "I mean you aren't the asshole but why even bother trying to continue the marriage if you have to keep him on a leash & threaten to tell his friends on him if he gets out of line. Just sounds like you'd be happier without him and he'd be happier without you.", "Was ready to jump down your throat but given the context/his past nta.", "That's a tough one! It sounds like your husband was in a difficult situation and you were trying to look out for him. It's understandable that you would be worried about him going to a strip club after what happened last year, and you were trying to protect him from getting into a similar situation again. It's also understandable that he would be frustrated with you for not trusting him, but it's important to remember that trust is earned. Ultimately, it sounds like you were trying to do the right thing and it didn't go as planned, so I don't think you're the AITA here.", "NTA. The two of you are married. By definition, marriage means restrictions on behavior. His desire to go to a strip club with his guy friends is understandable. His priority must be his marriage. \"I don't get to do whatever I want\" is just part of being a grownup.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Other options for trip ups like this were seperation and counseling.", "Plus - cheating with a stripper closes the door on going to a strip club ever again, which is eventually going to include some uncomfortable conversations with your dude friends.  These are the life choices he made and the consequences of them.  There are plenty of couples in the world that agree no strippers on either side, if your friends can't deal with that without heckling they are toxic friends that sound like they would encourage cheating.", "He did at least ask me- he could have said nothing and Id be none the wiser.

You don\u2019t actually say, i more assumed, but when he went silent it was because they did end up going to the strip club right? \nIf so, no he didn\u2019t do anything right, he pretended to, probably thinking you\u2019d cave and give him a pat on the head and tell him how great he was for being honest.

That's why when it first happened,  I told him specifically I was not his accountability partner cause I didn't want to hover and check his phone or worry about it.
