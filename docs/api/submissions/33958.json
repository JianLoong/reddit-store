Your dad left it for you. Tell her go kick rocks.", "NTA. Why are you even still talking to this person? She\u2019s nothing to you now since your dad passed away. What she thinks, feels, or eats for breakfast in the morning, none of it need concern you anymore.", "NTA, but maybe get a lawyer to send her a letter telling her in legal terms, to go kick rocks and to not contact you again.", "NTA.  If your father wants to leave something to his girlfriend, he could have done so in his will.  It is your money and I understand your father wants the money to be in the hands of his bloodline instead of some gold digger.  I am surprised your father's girlfriend did not dig enough gold out of your father for all 20 years?", "NTA\n\n\nChoices were made by your Dad and his new gf. She could have been nice to you and made an effort to have a good relationship with you. And your Dad chose to give you his money and not her.", "NTA - your father left it to you for a reason. Now, maaaybe he just forgot to update things, but if he told you personally, then it was on purpose. There's a reason she wasn't given it.\n\nWould it be nice of you to give it to her - or even some - it sure would. Saintly, in my book. You're N TA for keeping it though. Why would you just randomly hand out huge chunks of cash to a woman that didn't even like you? It's not like you had a great relationship to fall back on.\n\nHeck, I'm nicer to you than she is, so if you're gonna be tossing money around....", "NTA\n\nYour father was with his GF for 20 years.  If he had wanted to have any of his wealth to go to her after his death, he would have made some arrangements for that in the last 20 years.  The fact that you were the beneficiary of all of his accounts strongly indicates that every time your father has a choice of who to leave his money and other assets, he made an informed and deliberate choice to pick you and not his GF.\n\nYou should honor your Dad's choice and keep that money.  His GF's lack of money is the consequence of her own actions and behaviors (living off a man to whom she wasn't married for decades, choosing not to work or earn an education, being rude to you...).\n\nI recommend you talk to a few based financial planner who is a fiduciary to get advice on investing this money for long term future benefits for you and your Mom.", "You don't owe her anything. People forget that grace begets grace. As you got nothing from her, you owe her nothing in return.\n\nSet up your mum for a fantastic retirement. Go on a holiday on dear old dad. Donate some and make someone else's day. It is yours to do as you see fit. Dad had 20 years to put his gf as his beneficiary. He didn't. \nNTA.", "NTA. If he wanted her to have some of his money, then he would've or should've written a new will. Or he could've put money into accounts under her name. But he didn't. And she should've been smarter and married him instead of just living together in a non common law state. C'est la vie.", "NTA. Your dad should have changed his estate plans if he wanted her to have some. If she was nice or nurturing to you at all, I\u2019d probably give her some, but for real you owe her nothing. Sounds like you and your mom are now getting the alimony and child support you should have gotten 20 years ago. Plus compensation for emotional damages.", "NTA. If he wanted her to have it she would have been in the will. You as a person she's never once been friendly with certainly have no obligation to her.", "NTA your dad wanted you to have this money for a reason.", "NTA. That money is yours. Your post shows a great deal of resentment, though. I don't think you are a very happy person. Spend some of that money wisely. Get yourself some therapy. Please do not take offence at this suggestion. Most people could really do with some therapy in my opinion, but your father and his gf made your early life very difficult, and I think you need therapy to work through your anger and become a happier person. I like your idea of giving some of the inheritance to your mother. It is a bitter awakening for your father's gf after 20 years, but she really should have secured her position somehow. As it stands, she is not your responsibility, and I don't feel that you owe her anything. Your father apparently didn't either or he would have married her or at least left her something.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t let her see a penny. That\u2019s your dad\u2019s money left for YOU. Tell her if your dad wanted her to have that money, he would\u2019ve left it to her. He didn\u2019t. So she can very well find someone else to leech off of.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and his gf fucked around. Literally. On your mom. Now gf is in the \"find out\" phase.\n\nTake the money and give it to your mom.", "NTA - This is your inheritance. He told you this and it is legally set up to disburse to you. \n\nAfter years of abuse from your father and his GF she now wants you to gift her money. \"NO\" is a complete sentence. Hire a lawyer and direct her to s/w with them; no you. \n\nSorry for your loss. It makes most people reflect on the past and you and your mom went through difficult times....now you are both shining bright! Best to you!", "NTA. You should set up a scholarship for first gen immigrant students with this money, if you don\u2019t need/particularly want it.", "Nta if he wanted her to have it he would have changed his will. \n\nIt\u2019s payment for him being a bad dad. Enjoy the money", "NTA. If he has listed you as the beneficiary, that\u2019s the end of any discussion. If he wanted her to have it, he should have listed her. There may have been reasons that he listed you and not her that you don\u2019t know. Maybe he felt guilty about how he treated you, who knows. It doesn\u2019t matter if you need it or not. He wanted you to have it, so you get it. You can do anything you want with it, she doesn\u2019t get a say in it.", "NTA. Save and invest the money and give some to your mom - she did a hell of a job and deserves a nice treat for raising you on her own and putting herself through school. She\u2019s the real MVP.", "NTA. Tell her to take it up with him. It was his decision", "NTA\n\nYour father had *20 years* to marry her or change his will, he didn't.\n\nSounds like he either didn't really love her or saw that she was just using him.\n\nAlso karma catches up to all of us eventually, it's just her time now.", "NTA nope keep it and laugh all the way to the bank", "NTA. I think giving some to your mum would be a lovely gesture. I did something similar when my grandmother died. She treated my mum like shit for years, and me too because I look and act a lot like her. Received a few thousand from her as inheritance so I used it to treat my mum", "NTA however you could send her 10k a year so she doesn\u2019t starve and it would cost you nothing. Whatever her relationship with your dad he did stay with her for 20 years.", "NTA\n\nIt was left to you, it is yours to do with as you want. I like the idea of giving it to your Mum so she can have a fantastic retirement. That would be good Karma for the difficult life after your Dad left.", "Give it to who? I don't even know who that person is.    /s", "NTA and giving it to your mum would be amazing. Set it up right for her so she\u2019s taken care of properly.", "I'mma be honest, this post sounds fake.

Don\u2019t give it to anyone. Don\u2019t make promises. Don\u2019t do anything with it except hire a financial advisor with a duty to work for your benefit. Over time you can decide how to share what you want to share with the person or people you care about.", "NTA.\n\nIf your father made sure to put things in your name, and name you as his sole beneficiary, then he *chose* not to leave anything to his girlfriend. He must have had a reason for keeping her completely out of everything.", "NTA\n\nYour dad left it all to you for a reason. Those were his wishes.", "NTA. I'm wondering if Dad promised her anything and then failed to follow through. I love the idea of you giving it to your mom. She's a BOSS! Good for her for picking herself up and making something awesome while raising you guys.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t need it, give it to your mom. And if he has a house, file to evict her", "NTA. I\u2019d donate some or all to a domestic violence shelter or some other program that would help single mothers and/or troubled/at risk children.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious your father didn\u2019t want gf to have anything.", "Why care what she thinks? I wouldn't. NTA", "NTA by plan, or lack of one, dad left the estate to you.  If you open the wallet once to her it\u2019s likely that there will be repeat requests.", "NTA\n\nDo not give his girlfriend anything.\n\nIf he liked her, he would have married her years ago.", "Jeeeeeesus. That\u2019s cold. Do it", "Definitely this - healing is a wonderful thing! And  worth every penny! Put your dad\u2019s money towards that - he owes it to you!", "His mom tbe millionaire?", ">I think giving some to your mum would be a lovely gesture.\n\nIt balances the scales a little too. Give your mama a little more of a nest egg.", "He told me over and over that all his brokerage accounts and 401k had me as his beneficiary. He had nothing else of value. No property either. I believe he wanted everything to be mine.", "He didn't even need to marry her tbh. Just make a will leaving her something", "She didn't even manage to ask you nicely!"]}
