If he had wanted to have any of his wealth to go to her after his death, he would have made some arrangements for that in the last 20 years.  The fact that you were the beneficiary of all of his accounts strongly indicates that every time your father has a choice of who to leave his money and other assets, he made an informed and deliberate choice to pick you and not his GF.\n\nYou should honor your Dad's choice and keep that money.  His GF's lack of money is the consequence of her own actions and behaviors (living off a man to whom she wasn't married for decades, choosing not to work or earn an education, being rude to you...).\n\nI recommend you talk to a few based financial planner who is a fiduciary to get advice on investing this money for long term future benefits for you and your Mom.", "You don't owe her anything.

Your post shows a great deal of resentment, though. I don't think you are a very happy person. Spend some of that money wisely. Get yourself some therapy. Please do not take offence at this suggestion. Most people could really do with some therapy in my opinion, but your father and his gf made your early life very difficult, and I think you need therapy to work through your anger and become a happier person. I like your idea of giving some of the inheritance to your mother. It is a bitter awakening for your father's gf after 20 years, but she really should have secured her position somehow.

You say you dont need the money, so withholding it for the reasons listed seems petty and vengeful. She lived with your Dad for more than 20 years, a man that you described as, \"extremely abusive, emotionally distant\". She is probably close to Dad's age, so kinda tough for her to build much of a retirement. You dont have to give her all of it, but you could take a piece of it and set up a trust that will kick in monthly payments when she retires to make her life a better and easier one.

You literally don\u2019t need to take any other exam out of that list and most people don\u2019t. Also. GSRE and series 7 are the same thing\u2026", "For the first one he was an AH (but cheating is not a misogyny move, but an A H move). For the second one, she made her own bed (her actual situation it\u2019s entirely her fault), she could not be a parasite and do something with the opportunities she got, thats more than most people get. \n\nI haven\u2019t read that OP has sisters so I don\u2019t know why you mentioned \u201cleft everything to the only boy\u201d.", "I would give the girlfriend exactly the same treatment that she gave OP. That means no money, just ignore her", "thats helpful  \nThank you!", "Fresh off the boat! That\u2019s moi", "OP said Dad planned on spending his money, inheritance typically defaults to children.  It is likely the dad died without a will.", "Anyone doing mergers and acquisitions would know what the other licenses are. They are all part of the same industry, so everytime you say they're a different industry, you're wrong.\n\nI'm not in IB and I know what the IB licenses are. \n\nAnyone with an Ivy league degree would know the others. \n\nI didn't go to ivy and I know what the other licenses and jobs in the industry are.\n\nAlso. Series 7 and GSR are the same. Not the GSRE. Do better at googling. I keep leaving you these pits to fall in and a shovel to dig your hole deeper and you just keep digging and falling.", "OP mentions in the original post that their father told them specifically that it was going to them. Which makes no sense given their relationship and that they supposedly weren't communicating.", "I don\u2019t think OP is necessarily lying. I\u2019m a recent grad working in RX at a top EB and idk what those licenses are either. I went to HYPS and we didn\u2019t have an undergrad business school just like most top targets so I think it\u2019s normal to not learn abt them in school. I have no clue what GSRE is or any of that other shit too lmao. I just took SIE and Series 63 this spring and summer, didn\u2019t even take 79. You seem to be overindexing on these licenses a bit. OP\u2019s current comp does seems a bit high but it\u2019s plausible if he joined a growing HF at the right time and rode the tech wave up but the odds of him being one of those very few people are quite low imo. I have mentors who are on similar comp paths though so never say never. I also don\u2019t think a 32 year old would write the way OP does lmao, calling people \u201cbroke\u201d.", "Guilty conscience when he was dying?  It's not like that never happens."]}
