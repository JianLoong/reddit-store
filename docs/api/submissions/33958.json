If he had wanted to have any of his wealth to go to her after his death, he would have made some arrangements for that in the last 20 years.  The fact that you were the beneficiary of all of his accounts strongly indicates that every time your father has a choice of who to leave his money and other assets, he made an informed and deliberate choice to pick you and not his GF.\n\nYou should honor your Dad's choice and keep that money.  His GF's lack of money is the consequence of her own actions and behaviors (living off a man to whom she wasn't married for decades, choosing not to work or earn an education, being rude to you...).\n\nI recommend you talk to a few based financial planner who is a fiduciary to get advice on investing this money for long term future benefits for you and your Mom.", "You don't owe her anything.

Please do not take offence at this suggestion. Most people could really do with some therapy in my opinion, but your father and his gf made your early life very difficult, and I think you need therapy to work through your anger and become a happier person. I like your idea of giving some of the inheritance to your mother. It is a bitter awakening for your father's gf after 20 years, but she really should have secured her position somehow.

You say you dont need the money, so withholding it for the reasons listed seems petty and vengeful. She lived with your Dad for more than 20 years, a man that you described as, \"extremely abusive, emotionally distant\". She is probably close to Dad's age, so kinda tough for her to build much of a retirement. You dont have to give her all of it, but you could take a piece of it and set up a trust that will kick in monthly payments when she retires to make her life a better and easier one.

But I\u2019d check with an attorney to see how solid your footing is if there was no will.  Your dad should have had a will or made her beneficiary of the accounts if he intended her to have anything significant.  If you were feeling particularly generous, you might set her up as lifetime beneficiary of a trust that pays out some small amount like $20K a year.", "NTA. Keep the money. It\u2019s not hers. You don\u2019t owe her anything. She was a girlfriend for 20 years for a reason.", "Given how she treated and talked about you, if that\u2019s the case then she forfeited any moral right to part of the inheritance - of which no part was left or gifted to her by your dad. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nShe was a mistress, not a wife. He chose not to marry her for over 20 years. I'm sure he bought her gifts while he was alive. Those gifts are all she should reasonably expect from her sordid affair. \n\nHe intentionally passed on his wealth to you, not her. Maybe that was his way of apologizing for how poorly he and she treated you. \n\nDefinitely spend some of this money to improve your mom's life.", "NTA. Fuck her. You taking the full inheritance from your asshole father would be karma. She deserves nothing. Given her actions throughout your life she doesn't deserve a dime.", "NTA. Take your mom on a multi-week cruise \ud83e\udd0c I guarantee the thing she would rather have is your time, not your money, *ESPECIALLY* if she didn't get enough time with you as a kid due to her working so much.", "NTA.  At the end of the day, it is your inheritance and what you do with it is 100% your decision.  It seems that your father's gf is reaping what she sowed.  It was kind of mean of your father to not leave her anything after 20 years, but, per your own words, he wasn't the nicest of people.  Follow your heart and do what you think is right.", "Yeah, if you don't need that money, donate large portions to good charities and make sure GF knows about your philanthropy.", "Might even have married the lady, lol.", "Yes, your mom should receive a part of his money as she was screwed over the divorce. I think that's the best thing to do", "NTA - if you dont want to keep it maybe donate to a  nonprofit that helps women and children who are in situations like the one your dad created, or start a scholarship in your moms name for single parents who are starting over.", "Poor family without connections but was left a 3 million estate.", "Both him and his mother are first gen immigrants?", "Lol the happiness of the people who left his mother to struggle is entirely worthless. Be so fucking for real dude.", "Dad was definitely an AH to his gf. *Twenty years* together, a 3 mm estate, she has no assets and is low income, and he cuts her out entirely in favor of a son who doesn\u2019t need it? That is *cold.*\n\nBut it\u2019s also not OP\u2019s fault and not his  problem. NTA.", "Resenting someone for continuously doing bad to you, is not something you need to get over.\n\nYou just stop interacting with that person.\n\n\nThere\u2018s nothing to forgive because they haven\u2019t changed.", "This is great advice. This post was originally 2500 more words before the word limit made me delete it all and it was mostly me ranting about what my dad and gf did to me but I had to delete it. The point is. I still definitely have a great deal of resentment and anger and bitterness. I\u2019ve been in therapy for five years now and I do think it has helped. I would highly recommend it.\n\nEdit: I mean letters, not words", "Lucky breaks always help, but study, being smart about the work skills you develop and working hard are even more important..", "Or, as I\u2019d refer to his Mom, the phoenix who rose from the ashes.", "Not from the US so I dont understand this too well but if he was older like 10 or something when they moved to the US, would that make both of them 1st gen?", "Share it with your mom, she deserves it.   \n\nIf your dad never changed his will in her favour or leave her anything after being with her for 20 years then he didn't want to leave her anything.", "Absolutely share it with your mom! She sounds like a wonderful person and great role model for you.", "what culture is he from. sounds like he just hates women", "Was he renting the home he shared with his girlfriend?", "Just keep everything and block her. NTA", "Either he was feeling really guilty or GF really pissed him off.", "Not denying the father was an AH, but how is it that with a, basically, sugar-daddy worth that much was she unable to go to school and make a career for herself?? \n\nIt sounds like she lived comfortably off of his sole income and yet she never decided to take advantage of that to further her education or career?\n\nHonestly, that\u2019s her fault alone in that. And I think, in some very funny way, OPs dad may have left the money to his son solely for that reason.\n\nHad GF actually tried to be an equal partner in the relationship instead of a leech she might\u2019ve earned herself some of that inheritance, but she proved to the bitter end that she was nothing more than a parasite and without her host she\u2019ll have nothing.\n\nOP should take the inheritance and give it to his mom. She basically climbed Everest to get out of poverty while raising a son who is successful now and she herself is also living a very comfortable lifestyle.\n\nIf not to her, should she choose to refuse to it, do as others have suggested and put it into a charity or scholarship for those who are impoverished. Give them more chances to get out.\n\nBest of luck OP, NTA at all", "If your resentment and anger is colouring the rest of your life, you do need to deal with it. For your own sake. As for forgiveness we have completely different views of it. You need to forgive for your own sake. You needn't even tell the other person that you have forgiven. It is nothing to do with them. I agree that you should stop interacting with toxic and entitled people.", "Having good mental health isn\u2019t always having positive thoughts and feelings\u2014it\u2019s having appropriate responses. Anger and resentment are totally valid in a situation like this and your inheritance is a reparation from someone who did wrong to you and your mom. I hope that it provides some comfort as you navigate this time of complicated grief.", "I think you\u2019re going to be good because yes, there\u2019s resentment but you seem very self-aware and are a great candidate for therapy.", "I moved when I was 10. Am I first gen immigrant?", "I was going to say the same. \nIt's not invalid resentment, when the ppl you're resenting are just AH's and have treated you poorly. \n\nThere is probably a very good reason the father felt he didn't have to leave anything to his homewrecker gf. \nShe should get some therapy \u263a\ufe0f, and focus on how she can make her own life better,  without mooching off of other ppl. \n\nNTA"]}
