She seems like she does want to spend time with you, as her gift is related to hanging out.", "NAH I think, maybe NTA. Maybe she just forgot or was having a long week or whatever, there's not really any non-awkward way to bring it up again. Don't hold a grudge about it, go to dinner.", "NTA - but I also don't read her thank you text as blaming you or calling you an AH, as much as her seeming to only just now remember, and wishing she had remembered or you had reminded her. Didn't seem like a negative text to me.", "NAH - I read that in a jokey way. I\u2019d respond just saying lunch sounds great, when are you free?", "NTA\n\nShe offered to tske you out and forgot about it??\nAnd then complains that YOU didnt remind her??\n\nClassy...", "nta, tell her you're not a pest about celebrating yourself but you're still available ;)", "If it  was important she would have remembered.
