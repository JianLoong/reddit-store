She's had it since before I was born. When I (23F) was a kid, the house was generally pretty cluttered, and we had one or two rooms that were \"mom's rooms\" that we couldn't go into, but it was pretty livable. After my siblings and I moved out, she got a lot worse. Now, she's living in two rooms in her house, her bathroom and her living room, and even those are full of trash. \n\nWhenever I visit her, I have to wear a mask because the smell in the house is so bad. Her bathroom is still functional, but only the toilet itself, because the shower and sink are also full. The fact that my mom lives like this is bad enough, but she has also has four cats. They aren't shelter cats, but rather cats that my mom \"rehabilitated\" that she took in off the street. None of them are well taken care of. They don't have litter boxes, and she doesn't let them outside, so they just shit wherever. They all have fleas and probably worms because the house is so dirty, and she never takes them to the vet because she doesn't leave the house. I've spoken to my mom about this multiple times, but she won't listen to me. She took in her most recent cat just two months ago and is already trying to trap another cat that she found in her backyard. \n\nMy sister (19F) recently came back from college and was just as horrified as I am. My mom is a lot closer to my sister than she is to me, so my sister and I decided that she would get my mom out of the house while I stole the cats. My sister convinced my mom to go with her to visit our brother, and while they were gone, I managed to catch all the cats. I took them to a shelter a couple hours away so my mom wouldn't be able to find them. One of the cats turned out to have terminal cancer, so he ended up being put down but the rest of them are currently up for adoption. \n\nMy mom is livid. She has called me multiple times a day since this happened (over a week ago), demanding I tell her where I took her cats and calling me a horrible person and a horrible daughter. She has also told all my siblings. Some are more angry at me than others, but most agree that what I did was wrong. Even the sister that helped me says she feels awful about it now and regrets doing it. At first, I didn't feel bad at all, but now I am beginning to question my decision.

She's suffering from a diagnosable mental disorder and needs assistance.\n\nThank you for rehoming those cats...that's no way for them to live. :(\n\nI'm sorry you're having to deal with this.  Be prepared for this to get worse before it gets better.", "NTA. I help rescue cats and get called into similar situations frequently. These hoarding situations where there are cat feces everywhere are extremely unhealthy for the animals and they can develop severe physical and mental health issues if they are in these situations for too long. \n\nThe reality is that if you hadn't done this, the health department or animal control would likely have been called in eventually and the cats would likely be in much worse condition by that point. It's likely that you saved those three animal's lives and also saved the fourth a tremendous amount of suffering.\n\nOn behalf of the cats, thank you for doing that. Dealing with hoarders is often a thankless task. Their mental illness cannot allow them to see the unhealthy reality of their situation. Sorry you had to go through condemnation for doing a good thing.\n\nI would strongly advise you to go one step further and call local pet stores, rescues and shelters and warn them about your mom. It sounds like to date she has only invited in strays, but we've found hoarders often like to replace the cats removed from their households quickly (and usually with even more of them). You'll want to make sure she's on no adopt lists locally to try to slow this process.", "While what you did was morally right and what was needed for those cats I do have to caution you that just taking pets/things from hoarders behind their backs is more likely going to cause them to double down and worsen the behavior rather than better it. It is going to make them feel attacked/defenseless and hoarder brain will take over any sort of logical reasoning because that's what the disorder does. It is very likely that now that you've gotten those cats out of the house she will just start collecting more and guarding them even more fiercely than before in response. \n\nHoarding is a horrible disorder that can wreck havoc on so many people's lives in so many different ways. The longer it goes on the more and more difficult it's going to be to pull them out of it. This definitely shouldn't be on you to fix and really the best option at this point is to get someone like adult protective services and/or other mental health services involved. You did a good thing getting those cats out of that environment, but it did not fix the problem and may have even made things worse going forward now. \n\nBest of luck to you, I can't imagine how hard it is to see your mother living like that. I hope she can get help and you all can find peace.", "NTA. You have to separate emotions and family when the welfare of an animal is at stake.

I think you could've handled it better, but what you did was unambiguously correct.

And one of them had to be put down, which is heartbreaking because it was dying.\n\nI feel like if you tried to talk to your mom, she would immediately get upset that you want to take the cats away.", "NTA but your mom will probably just find more cats. Adult protective services needs to be called, your mom needs help.", "NTA, you were acting in the best interests of the cats and your mother. It sounds like she needs professional help before she takes in any more strays.", "Holy shit I wasn't expecting that. Absolutely NTA. It really sucks that you found yourself in that position, but you did the right thing. Those poor cats were not being looked after and I don't even think it's hyperbole to describe the situation as animal abuse, even if it was not intentional on your mom's part.\n\nI hope the cats found good homes, and I'd look into trying to get your mom some help too if possible. She'll probably resist, especially after this, but as you've described it that house has become an extremely unhealthy place for anyone to live in.", "NTA. Your mom needs help, but she's an adult and it's going to unfortunately be up to her to decide to get that. Those cats are innocent and helpless. Someone had to step up and help them, because it's obvious your mother is not in a position to make responsible decisions for them.", "Thank Yoda for people like you who save animals lives.

She's got a 3 bedroom house that was her dad's and you can't walk in to any of the bedrooms except hers, which has a little pathway from the doorway to her bed. She's had several animals over the years, so her house reeks, and no matter how many times I clean it for her it gets right back to what it is. It's hard seeing someone you care about living like that, and you were only trying to help. It's not like you threw away a box of old photos, you threw out live animals who weren't being properly cared for and weren't making her living  situation ANY better. \nNext time family says anything at all ask them what they've done to help recently then?", "NTA. The cats couldn't get themselves out of that situation. They're innocent animals.\n\nI feel bad for your mom. She definitely needs help. But I can't see why people are saying YTA. You rescued innocent animals from abuse.", "NTA, your mom needs professional help because this is not normal behavior. You did what those cats needed and you did it more kindly animal welfare would have had they gotten involved.", "NTA:  I have a friend who is the same but at max had 20 cats!  That ain't healthy for the people or the cats.  Hoarders will resist every effort to declutter and clean.  It actually causes them anxiety.  She needs mental help, just cleaning won't stop her from restarting this same cycle again.", "You probably should have called animal control and they in turn could have gotten your mom the mental health help she needed.  Don't advertise what you are doing, but get her some help.  Those animals are suffering so no, you didn't do anything wrong. NTA.", "NTA. You saved the cats.", "NTA. I get that you doubt your actions now, but this is definitely better for the cats.", "NTA.  If your siblings are angry that you rescued animals from an abusive situation, then they are pretty awful. It doesn't matter that the abuse is a function of your mother's mental illness. You did exactly what you had to do. \n\nNow you and your siblings need to come up with a plan to get her some help.  Hoarders are notoriously difficult to treat, so find someone who specializes in that area.  You can't let her continue to live in filth.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for helping those poor kitties. The one with cancer was most likely in a lot of pain, too. As another commenter said, it\u2019s time to get any senior & adult resources to help. Your mother needs professional help.", "NTA. \n\nThis is not the ideal way to go about things but given the previous conversations it sounds like she was unable and maybe unwilling to properly care for them. It was the only way to ensure their safety. \n\nYour mom has every right to be upset about it. She\u2019s in the wrong but you did invade her space and get rid of her pets. That\u2019s gotta sting. It still had to be done. \n\nOverall this will be healthier for your mom too. It\u2019s not healthy to be around feces etc. No litter box is a huge issue", "NTA, but I urge you, along with your sister, to get your mom some professional help ASAP.", "What you did was necessary for the cat's health and well being.

I have a dog and two cats, and I would freak out if somebody got me to leave, and then took them.  I would have a very hard time trusting people after that. \n\nI think it's going to be a lot harder for you to work with her now.  She probably won't trust people, she's mad and grieving, and she probably will be even more reluctant to leave her house, except to trap more cats.  I hope you can find her some professional help, and you might benefit from some therapy too because having to go through all this is really tough.

NAH I guess.", "NAH was a harsh was to end the relationship but the cars could be better off and at least you'll never have to see her again", "ESH.  You did exactly what the experts advise not to do with a hoarder: take their hoard without their permission.

I believe your heart is in the right place, and the cats are better off now. \n\nBut i do think that it was wrong to go about it this way. Deceiving your mom and going behind her back like this is wrong, and it might cause her to be less likely to accept help in the future. It might also make her hide any additional cats she could bring in. \n\nYou could have spoken to her before, and asked her permission to take the cats to a vet. If she refused that, then you could have at least told her, that for the wellfare and safety/health of the cats, you/siblings were going to step in, call animal control, or something similar to make sure the cats did receive medical attention and their needs were met. Soft YTA because good intentions, but wrong execution.\n\nI really understand that this is a very difficult situation. Your mom needs professional help with her hoarding. But treatment and change is only possible if she is willing to accept help. Standing by and seeing all of this happening for so many years, trying to help when she refuses to accept that help, can be frustrating i know. Please keep reminding her that professional help is available, and that you love her and want the best for her. If she chooses to keep it this way, you must accept that. She is an adult and responsible for her own life. Always set and guard your own boundaries when it comes to your health and well-being, OP! Good on you for making sure the cats have a better life. Prepare for mom to bring in new cats after this.\n\nBest of luck to you and your family \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA. your mom needs help, like therapy and a family intervention she must take part in to have any chance of working, taking away her stuff behind her back is *not* the way to go about it. especially her pets. she\u2019s probably going to get worse and more closed off to help now", "I understand your actions, but YTA.

A call to animal control and a wellness check request by the local police could have likely gotten this handled without triggering a manic meltdown.", "Ohhhhh no.\n\nYTA, but I understand why you did this.  Your mom OBVIOUSLY has some pretty serious mental health issues, and you probably just exacerbated them by stealing her pets.  There are a LOT of things that you could have done before you went to this (most of which I probably would have called in reinforcements b/c I think you are a bit young to really handle this - her friends or siblings,  your siblings, your dad, if he is alive and they are on ok terms).  Even the police, who likely would have referred her to social work, or animal foster agencies who would have likely put the cats in short-term foster facilities.  You should have found someone willing to donate kitty litter and litter boxes.\n\nOh nooooooooooo.\n\n\"Livid\", obviously, you stole her pets.

She's not a cruel or bad person, she's simply unable see how unhealthy the setting is for pets to live in, nevermind herself.\nAs long as she's in denial about her affliction and how seriously concerning her circumstances are, she cannot comprehend why you'd \"betray her trust\" in this way, so I understand her hurt and upset.\n\nAnd the reasoning for NTA would be because while your mom didn't mean to severely mistreat the cats, the facts are: \n\n1) she was not providing them the quality of life/care that pets should have rights to.\n\n2) you saving the cats from your mom's neglect spared one of them from a slow and agonizing death of succumbing to terminal illness.\n\n3) there is no guarantee that the other cats wouldn't have gotten injured living in an unhygienic and cluttered house.\n\n4) and since she's not taking them to vet, one cat has a highly contagious disease ?

Your mom clearly is suffering from mental illness and needs help, but with hoarders, it's never that easy. Obviously your intentions weren't bad, you just wanted to help the cats, and I think that is very commendable of you. However, in the case of hoarders, it's never as simple as removing the cats. The Kitten Lady actually has a great YouTube video about how she interacts with hoarders while trying to rescue cats, I highly recommend looking it up. When the Rescue I foster with goes in to help in a hoarder situation, we usually don't just remove all the cats, but try to work with the owner as much as possible. Usually this involves getting them their vaccines, spayed/neutered, bringing in food, etc. We also then try to get them to surrender as many cats as they are willing to. But it's not easy. And it's absolutely heartbreaking for the cats and the person who is hoarding them. I wouldn't go in like that again, but I would see if you can contact a local rescue to help if she ever starts collecting cats again. Since they aren't as close to the issue as you are, they might be able to provide support and an objective point of view.", "There's rarely a way to handle a situation like this with hoarding and not coming out feeling a bit like an AH even if you are in the right.

Houses like that can go up in flames very quickly. Or she could trip and fall, or something stacked up with rubbish could fall onto her.", "I was about to say the same thing. Hoarding is a type of anxiety disorder. Just removing the cats isn\u2019t a long term solution. I work with people with hoarding conditions. Just removing clutter or animals doesn\u2019t address the underlying issues, and frequently people will replace the animals or clutter within a few months.", "if she contacted animal welfare people, can you imagine how humiliating that would be? plus she could face fines. that would be so much worse. this family needs a therapist and an intervention where nothing is done behind anyone\u2019s back. mother is never going to get better with more trauma, she\u2019s likely going to be even less likely to accept any help now. yes, the cats matter, but the family should have come together to help her at least *try* to self-realize.. i know it\u2019s not always easy or even possible, but hoarding usually starts from trauma and doing this behind mother\u2019s back is just *sooo* much worse :/", "This. 100%.

Her mother may have been on her way to animal hoarding", "Yes, professionals do not advise forcibly cleaning for a a hoarder. . I'm a psych DNP; hoarding is notoriously treatment resistant. However, that advice tends to go out the window when living things are being harmed. Animal control and CPS, don't give a shit about the hoarder's trauma. This advice also changes when the hoarder does not live alone; one person's mental illness does not take precedent over the physical and mental well-being of others in the household.

This type of mental illness is treatable but it is very difficult to deal with. OP's mom needs professional diagnosis and help asap.", "I think they could've handled it better in the sense that they could've involved the mother in the process more, to the extent that would be possible. Maybe start by asking if they can take the cats. If not, at least be upfront that they're going to involve animal control.\n\nMaintaining a sense of control is a HUGE motivation for hoarders, so this kind of deception could be really, really psychologically painful for her. So yeah, did the right thing in the end, but now the relationship with mom is likely even worse off.", "For anybody else facing this type of situation, the most legal thing to do is to call your animal services and report the animals in a hoarding situation and feces. That is likely to get the animals removed. \n\nThere are some downsides to taking that approach however:\n\n1. Many animal services departments have extremely long wait times and hoarding situations are usually low on the list unless gratuitous (dozens of animals). The animals could continue to suffer for months while waiting for a visit.\n2. Often the animals are remanded to high kill shelters, and you don't get to pick where they end up.\n\nThe way OP did it, she technically could be legally liable for the financial value of the mom's cats. But those judgments are usually not very high (particularly with strays with no vet histories), and OP got to select the shelter the cats were given to and prevent further health problems.", "Thankful,  you are. Lol.", "I'm far from the first person to refer to animals as part of the hoard.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal\\_hoarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_hoarding)", "I agree that OP is not a real asshole or a bad person. I think OP did a good thing by making sure the cats have a better life now. I also agree with you, that mom is an animal abuser (and therefore, something HAD to be done, whether mom liked it or not) \n\nHowever, the fact that OP and sister did this *as a surprise, behind mothers back* makes it wrong. Mom being an animal abuser doesn't mean that lying to her/deceiving her is justified. Like I said, OP could have at least told mom flat out that there was going to be an intervention for the sake of the cats. Sure, mom would not have liked that either, but at least that would have been an upfront, honest, and justified way to handle this situation and get the cats what they need.\n\nSo I disagree when you say that \"that alone makes it NTA\".  Her mom needs professional help and this way of handling things could make it worse in the future, because it gives off the signal of no trust. At the very least, just be honest and upfront about your intentions instead of doing it in a sneaky way.\n\nAlso, I would advise OP to have an outside party inspect the house, to maybe stimulate mom to get in contact with professional help. It might be a fire hazard if the house is so full of stuff.
