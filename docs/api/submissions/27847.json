Gets a giant vehicle, can't maneuver giant vehicle \ud83d\ude02", "Agreed, I've been in garages in DC and Boston where a full size pickup would either just squeeze in or not fit at all. Even on street parking can be a problem as they are really hard to parallel park. We had a series of F-350s in the 90s and early 2000s to tow our trailers. I hated taking them into the city.", "Yeah my dad did that too with his 72 challenger...without talking to my mom and then he held it over her head for their entire marriage. Held it over mine too. It was a fucking weapon. Car is still gone. He is dead. And it still hurts to know he didnt do it cause he was having a kid but to use it against.", "i'm a couple of years older than your kid, my dad did the same thing.  He still has pictures of that car though lol.   \n\nBut he doesn't give me shit over it ever.  I guess i was worth it haha!!", "My mom and I still joke about how it's my fault she had to sell her Corvette 41 years ago. She kept it when she had my older brother, but once I came along, it obviously couldn't fit two car seats. The poor woman had to make do with a Smokey and the Bandit style Trans Am lol.

I want to be able to say \"told you so\".", "A 17 year old will survive without a car. And duh, the 100k truck is unnecessary and irresponsible. I'm saying the idea that the kid needs to be somehow compensated is unreasonable", "Agreed. The type of truck OP's husband has is almost always worthless. Even if you need to haul a bunch of stuff, you'd probably be better off with an older and smaller model you don't care about beating up a bit.\n\nBeing proud of having a spotless pickup is like being a lineman with a clean jersey and an unscuffed helmet.", "Fits into the \u2018big hat no cattle\u2019 category.\n\nI know a guy who bought one of those.  Big ass truck, dual rear tires, just massive beast.  Nice looking truck etc., but we were wondering why.  Well, what we didn\u2019t know was that his wife was going to show horses, and they needed to pull a 4 horse trailer, halfway across country, plus room for her stuff.  No problem, then; makes sense.  Maybe a bit showy, but not much.\n\nMost folks in the country have better sense than to spend 100k on some folly.\n\n\u2018Dis one - was a folly.  Or, let\u2019s call it what it probably was: mid-life crisis purchase.  Nothing wrong with that, sometimes one wants to fulfill a dream.\n\nOP, given y\u2019all have the finances, tell him to get himself a nice Lexus SC or 500 or something.  Or, since you seem somewhat partial to Porsche, maybe a 911 (if he\u2019s into classics) or a Boxster.  Should fit right in.\n\nSource: used to work for a consulting firm.  *Many* of them, around 40-50, did that.  Was either a massive truck (that also wouldn\u2019t fit in the parking garage, lol), one of the above or an Audi A8L or TT or similar.  Speaking of which, those ain\u2019t too bad either.  Might be an option, if he can find one.", "Lol. I've driven trucks all my life and will never drive anything but.

And then the cost of insurance on a huge truck for a teen???  That's an eye opener.", "We got tricked into renting a ginormous Jeep, when in San Diego last year.  I had rented a midsize car,  the lady at Avis asked if we wanted a hybrid at no additional cost.  Turns out the hybrid was a 6-7 foot tall Jeep, that we had to return the same day, as it was too tall to fit in  the underground parking lot.  I say \u201ctricked \u201c because the rental went from $300 to $800 ( i cannot hear, and my daughter was helping me listen, and i did not need a hybrid with the $600 up charge)", "And yet, the vast majority of people who find big trucks or, ahem, other big things cool are other boys.", "It\u2019s a Pavement Princess.", "I doubt it's a midlife crisis. This family's baby hauler is a Porsche.", "Ah, I missed the \"us.\" It's still wild that he has a beater and his parents are driving luxury cars.

The Porsche is probably worth more", "So is buying a Porsche to drive around an infant/toddler to be fair.", "He helped pay for the car, and now he can\u2019t use it. That\u2019s fair?", "The issue here is the father a grown family man cares more about a 100,000 truck than inconveniencing everyone else in his family.  He wants everyone to do what he wants cause he doesn\u2019t want to clean out a truck.  But that\u2019s the deal when you have kids some things get FU.", "He will survive, but he probably has to Uber to after school activities now rather than just drive. Maybe even to school.", "How do you know that the kid doesn't need the car to drive to school &/or work. If kid helped pay for his own vehicle he is entitled to drive it where he wants.", "We've got a truck because we DO haul stuff. It is not pristine. Actually right now it has a cubic yard of gravel in the bed.

You aren\u2019t within delivery range for a lot of businesses so you have to go get things yourself. They don\u2019t pick up your garbage, you bring it somewhere. You ride a lot of dirt roads that aren\u2019t in the best condition, etc.\n\nThat being said, because of the things you need it for, you don\u2019t even really want to be doing it in an expensive truck you can mess up, so we tend to keep trucks a long time and only get a new or newer one when the old one isn\u2019t reliable anymore.", "Haha, great analogy!", "Unless it\u2019s a Sunday truck, but these don\u2019t seem like those kind of people.", "Farmers and ranchers write those off as a business expense. Otherwise, why have one?", "Giant trucks are today what bitchin\u2019 camaros were in the 1980s.   \n\n\nThey are the midlife crisis sports car. They are what the high school boys want. They are what men think makes them look cool.   \n\n\nEvery day I watch my neighbor using his to haul his laptop to the office.

I totally understand the idea of \"first car, doesn't need to be, nor shouldn't be fancy,\" but the description makes it sound like a CL deal when they could've dropped 10k or so at a dealer for a reasonable used/almost new. She did say it's reliable, so I bet it just doesn't look as nice. Plus, it was the husband who called it a shitbox (and we all know how he likes to keep his precious truck), so it could very well just be your typical teen's car \ud83d\ude02", "It's probably cheaper than a new Porsche Cayenne though. \n\nMakes him more the asshole here but she drives what we call a Chelsea tractor in my part if the world.

The parents helped with the car and dad can't use it twice a week? That's pretty ridiculous", "Oh no! Anyways", "Yep, my grandfather was a farmer. He had various trucks over the years. He never got rid of a single vehicle he owned - I remember his vehicle graveyard back behind the house. Last time I visited there were probably about 35 - 40 vehicles there. It was 25 miles to the nearest town of any size.

Still expensive.\n\nI could probably \"afford\" a nicer car, but the cutoff where more money buys you significantly less more car is like $35k.  $35k is the 80/20 rule car these days.
