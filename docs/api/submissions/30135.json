In the last six months I was hired an assistant. The assistant is generally on the lazy and the inconsiderate side. Not only does she fight me when I ask her to do things with multiple excuses as to why she won\u2019t be doing it, but she often stands in the way or places her feet up to where I cannot pass by her in the cramped space in which we work. \n\nOn Mondays and Tuesdays, I am blessed to be able to bring my baby with me to work in this cramped space. I do have a pack and play and a few amenities to keep him comfortable in different weather. Last year I ended up bringing my space heater from home in order to keep him warm during the winter weather because he\u2019s a baby and needs a little extra care.\n\nToday is Wednesday so my baby is not here with me. When I left my office for 10 minutes, I came back and my assistant had unplugged my space heater moved it to the other side of the office and was using it for herself. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it had she asked if it was okay for her to move it and use it, but she didn\u2019t. She simply unplugged it, moved it, and used it. With her behavior in the last two days and the fact that when she went on her lunch today, she turned the space heater off and didn\u2019t even leave it on for me aaaand with the fact that yesterday, when I was here WITH my baby, she gave me \u201cpermission\u201d to use the space heater if I wanted to use it\u2026. (When she first started here, I was giving her the general tour and told her I had some things from home including a space heater for the winter that I will be using to keep my baby warm so she knows it\u2019s mine.) I do have a problem with it. \n\nNow where I might be the a-hole\u2026 I have decided that on Tuesday\u2019s when I leave with my baby, I\u2019ll be taking the space heater home with me, and I will be bringing it back the following Monday when I arrive with my baby, and it is Fall/winter so it\u2019s cold. But\u2026 I feel justified to take it home because it is mine (even if that\u2019s a petty reason). \n\nWe do have central heat and air in the office, it\u2019s just a crappy unit so it\u2019s not warm in here but it\u2019s not freezing either, not for an adult at any rate. \nI know I\u2019m being petty but I found her behavior rude and inconsiderate.

I recently moved my baby to the opposite corner to give her more space because it was crowded and I figured maybe that\u2019s why she as often in my way, but she ended up spreading out and being in my way more frequently and more rudely after I did that. Standing in spaces I needed to be to do my job. Place chairs in the same space after I reminded her I needed that space to do my job. I asked her to move the chair and she moved it three inches.
