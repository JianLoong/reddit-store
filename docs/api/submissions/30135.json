In the last six months I was hired an assistant. The assistant is generally on the lazy and the inconsiderate side. Not only does she fight me when I ask her to do things with multiple excuses as to why she won\u2019t be doing it, but she often stands in the way or places her feet up to where I cannot pass by her in the cramped space in which we work. \n\nOn Mondays and Tuesdays, I am blessed to be able to bring my baby with me to work in this cramped space. I do have a pack and play and a few amenities to keep him comfortable in different weather. Last year I ended up bringing my space heater from home in order to keep him warm during the winter weather because he\u2019s a baby and needs a little extra care.\n\nToday is Wednesday so my baby is not here with me. When I left my office for 10 minutes, I came back and my assistant had unplugged my space heater moved it to the other side of the office and was using it for herself. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it had she asked if it was okay for her to move it and use it, but she didn\u2019t. She simply unplugged it, moved it, and used it. With her behavior in the last two days and the fact that when she went on her lunch today, she turned the space heater off and didn\u2019t even leave it on for me aaaand with the fact that yesterday, when I was here WITH my baby, she gave me \u201cpermission\u201d to use the space heater if I wanted to use it\u2026. (When she first started here, I was giving her the general tour and told her I had some things from home including a space heater for the winter that I will be using to keep my baby warm so she knows it\u2019s mine.) I do have a problem with it. \n\nNow where I might be the a-hole\u2026 I have decided that on Tuesday\u2019s when I leave with my baby, I\u2019ll be taking the space heater home with me, and I will be bringing it back the following Monday when I arrive with my baby, and it is Fall/winter so it\u2019s cold. But\u2026 I feel justified to take it home because it is mine (even if that\u2019s a petty reason). \n\nWe do have central heat and air in the office, it\u2019s just a crappy unit so it\u2019s not warm in here but it\u2019s not freezing either, not for an adult at any rate. \nI know I\u2019m being petty but I found her behavior rude and inconsiderate.

However we have been in this space for 4 years (my baby for a year and a half). She\u2019s been in it for 6 months, and her job is to go out and bring me things but she\u2019s often just sitting down doing nothing. I recently moved my baby to the opposite corner to give her more space because it was crowded and I figured maybe that\u2019s why she as often in my way, but she ended up spreading out and being in my way more frequently and more rudely after I did that. Standing in spaces I needed to be to do my job. Place chairs in the same space after I reminded her I needed that space to do my job. I asked her to move the chair and she moved it three inches. I rearranged things before I left work again to give myself the space I need to do my job and still give her an abundance of space to \u201csit\u201d so I\u2019ll see tomorrow if I come back in and it\u2019s better. If not I guess I\u2019ll have to have a talk with her about it all.

I suppose I could talk to the managers, but I\u2019m also not wanting to be responsible if she loses her job. I\u2019d feel tremendously guilty if she did, even if it\u2019s her own actions that are the main reason why.", "I\u2019m on the non-confrontational side. I often just take on things that bother me and deal with it quietly. She was hired to assist me, by a manager who has a soft spot for girls, and I assume you\u2019ve met people who advocate for how amazing their work skills are to get a job, and then don\u2019t perform to the standards in which they sold themselves. \nI don\u2019t want to be responsible for someone losing their job, so I\u2019m again dealing with her lack of work-ethic. It is a little easier to do my job with her help when she does work, but I\u2019m not sure if the stress of dealing with her rudeness is worth it.. I\u2019m trying to figure that out.", "This is a fair assessment. Thank you. I\u2019ll consider it highly.", "Yes. But the petty. \ud83d\ude05 \nI think if she says anything about it I\u2019ll remind her that it is up there for my baby.", "I don\u2019t have the power to fire her.

Document now and get on with it.

This space heater belongs to me, you don't give \"permission\" as to its use, and you're not to touch it without my explicit say-so.", "Which one of you is in charge? Why are you allowing this to continue?", "Someone is. Get them involved.", "That\u2019s very generous. It is important to track her behaviors even if you don\u2019t take action. It will probably benefit your management in the long run.", "You wouldn't be responsible for her getting fired, she would be. She is there to be a assist. A \"assistant\" who pushes back against helping and just doesn't do stuff when they should shouldn't have the job. I bet if you did talk to HR and get either her work ethic fixed (however unlikely) or get her replaced with someone who does their job properly you will be super thankful. And again, you wouldn't be responsible for her losing her job, she would be for not doing her job.", "You could also take it home and not return with it when your baby is there. You could dress extra warm \ud83d\ude01 but sounds like your assistant doesn\u2019t really help, might be time to request a new one.", "Oooooo, no, I was thinking for you!  Probably wouldn't trust a baby with one.", "Yes, I don\u2019t get why you haven\u2019t started documenting for her removal. She is not a good worker. It has nothing to do with the space heater, though I agree take it home on Tuesdays.", "Thank you for the advice :)", "I\u2019m nice. Too nice for my own good. It\u2019s probably my biggest flaw. I try to make myself smaller for people around me so they\u2019re comfortable. It\u2019s to my own detriment. I know it\u2019s a flaw I should work on but taking that first step is something I am not sure of how to do.", "Fair point.", "Oooh okay. Yeah the space heater is for my baby when he\u2019s up with me at work. I keep it at a distance and constantly check on him to not overheat. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m so mad. I can\u2019t afford another one so easily If she decided to move it and broke it. I need it for my son.", "Grow a spine. She was hired to assist you not the other way round. Every time she refuses to do a task send an  email asking her to enumerate the reasons why she can't do the task assigned to her, or even in the time allotted. Copy your seniors. \n\nAs a manager I don't take crap from anyone. Part of your job is to ensure that your team is doing the job they were hired to do. Your wuss attitude is a disservice to both yourself and your company.\n\nYou don't need to get petty, you need to act professional in the workplace.\n\nAs for your personal things, of course you can and should take your personal things with you when you are not in the office.\n\nEdit: spelling", "I know you've said you're a non-confrontational a few times, but there's non-confrontational and being a doormat. Use your words. If she's quite young, she may just not know office etiquette and you would be doing her a favor by telling her that she's making missteps.
