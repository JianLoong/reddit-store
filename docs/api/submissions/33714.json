{"id": 33714, "submission_id": "18r0arn", "title": "AITAH for not going to a party because I had assignments to work on?", "selftext": "\n\n2 weeks ago my dad tried to make me and the rest of my family go to a party. I (F18) told him I couldn\u2019t go because it was the last day for me to turn in all of my assignments. Mind you this is my 1st semester in college. He immediately told me to shut up and that I will be going to the party. I constantly kept telling him or at least trying to explain why I couldn\u2019t go but he gave me the death stare. He tried to \u201cpunish\u201d me (I\u2019m Nigerian so iykyk) but I still didn\u2019t give up. In the end he took away all my stuff and disowned me. He can\u2019t kick me out since the house is in my moms name. He also took my phone and I bought a new one. He told me not to ever talk to him ever again which I\u2019m fine with because he doesn\u2019t even talk to me anyways. This is the same guy that didn\u2019t even know I was sick weeks ago yet everyone else in the house knew. Yet when he\u2019s sick he\u2019s quick to boss us around and we still take care of him. When he recovers he\u2019s back to doing unholy things out the house but still claims to be Christian. He has been bothering me by constantly name calling me and calling me stupid (I passed high school with a 4.0 GPA) (I\u2019m sorry if there is any grammar errors I can\u2019t stop shaking) He is always comparing himself to me. Am I wrong for not going to that random ass party?", "created_utc": 1703566997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r0arn/aitah_for_not_going_to_a_party_because_i_had/", "score": 196, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.
