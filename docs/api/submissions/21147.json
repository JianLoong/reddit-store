It will remove the issue altogether. \n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 is telling you to get over it, I imagine she sees this as an ongoing issue in your relationship as well. You may want to address that.

So he weaponizes a condition you have to make you think you\u2019re being unreasonable.\n\nI\u2019m not a germaphobe in any way, but if ANYONE wore my clothes regularly and NEVER laundered them before returning them, I\u2019d get pissed right quick and not let them borrow them anymore.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should have your back, wtf is their problem with this request?\n\nYour brother is selfish and disrespectful.

Not even close. He\u2019s the asshole. It\u2019s one thing to borrow your clothes without asking but it\u2019s a whole other thing to put them back dirty! Gross.", "It is not a phobia to want your clothes clean when they are returned.\n\nDisinfect?  I don't know what that entails.  \n\ncan you elaborate?  Is a wash and dry not sufficient?", "NTA. I'm not an extreme germaphobe but I would never wear something on my naked body that someone else had worn on their naked body without washing it first. I also have a separate spot for worn clothes if they're not that dirty, but again I have worn them and I don't put them back in with my clean clothes.\n\nEven if it was a crazy ask they are YOUR clothes that you're freely allowing him to borrow and you have a right to ask that if he borrows them he returns them clean. (But again, this is so basic. You return borrowed clothes clean unless otherwise requested.)\n\nYour gf did react strangely in my opinion but I'd guess she might be annoyed with the way your this has affected other parts of your life.\n\nYou might not feel ready for therapy but it's something to consider. Or maybe just an online support group to start. Being this particular about cleanliness is going to have far reaching consequences across your life.", "NTA but I mean couldn\u2019t you start with if you don\u2019t wash them you can\u2019t use them? No you don\u2019t need a reason to kick him out and there is probably more to it.

Get a new doctor. \n\nWhat you do with your brother is your choice, it's your house. But OCD is very taxing on a relationship, leading to resentment.

I have a younger brother too but to be fair he is much much younger than me (10+ years) I can\u2019t help by acknowledging my own bias here. If it was anyone else they would have been kicked out but if it was my brother I wouldn\u2019t, especially after 1 incident", "Going to second this, you need help and you better get it before your partner decides it just isn't worth it living with you any more.\n\nAlso if you ever plan on having children you better have had years of therapy BEFORE trying to have kids.", ">I ask him constantly to wash them after he wears them and he refuses, saying my phobia \"is just a phase\" or \"it's not even a real phobia\" and \"just get over it\".\n\nSounds like a ongoing thing and not a single incident.", "It boggles the mind...do people not realise kids are walking germs?
