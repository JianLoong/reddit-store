I have a stepdaughter Ada (12), a bio daughter Serenity (2.5) and a bio son Milan (4 months). My husband James was married before we met and he lost his wife when Ada was only 3. I met them when Ada was 6 and she was 7 when my husband and I became more than friends. Ada and I have a difficult relationship. I love her and I would never take any of this out on her but she does not love me back and she resists my place in her life. Most people assume that because she doesn't remember her mom and because she liked me when I was just her dad's friend, that I am essentially her mom now and that our relationship should reflect that. But once the relationship with my husband changed and Ada became aware, my relationship with her changed. She closed off from me and has remained that way. We have been in therapy together. She has never said why it bothered her that her dad and I started dating. She has been asked by my husband, by me, by the therapist and by her aunt (my husband's sister) but she never gives an answer.\n\nDay to day I do a lot of caregiving for Ada alongside my bio kids. Even before they arrived, I was primarily the person who did the cooking and was the person with the ability to leave work if Ada got sick and needed to come home. I spend time with her and have attempted to reignite the bond we shared before. But I never got there. I am available to help with homework if needed. I make sure she has what she needs. If she wanted comfort from me I would give it, though she usually rejects it from me.\n\nI still love her but I don't truly consider myself her parent. I never wanted to take her mom's place. I would be thrilled to be her stepmom who she trusts. But I never left the \"she's married to my dad\" stage with Ada. I know she doesn't see me as family of any kind because in school she had a few projects where they had to do a diagram of people they considered family and she never adds me.\n\nBut still, most people call me a parent of three and some will call me a mom of three. My husband's parents mentioned recently that I make being a parent of three kids look so easy. They said I probably want a bunch more and to be a mom of many kids since it suits me so well. I was feeling really low that day and I admitted to them I feel like a fraud when people consider me a parent to three because I do not feel like a parent of three and I don't feel like I'm Ada's parent. I sort of feel like someone who is just around her more than average. They were shocked and told me I was being silly and of course I'm her parent. They said I'm basically her mom. I told them Ada would be adamant that I am no mother to her. They got kind of snappy with me and told me I should not be taking a kids words to heart. They told me I am going to make Ada feel unloved if I keep feeling the way I do and thinking as I do. My husband got home just then and he told them to leave and defended me.

They were probably surprised because that\u2019s not the picture they were imagining of your family dynamics. \n\nHowever, a word of caution. Don\u2019t go around telling people that because if your relationship with your step-child does change, you don\u2019t want it to be common knowledge that you had a rough relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s tough being in your place and I totally get why you feel that way. It just might not be the most beneficial for you to share that to most people.", "NTA\n\nShe was ok with you being Dad's friend, and when it became more that's when it changed.

All you can do is your best maybe be a friend rather than a parent, don't push the Mum thing, let her call you by your name.", "Best to figure out words you\u2019re comfortable with (like we have 3 children).

They should have offered you comfort but instead gave you shallow judgmental truisms and admonitions. Shame on them.\n\nI guess you better keep this to yourself, your husband, and your therapist at this point, though a discussion group with other step parents who go through this would probably be very helpful.", "NTA.\n\nThis sucks for not just you, but for Ada too. She likely hears people say that all the time as if her mother never existed and that has got to hurt.\n\nI think you need to emphasise to her that all you want to be is an adult she can trust and rely on. That no matter what other people say, you know you're not her mother or able to replace her mother. That while you would like to be her stepmother, that isn't the same as her mum, and if you can only be Dad's Wife in her eyes, that's okay. You just want to be on friendly terms, no matter the relationship label.", "No I don\u2019t think YTA\n\nI think Ada will never look at you like her mother either, nor would she want to forget her mother who passed away. I think it\u2019s good you are both in therapy to try and repair and create a bond between you both,   but I imagine it is difficult for Ada. She lost her mom fairly young and has to try adapt to another motherly figure in her life, I don\u2019t think she dislikes you but dealing with grief is a hard process", "Problem: you're describing Ada as the problem and Ada as the one that needs to try, not you. \n\nYou're talking about Ada being unwilling to see you as a parental figure. But whatever words you use to define and call your family, You're the adult. She's a kid who doesn't always yet know what she feels and what to do about it. The person who's responsible for taking constant effort and active steps to bridge that gap needs to be you. Just like *any* parent does with their own preteen children.\n\nI will say this though: raising a preteen is fundamentally different to raising a toddler and you need to use different means of connecting. People forget, or overlook, or just don't consider it, but its true and its why so many bio parents struggle with the teenage years as well. The dynamic and what it means to be Ada's parental figure *is* going to be different, but that doesn't make it less important or less valuable. Ada still need you and her dad to establish that connection and make her feel valued and loved as family, but how that occurs is not going to be the same as how you bond with a toddler.     \nIf you're trying to use Serenity and Milan as your measuring stick, you are already setting both you and Ada up to fail.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t doubt that it\u2019s hard when you want a deeper connection with her and it\u2019s not being reciprocated but she is young. Perhaps she might not ever get to that place but she will remember all the times that you were there for her. That is the one thing in your control. From what it sounds like you\u2019re a good person and you\u2019re doing a good job with her.", "NTA.  It\u2019s complicated, and mom/parent of three feels too simplistic of a label.  Sounds like her grandparents had a reactionary response to protect Ada.  None of you are wrong.  \n\nYou are more of a parent to Ada than many moms are to their children, though it\u2019s completely understandable that you feel more like a caregiver than a mother.  Having two very young, mom-dependent children is likely highlighting the distance between you and Ada.  The teenage years will be rough regardless.  Doubt and fear will be present, so try not to beat yourself up.  If you continue to show up and keep your heart open- those will serve your family best.  Those are what make a parent.", "NAH. You're not an asshole for feeling like you're not really her mom. She's not an asshole for not taking a stronger liking to you. Your inlaws are not assholes for recognizing that you've stepped up as a mom and being worried about their granddaughter hearing you don't feel like one (though they sound pretty disconnected from her if they don't understand).\n\nNo assholes. Just a less than great situation. Just keep being sincere and open. You can't force yourself to feel like her mom, anymore than you could force her to feel like you're her mom. Hope things get better but it sounds like you're all doing what you can.", "My ILs are the first people I have said this to outside of my husband and therapist. I don't say it to people because I don't want to cause more problems overall. Sometimes it's hard to hear the comments because it doesn't feel true.

We never asked her or suggested for her to call me mom or any kind of different thing other than my first name. That's something that should come from the child and not be coaxed. My husband and I agree on that.", "I don't really think she dislikes me personally either. It feels more like she dislikes the idea of the role. But she has never said that specifically either. Before dating my husband I knew she liked me and our relationship was so sweet. I wish we could go back to that. I loved it.", "I have tried my best to bridge that gap. I also don't blame Ada specifically. I'm not angry at her for not wanting me to be more. Does it upset me? Yes. But I understand I cannot force things. I have never tried to force things and I have worked with a therapist to come up with ideas on how best to try and bridge things between us. She doesn't want it.", "Maybe she's pushing you away because people told her, when the wedding happened, that she will have a new mom now. If people around her keep telling her you're her mom, even if you and your husband are giving her time, even if everything you do is the right thing to do, she will close herself and be distant with you in order to \"not betray her mom\". Or maybe she just feels bad for not feeling what others are telling her she should feel. \n\nI wish you the best of luck with all this", "She's only 12, she might not have the words to express her feelings. If you're the primary caregiver for 3 children you're doing the work of a parent with 3 children even if Ada doesn't see you as a parent so I don't think you should worry too much about people calling you a parent of 3. You and Ada have a relationship that works for Ada, if you need to discuss it with friends and family for your own well-being that's fine but otherwise let people accept what you do at face value of being a parent and continue to let Ada navigate the relationship the way she wants to.\n\nAlso, maybe try a different therapist. I can think of at least 4 reasons Ada might withdraw from you and that she might have difficulty expressing but a good therapist (alone or with her dad) should be able to help her express them without putting words in her mouth.", "We have seen more than one therapist with Ada. None of them were able to get her to express the why. She is just very closed off when asked about that and it doesn't seem like anyone can help her open up more on that. Not even when it's just her and them alone or with my husband and not me present. We did our best to find someone she could open up to but we ran out of them.", "\"They said I'm basically her mom.

Your ILs are not there to support you or Ada, they just want you both to shut up and play the role. Fuck them. They're wrong and honestly, if they ever talked to Ada like that when you and her father started dating, it would explain some of why she is so closed up. \n\nI would take this opportunity to talk to Ada and tell her about this conversation and how they ignored your words and how bad that felt. And that if her grandparents ever said anything like that to her, or pressured her to think of you as her new mother, or told her that her feelings didn't matter, like they told you that yours don't matter, that they were just plain wrong.  Tell her you're there for her in whatever way she needs, and no one is going to ever tell you that her words and feelings don't matter.

She doesn\u2019t want to be close, don\u2019t be close. Stop trying so hard, it will just be viewed as weakness and intrusive. Let her lead the way. Be polite, kind, distant, and care only for her physical needs. If she asks you about your distance, explain that you are giving her room, and respecting her choices, and following her lead on where she is wanting the relationship to go. Tell her if she\u2019d ever like to discuss her feelings you will listen. But otherwise, you have gotten the message loud and clear she doesn\u2019t want you pushing her to feel obligated to call you mom or think of you as mom.\n\nDo this consistently while treating your other children as a real mom would. It may never change things, but this really worked with my step daughter. It took a year or two, but over time she got less and less prickly about it when she realized I wasn\u2019t going to force anything.", "NAH and I\u2019d like to offer a perspective of someone who also lost a parent really young.\n\nWhen my father died, my mother spent a lot of time repeatedly reassuring me and reminding me that she is still there for me, she will always be there for me, and it was just her and I now. We were always going to be together, just the 2 of us, and nothing can break us apart, nothing would undermine our relationship. Her and I, we were a team. And unbreakable, uncompromisable team. Nothing will come between us, nothing will ever change her love for me, nothing will take away from it, nothing would ever split her love and focus on me.\n\nThis is something most parents say when their young child loses the other parent. Or at any age really. I imagine something similar was said to Ada.\n\nThen all of a sudden, you come along. And it is obvious her father is now going back on what he told her on her most vulnerable time. He is sharing his love, he is spreading it to other people, he is dividing his attention and focus by not only loving you as much as her, at least in her mind, but having more children a.k.a. even more people that steal from his \u201cunbreakable, unconditional, uncompromising\u201d love for her. \n\nIn her mind, he has betrayed her. I guarantee you so many people in her life probably told her to love you, to respect you, to love her siblings, to be happy for the family that she now has. But all she probably \u201cknows\u201d is that her mother died, and her father lied to her. She was deprived of her mother\u2019s love, and instead of her father doubling the amount of love he gives her to make up for it, he is spreading it to other people.\n\nI can\u2019t think of any way to remedy this other than intense therapy, and actually prioritising her among the kids for a good while.", "OP - \"She has never said why it bothered her that her dad and I started dating.

There's a big difference here in what might be the perception of you rejecting Ada or not wanting her to be your child, and her rejecting you and not wating you to be her mom.

You do however take care of her like a mom would. I think as long as you keep supporting her and not forcing the relationship any further, and just respect her as a person, she may eventually look back and see how you\u2019ve always been there and she just couldn\u2019t handle the grief of losing her mom and the way her family changed forever. Kids have so little (ie no) control over these things and that feeling can lead to survival stress (\u201ctrauma\u201d) which will impact their ability to form relationships with the new parental figure.\n\nBut they can heal, learn, and grow\u2026 sometimes it doesn\u2019t happen until they\u2019re adults and out of the house.", "I understand exactly how you feel.

It may take time - years but you just keep showing up. \n\nOne stepdaughter asked me the moment I was engaged to her dad if she could call me mom.  One clearly didn't want a stepmom and primarily interacted with me as a stand-in for her dad.   As adults, I have a good relationship with both - not entirely parental, but we're all adults and get along.  \n\nI've always been clear with people that I have 3sks and 1 bio kid.
