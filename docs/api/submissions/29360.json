I have a stepdaughter Ada (12), a bio daughter Serenity (2.5) and a bio son Milan (4 months). My husband James was married before we met and he lost his wife when Ada was only 3. I met them when Ada was 6 and she was 7 when my husband and I became more than friends. Ada and I have a difficult relationship. I love her and I would never take any of this out on her but she does not love me back and she resists my place in her life. Most people assume that because she doesn't remember her mom and because she liked me when I was just her dad's friend, that I am essentially her mom now and that our relationship should reflect that. But once the relationship with my husband changed and Ada became aware, my relationship with her changed. She closed off from me and has remained that way. We have been in therapy together. She has never said why it bothered her that her dad and I started dating. She has been asked by my husband, by me, by the therapist and by her aunt (my husband's sister) but she never gives an answer.\n\nDay to day I do a lot of caregiving for Ada alongside my bio kids. Even before they arrived, I was primarily the person who did the cooking and was the person with the ability to leave work if Ada got sick and needed to come home. I spend time with her and have attempted to reignite the bond we shared before. But I never got there. I am available to help with homework if needed. I make sure she has what she needs. If she wanted comfort from me I would give it, though she usually rejects it from me.\n\nI still love her but I don't truly consider myself her parent. I never wanted to take her mom's place. I would be thrilled to be her stepmom who she trusts. But I never left the \"she's married to my dad\" stage with Ada. I know she doesn't see me as family of any kind because in school she had a few projects where they had to do a diagram of people they considered family and she never adds me.\n\nBut still, most people call me a parent of three and some will call me a mom of three. My husband's parents mentioned recently that I make being a parent of three kids look so easy. They said I probably want a bunch more and to be a mom of many kids since it suits me so well. I was feeling really low that day and I admitted to them I feel like a fraud when people consider me a parent to three because I do not feel like a parent of three and I don't feel like I'm Ada's parent. I sort of feel like someone who is just around her more than average. They were shocked and told me I was being silly and of course I'm her parent. They said I'm basically her mom. I told them Ada would be adamant that I am no mother to her. They got kind of snappy with me and told me I should not be taking a kids words to heart. They told me I am going to make Ada feel unloved if I keep feeling the way I do and thinking as I do. My husband got home just then and he told them to leave and defended me. But the words struck a chord with me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697885733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17czy0b/aita_for_admitting_that_i_dont_feel_like_im_a/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It feels wrong because my ILs are the grandparents of all three children in question and I can see why they would maybe take what I said badly. To them it sounds as though I am discarding their granddaughter even after they praised me for doing such a good job at parenting all three kids.

They were probably surprised because that\u2019s not the picture they were imagining of your family dynamics. \n\nHowever, a word of caution. Don\u2019t go around telling people that because if your relationship with your step-child does change, you don\u2019t want it to be common knowledge that you had a rough relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s tough being in your place and I totally get why you feel that way. It just might not be the most beneficial for you to share that to most people.", "NTA\n\nShe was ok with you being Dad's friend, and when it became more that's when it changed. I suspect she does remember her Mum. Naturally she will see you as trying to replace her Mum.\n\nRegardless of your feelings, her feelings are unlikely to change. All you can do is your best maybe be a friend rather than a parent, don't push the Mum thing, let her call you by your name.", "Best to figure out words you\u2019re comfortable with (like we have 3 children). Because regardless of how you feel, you have the job. Just make sure you\u2019re not projecting this onto her. There\u2019s a long way to go as you haven\u2019t survived her teen years yet. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou are doing everything you can to do right by your \u201cdaughter\u201d. I think you ARE her parent even though both you and her do not feel like it is the case, just by virtue of having acted like a parent to her so consistently over the years. \n\nYou sound like a good person and your feelings are normal after having been rejected for so long. \n\nPlease don\u2019t tell Ada you feel that way though, unless this was discussed with the therapist first.", "This is a tough situation, but I say NTA. \n\nYou were at a low point and confessed to people who are close to you and your stepdaughter. They should have offered you comfort but instead gave you shallow judgmental truisms and admonitions. Shame on them.\n\nI guess you better keep this to yourself, your husband, and your therapist at this point, though a discussion group with other step parents who go through this would probably be very helpful.", "NTA.\n\nThis sucks for not just you, but for Ada too. She likely hears people say that all the time as if her mother never existed and that has got to hurt.\n\nI think you need to emphasise to her that all you want to be is an adult she can trust and rely on. That no matter what other people say, you know you're not her mother or able to replace her mother. That while you would like to be her stepmother, that isn't the same as her mum, and if you can only be Dad's Wife in her eyes, that's okay. You just want to be on friendly terms, no matter the relationship label.", "No I don\u2019t think YTA\n\nI think Ada will never look at you like her mother either, nor would she want to forget her mother who passed away. I think it\u2019s good you are both in therapy to try and repair and create a bond between you both,   but I imagine it is difficult for Ada. She lost her mom fairly young and has to try adapt to another motherly figure in her life, I don\u2019t think she dislikes you but dealing with grief is a hard process", "Problem: you're describing Ada as the problem and Ada as the one that needs to try, not you. \n\nYou're talking about Ada being unwilling to see you as a parental figure. But whatever words you use to define and call your family, You're the adult. She's a kid who doesn't always yet know what she feels and what to do about it. The person who's responsible for taking constant effort and active steps to bridge that gap needs to be you. Just like *any* parent does with their own preteen children.\n\nI will say this though: raising a preteen is fundamentally different to raising a toddler and you need to use different means of connecting. People forget, or overlook, or just don't consider it, but its true and its why so many bio parents struggle with the teenage years as well. The dynamic and what it means to be Ada's parental figure *is* going to be different, but that doesn't make it less important or less valuable. Ada still need you and her dad to establish that connection and make her feel valued and loved as family, but how that occurs is not going to be the same as how you bond with a toddler.     \nIf you're trying to use Serenity and Milan as your measuring stick, you are already setting both you and Ada up to fail.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t doubt that it\u2019s hard when you want a deeper connection with her and it\u2019s not being reciprocated but she is young. Perhaps she might not ever get to that place but she will remember all the times that you were there for her. That is the one thing in your control. From what it sounds like you\u2019re a good person and you\u2019re doing a good job with her.", "NTA.  It\u2019s complicated, and mom/parent of three feels too simplistic of a label.  Sounds like her grandparents had a reactionary response to protect Ada.  None of you are wrong.  \n\nYou are more of a parent to Ada than many moms are to their children, though it\u2019s completely understandable that you feel more like a caregiver than a mother.  Having two very young, mom-dependent children is likely highlighting the distance between you and Ada.  The teenage years will be rough regardless.  Doubt and fear will be present, so try not to beat yourself up.  If you continue to show up and keep your heart open- those will serve your family best.  Those are what make a parent.", "NAH. You're not an asshole for feeling like you're not really her mom. She's not an asshole for not taking a stronger liking to you. Your inlaws are not assholes for recognizing that you've stepped up as a mom and being worried about their granddaughter hearing you don't feel like one (though they sound pretty disconnected from her if they don't understand).\n\nNo assholes. Just a less than great situation. Just keep being sincere and open. You can't force yourself to feel like her mom, anymore than you could force her to feel like you're her mom. Hope things get better but it sounds like you're all doing what you can.", "My ILs are the first people I have said this to outside of my husband and therapist. I don't say it to people because I don't want to cause more problems overall. Sometimes it's hard to hear the comments because it doesn't feel true. But like you said things could possibly change or maybe it doesn't but it can then be said that I didn't want it to change so that's why.", "I always have let her call me by her name. We never asked her or suggested for her to call me mom or any kind of different thing other than my first name. That's something that should come from the child and not be coaxed. My husband and I agree on that.", "I don't really think she dislikes me personally either. It feels more like she dislikes the idea of the role. But she has never said that specifically either. Before dating my husband I knew she liked me and our relationship was so sweet. I wish we could go back to that. I loved it.", "I have tried my best to bridge that gap. I also don't blame Ada specifically. I'm not angry at her for not wanting me to be more. Does it upset me? Yes. But I understand I cannot force things. I have never tried to force things and I have worked with a therapist to come up with ideas on how best to try and bridge things between us. She doesn't want it.", "Maybe she's pushing you away because people told her, when the wedding happened, that she will have a new mom now. If people around her keep telling her you're her mom, even if you and your husband are giving her time, even if everything you do is the right thing to do, she will close herself and be distant with you in order to \"not betray her mom\". Or maybe she just feels bad for not feeling what others are telling her she should feel. \n\nI wish you the best of luck with all this", "She's only 12, she might not have the words to express her feelings. If you're the primary caregiver for 3 children you're doing the work of a parent with 3 children even if Ada doesn't see you as a parent so I don't think you should worry too much about people calling you a parent of 3. You and Ada have a relationship that works for Ada, if you need to discuss it with friends and family for your own well-being that's fine but otherwise let people accept what you do at face value of being a parent and continue to let Ada navigate the relationship the way she wants to.\n\nAlso, maybe try a different therapist. I can think of at least 4 reasons Ada might withdraw from you and that she might have difficulty expressing but a good therapist (alone or with her dad) should be able to help her express them without putting words in her mouth.", "We have seen more than one therapist with Ada. None of them were able to get her to express the why. She is just very closed off when asked about that and it doesn't seem like anyone can help her open up more on that. Not even when it's just her and them alone or with my husband and not me present. We did our best to find someone she could open up to but we ran out of them."]}
