Your Dad wanted that money to go to his wife, you honoured his wishes.", "NTA for not trying to sue your deceased fathers wishes.  Sounds like your brothers wanted a piece of it,were willing to throw someone under the bus to get it, wanted the full strength of the pack (you'll get a share too)  and didn't have any personal attachment to throwing mom 2 under the bus. \n\nI'm sure they don't like you for that since you got in the way of whatever greed bit them but you did the right thing just honoring his wishes whether you like woman or not.", "NTA you didn't have any reason to contest the will, and that's okay. That type of legal decision has to be made person by person, and your brothers deciding not to contest because of your decision is not your fault; they made that choice even though it clearly wasn't what they wanted. It's good that they went that direction because of what you've said about your stepmom, and they shouldn't be blaming you for what they ultimately decided.", "I\u2019m an attorney but not yours. I\u2019m not sure how it works in your country/state, but in my state you could not contest the life insurance policy in a dispute about the will because that is not part of the will. A life insurance policy is entirely separate and whoever is the named beneficiary gets the money. Even if the will itself states \u201cI want my life insurance money to go my 3 sons equally,\u201d the named beneficiary controls. If you\u2019re in the US, it is likely the same in your state.", "NTA - your reasoning is sound, and you were right not to jump in on contesting the will.  your final 2 sentences say it all - she was great for your dad and he wanted her taken care of.", "NTA\n\nFor respecting your fathers dying wishes not at all AH.\n\n>\"not backing their play\"\n\nJeez this isnt football we aren't making a 'play', we are talking about contesting a will. A very serious thing to do.", "NTA.  Your brothers could have contested the will without you if they had valid grounds to do so.  Your father chose what to do with his life insurance, and it was an entirely reasonable choice since she was his spouse (and especially considering the sacrifices she likely made to care for him after he became ill).\n\nI realize it was years ago, but I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You wouldn't have had a prayer if you had contested it. Life insurance (I mean you can do whatever you want with it but) is for people who would have reasonably depended on your lost income. That's spouses and deoendant children. It's not married children. If your father had few other assets, why do you think people purchase life insurance in the firsr place?", "INFO: Why did they want to contest it? So that step mom wouldn't get any money?", "NTA... shamefull how people act for inheritances. it truely can be disgusting.\n\n\nLiving trusts people...look into it!", "NTA. What did your brother expected to achieve ? \n\nIt was in your father's will. You and your brother had zero claim to this money. You were right to not disrespect your father's wishes.", "NTA, people get silly when (large amounts of) money is involved. It was your decision, and they should have respected it. To be honest, I think they've watched too my legal dramas as contesting a will is expensive, difficult, and will only succeed for a few defined reasons.", "NTA.  Congrats on putting greed aside and respecting your father's wishes.", "NTA.   \nYou asked your dad essentially for his thoughts, and he gave them, and you honoured them.   \n\n\nAnd it sounds like his wife cared for him for many years, including I presume as a live in carer for a person who was wheelchair bound and in need of extensive care - and they were HAPPY while they lived together. That deserves financial security. Your dad did the right thing. $220,000 split four ways makes far less dent in people\u2019s lives than the $220,000 which probably saw your step mother out through the rest of her life, or made her stable to continue living in peace.", "NTA and I think it is better those two aren\u2019t very close to you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right, they were greedy AHs.", "NTA - Your dad wanted to make sure your step-mother was looked after. Why do your brother's feel entitled to this money? I think that you did a good thing by making sure your dad's wishes remained intact.", "NTA\n\nImagine wanting to rip off the security your dad wished to give his wife. Didn't they know to respect his last wish?", "NTA\n\nYour dad made a decision with a sound mind to provide a life insurance to his wife (your stepmom). Does it sucks for his children? Yes. Does it mean you were still entitled to that money? No. Life isn't always fair. On top of that, you decided to respect your dad wishes because you were also concerned with stepmom living situation, that was really nice of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Was the life insurance in her name or someone else\u2019s? What was your siblings justifications for contesting?", "NTA.  What matters is that you upheld your dad's wishes to the best of your ability.  Your brother's comment about \"not backing their play\" proves they had no intention of doing what your father wishes were. It is your brothers issues not yours, you did right by your father (assuming no illegal/unethical actions took place on your step-mothers side).", "NTA. You knew your dad's wishes. You followed them. Your siblings are obsessed with the money and it's sad that that's what matters to them.", "NTA. Your brothers could have made their greedy grab without your participation.", "NTA.", "INFO: Did your Dad not leave anything for his kids at all? I'm not saying your brothers were right. But if they were blindsided by a will where their Dad left them nothing, I can understand why that would hurt in the midst of grieving. As your Dad has passed, that would explain why you became the target of that hurt, as you're alive and represent \"the reason we got nothing from our Dad\".\n\n\nI am not passing a moral judgement. I am just saying I can understand how things ended up this way if the kids weren't taken care of. It's why people say you should tell your loved ones what's in your will so there are no surprises.", "NTA. Imagine being a person who only cares about the money and can\u2019t tolerate your step mom getting money to survive on. Your brothers can make their own security by making smart choices. Your step mom doesn\u2019t have that luxury at this point. You did the right thing.\n\nBy the way, my step mom took care of my dad two years ago when he was dying. He left everything to her, because she hasn\u2019t been working. She took care of FOUR dying family members in their homes since 2015. She needs to live her life now, and I wouldn\u2019t dream of trying to take money away from her. My husband and I help her out around the house, too, because we need to give something back. Some people have no shame, though.", "So did you and your brothers get anything from your father?", "NTA \u2018cause you respected your dad\u2019s wishes.  Your brothers are the assholes here.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour father knew what he was doing.  These were his wishes.", "Great answer. He was the son that showed love. The others showed greed.", "We're in New Zealand bro. Everything can be contested, although likely to be unsuccessful if everything is adequately stated in a will with little room for here say.", "TBH, our chance of winning anything was furtherest from my mind. I just remembered that look of content on my dad's face and couldn't bring myself to contest.", "Exactly!\n\nLife insurance policies go to the person listed on the form as the beneficiary. \n\nNo one else would have any chance of also getting that money, if there is a beneficiary listed.", "They felt that the money going to my step mom would mean it ultimately goes to our step brothers when she passes.", "It's made me look for close friendships with people who have much more common interests which for the most part has given me a lot of enrichment.", "The will snd life insurance both stated the money should go to my step mom. My brothers wanted to contest as they thought that meant the money would ultimately go to my step brothers.", "Yes as someone who didn't get anything from there dad not even our childhood pictures its horrible.", "$220,000, God willing, by the time she passes, will already have been spent on your step brothers by the time she passes.", "Ok, I get that. But really, she probably won't have anything left to pass down (hopefully! if she lives a long life). But ultimately, it was your father's wishes. I'm glad you decided to respect them.", "Good! Don\u2019t let them drag you down to their level", "NTA - then of course not. \n\nIm curious, was it just the life insurance or was there more to the estate? If so where did that go?", "They're adults also. \nWorth mentioning dad left some debts behind including a credit card and some medical bills. The rest paid off my step mom's house and left her with a good retirement nest egg.", "Depends on what country the stepmom is located in.", "Aside from us telling each other \"I love you\" a few times, it was the last thing he said to me. He never had much. The only home he owned went to my mom when they split many years earlier. So his sense of security knowing he was leaving my step mom this money meant so much to me.\n\nTBH, I probably would have helped my step mom fight any contest for the will at the time. It meant so much to preserve that look on my dad's face.", "No, he actually left more debt behind than he did assets such as his car. He had no property or other investments. He lived in my step mom's house which was always her asset from long before they met.", "Okay wow. Your siblings are *EXTRA* greedy. So someone else mentioned it but they really had no legal standing for this anyway but dang."]}
