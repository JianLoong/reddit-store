Every so often, the baby would make a cute babbling sound. No problem, it's a family restaurant! But then an older woman, presumably baby's grandma, would imitate the baby's sound but at probably THREE TIMES THE VOLUME.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes of this, I walked over to the other table and asked if they could keep it down a bit. I told them I understand it's fun to be out with baby \u2014 it wasn't that long ago for me! \u2014 but asked that the big people keep their voices attuned to the volume of the kids. \n\nOne of the other women stands up and starts screaming at me that she \"has a right to bring her kids to a god damn family restaurant\" and that I need to stop \"harassing her family.\" I calmly explained to her that the baby is doing great, no problem with me AT ALL, but the adults should try not to scream louder than the baby while playing with the baby. \n\nThis woman goes off on me screaming and yelling that I'm harassing her family, that they have a right to bring their baby wherever they want, and threw some nice four-letter words at my direction too. Yes, including that one. The entire party finally got up in a huff, shouted \"clearly families aren't welcome here anymore\" and stormed out of the restaurant with their meals still on the table. \n\nThe manager came by and told me he heard the whole thing and that the family skipped out on an $70 bill. I offered to pay it but he refused insisting it wasn't my fault. However, for the entire rest of the meal, multiple people at further away tables kept staring at me. And when we were in the parking lot on our way out, a woman I'd never seen before came up to me and told me I should be ashamed of myself for\"telling that nice family to leave\" even though that's not what I even asked. \n\nI just feel so frustrated because people seemed so angry at me even though I'm sure they only heard the other woman's die if the conversation because she was screaming while I was trying to maintain a calm voice.

Entitled asses.", "nta. sime people smh", "Not the a hole. I think she over reacted or misunderstood", "Came here to say the same thing. I wouldn't say OP is an asshole but they handled this in absolutely the wrong way and are largely responsible for why it got out of hand.", "I swear the kid was really fine. It was really just the grandma's mimicry that was a little too loud.", "Grandma has hearing issues and instead of getting a hearing aid and fixing it she gets to make everyone around her miserable by screaming at her grandchild in a restaurant. Heaven forbid somebody POLITELY asked them to keep it down IN PUBLIC and the woman turns into an entitled banshee.", "An adult should know not to scream in a restaurant, the fact that an entire family and you apparently never learned the basics of public etiquette is worrying to me.", "I mean, I have to disagree. My mum is HoH and if a stranger came up and POLITELY explained that she had (as is often the case) inadvertently gotten uncomfortably loud, she would appreciate their letting her know. She would be far more embarrassed that she was being shouty without realising it. OP wasn't rude, and asked nicely. The family made a big embarrassing stink about it.", "Honestly, I laughed because it sounds like my grandmother playing with her great-grandkids after she got Alzheimer's and she was still super fun but her sense of decorum and her decibel meter were DEFINITELY broken . . . or my mum, who is partially deaf, and really doesn't notice (and unlike that lady would be horrified and DEFINITELY take it down a notch if you asked her nicely) that she sometimes gets unintentionally but painfully loud, LOL.  \n\nIt's definitely a real thing that happens, and sometimes it's not even for terrible reasons, but you for sure weren't an AH for asking nicely because of that . . . and they massively overreacted.", "listen i don\u2019t necessarily disagree with you but hearing aids aren\u2019t a magical fix that suddenly allow someone to hear! they do *help* but it\u2019s still difficult for someone with them to hear properly like you and i would yk\n\n(i don\u2019t know how to explain it but there are definitely youtube videos out there simulating what it sounds like with them in)", "It couldn\u2019t have been as bad as OP says if everyone was mad at OP and NOT the loud family.

You muppets are so delusional.", "You\u2019re delusional if you think screaming like a baby as an adult in public is acceptable.", "Are you dense? The OP comment says he was the problem and not the lady in question by his own account of bystanders reacting, no one else had an issue but the OP. He admits this. How is this complicated?", "Most likely the bystanders only heard the banshee screaming about her kid when OP calmly told her that it wasn't any issue with the baby but the ADULT GROWN ASS WOMAN who decided screaming in public was perfectly fine. So are you dense? Or just entitled like the shitty family?", "I\u2019m going off the fact that the manager had no problem with what op did, there is no reason a business owner would be ok with someone driving away customers unless those customers were being a problem.", "There is no indication in the story that the woman was screaming or even being too loud. The OP says \u201c3x the volume\u201d but we have no spatial context, no distance. Had the OP story said \u201cand then when the screaming lady left, everyone looked at me with subtle approval\u201d or any indication of affirmation, then it would be different. Instead what I see is a big family dining setting, with lots of talking and chatter , a baby and grandma are sticking out to the OP \u2026 no one else\u2026 and the OP decides to impose his subjective experience of the sound onto the family in question\u2026 imagine this old woman, on Mother\u2019s Day (grand or great grand mother to this baby) and then some entitled dipshit like you and the OP walk up and try to tell them to be quiet. A man, tells women and a baby, in Mother\u2019s Day, to be quiet, in a public dining area. Think about what you\u2019re saying. The OP had no right to do that, he should have called a waiter. You absolute muppet.", "Has it occurred to you that the staff was just in shock and wanted it all too settle down and go away? Just because the waitstaff assuaged the OP doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t blind sided", "They would\u2019ve asked op to leave, if they were a bigger problem than the screaming family that dined and dashed."]}
