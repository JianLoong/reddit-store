My mum is HoH and if a stranger came up and POLITELY explained that she had (as is often the case) inadvertently gotten uncomfortably loud, she would appreciate their letting her know. She would be far more embarrassed that she was being shouty without realising it. OP wasn't rude, and asked nicely. The family made a big embarrassing stink about it.", "Honestly, I laughed because it sounds like my grandmother playing with her great-grandkids after she got Alzheimer's and she was still super fun but her sense of decorum and her decibel meter were DEFINITELY broken . . . or my mum, who is partially deaf, and really doesn't notice (and unlike that lady would be horrified and DEFINITELY take it down a notch if you asked her nicely) that she sometimes gets unintentionally but painfully loud, LOL.  \n\nIt's definitely a real thing that happens, and sometimes it's not even for terrible reasons, but you for sure weren't an AH for asking nicely because of that . . . and they massively overreacted.", "listen i don\u2019t necessarily disagree with you but hearing aids aren\u2019t a magical fix that suddenly allow someone to hear! they do *help* but it\u2019s still difficult for someone with them to hear properly like you and i would yk\n\n(i don\u2019t know how to explain it but there are definitely youtube videos out there simulating what it sounds like with them in)", "It couldn\u2019t have been as bad as OP says if everyone was mad at OP and NOT the loud family.

Instead what I see is a big family dining setting, with lots of talking and chatter , a baby and grandma are sticking out to the OP \u2026 no one else\u2026 and the OP decides to impose his subjective experience of the sound onto the family in question\u2026 imagine this old woman, on Mother\u2019s Day (grand or great grand mother to this baby) and then some entitled dipshit like you and the OP walk up and try to tell them to be quiet. A man, tells women and a baby, in Mother\u2019s Day, to be quiet, in a public dining area. Think about what you\u2019re saying. The OP had no right to do that, he should have called a waiter.

So much so that they will twist whatever you say or do to match their desired victimhoodness. It doesn't matter that you didn't ask them to leave, they now get to brag about how they were run out of that place for having a baby. They will tell this story, over and over again to anyone who will listen. It will get exaggerated further but they will continue to be both the victim and the hero at the same time. it will get further away from the truth and further ingrain in them, that that's how you win at conflict.

They are awful.\n\nHowever, people who do what you did in a restaurant are, honestly, more disruptive. If the noise is a problem leave that to the employees of the venue.

If you were calm and reasonable the other people around you would not be taking the side of the woman who was screaming the C-word at the top of her lungs in a restaurant full of children.  Nobody uses \"that nice family\" to describe a group who was screaming and yelling that language around kids.  (Well, maybe Australians.

And grandma \"imitating\" the baby's sounds at a much higher volume coupled with the woman's only defense that she's allowed to take her baby wherever she wants (even though it was the adult that was the problem, not the kid) almost makes it sound rehearsed.", "I got that feeling too", "Some people like to try the \"talk directly to them first\" approach to avoid an even worse outcry when they feel like they are in trouble. I doubt they would've reacted well if the manager did it either and honestly probably would have left and skipped on the bill too", "If someone who wasn\u2019t an asshole was hard of hearing and was told they were being too loud, they wouldn\u2019t scream that they were being harassed, they would try to lower their volume.", "They didn't dictate, they requested.

It literally cannot be any more obvious with the given information that the OP was out of line \u2014 EVEN IF the family was loud, but we don\u2019t even know that based on the OPs own description.", "If you just assume op is lying or omitting facts then you can make up any reason that they\u2019re the asshole, like I can just say that op went to this restaurant just to bully random families or that the grandma was actually having a ptsd induced panic attack from serving in Afghanistan and op hates veterans. There\u2019s no point to judging op if you don\u2019t believe anything they say.", "You should have imitated grandma at 2x her volume. My husband will do that and then say nothing and let ppl show thier true colors.", "YTA.  Ask management to handle it next time.  This was in no way your job.", "Yeah YTA, as you said it was a family resteraunt and they were being a family.", "Op maybe has a death wish and YTA. You really don\u2019t have the right to dictate someone\u2019s volume.", "YTA. \n\nI'm not a fan of children who are not restaurant ready, but you could have moved your seat or spoken with the manager. Unless the child or party did something to you physy, you were out of order", "NTA, don't expect random onlookers to come to a logical conclusion about what occurred and how things went down.  \n\nNothing you described was that bad on your part, and the other family went nuclear.\n\nThe fact that they didn't pay their meal and the fact that they were being disruptive and then went nuts could even lead to the possibility that they were hoping for drama.", "Great. Now we can't even ask people to conduct themselves in a reasonable manner in public without other people getting angry.

It's their job to deal with this.", "[removed]", "Police should have been called in the family should have been charged NTA", "Nta but next time let management handle it", "NTA but didn\u2019t you know this would happen?

You say the grandma was \u201cliterally screaming,\u201d but apparently this did not bother any of the other tables in the restaurant? And you describe it as 3x louder as a baby cooing, so that sounds like at most kind of loud but definitely not a scream. Why did this bother you but no one else?", "NTA. The confrontation wasn\u2019t the best, but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. They\u2019re grown adults, they know they don\u2019t need to scream in a restaurant.

In general I think we should handle *more* potential conflicts on our own, calmly and considerately, instead of shunting them off onto underpaid workers or armed cops.", "But no one has an accurate radar for who the rational adults are and who the freaking psychos are. I live in Texas, I assume everyone I pass by or interact with is concealed carrying a hand gun at minimum. Heck no I\u2019m not gonna confront strangers who might be just crazy enough to wait for me in the parking lot to give me a piece of their mind in the form of a bullet. Or follow me home and do it there. It\u2019s sucky that it has to be that way, but a lot of adults DONT know how to act in public and if I have no authority in a public environment then I will find someone that does (and probably gets paid to) to handle it. I don\u2019t think OP is an asshole, but I also wouldn\u2019t encourage people to do what they did, especially not in my neck of the woods.", "Agreed, and that way the restaurant would have had some control and responsibility for the $70 they lost.  This scenario just sucks for the restaurant.", "Exactly! Maybe the grandmother was hard of hearing", "Agree. She made herself the volume police and came up with this rule that \"adults shouldn't be louder than the kids they're with\" which is her rule only. I say that as someone who doesn't really like loud people, but I don't get to dictate what other people do.
