{"id": 33382, "submission_id": "18mden4", "title": "AITA for not using my cousin's current name?", "selftext": "My cousin (22MTF) came out as transgender roughly a year ago to most of the family. No big deal for most of us. Since then they have been swapping names fairly regularly (like every few weeks) and while I (26m) try to keep up, I am usually behind due to not seeing them frequently. Again, not a big deal.\n\nNow the issue is, our Grandmother passed a couple weeks ago. Shortly after my cousin decided to take her name as their new name. I learned this at a family get together this last weekend. I found this to be disrespectful to us to expect to call them her name while we are still in grief and refused to use that name instead using the previous one that I knew. This upset my cousin and her parents causing tension between our families.

A year later this might have been okay, but so soon is really tough on everyone around her.", "I'd be tempted to start calling them \"Cousin\" for now. That's not changing.\n\nThen, when they'd settled on a name for maybe a year or so, I'd probably start calling them that.\n\nDon't think there are any As here, just some confusion born of who knows what.", "NTA as a trans person I understand finding the right name is a process but I've only changed mine once. And it seems insensitive and attention seeking to pick your recently dead grandmas name. Soemone needs to send your cousin to therapy tbh.", "NTA given how fresh this is.  You might try just calling them Couz or Cousin till things settle down.", "NTA - I mean, if theyre changing names every few weeks people are going to get it wrong. \n\nYou were a bit pre-mediated in this error, but\u2026 eh. Sounds exhausting.", "trans person here, NTA because   \n1. you're still using a correctly gendered name I assume. and  \n2. They change it every few weeks as it is.   \n\n\nI think this is just your cousin grieving and I think its actually a really sweet way of them to honour your grandmother in their own way. I can also understand why you find it a bit too soon. Everyone deals with grief differently and thats okay too.  \n\n\nI think you would be the Asshole if this is the name that sticks for her and you refuse to use it then", "NTA - it sounds like your cousin is just desperate to get attention rather then trying to find their personal identity.", "NTA - your cousin needs therapy", "NTA- someone needs attention.", "NTA, just don\u2019t use their dead name/ name that they feel goes against their gender identity \nEx: calling ur cousin \u201cJim\u201d (a traditional male name) if they stopped identifying as male\nCould call that person \u201ccuz\u201d or \u201ccousin\u201d to keep it neutral without using ur grandmas name", "NTA\n\ni would\u2019ve given up and called her cuzzo at this point.", "NTA.\n\nWTF. Just 'cause you cousin came out as trans, doesn't mean that they're entitled to stealing the grandmothers last name.\n\nAbsolutely appalling OP. Stand your ground. Don't let your cousin overpower you.", "Tell them you will just be referring to them as Cousin until they have settled on a name for >1 year or gotten it legally changed", "Nta but your cousin is a giant one tell her you will never call her by your grandmother's name and to stop name swapping as it annoying.", "NAH. You're both grieving. Your cousin may have thought taking your grandmother's name would be something to honor her but the timing is bad and you were hurt by it, and you may have likewise hurt your cousin but that doesn't make either one of you TA. Grief is hard and everyone handles it differently.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin is a Narcissist.", "I don't agree with the practice of changing your name like a hat, and in particular it seems like she's trying to put attention on herself right now by insisting on adopting your grandmas name right now.\n\nBut you're opening a bigger can of worms than is necessary by refusing their preferred name. As annoying as it is, control over what people call you is a much bigger deal to 99% of trans people than it is to 99% of cis people. One day your cousin is going to look back on this and say \"that was so cringey that I took my dead grandma's name for a month,\" but you're not able to make her realize that now. Probably, no one is.\n\nSo overall NTA, but suck it up and call her by her preferred name anyway.", "NTA, but I don't think your cousin is either. You're both grieving, and her way of grieving is naming herself after a family member that she loves and respects (a common practice, at least in my family, to name a baby after someone who has passed but held importance). You're not comfortable calling her by this name, but you are not misgendering her (I assume). The lines get blurry when you're grieving.", "NAH. You\u2019re obviously being supportive of your cousin generally, but it\u2019s a lot to expect people to remember a different name every time they see you - though I can understand choosing a forever name for yourself is probably a hard choice. I also understand wanting to honour someone you loved by taking their name, but springing that on the family so soon is insensitive to everyone else\u2019s grief. Respect needs to be mutual.", "NTA- as per other comments your cousin clearly wants attention. Call them person formally known as whatever their original name is.", "Hard no on calling your cousin by your grandmother\u2019s name. She has mental health issues, don\u2019t entertain the behavior.", "NTA, it is very selfish of them to take grandmother name so soon after their passing. By the sounds of it too, they're not even at the stage of being MTF so perhaps they need help choosing a permanent name that suits them.", "Eesh \n\nGrief is weird and I think that this is her way of trying to cope. But also it\u2019s VERY weird to take your deceased loved one\u2019s name so soon. I feel for you both but this is tricky. \n\nI think you could have approached it differently and been like, \u201cthis is really hard for me because it brings a wave of grief everytime I hear the name/have to say it. I love you and support you but the name is too hard to use can I find a compromise or use a preferred nickname or middle name?\u201d", "Your cousin needs to speak to a therapist. Not because they\u2019re trans, but because they seem to be really struggling with their identity (changing their name constantly) and needs to speak to someone who can guide them.", "NTA. Your cousin at 22 has a brain that literally is not fully developed. Give them grace. Kids at that age are selfish, and that's what this is. It's not about them, they need to get over themselves. Give the family time to grieve, then give them more time to adjust to the new name and gender. It takes time. It's not going to happen overnight. It happens organically. Also, taking the name of the person who *just* passed is off-putting. I would say the same if someone named their baby the same name at the same time. It's a big move and hard to accept immediately while you're in the throws of Grief.", "NTA, bros a weirdo for that", "NTA, \n\nI have transgendered family, and people who have changed their names. \n\nIt's not disrespectful in the sense that you all are grieving, but they did have in their heart that they want the same name as her, it is only disrespectful if they continue to change it. But at the moment you did the right thing by telling them that it was wrong. \n\nPeople often honor their loved ones and passed loved ones with giving the same names or middle names of those who passed which I think that's what they meant to do. \n\nYou're not the Asshole for grieve is never gone it just gets small enough to handle.  I'm sorry for your loss.", "Mild YTA. It sounds like your cousin is honouring your grandmother by choosing the name. If it\u2019s really too difficult for you, call her by a nickname.", "I definitely see where grieving can come in to play, if your cousin is bouncing from name to name, this might just be another phase and grief does crazy things to people. Not saying it\u2019s ok to ignore family but I know it can be confusing. I think calling them a nickname could be a good substitute. Personally I was just called by my last name until I decided on a first name.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin taking your dead grandmother's name like that is both disrespectful and creepy", "Until u change it legally", "ESH bc they picked a name which you already know and that should be what you call them, even if it\u2019s your late gma\u2019s name and you\u2019re uncomfortable and grieving, but also they can\u2019t expect everyone to be able to keep up with names if they keep changing it often and you don\u2019t keep in touch like that.", "NTA \nYour cousin sounds mentally ill.", "YTA\n\nOnly a little bit, but still. What does your mourning have to do with their name, really? Where is that offensive to you? If you find it offensive they chose a new name they may find it offensive that you simply reject using it. It goes both ways.", "INFO. on a scale from Kate to Eowin how common is this name. because y t a if it's at Kate level, and n t a if it's super obscure", "YTA.  1) did you call your grandma by her first name? 2) I\u2019d be glad that someone loved grandma enough to want to hear her name every day", "Just put the cousin formally known as before her old name.  Technically it is correct.", "NTA. That reads as really tone deaf. I get wanting to honor your grandma and I understand different people have different methods for grief, but IMO there\u2019s much more effective ways of honoring her than *changing your name during a grieving period* to match *the deceased*. This is hopefully just some insensitive timing, but I\u2019d keep the possibility of her just taking the name \u2728just cuz\u2728 open", "No", "From the headline I really expected some transphobic bullshit. Clearly you have no problem with her being trans or changing her name, but every few weeks? That's ridiculous, and I doubt you'd behave any differently towards a cisgender person who changed their name weekly\n\nNTA", "NTA", "I refuse to accomodate people who make my life difficult.

It's not like you're dead naming them right - they seem to be trying on different names, and you're finding this one disrespectful since they justt chose it and youre still mourning. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour cousin is an entitled, selfish narcissistic brat whos clearly using your grandmothers death as a \"look at me\" moment. Absolutely disrespectful. You need to tell your cousin outright that shes made an incredibly selfish decision and she cant use her transgender identity against her family to guilttrip you into calling her by your dead grandmothers name or you won't acknowledge her anymore.", "Even a year later, or at any point in time really, renaming yourself after your dead grandma is not ok. Doing so is weird, unusual, and unnecessary to living.", "Just calling them \u201cCousin\u201d is giving Carmy and Richie from \u201cThe Bear\u201d \ud83d\ude02 I mean, it works 1000%.", "That's what I do with my trans cousin, who switched names like 14.8 million times.\n\nIt's a descriptor that works for everyone.", "This is the best solution.", "Yep. The cousin I'm closest with calls me \"cuz\" affectionately. Hard to find fault with that.", "Yes! I couldn't imagine changing my name every few weeks. That definitely screams attention seeking. \n\nI get trying to come up with a new name, the right name that fits you.

I renamed myself due to a lot of childhood trauma that unfortunately impacted my perception of identity with my birth name (plus\u2026 it was a shitty name), and alongside a new forename and surname, I gave myself a middle name (I had never had one before) - my grandmother\u2019s name. The people who loved her were touched by my choice and considered it a sign of love and respect for her.\nI suppose it depends on the circumstances and why, but immediately after someone\u2019s passing is absolutely not the time to decide on that name, and in the unfortunate event that the name was already chosen prior to the passing\u2026 Wait to announce it.\n\nETA: My grandmother died when I was 7 years old and I renamed myself when I was 19 years old.
