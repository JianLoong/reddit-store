I landed a great job with a decent salary, which has finally allowed me to have some financial stability.\n\nHere\u2019s where the conflict arises, though.

Second, something like \"social media influencer\" mostly sounds like he wants an extended vacation at your expense while he makes silly faces at his phone.  What is his \"hook\" - that certain *something* that will differentiate him from the literally millions of people doing the same thing?   \n\nHowever, if you absolutely CANNOT refuse your brother, then treat this as an arm's length investment with a stranger.  First things first:  require a business plan from him, showing a coherent strategy, use of funds, capital equipment needs, required expenses, projected sources of revenue,  corporate structure, bookkeeping plans, etc.  If he cannot put together a well-thought out and written plan, *how can he be competent enough to run a business*?  And that's what this is...or supposed to be.  \n\nMake it clear that this will either be an investment, or a loan.  If it is an investment, you should require, IN WRITING, a specified rate of return, and that you get paid first before he takes any salary or dividends.  If it is a loan, specify the interest rate and terms of repayment, but again, IN WRITING.  Also as part of the loan document, require that all of the business equipment purchased, as well as any personal assets he might have (such as a car or computer, jewelry, tv, etc.  He can't have much if he's coming to you) are pledged as collateral on the loan.  In other words, he defaults (fails to pay) on the loan, you can legally seize the collateral.  \n\nIf he is serious, he will buckle down and at least attempt to be a professional about it.  My guess is that he has not thought at all what it means to run a business, and will object to your \"overly strict\" demands.   However, you are not asking for anything that a bank or a neutral investor wouldn't also require.  Don't give in to his whining.\n\nQuite frankly, OP, I don't feel you should even open the door to being an investor or a lender.  **You should simply tell him \"No.\"**  But if you do go down that path, your perfectly legal, logical, and sensible requirements of a written plan, and written documentation of your investment/loan (use an attorney!), will very likely be more than enough to dissuade him.  You can choose to be supportive, but you don't have to be a blind fool about it.  \n\nNTA", "You offered him genuine help. He wants to mooch off your hard earned money instead of. NTA", "NTA.

And he won't gain a lot of followers unless his followers share. \n\nI would have asked for a business plan so he could say \"uh, I don't have or need one\". From there it would be \n\nhow many followers do you have?\n\nHow many followers and likes do you need to make $1000?\n\nHow much do you expect to spend on the first few trips? \n\nHow many trips each month? \n\nWhat countries and cities do you think will get the most from your followers? How much does a hotel cost there? What is the budget for each trip. \n\nIt is easier to show someone they are not prepared than it is to convince them. And if he wants to spend $2000 getting to Paris, $2000 on a hotel, and $4000 on food and high end marketable activities, he will need a shit ton of folders to pay for that, and make enough money to live on. \n\nSay he starts small, and spends $5000 on his first. If he needs 500,000 likes to make that, then he will need over 800,000 followers to just break even. More if he wants to pay his electric bill. \n\nThat is where you tell him to talk to you when he has 500,000 followers. \n\nIf he comes asking or complaining again, ask him the questions! You can show him why he isn't prepared for the high end travel market. \n\nAnd if he has viewership, he can get a charge card to finance the trip and pay it off when his millions come in.\n\nBut yeah, I would not invest in that unless he was almost to the point where he could pull it off. There is not a magic button he can push that will make 800000 people give him likes just because he spent money. \n\nNta.", "oh definately NTA.  he's a blood sucker in training.  Stop that rubbish down right from the start.", "NTA \n\nOp, you get to be selfish ITS YOUR MONEY, not his you don\u2019t have to share. Especially for the him to be come an influencer.\n\nIt should noted that most influencers started with very little and worked hard to get to the place where they can travel , it\u2019s insane that he thinks he can just take a bunch of money and jump into an already saturated field. \n\nOp, I\u2019d like to ask has your brother ever been there for you, if roles were reversed would he have already sent you the money ? \n\nI ask because usually when someone pulls the family card and always there for each other , that person has never been there for anyone but themselves.", "NTA - it\u2019s your money and you can invest it how you like. If he wants to be an influencer, he can do it as a side hustle like anyone else who isn\u2019t independently wealthy.", "lol NTA your brother just asked you if he could be a professional idiot with you paying the bill. What kind of moron would say yes to this stupidity?", "NTA. First, never lend anything you can't afford to give. Especially to family. Second, your brother sounds like he wants to be a professional freeloader. I mean does he have a talent? Does he have a special style? Has he dated a Kardashian?  He needs to figure out his hook and start posting. You are not responsible for funding anyone's dream but yours and your future children.", "NTA and yeesh OP, you're being far too diplomatic regarding this topic.\n\nMy dream is also to dick around, travelling the World on someone else's dime. Anyone want to Venmo me the cash now or can I expect a direct bank transfer?", "ahahahahahahahahahahaha.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to help, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t want to waste your money.\n\nPeople who have a \u201cdream\u201d are usually willing to work hard to realize that dream. That includes taking $h!t jobs to pay the bills and giving up sleep, fun, whatever to research, etc. to make it happen. Your brother doesn\u2019t sound like a good investment.", "Ludicrous.\n\nNTA.\n\nOh, OP, will you be MY patron? I'd love to travel the world and go to fun and exotic places on someone else's dime.  I mean, that makes sense, right? That's a thing, right?", "NTA. Few people make a living as social media influencers. He wants you to pay for an extended vacation that he may or may not put online in the hopes that it makes money. His plans are shaky to nonexistent. You have everything to lose and he gets a paid trip.", "Oh hell no!!  Do you have any idea how many people try this route and fail miserably?  You would just be lighting money on fire.  Your offer to help with his GED is valid and he\u2019s not smart for not taking that opportunity.  NTA", "NTA\n\nUntil you get yourself fully sorted & financially stable, you shouldn't be giving large amounts of money to a risky endeavor. Giving that money is how you stay in a poverty/not having much cycle despite the college education & good job.\n\n The ways that you've offered to help are reasonable. Offering money that you can pay directly to his school (so he can't blow or mismanage what you give him) is ok. You could even bring up the idea of him going to trade school instead of regular college after finishing his GED. His request is unrealistic. You being 24 with the first good salary job isn't a good time to be giving out that much money for an unsure thing. Don't give him money for anything unless he shows you a thorough plan of action with a matching budget.", "NTA, hes either a naive idiot or is just trying to scam some money out of you to take some free trips.", "LMAO NTA!\n\nYOU deserve a trip for graduating with honors.  He wants to have fun on your dime.\n\nYou offered him a path to being about to afford that dream himself, but he was the easy way.\n\nNo. no. No today. Not tomorrow.\n\nYou need to set the boundary on money now, because he will always the there with his hand out. He\u2019s done 0 work, but thinks he deserves lavish trip. He\u2019s delusional.", "You're being taken advantage of. Working isn't his thing? Is eating his thing? Having a roof over his head? Oh right, YOU work for those things, not him! \n\nDon't entertain this at all. If he wants to life that life, he can figure out a way to make it happen. Wanting to flaunt YOUR money and pretend to have a life he doesn't isn't a dream, it's a joke.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  And let go of the guilt.  There\u2019s a huge difference between needs and wants.  Your brother **wants** to be a social influencer.  He just doesn\u2019t want to have to fund his own journey of discovery.  He\u2019s asking you to fund his vagabond lifestyle.  And he sees you as his best shot at never having to actually work.  Don\u2019t sacrifice your own financial stability to pay for your brother to travel the world on your dime.", "NTA. Don't give a red cent to your brother, make him go back to school for his GED.", "No.  No way.  This is like asking for a significant amount of money for a high school drop out so he can go to Hollywood, pay for a condo with a view and a cool wardrobe, and become a movie star.\n\nBeing there for your family does not involve throwing significant sums of money at a person who isn't sufficiently committed to his  Dream to do the work to be able to support and launch it.  (Hence the concept of the day job.)\n\nStick with your support of your brother either getting a GED or enrolling in a vocational training program.  That's it.  \n\nThe reason your brother is experiencing the time of need he wants you to throw money at is that he's a high school drop out with zero job skills or willingness to work (apart from posting videos of himself in exotic locales).  Do not subsidize this!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA.   Like any other entertainment career (including sports in this), the chances of making it big are astronomical.  For every success there are hundreds or thousands of failed dreams.\n\nOffering to help him get a real job that he can use to fund his dream is reasonable.  Paying for him to find himself is not.", "NTA \n\nMy dad always says don't lend money you can't afford to lose in case the person is unable/unwilling to pay you back. In your case here, your brother may intend to pay you back but the venture he chose is not stable and he may not be able to. \n\nYou also get to spend your money how you see fit and are allowed to have boundaries such as \"I will loan up to a certain amount and not more.\" \"I will loan momey for education but not for vacations.\" \n\nYour brother's attitude is really crappy and his strategy is not too smart. How will calling you selfish inspire you to change your mind? You're right, he needs education because he's acting a fool. \n\nKeep your boundaries. If this is truly his dream, he will find a way to make it happen. Has he even made any content that people are responding to, or did he basically ask you to finance his traveling? \n\nIt's common for people with bad boundaries to pitch a fit when you communicate your own boundaries. A healthy response on his part would be, \"Okay, I understand. Thanks for thinking about it and for the feedback.\" Guilting you that family is always there is manipulative. You *are* there for him and did offer him to find ways to get a day job while he makes his influencer gig happen (which most influencers do). He didn't want it so that's his choice. Be there for family doesn't mean having no boundaries. It can include doing what you did here which is sharing your wisdom while kindly but firmly saying no.", "NTA. Your brother has dropped out of school and now he wants his sibling to dump a significant amount on some hairbrain scheme. Don't do it. Your parents are right, the way to a better life is through education. And your brother is an ungrateful person.", "Lol.  Not the ah", "NTA. People don\u2019t invest in becoming a so-called influencer. He would build his own base first, establish that there is legit potential, and go from there. 99.9% of people can\u2019t monetize their social media to be self-supporting, and most who do have their 15 minutes of fame. Don\u2019t waste your hard-earned money on this, please.", "Don't do it.  If he needs money to fake a lifestyle he cannot afford to  be a social media influencer then he wouldn't be successful anyway. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nDon't lend someone money that you can't afford to give/lose.", "NTA\nThe moment I read influencer", "NTA.  add trade school to the list of things you\u2019d support him in.  once he gets on his feet he can support his own dreams", "Yeah, traveling instead of working is most people dream\n\nThat's why it's a dream, not a proper plan if life", "NTA\n\nYour brother is taking advantage, and not likely to succeed.", "YTA - for wasting my time reading this story that has an obvious answer.", "Jesus God, of course you're NTA.\n\nYou might as well give him money to try and make his fortune in Vegas, or panning for gold.\n\nYour offer was very generous. And his reaction to your refusal shows what he's made of, and should only serve to reinforce your decision.", "Bumping this so OP sees this. I work in social media; it\u2019s a great gig in a lot of ways. I also have a master\u2019s degree, nearly 20 years\u2019 experience in communications and marketing and only work with influencers who can be similarly professional and authentic.", "NTA\n\nHow is he going to target or reach demographics? \n\nHow is he going to monetise this? \n\nDoes he have the knowledge and skills for media creation? It's not just point phone and record. He needs to curate his content, he needs a perfected brand, recognition. He needs to be able to edit content even 2 or 3 short videos, 3 minutes a piece showcasing that he can create transitions, clarity, focus, he can setup a shot, lighting, camera angles and different lenses for varied shoots, has he costed equipment at all? \n\nSound mixing, special effects, overlays, intros and exits.\n\nDoes he even have a space he wants to create content about? And if so, why isn't he just doing that now? What will new locations and travel give him? \n\n\nCan he draw attention to or lead people to something( like advertiser's/products/sponsors). How is he going to get them on board? \n\nMost advertisers, sponsors want an existing brand to launch off of, they pay a pittance to \"the influencer\" for them to advertise products and access their ready made audience. But they won't work with someone who has noone following them or even very few( and under 30k is tiny amounts of income). They aren't gonna pay someone to create a new brand a someone else to eventually advertise their products. \n\nFor every successful influencer, there are 10,000 failed ones who don't make a cent but *want* to be famous like the ones they idolise and want to copy. \n\nHe's looking for a jet setter party time lifestyle, but the people who lived that way had multi-multi-millionaire parents bankrolling everything. Wall street investors at 24 who make multi-millions themselves don't spend money that way. And he can't compare himself to kim Kardashian as an influencer coz she had 20+ seasons of a tv show and was spotlight by way of her dad. \n\nThe real pay for influencers is by the 1000s or 10,000s of followers they get a few, but it's like getting $5 for 30,000 followers if you make 6 videos and we can trace some sales back to you.", "This!!!!!", "Nail==>Head\n\nNTA", "It's not even a plan b, not in the oversaturated influencer market. More like a \"plan m\" or something.\n\nMost really successful influencers had 1-2 real jobs until their business took off and could support them fully.", ">If your brother's business plan had merit he could get a small business loan.\n\nHit the nail on the head right here. From OPs story, I very much doubt any real business plan was laid out to begin with.", "This. Be clear with your brother that supporting him would require giving up your own dreams. It is not your responsibility to carry your sibling. Once you start, he will expect you to finance his life indefinitely. NTA", "Yeah I'd ask to see a professional business plan and a history of content creation. What's stopping him from doing local travel content with free/cheap equipment to start?", "Seriously, he's got a pipe dream. I think really trying to get the brother to get his GED would be the best investment in your family. Steer him towards doing the GED classes at a local community college. A lot of those colleges will provide scholarships first year of community college classes for free depending on how well he does on the GED. That will be signing him up for success!"]}
