I never thought I\u2019d be posting here, but here goes . . .\n\nSo, some BG: I come from a family that has always struggled financially. We\u2019ve never had much, and my parents worked hard to make ends meet. They\u2019ve always emphasized the importance of education, and it was drilled into my head that getting a college degree is the key to a better life.\n\nFast forward to the present: I am the first person in my family to attend college, and I recently graduated with honors. I landed a great job with a decent salary, which has finally allowed me to have some financial stability.\n\nHere\u2019s where the conflict arises, though. My little brother (20F) dropped out of HS a few years ago, and has been struggling to find his way ever since. He\u2019s been working odd jobs, but hasn\u2019t found anything stable.\n\nHe recently approached me, asking for help to get back on his feet.\n\nInitially, I felt sympathetic and wanted to support him. I offered to help him enroll in a GED program, pay for the classes, and even help him find a job once he\u2019s done. But, here\u2019s the thing \u2014 he refused. He told me that he doesn\u2018t want to go back to school/work a regular job because he believes it\u2019s \u201cnot his thing\u201d.\n\nInstead, he asked if I could lend him a significant amount of money to pursue his dream of becoming a social media influencer. He wants to travel, create content, and make a living out of it. Now, I understand that social media can be a legitimate career for some people, but it\u2019s risky, and success is far from guaranteed.\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the AH. I told him that I\u2019m not comfortable giving him such a large sum of money for an uncertain endeavor. I explained that I worked hard to get where I am, and I don\u2019t want to jeopardize my financial stability by making a risky investment. I suggested he explore more realistic options, like getting his GED/finding a stable job, but he got upset with me.\n\nHe accused me of being selfish, unsupportive, and not understanding his dreams. He said that \u201cfamily should always be there for each other\u201d and \u201chelp in times of need\u201d. Now, I feel guilty, but also like I\u2019m being taken advantage of.\n\nSo, Reddit; AITA?", "created_utc": 1703891079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18u06ap/aita_for_refusing_to_put_money_on_my_brothers/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Second, something like \"social media influencer\" mostly sounds like he wants an extended vacation at your expense while he makes silly faces at his phone.  What is his \"hook\" - that certain *something* that will differentiate him from the literally millions of people doing the same thing?   \n\nHowever, if you absolutely CANNOT refuse your brother, then treat this as an arm's length investment with a stranger.  First things first:  require a business plan from him, showing a coherent strategy, use of funds, capital equipment needs, required expenses, projected sources of revenue,  corporate structure, bookkeeping plans, etc.  If he cannot put together a well-thought out and written plan, *how can he be competent enough to run a business*?  And that's what this is...or supposed to be.  \n\nMake it clear that this will either be an investment, or a loan.  If it is an investment, you should require, IN WRITING, a specified rate of return, and that you get paid first before he takes any salary or dividends.  If it is a loan, specify the interest rate and terms of repayment, but again, IN WRITING.  Also as part of the loan document, require that all of the business equipment purchased, as well as any personal assets he might have (such as a car or computer, jewelry, tv, etc.  He can't have much if he's coming to you) are pledged as collateral on the loan.  In other words, he defaults (fails to pay) on the loan, you can legally seize the collateral.  \n\nIf he is serious, he will buckle down and at least attempt to be a professional about it.  My guess is that he has not thought at all what it means to run a business, and will object to your \"overly strict\" demands.   However, you are not asking for anything that a bank or a neutral investor wouldn't also require.  Don't give in to his whining.\n\nQuite frankly, OP, I don't feel you should even open the door to being an investor or a lender.  **You should simply tell him \"No.\"**  But if you do go down that path, your perfectly legal, logical, and sensible requirements of a written plan, and written documentation of your investment/loan (use an attorney!), will very likely be more than enough to dissuade him.  You can choose to be supportive, but you don't have to be a blind fool about it.  \n\nNTA", "You offered him genuine help. He wants to mooch off your hard earned money instead of. NTA", "NTA. Why should your hard work finance a vacation for him? Does he even have a social media presence with followers?", "NTA - let me cut through all of his BS for you:\n\n*He said that \u201cfamily should always be there for each other\u201d and \u201chelp in times of need\u201d.*\n\nFirst, family should be there for each other but it no way does it say that family should fork over a large sum of money on a whim.  You giving him options is being there for him.\n\nAlso, he doesn't need \"help\" per se.  He just has wants, not needs at this point.\n\n100% he needs his high school diploma before he can even think of entering the real world.  Unless he as a superior set of skills that others do not have, he's not really going to go too far in life.  If you really want to help him, find out why he is so adamant about not getting a High School Diploma.", "NTA - You should give the money to me instead!", "NTA - it\u2019s not about the career topic? he wants, but the fact it sounds like he has no business plan, forecasting or planning for how he would spend your investment (likely that\u2019s he\u2019ll use that as the salary). \nIf he asked you to invest in any other business then it would need to be a sound investment", "NTA You were a good sibling offering to help him get his GED, but \u201cinfluencer\u201d is such a gamble it\u2019s probably not worth it.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. You are under no obligation to financially back high-risk, very poor decisions. You *did* offer to help him with something worthwhile that you considered practical, based on your own experience. \n\nIf he's looking for investors, family or otherwise, he has to understand that there are people who will make high-risk investments who are willing to lose everything for high rewards if it works out. And there are people who are risk-averse, who need to have a sure-fire bets, like education and government bonds.", "Normally when we lend money to a person or organisation, we need assurances that we would get the money back. How long has this been his dream, what assurances are there that he will continue down this path and put in the work necessary to reach the point of making a living from it. Has he got skills, a business plan, understanding of the numbers of followers he'd need in order to recoup sufficient to live, create more content and repay you, a timeframe for the repayment? \n\nNot to mention, significant amounts of money between siblings or friends is risky, because when things go wrong over repayment or terms or a request for further loan it can harm a relationship.

As a management  consultant, I work with lots of obscenely rich people, and lots of their kids are influencers.  They're the kind that have 6 and 7 figure followers and get major brand sponsorships.  Everyone they know thinks they're super successful.  \n\n\nIn reality, mommy and daddy bankroll their lives still, bc they don't make enough to actually do all the travel and partying they do.  It's literally a con for clout using daddy's credit card. Freelance tax structures suck balls. The market is sooo saturated \n. And, no one realizes the insane amount of work that goes into a successful Chanel/account.  \n\nA poor kid is more likely to get rich by having a BMW run him over than he is to become a influencer who can support himself for a lifetime or even a year."]}
