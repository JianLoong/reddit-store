My stepdad, for years, has tried to take over as the dad in my life. He wanted to adopt me and change my name. He tells people I'm his daughter and that he's my dad. My mom does the same. She was really angry with me for a couple of years for putting an end to the adoption dream. They decided that Leah didn't need to know and so they have always told her we're full sisters and it just took them a while to have her. Leah has often questioned why I call her dad by his name. It has always been something I have told my mom and stepdad they need to fix because I would tell her the truth some day. They said I was not allowed to. That I could see this as a chance to let my stepdad be just my dad and to stop with the childish nonsense that I have been keeping up for the last decade.\n\nLeah grew more and more questioning about it. So a few weeks ago after telling my mom it would happen, I told her the truth. I showed her photos of my dad. Told her I still loved her. But that her dad was not mine. She asked if I disliked her dad. I told her simply he could never replace my dad. She told me she'd feel the same way if hers died and mom remarried. I told her I was glad she understood. She asked me if it made me sad or mad when people said the wrong thing about him being my dad. I said it did. That I didn't like it much but that I tried not to hold it against people. \n\nWhen my mom and stepdad realized I told Leah they were so angry. I was grounded for three weeks for going against them and for putting Leah in a bad situation. I argued back at the time that they were the ones who lied. My stepdad said it was not a lie because despite legally and biologically not being my dad, he was the one who was there, he would be the one walking me down the aisle one day, he would be grandpa to my future children, he's the one who will have been my dad for more than a decade. I told him he'll always be my stepdad of a decade or two decades or three decades but the step will always be there.\n\nThey're still angry and they upset Leah by correcting her and trying to make her call her dad my dad.

If she\u2019s pushing this, talk to her about how *your* relationship with your dad wasn\u2019t *her* relationship with him.\n\nSecond, the issue is that your stepdad seems to want to be there for you, and doesn\u2019t view you as \u201cless than\u201d your sister, but is going about relationship building in an inappropriate way (*with your mom\u2019s added support*). After you\u2019ve moved out, you all need to have an honest conversation about how you feel like this approach is an attempt to erase or replace your biological father. Once they understand where you\u2019re coming from, maybe they can resolve things without all this insane dad-pressure, but if not, at least you won\u2019t be at home during any fall-out.\n\nFor context, I have an aunt and a cousin who both went through similar strife with their stepfathers in their teens and changed their mind in adulthood. They both had healthy relationships with their stepfathers as adults. My aunt\u2019s stepdad actually just passed this year while visiting her kids and helping them landscape their house, and they were all devastated as he was a well-loved part of their lives.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think he should try and replace your dad, especially given the fact that your mom is interfering as his ex-wife. *your* relationship with your dad was great, even if *her* relationship with him wasn\u2019t.", "NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m so glad you have a step-sibling who gets it and least.", "I hate parents and step parents who do that.

Being honest is not wrong.\nHave you had any of these conversations with your mom, your stepdad, and your sister present?

That's rich coming from those two delusional liars.", "I guess you bio must have been a great father. I wonder why they got divorced?", "NTA. I'm a stepparent and I've always been big on being honest with kids as much as is age appropriate. Lying to them like this is setting them up for failure.

I was always very much a part of his life but it was always clear what my title was and there is no need to falsify it. Your mom and stepdad are being ridiculous and you did the right thing.

My husband and I started dating when she was 9mo. I could have easily told her my husband is her bio dad, but I didn't. I never hid the truth from her. I told her how my husband met us and loved us both, and he chose to be her dad. She calls him Dada, and he's the only father she's ever known, but there's no reason to lie to her. Your mom and step-dad are the AHs for trying to force this. It's even worse that you remember your dad, and they want to take that away.", "NTA Your parents are the assholes for lying to your half sister", "NTA....the child acted more has an grown up then the parents. Your stepdad loves you, thats for sure. But they shouldnt denied your own father.

While my stepfather wasn\u2019t perfect, he NEVER tried to take his place or diminish his memory in any way. \n\nYour mother and stepfather should be ashamed of themselves. It is already difficult enough to understand death as a child, let alone the death of a parent. I am still working through very intense grief at nearly 30 years old, simply because having a parent die at 10 years old is so difficult to process. The memory of my father has been kept alive primarily by my mother, despite their being divorced when he passed away. My mom is a shit parent and I still cannot fathom her behaving in this way. \n\nNever, ever let go of your father\u2019s memory and his place in your heart as your father, if that is how you feel about him, regardless of what they have to say. If you wanted your stepdad to take his place, totally fine if that is what you want. You can also have your stepdad be a dad to you while preserving and respecting the irreplaceable bond that a father and their daughter can share. The fact that this is not an option is fucking disturbing to me. You absolutely have a right to honor his life, and at the very least acknowledge the fact that he fucking existed and share that with your sister. \n\nAbsolutely NTA and I am so, so sorry for your loss.", "None of this should be anyone\u2019s fault.

While they are only a year apart, they are both a bit older than I am. Growing up, I had questioned some things - such as why do we all have different hair and eye colors, why do my sister and brother not have baby pictures like mine, why did my parents wait to get married until right before they had me? I was always given logical explanations and didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nWhen I was 15, I took biology. We started learning about dominant and recessive genes, and we used our families as examples. My teacher told me that either my siblings were adopted or they were mutants. I laughed it off, but then a month later, one of my brother\u2019s friends (who was taking an elective with me) asked how his stepmom was doing. I was so confused, and he revealed that my mother wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s \u201creal\u201d mom.\n\nLots of tears followed, and some very painful conversations. My whole world imploded - everyone in my entire family and social circle knew that my sister had a different biological father and my brother a different biological mother, and that I was their only child together. (Both of their bio parents walked out on them as toddlers, and my parents met shortly after - my sister was later adopted by my father). My parents didn\u2019t want anyone treating us differently, so they instructed everyone to keep it from me\u2026.just me. \n\nIt\u2019s unnecessary hurt inflicted by well meaning people. I\u2019m sure you understand their logic, this instinctive need to protect kids from difficult truths, but it doesn\u2019t work - it only creates pain. While I have forgiven my family, it fucked me up. If everyone you love the most can lie to you for your entire life, is there any hope for honesty from anyone else? I have severe trust issues from that revelation, and if anything, you have spared your sister additional hurt by ripping off the bandaid - because honestly, they may never have done it. \n\nYou have NO responsibility for any hurt that your sister feels. Their inability to talk openly and honestly with her, and their fear that they would fail to show her that the bonds of family are not based on biology, are what caused this.\n\nI hope all of you can heal from this, and I hope you can be there for your sister. Even more so, I hope she appreciates you for your strength and for recognizing that she deserves nothing but the truth from the people she loves.", ">My stepdad said it was not a lie because despite legally and biologically not being my dad, he was the one who was there, **he would be the one walking me down the aisle one day, he would be grandpa to my future children**, he's the one who will have been my dad for more than a decade.\n\nHe assumes a lot.

Don't ever let your mom and stepdad bully you into abandoning your integrity - this whole situation is entirely their fault. Your stepfather seems delusional about his role in your life, while your mother's behavior is probably understandable to someone with a psychology degree, but not to me.\n\nPersonally, as a 40 year old man who has three daughters, I'm surprised it took that long for this thing to come to a head. My oldest daughter is currently a couple months shy of 8 years old, and she would have been asking about the \"calling stepdad by his name\" issue for the previous 3 years at the least. I can imagine living with this secret for the last few years must have been very uncomfortable for you.\n\nNTA and I want to reiterate: your mom in wrong. It's all her and your stepdad's fault. You're doing great, kid. I wish I was that mature at 17!\n\nAlso, as someone who grew up in the shadow of a narcissistic/delusional grandparent, I want to warn you to be sparse with what you actually say to your mom and your stepdad. As you can see, their mental health is not what it should be, and they've already made numerous attempts at blaming you, a child, for their issues. Do not paint a target on yourself by being unnecessarily honest and confrontational. You're nearing adulthood, and if you make them angry, they may want to \"punish\" you by forcing you out, making ridiculous demands, declining to support your further education etc. Stay diplomatic, and spend your time making friends and reaching out to have a support network in the case of something going off rails.", "NTA Truth is unpopular, but important.", "NTA.I don't know why they can't acknowledge that you already have a dad, even though he's not physically around anymore.

From a family constellation p.o.v., keeping a history secret, when it's basically quite simple and harmless, can be hurtful for her too. How does it make her feel to be excluded from such essential information? She's already been asking questions, why can't she know?It seems you and your sister are pretty smart people, and that you love each other. You are not the one hurting her. Her parents are.\n\nI'd urge you to find professional help (maybe via school?) to solve this, some sort of family therapist, because this is something I don't recommend you going through on own.

But expecting the actual father figure who is actually the one raising you to live up to the fantasy of a dead bio dad is not really the way to go.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering. She\u2019s still NTA, and the mom and SD are still wrong. But her mom remarried when OP was 9 at the latest. Dad a bit before and mom and SD were already together. OP\u2019s knowledge of her dad comes from when she was 8. We have no way of knowing what that relationship was really like at all.", "Bad bot.", "Tell me about it. I suggested OP go NC with them once she's old enough and to gather her documents and such, and I'm getting downvoted for it! They've repeatedly harassed OP for years and doing their best to wear her down and force her to forget her dad. The mom is worse than stepdad, this is her kid and she didn't defend one bit.", "I think you are reading too much malice into it. He probably thinks of OP as a daughter and is sad that she still doesn\u2019t think of him as a father. That does not mean a replacement father. You can have more than two parental figures, just as you can have fewer than two. It wasn\u2019t appropriate of them to push the relationship farther than OP felt comfortable. But it\u2019s perfectly understandable that he wishes that OP felt the same way he does.", "Leah sounds awesome.", "Of course not ! He isn't her dad !

Are you really dismissing someone grieving the loss of a parent as a drama queen? The mom and stepdad seem more concerned about appearances and consider a blended family inferior in some way. Or perhaps mom wants to pretend her first marriage never happened because she\u2019s ashamed of her role in the divorce. \n\nEither way, they\u2019re putting their petty needs ahead of a minor who has suffered a traumatic loss.

Kidnapping isn't looked fondly upon by most people.", "How is trying to erase the existence of her biological father anything other than mentally and emotionally abusive? OP stated in another comment that before he died, her time was evenly split between both mom and dad. So this does sound like a form of abuse IMHO.", "I completely agree with this. She\u2019s a kid trying to stand up for her sister that she loves and she is admirable for doing that. But it could be a good idea for OP to also give her half sister permission to essentially pick her battles. Let her know that the love and respect she\u2019s has shown as a 10yr old shows what an incredible person she is, but that she has to live there for 8 more years and OP only has to stay for one. The 10yr old is right, but OP can help her learn to be smart about how to navigate that environment.", "So you may have never experienced a significant loss, but maybe try to have some empathy. OP is definitely not a brat from what I\u2019ve read in this post. Her unwillingness to get closer to her step father is not mentally unhinged. It\u2019s called unresolved grief, and it\u2019s a normal human emotion when a person loses someone close to them.\n\nOne more thing: Acceptance of her current family does not mean erasing her biological father\u2019s memory. OP could be cordial to or even love her stepdad without buying into their delusion that he\u2019s her actual father.", "Your experience may not be relevant to OP. Unlike most (I would hope) children who lose a parent, her mom and step dad attempted to suppress her emotions. This is similar to disenfranchised grief in that OP was not allowed to acknowledge her loss and process what it would mean for her life going forward. OP\u2019s loss may have been inevitable, but the failure of the adults in her life to allow her to grieve was not. They messed up big time and are too egotistical to recognize their failure.", "They *all* need therapy.

But those of us who\u2019ve had to learn these lessons the hard way, know all too well the motivations & manipulations of these sorts. \n\nI had a similar enough experience but it took me 40yrs to fully sus out my situation. On that journey there was a particular situation that my mothers husband kept introducing me to ppl at my dead aunt\u2019s funeral (no blood relation to him) as his daughter. I was in my 40s with a teenager. I was about to scream. Blatantly told him to stop doing that multiple times. As I was my dead aunt\u2019s niece, not his daughter.

Nopity nope nope nope. Today I\u2019m 46 with trust & abandonment issues so thick that having relationships of any kind is very very difficult.

I told him multiple times, in front of folks to stop speaking for me & to stop introducing me as his daughter. I was at my aunt\u2019s funeral, I was my aunt\u2019s eldest niece. Period. I was in my early 40s & had a teenager & was low contact w them as it was. Like just fucking stop dude. \n\nI\u2019m 46 today.

And be aware that even though you are highly aware, long term exposure to toxic narc behaviors can make you especially magnetized to those behaviors esp bc they\u2019re usually masked when you first meet a new one.

The best thing you can do as they are NOT listening to you is to simply smile and nod at them. Play along. While you are financially dependent on them they can make your life very difficult....even more so than now. Just be courteous and respectful, like you would a teacher. There's a term called \"gray rock\" that may be helpful. I wish that you could make them get how much they are hurting you but, I'm so so sorry for saying this, they don't care. They only care about this fantasy of a perfect blended family, WORSE, they want to pretend your dad never existed. And that is awful. And I'm so so sorry. When you are financially independent, it might benefit you to go low contact with them. Good luck in the future. Here's a link about gray rock below\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/health/grey-rock-method#:~:text=The%20grey%20rock%20method%20is,known%20as%20%E2%80%9Cgrey%20rocking.%E2%80%9D", "Info: do your have a relationship with your dad's family?", "He died after the separation. Maybe he was still active in her life. We don't know, because she won't say.\n\nAnd yes, step dads, to some extent, fill the role of dads. I honestly don't know why this surprises or outrages you. Just like step moms act like moms sometimes. Step dads even try to adopt their step kids. Why are you pretending you don't know, and have some issue against it? It's what we WANT step dads and step moms to do. It's really twisted to try to find sinister motives behind it.

That doesn't excuse her for not even meeting a lower standard.", "So lying to their younger child and demanding OP cover for them is a high standard?
