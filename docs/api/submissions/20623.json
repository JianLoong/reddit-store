My stepdad, for years, has tried to take over as the dad in my life. He wanted to adopt me and change my name. He tells people I'm his daughter and that he's my dad. My mom does the same. She was really angry with me for a couple of years for putting an end to the adoption dream. They decided that Leah didn't need to know and so they have always told her we're full sisters and it just took them a while to have her. Leah has often questioned why I call her dad by his name. It has always been something I have told my mom and stepdad they need to fix because I would tell her the truth some day. They said I was not allowed to. That I could see this as a chance to let my stepdad be just my dad and to stop with the childish nonsense that I have been keeping up for the last decade.\n\nLeah grew more and more questioning about it. So a few weeks ago after telling my mom it would happen, I told her the truth. I showed her photos of my dad. Told her I still loved her. But that her dad was not mine. She asked if I disliked her dad. I told her simply he could never replace my dad. She told me she'd feel the same way if hers died and mom remarried. I told her I was glad she understood. She asked me if it made me sad or mad when people said the wrong thing about him being my dad. I said it did. That I didn't like it much but that I tried not to hold it against people. \n\nWhen my mom and stepdad realized I told Leah they were so angry. I was grounded for three weeks for going against them and for putting Leah in a bad situation. I argued back at the time that they were the ones who lied. My stepdad said it was not a lie because despite legally and biologically not being my dad, he was the one who was there, he would be the one walking me down the aisle one day, he would be grandpa to my future children, he's the one who will have been my dad for more than a decade. I told him he'll always be my stepdad of a decade or two decades or three decades but the step will always be there.\n\nThey're still angry and they upset Leah by correcting her and trying to make her call her dad my dad.

Once they understand where you\u2019re coming from, maybe they can resolve things without all this insane dad-pressure, but if not, at least you won\u2019t be at home during any fall-out.\n\nFor context, I have an aunt and a cousin who both went through similar strife with their stepfathers in their teens and changed their mind in adulthood. They both had healthy relationships with their stepfathers as adults. My aunt\u2019s stepdad actually just passed this year while visiting her kids and helping them landscape their house, and they were all devastated as he was a well-loved part of their lives.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think he should try and replace your dad, especially given the fact that your mom is interfering as his ex-wife. *your* relationship with your dad was great, even if *her* relationship with him wasn\u2019t.", "NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m so glad you have a step-sibling who gets it and least.", "I hate parents and step parents who do that.

It is already difficult enough to understand death as a child, let alone the death of a parent. I am still working through very intense grief at nearly 30 years old, simply because having a parent die at 10 years old is so difficult to process. The memory of my father has been kept alive primarily by my mother, despite their being divorced when he passed away. My mom is a shit parent and I still cannot fathom her behaving in this way. \n\nNever, ever let go of your father\u2019s memory and his place in your heart as your father, if that is how you feel about him, regardless of what they have to say. If you wanted your stepdad to take his place, totally fine if that is what you want.

Growing up, I had questioned some things - such as why do we all have different hair and eye colors, why do my sister and brother not have baby pictures like mine, why did my parents wait to get married until right before they had me? I was always given logical explanations and didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nWhen I was 15, I took biology. We started learning about dominant and recessive genes, and we used our families as examples. My teacher told me that either my siblings were adopted or they were mutants. I laughed it off, but then a month later, one of my brother\u2019s friends (who was taking an elective with me) asked how his stepmom was doing. I was so confused, and he revealed that my mother wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s \u201creal\u201d mom.\n\nLots of tears followed, and some very painful conversations. My whole world imploded - everyone in my entire family and social circle knew that my sister had a different biological father and my brother a different biological mother, and that I was their only child together. (Both of their bio parents walked out on them as toddlers, and my parents met shortly after - my sister was later adopted by my father). My parents didn\u2019t want anyone treating us differently, so they instructed everyone to keep it from me\u2026.just me. \n\nIt\u2019s unnecessary hurt inflicted by well meaning people. I\u2019m sure you understand their logic, this instinctive need to protect kids from difficult truths, but it doesn\u2019t work - it only creates pain. While I have forgiven my family, it fucked me up. If everyone you love the most can lie to you for your entire life, is there any hope for honesty from anyone else? I have severe trust issues from that revelation, and if anything, you have spared your sister additional hurt by ripping off the bandaid - because honestly, they may never have done it. \n\nYou have NO responsibility for any hurt that your sister feels. Their inability to talk openly and honestly with her, and their fear that they would fail to show her that the bonds of family are not based on biology, are what caused this.\n\nI hope all of you can heal from this, and I hope you can be there for your sister.

As you can see, their mental health is not what it should be, and they've already made numerous attempts at blaming you, a child, for their issues. Do not paint a target on yourself by being unnecessarily honest and confrontational. You're nearing adulthood, and if you make them angry, they may want to \"punish\" you by forcing you out, making ridiculous demands, declining to support your further education etc. Stay diplomatic, and spend your time making friends and reaching out to have a support network in the case of something going off rails.", "NTA Truth is unpopular, but important.", "NTA.   \nI don't know why they can't acknowledge that you already have a dad, even though he's not physically around anymore.

From a family constellation p.o.v., keeping a history secret, when it's basically quite simple and harmless, can be hurtful for her too.

She's already been asking questions, why can't she know?   \nIt seems you and your sister are pretty smart people, and that you love each other. You are not the one hurting her. Her parents are. \n\nI'd urge you to find professional help (maybe via school?) to solve this, some sort of family council, because this is something I don't recommend you going through on own.

That\u2019s why OP is NTA and her mom and stepdad absolutely are.", "Blood isn't the only way but random redditors definitely ain't one", "From experience can tell you this now, this guy most likely isnt the picture esque dad you're probably imagining him to be. This type of demand comes with a ton of other problematic behaviours and narcissistic tendencies that already cause issues in their relationship. He's not asking her to call him dad because he sees her as his own, would do anything for her and would be there for her no matter what. He's demanding because it strokes his ego and he thinks OP owes him because he's been good enough to take in someone else's kid. \n\nI don't understand why parents do this, all it does is cause issues and stop an actual relationship forming between child and step parent because there's always a 'condition' hanging over the child's head. \n\n100% bet if OP asked her stepdad if he'd be okay with his biological daughter calling another man dad after he passed/if his wife remarried, he'd flip his shit or start making excuses.", "> then realized they hadn't really done anything I could point at.\n\nThat should have been your clue that your gut reaction was wrong.", "\u201cThey were backed into a corner, bullied into denying their own identity and strong armed by a controlling asshole.  But dang she sure is the villain here\u2026\u201d", "Agreed!  Also nothing wrong with walking down the aisle alone.  I did it and felt very happy about it.  (my dad has zero interest in me and none of my stepfathers were great)", "Im just agreeing with you....", "Exactly. You cannot rationalize with the irrational. He will NEVER acknowledge that what he's doing is wrong beyond belief. I'm just sorry that, ONCE AGAIN, the parent is putting the desires of the spouse over the needs of their child. I know if OP goes no contact they'd be all Pikachu face and wonder how they raised such an ungrateful child. OP Im sorry your mom is trying to let your stepfather erase your dad. It's not right and you have every right to make damn well sure people know you HAD a dad, you loved him, and they can't take his memory from you. NTA and please, don't antagonize them. Just gray rock them, play nice, and when you are financially able, get tf out of there and never look back. I'm so sorry your mom betrayed you like this", "Oh I like that about people doing bad sometimes unintentionally, without thinking. But they're only thinking of the step sister and not OP's feelings here. Whereas the step sister wouldn't have even cared if they were upfront from the start, she's a child it doesn't need to be a sit down talk thing, just a casual normal thing to grow up with. \n\nMe and my brother have different dad's same mums, we're full siblings! We don't say half! We have about the same age difference as op and her sister here, he was always a part of my life, my dad raised him and he calls my dad by his first name, I knew why, no big deal, no constant questioning or going on about it, he's my brother and that's that. It makes no sense how it'd be harmful to hear 'this is your mummy, daddy and sister, sister has a different daddy (he's in heaven, or whatever if even breach that subject at all!). Some people do more harm by trying to do no harm. Ugh\n\nNTA. Sorry for your loss OP, you're right he's always going to be your dad and I'm sure he'll be on your mind on your wedding day, no matter who walks you down the aisle.", "Clearly there is more to this story. If he had treated you perfectly well and was the perfect father growing up then it would be weird you were willing to die on this hill of not calling him your father. Clearly he hasn\u2019t and so it makes sense to want to cut him off.", "This sounds very extreme based on the info you've given. It seems like your step dad loves you and wants you to be a part of his life but has approached this whole thing very badly. My first reaction was that your step dad and mom need therapy but I think you also need some help. You clearly have a ton of built up resentment towards your mother and your step dad and you need to explore where that's coming from and how to move past it. That doesn't mean capitulating and pretending your step dad is your dad, but it means something other than cutting off family who you haven't otherwise said are abusive.", "I said it\u2019s not unforgivable if she doesn\u2019t want it to be. Reddit loves to tell people to go NC. She\u2019s 17. She doesn\u2019t need an entire comment section telling her to make life altering decisions based on a couple paragraphs. There are consequences to going NC. If she\u2019s ready to live with them, more power to her. But like you said, she\u2019s 17 so she may not be thinking them all the way through.", "Agreed.  Mom will be all \"Missing Missing Reasons\" (see Issendai for more).", "Yea I agree with the play nice and grey rocking them. But I want to say that this doesn\u2019t mean calling the step dad \u201cdad\u201d or any bullshit like that (which I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean but I wanted to say!). OP just needs to get along as well as she can and create as little reasons to fight back as possible until she can get herself to safety.", "Obviously all actions have consequences. In this situation, the benefits of going NC might be worth the potential negatives. OP can change her mind anytime when she\u2019s older. If her family does not welcome her back with open arms, that would confirm that she made the correct decision going NC.\n\nI would ask OP to reconsider going NC if her mom and stepdad would agree to family therapy and take it seriously. I don\u2019t see this happening, though. Given their disdain for OP\u2019s grief, they seem too emotionally inept to care about mental health.", "#He is not OP's dad. He is her stepdad", "Who the fuck are you trying to respond to?"]}
