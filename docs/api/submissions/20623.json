She was really angry with me for a couple of years for putting an end to the adoption dream. They decided that Leah didn't need to know and so they have always told her we're full sisters and it just took them a while to have her. Leah has often questioned why I call her dad by his name. It has always been something I have told my mom and stepdad they need to fix because I would tell her the truth some day. They said I was not allowed to. That I could see this as a chance to let my stepdad be just my dad and to stop with the childish nonsense that I have been keeping up for the last decade.\n\nLeah grew more and more questioning about it. So a few weeks ago after telling my mom it would happen, I told her the truth. I showed her photos of my dad. Told her I still loved her. But that her dad was not mine.

That I didn't like it much but that I tried not to hold it against people. \n\nWhen my mom and stepdad realized I told Leah they were so angry. I was grounded for three weeks for going against them and for putting Leah in a bad situation. I argued back at the time that they were the ones who lied. My stepdad said it was not a lie because despite legally and biologically not being my dad, he was the one who was there, he would be the one walking me down the aisle one day, he would be grandpa to my future children, he's the one who will have been my dad for more than a decade. I told him he'll always be my stepdad of a decade or two decades or three decades but the step will always be there.\n\nThey're still angry and they upset Leah by correcting her and trying to make her call her dad my dad.

That\u2019s insane and stupid", "NTA that man(child) is trying to fill a spot that\u2019s already filled.", "I commend you on the perfect way you explained it to your half-sister. Mom and step should be thanking you instead of grounding you for telling the truth. I can't believe that your parents don't realize that even if you were adopted, you would still have a different biological father. Your sis would most likely still would have found out. What if stepdad needed everyone to be tested for a medical reason? Anything could have brought their lies into the open. I wish the best for you and your sis.", "NTA.\nMy mother did something like this as well.\nMy oldest brother and sister are actually half siblings.\nWe have NEVER been offically told by my parents.\nI found out myself via doing some research into family history.\nI have spoken to my sister and brother about it to:\na) Make it clear they are still just as much loved and special to me.\nb) Stop them from having to keep my mothers secrets any longer.\n\nYou are very much NTA, they are the issue.\nThis is their secret, their lie and their fault.\nAlso you step dad is SUPER disrecpectful towards your actual dad and your feelings/grief.", "NTA. I have news for ya, stepdad. You won\u2019t be walking OP down the aisle if she gets married. Better hope you get invited to the wedding.", "NTA Your stepdad is in love with you and he's a psycho. Try to get out of there !!!!!!", "INFO PLEASE, just out of curiosity. I'd wanna know if your real dad did anything to \"deserve\" erasure. Even if that's the case, they can't erase YOUR personal details, who you are and where you come from. It's a very very hard NTA all the way. I just want to know what could make your current parental figures believe this selfish behavior is justified.", "NTA\nI think it\u2019s their defensive mechanism in some sort. There is definitely an underlying issue.\n\nI think your stepdad is more upset of the fact he was doing everything possible to love you and raise you like his own child.\n\nTo him you are his daughter. \n\nTo you it\u2019s different and I absolutely understand it why. \n\nI think you might better to have a chat with him (no sister, no mum involved) to discuss this.", "INFO:\nSince you put an end to the adoption by your stepdad (which I fully support you in declining) do you still have the surname of your dad or did your mom change your surname without your permission? Because if you still have the surname you were born with wouldn\u2019t your half-sister have eventually noticed and figured it out anyway?", "NTA. this would make more sense if your dad just wasn't involved, wouldn't make it right but it would make more sense. Trying to just act like your dad didn't exist or that he's not there for a reason when he died and can't be there is just so wrong and twisted. I'm sorry op that they behave this way. Walking a daughter down the aisle is a privilege and step dad needs to step back or he won't get to do that.", "Haha seriously I want to smoke what the stepdad is smoking. He seems to be way more delusional than my delusions of becoming a billionaire by 30 \u2620\ufe0f.", "So is the mom - he would not have these delusions without the approval and encouragement of the mother.  She is actually more at fault than him.", "I look just like my dad so that is highly unlikely.", "That's what I immediately thought about the walking down the aile and the grandkids thing. He has the audacity to tell her how he's going to be in her life whether she likes it or not. The sister seems like a good kid but damn do the parents suck. NTA", ">he would be the one walking me down the aisle one day, he would be grandpa to my future children, he's the one who will have been my dad for more than a decade\n\nhe's saying it all like OPs dad is a bum who just disappeared too. Like he'd be doing all these things if he wasn't *dead*", "Make sure when you leave and deny him access to your life that you\u2019re ready to actually live with the consequences of that. I\u2019m sorry your mom put you in this situation. Their refusal to allow you to have a voice is completely misguided. You were right to tell your sister the truth. And you are NTA. But it\u2019s not unforgivable if you don\u2019t want it to be. As the child of someone you refused their step parent\u2026 I can tell you that part of me struggles to forgive my father for not allowing me to have the (step)grandma that all my cousins had. I\u2019ll probably always resent it. There are consequences of your mom and step dads actions and there will be consequences of yours.", "I'm sorry to hear your mum and stepdad are doing this, families take may different forms and it's weird they're both so fixated on what your family should look like. Which results in your dad and your grief getting pushed into the back of a cupboard as a result.\n\nIt does sound like your sister is very understanding and empathetic of how you feel, and you likely helped by being kind in your explanation. I'm glad that you have your sister and that she has you.", "My gut reaction was this person was definitely the asshole but then realized they hadn't really done anything I could point at. It's just I don't like them personally. Luckily for them, I'm not their step parent", "I guarantee you the dude would go mental if OP pointed that out. Best to just do what she needs to do until she can get out and go to a college good distance away. \n\nStepfather is legit insane if he thinks he can brainwash OP to forgetting her father existed, dictate that he'll walk her down the aisle, etc.", "It's unforgivable to me how he has acted and my future kids will be better off not knowing them. They will be loved. They just won't know people who their mother cannot be around and who their mother would resent being around.", "He's not her dad. He's her stepdad. OP's dad has passed.", "Maybe you can move out already when your 18 . As an adult so you won\u2019t have to put up with this drama. I\u2019m sure all of you will have peace of mind by then ."]}
