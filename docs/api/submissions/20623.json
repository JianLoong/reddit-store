I told him he'll always be my stepdad of a decade or two decades or three decades but the step will always be there.\n\nThey're still angry and they upset Leah by correcting her and trying to make her call her dad my dad.

He isn't GOING to do sh!t!! He is your Mother's husband...not your father. \n\nReassure half sister you are sisters and will always love her. Get out of that house ASAP and cut contact with the entitled step father. And considering they are trying to force you to be his daughter they may deny you contact with your sister once you leave. But the problem is someday she will leave also. If you don't have an email she knows set one up she will be able to remember. Make sure you have a social media you never stop using. And the day you leave let her know you are there and if they ever claim you refuse contact it isn't true. Good luck and don't let mom force him on you. If she throws a fit about wedding stuff if you don't invite him....tell her she isn't welcome either . Stay strong.", "NTA.

Thats the issue with things like this, once the lie is told, undoing it becomes the problem. You just undid everything your sister knows to be true, i get why you did it, i understand, but thats a huge burden you just put on a ten year old. This is going to take a lot of honesty and a lot of deep conversations to get through, to make sure that she understands it and can be healthy with it.

He would have respected your boundary and because he understands that you're the one that decides if you want to call him dad or not. First and foremost, he's your mom's husband, and while the marriage would have made your adoption easier, you're very close to being a legal adult that you can decide not to, and it's obviously pointless at this point. Doesn't mean he's automatically your dad just because he had married your mom. I think you did good by telling your step-sister the truth, and I'm glad she's got a good head on her shoulders. DEFINITELY got that from her dad. /s What's in the dark, shall come to light.

The fact that your mom and step father have forced you to keep your dad hidden, then punish you for not going along with their erasure is objectively awful behaviour. \n\nYou and your 10 yr old half sister sound more empathetic, mature and sensible than both of them combined. I'm happy you have such a loving relationship with Leah and that she understands. With parents/step parent like that, you'll likely need each other as a support system.", "NTA it's so unfair when people try to force stuff like this ,it just doesn't work", "NTA\n\nAll your step father and mother are doing is making it impossible for you to have a relationship with him\n\nAnd because you were honest with your step sister...and she understood, they are actually harming their own relationships with their daughter because she sees you being treated unfairly for something she said she would do the exact same thing on.", "\"I'll be the one walking you down the aisle\"\n\nYeah, not necessarily dude\n\nNTA", "NTA but all I can think of is how screwed up would it be if the step-dad actually did turn out to be her biological father, and that's why they're so insistent on living this lie?", "Your NOT THE ASS!  If they want to live in their fairytale world, that\u2019s their problem.

Maybe you can talk to her . Blood is not the only way that binds family", "Make sure when you leave and deny him access to your life your sister knows she can contact you.
