There is a definite pattern here where the common factor is fairly obvious.  \n\nThat said I do not think that they need to be left out.  There should be some clear ground rules laid out to be followed if she were to be allowed back.  Basically set some house rules that address the main issues faced when she was home and not contributing and being lazy.  Beyond that I do think that a timeline is a good thing to have as your husband suggested.  She is 21 and just really starting out and does need a hand to get established and do it in the right way.   If the common behavior that keeps causing issues is not changed it will be a lifelong issue for her.

She said she considers his input (and she did kick her rent paying friend out to take his daughter in the first time), but if the house is legally hers, then she is also the one totally on the hook for the financial/legal repercussions of what happens in it.

That doesn\u2019t make for a long lasting marriage. Make a great landlord situation though.", "You very generous.   As soon as I had a FT job, I  saved and bought a car, paid my own gas, insurance, repairs,  maintenance. \n\nI did live at home  and had cheap rent though", "Actually, she said he did get a say. They both have to agree so he can't have her back without op's permission. And she said she can't bring in anyone without his permission. Sounds equal. NTA", "Because at the end of the day, that was a big part of why it went into the prenupt, which he agreed to. I got the house in a very traumatic way, it is fully paid off, and it was set up to be just mine. \n\n I pay all upkeep and maintenance on the house and we split everything else. So he doesn't pay rent/mortgage, appliances ect. We split other costs. \n\nThe house will be sold and when we buy a new house together, then that will be different, but the house and the dynamic of it was something we sat down, with a lawyer and went over.", "She also said \u201cbut at the end of the day it is my call\u201d so yeah she will \u201clisten\u201d to his input but ultimately he doesn\u2019t get a say."]}
