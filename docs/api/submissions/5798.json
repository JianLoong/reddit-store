There should be some clear ground rules laid out to be followed if she were to be allowed back.  Basically set some house rules that address the main issues faced when she was home and not contributing and being lazy.  Beyond that I do think that a timeline is a good thing to have as your husband suggested.  She is 21 and just really starting out and does need a hand to get established and do it in the right way.

Your concerns are valid - while it's your husband's daughter and he probably wants to help her, I would say it's just better to give her money to get a new place versus letting her move back in. I think you are correct in that she won't stick to the agreement.\n\nIf she does move in, write out a statement that requires her to pay a certain amount of rent as a monthly tenant and have it notarized. That way you can at least evict her if she won't move out and hold her responsible.\n\nShe also didn't run away - she's an adult, but I think she probably needs some counseling or to see a therapist.

If she can\u2019t handle her own car insurance or phone bills at the age of 21, then I am at a lost for words.   Life will not be easy because you only get more bills as you age.
