Family should be held to a higher standard than a random stranger. Family or not, you get treated the way you behave. If you make yourself unpleasant to be around, people don't want you around.", "OP. The two solutions I see from reading the comments are 1) don\u2019t let her come back or 2) let her come back with very FIRM boundaries. \n\nIn this case if she can\u2019t afford it, then she doesn\u2019t want it. A car is a privilege and unfortunately for many so is insurance. You should decide the amount but she needs to pay a certain amount of rent. That rent could even go back towards her own necessities or a savings so she can move out (if you\u2019re feeling generous ofc).", "You don\u2019t owe her s\u2026t. The question is what becomes of her. Unhappy children can cause unhappy parents. This isn\u2019t about debt, it\u2019s whether she can ever be placed on a good path. Maybe it\u2019s hopeless, but the only thing you owe is to look at it as best you can from her fathers eyes. I have no idea of any of the answers. One would have had to lived it to give you a solid worthwhile opinion. Good luck.", "By not allowing her back, you\u2019re driving a wedge in the relationship your husband has with his kid.  Essentially you\u2019re forcing him to choose between you and his kid.", "NTA. He can help her by offering to help her find a better roommate situation with individuals closer to her age. I'm concerned that her arrangement with the 40 year old co-worker includes sex or the expectation of sex. That means there is a risk of intimate violence, pregnancy, etc.", "Stop paying for her car and phone. She can start covering those bills. She can remain on your insurance until 26, I believe.\n\nShe is an adult now and with that comes all sorts of responsibilities. She messed up her 'safety net' so she'll have to grow up sooner than she'd like.", "I guess it is what it is then. The more this goes on the more i am done footing the bill for someone who regularly tells the world she hates me. \n\nThe only reason she has anything close to the life she has is me, and a pretty horrid event in my life.\n\n Her mom squatted in their last place after my husband left her. Shot their credit. This house is owned by me, in a prenupt.\n\n He doesn't pay rent or mortgage. That's why he can afford to help her as much as he does. \n\nSo, cool. I'm kind of done here, and if he isn't he can go figure that out with her.", "He is gay. Has a bf from what I know. But also in a mid life crisis.

Encourage her to make it work where she is or find another room to rent as she is not welcome back at your home.", "NTA - but it\u2019s really a question of what happens between you and your husband if you veto this idea?  She was horrible when she lived with you before so I don\u2019t blame you not wanting her back. She\u2019s likely learning strangers won\u2019t pick up after her.  You wouldn\u2019t be an AH for saying no, but how does your husband feel about that possibility?\n\nEDIT: just read your comments that your husband won\u2019t push the issue.  So enjoy your freedom and let stepdaughter learn to be a grownup!", "I admit I had a heart attack reading this as I thought it was about me for a second. I was in a very similar situation to your stepdaughter. I was 21, a college dropout, and had severe mental health issues. I moved in with my dad and his girlfriend at the time into what was formerly her home before they started dating.\n\nNTA. I brought my freaking dishes to the kitchen. I helped cook when I could (tiny kitchens are a pain for many cooks) and did chores regularly. I even tried to keep my room clean so their cat who was used to going into the room before still could. I wasn't the best houseguest - I'm sure - but I tried my best to show my appreciation despite my mental state. I knew full well I was an adult and I was in that home because of their generosity. *Especially* my dad's girlfriend as she had not signed up to live with me since my college drop out was a surprise. \n\nThe woman you described is not recognizing of the sacrifice it takes to let someone else into your home. She feels she is entitled to it. She's not going to change or learn by being let back in. It's a terrible shame and I wish her growth in her life, but that growth won't happen if she doesn't experience consequences for her actions.\n\nIf you do decide to let her back in, I strongly suggest writing out a \"rental agreement\" of sorts so she knows she can no longer leave mess in your house without risking her housing. And she certainly can't leave unattended guests. That and therapy for her, but I know that's much easier said than done.", "NTA.\n\nShe's going to end up like her mom if everyone keeps enabling her.", "NTA, make her sign a lease agreement.", "NTA, but you should make her Dad tell her that she cannot move back in because she completely abused the privledge last time and all the things she needs to improve and do for herself now she is an adult.", "She\u2019s in the lie in it phase of making her bed.

However, it may cause problems to say an unconditional no. So why not say she can sleep on the couch for a set time period. After that she gets out. But she has to clean up after herself and pay a token rent that will be given back to her so she can pay her first month's rent at her new place.", "You don't owe her shit....stand your ground.\n\nNo passes at 21...time to be treated as an adult.", "I want to hug you. This is all I have wanted and been made out to be a monster. I had a rough life, I wanted to help. But when people helped me, I was grateful, I did my best.", "Um, fully... Plenty of people are grown, independent, have families by 25.  And if she was mine, I also would tell her to figure it out. \n\nWant the truth, we won't let her be homeless, but I'm not about to tell her that. We will go pick her up at the last minute, but until then.. .", "Plus, while living with you and paying no rent she was unable to save any money!?  Time for her to grow up and stand on her own two feet.  \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling charitable you might front her the first month\u2019s rent/security deposit for her own place.  Otherwise just direct her to the classifieds on Craigslist.", "Well, don't suggest her living with the 2 of you, it won't change anything about her. She's entitled & thick-headed to think she needs to make an effort.\n\nI know you know her, but I can't get this concept she's so messed up she's close to homelessness & doesn't want to use her own $ to get out of it. She's sabotaging herself. I guess until as an addict does hitting rock bottom won't come to her senses.\n\n\\[I had been self-sufficient for many years. What caused me to go down the slippery slope was I was injured in a car accident (broke bones & lower back issues). It took longer to recover & unable to do my job with the injuries. Being I'm Type 1 diabetic I lost my benefits. It was a nightmare to get medical benefits & keep my apartment living in the NYC area one of the highest cost cities.\n\nHad I not been injured would have been able to move on w/o problem, but was. Not earning lost my entire savings paying out for bills/rent while recovering (majority took a few years). I slept in my car & motels for a few years.\n\nI ended up family/friends helped me out along with my own doctor giving me discounted meds & government training to get me out of that mess. It's been a few years later but I remember me fighting to get ahead. It's hard she has no gumption or sense of reality.\\]\n\nMy opinion/prediction:\n\nIt won't go well with her blaming others for her predicament. Already know how behaved & issues won't change. She's been disrespecting you for so long, being its your house will target you & possibly damage or steal from you. It's not worth the goodwill already tried.\n\nAs stated, *if* can put $ a security deposit or first few months (*directly to them)* in a boarding house, shelter, studio and/or cheap apartment do so. However, have it in writing & recorded that if she messes up skipping rent, utilities or gets evicted won't be there to rescue or save her (no excuses or playing a victim). She's on her own & won't be living with you. Father can do whatever, but he knows can't live in house with you & her nor use shared funds on her behalf.", ">Jer mom had a history of 3viction and squatting and knows how to work the system, and I worry she would end up doing the same.\n\nSo this is what she has learned in her 21 years - to squat and take advantage of others.  Her role model was awful and what she has learned from her only role model is awful behavior.  I'm by no means saying she should move back in with you. She has proven that she doesn't listen or care or want to learn. She does need to find out how to live with people. Maybe she can find a room to rent where the LL will have rules/boundary's. I think if you allow her to move back with you, it will be a disaster, no matter what she tells you now. You are NTA. Your step-daughter is a huge one and your husband is an enabler. Someone needs to teach her, but I don't think she will be able to learn from you. Not because you can't teach, but it sounds like she doesn't listen.", "It definitely happens that people with mental health issues resist treatment, aren\u2019t aware they need treatment. \n\nSo glad you and your husband have support, tho. It\u2019s important! \n\nThe way you describe your stepdaughter, I mean none of her habits or choices sound functional or normal. I wish there was a way to connect her with help, I can see you\u2019ve done everything you could.\n\nI don\u2019t think people like her can bootstrap it.
