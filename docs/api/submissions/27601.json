The work situation is obviously fine, there\u2019s kids everywhere, and the situation was an emergency. However, college is difficult and expensive. It\u2019s really not about how the professors feel, it\u2019s about how the other students feel. They are paying a not insignificant amount of money and putting in a lot of time and hard work, they deserve to receive the education they signed up for. A child in the classroom is a distraction, it colors the topics of conversation that can be broached, and legos are arguably quiet or not, depending on the child. Given it was temporary, I probably would let it go, but in future everyone should have more appropriate backup plans for these situations. \n\nThe classroom that is meant to serve all students shouldn\u2019t be a backup plan except in the most dire of situations and I think a day would be more understandable than an entire week. I know that will upset people but that\u2019s just my take. I understand your situation was tough and I get it, but most college students are struggling and they deserve to at least have the classroom be a space reserved for studying, discussion, and class.

Two little kids probably end up interacting with each other, and that rarely stays quiet), but as a concession to an emergency situation, I think it's fine.

She loved it and my instructor was great.", "NTA. When I was in Highschool, sometimes my teachers would bring in their kids/grandkids when they couldn't find a sitter.

Maybe he didn't make a lot of noise, but he made some. In a learning environment, people need 100% concentration. \n\nOne day may be forgiven as an emergency - but not an entire week. Whatever the family emergency was, his parents should have found suitable care for him after the first day. If nothing else was possible, you should have taken a week off and caught up later. .", "The kid is more important than the big kids in your class and he was probably better behaved. Good on both of you.", "I'm very sympathetic to the plight of student parents. it's hard and very admirable to be both raising a child and improving themselves.  that said, I had major issues with a woman who brought her baby to class. the professor quickly became distracted and didn't teach material normally covered on the course but still tested on it.  \nshe refused to sit somewhere that she could easily get up to take her baby to the hall so anytime they needed to exit (make a bottle etc) she disrupted everyone in the center of the room to the edges.  \nthe first few times everyone was understanding, even offering to help. she immediately expected anyone and everyone to pitch in however she felt like. a lot of people did substantially worse that semester after she started bringing Benny to class (I watched him enough to remember his name 10 years later but not his moms) I had no idea how common it was for people to bring their kids to class but I quickly discovered everyone i knew on campus had a horror story about a little one in class and immediately got upset when they found out they were in that situation.

It was an emergency situation and she had no choice but to bring him to class that first day. That's understandable.\n\nBut then she has all of that day and the next to figure something else out.

A lab is not a *topic* one *discusses*.\n\n> There's also a legality issue because OP does not actually have custody of this child, and so what would happen liability wise if the child is injured.\n\nAgain, do you have any reason to think that the OP was taking this child anywhere other than *lecture classes*? Exactly what makes you think that this boy was going to be injured in a lecture? \n\n>  Plus, as a final note, one day is fine, but it is unfair and unreasonable to expect a class to deal with a child for a full week.\n\nI disagree. \n\n>  That is not the professor's call.\n\nAnd I disagree on this as well.", "Which is\u2026*checks notes* NOT the situation in the post.
