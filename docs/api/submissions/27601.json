I guarantee that your nephew will remember this time that you took care of him and it will be among his fondest memories.\n\nHe sounds like a good kid.", "NTA and kudos to your nephew for sitting quietly and self entertaining himself. Sounds better behaved than some of your fellow students.\n\nHeck, when I went to college, there were parents who brought babies to class on occasion. Nobody had a problem with it", "Was it for a whole week? 5 days?  Bringing him to class?\n\nOne day is an emergency, 2 days is sorting things out.  Any longer is taking advantage.\n\nWhat people are likely pissed off about is some of these people likely have kids too and they likely have them in paid daycare or some other arrangement.\n\nIf it's an emergency his parents can pay for paid daycare while you go to class.\n\nIt's nice he was well behaved and you got permission but it effects others and you be \"allowed\" while others can't will anoy your class mates.\n\nDef not an AH but I can understand why people are annoyed.", "NTA you have asked for permission, and he will only be there temporarily, and you have done everything possible to make it easier for those around you. Some people just feel the need to complain. Your doing a great job in an emergency situation.", "NTA\n\nYou got permission from the people who had authority to give it. Your classmates shouldn't be any more distracted by a quiet kid than another quiet classmate.", "NTA\nIt was a temporary, emergency situation, that you recieved permission for. You even had the thought to bring quiet activities to keep him busy. The fact that the professors complimented you on him shows that he was well behaved. If they believed he was a large distraction, they most likely would have pulled you aside after class and told you so.", "I know I\u2019ll get downvotes for it, but NAH, bordering on you suck for the school thing. The work situation is obviously fine, there\u2019s kids everywhere, and the situation was an emergency. However, college is difficult and expensive. It\u2019s really not about how the professors feel, it\u2019s about how the other students feel. They are paying a not insignificant amount of money and putting in a lot of time and hard work, they deserve to receive the education they signed up for. A child in the classroom is a distraction, it colors the topics of conversation that can be broached, and legos are arguably quiet or not, depending on the child. Given it was temporary, I probably would let it go, but in future everyone should have more appropriate backup plans for these situations. \n\nThe classroom that is meant to serve all students shouldn\u2019t be a backup plan except in the most dire of situations and I think a day would be more understandable than an entire week. I know that will upset people but that\u2019s just my take. I understand your situation was tough and I get it, but most college students are struggling and they deserve to at least have the classroom be a space reserved for studying, discussion, and class. I\u2019m glad your nephew was well behaved but the precedent you\u2019ve set opens the door for more disruptions and I can understand the frustration for people paying a lot of money to learn.", "Some people just have to complain.  it sounds like you did everything correctly.  you informed the professors, and had plenty of things to keep the little one quietly entertained. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m going with NAH. It can be distracting in class to have a little one playing and making noises. But given it was an emergency, I would cut you some slack!", "NTA -- if your professors are okay with it, the matter is closed. You chose a great strategy given the stress of a family emergency.", "NTA. Some of the students are probably less well behaved than it sounds your nephew is.", "NTA\n\nHave they never seen a child before ? If it takes this little for them to forget the teacher, they should learn to focus on lessons.\n\nYour nephew was quiet and didn't bother anyone. Sounds like the problem wasn't on your side. It's theirs.", "NTA. If your professors approved this and complimented his behavior afterward, he couldn't have been really that \"distracting.\"\n\nIt was an emergency, and you got the green light from the relevant authorities for each class. Your classmates can suck it. Plus, it's not going to happen again, as far as you know, so it's a non-issue.", "It was an emergency and your teachers were fine with it. Your nephew was quiet and well behaved. NTA. Sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.", "NTA. As long as you\u2019re being honest with how his behavior was. If he was staying relatively  quiet and in one place I don\u2019t see the issue. I\u2019ve been in a couple classes during college where a mother would have her child, and there was no issue. As long as the child is well behaved there shouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "NTA You had permission and he didn't disrupt anyone.", "NTA.  You got permission from everyone you needed to and it sounds like he behaved extremely well.", "NTA\n\nYou checked with your professors and made sure he had something to keep him occupied during class. You handled this perfectly.", "NTA\n\nIt was an emergency, and you asked all the ones who mattered if it was ok.  Some people need to remove their noses from other's business.", "NTA - it's an emergency, not a daily thing. not to mention, your professors agreed so they're opinion, and feelings, are moot.", "NTA, emergencies happen, and you had to roll with it. You cleared it with everyone actually in charge who had a day in such things. \n\nIgnore everyone else", "NTA, next time ask them for the babysitting money. You asked the teachers for permission for him to be here and they said yes. That\u2019s all that matters", "NTA\n\nI know a lot of places that wouldn\u2019t accept that but you asked, professors/boss said yes, and he was well behaved. That\u2019s all that matters.", "YTA.\n\nIt's good that you checked in with your professors first, but if I was a student in that same class, I would not want a 5 year old there.", "NTA. \n\nI was dragged to and from many college courses when my parental figure was trying to get their masters degree. As long as the kid is quiet and behaved, which you have pretty much stated that they are, then there should be no issue.\n\nYour classmates need to get a grip. Kids are going to be places.", "A child in the back of the class not making noise is only distracting if you want them to be. In your case, your nephew was quiet and well-behaved. He's only distracting for people who are looking at him, and given that he's sitting behind them, they have to actively choose to turn around and watch the kid rather than the lecture.\n\nIn general, it's not a good idea (one little kid might be able to be quiet during a lecture. Two little kids probably end up interacting with each other, and that rarely stays quiet), but as a concession to an emergency situation, I think it's fine. And as you noted, you asked permission from all your professors, and permission was granted.\n\nSo I'm going with NTA.", "NTA. Maybe they are just upset that it's not a \"normal\" thing they feel they can do (if they have kids).", "NTA. \n\nThe professors had no problem with it. He was quiet in the back of the classroom. I am trying to figure out, why they are upset in the first place. Are the jealous they have to get day care?", "He's not causing a disturbance and you git permission NTA", "If the profs don't mind and he's not disruptive, you're fine. NTA", "NTA - emergencies happen. You asked for permission beforehand and he didn\u2019t act out. They\u2019re reaching", "NTA. It was an emergency, and it sounds like he was perfectly well-behaved. Short of taking the whole day off, I don't see any other way you *could* have handled it.", "NTA not everyone can confirm to a schedule all the time and taking your nephew to class is not a big deal.  My mum took us to her university classes all the time and there was 0 issue.  Some people just like to complain.", "NTA \n\nThey\u2019re just mad because they can\u2019t play with his Lego set in class.", "NTA but check your college policies in case some students do complain. Professors often don't know policies, but some campuses do have rules re children on campus (largely to do with safeguarding, insurance risks etc.).", "NTA. Things happen and you made the best of a situation. Your professors weren't bothered by it, I wouldn't let anybody else make a stink.", "NTA. You went about it extremely respectfully. You didn't just randomly show up to class with a rambunctious kid who was loud and disruptive. You contacted everyone in advance to get permission, you thoughtfully planned it out and brought an activity he could enjoy quietly and independently. It's a family emergency and it's only for a week.\n\nYeah, a babysitter would have been ideal. But that wasn't an option so you came up with a working alternative and *got approval* that it was okay.\n\nThey're just complaining after the fact? Ignore them! They don't deserve more than a shrug in response.", "NTA.  You were making the best out of an emergency situation and it was just for a week.\n\nPlus your professors didn't have a problem with it and clearly your work didn't either.\n\nThis sub once again proves that no good deed goes unpunished.", "YTA. College is not a daycare. Work is not daycare. Other students are trying to learn. People who are around children often forget that \u2018quiet\u2019 to them is not quiet to others.", "NTA\n\nYou checked with the professors and they'd ok'd it.  It's not a regular thing; it was an emergency.  The other students don't live your life and need to butt out.  \n\nIf the kid was disruptive, that would've been a different story.", "NTA\n\nWhere were you supposed to find the money for a babysitter?  You did the best you could in a tough situation.", "NTA - lots of people go to school\nEven some w/o childcare.\n\nSchool isn\u2019t just for the privileged few who can manage to button life up for it - it\u2019s for everyone. If the professors are good, you good.", "If he was genuinely not making noise or being a distraction, NTA. Some people just like to complain.", "NTA many parents have had to take their kid to class with them in an emergency.\nYou had permission, it was a one time thing and your nephew behaved appropriately.\nHim being there did not negatively impact your classmates in any way.\n\nI had to take my daughter to a law class once. She loved it and my instructor was great.", "NTA. When I was in Highschool, sometimes my teachers would bring in their kids/grandkids when they couldn't find a sitter. They were usually very well behaved. \n\nOne teacher even bought his new puppy to school so he could take better care of him the first couple of weeks.", "NTA. It was one time in an emergency, your professors said it was okay, you provided him with ways to occupy himself, and he behaved himself. The other students should mind their own business.", "I'm assuming there weren't any exams going on? And this wasn't in any sort of laboratory or anything?\n\nNTA.\n\nYou took the time to make sure it was cleared with the professors and you kept him quiet/out of the way.  Ideally, yes, he'd be with a babysitter/parent/daycare while you were in class, but this isn't an ideal world - you made the best of it.", "I went to college with a single mum who had to bring her kid every now and then. The kid always behaved and we barely noticed her\n\nAs long as the kid is quiet it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. My guess is some of your class mates aren\u2019t doing as good as they wish in college and try to find way to excuse it. Or maybe they\u2019re just grumpy haha \n\nIt\u2019s actually a law in my country that all universities and colleges have to accommodate to kids when they can\u2019t go to childcare", "NTA - I went to a few of my moms uni classes with her when I was that age and it eas cool. \n\nShe was in music, drama and dance so it was especially cool to me as a kid.", "My aunt had to fill in for my single mom a couple of times and I can remember going to college class with her. The kid will def remember it as a positive! Def. NTA", "NTA some people just hate kids.", "Lmao Fuck them\nNTA", "NTA - OP I don't even LIKE kids and I am sympathetic to your situation and commend you on doing a great job keeping a small human safe and sound for a whole week while still working and going to school. Very impressive!\n\nI get how some of your classmates might be jealous, etc. but they don't know the whole story. They should mind their own business.", "NOPE", "NTA, if he wasn't acting out, then I don't see a problem, especially if the professors didn't take issue with it.", "NTA.  Professors rule the roost.  If students have a problem, they should take it up with the professor.  \n\nYou should also be ready for the professor to not let that become a normal thing.  Cause it shouldn't be allowed long term imo.", "NTA. I\u2019ve brought my nephew to class before for similar reasons. It\u2019s awesome your work and professors were reasonable. \n\n This is just a taste of the hypocrisy parents have to deal with: have kids!\u2026but not like that and deff not where I can see it and don\u2019t ask for any help but do it my way even tho I know nothing of the individuals or the situation", "NTA. Who are these weirdos claiming to be distracted by a kid with an iPad and headphones.\n\nI\u2019ve taken my niece literally everywhere like that if I had to babysit last minute (school, work, even fancy restaurants) and the only comments I ever received were from startled classmates/coworkers/waiters saying \u201cI cringed when I saw that child but I COULD NOT believe how quietly they sat and entertained themselves on their own!
