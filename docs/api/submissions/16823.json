My fianc\u00e9 did not grow up with this stepsister as their parents married after they were both out of the house, and they are not close. His stepsister\u2019s oldest is on the spectrum; he is mostly non-verbal and communicates physically and through grunts and very few words. He is very physically active, stimulating himself by running around his environment (home, restaurant, etc.) and making loud noises. His younger sister wants to play with him, so she follows his lead and runs around making loud noises. Significantly, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister does nothing to try to reign them in or help them behave more appropriately. She makes sure they don\u2019t wander too far, but they are otherwise free to do what they want. This occurs even in crowded restaurants, with the children regularly getting up from the table to walk around the room. The third child is an infant. \n\nNeither I nor my fianc\u00e9 have anything against kids in general. We both want kids in the future, and there will be a few other toddlers and young children at the wedding, all of whom we know personally and are much better behaved in public settings. \n\nOur wedding ceremony will be outdoors, but the reception will be mostly inside, with some limited outdoor space. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister\u2019s children will have room outside to run around, but will likely still disturb the guests, and will not have the space to run around inside the reception area. I am also worried that the two of them playing and being rambunctious will encourage the other children to be join in and cause distraction and potential chaos to both the ceremony and reception. \n\nWIBTA if I requested that she find other arrangements for her children for the night and risk her declining the invitation to attend the wedding at all? \n\nTLDR: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister has very loud and active children, whom she allows to run free in their environments. I am worried about the impact that this will have on my wedding and the other children at the wedding, and I do not trust that she would be able to control her children at the event.\n\nEdit: Some people have (reasonably) pointed out that I would be discriminating against the child with autism. While not my intention, I fully understand how that is the conclusion of my actions. My perspective was more on the mother\u2019s ability to provide an alternate form of care instead of allowing her children to \u201crun wild,\u201d but I understand that I do not have a very full understanding of the nuances of his autism and that I may be asking something that is not possible at this point in his development.

I\u2019m engaged and we are having autistic kids at the wedding because they are used to this kind of stimulation and their parents are the sort to take them out if they are distressed/disruptive.\n\nYou aren\u2019t being mean (I am not bigoted against those with vertigo but I wouldn\u2019t invite them to go bungee jumping!) it\u2019s about the behaviour.

I think you have to be honest that other kids are going to be invited.\n\nBut as long as the issue isn't that he is non-verbal and makes random sounds (cuz kids make noise) but is that in inappropriate locations, he and sister will run around. I think that's okay. Mom has to know that behavior isn't okay everyplace and it's going to mean that there are places where she needs a plan.\n\nNow maybe the answer is for your fiance to speak with her parents (or parents and stepsister) and acknowledge the issue. Go- I'd love niece and nephew to come but I know that when nephew feels like X, Y, or Z, he likes to run around and that won't be an option during the reception. So can we come up with a plan for nephew or is the best option for them to not come?

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re discriminating against the kids but more so the fact that the stepsister is not a good parent. I have an autistic sister so I don\u2019t say this with any malice in my heart. I just don\u2019t think the environment is suitable for the child or you for your wedding. I would hate to spend all that money to have someone with bad parenting to let their kid mess up the day. This is not just a family cookout, this is your wedding. So I get it. I think you should have a conversation with her. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to cause some problems. But oh well. I wouldn\u2019t spend thousands of dollars to have someone mess it up.

For instance, my not wanting a blind person to drive my car doesn't mean I'm discriminating against his disability, it's just that it plain isn't safe for him or anyone else. Where this child can't still, it isn't safe for him or his sister to be running wild around an enclosed reception with possible hot food, expensive decor(possibly glass) and drunken adults.

OP seems to recognize that SIL doesn't care about her kid disrupting stuff and is taking steps to enforce a standard of behavior herself.", "So a nice, easy way to alleviate any 'discrimation' is to say that children are welcome, BUT they must meet your expectations of behavior. If they do not believe they're children can meet that expectation then they should not bring their children. Then, define what you think acceptable behavior is. I would define was is acceptable, but do not list what is unacceptable as that will trigger SIL.

I still struggle with being wet unless its completely being in water, i.e. rain is a no go, but swimming is fine. I do have to dry off pretty quickly after getting out or itll start bothering me.
