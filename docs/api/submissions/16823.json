My fianc\u00e9 did not grow up with this stepsister as their parents married after they were both out of the house, and they are not close. His stepsister\u2019s oldest is on the spectrum; he is mostly non-verbal and communicates physically and through grunts and very few words. He is very physically active, stimulating himself by running around his environment (home, restaurant, etc.) and making loud noises. His younger sister wants to play with him, so she follows his lead and runs around making loud noises. Significantly, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister does nothing to try to reign them in or help them behave more appropriately. She makes sure they don\u2019t wander too far, but they are otherwise free to do what they want. This occurs even in crowded restaurants, with the children regularly getting up from the table to walk around the room. The third child is an infant. \n\nNeither I nor my fianc\u00e9 have anything against kids in general. We both want kids in the future, and there will be a few other toddlers and young children at the wedding, all of whom we know personally and are much better behaved in public settings. \n\nOur wedding ceremony will be outdoors, but the reception will be mostly inside, with some limited outdoor space. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister\u2019s children will have room outside to run around, but will likely still disturb the guests, and will not have the space to run around inside the reception area. I am also worried that the two of them playing and being rambunctious will encourage the other children to be join in and cause distraction and potential chaos to both the ceremony and reception. \n\nWIBTA if I requested that she find other arrangements for her children for the night and risk her declining the invitation to attend the wedding at all? \n\nTLDR: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister has very loud and active children, whom she allows to run free in their environments. I am worried about the impact that this will have on my wedding and the other children at the wedding, and I do not trust that she would be able to control her children at the event.\n\nEdit: Some people have (reasonably) pointed out that I would be discriminating against the child with autism. While not my intention, I fully understand how that is the conclusion of my actions. My perspective was more on the mother\u2019s ability to provide an alternate form of care instead of allowing her children to \u201crun wild,\u201d but I understand that I do not have a very full understanding of the nuances of his autism and that I may be asking something that is not possible at this point in his development.

If they do not believe they're children can meet that expectation then they should not bring their children. Then, define what you think acceptable behavior is. I would define was is acceptable, but do not list what is unacceptable as that will trigger SIL.

I still struggle with being wet unless its completely being in water, i.e. rain is a no go, but swimming is fine. I do have to dry off pretty quickly after getting out or itll start bothering me.

How will his parents feel about their grandchildren being excluded?

Being autistic doesn't make him some special petting zoo case that can't grow up, it just means that his parents have to get creative and meet him on his level, and a lot of people are too lazy to do that.", "OP's wedding is not a public event.

Forcing him to attend an event where a minimum of behavior and quietness is expected would be an unpleasant experience for both parties.", "Stimming is one thing, but if the child's need is to rampage around yelling loudly and getting underfoot, risking tripping people or causing accidents, then the parents need to accept the fact that the child likely won't be welcomed at events where they will be a certain disruption (wedding ceremony) or possible danger to others (reception). And what possible justification do you offer for letting the daughter do it as well? That is nothing but bad parenting from start to finish.", "But the kid running around is disruptiv", "I agree this was poorly worded however I think the underlying point that most people here seem to agree on is that while no one should be discriminated against that does not make anyone above another in the sense that if someones behavior is disruptive...its disruptive simple as that. If I got up and started running around a movie theater I would be asked to leave. It is the responsibility of a parent to understand their child enough to advocate for them, set and understand social boundaries and to understand what their child is capable and/or not capable of. That is the case for ALL PARENTS. It is not discrimination to understand that the entire world cannot adapt to one person and allow them to disrupt the social space.\n\nEdit: I would like to clarify my stance. As a parent (which I am one) you should not bring your child into situation you and they are not prepared to handle. You also should not let any child run wild in your care outside of a play space or your home or other space acceptable for that. THAT part is the bad PARENTING. I have a young child and I am always prepared to leave a situation I have brought them into if it is not suited for them or others involved. I'm not going to let them run around a restaurant or scream in a theater out of RESPECT for others and I am also not going to force the people around me to just deal with it on the basis of them being young. That's the point here. If your child needs A LOT of stimuli that doesn\u2019t mean everyone wherever you go needs to accommodate that.", "I was looking for someone who understands this in the comments.

At every one of our family events my aunt, a damn saint by the way, is always chasing him around making sure he had his fidget toys and keeping him safe as he would regularly attempt to hit himself. We never dreamt of excluding either of them from any of our events. They\u2019re just part of our family and that\u2019s that. He is 19 now and it\u2019s still the same, nothing my aunt could have done would cause him to \u201cact appropriately\u201d.

They will get the stink-eye in any public place, they will have to fight for the right to be in schools, in movie theatres, in swimming pools, daycares, camps, etc., etc. They are already facing ableism and contempt every day.   \n\n\nYou could ask them to step aside because they're not normal enough, or you could ask yourself \"What can I do to make my wedding a joyful time for the people I care about?\" What about arranging a space for any child who has a little energy? What do you think your sister-in-law would ask for, if she knew her kids would be welcomed and accommodated? All it would take is to connect with her and let her know \"I want all of you to be safe and have fun at the ceremony and reception. I know it's not easy sitting for a long time, and there may not be room to run in the dining area, especially with waiters carrying food around. What has worked for you in the past and is there anything I can help with?\"  \n\n\nYour thoughtfulness will be profoundly appreciated by this family, as well as any other families whose kids are having an \"off\" night. Special-needs parenting is a brutal gig, but no parent wants to worry all night about whether their kids are being \"well-behaved\" either. Enjoy your wedding, have fun, and I hope this is the beginning of a meaningful alliance with the whole family.", "NTA. No Spectrum related spiel or association. Your wedding your choices. Cheers bud!", "Why dont you pay for a babysitter as a nice surprise?\n\nIf allowing the other children to attend and the possibility of these children being disruptive is a genuine concern than the few hundred you'd be out in a good sitter to watch them for the duration of the wedding should be a cost well worth it. \n\nSpin that you thought she might love a night childfree, that you understand new situations with large amounts of strangers can be extremely over stimulating for a child with special needs (apologies if thats no longer the appropriate terminology), and a special thing you're doing for her just as a sister.", "It\u2019s fairly common to have a child free wedding, with the exception of flower girls / ring bearers- would it be possible to give the other children you want to attend  these roles, and then you can easily say to the step sister it\u2019s a child free wedding with only those kids in the wedding party coming.", "NTA \n\nEither child-free all the way or hire a couple babysitters and a room for the kids to be away from the celebration.  They should, however, be served their own meals & cake in that environment. \n\nOr, since he doesn't really have a relationship with her, just don't invite her. \n\nThe stepsister sounds like an ineffective parent if her kids are allowed to bother other diners without consequences.", "NTA, But why are you inviting the stepsister if she and your fiance aren't even close? I would never invite someone I'm not close to or don't even like, relation or not. Sure, maybe you'd make others upset, but it's your wedding.\n\nSkip the invitation altogether, to save yourself that additional headache, and money for that extra mouth to feed.", "As an autistic parent of an autistic child, you would do the child a favour by not having them at a wedding. No shade to weddings in general, but we don't always do well with those situations, people don't always explain in ways that make sense to us why we should sit during the vows and speeches and toasts. It's tedious to the child, exhausting for the parent (if they engage), and a disturbance for most others. \nThat said, toddler brains work the same. So I'd say make it all child-free. \n\nAs the parent of an autistic child, I will also point out that it's possible that one or both parents will not attend. Many young autistics don't do well with new caregivers, and parents are for sure rubbed raw by the discrimination they see their kids experience. So expect that. \n\nNTA about not wanting disruption, would be if it's about not wanting the 'odd' child.", "Be straight with her and explain that the indoor space is close quarters, so her kids will have to stay seated and not wander about.  If she seems reluctant about controlling them, offer to bring a cake and some balloons for the kids later at home.  That way you can show the photos and videos to her, and the kids will feel just  fine about it.  The Mom will feel like you're doing her a favor by not asking her to dress up the kids and drag them out to a party of all adults (boring), where instead they can stay home and still get cake.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with ableism or discrimination, unless you count discriminating against bad parents. You are simply not inviting known, expected chaos to your WEDDING. Just address the invitation to the adults. If they ask, tell them you have noticed how they allow their children to behave publicly, and you refuse to worry about that on your wedding day", "YWNBTA, but I don\u2019t think it will go well. \n\nI have kids on the spectrum, but I don\u2019t let any of my kids run around in restaurants and disturb other people. The Autism just meant that it was a lot more work for me and took longer for them to learn how to behave appropriately, not that they didn\u2019t need to behave. \n\nI\u2019ve had 3 close family members have child free weddings. It was always to exclude some specific kids whose parents will not stop them from mucking up, not because of my kids. But I do understand why they had to diplomatically exclude all children to keep those ones out. \n\n\nWe had to miss one of the weddings because we had a baby who was too young to be without me at the time, but we both got to go to one and I got to go to the other alone, with my husband staying home with our kids. \n\nIt had the added benefit of us actually getting to enjoy ourselves at the weddings we got to go to because we weren\u2019t constantly parenting our kids.", "We have kids in the family who behave questionably, and when my brother got married, they requested no children. I had a toddler but understood completely. Our dad even hired a babysitter so several of the kids could stay at his house. It would be best to make it an all or nothing regarding the kids and just ignore the complaints, 'cause no matter what someone will be pissed.", "I had somewhat of the opposite at my wedding. We said no children but made an exception for one little cousin who we are particularly close to. We lost an entire side of the family for this choice who felt we were unfair to their children - and perhaps we were. They literally have never spoken to us since and some have since died. I would advise you to do all or nothing-and learn from my mistake.", "NTA just don\u2019t invite her", "I would deliver the invitation face to face with stepsister and her husband and express my concerns. We have had several in our family with autism and it needs to be a group effort on how to handle the situation. Maybe uncle or cousin or whoever they can trust can be a helper. Give them an usher designation and make a plan to include the kids while still keeping the peace for the ceremony. Maybe after they hear your concerns stepsister and husband decide to get a sitter or they stay home altogether. If that's what they need to do, maybe they'd be more comfortable doing that. Communicate with them and see what the best option is.\n I really don't like how a lot of people are saying this is at all ableist to ask this question. These kids likely will not remember anything about your big day anyway. This should be a very valid question, but it should be something the parents should be talking about themselves. Some parents are not well equipped to be the parents of autistic kids. It took me a few years to get the hang of it, and during that time, we didn't even go to restaurants or really any kind of event because it was too difficult and honestly counter productive to my son's well being. He is now fully verbal and a (mostly) rational teenager. Now they say he has ADHD. It took a ton of counseling, therapy, and one on one work, but the effort has to be there from family. \nI will mention, if you come at the situation wrong to stepsister, I could see her getting upset. It can't be \"you know he will ruin my big day!\" It really needs to be more about the logistics of the whole thing. \"I know Blank has a difficult time during these types of situations, and I'd like to talk about how this might go.\" If you're able, maybe you could find something he might enjoy for him to do. My son loved cars. If you needed to deliver bad news, everything was okay if he got a new hot wheels car. \nMy problem is this, there are more and more kids falling on the autism spectrum now than ever before. As the doctor told me why my son was autistic, I couldn't help but think back to my early years and stories my family told me about myself. I rarely said a word, struggled in school, had anxiety, bad hygiene, refused to look people in the eyes, disliked touching or being touched and the list goes on and on. I knew how my childhood worked and decided if I had any chance of helping my son, I could draw on what worked for me growing up. It's been a long run that is far from over, but I'm glad to see my son's progress. \nHere's the funny thing, if you look at the number of autistic people in the US, there will be 2 significantly different numbers. One is how many doctors \"estimate\" to have autism. The other is how many autistic people there are as recognized by the state. In order to be declared autistic by the state, they require ample evidence and the convincing of a doctor that will be as skeptical as possible (I guess it depends on your state for that one). \nIf we start letting people be labeled by something so vague, everyone will have it in no time. And everyone will be offended by everything. I met a kid(18) that was legally considered autistic by the state, but to me, he just felt antisocial during 90% of the time I was around him. The other 10% he was engaging and smiling. He came from a family that... ...made questionable decisions to say the least.  My point is, they're family. Communicate and try to find the best solution. Autism shouldn't be scary, we should embrace it and try to find the best in it. Autistic kids have fun in weird ways sometimes, but it'd be a real top tier move if you could find a solution where everyone wins.", "NTA.  How about calling her, and telling her that you cannot accommodate her 2 older kids at the wedding itself, nor indoors. But if she brings a sitter, whose job is *specifically* to keep the kids from bugging other guests, she can bring the children. The sitter can keep them outside during the ceremony, and monitor them closely while they eat.  And you will feed the sitter the wedding meal, of course, as they will also be a guest.", "THIS! My friends kids are not well behaved and I wouldn\u2019t want to invite them to some places. Like I didn\u2019t invite them earlier this year to something because honestly they would have been too rowdy. It\u2019s not about their abilities it\u2019s about my friends willingness to parent them for some situations. Sorry not sorry.", ">I may be the outlier but I think it's okay to tell someone that you don't think your event is the right fit for their child. I think you have to be honest that other kids are going to be invited.\n\nI plus 1'ed u/rak1882 for their suggestion. But is the event large enough that they could occupy one of the side areas or rear where their noise making wouldn't be too much of a disruption?", "I see your point but I don't think OP should have to make it child free. Sounds like they want kids at their wedding. Maybe OP and stepsister can look at hiring some childcare. Sounds like the stepsister needs it anyway - it could be a really productive conversation if handled with delicacy and over time.", "This. OP, please understand that your fianc\u00e9's stepsister will feel discriminated if you specifically told her her kids aren't welcome. As unfair as it will be to the other kids on the guest list, this is about making it fair to have a ceremony/reception that will be the least disruptive.", "I wanted my autistic uncle, who was in his late 30s and on medication to keep him calm (I knew nothing about his treatment, so I didn't know if this was legitimate treatment.  It was a long time ago), to come to my wedding.  My mother, who absolutely adored her brother and took him everywhere, told me it wasn't a good idea for him to come.  Even with his treatment, he would still be loud and disruptive, and my mother would spend the entire time taking care of him.   I understood my mother's reasoning, so we didn't bring him to my wedding.  \n\nOP, I understand your reasoning for not wanting the children there also, so YWNBTA.  I don't know if the stepsister will understand though.", "Unfortunately sometimes the childfree decision gets made because one set of parents are too permissive. It sucks for everyone else who does control their kids, but it unfortunately is what it is. If you exclude someone\u2019s kids and they see that at the wedding, a shit fit will be thrown at some point.", "Yeah, her edit sort of boiled my blood because she would be excluding him but for good reason. I'm autistic as well, and was a crier as a kid for many reasons, so my parents would go to an event to say hi and talk with the people for a bit with us kids and then leave because I'd get overstimulated and would scream at the top of my lungs. \n\nThis mom, the stepsister, however is neglectful to the environments. This is a parenting issue. Say the kid is running around the webbing reception and trips a guest? Say the kids themselves faceplant into the ground? All (however many) kids are running around too? OP would not be the AH for excluding her kids for the lack if social awareness, but should probably make it child free or older kids (like teenagers) only. \n\nYWNBTA, OP. This isn't an exclusion issue, that kid can't help that he's autistic but his mom isn't doing him any favors by not correcting him. If she actively tried to correct him, it would be ESH, but she doesn't and lets her kid not only create a hazard but a scene.", "I mean that would hardly be any better than specifically singling out the kids\u2026 the SIL would still question why she wasn\u2019t invited\u2026", "As an adult with step-siblings I am not super close with, as our respective parents got married when we were in college, I still argue that they are closely related enough to be a \u201cdefinite invite.\u201d In other words, if one of my step brothers hypothetically did not invite me to his wedding I would be extremely insulted and vice versa, even though we don\u2019t necessarily have the type of relationship that siblings or younger step-siblings have.", "I agree. I hate the lack of empathy for those that aren\u2019t \u2018normal.\u2019 I don\u2019t have a personal experience with autistic kids but I find it so sad that everyone has to be perfect.", "Your kid might be sweet, but if he is running around stimming like a freaking airplane melting down, I woukd not want him there", "I think a lot of childfree weddings are specifically because of ONE KID who would HAVE to be invited, would act up, and the parents won't do anything about and the b&g know it.

We *are* very isolated, and I very much miss fully participating in big family activities and just normal social things.  As my son has grown older he *has* done better with things, he likes to eat in restaurants, little things like that, but that can always change quickly.

Some people have friends who are able to pay for childcare, or have friends and family who can provide it for free.
