My fianc\u00e9 did not grow up with this stepsister as their parents married after they were both out of the house, and they are not close. His stepsister\u2019s oldest is on the spectrum; he is mostly non-verbal and communicates physically and through grunts and very few words. He is very physically active, stimulating himself by running around his environment (home, restaurant, etc.) and making loud noises. His younger sister wants to play with him, so she follows his lead and runs around making loud noises. Significantly, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister does nothing to try to reign them in or help them behave more appropriately. She makes sure they don\u2019t wander too far, but they are otherwise free to do what they want. This occurs even in crowded restaurants, with the children regularly getting up from the table to walk around the room. The third child is an infant. \n\nNeither I nor my fianc\u00e9 have anything against kids in general. We both want kids in the future, and there will be a few other toddlers and young children at the wedding, all of whom we know personally and are much better behaved in public settings. \n\nOur wedding ceremony will be outdoors, but the reception will be mostly inside, with some limited outdoor space. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister\u2019s children will have room outside to run around, but will likely still disturb the guests, and will not have the space to run around inside the reception area. I am also worried that the two of them playing and being rambunctious will encourage the other children to be join in and cause distraction and potential chaos to both the ceremony and reception. \n\nWIBTA if I requested that she find other arrangements for her children for the night and risk her declining the invitation to attend the wedding at all? \n\nTLDR: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister has very loud and active children, whom she allows to run free in their environments. I am worried about the impact that this will have on my wedding and the other children at the wedding, and I do not trust that she would be able to control her children at the event.\n\nEdit: Some people have (reasonably) pointed out that I would be discriminating against the child with autism. While not my intention, I fully understand how that is the conclusion of my actions. My perspective was more on the mother\u2019s ability to provide an alternate form of care instead of allowing her children to \u201crun wild,\u201d but I understand that I do not have a very full understanding of the nuances of his autism and that I may be asking something that is not possible at this point in his development.

I think that's okay. Mom has to know that behavior isn't okay everyplace and it's going to mean that there are places where she needs a plan.\n\nNow maybe the answer is for your fiance to speak with her parents (or parents and stepsister) and acknowledge the issue. Go- I'd love niece and nephew to come but I know that when nephew feels like X, Y, or Z, he likes to run around and that won't be an option during the reception. So can we come up with a plan for nephew or is the best option for them to not come?

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re discriminating against the kids but more so the fact that the stepsister is not a good parent. I have an autistic sister so I don\u2019t say this with any malice in my heart. I just don\u2019t think the environment is suitable for the child or you for your wedding.

If they do not believe they're children can meet that expectation then they should not bring their children. Then, define what you think acceptable behavior is. I would define was is acceptable, but do not list what is unacceptable as that will trigger SIL.

I still struggle with being wet unless its completely being in water, i.e. rain is a no go, but swimming is fine. I do have to dry off pretty quickly after getting out or itll start bothering me.

How will his parents feel about their grandchildren being excluded?

Being autistic doesn't make him some special petting zoo case that can't grow up, it just means that his parents have to get creative and meet him on his level, and a lot of people are too lazy to do that.", "OP's wedding is not a public event. The kids wouldn't even know/care if he's not invited. Forcing him to attend an event where a minimum of behavior and quietness is expected would be an unpleasant experience for both parties.", "Stimming is one thing, but if the child's need is to rampage around yelling loudly and getting underfoot, risking tripping people or causing accidents, then the parents need to accept the fact that the child likely won't be welcomed at events where they will be a certain disruption (wedding ceremony) or possible danger to others (reception). And what possible justification do you offer for letting the daughter do it as well? That is nothing but bad parenting from start to finish.", "But the kid running around is disruptiv", "I agree this was poorly worded however I think the underlying point that most people here seem to agree on is that while no one should be discriminated against that does not make anyone above another in the sense that if someones behavior is disruptive...its disruptive simple as that. If I got up and started running around a movie theater I would be asked to leave. It is the responsibility of a parent to understand their child enough to advocate for them, set and understand social boundaries and to understand what their child is capable and/or not capable of. That is the case for ALL PARENTS. It is not discrimination to understand that the entire world cannot adapt to one person and allow them to disrupt the social space.", "I was looking for someone who understands this in the comments. My cousin is on the spectrum and is unable to speak as well. He uses noises and gestures to communicate. At every one of our family events my aunt, a damn saint by the way, is always chasing him around making sure he had his fidget toys and keeping him safe as he would regularly attempt to hit himself. We never dreamt of excluding either of them from any of our events. They\u2019re just part of our family and that\u2019s that. He is 19 now and it\u2019s still the same, nothing my aunt could have done would cause him to \u201cact appropriately\u201d. She will have to be his full time caretaker forever and when she passes he will need a full time nursing home to help him with activities of daily living and such. So personally I feel OP should make the event child free or accept the family as it is. She doesn\u2019t know the stress that comes with raising a child with autism and how it may feel to be excluded bc of something out of your control. It\u2019s also pertinent to mention many parents in this position cannot just find childcare. Their child is rarely able to be comfortable around strangers or anyone who isn\u2019t their primary caretaker.", "Yeah I realize it CAN affect your behavior, oh smart mouthed one. But it doesn\u2019t have to. Had the SIL raised him differently then his behavior would not be atrocious. Lots of things CAN affect one\u2019s behavior. Doesn\u2019t mean it will. The fact that you can\u2019t see that\u2026\ud83d\ude44", "Yeah we thankfully didn\u2019t have that happen, but we were fully prepared to have those convos if we needed to!", "If you're talking careless\\_league\\_9494, he said :Did you actually just try to compare being born with a different neurotype that is 100% beyond your control, to choosing to be vegan? Are fucking serious right now? \ud83e\udd23The amount of ignorance, and ableism in your comment is fucking staggering bud. You seriously need to educate yourself, because your commentary has served only to prove that you literally don't even know enough about this subject to participate in this conversation, let alone be taken seriously in it. \ud83e\udd23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're NOT talking about him or didn't care at all, my apologies.  My autism is reading things that aren't there \ud83d\ude09  For the record, I think you're 100% correct.  I don't have kids, but if I know that an event will not be friendly towards me, I don't go.  I similarly think it is incredibly unfair to everyone including the kids in a situation when a parent doesn't do their best to ensure they can behave in a way that is appropriate (either sitting quietly or having other means in place like tablets or headphones that others have mentioned) and takes them anyway.  In this situation, it could be dangerous.  Kid could get hurt running around like that in public.", "Did you actually just try to compare being born with a different neurotype that is 100% beyond your control, to *choosing* to be vegan?

I have an autistic child, he's 11,who tends to get over whelmed and stims more in social settings. Sometimes, its just flapping his hands once or twice sometimes its him being vocal and loudly for a second. Weddings are a big nope. I'm sorry, but he won't sit down that long, and I know he would just be over whelmed. People, especially family, still try to hug him or want to talk to him he doesn't like to be touched, and he can barely say hello on a good day. I do bring his backpack with his headphones, sunglasses, iPad, snacks, and a few choice toys, but sometimes he just gets over whelmed. It breaks my heart when he suddenly starts silently crying because he's at his limit of social interaction.  I do take him to family gatherings, but after an hour, we are basically on his time. Really, my other two kids aren't very big on social gatherings, so it works out for all of us.", "So punish all the other parents who are able to keep their children under control, to assuage the feelings of the stepsister who doesnt keep her kids under control and has repeatedly demonstrated this? Sounds really fair and compromising", "Lol", "This is a great idea in theory but it requires people to be self aware and thoughtful enough to follow through. If I was told this I\u2019d be like, wait are my kids the problem? I work hard on making sure we\u2019re not rude in public but you never know. I feel like the kind of parent entitled enough to ignore problematic behavior (esp in public - when most people act their best) isn\u2019t the kind who\u2019d take this to heart.", "Haha it\u2019s just as insane to me to think that they can\u2019t. I know we did when I was growing up (I\u2019m 30). It was boring as hell, but we survived \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Uhm...no? It's the parent's job to parent their own kid. If the mother doesn't even care and just let her kid running around screaming then what could OP possibly do to \"accommodate\" that?", "I agree with everything you wrote but disagree that it has anything to do with the (lack of) kindness and intention of the initial one.", "I agr\u00e9e with that completely. I just can't wrap my head around the idea that somehow this child is just poorly behaved and needs \"real\" parenting when he has autism.", "And...? Is the infant going to be upset they weren't invited? Wouldn't the infant be the easiest one for a babysitter to care for?", "How about I compare disabilities then? I'm physically disabled and wouldn't expect to be invited to go hiking or rock climbing. While that sucks for me and hurts my feelings, it isn't anyone's fault. Same idea here. Kids will have to learn that unfortunately, not everything is for them.", "Omg I\u2019m reading your comments and you\u2019re attacking the other commenter over the weirdest stuff. You\u2019re so obviously incorrect and I feel bad for your children that you\u2019re going to let run wild, resulting in no one liking them. Rip", "What is your solution then?", "My daughter is 13, and I pack the same things, but yea, after an hour, we are heading out. She gets overwhelmed, and it's not fair to keep her in a place where she will be uncomfortable. Plus, weddings aren't a fun place for kids anyway aside from cake.", "I genuinely hope you never have a disabled child because you would harm them", "Are you purposely being obtuse?", "She\u2019s not not inviting the children because \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know them well\u201d she\u2019s not inviting them because they\u2019re known to be destructive and their mother just allows it. They could potentially ruin her wedding. Nope nope. The correct analogy is would you invite all your friends and their SO\u2019s except the one couple where your friends husband is loud and obnoxious and will very likely do something to mess up the day and all she\u2019ll say is \u201cthat\u2019s just how he is, you just have to let him do it, it\u2019s kinda funny\u201d. No I wouldn\u2019t invite them.", "I think the assumption of bad parenting comes from the fact that OP states their younger child acts just like him and she is not on the spectrum. Parents do nothing to curb the neurotypical child\u2019s disruptive and inappropriate behavior so people are likely assuming they\u2019re allotting the same parenting disservice to their autistic child.", "I suppose with all that running around it\u2019ll be doing, you have a point.", "Hahaha."]}
