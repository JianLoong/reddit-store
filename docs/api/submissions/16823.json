My fianc\u00e9 did not grow up with this stepsister as their parents married after they were both out of the house, and they are not close. His stepsister\u2019s oldest is on the spectrum; he is mostly non-verbal and communicates physically and through grunts and very few words. He is very physically active, stimulating himself by running around his environment (home, restaurant, etc.) and making loud noises. His younger sister wants to play with him, so she follows his lead and runs around making loud noises. Significantly, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister does nothing to try to reign them in or help them behave more appropriately. She makes sure they don\u2019t wander too far, but they are otherwise free to do what they want. This occurs even in crowded restaurants, with the children regularly getting up from the table to walk around the room. The third child is an infant. \n\nNeither I nor my fianc\u00e9 have anything against kids in general. We both want kids in the future, and there will be a few other toddlers and young children at the wedding, all of whom we know personally and are much better behaved in public settings. \n\nOur wedding ceremony will be outdoors, but the reception will be mostly inside, with some limited outdoor space. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister\u2019s children will have room outside to run around, but will likely still disturb the guests, and will not have the space to run around inside the reception area. I am also worried that the two of them playing and being rambunctious will encourage the other children to be join in and cause distraction and potential chaos to both the ceremony and reception. \n\nWIBTA if I requested that she find other arrangements for her children for the night and risk her declining the invitation to attend the wedding at all? \n\nTLDR: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepsister has very loud and active children, whom she allows to run free in their environments. I am worried about the impact that this will have on my wedding and the other children at the wedding, and I do not trust that she would be able to control her children at the event.\n\nEdit: Some people have (reasonably) pointed out that I would be discriminating against the child with autism. While not my intention, I fully understand how that is the conclusion of my actions. My perspective was more on the mother\u2019s ability to provide an alternate form of care instead of allowing her children to \u201crun wild,\u201d but I understand that I do not have a very full understanding of the nuances of his autism and that I may be asking something that is not possible at this point in his development.

I think that's okay. Mom has to know that behavior isn't okay everyplace and it's going to mean that there are places where she needs a plan.\n\nNow maybe the answer is for your fiance to speak with her parents (or parents and stepsister) and acknowledge the issue. Go- I'd love niece and nephew to come but I know that when nephew feels like X, Y, or Z, he likes to run around and that won't be an option during the reception. So can we come up with a plan for nephew or is the best option for them to not come?

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re discriminating against the kids but more so the fact that the stepsister is not a good parent. I have an autistic sister so I don\u2019t say this with any malice in my heart. I just don\u2019t think the environment is suitable for the child or you for your wedding.

If they do not believe they're children can meet that expectation then they should not bring their children. Then, define what you think acceptable behavior is. I would define was is acceptable, but do not list what is unacceptable as that will trigger SIL.

I still struggle with being wet unless its completely being in water, i.e. rain is a no go, but swimming is fine. I do have to dry off pretty quickly after getting out or itll start bothering me.

Just choose something that's not ableist and discriminatory, that's a definite AH move.\n\nIf the child already has a care worker, consider paying them to be at the wedding to help care for the child.", ">(as long as they are well-behaved)\n\nHow are you going to make sure they behave?", "How would you feel if you disallow stepsister's kids, so they don't come or possibly the entire family doesn't come, and then the other, normally well behaved kids run around screaming at your wedding?", "I find it interesting how you didn\u2019t even consider helping the parent attend *your* event before you considered excluding an autistic kid. If they\u2019re close enough to be invited, they\u2019re close enough for you to consider accommodations and assistance for their kid.", "Disabled or not op can invite who she wants. \n\nStill going with NTA", "It's not unreasonable to expect to children behave. When people should be quiet parents should do their best to keep kids quiet or take them outside/away from the area.\n\nThe thing is if you don't tell her that it's only her kids not invited she'll find out at the wedding. If you do tell her she may also be upset. I don't know the specifics of her son but letting kids run around and in restaurants isn't okay. So she may not react well if you tell her it's her children specifically not invited. Is that something you and your partner are prepared to deal with?", "One of them she's going to exclude is an infant...", "In that case don\u2019t invite stepsister..", "There was no violence mentioned. Where are you getting that?", "Kids scream and run around. All kids do. For whatever reason, any of the kids attending could have a tantrum, a meltdown, trip and hurt themselves, do little kid shit. Kids are kids. Insisting that one kid should be excluded because there\u2019s a higher chance he\u2019s going to do kid shit is ridiculous.", "There are several children under 10 invited. Children under 10 are not known for their calm and never-disruptive natures. \n\nThis kid is being excluded because he's autistic. \n\nShe finds his behaviors wrong even though he is also still a child. She isn't psychic. She has no idea how he will respond to this event. She is putting all her eggs in \"This kid is autistic and might disturb me\" instead of \"Kids are unpredictable, maybe I don't want that chaos at my wedding.\"", "This is a far fetched take with a whole lot of \"what ifs.\" Literally ANY of the children attending could do this stuff. Why is it on the autistic kid to be the target of potential mishaps?", "I don't know how much I trust the OPs perception of a kid who she doesn't regularly see and is likely hearing stories secondhand. She stated Fiance and Stepsister aren't close and they do not see them regularly. \n\nWe don't know to what degree he is doing this.\n\nAll we know is this OP is looking for reasons to not invite an autistic kid because he MIGHT do something, when there are other children under 10 who are coming, including an infant. \n\nWould I rather hear a grunting autistic kid having a good time or a screaming infant? I know my choice.", "She can definitely invite who she wants, and she can be an asshole if she wants.", "Kids should be expected to be respectful during the ceremony but after that they will likely need an outlet for their energy. It would be ideal to have a playroom or some kind of kids area at the reception, along with a wrangler.", "That was my recommendation too. She would probably make some noise, but they're not in each other's lives so who cares?", "Most 10 years can behave with correct parenting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much as the child being autistic but more so that the stepsister is a not so good parent and can\u2019t control her kids not even the middle child who doesn\u2019t seem to have autism.", "Because the mother has already proven that she won't take any responsibility for him whereas the op says the other parents have proven they do take responsibility for their kiddos. Personally I'd probably just invite the stepsister and kiddos with the caveat that she needs to be watching them and keeping them near her at all times or she'll be asked to leave and will be responsible for any damage her kids do.", "Op and her fianc\u00e9 are NTA for doing what they want and feel would make their day and the guests day better. After all this is their special day. Not the stepsister or her sons", "In one breath she says they aren't close and then in the next she seems to know how this child behaves wherever he is. We don't know what the truth is. His mother hasn't proven a damn thing to us."]}
