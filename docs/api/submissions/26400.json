I always used to feel like she was replacing my mom when I was younger, and my dad just turned a blind eye to it all. However, over the past few years since lockdown we\u2019ve really started getting on better and I thought everything had changed, but I was wrong.\nI live in the UK so now that I have turned 18 and left college I\u2019m going to move into university next Saturday (I\u2019m writing this just over a week before move in day) and I honestly can\u2019t wait. Since June, my stepmom and I haven\u2019t gotten on. I fell out with my dad over the smallest thing in June, which we have since made up about and sorted out, and yet my stepmom took it upon herself to not speak to or even look at me since this happened. A couple of weeks ago she bought my brother 3 packs of his favourite snacks, and when I asked if I could have one, she blatantly called me fat and told me I need to lose weight so no. This genuinely really hurt me because my weight is my biggest insecurity and she didn\u2019t have to be so horrible about it. It\u2019s now September and she has done everything in her power to avoid me. \nWe went out for a family meal two days ago and I was sat diagonally from my stepmom, and yet she still didn\u2019t even make eye contact with me the entire time we were there, so I decided to bring the issue up to my dad.\nI told him that I\u2019d noticed her avoiding eye contact with me and asked him if she still had a problem with me, even though I already knew the answer. Just as I asked him that, she came back to the table and asked me what I was talking about. It was a family member\u2019s birthday so I decided to leave the matter until we got home, so I didn\u2019t ruin the meal.\nOnce we got home I sat down in the living room with my stepmom and told her that if she didn\u2019t get her ideas together and stop acting so childish around me over the next week before I leave, I will never speak to her again. I told her I don\u2019t care about her anymore, and the next four years of my life at university will change me as a person so she will not know who I am when I come back if she chooses to keep being a child.\nAs you can probably imagine, she didn\u2019t take this well. Her face got sour and she went to bed early, and frankly I couldn\u2019t care less. However, my dad was really upset with me for being so blatant with her. The only person who is on my side is my mother, who doesn\u2019t like her either. \nSo I\u2019m really just asking if I\u2019m the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I was told in the comments I should add this as an edit but I have tried and tried to talk to my stepmom over the past few months, I didn\u2019t just jump off into the deep end like I made it sound \ud83d\ude05\nShe has been completely arrogant and won\u2019t even look at me most of the time unless she accidentally catches my eye.

(We only every came along when I was a kid say from age 9-13) I very much understand your reaction and I personally think you guys your relationship certainly won\u2019t get any better since like you said you\u2019ll change and grow as a person once you\u2019re in university.

I was asking my dad that as a rhetorical question because I already knew the answer, which is petty yes, but I don\u2019t think it warrants your response.

Best of luck!", "Um. This story clearly indicates that you two were not actually getting along (even if she may have acted that way) because, at least to me, it says: she waited for you to leave, trashed your room, and then lied about you to your dad to try to create a rift. And your dad seemingly doesn't believe you or you didn't tell him or he doesn't care, but he (and your brother?) are upset that you told off your stepmother for her weird behavior since?

But you gave her another chance, which is more than I would have done. With this extra info, you\u2019re clearly NTA, and I hope you\u2019ll have a great time at uni, and I hope your dad comes to his senses and will maintain a good relationship with you. I can be tough, but I know when I\u2019m wrong. I was wrong here.", "Remove anything you value from your dad's house because you never know what she will do.
