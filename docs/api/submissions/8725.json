That house is worth a lot and when, oops, I mean \"if\" you and your girlfriend divorce then it starts getting messy. She has no money, no assets. I am not giving my brother a house that can end up being hers. And no, a prenuptial doesn't guarantee against that. That's why I'm not giving it to him even though it's a small part of the real estate portfolio.\n\nI told him that as the executor of the estate, I'm open to them renting the place for $1 a month. I could rent it for over $2,000 BTW. I also reminded him who raised him after our dad died. \n\nHe's accusing me of keeping all of the estate money for myself.

If you are just the executor, the estate should have been settled by now.", "NTA  \nYou're the executor, Alex is not actually owed anything.  Unless your father left provisions for Alex after he was old enough to be out of his mother's house, Alex is not entitled to anything. \n\nTherefore, you do what you want.\n\nAlso, how did Alex start out as 23 and become 21 between the opening and 4th paragraph?", "NAH, Look it it from little bro's perspective though. He lost his dad and got nothing. Everything went to you. Now he's an adult and you're still keeping things from him. I'm sure there are various ways to let him have some ownership in the estate while shielding things from the girlfriend... put the home in a trust or something.", "NTA (for not giving ownership of the house specifically) and the renting for 1 dollar is a good idea. While I think it\u2019s pretty scummy to bank on his marriage failing, it\u2019s reasonable that you don\u2019t want your fathers estate to go to someone else if they get divorced. With one dollar a month rent you can act as if they own the house but they still legally don\u2019t, so it is protected. What you\u2019re doing about the house makes sense but seems like you need to check your attitude about \u201craising your brother\u201d and stop acting like he\u2019s still a teenager.", "NTA......I was executor for my Mom's estate and didn't want to release my brother's share because he's so bad with $$.....but I did and it's almost all gone.  She passed in April.\n\nHe's 56.", "NTA. Your offer of renting so cheaply was more than reasonable. You don\u2019t owe him a house as executor.", "NTA. I mean, if the marriage ends up lasting the test of time (sometimes they do!), you could surely give him a house later?  \n\nThat said, I\u2019m confused why your brother was disinherited. Why didn\u2019t your father just create a trust for him?", "NTA.\n\nThe lease decision makes perfect sense and still provides them a sense of security as a young family whilst keeping your brothers long-term financial best interests at heart.", "NTA\n\nYou will most likely lose the house to this gf if you give it to him right now. Maybe make some kind of deal with him that he can have the house in so many years or whatever criteria that you'd be comfortable with.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd I feel like the people saying otherwise are probably also 21. \n\nYou're literally not denying Alex ANYTHING, despite the fact that he is making very rash decisions that indicate that - predictably, for someone whose frontal cortex still has another 4-5 years of major growth left - he is literally still struggling with and may not even be ABLE to fully comprehend the long-term consequences of his current choices. In other words, he is still seeing things through a very adolescent, \"I want this right now therefore I need to have it immediately\" lens . . . impatient and not considering the possible negative impact on him down the road. \n\nYou are offering him exactly what he wants: a home for him and his girlfriend and her child. In fact, you're offering him exactly the home that he wants, and doing so in a manner that will make it reliably theirs for as long as they want/need it. There is no down side if he's right and this is his forever relationship. And if it is, you can always give him the home at some point down the road, and given that you clearly are concerned about his best interests, I assume that you would be open to that. But *for the time being*, it's best that it doesn't belong to him as an actual asset in his name. And that has nothing to do with him being your brother or you being controlling. A good money manager/financial advisor would tell him exactly the same thing. \n\nYou are NTA. Not only are you not legally or ethically obliged to put that property in his name, you are protecting him by giving him exactly the home he wants in a manner that protects his financial interests.", "NTA. If you want him to eventually have the house, put it in a trust for life with him as beneficiary and you as trustee.", "NTA - You are protecting him. If I was your brother I would take that deal in a heartbeat. The fact that he can't see the massive benefits of this arrangement proves he is not ready to own that house. \n\nThat last comment about your dad may have been a little uncalled for though.", "First he was 23 and now 21? What the hell?", "NTA for about 95% of this. That last comment about your dad was unneeded.", "NTA. The money and estate was left to you because that's what your dad wanted.\n\nYou are being more than generous with your offer to him.", "NTA. The rent thing is a good idea. If he has questions about the estate and where money is going maybe open the books with him and give him a little lesson about money it sounds like he has a lack of understanding. You are making smart decisions, show him why they\u2019re smart. Free housing is a huge advantage", "NTA.  I would charge them rent and set up at least part of the estate going to him in the future.  However, I agree I would not give him the house.  At least not at this point.", "NTA The guy is 21 and clueless. You\u2019re protecting him from himself. \n\nAlso, are you sure the baby\u2019s daddy is dead? That she didn\u2019t invent him?\n\nAnd, is he possibly mad bc his gf wants her hooks in his inheritance?", "NTA, and your brother\u2019s brash and impulsive actions and reactions prove exactly why he\u2019s not responsible enough yet to own the house outright.  $1 a month is *extremely* generous.  I doubt your brother knows what goes into maintaining a house but it is extremely hard work.  You\u2019re doing the right thing, OP.  He\u2019ll be sour but clearly he isn\u2019t ready for it yet.", "NTA. Your compromise of renting for $1 a month is more than reasonable. Well done for protecting your brother from financial abuse from his mother and gf.", "INFO: so when are you going to trust him? You were barely 4 years older when you claimed the whole inheritance.\n\n\n\nETA: how did your dad leave your brother out of the will? Many places dont allow disinheriting (non adult ) children completely.", "NTA my dude. He will grow up and thank you (never gonna happen) but unfortunately men (me included) think mostly with our second head", "NTA Think you are taking a long term view of this that he may later come back to appreciate.", "It\u2019s called a trust. You must have a lousy lawyer. \n\nEither that, or you like being in control of all the assets. \n\nHmmm\u2026 I wonder which option is correct in this case. \n\nYTA", "NTA for taking care of your little brother and looking out for him.  At 21 he's too young to realize marriage isn't always forever (my brother was married 4 times \"forever\" LOL).  Your solution to rent the house to him for a dollar is great.  While legally he isn't entitled to anything it's great you're sharing with him and helping him out.  Consider a \"rent to own\" agreement with him.  Rent for 10 years then \"sell\" the house to him if he's still married to the same gal.  That way you don't have to worry about her taking the house in a divorce early on.", "NTA, legally you don\u2019t have to give him anything but you agreed to pay child support to his mother and paid for his schooling and car. That\u2019s kind to do as he is your brother. Giving him a house if your father had many would also be really kind but you don\u2019t trust his fianc\u00e9? The renting for $1 is really generous because it\u2019s basically for free and protects him just in case. BUT you need to get to the root of the issue when it comes to not trusting his decisions and the paranoia of the fianc\u00e9. Not having a valid reason will definitely cause the brother to think your decision is unfair and throwing that you took care/raised him in his face when he doesn\u2019t like your decisions is only going to further his opinion you\u2019re being selfish and callous. You seem like you care but the way you\u2019re doing it makes you seem like Y T A.", "Yta, your bringing up too much about how your father died and you raised him, I agree what your doing is very kind so don\u2019t forget that. But maybe stop holding the stuff that you do against him", "Legally, apparently N T A, but morally, YTA.  I think there\u2019s the opportunity to work out a legal agreement that the property is in both his name and your name. You could talk to a real estate attorney about options to protect the asset, instead of dismissing him outright.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that you still view him as a child playing house and not as an adult building a family. I think you need to address that at some point.", "YTA definitely. You\u2019re bragging about not needing the money in the post about denying it to your brother. How could you be anything else?", "YTA all you\u2019ve done is brag about how you have much more than you need and rub it in his face. Also you don\u2019t know that the relationship will end in divorce that\u2019s just some random guess you made. Also you kinda came off a little sexist when complaining about her possibly owning the house if they did divorce, like you don\u2019t think a woman should own property but that might just be how I read it", "Your father wasn't exactly fair. You got everything, and your brother nothing. You didn't let him feel it before, but now you do it. Maybe because you just prefer not sharing - after all, seems like you don't have to - or because you don't agree with his decisions. Telling him that you would rent it to him means also telling him that you will take care that he is dependent on you... And that implicates that you can enforce  \"my house, my rules\" anytime. So your father was unfair and gave everything to the Golden son, and I guess you brother has to live with it... That is totally unrelated on whether his marriage fails or not. You had the possibility to make your decisions and live with them, with the backup of your large trustfund. Your father and you made sure that he hasn't got that possibility. If you want to be fair you could tell him that he also has to wait until he is 25 ,but the way you are presenting it, you don't plan to make your father's wrong right at all.", "In a way you emasculated him that he can't have a home your Father owned.  And I can see his POV to a degree.  Your Father trusted you to take care of him financially. And a home is not out of the realm of something he would have inherited under different circumstances.   Just because you assume they will divorce. Does not mean they will.  You are making a lot of assumptions.  And if you are so well off that a house does not impact you. Just let him have it and hope for the best.   A prenup can keep assets seperate and Judges abide by them. Depending where you live by State. If the house is in his name as a pre-marital asset. And she agrees not to go after it.  Don't get fooled by sensatonal media cases.  Plus, what does a home matter in a divorce.  If she is fertile she will push out a bunch of kids and have him on the hook for child support payments.  The house is the least of your worries.  If he is trying to create a perfect little family to make up for the one he doesn't have.  Just let him be happy.", "YTA. It's not up to you to decide if his relationship is going to fail. As a concerned brother, you can raise concerns. But it's his life. You can't take away things you've already given/agreed to simply because you don't like his choices. \n\nIt would be one thing if you wanted him to learn responsibility and get a job, etc. But that's not your problem. You just want to control him. \n\nYou said your dad only didn't include him in the inheritance to keep it from his mother, that doesn't mean your dad didn't want him to have it - so he should be getting some.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
