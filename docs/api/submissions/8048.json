It is not temp related and I am willing to have it at what they want. \n\nI was also told it\u2019s relevant in a comment to mention we are well insulated and what we set it to is normally higher. Set to 65 is usually around 66-68 and set to 68 is around 70-72. People in our building set it to 62 and same with people in our area. This isn\u2019t about what the temp should be set to but if I\u2019m wrong for asking them to compromise. \n\n\n\nThere are 4 of us living in a small apartment together. 2 of the girls are very wasteful energy wise and 1 of them is somewhat good. Before the winter started we agreed to keep the heat at 65. They break this rule occasionally and set the heat to 68. I lower the heat when I can especially when I\u2019m alone. \n\nHonestly 65 is too warm as I\u2019m still in shorts and a tshirt. It\u2019s currently snowing and I\u2019m in shorts which is wild.\n\nI went away for the weekend and could check the temp via app. From the moment I left till I came back I saw the heat was 68 or higher. It was even 70\u2019s at one point. Which is absolutely insane it\u2019s a 1,300 sqft apartment. \n\nI finally had enough and texted the group about it calling them out on this. I asked we keep it 65 as agreed or we cap my portion of the bill. I set the cap to be our highest bill yet which was nearly $400. Only one responded and she did not like it. She hates being told no and took this poorly. She said it was unfair to do that yet she racks up the vast majority of our bill. She\u2019s making me sound like an asshole and frankly I was scared to leave my room before and now I\u2019m even more scared. \n\nOur bill is 5x what my parents pay for their whole house. This is more than half the size and the cost is insanely high. The bill is energy and I cut out all I can already. I run laundry once a month to their 4 times a week each. I do other things like that to save costs. I\u2019m not asking for anything but the heat as that was established prior. \n\nI think I\u2019m the asshole as I am trying to force them to something that they don\u2019t want just to save money. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to negotiate a deal that is fair to all?\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is going off topic. This isn\u2019t asking if I\u2019m wrong about the temp but am I wrong for asking to stick to the agreement of what was decided or asking for a new compromise. I was told it would be wrong to compromise on this situation and have asked for many other things in exchange for putting the heat for 68. She has provided no other options just no. \n\nSo AITA for asking to stick to an agreement or compromise for where to go next?\n\nEdit 2:\n\nAgain it\u2019s not about the temp. I get I am the asshole for the temp even if that\u2019s too hot. \n\nI\u2019m asking about the deal. Am I wrong to ask to compromise or stick to the prior agreement?
