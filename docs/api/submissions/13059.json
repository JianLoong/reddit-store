He is basically giving the love token from his mate, to an upstart female. That is why it is wrong. She is also accepting what she is fully aware of as the wife's love token from a married man. She knows she is in the wrong and she doesnt care and that is why you feel threatened. It is like a man buying a love token of a dozen roses for his wife, then taking two of the roses out and giving them to his co worker before taking the remainder to his wife.
