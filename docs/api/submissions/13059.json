He is basically giving the love token from his mate, to an upstart female. That is why it is wrong. She is also accepting what she is fully aware of as the wife's love token, from a married man. She knows she is in the wrong and she doesnt care and that is why you feel threatened. It is like a man buying a love token of a dozen roses for his wife, then taking two of the roses out and giving them to his co worker before taking the remainder to his wife.

Plus, you and I will get quality time together to cook it, it'll save everyone on your team some money, and you'll have loads more friends we can have over for dinner parties.

I do soups, husband does pressure-cooked, spiced chicken that we pull apart with forks and add sauces to, then freeze in slow-cooker-sized blocks so that all the slowcooker has to do is warm it up. You just stir it occasionally as it thaws and warms, then serve it onto buns with a bit of optional shredded cheese on top, like a pulled pork except your Jewish and Muslim kids can have some also. Any inexpensive sauce will do. Buffalo is popular, the various barbecues are well-liked, one time we just did dill pickle juice, Lawry's No-Salt 17 and most of a bottle of honey mustard dressing on an 8th grader's suggestion and it came out tasting amazing. The secret was to use shredded mozzarella for topping that one. Same thing the time we did the shredded chicken with Italian seasoning, reheated it with some Prego sauce and the kid whose dad runs a bakery brought in loaves of garlic bread for buns. Mozzarella was just the cheese for that. Kids still talk about it and they write just the cutest thank-you notes to my husband any time we have Chicken Day, because they know I make soup, he makes chicken.  \n\n\nReally.

And even if it was \"normal\" it would still be okay for you to tell your husband that it makes you uncomfortable and you don't want to be making lunch for his colleague. \n\nAre you worried you'll be seen as jealous because you've tried to set boundaries in the past and he's pushed back at you? Or are you just worried, in an abstract way, and are letting that prevent you from communicating? \n\nIf the first, you've got a much bigger husband problem than it seemed at initially. \n\nIf the second, it's time to grow up a bit and do the work of having an adult relationship, which includes conversations wherein we have to be vulnerable with our partner which is scary but it's the only way to build connection, understanding, and intimacy. If he doesn't know you, how can you be good partners to eachother?", "I don't think giving someone your lunch on a regular basis counts as giving her a hint that her behaviour is unwanted.", "I think I'd be prepared to go another way. Make him two lunches, so he can give her one. Express my concern that she's unable/incapable of preparing lunch for herself as a grown adult, and how remarkably sad it is that she's in a financial bind that she has to depend on scraps from her coworker's lunch in order to be fed. I'd pack her a similar lunch with \"Chin up, Brenda!\" \"Hang in there!\" \"Sharing is caring, and I care about my husband's hungry coworkers!\"  \n\n\nBasically, let her know you know what she's trying, but have enough plausible deniability about just trying to be helpful that if she complains to anyone, she looks like an idiot.  \n\n\nAnd NTA, but you gotta play chess to her checkers!", "It\u2019s not even a little bit her doing.

Ask him what he would think if the shoe was on the other foot.", "You have every right to be jealous you\u2019re his wife and her behavior is unacceptable. She\u2019s well aware of the fact that he\u2019s married, but continuing to Act unappropriate if the shoe was on the other foot your husband wouldn\u2019t like it or if it was her husband she wouldn\u2019t like it not only are you putting all your thoughts and love energy and time into preparing these beautiful lunches for him you\u2019re also putting in finance now feeling an extra person is costing more money. You need to sit down and explain to him not only does it upset you because it feels like he doesn\u2019t appreciate all the thought loving care that you put into his lunches. It feels like you\u2019re being taken advantage of and being taken for granted, and that you feel like his coworker is getting a little too close for comfort, and that you\u2019re uncomfortable with the friendship. and that you feel like there\u2019s ulterior motives behind it\n\nEdit I forgot my verdict NTA 100000%", "She can\u2019t take a hint that isn\u2019t given. Your husband continues to share so she sees no issue with it. Unless you have indicated to her it is unwanted she has no clue it is.", "It\u2019s PRIMARILY a husband issue. She is not married to you. She owes you nothing. If your husband is sharing his own lunch with her he\u2019s the one in the wrong. If he feels so responsible for this woman\u2019s food- have him offer to lend her money to go buy her own lunch with the expectation that she will pay him back. He needs to learn to set professional boundary\u2019s.", "Are you sure that your husband as the only man in an otherwise all-women department can just freely make that specific coworker feel slighted by hard enforcing his personal boundaries and need for space, without receiving sexist backlash, creating a hostile work environment for himself and/or risking his job?", "Yeah\u2026that\u2019s jealousy. And there is nothing wrong with that! Just own it.", "How would she know this behavior is unwanted by you? Have you told her?", "Your husband is the one who should be responsible for putting up the walls to protect your marriage and keep out someone who is trying to get too close. Your husband is the one who is allowing her to put your marriage in jeopardy. Your husband is the one not giving the \"hint\". Of course she's not taking the hint, because he's not giving the hint. Your husband is the one you should be mad at, not her, because he's the one not standing up and putting a firm boundary in place. Lots of affairs start by a lack of firm boundary. They don't just jump into the affair. They creep into it with the weak boundary of \"I'm married\" slowly being chipped away at as that line of what's not ok continually being moved until they're having an affair. Ya'll need to have a serious talk about what's really going on. The lunches are just a symptom of a much much more serious threat happening before his very nose.", "Quite honestly though, your husband is an AH here too. Surely he senses this woman is too close for comfort. Why isn't he shutting her down and telling her his lunch is his own?", "No offense OP, but have you met this woman? Have you observed her bahaviour first hand or are you relying on your husband's account? Because your descriptions of her sound... off.", "See, when I started dating my hubby, a friend of his started pulling all kinds of jealous shit, it became clear she had him in mind as a \u201cfallback\u201d plan though he never entertained that thought himself.\n\nHe, without any prompting from me, decided that was disrespectful to him and his relationship and me, and told her to cut it out.  I trusted him so I stayed out of it and let him handle it.  He ended up needing to cut her off.\n\nTalk to husband and find out why he is willing to allow her to disrespect him and hint that he is the type to have an emotional affair with her actions.  You don\u2019t have to make this about you, it\u2019s about her not treating his partner and his relationship with respect and why he\u2019s ok with that.", "It's completely your husband's fault. Unless you are at his work all the time and are observing the behavior, it's all on him.", "This reminds me of the Lunchbox movie", "Speaking of fish, OP should cook fish for dinner often and pack him the leftover fish for lunch every time. Warming it up in the microwave will keep everyone at a distance.

If that doesn\u2019t sound like jealousy I don\u2019t know what does lol", "So you don't find it strange that a GROWN woman is clearly going out of her way to be given lunch instead of doing what a normal person does and buying / making herself some? Also, whenever I eat some of my friends' food, I always make sure to make them something or buy them something in return, while op is unwillingly spending time, effort and money on some random chick she doesn't know without getting anything in return.

He\u2019s gotten a lot better with a verbal issues since we got married, I just don\u2019t like this coworker situation, the thing is, it\u2019s less of a coworker situation and more of a friendship. This girl has come to our several times even though I was very against it my feelings were not respected, he said \u201c because you\u2019re insecure I can\u2019t have my friend over?\u201d And more along those lines, I forbid them to be friends on Facebook, and when she requested him, he immediately added her and then, when I got upset, he threw a fit, so I just went ahead and added her on my account to not cause a big stink but to let her know that if she wanted to friend him, she could friend both of us.

Sharing food, especially things people may not have tried before, is quite common in my experience. Maybe this is an urban vs. suburban/rural thing? Or a regional thing (though I've lived MANY places)? What's weird to me is that she's not bringing/getting her own lunch. Typically, such sharing arrangements are reciprocal, and people don't just expect to mooch off someone else...so I guess that's what you might mean.", "Just tell him this.

You understand he interacts with those students daily and might understand why they might not have lunch and be hungry though right? Like he might grow attached to them as his wards during their time in his class..Nothing wrong with being empathetic to a hungry kid. If anything, i'd think someone would feel more attached to their SO if they found he would ocassionally give his lunch to a starving student...Like that's a pretty decent empathetic human thing to do honestly.", "Yep. You bet if this was an older unattractive teacher doing this he would be disgusted and shut it down. \n\nmy kids are junior high and early high school and you can tell the teachers that are a bit inappropriate with each other.
