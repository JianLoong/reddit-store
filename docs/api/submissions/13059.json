Your husband is participating in giving your lovingly prepared lunch away. So why aren't you asking him to stop?", "INFO  have you talked to your husband that you think she is flirting with him? Does she know he is married?", "Not the NTA... Maybe it's her excuse to get closer to him. (are you suspicious of this interaction?).   For the next week maybe send him the blandest depressive looking lunch possible, Tell your husband you are going to be busy, so you'll prepare something simple throughout the week (don't alert him).... if she still tries to eat with him... Well she is pinning for him.   \n\nGood luck", "nta- tell his work wife to make her own lunches and tell your husband he\u2019s being too \u201cfriendly\u201d bc the kids at school probably know them as the married teachers that are too close (every school had one lawl)", "As an educator myself, I can tell you schools are THE place to find hookups and cheat. Haven\u2019t done it, but I\u2019ve seen it for 12 years. Please be careful. This doesn\u2019t sound good. Just because he\u2019s telling you, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not being flirty. The fact that he\u2019s sharing his lunch is suspicious enough. You\u2019re pregnant. Get your ducks in a row and be prepared for anything. Good luck!", "NTA - It's one thing if it was a one-off or a colleague really happened to forgot their lunch that day. But if this is a common occurence to the same co-worker, I'd feel my efforts are not being respected too.", "NTA but it appears you are jealous. Anyway, put your money where your mouth is: if she is a grown woman and should be cooking for himself, so is he (well, a grown man) - and he should be making his own lunch too. (And your grocery money should not be going towards feeding his coworkers either. I mean, once, I can imagine - twice, also. But three times and above is a pattern).", "Info: How do you know that this woman does this? I assume your husband told you? If thats the case what have those conversations been?", "You've gotten great advice so I'll just give you some reassurance. \n\nYour feelings are ALWAYS valid. Whether you're jealous or not is irrelevant. You're allowed to be, and there is cause to be but again, irrelevant.  Your feelings are hurt, period. Please talk to your husband. I agree with the commenter who said that he's telling you for a reason. He knows that this coworker is out of line and it seems like he's trying to reassure you, as well as himself, that it's nothing.\n\n*edited to add NTA", "NTA maybe he's checking to see what you're ok with. Time to emphasize quantity over quality, so you guys can afford his daily generosity to young ladies at work. Get some cups of noodles and whatever he likes in bologna sandwiches :)", "Send him in with less food.", "NTA Maybe is time for him to start making his own lunches. Maybe that way he will start to appreciate the effort you put in your relationship, and if he doesn't then he is clueless or he is just a bad husband. Is he putting the same effort in making you happy as you are?", "NTA\n\nLet him make his own fancy lunches to share with own fancy lady.", "Slightly TA: you can tell this comes from a place of pure jealousy because you think the gender of the coworker was worth mentioning.", "Don't know why you are making a 30 Yr olds lunch in the first place .", "NTA I could see this happening maybe once or twice but if this is consistently happening, there is something going on. Probably not on your husbands part but most definitely on the other teachers part. She knows exactly what she is doing. As for sharing with his students, if they have nothing else to eat, I can see that as okay as long as its not every day. I think it would be okay if you just mentioned, not make too big of a deal about it, that you feel this woman needs to find her own food to eat. But in the end, its your husband that is going to have to make that decision.

I am afraid to come off as jealous :/", "Yuuuup!", "Yes she does, she\u2019s a pick me type, he chooses to keep her close though, i doubt its anything serious but I just get uncomfortable with the entire situation.

He has pictures of us in his classroom and does share about his personal life, in fact all his teacher friends and students are well aware that we are expecting our first child in April,", "Probably because I have reasons to be, she\u2019s too close to him but that a whole other issue, he has given portions of his lunch to his begging students too, maybe he should make his own lunches at this point", "Because people in relationships do nice things for each other. Why is this even a question? \n\nYou could list various things people do for each other in relationships, and say \u201cwhy are you doing that for them? They\u2019re an adult who can do it themselves.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s because they love each other, and wanna do things for the person they love. It\u2019s that simple.

Grow up dude.", "He tells me, that he enjoyed his lunch and that he felt bad for the coworker and shared with her because she didn\u2019t bring food for herself, my response is usually along the lines of \u201c can this grown woman not cook for herself\u201d and he says, \u201cno I guess not, sometimes her mom sends her a lunch but its rare\u201d", "You're his wife. You get to be jealous if the situation warrants it. But this lunch situation isn't really about jealousy, though. This is your reaction to his disrespect of the effort you put in.", "I\u2019m going to go ahead and add the fact that this one particular coworker is a bit too close for comfort, because its also about that, I don\u2019t feel jealous, I feel rather annoyed that she can\u2019t seem to take a hint that he\u2019s married and her behavior is unwanted, at least by me, however I know this is not all her doing, it takes two to tango, I am fully aware it\u2019s also a husband issue :/", "I think it's important to remember that he's telling you about this, so he knows there's something weird about it (even if he's not doing something wrong, per se), and you shouldn't feel like you can't tell him your thoughts about it. The situation is so weird and awkward, too, because I know I'd be uncomfortable if I were you but I also know I'd feel weird denying someone food?

You have a big husband problem. He should not be sharing his marriage problems with them, throwing you under the bus, and then telling you that they think you\u2019re being crazy. \nAlso, schools can\u2019t force teachers to go on week long field trips.", "Ok this is weird. \n\nYou stopped him from going to a WORK event because you were 7 months pregnant!?  And you think that\u2019s normal. \n\nBut you don\u2019t want to stop making him fancy lunches because you might sound jealous (even though that\u2019s more about him disrespecting your efforts). \n\nYou have these badly mixed up. \n\nIt should be a small thing to say: I make those lunches to show my love for you, and they take quite a bit of effort. When you give the food away it makes me feel that you don\u2019t value them as signs of love. So I will choose a different way to express my love & you can start making your own lunches / I\u2019ll make you a basic sandwich.\u201d\n\nBut are you trying to get him sacked / never promoted at work? If it was a legitimate work trip then you should not be congratulating yourself that you blocked him from going for crazy jealous reasons. \n\nSo NTA about the lunches (the point of this post) but kinda the AH for the rest.", "Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but It sounds like you haven\u2019t told him that *shes* the problem and you\u2019re blaming the students?", "I guess it\u2019s my way of showing my love language, I criticize her because I am not cooking for her, I\u2019m sure she can make her own food, its not just about the food, I definitely feel uncomfortable with their friendship, but back on the topic she purposely seeks out his food, she will hang around when he\u2019s eating in his classroom", "I think that\u2019s very sweet of you, but he\u2019s not appreciating it if he\u2019s giving it away, especially after you\u2019ve asked him to stop. \nAnd again, I think you\u2019re being a little too harsh toward her with the \u201cgrown woman\u201d attitude, when you are worried about your \u201cgrown man\u201d husband being hungry if you don\u2019t pack his lunch every day.  Why should she be capable of feeding herself but he isn\u2019t, and will go hungry if someone doesn\u2019t do it for him? It comes off a little sexist. \nI would slide away from the \u201cshe\u2019s a grown woman\u201d stuff and stick with the \u201cI pack these out of love and they are for you and only you.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m also concerned about your other comment, where he\u2019s throwing you under the bus and telling them about your marriage problems.

It sounds like you do a lot for him, and he doesn\u2019t fully respect you back.", "I had major issues with my blood pressure around that time and was nervous about baby coming sooner than expected, due to suspected preeclampsia, it all calmed down thanks to magnesium drip, but I was also put on bedrest by my Dr, I was afraid that God forbid anything happen he would be on a bus out of state and unable to make it home. I later found out that he also lied about not being able to get out of the trip, he actually volunteered to go chaperone without telling me, and when i told him my concerns his excuse was \u201cbut I really want to travel\u201d", "Yeah no I haven\u2019t told him about how I feel about him sharing with her, at least not completely, I just kinda made a snarky comment like \u201c that food is for you please don\u2019t share it with anyone \u201c  because the second I tell him its a concern regarding her, it becomes \u201cbut shes just my coworker, are you jealous?\u201d", "Her wanting your food would not matter in the slightest if he stopped giving it to her. His behavior is the problem. I know it\u2019s easier to blame her, but he is the one choosing to give your food away. \nMaybe try explaining to him that this is your love language and this food is a symbol of your love for him. So it feels to you like he\u2019s giving that love to another woman.", "Its not just about the food to be honest, I don\u2019t like how close she is to my husband, she\u2019s kind friendly with me but very short, when I see her but you can tell just how close her and my husband are at work by their interactions, they have inside jokes, a handshake, she\u2019s just a bit too close idk how to explain it, guess I just have to accept that he has a \u201cwork wife\u201d", "YTA if you don't leave that asshole SMH  he lied about that I wonder what else he lies about", "I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with this. I think you should trust your gut on things like this, and it\u2019s definitely not something you just have to accept. \nI would try talking to your husband more- full honesty and transparency about your feelings and concerns.  It may help.", "No, you don\u2019t need to accept it. Your husband needs to learn to have healthy boundaries with his coworkers."]}
