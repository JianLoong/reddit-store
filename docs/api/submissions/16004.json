Being a parent is not for everyone and no one should be obligated to have a kid if they don\u2019t want one, but, what you said is completely true. If no one had children, there would not be doctors, bus drivers, grocery store clerks, hairdressers, farmers, and on and on. Your sister seems a bit self-absorbed to not be able to accept that the world does not revolve around her and her needs.", "NTA. People are 100% entitled to living a child-free lifestyle. Most people who don\u2019t want kids really shouldn\u2019t have kids anyways. However, not wanting kids does not equal everyone around you putting their kids second to your needs. \n\nYour sister is an adult. If she doesn\u2019t want to deal with adults with young children she\u2019s more than capable of finding child-free friends who can do spontaneous things with her. And you\u2019re not wrong, if no one had anymore kids she would get 0 help in her 80s and 90s", "NTA. She's not talking about kids in the abstract. She's talking about specific family members and treating them as a nuisance which deserves the response you gave her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t shame her for not having kids, you pointed out her shitty attitude about kids in general. She the one complaining about people who made a different choice than her. It\u2019s fine she doesn\u2019t want kids, but she can\u2019t then complain about people she chooses to have in her life who do have kids. Why isn\u2019t she out there trying to find new friends who are also child free?", "Nta. Being childfree is a valid choice. However your sister is selfish expecting everyone to basically abandon their kids for her convenience. She demands respect for being \"childfree by choice\" yet doesn't proffer respect to those who parent by choice. She is a hypocrite. I also wonder if there is some sourgrapes going on. Is she truly childfree by choice or maybe no one wanted to procreate with her because she is such an A h.", "It\u2019s one thing not to like kids. A a whole other thing to not like other people having kids. That\u2019s so unreasonable.

She got increasingly angry that I had to spend time with my child. I'm all about babysitters too. So it wasn't like we didn't have opportunities to hang out says kids. In the end she wrote me a ten page letter detailing how disappointed she was with me. I told her, it's clear you need to find friends with as much free time as you have. OP's sister needs to find child free friends and build her own supportive friend group. NTA", "NTA. A little rude but her mindset was pretty rude too.", "YTA. Childfree people cannot express any frustration over their families and friends putting them dead last on their list of priorities because it always ends up with a parent going on a rant how noble of a choice becoming a parent is.", "NTA\n\nWhat do you have to apologize for? She is so entitled she wishes you didn't have kids so that you can wait on her hand and foot instead!", "NTA\n\nThis was very entitled of your sister to ask you (or anyone) to prioritize her, instead of the kids. Your kids are your responsibility, she isn't.\n\nI think your sister's barking up the wrong tree when she's upset that you can't satisfy her social needs to the detriment of your children. While you can make plans to be together, it's a given that you need to work around your children's schedule, duh! She needs to make some child free friends, if she wants people who can just drop everything to be there for her.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds entitled and immature and the type of person who blames everyone for their unhappiness.

Whereas she isn't accepting of your decision because of the constant sneer or jab at you for having kids. \n\nYou can't up and leave for a trip because your sister wants you too. She must understand that you have responsibilities that come first. Otherwise she needs to make friends with child free people. \n\nMy sister is child free.

I only tell if she asks or I tell her when it's an emergency. \n\nLike I said acceptance goes both ways.", ">Ugh I can't wait till everyone's kids are grown and we can just do stuff again.\n\n\nwhy did this strike a nerve its literally a thought that all parents get eventually.\n\nESH", "NTA. Having a child makes me sympathize with other parents. I don't be an asshole trying to get them to calm their kid loudly in restaurant or when they act out in a movie. Sometimes I can't have plans with friends or family because my little one has gymnastics or we're going out for father daughter time  It's perfectly natural. If anything, non-parents only have a right to complain when the parents do NOTHING to help calm down their child or when the parent seems completely neglectful of the child's needs. Your sister doesn't seem like the type of person to care. Hope she has a plan when the kids in the family grow up and no one wants to take care of her grumpy @$$.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is behaving like a child.", "ESH. Your sister sounds exhausting. I get her frustration that no one seems to put her first or be interested in helping her. She has stated her feelings multiple times on this issue though. Everyone knows how she feels. There\u2019s no need for her to go on at every opportunity. \n\nBut you also don\u2019t need to snap back in the way that you did. I mean, when your sister was incapacitated you could have called around for your kid to carpool to sport so she could be helped when the person she paid to help her was unavailable. It seems like she has made as much of an effort as possible not to rely on family in recognition of the fact she\u2019s not willing to help with kids.

You guys get to do way more fun stuff together. Yes the kids will be more independent and want to hang with friends but it\u2019s not like you will always be free to hang later on. You and your husband might not want a third wheel around all the time when the time comes. Nothing to apologize for you made your choices and she made hers.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't shame her for not having kids.

She\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA she was acting ungrateful and whiny when she was lucky she had people trying so hard to help her at all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her choosing to not have kids, but her dislike of kids seems to come from her resenting that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, and that mindset deserves to be called out.", "NTA you would have thought her being laid up with no one to care for her but family would have given her newfound appreciation for some of the benefits family (including children) can have as we age.  We have children but my BIL doesn\u2019t and I always worry about what will happen to him as he gets older, since we live in another country. If he ever needs help he\u2019s screwed. Who will come round and make sure he didn\u2019t fall? Who will check that he hasn\u2019t started to lose his marbles? Who will visit him in the home he will inevitably end up in? I\u2019m worried for everyone as a society as a generation comes up where most won\u2019t have children who will care about them when they\u2019re 80. It\u2019s definitely not a reason to have kids (for sure) but perhaps one of its benefits.", "tbh I get it because all my friends have kids and while I love being auntie, it\u2019s a bit lonely not having anyone to do last minute frivolous things with, and it\u2019s nerve wracking to do it solo. but that\u2019s not something I throw in my friends\u2019 faces, omg. she could benefit from a therapist. NTA", "One of my asshole friends like this is so selfish, never married etc. Fine never being married or having kids but when they want slam others who do that is wrong. My kids are grown now and I am dealing with elderly parents and that annoys my friend. She does not help with her parents so my doing so bugs her.

Your sister is entitled to live her life how she wants, but it\u2019s unfair to expect people who have families and associated commitments to just make themselves available at the drop of a hat.", "NTA. You didn't shame her for not having kids. You reminded her the world does not revolve around her, and that the natural consequence of her life is she needs to plan for care because there won't be anyone to help take care of her.", "I apologized to her because it was very clear that I upset her. She doesn't usually just up and leave like that.", "Same here on the struggling to understand!", "Especially because the sister is an adult. She doesn\u2019t need constant care. Kids do. That\u2019s how it works.", "I do understand some people's frustration about having kids and the impact it has on interacting with other adults, but I suppose it's more there's a limit to it? Especially when, since she does not want to help with the kids at all, she's taking herself out of the helping pool when I need it, and that's fine, but don't turn around and consistently complain that I or someone else she knows isn't dropping everything to help her with whatever she needs if that makes sense.", ">But please bear in mind that child-free folk do often get the worse deal.\n\nHaving lived as an adult without children for over a decade and with one for five years, this is the funniest line I've seen all week.", "I mean, parents kind of *have* to prioritize their kids first\u2026If not they\u2019ll get taken away.", "Lol, what, should people just ignore their kids, the people they chose to have and are responsible for, because someone feels left out? It\u2019s fine if someone is child free, but of course they will come after a person\u2019s kids in the list of priorities. They\u2019re adults! Kids aren\u2019t. And parents have an obligation to their kids, not to other family or friends.", "Are we just ignoring the entitlement of the sister here?  I'm childfree but would never talk to my sister that way for prioritizing her family. I wouldn't expect anything more from my other sibling without children than I would from the one who has them. We're adults and being an adult means figuring your own shit out, not pouting because someone's child was (rightfully) prioritized especially when we're living in a time of DoorDash and Instacart. Sooo sorry she had to wait for her Doritos while her sibling was investing her kid's life.", "Yeah and how much the childless person is selfish for not producing offspring. \n\nYTA, op.", "Getting that thought once, yes. Getting it multiple times and for her to complain about not getting help or hanging out with her on a whim because we have kids, while we respect her boundaries of her not helping with or doing anything involving the kids. Yes, it is extremely frustrating to have unlimited availability expected of you but don't receive it in turn.", "Because OP is doing stuff, living the family life and her sister is being shitty about it.", "Because kids aren't some hardship to work through if they are wanted. Children grow up but they are still sons and daughters and super important in their parents lives. Don't treat other people's life choices as a personal inconvenience to your whims.", ">you could have called around for your kid to carpool to sport\n\nGetting our son to his game wasn't the issue, the issue would then be that only one of our kids had one of us at their game, while the other didn't. That's not fair to our kids.", "yeah, op not helping her sister with a broken leg because her kid had a sports game kind of sucked.", "> What she said wasn't wrong and what you said is kind of a moot point. \n\nI would agree \u2026 except it is fairly obvious that her point was passive aggressive, and it is relevant that this woman is complaining about not getting what she needs when she needs it because of people having kids\u2026 when OP is correct that other people\u2019s kids will eventually be the reason she gets what she needs, because she didn\u2019t have any of her own. \n\n> It isn't your sister's job to populate an already overpopulated world, \n\nOP did not say or even remotely imply this *at all.* like\u2026 *at all.*\n\n> and that has nothing to do with her frustration over trying to get help when she needs it because of choices others have made.\n\nNo no\u2026 no\u2026 because of the choices *she* has made, and/or the circumstances life has dealt her. And they are VALID choices, before you jump down my throat, but it\u2019s no one *else\u2019s* fault she doesn\u2019t have someone besides siblings to help her out immediately in this situation. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she deserves it; I\u2019m saying that\u2019s just \u2026 life. \n\nIt is not other people\u2019s responsibility to come to her immediate aid, and her family DID come to her aid as soon as they actually could. \n\n> It is really limiting to be childfree in your 30s/40s.  I'm CF and 34 and it limits my social opportunities a lot. It sucks to have friends and family constantly flaking out on you.  It's hard to make new friends.\n\nIt\u2019s also very freeing. And if you\u2019re child free by choice\u2026 those are the limitations you chose. Those who have kids, like OP, are limited by the obligations that come with having kids. Which are rather significant, and which they also chose.\n\n> I broke my leg a few years back. I had no help whatsoever. I had to take an Uber to and from the hospital. \n\nSame. And I would expect nothing else as a child free single adult living alone if my family were busy. Of course it is difficult. It\u2019s okay to be upset. But to insinuate that it\u2019s due to other people\u2019s choices is audacious as hell. OP came to help when they could.\n\n> I have learned that I can't rely on anyone. I had to cook, buy groceries, drive myself to work, and make my way through snowy, unshoveled streets by myself. \n\nLmao\u2026 yes\u2026. and? This is the life is a single, child-free adult. And also extremely not difficult. Did you honest to Jesus just mention *cooking,* and *buying groceries,* and *driving yourself to work,* and *shovelling* as the things making your life difficult? Millions of single adults from 18-80 do this by themselves all the time. Daily. \n\nAnd married people with kids have to do this twice as much\u2026 because they have kids. They have to do *more,* not *less.* They don\u2019t just have to drive themselves to work, they have to drive their kids all over the place as well. They have to buy groceries for their entire family, cook for their entire family. \n\nAnd yes that\u2019s their choice\u2026.  just as much as this woman\u2019s decision to be child free is a choice.\n\nIs it much more difficult with a broken leg? Absolutely. Is that anyone else\u2019s responsibility? No. Is it easier when you have kids? Not necessarily. In fact, it can be even harder if you have young kids you also have to take care of on top of having a broken leg and getting *yourself* taken care of. \n\n> I am proud of my self-reliance\n\nThen\u2026 be proud? Also, this is basic adulting. I was proud of this level of self-reliance when I was 18 years old. By all means be proud. That\u2019s fantastic. More people should be proud of their everyday accomplishments. \n\nExcept it rings a little empty when you\u2019re going to follow it up with a complaint.\n\n> but you aren't realizing the kind of privileges you have.\n\n\u2026. Says who? What part of OP\u2019s comment suggested they don\u2019t realize the privilege of having a family of their own?\n\nThey just didn\u2019t appreciate OP\u2019s blatant resentment.\n\n> You really should try to put yourself in your sister's shoes.\n\nOP has empathy. OP went over to help when they could. Sure sister is probably frustrated and suffering, but I\u2019ve been there too, and I do not resent my family one bit for telling me to tone it the fuck down because my situation, while frustrating, is not their fault.\n\n> And no, her decision not to have kids and still wanting help from others has nothing to do with not babysitting your kids because SHE'S CHILDFREE.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s her decision. And it\u2019s valid. And OP would not have brought it up if she had not turned around and acted like OP owed her immediate unconditional support, when she has made it clear she isn\u2019t willing to provide it back.\n\nLittle ironic that the reason OP couldn\u2019t help her right away was because they couldn\u2019t find a babysitter for their kids last minute.. no?  Not her fault, not her responsibility, of course. \n\nBut I would be pissed off too if I were OP and my family was constantly acting like my kids are nothing but a temporary inconvenience in their life.\n\n> She made the choice to not have kids and not be around kids, \n\nCorrect. \n\n> and that does not mean she has to babysit yours, \n\nCorrect \n\n> or that she can't be upset when her hired help cancels when she's broken a limb and can't walk.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t make her *not* an asshole (not evil, but an asshole in that moment, in pain and frustrated or not) for making a thoughtless comment like that. And OP is not the asshole for being upset by it.", "As far as I'm aware she can. She was firmly in the  'no kids ever' camp in college so I don't know if she ever had inclination to check.", "\ud83d\ude06", "Your sister is being oversensitive and unfair. She clearly did get help when she needed it despite the fact that she doesn't seem willing to help in return (babysit). I imagine she gets a fair amount of flak for not having kids and that must be irritating but she should not take it on you.\n\nCalling her a narcissist based on this is ridiculous.\n\nMaybe let everyone cool down and meet for a nice chat. Her broken leg might have made her aware of her vulnerability as a childless older person and she may just be a bit oversensitive at the moment.\n\nI am not suggesting people should have kids to take care of them. That is incredibly selfish.", "In my opinion, you didn't say anything mean or that wasn't true. \n\nIt seems like she was upset because she was being rude again about your choice to have children, and you responded by explaining the basic concept of the need for maintaining the population. \n\nHer not liking what you said doesn't necessarily mean that you were in the wrong.", "That\u2019s fine, if the apology was necessary for smoothing over your relationship then whatever works for you works.

One that, if it doesn't heal properly, can lead to chronic pain and mobility problems for life.\n\nBut hey, your kids had a sports schedule.\n\nOf course she seemed frustrated.

On the one hand, her comment was insensitive (especially toward the one person who DID help her), it sounds like she expected help on her terms despite being perhaps unwilling to provide the same in return, and she doesn\u2019t seem to understand that people not being able to be spontaneous doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care. Honestly I know plenty of people *without* kids who either can\u2019t or won\u2019t just do things whenever because of jobs, pets, preference, other family, etc. Like I\u2019m pregnant with my first kid and most of my friends don\u2019t have kids and there may be like two people I know who are able and willing to up and go on a dime like that. Actually, now that I think about it, I know a couple WITH kids who are just as likely to be spontaneous as those who aren\u2019t (but, they\u2019re fortunate in terms of kid ages/interests and babysitter availability).\n\nOn the other hand, she was *immobile* the day she needed help and you couldn\u2019t miss a bit of game, get someone to take her food or stand in for you at the game, or anything sooner? It seems like something could have been coordinated considering she was *that* helpless at the time, and that perhaps an injury like that is extreme enough that a sporting event shouldn\u2019t take precedence. My mom went to every sport game my brother ever had and I can\u2019t imagine that she\u2019d let helpless family member wait through a game to help if she could. And I can tell you that sitting around with a broken bone and unable to do much takes a HEAVY toll on one\u2019s mental and emotional health. EVERYTHING cuts deeper than it normally would because you can\u2019t do much except stew in whatever feelings you have, and the negative ones are the worst. They amplify, and it takes a while *after* recovery to really realize exactly how much. And it sounds like she was alone for much of it. Of course she\u2019s going to be extra sensitive and salty now. \n\nAnd your comment was a bit\u2026silly? Yes, everyone who will help her was once someone\u2019s kid.

No one is superior here, and no one is hard done by either.", "I don't feel like I have enough information to really make a call here, but based on the limited information, I'm leaning towards YTA because that was an assholish thing to say to your sister. She expressed her frustration at not being able to spend quality adult time with her sister (and it sounds like others) and you responded by demeaning her and her life.\n\nLet me give you a little perspective on what it's probably like from her side.\n\nI have friends with kids and friends without kids. I obviously see the friends without kids more often than the friends with kids because they have a bit more freedom with their schedules and I understand that. I hold no grudges on that front. I knew when they had kids things were going to change and everyone in the group was going to have to adapt to maintain the relationships, so I did. A lot of our hangouts changed from going out to visiting their homes and I understand that. I love my niblings. I go to events and games, take them out every couple of months, and never forget to spoil them a bit. But at a certain point, adults just want to spend time with other adults doing adult things. My oldest nibling is 13 years old. I can count on one hand the amount of interactions I have had with my friends with kids in that time period that did not have their kids involved. I have taken their kids out without them more than I have taken them out without their kids. I haven't been able to talk them into getting a sitter to go out to dinner for one evening in seven years.\n\nI urge you to look at your relationship with your sister and how you are interacting with her and consider some things. How much time do you spend with her without your kids? When you went over after the game, was your kid with you? Are your conversations centered around the children? When she asks you to do things and you tell her no because of the kids, are you suggesting alternatives that work better for you? For example, the day trip, if you can't go one weekend because of the kids activities, are you suggesting another time or another childless activity, like you can't take the whole day, but you could do brunch or dinner that day? How often do you have to cancel on her or ghost her because of the kids?

My god how thin is your skin if you think staying the very true fact that once people's kids are grown the parents will have more free time to spend with other family & friends is *shitting on everyone else's kids* ?? It was a useless, cruel thing to say for no other reason than enjoying the high horse parents love to sit on when talking to people without kids. \n\nAnd people in these comments saying needing to eat something, or go to the bathroom with a *broken leg* isn't a real emergency?? No definitely go to your kids little league game, not like they have hundreds of those & your sister with a *broken leg* should manage just fine.. ordering Uber eats and having it sit at your front door for hours is for sure what sister should have done. \n\nOP, YTA.", "Why you don't retire in the US.\n\nNot to mention, how do kids help this situation?", "Kids have sports games like every second.

OP stated that she still makes time to spend time with her sister, and she clearly helped her sister after surgery, but also confirmed that the sister only helps her with things outside of the kids if \"she doesn't have something else going on\" and doesn't help with anything kid related at all, but frequently throws the \"we're family, you owe me\" argument in her face while being unwilling to reciprocate.\n\n\nSo, if you are arguing that OP should be doing more for her sister because she's family, is the sister not at least as obligated to OP?
