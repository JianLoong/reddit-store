Being a parent is not for everyone and no one should be obligated to have a kid if they don\u2019t want one, but, what you said is completely true. If no one had children, there would not be doctors, bus drivers, grocery store clerks, hairdressers, farmers, and on and on. Your sister seems a bit self-absorbed to not be able to accept that the world does not revolve around her and her needs.", "NTA. People are 100% entitled to living a child-free lifestyle. Most people who don\u2019t want kids really shouldn\u2019t have kids anyways. However, not wanting kids does not equal everyone around you putting their kids second to your needs. \n\nYour sister is an adult. If she doesn\u2019t want to deal with adults with young children she\u2019s more than capable of finding child-free friends who can do spontaneous things with her. And you\u2019re not wrong, if no one had anymore kids she would get 0 help in her 80s and 90s", "NTA. She's not talking about kids in the abstract. She's talking about specific family members and treating them as a nuisance which deserves the response you gave her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t shame her for not having kids, you pointed out her shitty attitude about kids in general. She the one complaining about people who made a different choice than her. It\u2019s fine she doesn\u2019t want kids, but she can\u2019t then complain about people she chooses to have in her life who do have kids. Why isn\u2019t she out there trying to find new friends who are also child free?", "Nta. Being childfree is a valid choice. However your sister is selfish expecting everyone to basically abandon their kids for her convenience. She demands respect for being \"childfree by choice\" yet doesn't proffer respect to those who parent by choice. She is a hypocrite. I also wonder if there is some sourgrapes going on. Is she truly childfree by choice or maybe no one wanted to procreate with her because she is such an A h.", "It\u2019s one thing not to like kids. A a whole other thing to not like other people having kids. That\u2019s so unreasonable. It would be like if you complained that she should have had kids so that yours could have play dates", "I had the same problem with a child free friend. She got increasingly angry that I had to spend time with my child. I'm all about babysitters too. So it wasn't like we didn't have opportunities to hang out says kids. In the end she wrote me a ten page letter detailing how disappointed she was with me. I told her, it's clear you need to find friends with as much free time as you have. OP's sister needs to find child free friends and build her own supportive friend group. NTA", "NTA. A little rude but her mindset was pretty rude too.", "YTA. Childfree people cannot express any frustration over their families and friends putting them dead last on their list of priorities because it always ends up with a parent going on a rant how noble of a choice becoming a parent is.", "NTA\n\nWhat do you have to apologize for? She is so entitled she wishes you didn't have kids so that you can wait on her hand and foot instead!", "NTA\n\nThis was very entitled of your sister to ask you (or anyone) to prioritize her, instead of the kids. Your kids are your responsibility, she isn't.\n\nI think your sister's barking up the wrong tree when she's upset that you can't satisfy her social needs to the detriment of your children. While you can make plans to be together, it's a given that you need to work around your children's schedule, duh! She needs to make some child free friends, if she wants people who can just drop everything to be there for her.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds entitled and immature and the type of person who blames everyone for their unhappiness. She had it coming. And I'm childfree too.", "NTA - decision acceptance goes both ways.youve accepted her choice and haven't, I assume, shiver it I her face every chance you get. Whereas she isn't accepting of your decision because of the constant sneer or jab at you for having kids. \n\nYou can't up and leave for a trip because your sister wants you too. She must understand that you have responsibilities that come first. Otherwise she needs to make friends with child free people. \n\nMy sister is child free. We don't go at each other about our choices. I don't bombard her with things about my kid. I only tell if she asks or I tell her when it's an emergency. \n\nLike I said acceptance goes both ways.", ">Ugh I can't wait till everyone's kids are grown and we can just do stuff again.\n\n\nwhy did this strike a nerve its literally a thought that all parents get eventually.\n\nESH", "NTA. Having a child makes me sympathize with other parents. I don't be an asshole trying to get them to calm their kid loudly in restaurant or when they act out in a movie. Sometimes I can't have plans with friends or family because my little one has gymnastics or we're going out for father daughter time  It's perfectly natural. If anything, non-parents only have a right to complain when the parents do NOTHING to help calm down their child or when the parent seems completely neglectful of the child's needs. Your sister doesn't seem like the type of person to care. Hope she has a plan when the kids in the family grow up and no one wants to take care of her grumpy @$$.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is behaving like a child.", "ESH. Your sister sounds exhausting. I get her frustration that no one seems to put her first or be interested in helping her. She has stated her feelings multiple times on this issue though. Everyone knows how she feels. There\u2019s no need for her to go on at every opportunity. \n\nBut you also don\u2019t need to snap back in the way that you did. I mean, when your sister was incapacitated you could have called around for your kid to carpool to sport so she could be helped when the person she paid to help her was unavailable. It seems like she has made as much of an effort as possible not to rely on family in recognition of the fact she\u2019s not willing to help with kids. I feel like that complaint is a valid one.", "NTA.\n\nyou said the truth, the whole truth and nothing but te truth.", "YTA your sister was venting once and you made it personal.

Circle of life.", "ESH", "I was going to N A H, but after some reflection, YTA\n\nWhat she said wasn't wrong and what you said is kind of a moot point. It isn't your sister's job to populate an already overpopulated world, and that has nothing to do with her frustration over trying to get help when she needs it because of choices *others* have made.\n\n It is really limiting to be childfree in your 30s/40s.  I'm CF and 34 and it limits my social opportunities a lot. It sucks to have friends and family constantly flaking out on you.  It's hard to make new friends. \n\nI broke my leg a few years back. I had no help whatsoever. I had to take an Uber to and from the hospital. I have learned that I can't rely on anyone. I had to cook, buy groceries, drive myself to work, and make my way through snowy, unshoveled streets by myself. I am proud of my self-reliance, but you aren't realizing the kind of privileges you have. \n\nYou really should try to put yourself in your sister's shoes.\n\nAnd no, her decision not to have kids and still wanting help from others has nothing to do with not babysitting your kids because SHE'S CHILDFREE.  She made the choice to not have kids and not be around kids, and that does not mean she has to babysit yours, or that she can't be upset when her hired help cancels when she's broken a limb and can't walk.", "NTA- these people bother me. I've also chosen the no kid life for myself but that doesn't mean I expect my friends to drop everything and come when I call. I'm happy for them and see them when we can get together. Or do family friendly things", "Nta you didn\u2019t lie.", "Info:  is your sister physically able to have children?  Some people are child free due to inability to conceive and if this were the case, your comment was likely hurtful.", "NTA.

Sounds like you hate her.", "NTA truth hurts sometimes but needs to be said.", "NTA, she thinks your world should revolve around her.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't shame her for being child free. You rightfully called her out when she complained that you prioritized your kids over her.", "NTA, you were frustrated and she shouldn\u2019t have said what she did. She should be grateful that she had the help she did. She needs some friends without kids.", "NTA. The only reason she is \u201cchildfree\u201d is because she is as self centered as a toddler.", "NTA. I'm also child free by choice, but if I don't wanna be shamed for not having kids, I'm not gonna shame someone else for having them.", "NTA\n\nI mean, you didn't shame her for not wanting kids. You shamed her for bellyaching that everybody else has kids. It'd be one thing if she wasn't whining that everyone else has their own pursuits and raising families, but she is actively griping all the same.", "NTA when your kids are grown you will also be hanging out with them. You guys get to do way more fun stuff together. Yes the kids will be more independent and want to hang with friends but it\u2019s not like you will always be free to hang later on. You and your husband might not want a third wheel around all the time when the time comes. Nothing to apologize for you made your choices and she made hers.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't shame her for not having kids. It sounds like she is trying to shame her friends and family that do have kids.", "NTA.\n\nIt's one thing to not want kids for yourself. You've been very respectful and supportive of her personal decision to remain childfree.\n\nIt's another thing entirely to whine and moan about how much you dislike other people's decisions to become parents, and you just can't wait until their kids grow up and everyone can be normal again.\n\nWhat an immature little twit. I can't believe she is so disrespectful to you, and you are so used to it that you worry YOU have been an A when you finally comment back against one of her rude little rants. \\[Actually, I can believe it, one of my siblings is also an immature and self centered twit :)\\] You are lovely and kind dear.", "NTA, you were right. Besides, she is not the world's priority that she wants to be. Let her cool off, she could use the time-out to think about her selfish behavior \ud83d\ude0f", "NTA\n\nShe was whining, you got frustrated. You weren\u2019t shaming her for not having kids, you were calling her out on shaming other people for having them. I don\u2019t think your response rises to AH levels. She\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA she was acting ungrateful and whiny when she was lucky she had people trying so hard to help her at all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her choosing to not have kids, but her dislike of kids seems to come from her resenting that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, and that mindset deserves to be called out.", "NTA you would have thought her being laid up with no one to care for her but family would have given her newfound appreciation for some of the benefits family (including children) can have as we age.  We have children but my BIL doesn\u2019t and I always worry about what will happen to him as he gets older, since we live in another country. If he ever needs help he\u2019s screwed. Who will come round and make sure he didn\u2019t fall? Who will check that he hasn\u2019t started to lose his marbles? Who will visit him in the home he will inevitably end up in? I\u2019m worried for everyone as a society as a generation comes up where most won\u2019t have children who will care about them when they\u2019re 80. It\u2019s definitely not a reason to have kids (for sure) but perhaps one of its benefits.", "tbh I get it because all my friends have kids and while I love being auntie, it\u2019s a bit lonely not having anyone to do last minute frivolous things with, and it\u2019s nerve wracking to do it solo. but that\u2019s not something I throw in my friends\u2019 faces, omg. she could benefit from a therapist. NTA", "One of my asshole friends like this is so selfish, never married etc. Fine never being married or having kids but when they want slam others who do that is wrong. My kids are grown now and I am dealing with elderly parents and that annoys my friend. She does not help with her parents so my doing so bugs her. She is all about herself.", "Your sister is entitled not to have kids. She is not entitled to expect everyone can drop their lives to run around after her. \n\nYou have nothing to apologise for, NTA", "NTA You didn't shame her for having kids. She's shaming others for having them. She sounds insanely selfish. It's wild to me she expects you all to help her but is never able to help with your kids. She doesn't have to have kids but she has no right to complain that other's are having them.", "NTA. As a single woman with no kids, this kind of attitude grinds my gears. Your sister is entitled to live her life how she wants, but it\u2019s unfair to expect people who have families and associated commitments to just make themselves available at the drop of a hat.", "NTA. You didn't shame her for not having kids. You reminded her the world does not revolve around her, and that the natural consequence of her life is she needs to plan for care because there won't be anyone to help take care of her.", "I apologized to her because it was very clear that I upset her. She doesn't usually just up and leave like that.", "Same here on the struggling to understand!", "Especially because the sister is an adult. She doesn\u2019t need constant care. Kids do. That\u2019s how it works.", "I do understand some people's frustration about having kids and the impact it has on interacting with other adults, but I suppose it's more there's a limit to it? Especially when, since she does not want to help with the kids at all, she's taking herself out of the helping pool when I need it, and that's fine, but don't turn around and consistently complain that I or someone else she knows isn't dropping everything to help her with whatever she needs if that makes sense.", ">But please bear in mind that child-free folk do often get the worse deal.\n\nHaving lived as an adult without children for over a decade and with one for five years, this is the funniest line I've seen all week.", "I mean, parents kind of *have* to prioritize their kids first\u2026If not they\u2019ll get taken away.", "Lol, what, should people just ignore their kids, the people they chose to have and are responsible for, because someone feels left out? It\u2019s fine if someone is child free, but of course they will come after a person\u2019s kids in the list of priorities. They\u2019re adults! Kids aren\u2019t. And parents have an obligation to their kids, not to other family or friends.", "Are we just ignoring the entitlement of the sister here?  I'm childfree but would never talk to my sister that way for prioritizing her family. I wouldn't expect anything more from my other sibling without children than I would from the one who has them. We're adults and being an adult means figuring your own shit out, not pouting because someone's child was (rightfully) prioritized especially when we're living in a time of DoorDash and Instacart. Sooo sorry she had to wait for her Doritos while her sibling was investing her kid's life.", "Yeah and how much the childless person is selfish for not producing offspring. \n\nYTA, op.", "Getting that thought once, yes. Getting it multiple times and for her to complain about not getting help or hanging out with her on a whim because we have kids, while we respect her boundaries of her not helping with or doing anything involving the kids. Yes, it is extremely frustrating to have unlimited availability expected of you but don't receive it in turn.", "Because OP is doing stuff, living the family life and her sister is being shitty about it.", "Because kids aren't some hardship to work through if they are wanted. Children grow up but they are still sons and daughters and super important in their parents lives. Don't treat other people's life choices as a personal inconvenience to your whims.", ">you could have called around for your kid to carpool to sport\n\nGetting our son to his game wasn't the issue, the issue would then be that only one of our kids had one of us at their game, while the other didn't. That's not fair to our kids.", "yeah, op not helping her sister with a broken leg because her kid had a sports game kind of sucked.", "> What she said wasn't wrong and what you said is kind of a moot point. \n\nI would agree \u2026 except it is fairly obvious that her point was passive aggressive, and it is relevant that this woman is complaining about not getting what she needs when she needs it because of people having kids\u2026 when OP is correct that other people\u2019s kids will eventually be the reason she gets what she needs, because she didn\u2019t have any of her own. \n\n> It isn't your sister's job to populate an already overpopulated world, \n\nOP did not say or even remotely imply this *at all.* like\u2026 *at all.*\n\n> and that has nothing to do with her frustration over trying to get help when she needs it because of choices others have made.\n\nNo no\u2026 no\u2026 because of the choices *she* has made, and/or the circumstances life has dealt her. And they are VALID choices, before you jump down my throat, but it\u2019s no one *else\u2019s* fault she doesn\u2019t have someone besides siblings to help her out immediately in this situation. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she deserves it; I\u2019m saying that\u2019s just \u2026 life. \n\nIt is not other people\u2019s responsibility to come to her immediate aid, and her family DID come to her aid as soon as they actually could. \n\n> It is really limiting to be childfree in your 30s/40s.  I'm CF and 34 and it limits my social opportunities a lot. It sucks to have friends and family constantly flaking out on you.  It's hard to make new friends.\n\nIt\u2019s also very freeing. And if you\u2019re child free by choice\u2026 those are the limitations you chose. Those who have kids, like OP, are limited by the obligations that come with having kids. Which are rather significant, and which they also chose.\n\n> I broke my leg a few years back. I had no help whatsoever. I had to take an Uber to and from the hospital. \n\nSame. And I would expect nothing else as a child free single adult living alone if my family were busy. Of course it is difficult. It\u2019s okay to be upset. But to insinuate that it\u2019s due to other people\u2019s choices is audacious as hell. OP came to help when they could.\n\n> I have learned that I can't rely on anyone. I had to cook, buy groceries, drive myself to work, and make my way through snowy, unshoveled streets by myself. \n\nLmao\u2026 yes\u2026. and? This is the life is a single, child-free adult. And also extremely not difficult. Did you honest to Jesus just mention *cooking,* and *buying groceries,* and *driving yourself to work,* and *shovelling* as the things making your life difficult? Millions of single adults from 18-80 do this by themselves all the time. Daily. \n\nAnd married people with kids have to do this twice as much\u2026 because they have kids. They have to do *more,* not *less.* They don\u2019t just have to drive themselves to work, they have to drive their kids all over the place as well. They have to buy groceries for their entire family, cook for their entire family. \n\nAnd yes that\u2019s their choice\u2026.  just as much as this woman\u2019s decision to be child free is a choice.\n\nIs it much more difficult with a broken leg? Absolutely. Is that anyone else\u2019s responsibility? No. Is it easier when you have kids? Not necessarily. In fact, it can be even harder if you have young kids you also have to take care of on top of having a broken leg and getting *yourself* taken care of. \n\n> I am proud of my self-reliance\n\nThen\u2026 be proud? Also, this is basic adulting. I was proud of this level of self-reliance when I was 18 years old. By all means be proud. That\u2019s fantastic. More people should be proud of their everyday accomplishments. \n\nExcept it rings a little empty when you\u2019re going to follow it up with a complaint.\n\n> but you aren't realizing the kind of privileges you have.\n\n\u2026. Says who? What part of OP\u2019s comment suggested they don\u2019t realize the privilege of having a family of their own?\n\nThey just didn\u2019t appreciate OP\u2019s blatant resentment.\n\n> You really should try to put yourself in your sister's shoes.\n\nOP has empathy. OP went over to help when they could. Sure sister is probably frustrated and suffering, but I\u2019ve been there too, and I do not resent my family one bit for telling me to tone it the fuck down because my situation, while frustrating, is not their fault.\n\n> And no, her decision not to have kids and still wanting help from others has nothing to do with not babysitting your kids because SHE'S CHILDFREE.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s her decision. And it\u2019s valid.

I have been a childfree adult for close to ten years and I\u2019d never in a million years say that I have the \u201cworse deal\u201d compared to my friends who are parents.", "Sounds like he thinks the world should revolve around him", "You\u2019re ignoring the fact that OP went to her sister\u2019s house as soon as she could. I\u2019ve been injured (badly sprained ankles that included torn muscles) where mobility was an issue, but I never got mad if someone had a prior commitment and couldn\u2019t help me right away.", "Ice cream for breakfast. They'll love you forever & it's a dairy just like yogurt. \ud83e\udd23", "I love you. And I hope your friends appreciate you!!", "If I could figure a way to explain it without it coming across as complaining that she doesn't babysit or help with anything regarding the kids (ie, picking them up when we're running late, picking something up from the store for their parties)  I would. I respect that she wants to maintain being childfree and doesn't want to babysit or help with anything, it's not her responsibility and I don't hold it against her.", "I think this is one of those situations where it's difficult for one side or the other to claim having it harder. Obviously for child less people you're going to notice every time that people are rude to you or there are disadvantages to having no children. But we as parents are going to notice every time we are treated rudely or excluded or so on for having children or being parents. I don't think intentionally childless people have it harder...until old age. Phew, there were some very dark situations I saw as a caregiver, and the *only* exceptions were people with deeply loving families, only one of those being the case if a childless person with a very caring sibling. Having kids isn't a guarantee of a good old age, but it sure seemed like it really helped the odds.", "**Some.** But kids will always be a parent\u2019s priority. Grown adults need help less often than a child does. That\u2019s simply how it is. \n\nThis strikes me as an example of when child free people somehow forget they were kids once too, kids who should\u2019ve been their parents\u2019 priority and hopefully was. How would you have felt as a kid if you have something going on but your parents dropped their plans with you because someone else, an adult no less, wanted something? I mean, we do hear stories of this happening and it screws people up. \n\nBe child free all you want. But accept that children will always be #1 for their parents. That\u2019s life.", "One of us already has to miss games sometimes, and in spring, its very rare that one of them will have both parents at a game. I think it's a big gamble and frankly wrong to  miss an event important to them just to teach them a lesson that can be taught in other ways, at other times, as that can also teach them that they matter less and build resentment.", "Is it fine, though?", "Exactly. When someone gets married, that spouse becomes their immediate family, and their parents and siblings become extended family. Same when someone has a kid.", "Society pays for children because everyone begins their life as a child.", "But that\u2019s reality. Everyone is born and goes through childhood. Everyone is someone\u2019s child. And if the sister wants there to be good people to help her in her life at any point, she has to accept that means kids need to be raised in a good family, which means parents focus on the kids. That\u2019s just how it has always worked.", "Not having kids regardless of her disposition doesn't mean she has no responsibilities, mind you"]}
