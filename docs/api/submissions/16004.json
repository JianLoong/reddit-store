Being a parent is not for everyone and no one should be obligated to have a kid if they don\u2019t want one, but, what you said is completely true. If no one had children, there would not be doctors, bus drivers, grocery store clerks, hairdressers, farmers, and on and on. Your sister seems a bit self-absorbed to not be able to accept that the world does not revolve around her and her needs.", "NTA. People are 100% entitled to living a child-free lifestyle. Most people who don\u2019t want kids really shouldn\u2019t have kids anyways. However, not wanting kids does not equal everyone around you putting their kids second to your needs. \n\nYour sister is an adult. If she doesn\u2019t want to deal with adults with young children she\u2019s more than capable of finding child-free friends who can do spontaneous things with her. And you\u2019re not wrong, if no one had anymore kids she would get 0 help in her 80s and 90s", "NTA. She's not talking about kids in the abstract. She's talking about specific family members and treating them as a nuisance which deserves the response you gave her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t shame her for not having kids, you pointed out her shitty attitude about kids in general. She the one complaining about people who made a different choice than her. It\u2019s fine she doesn\u2019t want kids, but she can\u2019t then complain about people she chooses to have in her life who do have kids. Why isn\u2019t she out there trying to find new friends who are also child free?", "Nta. Being childfree is a valid choice. However your sister is selfish expecting everyone to basically abandon their kids for her convenience. She demands respect for being \"childfree by choice\" yet doesn't proffer respect to those who parent by choice. She is a hypocrite. I also wonder if there is some sourgrapes going on. Is she truly childfree by choice or maybe no one wanted to procreate with her because she is such an A h.", "It\u2019s one thing not to like kids. A a whole other thing to not like other people having kids. That\u2019s so unreasonable. It would be like if you complained that she should have had kids so that yours could have play dates", "I had the same problem with a child free friend. She got increasingly angry that I had to spend time with my child. I'm all about babysitters too. So it wasn't like we didn't have opportunities to hang out says kids. In the end she wrote me a ten page letter detailing how disappointed she was with me. I told her, it's clear you need to find friends with as much free time as you have. OP's sister needs to find child free friends and build her own supportive friend group. NTA", "NTA. A little rude but her mindset was pretty rude too.", "YTA. Childfree people cannot express any frustration over their families and friends putting them dead last on their list of priorities because it always ends up with a parent going on a rant how noble of a choice becoming a parent is.", "NTA\n\nWhat do you have to apologize for? She is so entitled she wishes you didn't have kids so that you can wait on her hand and foot instead!", "NTA\n\nThis was very entitled of your sister to ask you (or anyone) to prioritize her, instead of the kids. Your kids are your responsibility, she isn't.\n\nI think your sister's barking up the wrong tree when she's upset that you can't satisfy her social needs to the detriment of your children. While you can make plans to be together, it's a given that you need to work around your children's schedule, duh! She needs to make some child free friends, if she wants people who can just drop everything to be there for her.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds entitled and immature and the type of person who blames everyone for their unhappiness. She had it coming. And I'm childfree too.", "NTA - decision acceptance goes both ways.youve accepted her choice and haven't, I assume, shiver it I her face every chance you get. Whereas she isn't accepting of your decision because of the constant sneer or jab at you for having kids. \n\nYou can't up and leave for a trip because your sister wants you too. She must understand that you have responsibilities that come first. Otherwise she needs to make friends with child free people. \n\nMy sister is child free. We don't go at each other about our choices. I don't bombard her with things about my kid. I only tell if she asks or I tell her when it's an emergency. \n\nLike I said acceptance goes both ways.", ">Ugh I can't wait till everyone's kids are grown and we can just do stuff again.\n\n\nwhy did this strike a nerve its literally a thought that all parents get eventually.\n\nESH", "NTA. Having a child makes me sympathize with other parents. I don't be an asshole trying to get them to calm their kid loudly in restaurant or when they act out in a movie. Sometimes I can't have plans with friends or family because my little one has gymnastics or we're going out for father daughter time  It's perfectly natural. If anything, non-parents only have a right to complain when the parents do NOTHING to help calm down their child or when the parent seems completely neglectful of the child's needs. Your sister doesn't seem like the type of person to care. Hope she has a plan when the kids in the family grow up and no one wants to take care of her grumpy @$$.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is behaving like a child.", "ESH. Your sister sounds exhausting. I get her frustration that no one seems to put her first or be interested in helping her. She has stated her feelings multiple times on this issue though. Everyone knows how she feels. There\u2019s no need for her to go on at every opportunity. \n\nBut you also don\u2019t need to snap back in the way that you did. I mean, when your sister was incapacitated you could have called around for your kid to carpool to sport so she could be helped when the person she paid to help her was unavailable. It seems like she has made as much of an effort as possible not to rely on family in recognition of the fact she\u2019s not willing to help with kids. I feel like that complaint is a valid one.", "NTA.\n\nyou said the truth, the whole truth and nothing but te truth.", "YTA your sister was venting once and you made it personal.

Circle of life.", "ESH", "I was going to N A H, but after some reflection, YTA\n\nWhat she said wasn't wrong and what you said is kind of a moot point. It isn't your sister's job to populate an already overpopulated world, and that has nothing to do with her frustration over trying to get help when she needs it because of choices *others* have made.\n\n It is really limiting to be childfree in your 30s/40s.  I'm CF and 34 and it limits my social opportunities a lot. It sucks to have friends and family constantly flaking out on you.  It's hard to make new friends. \n\nI broke my leg a few years back. I had no help whatsoever. I had to take an Uber to and from the hospital. I have learned that I can't rely on anyone. I had to cook, buy groceries, drive myself to work, and make my way through snowy, unshoveled streets by myself. I am proud of my self-reliance, but you aren't realizing the kind of privileges you have. \n\nYou really should try to put yourself in your sister's shoes.\n\nAnd no, her decision not to have kids and still wanting help from others has nothing to do with not babysitting your kids because SHE'S CHILDFREE.  She made the choice to not have kids and not be around kids, and that does not mean she has to babysit yours, or that she can't be upset when her hired help cancels when she's broken a limb and can't walk.", "NTA- these people bother me. I've also chosen the no kid life for myself but that doesn't mean I expect my friends to drop everything and come when I call. I'm happy for them and see them when we can get together. Or do family friendly things", "Nta you didn\u2019t lie.", "Info:  is your sister physically able to have children?  Some people are child free due to inability to conceive and if this were the case, your comment was likely hurtful.", "NTA.

Sounds like you hate her.", "NTA truth hurts sometimes but needs to be said.", "NTA, she thinks your world should revolve around her.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't shame her for being child free. You rightfully called her out when she complained that you prioritized your kids over her.", "NTA, you were frustrated and she shouldn\u2019t have said what she did. She should be grateful that she had the help she did. She needs some friends without kids.", "NTA. The only reason she is \u201cchildfree\u201d is because she is as self centered as a toddler.", "NTA. I'm also child free by choice, but if I don't wanna be shamed for not having kids, I'm not gonna shame someone else for having them.", "NTA\n\nI mean, you didn't shame her for not wanting kids. You shamed her for bellyaching that everybody else has kids. It'd be one thing if she wasn't whining that everyone else has their own pursuits and raising families, but she is actively griping all the same.", "NTA when your kids are grown you will also be hanging out with them. You guys get to do way more fun stuff together. Yes the kids will be more independent and want to hang with friends but it\u2019s not like you will always be free to hang later on. You and your husband might not want a third wheel around all the time when the time comes. Nothing to apologize for you made your choices and she made hers.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't shame her for not having kids. It sounds like she is trying to shame her friends and family that do have kids.", "NTA.\n\nIt's one thing to not want kids for yourself. You've been very respectful and supportive of her personal decision to remain childfree.\n\nIt's another thing entirely to whine and moan about how much you dislike other people's decisions to become parents, and you just can't wait until their kids grow up and everyone can be normal again.\n\nWhat an immature little twit. I can't believe she is so disrespectful to you, and you are so used to it that you worry YOU have been an A when you finally comment back against one of her rude little rants. \\[Actually, I can believe it, one of my siblings is also an immature and self centered twit :)\\] You are lovely and kind dear.", "NTA, you were right. Besides, she is not the world's priority that she wants to be. Let her cool off, she could use the time-out to think about her selfish behavior \ud83d\ude0f", "NTA\n\nShe was whining, you got frustrated. You weren\u2019t shaming her for not having kids, you were calling her out on shaming other people for having them. I don\u2019t think your response rises to AH levels. She\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA she was acting ungrateful and whiny when she was lucky she had people trying so hard to help her at all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her choosing to not have kids, but her dislike of kids seems to come from her resenting that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, and that mindset deserves to be called out.", "NTA you would have thought her being laid up with no one to care for her but family would have given her newfound appreciation for some of the benefits family (including children) can have as we age.  We have children but my BIL doesn\u2019t and I always worry about what will happen to him as he gets older, since we live in another country. If he ever needs help he\u2019s screwed. Who will come round and make sure he didn\u2019t fall? Who will check that he hasn\u2019t started to lose his marbles? Who will visit him in the home he will inevitably end up in? I\u2019m worried for everyone as a society as a generation comes up where most won\u2019t have children who will care about them when they\u2019re 80. It\u2019s definitely not a reason to have kids (for sure) but perhaps one of its benefits.", "tbh I get it because all my friends have kids and while I love being auntie, it\u2019s a bit lonely not having anyone to do last minute frivolous things with, and it\u2019s nerve wracking to do it solo. but that\u2019s not something I throw in my friends\u2019 faces, omg. she could benefit from a therapist. NTA", "One of my asshole friends like this is so selfish, never married etc. Fine never being married or having kids but when they want slam others who do that is wrong. My kids are grown now and I am dealing with elderly parents and that annoys my friend. She does not help with her parents so my doing so bugs her. She is all about herself.", "Your sister is entitled not to have kids. She is not entitled to expect everyone can drop their lives to run around after her. \n\nYou have nothing to apologise for, NTA", "NTA You didn't shame her for having kids. She's shaming others for having them. She sounds insanely selfish. It's wild to me she expects you all to help her but is never able to help with your kids. She doesn't have to have kids but she has no right to complain that other's are having them.", "NTA. As a single woman with no kids, this kind of attitude grinds my gears. Your sister is entitled to live her life how she wants, but it\u2019s unfair to expect people who have families and associated commitments to just make themselves available at the drop of a hat.", "NTA. You didn't shame her for not having kids. You reminded her the world does not revolve around her, and that the natural consequence of her life is she needs to plan for care because there won't be anyone to help take care of her.", "I apologized to her because it was very clear that I upset her. She doesn't usually just up and leave like that.", "Same here on the struggling to understand!", "Especially because the sister is an adult. She doesn\u2019t need constant care. Kids do. That\u2019s how it works.", "I do understand some people's frustration about having kids and the impact it has on interacting with other adults, but I suppose it's more there's a limit to it? Especially when, since she does not want to help with the kids at all, she's taking herself out of the helping pool when I need it, and that's fine, but don't turn around and consistently complain that I or someone else she knows isn't dropping everything to help her with whatever she needs if that makes sense.", ">But please bear in mind that child-free folk do often get the worse deal.\n\nHaving lived as an adult without children for over a decade and with one for five years, this is the funniest line I've seen all week.", "I mean, parents kind of *have* to prioritize their kids first\u2026If not they\u2019ll get taken away.", "Lol, what, should people just ignore their kids, the people they chose to have and are responsible for, because someone feels left out? It\u2019s fine if someone is child free, but of course they will come after a person\u2019s kids in the list of priorities. They\u2019re adults! Kids aren\u2019t. And parents have an obligation to their kids, not to other family or friends.", "Are we just ignoring the entitlement of the sister here?  I'm childfree but would never talk to my sister that way for prioritizing her family. I wouldn't expect anything more from my other sibling without children than I would from the one who has them. We're adults and being an adult means figuring your own shit out, not pouting because someone's child was (rightfully) prioritized especially when we're living in a time of DoorDash and Instacart. Sooo sorry she had to wait for her Doritos while her sibling was investing her kid's life.", "Yeah and how much the childless person is selfish for not producing offspring. \n\nYTA, op.", "Getting that thought once, yes. Getting it multiple times and for her to complain about not getting help or hanging out with her on a whim because we have kids, while we respect her boundaries of her not helping with or doing anything involving the kids. Yes, it is extremely frustrating to have unlimited availability expected of you but don't receive it in turn.", "Because OP is doing stuff, living the family life and her sister is being shitty about it.", "Because kids aren't some hardship to work through if they are wanted. Children grow up but they are still sons and daughters and super important in their parents lives. Don't treat other people's life choices as a personal inconvenience to your whims.", ">you could have called around for your kid to carpool to sport\n\nGetting our son to his game wasn't the issue, the issue would then be that only one of our kids had one of us at their game, while the other didn't. That's not fair to our kids.", "yeah, op not helping her sister with a broken leg because her kid had a sports game kind of sucked.", "> What she said wasn't wrong and what you said is kind of a moot point. \n\nI would agree \u2026 except it is fairly obvious that her point was passive aggressive, and it is relevant that this woman is complaining about not getting what she needs when she needs it because of people having kids\u2026 when OP is correct that other people\u2019s kids will eventually be the reason she gets what she needs, because she didn\u2019t have any of her own. \n\n> It isn't your sister's job to populate an already overpopulated world, \n\nOP did not say or even remotely imply this *at all.* like\u2026 *at all.*\n\n> and that has nothing to do with her frustration over trying to get help when she needs it because of choices others have made.\n\nNo no\u2026 no\u2026 because of the choices *she* has made, and/or the circumstances life has dealt her. And they are VALID choices, before you jump down my throat, but it\u2019s no one *else\u2019s* fault she doesn\u2019t have someone besides siblings to help her out immediately in this situation. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she deserves it; I\u2019m saying that\u2019s just \u2026 life. \n\nIt is not other people\u2019s responsibility to come to her immediate aid, and her family DID come to her aid as soon as they actually could. \n\n> It is really limiting to be childfree in your 30s/40s.  I'm CF and 34 and it limits my social opportunities a lot. It sucks to have friends and family constantly flaking out on you.  It's hard to make new friends.\n\nIt\u2019s also very freeing. And if you\u2019re child free by choice\u2026 those are the limitations you chose. Those who have kids, like OP, are limited by the obligations that come with having kids. Which are rather significant, and which they also chose.\n\n> I broke my leg a few years back. I had no help whatsoever. I had to take an Uber to and from the hospital. \n\nSame. And I would expect nothing else as a child free single adult living alone if my family were busy. Of course it is difficult. It\u2019s okay to be upset. But to insinuate that it\u2019s due to other people\u2019s choices is audacious as hell. OP came to help when they could.\n\n> I have learned that I can't rely on anyone. I had to cook, buy groceries, drive myself to work, and make my way through snowy, unshoveled streets by myself. \n\nLmao\u2026 yes\u2026. and? This is the life is a single, child-free adult. And also extremely not difficult. Did you honest to Jesus just mention *cooking,* and *buying groceries,* and *driving yourself to work,* and *shovelling* as the things making your life difficult? Millions of single adults from 18-80 do this by themselves all the time. Daily. \n\nAnd married people with kids have to do this twice as much\u2026 because they have kids. They have to do *more,* not *less.* They don\u2019t just have to drive themselves to work, they have to drive their kids all over the place as well. They have to buy groceries for their entire family, cook for their entire family. \n\nAnd yes that\u2019s their choice\u2026.  just as much as this woman\u2019s decision to be child free is a choice.\n\nIs it much more difficult with a broken leg? Absolutely. Is that anyone else\u2019s responsibility? No. Is it easier when you have kids? Not necessarily. In fact, it can be even harder if you have young kids you also have to take care of on top of having a broken leg and getting *yourself* taken care of. \n\n> I am proud of my self-reliance\n\nThen\u2026 be proud? Also, this is basic adulting. I was proud of this level of self-reliance when I was 18 years old. By all means be proud. That\u2019s fantastic. More people should be proud of their everyday accomplishments. \n\nExcept it rings a little empty when you\u2019re going to follow it up with a complaint.\n\n> but you aren't realizing the kind of privileges you have.\n\n\u2026. Says who? What part of OP\u2019s comment suggested they don\u2019t realize the privilege of having a family of their own?\n\nThey just didn\u2019t appreciate OP\u2019s blatant resentment.\n\n> You really should try to put yourself in your sister's shoes.\n\nOP has empathy. OP went over to help when they could. Sure sister is probably frustrated and suffering, but I\u2019ve been there too, and I do not resent my family one bit for telling me to tone it the fuck down because my situation, while frustrating, is not their fault.\n\n> And no, her decision not to have kids and still wanting help from others has nothing to do with not babysitting your kids because SHE'S CHILDFREE.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s her decision. And it\u2019s valid. And OP would not have brought it up if she had not turned around and acted like OP owed her immediate unconditional support, when she has made it clear she isn\u2019t willing to provide it back.\n\nLittle ironic that the reason OP couldn\u2019t help her right away was because they couldn\u2019t find a babysitter for their kids last minute.. no?  Not her fault, not her responsibility, of course. \n\nBut I would be pissed off too if I were OP and my family was constantly acting like my kids are nothing but a temporary inconvenience in their life.\n\n> She made the choice to not have kids and not be around kids, \n\nCorrect. \n\n> and that does not mean she has to babysit yours, \n\nCorrect \n\n> or that she can't be upset when her hired help cancels when she's broken a limb and can't walk.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t make her *not* an asshole (not evil, but an asshole in that moment, in pain and frustrated or not) for making a thoughtless comment like that. And OP is not the asshole for being upset by it.", "As far as I'm aware she can. She was firmly in the  'no kids ever' camp in college so I don't know if she ever had inclination to check.", "\ud83d\ude06", "Your sister is being oversensitive and unfair. She clearly did get help when she needed it despite the fact that she doesn't seem willing to help in return (babysit). I imagine she gets a fair amount of flak for not having kids and that must be irritating but she should not take it on you.\n\nCalling her a narcissist based on this is ridiculous.\n\nMaybe let everyone cool down and meet for a nice chat. Her broken leg might have made her aware of her vulnerability as a childless older person and she may just be a bit oversensitive at the moment.\n\nI am not suggesting people should have kids to take care of them. That is incredibly selfish.", "In my opinion, you didn't say anything mean or that wasn't true. \n\nIt seems like she was upset because she was being rude again about your choice to have children, and you responded by explaining the basic concept of the need for maintaining the population. \n\nHer not liking what you said doesn't necessarily mean that you were in the wrong.", "That\u2019s fine, if the apology was necessary for smoothing over your relationship then whatever works for you works. Just don\u2019t feel too badly about it. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I am child free and and aunt. She started it by shaming all of you all parents first and complaining multiple times. You just matched her conversation and gave her some future perspective. She will just have to get over it and move on", "[deleted]", "So what you said was deemed shaming, but the multiple things she said aren\u2019t?  NTA", "This! Also, kids grow up and sometimes like to be with their family.... They even call their moms/dads and do lunch. Your kids growing up doesn't mean you won't want to hangout with your kids. I can't imagine how bad it will be once you have grandchildren! This is an issue in my mom's relationship with my brother, he is child free, hates her doting on her grandchildren. He wouldn't even meet my children as infants and doesn't understand why my focus is on my elementary aged children. He was also this way  about my spouse too..... Surprise, we don't have a relationship.", "It absolutely does make sense, which is why I wrote NTA and that she was acting entitled.\n\nI'm just pointing out that childless people can face quite a bit of prejudice, just in case it helps you understand her (still unwarranted!)  frustration better.", "People who don't want or particularly like kids tend to not be good at helping with them. When *you* need help, not kid-related, does she show up for you?", "Right. Gimme a break.", "And where did I say that they shouldn't?", "Omg there's prioritising your children and there's expecting your childfree friends and family to never expect anything from you. And I do think parents, outside their obligation to their kids, also have ~some~ obligation to their friends and family. If they think they do not, they usually end up really lonely after their children grow up and leave the house cause they suddenly realize they've lost all their friends throughout the years.", "OP literally didn\u2019t say that, just got sick of her sister bitching at her for her decision to have kids.", "OP didn\u2019t say that at all.\n\nThey were frustrated because they came over to do their family member a favour and got passive-aggressively shamed for it. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s also not the first time they\u2019ve heard this type of comment from this family member. \n\nThey weren\u2019t shaming her fie not producing offspring. They were shaming her for complaining about other people producing offspring and not putting her first.", "I know two women like this who are single and child less and super selfish. They really only think of themselves. One has a failed marriage and the other has never had a serious relationship. Both are cheap. They will gladly demand your time and money and do not reciprocate unless it is to be seen doing something for attention. Super opinionated too. \n\nI have some friends who do not have children and are great people. One of my friends who does not have children even told me that being around my kids confirmed her lack of desire to have children. We laugh about that. She is super generous with my kids though and understanding of how hard it is to parent.\n\nIt sounds like she is self centered and only thinks about how things impact her.", "dont be dramatic just because you can miss sometimes your free time doesnt mean that you dont love them or wanted them.\n\nits not black or white", "So you do prioritise your kids over your sister. Even in an emergency.", "Ok I think your sister is an asshole but raising kids to believe life is always fair creates assholes too. It is okay to miss a game. A friend who is a child psychologist told me one of the most important things parents need to do is teach kids to deal with disappointment. I highly recommend you miss a game sometimes and do not be those Even Steven parents. Kids parented liked that have a hard time at work etc. Teach them that life is not always fair and to do their best and be kind. My in laws made everything even. My SIL competes with my children. She is super bratty. \n\nYou do not want to raise a selfish child who ends up like your sister.\n\nSeriously blow off some games. Spend more on one kid occasionally. Love them equally let them know that sometimes one will get more time or more gifts and that it will alternate.\n\nI tell my kids I have a favorite child and it changes all the time.", "She didn't refuse to help her because of her kid's game. She did help her. Just not at the exact time her sister requested.", "Yeah I was kinda on the fence about it but decided to argue Y T A because this post will get drowned out with N T As and arguing for empathy is valid and should be defended.", "No I had kids because I wanted a family.", "Not all the time, no, and that's fine.", "Your projection in the initial comment is too transparent for you to try and carry this off as them misinterpreting you.", "\u2026. And as soon as their immediate obligation to their family was done, they went over to help their family out. It just wasn\u2019t as immediately as they would have liked. \n\nSo what exactly is your point?", "I feel like they did though, with the whole \"someone's child is taking care of you!\"\nThe sister might have been a bit of an asshole too, but comments like that are imo the bigger asshole move. And somehow they love to forget the whole society is paying for children. I don't mind that we do, but don't act like I should be \"grateful\" for someone's kids taking care of me either.", "Oh I agree the sister didn't sound nice at all. They could have just said that though, instead of making comments suggesting the sister didn't do her duty by not sprouting offspring. ESH would probably have been a better ruling.", "If it were an actual emergency we would've figured something out. Light cleaning and waiting 2 extra hours for dinner and company is not an emergency.", "In what world was this an emergency? Of course the kids are the priority.", "I mean\u2026 fair, but I would argue that OP did have empathy when they went over to support as soon as they were able. And I think it\u2019s possible to have empathy for someone and still acknowledge they acted like an asshole when they were frustrated. \n\nI feel like I wouldn\u2019t generally base my judgement on wanting to play devil\u2019s advocate.", "I'm child free at 46, and whilst I understand what she meant, I think she was an AH.\n\nJust because it's not my choice to have kids, that doesn't mean I judge people who do have them.\n\nPeople make their own decisions, and I respect that.\n\nYour sister needs to understand that it's hurtful when she makes unpleasant comments about your children.\n\nIf this is out of character for her you can ask her what's up, is she feeling isolated because so many people in her life have kids? Is she feeling that people don't make time for her?\n\nIf that's the case you can say you're sorry she's feeling lonely /isolated /etc, and maybe you can do x, y, or z together. It might be that she's feeling like she's not important in the lives of people who have children. Unfortunately she's going to learn that her relationships are going to have to evolve, as people with kids are going to put them first if they're good parents.\n\nI've felt frustrated in the past when friend's and families kids affect plans, but I've kept that to myself, because in the nicest possible way, the world doesn't revolve around me.", "Family comes in all shapes and sizes. Kids don\u2019t make one.", "Yeah but why?", "Well then there you go; she doesn't prioritize you unless it's also convenient for her and shouldn't have a reciprocal expectation.", "XDDDDD ok", "\u2026. Again\u2026. OP didn\u2019t say that or imply that\u2026 at all.\n\n> They weren\u2019t shaming her for not producing offspring.

Their first steps, their first words, helping them learn how to drive. It's a different type of fulfillment and happiness.", "Case in point.", "You can have a family without kids.", "And you can have a family with kids, what's your point?", "You can also have one with kids. Which was what OP wanted", "I imagine that one of the reasons the sister is the way she is is OP\u2019s idea that she isn\u2019t real family. Since OP\u2019s reason for having kids is that she wanted a family. She already had one.", "I doubt that, I think the sister is just jealous that OP now has a different lifestyle that doesn't conveniently line up with hers anymore. And starting a family is worlds apart from saying you already have family cuz you have siblings or parents. Families are meant to grow and survive generations, it's human nature to want that."]}
