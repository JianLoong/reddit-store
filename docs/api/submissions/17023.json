When she told me she was pregnant, I didn't much care and, strangely, she then felt the same about me. \n\nNow I have a chance to prove she's important to me on the biggest day of her life, I again choose my new family.\n\nAITA?\"\n\nYes, OP. For decades, YTA.", "INFO \n\nHow much did you put into your daughter in her early adult years? \n\nDo you ask her to go to dinner/lunch/coffee without your daughter's and wife? \n\nDo you put effort into just spending time with her?", "Why is she the one to make effort? YOU\u2019RE THE PARENT. Can\u2019t believe you\u2019re a deadbeat that\u2019s mad your daughter for your damn actions. Good riddance I hope she gets rid of you once and for all.

Is there NO ONE else on the team your daughter can ride to the competition with so you can attend the wedding?\n\nRight. I forgot.

You're one for your total lack of interest in parenting your child. You could and should have made more effort. Unless your ex absolutely refused to let you you could have been with her more than just everything other weekend. My hubby has kids from a previous marriage, we had his kids every chance we got. And he called them and spoke to them as often as he could when they WEREN'T with us. The fact you only talk to her a few times a year is very telling. She tells you she's pregnant and all you do is text her ok let me know when you get a scan. No excited phone calls? No offers of giving help or babysitting? Nothing? 3 of our kids are grown, we talk to them just about everything day and see them several times a week. Stop acting hurt she hasn't called you. Either be in her life, or don't. Your younger kid will have other meets, this will hopefully be your oldest ones only wedding. So by telling her you can't go because of a not as important event that there will be more of, you're telling her who is more important to you. She got the message, that's why she hasn't called you.", "YTA \n\nSounds like you\u2019ve neglected your oldest daughter ever since having her 1/2 siblings. Idk if it\u2019s anger or acceptance of what you are, but you\u2019ve repeatedly let her down most of her life it sounds like.", "YTA. A wedding and christening is far more important than a gymnastics competition unless it was literally the Olympics. You are estranged because you chose your new family over your daughter and you are proving it again.", "YTA, and not only for the wedding. You are the parent, it is your job to keep in contact with your daughter, and make sure every step of the way, that she means just as much to you, as the younger ones. Your daughter tells you, that you are going to be a grandfather, and you answer \"ok\"? Why are you not over the moon?  And then you wait from August until December to reach out to her again? 4 months? And then you wait until March to reach out again, when you know your daughter is pregnant? What in Gods name is wrong with you?\n\nAnd after not caring about your pregnant daughter for her entire pregnancny, you are now telling her that you wont be attending her wedding, because you would rather go to a gymnastic competition.\n\nYTA - and a dead-beat dad. Your daughter isn't mad, she is deeply hurt, that you over and over and over are telling her she doesn't matter.", "NAH. For all intents and purposes, the two of you no longer have a relationship. There are a million and one reasons for why that may be, and it\u2019s likely a shared responsibility between both you and your daughter\u2014you both seem willing to try sometimes and completely ambivalent other times. (The bigger responsibility is with you as the father, of course.) What\u2019s done is done. You may not have succeeded at being a good father to your oldest daughter, but you seem to be doing it with your younger daughters\u2014good for you.\n\nYes, it probably would have been nice to say yes and go to the wedding, and you could even explain to your younger daughter why\u2014they can understand a lot more than you think. And yes, even adult children want their parents and their approval, even if they haven\u2019t been a part of her life. But part of me also thinks that you\u2019re imagining her being upset\u2014she could just be ambivalent like she\u2019s seemingly been before.", "YTA \n\nYou want to be there. She reached out and you won\u2019t be there. You texted her you won\u2019t be at her wedding - how are you not the AH??", "INFO: how often do you initiate contact with your hopefully ex daughter? Are you aware and okay with missing the wedding and destroying this relationship forever? Cause I can tell you that you\u2019ve been treading on thin ice for awhile. The fact that you\u2019ve reached this stage of her not giving you updates anymore means she\u2019s already fed up enough because you don\u2019t take an interest in her life.", "This is mind blowing for me. Dude had a grandchild and didn\u2019t even made an effort to visit him, just called and got offended that she didn\u2019t call herself", "Also op would have been 50 when he got his new wife pregnant and given the 5 year gap between kids it's highly unlikely his new wife is close to his age... I'm willing to get that plays a huge part in all this", "Yeah, he really succeeded in replacing his family. He\u2019ll never hear from her again.", "I wonder if her not responding was actually anger, or just acceptance and can't be bothered to respond. At that point inviting OP might of just been done as a polite guesture.\n\nObv. I don't know OP's daughter or her views on OP, but if i was her position I would HATE OP and consider him a deadbeat dad.  I'm kinda petty and I probably would of only invited OP if pressured into it. Hell, I'd probably be happy OP declined, that means I could move on and have less drama at my wedding etc. That means I'd save a placing for a person I don't want at my wedding and I can invite other people that have actually made an effort to be in my life.\n\nFrom his post it seems OP hasn't even made an effort to see their own grandkid. Even the contact frequency is horrible, august she called him, december he called (didn't get through and left it like that), march (called her mom). April ( sent a bday text-not even a call)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I didn't talk to my parents for an entire month, they'd probably send someone to hunt me down and make sure I'm okay.", "THIS comment here!", "My bio dad was like that.

OP you\u2019re a crappy parent and I\u2019ll disagree with some Redditors who urge you to attend the wedding.  Do NOT  go.  You\u2019ll just disappoint her again.  Leave your oldest alone.", "No no OP does want be in his daughter's life but only when it's convenient and he can look good like walking her down and having a photoshoot with *his* whole family at the wedding the aisle and being grandpa. Other than that the daughter is supposed always be the one to reach out and keep him informed because that's too much work for him. When she does reach out it's fine if he behaves like a petulant child and doesn't answer.", "I don't even think 13 is highschool, pretty sure that's middle school for most places.  God damn OP, YTA.", "I\u2019m sorry", " Eh \u2014 he doesn\u2019t care.", "As someone who did gymnastics for years I can guarantee that another parent or even the coach would be able to get her to the competition if he is busy that weekend, especially if it is just a once off.

OP has hurt his oldest enough.", "I didn't change. My older daughter did. She cried when i told her my wife was pregnant the first time, and she didn't come to meet her new sister until after several months. I don't understand why she doesn't want a relationship with her sisters. She is close with her half sister on her mothers side.", "Better he doesn't go at this point, He'll just drag it through the mud. \n\nIf any, she should just cut what little contact there is. Just ignore him if he ever realizes what he lost if ever. Just leave the absent sperm donor in the past. He left her behind years ago, she probably just realizing it now.", "The way he tries to blame his daughter for the relationship is disgusting. Doesn\u2019t communicate, doesn\u2019t apologize, doesn\u2019t make an effort. I would LOVE to hear her side.", "Right? And why doesn\u2019t she have a license? In the US that\u2019s almost a requirement since we have a very poor public transportation system. So even if you don\u2019t have two cars you should at least know how to drive. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s cultural.", "And if he is hurt about the gender, he should realize his blas\u00e9 reaction is why he doesn\u2019t know anything. Lol. He made it seem like no big deal to him, so she decided to match his energy. He only wanted to know the gender, but couldn\u2019t check on his daughter? Barely called? He seems to have always expected her to be the one to be the adult in their relationship even as a teen. Small wonder she finally dropped the rope.", "Yeah. I fail to believe they couldn\u2019t get a ride with someone else on the team. Or booked a flight or taken the bus. Or\u2026 anything.

She did nothing wrong.", "How did the daughter hurt OP?", "He says things changed after the younger daughters were born - I think this is where he left some stuff out - notably, the age of the current wife.  I'll bet she is a similar age to the eldest daughter - maybe a few years older at the most.  That might explain a few things..........", "Doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to. Poor daughter.", "I only talked to my dad a couple of times a year. Our relationship was almost always strained for a variety of reasons.\n\nHe still would have been way more excited than OP to find out I was pregnant -- not just said \"okay, tell me when you know if it has a penis\" (I'm paraphrasing OP, of course).", "Is that not normal? \n\nMy dad and I live in different cities, about 5 hours apart.  We talk every 4 - 5 months or so.  I always assumed that was normal.", "Yeah idk what the right answer is here but I don\u2019t think the answer is child can\u2019t go to competition for a wedding she\u2019s not invited to", "I would say that unless he truly wants to make amends in her life he shouldn't go to the wedding, just send a gift and a congratulations card. YTA OP and you have been for 30+ years.\n\nYou ruined the relationship with your oldest so unless you really want to put in the work to just let her go. She more than likely hates you and could go the rest of her life without hearing from you and it would be fine. Half assed attempts to fix it will only make it worse.", "I had a sibling and two parents who worked, one odd hours. Some mix of grandparents, parents, and siblings were at an event, but never all unless it was a milestone. That was just\u2026 life.", "Yes! 4 kids who all did various sports. Not every parent can attend every event and there were always volunteers to get them there!", "Maybe because her mother always put in the effort to maintain a good relationship with her and cared for her.  Whereas it sounds like you mostly abandoned her.", "Because you probably did something that made her feel less important to you than your new wife and daughters. And the fact that you would ditch her wedding for her half sisters gym tournament is a great indicator of that.\n\nDid your daughter have complaints about your wife? Did she have out ursts at your home? Did you MAKE HER FEEL WANTED WHEN SHE STAYED WITH YOU?", "I\u2019m not going to rehash what everyone has already said here, but I will point out this was your eldest daughter\u2019s final olive branch to you. Like, this is it. If you don\u2019t go to her wedding, there\u2019s no coming back from that. \n\nYour kid could get a ride with someone else. I\u2019m sure someone on the gymnastics team has parents that could take her, too. \n\nYTA.

Did you explore this with her? Did you reassure her that she was still your child and wasn\u2019t being replaced?", "This depends on the reason you and her mother got separated. In some cases, it is nothing but normal for kids to hate their half siblings, step-parent, and the parent.", "Honestly considering how she didn't call or even texted him when she was pregnant or gave birth I think it's safe to assume that his wedding invitation was a token invitation so that she doesn't get any beef from family members for not inviting her father to her wedding.

Do they know and celebrate when good things happen? do they keep track of you via social media, because they might not feel disconnected from you if they know whats happening in your life. \n\nPeople have very different relationships with parents so honestly I don't think we can judge only by the amount people talk. \n\nI'd even risk saying that some relationships are bettter with less contact.  \"Distance makes the heart grow fonder\"  LOL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn OPs case, not even knowing his grandkid was born... seems a bit too disconnected and uncaring.", "My dad and I live in different countries, and chat a couple of times a week.", "Well, good thing that child has a second parent who can look into planes, trains, buses, or carpools to take her.", "I think it really depends on the competition.

My wife is always nice to my daughter, but i am not sure if my daughter likes her. \nMy daughter had her then boyfriend live with me too, and i gave them their own space in the house (2 room and a living space). \nMy wife and my daughter had some disagreements over chores because my wife is very into keeping the house clean at all times.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f the Best comment", "She just gave birth? \n\nCalling family is the last thing on the list of \u201cthings to do\u201d with, and for, a new born.\n\nOP failed his daughter YEARS before her pregnancy.

You said you and your daughter had a good relationship up until you had your new kids. Clearly something went wrong and you as a parent likely dropped the ball and from what you're saying didn't try all that hard to pick it back up. You talk to her twice a year with no mention of really trying outside that? \n\nShe tells you she's pregnant and you say 'cool let me know what the gender is'. No checking up on her over the next weeks/months. \n\nAnd now when she's getting married you're like 'ok, well your once in a lifetime (hopefully) event isn't as important as gymnastics.'", "Let me get this straight:\n\nYour daughter lived with you for a year at 16. They had their own independent living space to maintain as they like. Your wife found it reasonable to disagree and argue with how they managed their own living space? There's a difference between 'I don't like how she keeps her space' and 'please try to not leave these things here, it will bring pests'\n\nAt age 20, your daughter, who left living with you three years ago, cried when you told her your wife was pregnant.
