What a scrooge to take half the winnings.", "NTA. If he wants to win on scratchers he shouldn\u2019t give them to other people - he should have done them himself. I\u2019m sorry that you probably still feel guilt for something that was a weird power play in the first place, and absolutely not your fault. It\u2019s a super weird expectation to place on people. NTA. Your family is questionable, though.", "NTA- I knew someone like your grandfather.  I ask him if I gave him a can of soda as a gift, could I have half. He said no it was a gift. So I ask him why he ask for half of the scratch off money from his kids/grandkids if it was a gift.  The look on his face was priceless.", "NTA, It was a gift and he was not entitled to half of it. If he gave you $100 would you give him half back?", "NTA \n\nOnce you receive a gift, it belongs to you. Even if his came with a string attached, you are free to cut it.", "NTA.\n\nPeriodically, I buy about a hundred bucks in scratchers for each of my guys at work because it is a fun and dumb thing to do.  We all sit around after work and hangout for a bit just BSing and scratching off a ton of them.\n\nEven though it is like $700 out of my pocket, I have never expected a cent if any of them won. \n\nYou gift people things to bring joy or a good time to them, not to potentially benefit from it.", "NTA he's a jerk", "NTA hahaha, funny story tho.", "NTA. Gifts are given with the intention of not receiving anything in return. He was TA for wanting a part of his gift back.", "NTA. The only thing you did wrong was let other people know. Lesson learned.", "Nope definitely NTA but grandpa is. He gave you a gift, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s entitled to half of it!! Maybe if you win millions, you could share, but even then you\u2019re not obligated to!", "NTA. I could see joking about a nominal commission if it won a jackpot prize, but Gramps was clearly someone that needed a visit from Jacob Marley.", "NTA and I would've done the same.\n\nYou don't give a gift and then ask for part of it back.  If you are that way inclined scratch them yourself.  He did this because it looked like a good gift... but he was too cheap to buy his own scratchies so it was a benefit either way - gift done with the bonus of getting money back.\n\nYour relatives are probably upset that they didn't stand up to him for all their 'winnings' and just gave them to him like he wanted when they didn't want to.", "NTA - But make sure he knows where you're coming from, its only fair. Not gon na lie it seems petty to take $50, its not life changing money or anything, but i get its more about the principle than anything. grandparents suck sometimes but they aint around forever, its not worth letting another day go by where youre both mad at eachother over this", "I think this is less you worrying about if your family is AHs or you're an AH, and more you worrying about if you wronged your now-deceased grandfather.\n\nAnd... it's not really a question of AHs anyway. It's a question of values.\n\nWas what your grandfather doing right or wrong? I'd say wrong because it devalues what is already a low-value, low-effort gift.\n\nWas keeping the winnings despite what your grandfather said right or wrong? I'd say right because once someone gives you a gift, both the law and the social custom dictate that it is *yours*, and yours alone.\n\nWas it right or wrong to tell your girlfriend about this thing your grandfather did, and how you won? I'd... say right on this one. It's not good to gossip, but I don't think that's what this is. We have a right to discuss our problems... even if those are family problems with our friends and SOs.\n\nWas it right or wrong to lie to your grandfather? This one is hard, because I strive to be as honest as possible, always. I don't ever tell a straight-out lie. I rarely lie by reframing/manipulating information. I only occasionally lie by omission... and usually that's because it's no one's business. But that's because I have trauma around lying. I expect my child to be honest, but do not hold my child to my standards. So.. for me, I would not have lied, but I don't think it was wrong here. It was part of keeping the full gift, which was right.\n\nWas it right or wrong to stand by your principles when your family confronted you? I'd say right. \n\nAnd the fact that you still stand by that years later indicates that you truly believe in these principles. \n\nSince no one was actually harmed, I don't see it as a huge problem.\n\nBut there could be important details I don't know. If your grandpa was super poor and buying gifts for 10 children and 30 grandchildren for Christmas and Birthdays for 20 years, that's ... 12k scratch offs? If they're $2 each, that's $24,000. And if everyone's always played along, giving a buck here, $5 there, might have made it feel like a treasured tradition?\n\nDid everyone else in the family have the same view of it as you did?\n\nSee... my values are my own, and my knowledge is incomplete.\n\nOnly you can decide if you feel comfortable with what you've done. \n\nAnd while I don't think you're the AH, I also can't fault your family for saying lying is wrong. Or chide anyone on their choice of gifts/traditions. And I'm not going to call a deceased man who can't defend himself an AH anyway. And no one pressured you after the initial confrontation. So I guess I would go with NAH", "NTA.   I guess the now politically-incorrect term would be \"Indian giver.\"   What a despicable cad he was!\n\nAnd my compliments for using the rather unusual noun \"perfidy\".", "ESH because *why did you tell anyone??* You're right about it being inappropriate for your grandfather to request half the winnings, but there was no need to tell anyone you won.
