Extremely creepy but it became a joke between us.\n\nSo one of my friends, Annie was having a bad day and we were trying to make her laugh so my other friend, Jennifer put a photo of a penis shaped carrot at her profile pic and I thought it was hilarious so I did the same with a potato pic. Yes, I know. It\u2019s all very silly but it was just a harmless joke to cheer up a friend\u2026 or so I thought. \n\nAbout an hour later, I got a message from my ex cursing me out and saying \u201cgood luck with the disgusting new penis in your life you whore\u201d \u2026 I told him to calm down because it\u2019s not a penis and to mind his own business.. he insisted that I was lying and continued to go off on me saying that I posted it on purpose because I wanted him to see it, which doesn\u2019t even make sense because I honestly had no clue he even used the app   and we haven\u2019t spoken for over a month. \n\nI told him that he should stop stalking me because he\u2019s embarrassing himself and that I hope he knows he\u2019s jealous of a potato.\n\nAITA for posting that even though it was just meant as a joke between my friends?
