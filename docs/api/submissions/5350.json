She embarrassed herself, trying to be all woke while not even knowing what she was talking about.", "NTA. What she did it's really ridiculous, the issue with Hailey Bieber thing was that she claimed to invent something they she didn't, plus latinos don't have a \"look\" because it's a ethnicity and not a race", "I don't understand.

That seems kind of insulting.", "Not your fault her BS blew up in her face lol", "This could be posted in r/ShitAmericansSay", "NTA", "NAH - I actually commend the girl for trying to call out (what she thought was) racism. More people should have the courage to do it. Her approach was obviously misguided, but hopefully, she\u2019s learned her lesson. You (OP) - of course - did nothing wrong and handled it well. It seems like you were pretty lighthearted about her mistake.

She was rude, judgmental, intrusive, and flat-out wrong in her assumptions.  What anyone chooses to wear is their own business and no one else's.
