Your parents should pay the other half since they told him he could use the car.", "NTA, you certainly don't owe anyone an apology and this whole situation around the car is a mess. The original deal with your parents would have been fine, but once they stepped in and let the AH drive they ruined it and made it an absolutely terrible situation for you.\n\nI would suggest you refuse to pay anything towards the car at all - no payments, no maintenance/repairs, etc., and see about getting your own personal car that absolutely no one else is allowed to drive. Better still, if you can find a way to move out (not sure if that's possible at this time), do so.", "NTA...your instincts were correct when you didn't want to take over the car payments. You shouldn't have let your parents persuade you. Everything is NOT okay. Put this issue in their lap now.", "NTA no dont apologise, go after them for the repairs. If theyd said no to him driving it none of this would of happened.", "nta. he needs to get a job and get his own car; you need to talk to your parents and settle the ownership situation. Either it is your or not. If it is going to be a communal car, then he needs to pay to use it too.", "NTA. Please stop being persuaded that everything happening is your fault. If you need to sit your parents down separately and explain it to them, do that. If it means starting your position and not engaging, then do that. But don't let them keep gaslighting you.", "NTA.\n\nBut your parents sure are. At this point, if you made the payments and that was the condition for it to be your primary responsibility, they never should've given him any sort of permission to use it. I'd suggest that your parents handle the rest of the cost. None of this would have happened if they didn't say anything. Also, do not apologize to your sister or BIL. You'll end up settling the tone that he can damage property and not have to worry about being an adult and taking care of his responsibilities.", "NTA, just because none of them has the spine to stand up to a 22yo AH doesn\u2019t mean you should bite the bullet. If there\u2019s any way to afford a different car, do that instead of putting another cent into a car that you pay for but can\u2019t rely on. Idk where you are but here you could definitely get a car that\u2019ll last you another year or two for the amount you\u2018re supposed to pay to get this one fixed when you didn\u2019t break it.", "You're NTA. He damaged the car. He should pay for the damage he caused.", "NTA. This is an awful situation since the adults aren't protecting you or standing up for your stuff properly. I'd try and get my money back for the car and honestly move out ASAP and go lower contact with your family until they get this guy out. He's likely dangerous. Walking into your room like that is an intimidation technique. The cat thing is too. And your parents are so busy trying not to alienate your sister they're not wanting to see these things.", "Nta", "NTA. Don't pay another dime for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
