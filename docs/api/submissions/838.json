I\u2019m a college student and own a three bedroom apartment, where I use one room and rent the other two out. At the beginning of last academic year, I rented it out to two of my close friends on a 10 month lease (September through June). My plan was for them to either extend the lease through the summer or for me to rent it out to someone else after that. I asked them both in March and they both declined to extend it, but they were potentially down to return in September, when classes start. \n\nOne of the roommates, Brian, went home before the lease was up (mid June instead of late June) and left all of his stuff in the room. We hadn\u2019t discussed any summer storage plans, but if I found a renter, I would ask him to come and clear his stuff out (the furniture was a mix between his and mine. I provided the dresser and wardrobe, he provided the bed and desk.) Due to COVID, I wasn\u2019t able to find anyone interested in renting out the room, so it ended up not coming up. \n\nThe next month, after Brian\u2019s lease was up and he had moved out, I was hanging with my friend Julie and it had gotten late (about 3 AM). The plan was for her to sleep on the couch but she asked if she could sleep in one of the vacant bedrooms. I said sure and she slept in Brian\u2019s former room. \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it until a few weeks later, when I get angry texts from Brian. He had gotten into the apartment (apparently he took a copy of the key with him when he left) and was upset that someone had entered the room and been in his bed. Meanwhile, I was upset that he entered my apartment without permission and while I wasn\u2019t there. \n\nHe stopped communicating with me, but then Julie texts me that she\u2019s been getting texts and calls from Brian (the two have met once before). He ended up calling her for over half an hour while she was too nervous to hang up on him, and he berated her for entering someone\u2019s room without permission. She apologized repeatedly, but he wanted her to say that I gave permission so that he could blame me. She refused to do that since she didn\u2019t want to cause conflict between us. \n\nUnsurprisingly, all the friends I share with Julie think I'm in the right while all the friends I share with Brian think I'm in the wrong.

Along with the guy entering the house. That doesn't justify the OP giving permission to sleep in someone else's bed though.", "How nice of you to decide other people's boundaries for them.", "This is the way.", "This is what I would say.", "This. And change your mf locks!", "Maybe. The police aren't usually going to do much if someone has a key, because there is an implication they were invited.", "It's not a matter of personal boundaries. The room was no longer Brian's, so it was no longer within his personal space. His right to set boundaries within it ended when he stopped paying for the space.\n\nThe bed was still his, yes, but the space it occupied was not. As the OP passively agreed to store his stuff, Brian retained the right to reclaim the bed in the same state of repair as he left it...but he *lost* the right to completely control its use while it dwelt in OP's apartment.\n\nBoundaries can only extend to space you have a right to exert control over.", "Most people you \"invite\" don't get a key.  He WAS on the lease, now he isn't anymore. It won't take a genius to figure out how he has a key.", "NTA- As you said his lease was up, he's lucky you didn't put his stuff on the curb which would have been your right. He had no right entering your appt after this, you could have called the police. Change the locks and tell anyone that argues about the room to kick rocks.", "Yep yta.", "NTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his room anymore.  Leaving his furniture without your permission doesn\u2019t make it his room!", "Brian tentatively committed to moving back in come September and believed / assumed / thought no one was going to use \u201chis\u201d room during July and August.  Brian was saving himself 2 months rent and expecting it to remain empty and unused and available until he moved back in September. While that might have happened he is actually lucky the OP didn\u2019t require the removal of all his property and return of the key(s) at the end of June when he left.  Then Brian would have had to move his furniture out then in again in September.  They were both taking shortcuts which blurred the boundaries a little.  Brian is YTA for the nonsense with friend Julie as none of this was her fault. At that point Brian was venting his displeasure on the wrong person as he was unsuccessful with OP and probably didn\u2019t want to engage OP further and put his plans for September housing in jeopardy.  If someone using his bed was such an issue Brian could have removed it and returned it in September.  Hope OP learned a lesson about this as they were too flexible in the terms of rent / use.", "NTA He's trespassing, being all-around creepy, and lost all rights to the room the moment his lease ended. You say he has a copy of the key? Unacceptable! You must change the locks immediately, set up a camera, and call the police if he shows up again and doesn't leave when you tell him to.", "Look up when property is abandoned in your location. Pack up all of Brian's stuff and tell him he has xx days to get it or it's being sold because it's already your property. Change your locks. Do not rent to Brian again who thought he was being cute and leaving all his stuff at your house for free for months so he could come back and move back in or so he could move his stuff somewhere else easier. NTA.", "NTA. Time to sell his shit. If you haven\u2019t already. As soon as that lease ended that stuff became yours. If he ever comes in using that stolen key again call the cops. Actually rekey the locks ASAP. You don\u2019t need that risk.", "NTA\u2026your friends are using you.  They don\u2019t want to renew their lease, but there is the chance that they might come back in the fall.  What they are really saying is that they don\u2019t want to pay rent for those months, but they will come back in the fall and you can store their stuff for free.  Stop doing that.  You don\u2019t pay rent, you move your stuff out.  Now, if you can afford to do so, and want to do so you could charge them a lower rate to keep their room over the summer which would keep it \u201ctheir\u201d room and there by, no one should be allowed in said room.", "NTA - the timing is somewhat important here; Brian did not extend his lease, therefore he was no longer a tenant. It was not his room to define what happens; this is YOUR apartment. You own it. You decide who goes in or not. \nI suggest you demand that key back immediately - Brian took a spare key without permission and did not return it at the end of his lease. Yours is the only voice that matters in this case!", ">And frankly, I\u2019m curious how often he has been. I really doubt it was just that one time. \n\nThis! It is highly doubtful that this was the only time he entered without permission. I'm curious what excuse he gave, if any, for his actions. Regardless, the locks need to be changed ASAP because he obviously can't be trusted."]}
