OP is mad his sons step father has a better relationship with his son than he does.\n\nOP, YTA. Step up and be a better parent instead of trying to remove the one your son prefers over you.", "YTA.  It is disgusting that you are sexualizing your son.  The kid is 6, maybe he doesn\u2019t like his mom seeing him naked and prefers Tyler giving him the bath.  Since Tyler is doing the bath time with Ian, I\u2019m sure Tyler and Amber have already discussed it and don\u2019t see a problem with it.\n\nI am sure they understand what you said.  If how they are taking it is not what you mean.  You need to explain it better.  Because what I got from what you wrote on here, it that you are a complete and utter Asshole.  You are implying that Tyler has a sexual response to giving Ian baths.", "Yta. You are definitely implying that you don't trust him and your diaper example is ridiculous. If\na child goes to daycare, it's ok for a stranger to change their diaper, but not a step parent?", "Yta.  Its his step-dad.  His 3rd parent.  And you accused him of being a pedophile because he gives his kid, legally his kid, a bath.  With no signs at all of inappropriate behaviour mentioned.  I dare you to bring up the bedtime routine in Tyler's house during a custody dispute.  You'll be laughed at.\n\n  And what is wrong with a boyfriend or girlfriend changing a baby's diaper?  I've changed cousins kids diapers, the diapers of kids I'm babysitting, a bunch of babies.  Do you seriously think parents never let anyone other than themselves diaper their kid?  Why do you sexualize changing a diaper and think anyone unrelated doing it is  predator?", "YTA, you don't have any say in how the care tasks in your exist home are allocated. This works for their family and she trusts him with this, unless you have some cause for concern around him being with your son, then it's not of your business.", "You are a complete and total TA for shaming this man. He is giving his heart to being a good stepfather and you are acting like it's weird for him to help your six year old take a bath\u2014something he does not want his mother to do, and yes, you are sexualizing it, no way around that from your post and your canned defensive responses to people telling you so. This is Reddit, where you came to find out if you are TA, not to argue with the obvious verdict that yeah, you are.", "YTA. It would be much the same if you had a daughter instead of a son. If you had a wife, you'd probably be more okay with your wife giving her a bath than doing it yourself when they hit that age. They get self conscious. Amber is his mom, yes, but she's also aware that her growing son doesn't want to have her see him naked. It's more comfortable for him to have Tyler in there chatting with him because they all have the same parts and no one's feeling any kind of way.\n\nExcept for you. And implying that 'I don't feel comfortable' only has ONE implication, and that's that Tyler isn't a safe adult for your son to be around in a vulnerable position. And btw? There's NOTHING WRONG with a bf/gf changing a baby's diaper. It's (gasp) like babysitters doing it? Would you rather your kid sits in their own shit until one of their bio parents wipes them? \n\nYou have some issues, dude. I suggest a therapist.", "What is your concern about him helping your son here?", "YTA\n\nYou're either jealous or implying that he's being inappropriate. \n\n>This is really something that needs to be taken care of by me and Amber.\n\n\n\nShe's your ex. You don't get to tell her husband what you think she should be doing.", "YTA seriously?", "YTA. This isn't some random bf that has only just appeared on the scene, this is her husband of a few years. You were vague so let's assume a few is 3 years. He's been a parent to your son since he was 3. Of course he's going to give him baths!! You're the one making this incredibly weird!", "YTA - you've already stated that your son is having a problem with his mother seeing him. Who else will supervise your son if not him, Santa Claus? Or do you suggest your son go without bathing until you can get around to seeing him?\n\nDo you suspect some kind of sexual impropriety going on between your son and his step-father? Then go to the courts, or ask for an investigation via CPS. If you don't and you're just jealous of the time he spends with your son, and the fact that he actually helps in the child care, then you seriously need therapy for your issues.", "YTA and for no reason too! You literally start by praising him that there\u2019s a 3rd adult in helping with him then just contradict yourself for no. reason at all. I can\u2019t even imagine if you had a daughter. Grow up dude.", "YTA. They\u2019ve been married for a few years, so presumably since he was at least 3. Did you really think in all that time he\u2019d never given the kid a bath? It was likely something you never thought about. Continue doing that (not thinking about it). \n\nYou are making a big deal out of something that isn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t some new, random person. You are the one making implications here. Stop doing that.", "Are you the same guy who posts about what his kids stepdad does with him?", "you're making things weird when they really don't need to be. A boyfriend/girlfriend changing a kid's diaper isn't weird. What exactly about it makes you uncomfortable? \"it's not his job\" is not a valid answer. it's not his job to feed him, make sure he brushes his teeth or put his toys away either, but I assume you wouldn't have a problem with any of those.", "YTA.\n\nYou wrote it's not his job but really it kinda is. And it seems he cares about you child a lot and you should be grateful for that. Right now it's like you accusing him of something. I would be ofended too if I were him. And frankly however they (your ex and her SO) split this kind of chores between themselfs is not you business as long as they take good care of your kid.", "[removed]", "YTA.  My son is 6 and has a different dad. My husband, son's stepdad, is the one that bathes him. Nothing goes on in there except a lot of laughing, singing etc. hubby sits and monitors while son washes himself. If he doesn't do something right, husband shows him how to do it.  \n\nIf husband isn't able to give him a bath, I'll give him one, but will do the same thing, I allow him to play with his toys, laugh, sing etc and when it's time to clean his body, he does it by himself. He just turned 6 and needs some supervision, but for the most part it's just a matter of making sure he knows what to do in order to transition to getting into the routine of bathing without anyone helping him. There are great stepparents out there, be grateful your son isn't neglected and is loved by someone who isn't their flesh and blood.  I'm a mommy of my own, but before that I took care of two of my stepchildren alone while hubby was deployed to Iraq. \n\nDo you know how thankless that can be?? To love a child that isn't your own with all your heart, yet certain people don't appreciate it?  No wonder the poor guy cried. Apologize and have a beer with him, thank him for loving your child.", "You!", "YTA. It\u2019s his stepfather who he clearly has a good relationship with. You\u2019re weird thinking no one but the parents can see a child naked. It would be neglectful and child abuse if you had to always wait for a parent to change them. Daycare staff and babysitters aren\u2019t the parents but still need to do it\n\nEdit: I see you\u2019ve come up with some weird professionals aren\u2019t the same. So what about other relatives?

I think many of us know all too well that the majority of children that are sexually abused are abused by someone known very well to them and by someone they trust, often in their family. Children may not even realize they're being sexually abused, and they often don't report or tell. \n\nWith that said, it's time for you to figure out what to do with those fears with the knowledge your kid lives with his mom and his other dad much of the time. You need to have an honest conversation about your fears with Callie/Amber (?) and Tyler and apologize for offending them, but explaining where you were coming from and why. And then the three of you need to talk about how you can talk with your kid about bodies, privacy, private parts, adults, etc. My kid's pediatrician told him his mouth was a private part and it blew my mind! \n\nBetter to get on the same page and actively prepare as a team of parents for a fear that is and should be very real.", "NTA BUT - Whole lot of hair trigger judgments here. Parents are allowed to be concerned. Parents are allowed to ask questions and make requests of their ex partners with regards to the raising of their kids it's called co-parenting. I would need some evidence of wrongdoing. I would also want a more specific amount of time that stepdad has been in this child's life. Another thing that kind of hits my radar is if you have an issue with the stepdad you go to your ex you don't address it directly with the stepdad. You don't co-parent with the stepdad. you co-parent with your ex she is responsible for everything that happens to that kid. The vetting of the people she lets around the child and what happens in the course of the day with the kid is her responsibility and if she wants to delegate that to somebody else then it's on her to ensure the people she gets are safe and responsible people. Again is there any evidence indicating that there has been a lack of responsibility on her part.", "I was mostly on team \u201cyou might be overreacting here\u201d until I got to the part where Tyler was so offended he cried. \n\nSomeone who understands why you would be concerned about an unrelated person doing intimate personal care with your child would not react that way.\n\nSomeone invested in doing intimate personal care with a child for their own reasons would.

Callie and I share custody of our 6yo son Ian. I am totally happy for any person who wants to be loving, caring and supportive figure for Ian including Tyler.\n\nTyler and I get along and I know he does love Ian. For Son's Day, Tyler posted a tribute to Ian saying how much he values him and how proud he is to have him as a stepson. He started listing activities he does with Ian and one caught my attention- bath Tic Tac Toe.\n\nI DM'd and thanked him for the post and jokingly said he ought to edit his post because it makes it seem like he's taking a bath with Ian to play Tic Tac Toe. He said of course not, he gives him a bath not taking one with him. \n\nThat rubbed me the wrong way and I had to process it for a few days before deciding if and I was going to respond to Tyler giving my son a bath. I do give Ian baths because this kid will everything in the tub but bathe. \n\nI finally replied to Tyler yesterday and jokingly said I guess Amber (the ex) is too busy to give Ian a bath? He said Ian is very modest around her and he's happy to help out by giving Ian a bath so she can take a break and he and Ian can hang out. He does the whole night-time routine with Ian.\n\nI said please don't take this the wrong way but please don't give Ian a bath. Yes, he needs them and needs help but that's something you shouldn't be doing. We should discuss with Amber. \n\nHe was deeply offended. I said it's not what you think. This is really something that needs to be taken care of by me and Amber. It's like having someone's boyfriend or girlfriend changing their kid's diaper.\n\nMy ex is furious at me for suggesting that I don't trust Tyler and said that he was so offended that he cried. I said that they both aren't understanding what I said and I'm not explaining it again.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So I'd suggest asking you're son about the hobbies he likes doing with hes stepdad and he will probably bring the bathing up so then you owe the stepdad a huge apology.", "YTA. He is giving your son a bath. There is nothing inappropriate about that. Aside from which, it is none of your business how the parenting duties are split in your ex partners home, proving your child is loved, safe, warm and fed. Similarly, she has no business interfering with what goes on in house. You owe him an apology.", "YTA you feeling weird about it means nothing. You don't control their household. Has your son expressed discomfort? Has your son said he wouldn't like? Has your son's behavior changed? If not then what leg do you have to stand on besides being rude to an innocent man. He is taking care of your child and doing a damn good job if the child is comfortable. You need to stop and figure out what your problem is. He is his step parent and whatever his partner asks or the child asks of him that his job to do.", "YTA. Your ex has deemed him a safe person to have in your sons life. It seems you think he is a good dude too. \n\nWhy, as his stepfather, can he not care for his step-son in such a basic way as a bath? \n\nUltimately I think alot of this choice comes down to your son and who he feels comfortable bathing him.", "YTA", "So is your ex Callie or Amber? \n\n\nYTA anyway.", "YTA I have changed so many diapers of kids that were not mine. My son had his diaper changed by lots of friends and family. Get over yourself.", "Info what does your SON want? Not YOU, or TYLER, or AMBER, your SON. None of this is about any of y'all. It's about the kid in question. What does HE WANT? does he prefer his mum or step father to do bath routine? Cause if he's uncomfortable with Tyler than yes it needs to stop BUT if he's more comfortable with Tyler than his mum then guess what? You need to back off. He's 6 he's old enough to communicate if something makes him uncomfortable. If he prefers his mum NOT see him naked then respect that. The only time.you should be stepping in is if your son says \"this makes me uncomfortable.\" And so far you haven't said it has. It makes YOU uncomfortable but why? It's a bath. Nothing else and Tyler isn't IN the bath with him (if he was then yes id be on your side cause at 6 you should need anyone in with you unless you need a LOT of support or are special needs etc. This isn't that situation though.)\n\nAsk your SON what he wants without being judgemental or persuasive in order to get what you want.
