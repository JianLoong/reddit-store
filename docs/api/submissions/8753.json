And the state they left it in is exactly why. \n\nHowever, I'm torn about the cleaning fee...a full cleaning is expected between every guest regardless. The sheets should be cleaned between everyone who sleeps on them, everything wiped down. This means the cleaning fee should have been expected no matter the condition of the room. The extra fee hotels tag on as a deposit? That's for damaged property, such as things being broken or something so stained it must be replaced or specialty cleaned... but basic turn over is built into the charge of the room. So unless something needed replaced or specialty cleaned (such as needing to rent a floor cleaner or some such) then I deeply question the act of charging the extra... that was kinda an AH move without knowing the true extent of the room.", "They accommodated a holiday home, which could otherwise be rented out to a paying customer.\n\nThey used a service, they can pay for it.\n\nNta", "NTA - But lesson is friends and your business don\u2019t mix.

Instead, they paid you a generously reduced rate, taking on themselves the obligations of the rental.
