And from the sound of it they tried to take advantage in everyway they could. The fact that an impartial 3rd party was upset by the state of the place tells me you\u2019re NTA and need some better friends", "NTA, and they do come off as very entitled. I mean, you already dropped it to 70% and they didn't even try to respect your property, but basically dirtied it to the point sheets had to be professionally cleaned...", "NTA. You tried to be nice and give them a discounted rate on something you rent out for money, and they turn around and cost you money in cleaning fees. Next time, write the cleaning fee into the rental agreement and take a cleaning deposit up front. You're an adult with a business and these \"friends\" took advantage of you.", "NTA...they don't sound like friends to me. They tried to use you and are pissed that you didn't let them take advantage of you to the extent they wanted.", "NTA.  Hit them with the full charge and with luck you will never see them again.", "NTA for charging rental fee. And the state they left it in is exactly why. \n\nHowever, I'm torn about the cleaning fee...a full cleaning is expected between every guest regardless. The sheets should be cleaned between everyone who sleeps on them, everything wiped down. This means the cleaning fee should have been expected no matter the condition of the room. The extra fee hotels tag on as a deposit? That's for damaged property, such as things being broken or something so stained it must be replaced or specialty cleaned... but basic turn over is built into the charge of the room. So unless something needed replaced or specialty cleaned (such as needing to rent a floor cleaner or some such) then I deeply question the act of charging the extra... that was kinda an AH move without knowing the true extent of the room.", "They accommodated a holiday home, which could otherwise be rented out to a paying customer.\n\nThey used a service, they can pay for it.\n\nNta", "NTA - But lesson is friends and your business don\u2019t mix. Too often people take advantage of friends and family members who run their own business. This is very disrespectful but some people feel entitled to free stuff just because they know you. Get your fees from these people and next time tell them they\u2019ll need to rent from someone else.", "NTA\nDid the maid take pictures? I\u2019d be really chill about it and ignore their complaining, messes happen, they just need to pay. But also maybe, not real friends.", "NTA. Your friends are being unreasonable. If it costs you money to clean the apartment after they used it, that should be added onto the bill.", "NTA. People want to ask friends for favors but gosh forbid you point out something that they don\u2019t want to hear and you\u2019re the \u2018jerk\u2019. \n\nFor future reference, I\u2019d let anyone (family or friends) know that their is a cleaning fee, regardless, because having anyone stay at your place, in Italy, is a courtesy not a privilege. Keeping it clean is just a part of maintenance.", "NTA, they are no friends.", "NTA. You don't take advantage of friends either.", "This is tricky. There are many schools of thought about \u201cYou don\u2019t charge friends\u201d. Yours seems to be \u201cYou give them a discount\u201d. That\u2019s a valid position. Theirs seems to be \u201cyou don\u2019t charge friends\u201d. That\u2019s also a valid position. Interestingly, both positions seem convenient for those who hold them, but nevermind. \n\nIf they were uncomfortable with you charging them, they could have done what I did, and not pay you or accept the service. Instead, they paid you a generously reduced rate, taking on themselves the obligations of the rental. They failed to live up to them, and a (again reduced) fee was imposed. \n\nYour actions (give friends a discount) are extremely consistent. Their views (you doing charge friends) are consistent with everything but their actions, since they accepted the offer. I\u2019ll add that the you-don\u2019t-charge-friends crowd generally favors not trashing the uncharged-for resources. \n\nNTA", "NTA - 30% off is a good deal and they should have respected your place.

Do they not wash them after each guest, or was this a special washing?", "I'm assuming he meant dry cleaners.", "I was thinking that they were in such condition that the maid didn't want/wasn't able to do it? If they are good quality sheets and are stained or dirty with stuff that is difficult to remove, I totally understand taking them to a professional. And if they were covered in say, bodily fluids that have to be hand washed... yeah I wouldn't do it either."]}
