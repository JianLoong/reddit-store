I was told by a very nice girl who was a self proclaimed Gypsy and this is what she told me. I became familiar with her bc her and her family were kicked out of a location I worked at. Sure they were a pain and would try to skip out on the bill, by ordering well done butterfly steaks and complaining that they were inedible. But that just being cheap and honeslty no one person or group has the corner stone on cheap. \n\nAnyway. I was very surprised, bc I had a nice report with her and they requested me regularly bc i handled their BS well enough, but after a couple of months it escalated. I almost got fired bc they stole everything in one of our rooms. Down the table cloths and napkins and 10s of thousands worth if display wines. Long story short, she and her extended family got blacklisted and she told me they werent allowed at the local hospital anymore bc of more misunderstandings. She was nice enough about me confronting her and demanding everything back to save my job, but not apologetic about my almost firing. She explained that she and her family believed that it was their right to take, and she explained that God left things out in the open for them to take. I was pretty floored, but happy I got everything back and no charges were brought. \n\nGrowing up Catholic and living in a state that has the most f'ed up version of of the FDLS, I know religious off shoots can have some really horrible belief systems that harm people and everyone around them. I am pretty much antireligion in general and I figured that the pejorative was out there was because their religion told them they could steal. \n\nTo be clear I am not condoning the word, just more curious on how the religious aspect relates to the acts of theft.", "Yes. Are American Gypsy religious sects different than European? \n\nI am genuinely curious about the religious aspect of condoned theft.  I know I am getting down voted for asking, but my experience on the relationship, is what I what I was told from a member of this group. It could be wrong, they could have been lying to me, but the gal seemed sincere about why her family stole and and that their \"Prince\" (leader) had condoned the behavior as part of their religion.", "[removed]", "Gotcha that makes sense.

Context is key.", "Exactly, I know the show and I assumed because the title, it's okay to use. Then, I was in a secret group on social media that put a lot of emotional labor into racial and other slurs used, where they came from, and why you shouldn't use them. The word j!p never came up, but the word g*psy did. Once i learn a word is bad, I remove it from my vocabulary if I was using it. \n\nI appreciate anyone who breaks down things like racial slurs and I feel their emotional labor should be compensated if sought out.

I think it's really ones own choice on whether to decide to charge friends, it's definitely not a rule of thumb or code. \n\nSo you're NTA for charging them. I am curious though, is the extra cleaning fee something that people can see online or made aware of before hand? \n\nI don't think you'd be TA if they weren't aware, because it was quite a disaster, but if it isn't clear already I would make it clear for the future to save yourself any headaches.\n\nOverall, NTA.", "I'm sorry, I don't watch American politics.
