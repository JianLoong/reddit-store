I have many scars and I don\u2019t trust that he won\u2019t make a scene at what is supposed to be the happiest moment of my life. \n\nAmy and I are in agreement, but my parents say I\u2019m being selfish. \n\nMy mother told me that if Daniel\u2019s not going, I will have to call off the wedding. More than that, if Daniel isn\u2019t the best man (who was supposed to be me and Amy\u2019s mutual friend) she will personally ruin the wedding. \n\nI dont know what to do.

It\u2019s not just your brother who\u2019s abusive, it\u2019s them too.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your mom isn\u2019t invited either. Her options are invite your brother or I\u2019ll ruin your wedding? Seems pretty clear cut to me. Your FAMILY isn\u2019t invited.", "Yes you ATA. You need to realise he has mental problems and has had it rough. He may of not been great to you, but not inviting him will probably distance him further from the family and he will read into it even moreso with his disorders.\n\nTo me, a wedding is a special day, not inviting him will taint it with this memory. If he comes and ruins it, big deal you will remember you tried for the family at your wedding and it will be a nice memory. If it goes well same as above.\n\nJust invite him, not inviting will not help him our your memory", "NTA\n\nBipolar seems to run in the family\u2026 it does in mine too, my mom and sister. \n\nYour mom threatened to ruin your wedding. Go NC. You deserve happiness and love, and to be surrounded by people who support you and love you on your wedding day.", "Mother doesn't understand the golden rule:\n\nShe didn't contribute any gold, she doesn't get to make any rules.  That's one of the many beautiful things about not taking other people's money - no reason to listen to their opinions.", "Whether your mother \u201cdeserves to be cut off from your life completely\u201d or not is entirely for you and your wife to decide. However, she has threatened to ruin your wedding so allowing her to attend is a very high-risk strategy. Security is definitely the way to go. Better a screaming fit at the entrance to the venue than inside.", "> currently cannot afford medication for the bipolar disorder.\n\nThen his disorder is uncontrolled and he's a risk. Go NC or at least uninvited them and have the wedding party alerted for your mom showing up uninvited.\n\n\nFrom someone else with severe Bipolar Type I, it took me a years for the come to Jesus moment that made me realize I need my meds to be healthy. And even more therapy and open communication with my family/friends to compensate for how I maladaptively learned to approach life with uncontrollable emotions and wild behavior when I had acute mental illness. \n\n\n\nThis statement says to me that your brother isn't doing remotely enough to be healthy and your family is still covering for it. Go get hitched without their attendance and live your best life. I don't think your family is going to come around to give you a healthy relationship.\n\n\n\nETA: NTA"]}
