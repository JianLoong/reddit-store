I have many scars and I don\u2019t trust that he won\u2019t make a scene at what is supposed to be the happiest moment of my life. \n\nAmy and I are in agreement, but my parents say I\u2019m being selfish. \n\nMy mother told me that if Daniel\u2019s not going, I will have to call off the wedding. More than that, if Daniel isn\u2019t the best man (who was supposed to be me and Amy\u2019s mutual friend) she will personally ruin the wedding. \n\nI dont know what to do.
