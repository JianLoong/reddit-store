I have many scars and I don\u2019t trust that he won\u2019t make a scene at what is supposed to be the happiest moment of my life. \n\nAmy and I are in agreement, but my parents say I\u2019m being selfish. \n\nMy mother told me that if Daniel\u2019s not going, I will have to call off the wedding. More than that, if Daniel isn\u2019t the best man (who was supposed to be me and Amy\u2019s mutual friend) she will personally ruin the wedding. \n\nI dont know what to do.

Go NC or at least uninvited them and have the wedding party alerted for your mom showing up uninvited.\n\n\nFrom someone else with severe Bipolar Type I, it took me a years for the come to Jesus moment that made me realize I need my meds to be healthy. And even more therapy and open communication with my family/friends to compensate for how I maladaptively learned to approach life with uncontrollable emotions and wild behavior when I had acute mental illness. \n\n\n\nThis statement says to me that your brother isn't doing remotely enough to be healthy and your family is still covering for it.

Don't invite your brother or your Mother.  If she threatens to ruin your wedding if you don't invite her favorite son, she doesn't deserve to attend either.

It can be difficult for people who grow up with abusive parents to understand what is and isn\u2019t acceptable and normal behavior from parents, but believe me and the other people here: YOUR MOTHER SHOULD NOT BE INVITED to a wedding she already promised to ruin.
