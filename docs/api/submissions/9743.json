As long as you don\u2019t hate TV, maybe you could watch a short show earlier in the evening, 30-60 minutes long. And then do something else, either together or apart.", "NAH - your wife is being perfectly reasonable to want to continue to spend quality time with you, although a little bit unreasonable in her inflexibility. You are being perfectly reasonable in taking are of your health. Do you have kids? Can you spend time together on the weekend watching TV, during non-bedtime-hours, and then doing other things at night as a compromise?", "NAH\n\nIt's currently 3:20 am where I am, and I'm obviously writing this comment with the help of a screen so I get the struggle.You are in no way the AH for trying to be healthier, especially when you actively tried to find a solution that would suit you both. There has to be some compromise.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to apologise for making a change in your life that feels healthy to you. You acknowledged how watching TV together is about more than just watching TV, and offered alternatives. Good luck, OP.", "NTA she doesn't get to dictate how you spend your time.\nIf you were asking her to not watch TV altogether, then you would have been the AH, but clearly you're willing to meet her halfway here by offering to read or something and she's not.\n\nMaybe you can figure out a schedule where you watch TV for 2 nights of the week and play board games for the rest?", "NTA. Most TVs these days have blue light filter settings. Sometimes it's called night mode. I have blue light filters on every screen that I use and I really think it's made a huge difference. Would this be helpful to you too?", "NTA\n\nKeep making good choices, mate!", "NAH\n\nI get that she wants to wind down, but you\u2019ve given her lots of other options so that you can spend time together. \n\nMy husband likes to watch tv before bed too, and it\u2019s not my favourite. We have had to compromise and watch tv earlier in the evening, and we spend more time together on weekend too (instead of doing our own thing separately)", "My bf got me fancy blue light glasses from this company ra and I find that they really really fucking work so you could wear blue light glasses and watch tv like 1/2 per week? I feel like I get both sides but definitely NAH", "NTA\n\nIf she is like my husband, when he is watching tv you can walk in front of him, and he won't notice unless you stand and block the view of the tv. If she is like that, tv time really has nothing to do with quality time with a partner.", "NTA - do an audio book??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When you change a routine it can be hard on a partner. Give this some time.", "NAH\nBut why don\u2019t you try blue light blocking glasses. Might be a good compromise?", "NAH.  I would suggest one thing for y\u2019all to do, but it tends to make babies and sometimes produces strange cravings in the wife, so depending on y\u2019all\u2019s desire for rugrats,it might still be something to consider.  Plus, it burns calories, lol", "NTA\n\nHow is spending hours in front of a television \"quality time\"? I'm sure a couple of words are exchanged but highly doubt real conversation is occurring.", "NTA. It\u2019s recommended that people with sleep problems don\u2019t even watch tv in the bedroom. Can she watch tv in the living room..maybe u could compromise. Tv only in the living room and maybe u could get some blue light blocking glasses and watch a little with her there.", "NAH.\n\nThere is an easy compromise here.\n\nSometimes you watch TV in bed, and sometimes you do other stuff.", "NTA she\u2018s unsupportive", "NTA.  Sounds like the tv time is more important to her than the together time.  She can set up camp in another room.", "NAH. While it stinks your wife of losing her TV partner, she could be more flexible with what y\u2019all could do instead. She could then watch TV after you go to bed.\n\nThis could be a compromise. Y\u2019all could watch a dating show y\u2019all have never seen, like one episode each night, and then have a discussion about who you liked, disliked, etc. this would give her a TV partner for like 45 minutes and you could wind down with a discussion. Quality time with stimulating engagement.", "There are also glasses that filter blue light. Now that I need reading glasses, I make sure that the pair I keep on my bedside table is a blue-light-filtering pair. That could also help.\n\nTo be fair, though, it's not always just the blue light that is the problem. My housemate likes to watch crime and detective dramas in the evenings, and sometimes, the murder plots are really quite gruesome, which is *not* the sort of thing I find restful and conducive to a good night's sleep."]}
