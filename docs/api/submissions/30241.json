My husband simply said because i don\u2019t like it but i felt comfortable enough to explain i had a bad past with it and didn\u2019t like what alcohol does and so i do not drink.

There are some people that say that what you do and say drinking is because of the alcohol, to me that\u2019s BS. What you say and do while you are drunk to any individual is what your subconscious is blocking while sober. After seeing this you should definitely not feel that any part of what she said was your fault. I would definitely avoid her at all costs.", "NTA you did nothing wrong, the Grandmother-in-law in this was drunk and in a state of 'drunken idiocy'.", "Nta she has probably been saying these things about you behind your back all along.  Go low contact.  If you don't the family will learn you are an easy target and this will happen again and again.", "NTA\n\nIt's hard and I understand it hurt you, your husband did.  \nAlcohol does not excuse any behavior or should we forgive those who become violent under the same conditions? no so that's all.", "NTA\n\nIrresponsible drinking drives me insane. If you can't control your drinking so that you don't make a fool of yourself then you shouldn't be drinking. And that whole nonsense that people use to rationalize things, where if you aren't partaking in similar bad behavior as they are, that means you're judging them, is just so wrong, but it makes perfect sense to a drunk. Avoid the grandmother at all costs. \n\nMind you, a part of me thinks you should text her back and say that her \"apology\" is not accepted and explain how it's not really an apology unless she itemizes the list of things she did to you, and apologizes in front of the people that witnessed her unacceptable behavior towards you. But don't do that, as she won't respond the way you want her to, the way a rational person should. Better to just keep your distance.", "NTA and I think you handled the situation with respect and grace. I have so much respect for your choices and behavior. You cannot argue with a drunk. Don't feel guilty for your choices; it's a toxic situation.", "NTA.  A loving grandparent is a tremendous joy and an asset to have in your life.  A drunken, asshole grandparent is worthless, and isn\u2019t worth your time or energy.  Having said that, this sounds like the first offense rather than a pattern.  Maybe it\u2019s not worth going NC yet.", "So,\n\nFirst - your response at the time was very gracious and mature.\n\nThis is family, and as you know when people drink they aren't able to hold back from speaking some things, like what happened.\n\nI think this is where you need to exercise forgiveness, she's his grandma.\n\nLooking at it from Grandma's perspective, she said what was on her mind, she felt judged while she was drinking and you weren't, you are the \"church girl\" in her eyes, young, etc. and she was telling you why she was drinking, seeking your understanding or explaining herself.  I realize she grabbed your arm.\n\nYour love and graciousness and forgiveness here could go a long way.\n\nWhy let this come between your husband and grandma, why not go ahead and let go and just forgive freely, 77x7...\n\nAlso, that will be a blessing to your husband if you just forgive.\n\nThings happen in families.\n\nFamilies need to hold strong.\n\nDon't let this ruin a relationship.\n\nYou can forgive.\n\nI know you can because your initial response was very mature and gracious.\n\nLet his grandma have a do-over.

Your grandmother has a drinking problem. That's not your problem, it's hers. People that drunk cannot be reasoned with and you are under no obligation to stay and listen to them berate you. Calmly leave if you need to but don't apologize for not being drunk with her.  Also she's an AH for insulting your need for medication.

My husband was ready to go knock on her door and demand an apology to me after he heard the whole story and i decided to send her basically \u201cYour right it wasn\u2019t.

He has no tolerance for disrespect towards me which he took it as that. She is an alcoholic who drinks because she can\u2019t control her emotions (her daughter moving across the country was the reason for her emotions). So i did forgive openly and in my heart and like i said will be friendly and civil but knowing her well enough she is to prideful to accept her drunkenness is the reason the entire thing blew up and that is why i feel i can\u2019t have a close relationship anymore to spare myself of more suffering. Additionally she has lashed out while drunk at many other family members for various reasons just like she did me. Thank you for your voice and advice"]}
