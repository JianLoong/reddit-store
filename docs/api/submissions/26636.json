Before my grandson was born i told my son and his wife that I\u2019m going to pay for all baptismal excepenses and any childcare expenses for the first year, as long as they gave the kid an orthodox name.\n\nThey both agreed without much consideration. They named him David Antoin\u00e9. David is the orthodox name and Antoin\u00e9 in honor of the uni professor who mentored both my son and his wife and who sadly passed away during the covid pandemic.\n\nThe thing is. While my daughter in law converted to orthodoxy, her parents are atheists of african origin(ivory coast) who moved to France. They really wanted they\u2019re grandson to have a traditional ivorian name.\n\nSo 2 months ago when the baby was born and they found out about the name and the deal they threw a massive fit, directed primarily at my wife and I. Name calling, cursing, accusations of racism\u2026\n\nAnd frankly I wasn\u2019t having any of it. I told them that they were insensitive and insulting to not only my religion but also that of their daughter, to their daughter\u2019s decision and to the mentor of both their daughter and my son.\n\nI told them they are uninvited to the baptism due to their behavior unless they apologize to the parents of our grandchild. Both my son and his wife agreed with my decision.\n\nThe baptism is next week and while I\u2019ve been no contact with them, my som tell\u2019s from the discussions they\u2019ve had they\u2019re still pretty angry and unwilling to apologize but they said they will come to the baptism wether i like it or not.\n\nMy sister tells me I\u2019ve been acting like an asshole towards them and I should let them join next week if they show up. I maintain that they will not be allowed at the after party.\n\nEdit: hello, this post really blew up and it\u2019s a bit overwhelming. Many people are calling me an ahole, which might be true. But i would like to clear up some things before other people make judgments based on missconceptions.\n\n1. When i said they will not be allowed at the baptism I meant at the after party which will take place at my home. Only church officials can kick people out at the ceremony itself and unless they are disruptive I don\u2019t see a reason they\u2019d be kicked out.\n\n2. My son and his wife paid for their own wedding. She converted of her own free will because it is what she believes in.\n\n3. They originally planned to name my grandchild just Antoin\u00e9. I suggested and orthodox name so that the child can have a protective saint to call upon if harsh times. But everyone will use the name Antoin\u00e9 to address him.\n\n4. My son and his wife can afford the expenses, even without my help.\n\n5. I don\u2019t want my in laws to be happy with the outcome. I just want a simple \u201csorry\u201d and for them to be civil at the party.", "created_utc": 1694425894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16fr5kw/aita_for_being_racist_to_my_inlaws/", "score": 582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Though I think her parents\u2019 reaction was terrible too, did you even think about any of this from their perspective? Their daughter lives in a different country, she converted to your religion, which I\u2019m certain was a condition of the marriage, their grandchild will also be raised in a religion not their own, yet you begrudge them wanting their culture being taken into account as well.

You are also an AH demanding that your grandchild have a name at your direction and making the payment of childcare depending on that name.

Not racist, you gave a gift with conditions. Like the government advertising e cars with financial support. Its still the parents decision and they liked the name else they would have refused. \n\nIdk the orthodox practise but its common that the godfather gives a gift to the child in catholicism and should lead him/her on the way to god.\n\n I can understand you dont like paying for people that insulted you, but its your grand childs party. Personally I wouldnt invite atheists as they have no reason to be there, they don't recognize the existence of a god, why should they come to a baptism?", "Ok, no. NTA. Look, as a pagen, I have no love for the church and its hypocrisy, but I also have friends and family that are orthodox. This is a common cultural practice. The grandparents on one side are doing something that has been done in many Catholic communities for years. They didn't pick the name, only said it had to be orthodox, and going by the description of events, the child was going to be baptized anyway. Yes, the money does make it feel gross to those on the outside, but it's seen as a you honor the family tradition, and we will make sure all needs are met. The aholes here are the wife's parents. They demanded the right to name the baby, which is ultimately the decision of the parents. They also assumed the daughter would go with a name they would like. If they found out about the name when the kid was born, then clearly they didn't care to ask beforehand. Also, claiming racism because they dont like a traditional practice their daughter agreed to and the fact that the kids are agreeing with him as far as not inviting them speaks volumes. So clearly, one set of grandparents is more involved here than the other. The son and daughter were not told what to name the kid by this guy, only asked to stay within a naming convention. I have a feeling that a lot of the people saying that op is the ahole here have their own gripes with religion and are protecting that onto this situation.\n\nEdit: Also, to those claiming the daughter was forced to convert or was forced to accept this, you are undermining the autonomy of this young woman. I can guarantee she wouldn't have converted if she didn't believe. Catholicism is a lot harder to join than, say, American rust belt Christianity. While related, the two religious beliefs have many different ideas on how people should come to the church.", "YTA for trying to control what they named their child. I stopped reading after that, because screw you buddy.", "Absolutely the AH! And a massive one at that. You bribed them! Surely that must be against your religion, no???? I know this will be controversial, but in my opinion and personal experience, sometimes religious people are the worse. They have no scruples and you are a good example of it!!! Shame on you!", "You are paying for the baptism and the expenses in exchange for the child being named like you wanted. That's done. You shouldn't be the one still waving the money-card around demanding they don't come to the baptism or don't participate for things you paid because you paid them for the name.

It seems strange that your DIL's parents made that accusation purely because of the name. However since you are telling the story you may be leaving something out that explains their accusation. I don't have enough info.\n\nBased purely on the facts presented here, nobody comes off well. You suck for using your money to exert a level of control that you have no gd right to. Your son and his wife suck for accepting your control and for apparently never explaining their choice and their reasoning to her family. They seem cowardly, which is usually the outcome of overbearing parents, so no surprise. Her parents suck for talking with you instead of the actual parents, who made the decision to accept your offer. They also suck for apparently reacting very hotly. You suck for responding in kind, and then for claiming even more authority that does not belong to you, as only the parents can choose guests of a baptism. Your son and DIL also suck for apparently accepting your further intrusions.\n\nThe only person in this circumstance is a poor baby with cowardly, immature, browbeaten parents, control freaks for grandparents and constant familial strife around him, as not a single person in his family cares more about him than their own petty wants and grievances.", "Well, I can see that your family has a strong religious foundation. The offer of paying for childcare for a year was kind as well but should not have been tied to the name and baptism as it's bribery with the intent of pushing her culture aside . Your DIL is from another culture, despite having become Orthodox, and that culture should definitely be reflected in the child's name by the addition of a third name from her side (my siblings and I all have 4 given names).Her culture does not cease to exist because she married your son.  Excluding her parents from the baptism is also discriminatory, and you need to open the doors and invite them in as they are family, and their culture deserves as much respect as yours does.", "YTA There's no part of this where you aren't a slimy AH.

OP absolutely sounds like an asshole, but this absolutely is not coercion. It may not be a truly free choice, as few are, but if you googled the definition you\u2019d see that bribery, while manipulation, does not generally rise to the level of coercion. \n\nIf someone is threatened to do something it\u2019s absolutely a different situation, but if an offer is made that you do something in exchange for something else, assuming there\u2019s no extreme situation where saying no would cause severe hardship, then you are responsible for accepting that. It\u2019s good that people are being more understanding of situations where someone isn\u2019t responsible for a bad decision because of the actions of others, but people seem to have trouble drawing the line between that and willingly doing something they wouldn\u2019t otherwise do if there wasn\u2019t a transactional arrangement. Sometimes that can rise to the level of coercion, but more often it is a true choice where options are weighed and either the exchange is worth it or it\u2019s not.
