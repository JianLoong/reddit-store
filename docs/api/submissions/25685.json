If nothing happened while you and ur late wife were together than theres nothing wrong with it. Lots of ppl bond thru grief its fairly common. Some ppl may not like it but they opinion isnt whats important. Whats important is that it makes you 2 happy. live your best life and congrats on finding love again.", "NTA.\n\nIf there is an afterlife, your wife is probably looking down happy that the two people she cares most about found each other.", "NTA - Helene and you found each romantically by chance.  We never know when we will find love again especially after such a tragic loss.  It is no way  betraying the memory of your late wide, actually it enhances it in a way as it is with someone she also cared about.  No one can replace your late wife but I think she would approve that the two of you found the capacity to carryon without her.  And that is all that matters.", "Important piece of info missing. Is Helene still married? If yes, then ofc your the asshole. If not, then personally, I don't see much of a problem.", "NTA, I think this is actually quite a \"common\" phenomenon. You guys have a pretty powerful thing in common.\n\nI'd make sure you've had some therapy to ensure you aren't trauma bonding, but it's been 5 years so I think it's fine.", "NTA, \n\nI don't see much of a problem here. You deserve to be happy too. You can't be grieving forever. I think Natalie wouldn't want that. I hope you guys live happily.", "lots of people will be judgemental but at the end of the day, you deserve to be happy and whoever that person is so long as you take care of your children it's okay\n\nYour Children > Your Spouse > You >>>>>>>>> Everyone else.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t say this is super common but it\u2019s also probably not uncommon. I happen to know someone who did the exact same thing. All deserve to be happy and not inappropriate at all. Live your life and tell those who have an opinion to get lost.", "It's hard to say you've said how your parents/ friends feel about it, but how does your son feel? That would be more of an indicator, and how would your late wife feel? I assume she would want you to be happy.", "NTA, \n\nYou deserve to be happy and if they were best friends then she wouldnt be threatened by you holding your late wife in high regard because she probably does too, everyone giving you a hard time just cant move on and Misery loves company although I would cut your late wifes parents some slack because no parents want to outlive thier children.", "INFO. Is Helene still married?", "YWNBTA.  Sorry they are being an AH to you. It's been three years... are you supposed to be alone forever?? Also it doesn't sound like this was the long con to get to your  late wife's best friend. Just happened naturally through no fault of either of you. \n\nBe happy and love who you want to. I'm fairly sure your wife would be happy for you both.", "NTA.  It's nice that you found someone who will share in your love for your deceased wife.

You are allowed to move forward. I don\u2019t think this betrays your late wife in any way.  In fact, I would think that if she knew you were moving forward with your life, she\u2019d be glad it was with someone she also loved, especially since this affects your son as well.", "NTA. It's been three years, not three days.", "NTA \n\nYou know as well as anyone that those we love can be gone in an instant. When Natalie was alive you loved her. She knew that every day she was with you. Then you lost Natalie and struggled. Thankfully you had your son. You both grieved and worked to recover.\n\nYou are allowed to move on and love again. The best part is that it\u2019s someone that knew and loved  Natalie too. That means that both of you can tell your son stories about his Mom. Helene understands that the memory of Natalie doesn\u2019t take anything from your relationship together but adds to it. \n\nGive everyone else time, hopefully they\u2019ll realize that your happy and the two of you belong together.", "The only way for your wife\u2019s parents to be happy would be for you the remain a shattered widower for the rest of your life as you faithful turn your life into a memorial. You didn\u2019t cheat on her.  You stayed by her and mourned her for three years after her death. It is okay to move on with life. I wish you all the happiness, laughter and great adventures that life can bring you and your new bride. You sound like a good man and loving husband.

I get why people are upset, but that\u2019s just because they are also still grieving. It doesn\u2019t sound like you and Helene did anything wrong.", "NTA a minimal grieving period is 1-2 years.

I\u2019m terribly sorry for the loss you both experienced, and hope that being together brings you peace. NTA.", "NTA.  I am married to my late husband\u2019s best friend (we were all friends).  It started similarly.  At a bonfire with lots of other friends.  Kind of a whole to us both, to be honest.  We never felt that way about each other till that moment.  We had grieved our loss together but we\u2019re still just friends before that.  We are happily married and have been for many years now.  There is nothing wrong with loving someone after a loss.", "NTA", "Well said.", "Ofcourse not she divorced.", "No, she divorced.", "Grow up.

This didn\u2019t happen the week after your wife\u2019s passing. You both lost someone you loved or cared deeply for. She was there for you in the aftermath of your wife\u2019s death.

You just need to want it.", "You wrote this entire post and only mentioned once in passing that you have a son with your late wife. Well, what about him?

If so, what does he think about it?", "The only people that have a say in this is you, Helena and Natalie. It's nobody else's business. \n\nYou and Helena are consenting adults. \nUnless your late spesficly told she would be against it, you can only assume she'd be okay with it, and I can't see how this is \"disrespecting her memory\" you still respect and remember her, regardless of your relationship status.

You found love years after your wife\u2019s passing and it is likely the memory of your wife that helped to bond you two together. That\u2019s a thing of beauty after tragedy, not something to be ashamed of.", "NTA\n\nIn any way, shape or form. You and Helene found one another organically and honestly. \n\nI wish you a long, beautiful life together. Your love for Helene and Natalie can coexist; amazing how much love and grief our hearts can simultaneously hold.", "YTA.\n\nNever marry again after being widowed. You are indeed betraying the memory of your late wife by doing this. Horrible...", "INFO have either of you been to grief counseling? Lots of people bond over shared grief. Sometimes those relationships last, sometimes they are just based on the grief so when one person processes their grief the relationship ends. How old is your child and how do they feel about this? As a child, I would feel it was a betrayal of my mother from both of you because kids don't really understand the psychology behind it all. I think you really need to spend a long time in this relationship before you get married, make sure you have both been through grief counseling and make sure your child is ok with it. Otherwise there are 8 billion other people on this planet.", "Yeah but was her realtionship with you the reason for the divorce.", "Because of you?"]}
