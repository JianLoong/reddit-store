I have been through this like EXACT situation myself with a long-term friend. I am sorry that you have been going through this, but also I am relieved to have someone else share experiencing this and seeing the comments. My friend would consistently make comments on \"abnormal\" things that I did and labeled them as autism constantly. Or even when I was just doing things that I just enjoyed / was being myself, it seemed he would knock me down a peg by calling what I was doing an autistic trait and it would make me stop and feel so insecure. When I would bring this up, he would turn it on me by calling me ableist for being offended by that. As someone who has worked with people on the spectrum for years and being a mental health worker myself, I was pretty sure I knew myself and the information on this but began questioning myself all the time. I also began to feel guilty because of my work with people on the spectrum, because I did not want to be potentially ableist related to the people I work with. Of course, I do not believe there is inherent badness for being autistic, but I was upsetting for me to be called it all the time and feeling belittled. But I was being called an ableist for vocalizing any of these feelings. Also, I have complex trauma (symptoms of that can actually look like a lot of other diagnoses, autism included), depression and other mental health issues and I have been in therapy for years as well, and autism never came up for me as well. I even had a psychologist at the time of this happening that would literally be like no thats not a concern for me. All of this to say, I am not sure of what your overall relationship with this person looks like but what I can say that for my own friend, I began looking at the overall relationship and ways he has historically belittled me and crossed my boundaries over and over, I realized this was just one of his methods to put me down, and other people around me validated and told me they observed this too. My question is, does she cross other boundaries and how does she overall treat you? For my own case, I realized that my friend is so mean to me, treats me poorly, and does such self-centered things in relation to others.

Whilst you appreciate her concern, you're not interested in discussing it any further. Your mental health is a conversation between you, your doctor, your therapist and no one else. Let her know that if she continues to bring it up then you'll have no choice but to spend less time with her.", "NTA - Honestly, this all sounds perfectly normal. I don't know what your friend is talking about.", "Nta. Although I was in similiar boat being seen by therapist and psychiatrist for decades and never mentioned or brought it up. Wasn\u2019t till I actually researched did I learn I was actually Autistic. Not saying you are just saying a lot of therapist and psychiatrist are not great at recognizing it.

Autistic people just have a much lower tolerance. Autistic behavior markers are also common in neurotypical people. NTs stim (bouncing toes, clicking pens, etc) NT people have sensory limitations (nails on a chalk board, slimy textures) NT people also have \u201csafe foods\u201d that are easy to cook and eat. \n\nThe difference between NT behaviors and autistic behaviors is frequency, intensity, and mentality around those behaviors. Clubs are loud and noisy and overwhelming for MANY people but that\u2019s entirely different from my having a mini panic attack in a conference room where 3 other people are talking to each other while I am trying to work. Some people like to eat the same lunch everyday because it\u2019s easy and cheap. I go through bouts of ONLY eating certain foods because sometimes I literally do not know how I will respond to certain textures and it\u2019s just easier for me to make a decision.

They know it clearly bothers you but still feel the need to diagnose you with all that knowledge they think they have. As you said yourself, being in contact with professionals who have never brought this up to you means she probably doesn't know what she is talking about. Shocker. The fact she is not respecting how you feel about this just makes her seem super judgemental about your feelings and choices and a kind of crappy friend. Have you sat her down and told her how much this bothers you and reminded her that social media does not equate to a medical degree? It doesn't even seem like she is genuinely concerned about you more about being right with her opinion. \nAlso depression and anxiety really suck and having friends constantly pick on you for your behaviour really sucks too. Don't let it get you down.", "NTA. But that doesn\u2019t mean she might not be right.", "NTA. She isn't a therapist AND you haven't asked for her opinion.  She needs a big dose of None-YA!

Diagnosed and everything. And nothing you've said screams autism. \n\nThe signs - sensory issues, sticking to routine, etc - need to be present from childhood for a diagnosis. And unless you always stuck to a routine as a kid, unless you refused to try new foods or do new things, unless you had sensory issues from things being too loud or too bright, it would be really hard for a psychiatrist to diagnose you.\n\nAnd your friend isn't a psychiatrist.\n\nWhen I have suspicions that someone I know has autism or ADHD, I will essentially tell them that here are the signs as I see them in you, here are those signs as I feel them in me, if you relate to what I feel then it's a possibility, but in no way a definite. If that is a possibility you want to explore more, then I am happy to help. If it's not a possibility, I drop it forever or until they bring it up again. I tell them the signs in case they don't know, because I didn't know until someone brought up ADHD to me and it really helped me.\n\nTrying to force a label on someone who doesn't want it, regardless of whether you're autistic or not, isn't helpful. And a label like autism isn't helpful, it's one you can't get rid of (as in there isn't a diagnosis that really overrides it, or a reason for it to come off your medical records), comes with a lot of stigma, and it can feel quite isolating.\n\nThere are positives to being autistic. It's not something to be ashamed of.\n\nBut if you aren't autistic, then you aren't autistic. There's no shame in that either.\n\nWhat is shameful is your friend trying to diagnose you with no medical background. Self diagnosis is valid. But this isn't self diagnosis.\n\nAlso I have never had someone in my life ask someone if they're autistic as a compliment. Even if they follow it up with \"there's nothing wrong with being autistic\". Because they are trying to highlight that you do something weird or different and they think it's odd. It's never a \"are you autistic because you just seem so creative\". It's always a \"are you autistic because you're doing something odd\"\n\nIs she autistic herself? I only wonder because when I first got diagnosed I desperately tried to find signs of it in other people so I wouldn't feel alone. I wonder if she is doing the same thing. If she's not autistic, then she can take her lack of knowledge of autism and gtfo. Sensory issues can come from ADHD (among other things), adherence to routine can come from OCD (among other things), insomnia can come from bipolar (among many other things), so jumping to autism seems odd to me.", "I've had a coworker I used to be friendly with try to insinuate I'm autistic. I brought it up with my therapist and he said \"not any more or less autistic than the average person\", laughed, and we moved on.

The doctor assured her there wasn\u2019t.  I still basically eat like a toddler and usually eat the same foods for most meals.  I like routine because there was some chaos in my family life when I was much younger.  I assure you that I am not autistic.  The reason I say you\u2019re a better person is that I would have cracked a long time ago and cussed her out.

I can't see anyone being able to sleep on a couch comfortably especially if they are used to a bigger bed and a good mattress that is completely understandable for anyone.

Many psychologists don't diagnose, but admister psychotherapy treatment and have knowledge about various diagnoses to provide better care.

They make diagnoses and prescribe treatment. In theory, they can also provide therapy, but there\u2019s such a giant shortage of psychiatrists that you generally only see them in the diagnose/prescribe role, unless they\u2019re providing care in a specialized institution. \n\nPsychologist- Advanced degree in psychology and, if they have clinical training, can provide therapy. Some limited ability to diagnose, but cannot prescribe.\n\nNeurologist- A doctor who specializes in brain conditions (what happens when your brain does certain things and how it reacts to certain stimuli). \n\n-> Source: I\u2019m an epidemiologist and I\u2019ve worked with/received training from individuals in all of these categories at one point or another. :)", "I was tested as an adult.

The only surprise I got was how crazy good I was at remembering sequences/patterns and even doing them in reverse. So it wasn't like I was lying in a chair at any time.

Psychologists can be therapists, but they also have additional training in assessment, diagnostics, etc. In most states, you have to have a doctorate to be a psychologist. In a very few states, you can do these things independently as a  master\u2019s level psychologist.", "Hi, I'm a clinical psychologist. We do not have a \"limited ability\" to diagnose. Psychological assessment, including DSM diagnosis, educational testing, IQ testing, personality testing and neuropsych testing, is firmly in the professional wheelhouse of psychologists. Although not all clinical psychologists end up specializing in comprehensive psychological assessment, which may include a clinical interview, testing, self-report and confederate report questionnaires, observation, review of records, and preparing a detailed written report, we all have training in it.  \n\nWe are also trained in DSM diagnosis. Emphasis can vary depending on the doctoral program, but in my graduate program faculty were involved in research on classification of anxiety disorders; grad students conducted 4-hour long semi-structured interviews to gather data for that purpose. I also served as a phone interviewer on a national epidemiological study following up on cases where a diagnosis of OCD couldn't be determined by the initial interviewer.\n\nThe best way to obtain an accurate diagnosis of autism or ADHD is to see a psychologist/neuropsychologist specializing in this area who will synthesize multiple forms of data to make a differential diagnosis (e.g., is it autism as opposed to social anxiety as opposed to schizoid personality as opposed to a neuropsychological deficit, a different developmental condition, etc.)"]}
