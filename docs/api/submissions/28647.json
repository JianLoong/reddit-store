I have been through this like EXACT situation myself with a long-term friend. I am sorry that you have been going through this, but also I am relieved to have someone else share experiencing this and seeing the comments. My friend would consistently make comments on \"abnormal\" things that I did and labeled them as autism constantly. Or even when I was just doing things that I just enjoyed / was being myself, it seemed he would knock me down a peg by calling what I was doing an autistic trait and it would make me stop and feel so insecure. When I would bring this up, he would turn it on me by calling me ableist for being offended by that. As someone who has worked with people on the spectrum for years and being a mental health worker myself, I was pretty sure I knew myself and the information on this but began questioning myself all the time. I also began to feel guilty because of my work with people on the spectrum, because I did not want to be potentially ableist related to the people I work with. Of course, I do not believe there is inherent badness for being autistic, but I was upsetting for me to be called it all the time and feeling belittled. But I was being called an ableist for vocalizing any of these feelings. Also, I have complex trauma (symptoms of that can actually look like a lot of other diagnoses, autism included), depression and other mental health issues and I have been in therapy for years as well, and autism never came up for me as well. I even had a psychologist at the time of this happening that would literally be like no thats not a concern for me. All of this to say, I am not sure of what your overall relationship with this person looks like but what I can say that for my own friend, I began looking at the overall relationship and ways he has historically belittled me and crossed my boundaries over and over, I realized this was just one of his methods to put me down, and other people around me validated and told me they observed this too. My question is, does she cross other boundaries and how does she overall treat you? For my own case, I realized that my friend is so mean to me, treats me poorly, and does such self-centered things in relation to others.

You might not like talking to folks you don't know well, but unless your communication is inhibited by developmental delay and/or impairment its not autism. Yes a developmental specialist, neurologist, or a psychiatrist needs to diagnose you. Your therapist isn't qualified.", "Psychiatrist: Mostly gives medication. Has way fewer hours of Psychology Class/Training, doesn't usually do long term Therapy.\nPsychologist: Has over 80 hours of Psychology Classes/Training, deals with more of the feelings and Therapy side of things, restricted on what meds they can give.\nNeurologist: Medical professionals that deal with illness of the brain(Stroke, Alzheimer's, Etc.) And not usually psychological illnesses.", "Psychologists definitely do diagnose. You may be confusing a psychologist with a psychotherapist/counsellor", "Clinical neuropsychologist focus on diagnosing autism, learning disabilities, ADHD, dementia types, etc.", "Actually most Neurologist's.*Do* prescribe medications. For example my husband's Neurologist, prescribes him, his Dilantin.", "Neuropsychologist do comprehensive testing to diagnose autism and other neurological conditions.\n\nEdit: psychiatrist focus more on mental health issues. Autism is a neurological disability not a mental health issue. So you\u2019re right they are more treatment after diagnosis in the case of autism. They even refer patient for evaluation to help them treat a patient.", "Groan, that copied down somehow from the psychologist definition. I know neurologists prescribe medications. Mine is fixing my migraines and I am thrilled about it."]}
