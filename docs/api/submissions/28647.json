I find it deeply offensive and annoying. If you bring it up again then I'm going have to re-evaluate our friendship. This is a deal breaker for me so I ask that you respect the boundary I am making with you now'.\n\nDo not argue, apologise, explain, defend or justify. Do not allow her to pull you into any discussion around this. If she tries, then repeat your boundary and keep repeating it.\n\nBoundaries don't just get our needs met, they're also an indication of who gets access to our precious energy. A good friend will accept them without question. A bad friend will rail against them or worse, deride us for them.\n\nYou're giving her this boundary so she may have an opportunity to stay in your life.

For example, we know from recent studies that things like 'stimming', sensitivities, strong interests are found at high rates in people who are NOT autistic.  Is your friend all over the dodgy online 'autism' tests?\n\nSo-called \u201cautism\u201d tests, like AQ and RAADS and others have high rates of false positives, labeling you as autistic VERY easily. If anyone with a mental health problem, like depression or anxiety, takes the tests they score high even if they DON\u2019T have autism. \r  \nHere is a video explaining ONE study about the RAADs:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticPride/comments/zfocf8/for\\_all\\_the\\_selfdiagnosersquestioners\\_out\\_there/\r  \n\r  \nRegarding AQ, from one published study.  \u201cThe two key findings of the review are that, overall, there is very limited evidence to support the use of structured questionnaires (SQs: self-report or informant completed brief measures developed to screen for ASD) in the assessment and diagnosis of ASD in adults.\u201d\r  \nRegarding RAADS, from one published study.  \u201cIn conclusion, used as a self-report measure pre-full diagnostic assessment, the RAADS-R lacks predictive validity and is not a suitable screening tool for adults awaiting autism assessments\u201d", "NTA - I'm guessing that shes watching videos of people who say normal every day things are a trait of autism.", "NTA\n\nBut is she on the spectrum? \n\nSomeone who is obsessed with seeing traits in others could be questioning if they need a diagnosis themselves. \n\nWomen manifest very differently to men and often get diagnosed very late if at all.\n\nThis could all be nothing to do with you, this could be a fixation due to her own concerns about her own neurodivergence. She likes you, you're her friend and if you're on the ASD spectrum (her subliminal reasoning) maybe it's okay if she is too??\n\nI get that she's annoying but this is just one possible reason why she's like this", "She's not a friend.

I would start limiting my time with her. Learn to switch her off in your brain when she goes on these crazy tangents. Talk to your therapist.", "NTA. Tell her that she needs to get off of the internet until social media gives her the medical degree she thinks she has.\n\nIdk how you stayed friends because she would've got told off ages ago...", "NTA. You're not autistic. She's one of a mob if folks who are chronically online and who have turned a developmental disability into a quirky personality trait so they can co-opt it at the expense of actually autistic folks. You can and should firmly tell her you are not autistic and she is not an expert so she's not fit to diagnose people. You can also tell her that her continued insistence that she can label you is impacting your relationship and if she won't stop then you will stop seeing her, but that's a boundary you'll need to determine yourself.", "NTA, although kind of misleading title: you're not annoyed that she thinks you're autistic, you're annoyed because she keeps bringing it up even after you've asked her to stop doing it. Like, she won't listen to you and is just insisting on her expounding her own theories on how your brain works, repeatedly. It's boundary ignoring, and it'd annoy anyone.", "Everyone wants to classify everything as autism and it honestly hurts people who are truly autistic the most. Not everything is autistic.", "NTA.  Tell her,  \"there is nothing wrong with not being autistic, but there is something wrong with diagnosing someone with a medical issue without being licensed to diagnose people.  Not one professional has ever said I am autistic, so quite diagnosing me with zero qualifications.\"  What you describe are normal preferences and routines almost everyone has to some point in their life.

You aren\u2019t eating the same meal because you are sensitive to other food textures, you eat it because it\u2019s cheap, somewhat healthy, and convenient. Stepping out of a club for some air is normal, especially if you\u2019re prone to headaches. \n\nYour behaviors aren\u2019t comforting to you, they\u2019re just logical.
