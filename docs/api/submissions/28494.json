The bride already said yes and changing after the group photos are done is the perfect time to switch outfits. That way, OP's outfit will be consistent throughout the \"party\" portion of the photos, instead of changing halfway through (granted I'm thinking about this as a photographer, so that's my preference). \n\nAlso, if OP's dress had gotten dirty, or a drink spilled on it or something, she would just go change and no one would think twice. Why is it a big deal that she's asking about it in advance?", "How much time do you actually save by not writing out \u201cyou\u201d, \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re\u201c?", ">You are capable of  being uncomfortable for a few hours.\n\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of autism.  Being autistic means literally having a brain that is physically structured differently to the majority of people.  One of the ways in which our brains differ is the way we process sensory input.  Our brains literally do not filter sensory input in the same way other people's do.  \n\nWhile all autistic people and our sensory needs are different, it sounds like being uncomfortable for hours means leaving the OP emotionally dysregulated to the point where her brain will go into 'fight or flight' mode and she will reach an autistic crisis point (meltdown, shutdown or elopement).  This is not a choice she is making, it is something that will happen to her against her will.  These crisis points are literally neurological events in the brain, over which we have no control.\n\nForcing her into that situation because of aesthetics would be incredibly cruel and self-centred, and your post reeks of ableism.  It would be like telling someone with a physical disability that they knew they'd have to stand for a wedding and so them wanting to use their wheelchair is 'a huge red flag'.", "Wow.

Arghhhh... I wasn't even six before I absolutely refused to wear dresses. My parents never figured out why I refused to wear dresses, but I did eventually connect the dots myself as an adult. \n\nI'm just going to guess that sensory issues with clothes are like wearing something that makes you terribly uncomfortable and itchy.
