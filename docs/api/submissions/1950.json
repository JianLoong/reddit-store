Up until 2020 they lived a few minutes away from us and he would spend at least one weekend a month at their house. During the quarantine they decided to just retire and bought a RV and have traveled the country (we live in the US) for a year and a half. They didn\u2019t see my son very often during that time but did get him for a few weekends when they were close by. \n\nI\u2019ve had no problem driving him a few hours to visit with them. The last time this happened was over the summer and I drove on a Friday 3 hours to drop him off and then on Sunday another 3 hours picking him up. My MIL is the type of personality that things need to be done her way or she will cancel the whole thing. I know this about her and do my best to accommodate what she wants so my son doesn\u2019t have to forgo time with his grandparents. \n\nMy problem is they recently bought a house 5 hours away from us and want him to spend a long weekend with them over the break. They asked for him to come up (we\u2019d meet half way) the weekend before we are planning to vacation as a family up there. So basically they want me to drive him up on a Friday, pick him back up on Tuesday, and then my family will get back in the car that following Saturday for a vacation to visit family about 30 minutes from where they live. I\u2019ve explained this to her and that\u2019s when she asked if we can just meet halfway so I\u2019m not doing the entire drive 3 times in one week. But that\u2019s still a lot of driving for both me and my son.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish and should just do it so he can have a fun one on one trip or if I need to put my foot down and say you can have him for a spend the night when we\u2019re up there. My husband thinks I need to tell her no but he also doesn\u2019t have the best relationship with his mom.\n\nEDIT: The reason they can\u2019t keep him for the whole week is because it\u2019s my step kid\u2019s (14n/b) birthday that Wednesday and I want him home for that. I thought they\u2019d be coming down for the family dinner anyway but that\u2019s when she suggested picking him up Tuesday. So originally I was going to meet half way on Friday and thought they\u2019d drive him home Wednesday for the birthday. This is their grandchild so I\u2019m not sure why they aren\u2019t coming for their birthday but that\u2019s a whole other issue my husband is dealing with. \n\nThank you for helping me not feel like an AH and I\u2019m going to tell my husband to talk to his parents.", "created_utc": 1668083168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrdeu4/wibta_if_i_told_my_mil_she_cant_have_my_son_over/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your reason is very valid and it\u2019s not like you said 5 hours is too far i won\u2019t take him ever, it\u2019s just too much with the vacation coming up. The least MIL can do is drive the 5 hours herself.", "NTA - but you need to tell her No.\n\nThis doesn't work for you or your family. It's not that YOU'RE doing a lot of driving, your 6 year old is sitting in a car for half a day a few times in a week!\n\nYou're already going up there, they will already be spending time with him. What they are asking for is 20 hours of EXTRA driving where your son is locked in a car, whether it's theirs or yours. That's no fun for an adult, much less a 6 year old. \n\nDon't put him through that. They will see him on Saturday. Their \"drive up Friday and pick him up Tuesday and then you all return Saturday\" is unreasonable and frankly selfish.", "NTA", "NTA. If they want to see him they will work it out but you driving 15 hrs in a week to play to their desires is not ok.", "NTA.", "NTA - First point, your husband should tell his mother no, that argument shouldn't be your responsibility. Second point, why can't she do all of the driving if she's retired? That's an exhausting amount of driving. Third point, why can't she plan it around the time you'll be 30min away if she knows that's being planned anyway?", "NTA\n\nThey're recently retired, they should be doing the donkey work to travel around. They've got an RV, they can get in it, drive to you and pick your son up then go stay somewhere near you and drop him off at the end of the weekend.", "NTA this is far from selfish on your side.\n\nThey are asking too much. Simple as that. Tell them they can come to your place for a visit. It's the same distance.", "nta", "NTA\n\nPut your foot down and tell them no, that it's too much driving for you and your son. You're already going up there anyway, they can wait. They made the decision to move far away, so that means they don't just get him any time they want anymore.", "NTA \nYou get to have limits on what you can and can\u2019t manage.", "NTA.  Why can\u2019t they have him for that entire week, Friday through to the following Saturday?  That way they get a nice long time with your son and you only make the drive twice.", "NTA tell her no he can spend a night when you are up there. Husband should do this since it\u2019s his mother. If they really want him for extended time they can drive down and pick him up 2 or 3 days before your planned trip. Then you can get him while there visiting. If she doesn\u2019t want to do that they get 1 night during visit.", "Can\u2019t you just meet one way a few days before you visit and then pick him up when you visit? The compromise seems apparent, if she doesn\u2019t want to compromise then she can see him when you visit.", "NTA, especially considering your partner knows their mother better than you do, I'd trust their guidance here and put the foot down.\n\nUnless your kid is super excited about hanging with the GPs, I can't imagine it's worth ten hours driving. If it suits, when you're up there anyway you could perhaps drop him off for a sleepover on a night (/s) where you and other adults want to have a few drinks, you could then meet up with them for lunch the next day etc. And they'll have had a decent chunk of time with your kid, without it costing the petrol money etc.", "NTA and what your husband should be saying is that *he* needs to tell his mom no.", "That's so much driving it's exhausting. They are already going to see you guys when you are up there for family vacation, right? NTA", "NTA.\n\nI'd probably be willing to compromise (meet half-way on maybe the Wednesday/Thursday to drop him off, then pick him up when you're on the planned family vacation nearby the next weekend), but 10 extra hours of driving is a lot. It's not selfish on your part to not want to give up that much time, it's selfish on her part to expect it of you.\n\nShe can either learn to compromise and respect others' time and plans, or she can deal with the consequences of refusing.", "NTA if you don't want to drive that far, don't do it.", "NTA look at subreddit justnomil \nI think you need advice more then you need judgment. You need to grow a shiny spine and put down boundaries. If they want to see your son they should be putting in majority of the work. They decided to move not you.", "Nta they chose to move away.  Grandparents 5 hours away have a different relationship than grandparents 5 minutes away.  They can come visit on break, he can try ONE overnight to see how he handles it.", "NTA\n\n\n\nNo.\n\nPlease use this word. You need it in your life.", "NTA - It is time to start setting boundaries with your MIL. I know you want your son to have a relationship with his grandparents, but it cannot always be on their terms or not at all. \n\nI am also a little concerned about why they are demanding so much time with your son yet making no effort to see step kid, even on their birthday. If that is in any way about SK not living up to their expectations or not being willing to always do things their way, then I would pump the breaks on your son's relationship with MIL. If she is the type to drop her affection for him the minute he does something she doesn't like, then do not set him up for that abandonment.", "NTA and why don't they have the 14 year oldest birthday on the weekend? The younger one could stay the entire week with them. Also why don't they want their older grandchild?", "You're already going up there, they will already be spending time with him. What they are asking for is 20 hours of EXTRA driving where your son is locked in a car, whether it's theirs or yours?", "One possible answer is for him to stay longer with the grandparents. So they meet halfway as agreed but he then stays there until the family holiday and is picked up by parents then. It's one solution but OP is definitely NTA", "This. Far and away the more sensible plan.", "Well, it would only be 10hrs if they sent him up early and met up with him on the family vacation. If they're retired and he's available, surely they could come pick him up during the week instead of waiting for the weekend. This alternative also heavily depends on how they feel about him being away for so long- don't want him too burned out to enjoy the family vacation.", "/u/Hot_Tomatill is a comment-stealing bot.
