Your reason is very valid and it\u2019s not like you said 5 hours is too far i won\u2019t take him ever, it\u2019s just too much with the vacation coming up. The least MIL can do is drive the 5 hours herself.", "NTA - but you need to tell her No.\n\nThis doesn't work for you or your family. It's not that YOU'RE doing a lot of driving, your 6 year old is sitting in a car for half a day a few times in a week!\n\nYou're already going up there, they will already be spending time with him. What they are asking for is 20 hours of EXTRA driving where your son is locked in a car, whether it's theirs or yours. That's no fun for an adult, much less a 6 year old. \n\nDon't put him through that. They will see him on Saturday. Their \"drive up Friday and pick him up Tuesday and then you all return Saturday\" is unreasonable and frankly selfish.", "NTA", "NTA. If they want to see him they will work it out but you driving 15 hrs in a week to play to their desires is not ok.", "NTA.", "NTA - First point, your husband should tell his mother no, that argument shouldn't be your responsibility. Second point, why can't she do all of the driving if she's retired? That's an exhausting amount of driving. Third point, why can't she plan it around the time you'll be 30min away if she knows that's being planned anyway?", "NTA\n\nThey're recently retired, they should be doing the donkey work to travel around. They've got an RV, they can get in it, drive to you and pick your son up then go stay somewhere near you and drop him off at the end of the weekend.", "NTA this is far from selfish on your side.\n\nThey are asking too much. Simple as that. Tell them they can come to your place for a visit. It's the same distance.", "nta", "NTA\n\nPut your foot down and tell them no, that it's too much driving for you and your son. You're already going up there anyway, they can wait. They made the decision to move far away, so that means they don't just get him any time they want anymore.", "NTA \nYou get to have limits on what you can and can\u2019t manage.", "NTA.  Why can\u2019t they have him for that entire week, Friday through to the following Saturday?  That way they get a nice long time with your son and you only make the drive twice."]}
