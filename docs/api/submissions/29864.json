Emergencies and potentially serious health issues trump most other things.\n\nBeyond that, you're right to be upset that you've been given all of your father's parental duties while your mother spirals into depression. Please reach out to your father, and any aunts, uncles, grandparents and close friends of the family. Ask them for help. Your mother may be upset that you're airing the family's dirty laundry, but if she can't reach out for help then ultimately you're doing her a favour too.\n\nYou shouldn't need to be a parent at this point in your life. You should be learning who you are and what you like. You should be hanging out with friends and playing in sports or whatever it is that you love. If you're working it should be so that you can buy stuff you want not because it's the only way your family will have food. (The economic reality is that for many families the supplemental income their older children can provide is essential to keeping everyone going, but this is not ideal.)\n\nIt may be that none of your relatives will be willing or able to bring material change to your lives.

Can you contact your dad and maybe live with him for a while? Mom needs to get herself together and get some therapy.", "NTA - try to minimize your sister's exposure to this situation since she's so young (you are so young too!). \n\nDo you speak to your father? It sounds like your mom is very depressed and may not be fit to take care of an 11yr old. If your father is a good dude, you may want to call him and explain your concerns and ask him to take a more active role in your sister's life.", "Unfortunately, you have to keep helping your sister she's only a child so it's not fair on her if no one is helping her.  \n\nHowever, you are not an arsehole for telling your mum this isn't fair on you because it's not fair on you. (As long as you aren't telling your sister that) Also, trying to get your mum to go seek help is the right thing. She's not listening probably because of the depression/ greif. There are support groups for people coping with family who are going through this kind of thing, maybe try seek one out it could help you facing it. Also try using the word grief instead of depression when telling her to get help. It's likely this was triggered by the grief of the loss of the relationship, it might be an easier word for her to accept. \n\nAlso there are ways you can try and lessen the load on yourself. Firstly what is the custody situation? Make sure your dad is chipping in where possible and ask for help from other family members, maybe grandma can babysit every now and then so you can get a break. And teach your sister how to do some things for herself, I was doing my own laundry and making my own lunches at her age. Then you only have to help by making sure she has done the thing rather than do the thing. She will make silly lunches and accidentally turn her clothes pink at least once but that's fine and she will feel more independent.", "NTA, but you need to be more tactful about it.", "Tell your father. He should assume custody of your sister. In the meantime, continue being a stable influence in your little sister\u2019s life.", "Your mom is very depressed and the entire family is struggling from the repercussions of this divorce. I don't really have a solution, OP, it's just kind of a sucky situation you're all dealing with atm.\n\nNAH But I do hope she gets a job soon even if she hasn't gotten over the depression yet.", "NTA\n\nYour father is who you should be talking to about this.\n\nIf your mother isn't capable of caring for your sister due to her depression, then maybe should have reduced / no custody temporarily while she gets some help. And she definitely needs to get help.\n\nIf she refuses to get help, maybe you could go stay with your father?", "NTA \n\nIs it possible for your dad to take you in? Even with him working full time it seems like he\u2019d be more likely to take on the parental responsibilities and let you just be the child. You may still have to help here or there (and this is only if your sister goes with you, not if just you go to stay with him which I recommend) you wouldn\u2019t have to do even a 1/4 of what you are now. If your dads not in a position to take you, I\u2019d ask some friends to see if they\u2019d be willing to let you stay with them/or their family for a token rent amount. \n\nThey also have websites where people will rent out rooms, most of the time it\u2019s utilities included for between 4-600 a month. That might be ideal for you, you don\u2019t need to get a lease or your own, it\u2019s cheap, and you finally get to leave this toxic situation. Because it is toxic, what your mom is doing is neglecting/emotionally abusing the both of you, and you get the added bonus of being parentified and all the trauma that comes with that. Your mom needs a wake up call. She doesn\u2019t want to get help, and you enabling her is only stopping her from being forced to get it. \n\nOnly when you stop helping her and she\u2019s forced to fill her role again will she have to comes to terms with the fact that she doesn\u2019t have a choice and needs to see a doctor and/or psychiatrist. I\u2019m also saying this from experience my mom was the same way, hell even her mom was the same way with her. My mom only finally changed after she realized it costed her her relationship with me entirely and that I was over wanting any relationship with her at all. Not only that but not having my help forced her to find other arrangements and make changes. Your mom has to go through the same thing. \n\nKid it\u2019s not your responsibility to worry about your mothers feelings, or how she may react. It\u2019s not on you to make her life or your sisters life easier, you\u2019re not being an older brother; you\u2019re being a full time father and adult caregiver. She should be the one caring for you, not the other way around. I know it\u2019s hard to shut off your empathy for her, but atleast for not you have to. Until she recognizes she both needs and wants help you have to wash your hands clean. Whatever happens to her is her responsibility, he\u2019ll whatever happens to your sister is her responsibility too. It\u2019s not on you, the fact that you feel like it is breaks my heart. Get out OP, whatever it costs GET OUT. At minimum refuse to enable her further (aka \u201chelp\u201d her) don\u2019t do anything for your sister, and stop paying rent. Your mothers jobless, she has the means and opportunity. It\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t if she wanted to. Just release your own guilt, and live.", "Stupid"]}
