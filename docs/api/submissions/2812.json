Whether she lied or not is not the issue. She doesn't owe anyone her free time and her boss should absolutely not have got involved.", "YTA for the way you started talking about her \"attitude\". It's obvious she didn't want to babysit and came up with an excuse, and her boss busted her excuse and basically strong-armed her into babysitting. It's not your fault that her boss is AH who can't mind his own business, but you did nothing but exacerbate an already bad day for her with YOUR attitude about \"pity\" and \"charity case\". You could have just quietly reiterated to her that she doesn't need to feel obligated to come over if she doesn't feel like it, instead you decided to make a scene.", "NTA. The boss is the AH. You told her not to come and she still showed up. That\u2019s not your fault. I don\u2019t understand the people saying it\u2019s about your ego either since you clearly found someone else to watch the kids", "YTA. \n\nIf the kids don't like their grandmother, why did you call her ? You obviously could find someone else.", "I can\u2019t get over at how rude and unprofessional your mother\u2019 boss was!   If your mother is telling a white lie to get out of doing you a favour it is absolutely none of his business, and grabbing someone\u2019s cell phone out of their hand to take over a private conversation is bullying behaviour. \n\n**YTA** for putting your ego over your children.", "Lol im not surprised your kids don't like her, she sounds awful.", "YTA. I wonder why MiL tried to get out of it? Maybe she can sense the hostility radiating off of you. \n\nYou state at the beginning of the post that the reason you asked your MIL in the first place was that you didn\u2019t want your oldest to miss the party. By the end, your ego proved more important than your child, I guess, because you were willing to have your kid miss the party rather than suck it up and be grateful that your MIL would watch the kids.\n\nEdit: I missed the part where she found someone else to babysit. It doesn\u2019t change my judgment. If she knew MIL was coming over, grudgingly or not, she should have just let MIL babysit and then never asked her to babysit again.", "YTA for your entitlement, for getting annoyed and for trying to justify your behaviour by using the fact her job is flexible and she doesn\u2019t lose pay. Her boss is an AH too. She was trying to be polite and not hurt your feelings by letting you down gently then when her boss outed her you claim she had an attitude because she doesn\u2019t want to watch the kids? People aren\u2019t obligated to drop everything to watch your kids, even the grandparents are allowed to say no.", "YTA.  Her boss is the biggest AH here, but it's perfectly normal and fine for her to say no and offer a white lie.  It's not like you had a real emergency or anything.  It's also normal and fine for your feelings to be hurt about that, but snapping at her and insulting her and being extremely hostile (\"Get out of my driveway\", WTF?!?!) and telling her your kids don't even like her is way over the top.  You're a bigger AH than she was.", "YTA. I honestly have a hard time believing this. Just to make sure I'm following:\n\n-You asked your MIL for a favor\n-She does it, grudgingly or not, though it seems like she was doing her best to be polite and still help even after the (probably made up) part about her boss \"ripp[ing] the phone out of her hand\"\n-you throw a tantrum.\n\nYeah. I think you're the one who needs to check your attitude, not her.", "NTA, and the biggest AH here would be MIL's boss. She's second, because you told her not to come and she showed up anyway. You & your husband did the best you could under the circumstances.\n\nDon't ask her to babysit again, though. You obviously had other emergency backup child care--go with that.", "Disagreeing with majority of comments and saying NTA for the question at hand.\n\nYou TOLD her not to come and she still insisted on doing so, that's on her, not you.", "YTA\nYour MIL clearly didn\u2019t want to babysit, but instead of telling you that she made up a perfectly reasonable excuse.\n\nUnfortunately her boss felt the need to insinuate himself in the middle and accept on MILs behalf, giving her no room to say \u2018no\u2019 again.\n\nSo MIL did the RIGHT thing and showed up.\n\nAnd you? You literally throw her kindness in her face, you tell her the kids don\u2019t even like her and accuse her of \u2018having bad energy\u2019. You make a comment about HER attitude when it\u2019s you with the bad energy, bad attitude and entitled behavior.\n\nYou ARE ungrateful, and she\u2019s right, you should not have called her because clearly you don\u2019t like her and only asked her to babysit to use her. \n\nDid I mention that YTA?", "Nta I don't want someone watching my kids that doesn't want to be there. You asked her not to come and she came anyway, that's on her.", "NTA. \n\nMIL is being an AH because she LIED to get out of babysitting instead of just being honest and saying she didn\u2019t want to. You didn\u2019t even pressure her. MIL should blame her boss for wasting her afternoon as he used his workplace authority to basically send her over there.\n\nMIL\u2019s boss is an AH for getting in the middle of everything and stirring the pot. I think he was just trying to help you and show he was A Cool Boss but it backfired terribly. He could\u2019ve privately told MIL that she\u2019s welcome to go spend time with her grandkids.", "YTA and so is her boss. There was no reason to act like that. Telling her you got someone else firmly is fine, yelling insults is a bit much.", "YTA! Holy shit! I would never talk to my mother in law like that. Wow. Her son really picked a winner.", "YTA. Jesus Christ I hope your kids don\u2019t end up being horrible like you.", "YTA. I think you are going to better understand the saying your bad planning isn\u2019t my emergency when your kids are forgetting to tell you about school events and birthday parties. Just saying it does sound like you over-reacted.", "NTA children can tell when people don't really like them, you told her no, she didn't listen.", "Yta, when you move to pity and charity case, you make it clear that you are disgusted when people won't pick up the slack for YOUR PARENTING", "ESH.

Most people would have had a sense of humor about what an AH mil\u2019s boss was being calling her out like that.
