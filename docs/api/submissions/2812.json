Why did you even ask her is the kids don\u2019t like her- like I don\u2019t get it!?! \n\nEven worse who the hell was the back up if plan A was your mum who \u201cisn\u2019t fun, engaging\u2026. Uptight \u2026. Overly fake\u201d?\n\nYTA for your reaction if it\u2019s not clear.", "She didn't \"go on\", she told her not to come. She was maybe a tad impolite, but that's in response to MIL being immature and impolite.", "Why would you want to leave them with her if you know they don't like her?", "Yeah sorry but eating veggies isn't even a little bit comparable to this. Literally all OP did was telling someone that did not want to babysit that they would not have to.", "Because she isn\u2019t cruel or abusive. They just done like her but them playing while she sits on her phone isn\u2019t going to hurt them"]}
