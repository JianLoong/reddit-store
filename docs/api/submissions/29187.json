I work full time while Lisa is a sahm with an etsy shop where she makes and sells jewelry as our supplemental income.  \n\nA while back I received a nice bonus and after a bit of discussion, it was decided I'd use my bonus for myself. I managed to stay within budget but I booked myself a 2 week vacation to Hawaii. Of course this meant Lisa had the kids at home full time while I was gone.\n\nWhen I returned, Lisa was exhausted and I initially agreed to take the kids for the afternoon on Saturday so she could have some time to herself and unwind.\n\nMy cousin ended up inviting us to a BBQ the same day and my cousin is one of my best friends and I knew other childhood friends would be there. Lisa wasn't sure about going but I told her everyone would be happy to see her and the kids, plus I'd watch them so she can relax and have a drink or 2.\n\nThe day of the BBQ, the kids were out of control, crying, screaming, fighting, not listening or following direction. It was impossible to have a conversation or catch up with my cousin or friends.\n\nI repeatedly walked over to Lisa to ask her to give me a hand with the kids, each time she declined and said I agreed to watch them and this is her downtime.\n\nAfter another hour of chaos, I ended up yelling across the yard, for once, can you please get off your fucking ass and help me with our kids? Just once is all I'm asking for!\n\nLisa stomped over to me and started whisper yelling that I was breaking my promise to let her have time to relax, she didn't want to be here and feels I basically made her go. I tried explaining that these are people I don't see very often and to please not make a scene. Unfortunately a few people overheard us and we caught a few comments about Lisa being a lazy mom who only wanted to pawn the kids off on me/she's taking advantage of me.\n\nLisa burst into tears and yelled at the people standing nearby that made the comments for them to all go to hell, told me to basically fuck myself, took the car and left. She returned a few hours later to pick up me and the kids. We didn't speak to each other on the drive home.\n\nLater that night, I tried talking to her that the kids were having a rough day and I just needed her help for a bit so I could finish a few conversations and I would have taken them right back. Lisa objected that wasn't fair as she had the kids alone for 2 weeks while I was in Hawaii. She also said that's not what upset her the most, it was how I phrased what I said and how I let people insult her and didn't immediately jump to her defense. I told Lisa that those people don't know her like I do and have no idea how hard she works to take care of the kids, our house, and run her etsy shop, nor did I have time to react before she ended up leaving.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697659265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17azuyf/aita_asked_my_wife_to_help_with_the_kids/", "score": 726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You went alone for 2 weeks to Hawaii. You came back and all you gave your wife for this was 1 afternoon alone without having to deal with the children. You then guilt tripped her into going to an event when it was supposed to be her free time. She goes and then you are constantly asking her to help with the kids. WTF?! You shouldn't have guilted her into going, you should have paid for her a spa day at the very least, and you should not have asked her to do anything with the kids. And not only that but you were an ABSOLUTE ASSHOLE in the way you handled the situation when she declined help (that she wasn't supposed to be giving because after 2 weeks in paradise solo you were supposed to give her 1 measly afternoon). \n\n>how I let people insult her and didn't immediately jump to her defense.

Leaving your wife to take of three kids under five by herself.  Based on this alone you are a huge asshole.   You didn\u2019t say she agreed.  You said it was decided which leads me to believe that you told her that you were going on vacation without her and the kids and she could just suck it up and deal with it.  \n\nThen when you come back all refreshed from your two weeks of me time you insist on going to a BBQ that your wife didn\u2019t want to go too after you promised her one lousy afternoon to herself! Listen to yourself.  You had two weeks of me time and couldn\u2019t even give your wife one afternoon!  You promised to watch the kids at the BBQ and couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t even do that.  Then when she didn\u2019t stop her conversation to take care of the kids so you could finished your conversation you became abusive!   You yelled at her, you cursed at her, called her lazy in front of family! Then stayed silent while your family talked shit about her.  You made her the villain. You humiliated her and I think you liked it. \n\nWhat you did was disgusting!  I don\u2019t know your wife but I know she deserves better than you.

First you left your wife alone for two weeks so you could take a solo vacation to Hawaii.  Even if you were allowed to use your bonus on yourself, that was the most selfish choice you possibly could have made.  Then upon your return, you promise to give her a whole afternoon to herself, how generous!  Except that then you reneged on the offer so you could go to a BBQ.  And then when your wife (who by the way let you bang off to Hawaii by yourself for two weeks, remember that?) doesn't rescue you after having to take care of your own kids for a whole hour, you have a public tantrum and humiliate her?\n\nBro.  You should be embarrassed.", "1. The chaos at the BBQ was the same chaos your wife had to deal with for two weeks while you were in Hawaii. And all she got in return was an afternoon that she didn't even pick\n2. You made the mistake thinking you could socialize and 'payback' your wife by 'taking the kids'. You figured the event would occupy the kids and free you up to socialize. You were wrong and you took out your failed plan frustration on Lisa\n3. Defend your partner. Even after she left, did you make any attempt correct the negative comments about Lisa? Doubtful. She is willing to give up so much for you and take, clearly, very little from you.

How are you even asking if your the AH... it's pretty obvious.", "This must be fake.", "YTA. Your wife was clearly exhausted after that two weeks and she comes first, not your conversations with random relatives. Question - could she go away for two weeks and you look after the kids, or would you not cope? I think you need to talk to your wife, maybe she's feeling more exhausted / under more pressure than you realise. I have to say I'd be pretty annoyed in her place if my husband had just had a lovely two weeks tropical holiday, then on my first day I could get some respite insisted that I come to a busy social event but that he would take care of the kids so I could still relax, and then went back on his word because the kids were being annoying. 3 kids under 5 are always going to be annoying.", "I refuse to believe this is real.", "YTA - You broke your promise and you made a scene where your wife was made out to be the bad guy.", "Time for you to accept that the world does not revolve around you.

How the hell does your wife stay with you?? \n\nYou're a giant asshole.", "Yea, YTA. You left your wife home alone with the kids for two weeks and then when you came back, you forced her to go to the bbq that she didn't want to attend but you promised you would look after the kids while she gets a break at said bbq but you broke the promise because the second the kids started demanding your attention or started acting up, you immediately called for her to come help. Dude, I bet you dont even do anything for your wife and with your kids you just ignore them, telling them to go play while you leave it up to your wife to care for them. Idgaf if you bring home the money that puts clothes on their backs, food on the table, and a roof over their heads. You can't just ask your wife to watch the kids for two weeks and not expect her to be at her breaking point. I'm sure your wife loves your kids but do you realize how hard it is to be a stay at home mom and get some alone time?????\n\nDon't sit there and think your wife is happy being a stay at home mom because that's not true. Sure there are a lot of moments that make it worth while but if your wife doesn't get to go out and socialize herself or doesn't get a break she will go stir crazy and it can affect her mental health and her emotional health.  I mean look up the case about Andrea Pia Yates, a stay at home mother who was left by herself at home to care for her 5 kids while suffering from some bad mental health and possibly burn out on raising kids. \n\nNot saying that's how things will go but it's a good example of what mental and emotional burn out from raising kids without any self-care/\"me\" time can do to a full time parent.\n\nI mean it must be nice to have gotten away from all the whiny needy kids and your nagging wife, right? THen when you came home, it all came back again and you want to have a nice family without being responsible for raising your kids right? SOrry you can't have your cake and eat it too. It clearly shows that you dont appreciate your wife enough esp since you didn't even defend her when your extended family/relatives and friends all called your wife a lazy mom trying to pawn the kids off on you. You know money doesn't buy all the happiness in the world, IT can buy some stuff that can make you happy but money alone doesn't raise a kid. It's love, care, and parents teaching their kids how to be functional human beings.\n\nIf you dont wanna watch your kids but still want to give your wife a break, why not hire a nanny or have someone else watch your kids while treating your wife to her own vacation. Like would it kill you to man up and watch your kids and actually be a dad and husband instead of worrying about your wife embarrassing you in front of others at a social event that you forced her and the kids to go to? Esp when you lured her in with the promise that you'll watch the kids but you broke that promise and basically gaslit her and allowed your so called friends to say some horrible crap about your wife? The woman you claim to love? You know what? YTA. Divorce your wife if you dont wanna look after your kids.

You left your wife alone with 3 children in the baby/toddler age range ***for two weeks***.\n\nTo even it out, you said you would give her a free afternoon to herself. Already a shitty, one-sided deal. You get 336 hours to yourself, and she gets....maybe 8?\n\nYou then go back on your word, for selfish reasons. You wanting to see your friends is a selfish reason. Not only does your wife not get her free afternoon (which was a bullshit compromise anyways), but you utterly renege on your deal after she repeatedly reminded you about it.\n\nAnd when she gets unfairly called a lazy mom by a bunch of bystanders who know nothing of the issue, you don't stand up for her. You let them call her a lazy mom, you let all of the blame fall to her after she was on 24/7 duty ***for two weeks***. She was on call or actively on duty for 336 hours straight.\n\nDo you know how much money someone would be paid to be on duty for 336 hours straight? That is 256 hours of overtime. Let's do the math:\n\nAverage nanny salary for 3 kids under the age of 5 would be a ***minimum*** of $20/hour. Probably ***WAY*** higher, but let's go with $20/hour. She worked 80 hours at a normal rate of $20/hour. She worked 256 hours of overtime, since we were generous about the salary let's say this is paid at 2x. That is $11,840 worth of labor. On top of missing out on a 2 week vacation. And the repayment for her immense generosity of spirit is a ***fucking afternoon***.\n\nYTA. YTA.

He went to Vegas for his friend\u2019s birthday and I stayed home with the kids (I think he was gone for a week\u2026it was a few years ago). I went to Tokyo with my mom and we were gone for 2 weeks and he stayed home with the kids. We do normally take them together though. We\u2019re taking the kids (who are both teenagers now) to Disney and Universal in 2.5 weeks (and I can\u2019t wait).", "I get the wanting to go do something yourself if you have a specific hobby that your OH doesn\u2019t care for, scuba, hand gliding, underwater knife fighting etc. but 2 WEEKS!!!! FML, and then not to even give her an afternoon to herself\u2026.", "Especially in such a beautiful location that's known for being a romantic destination. But he went 'alone'", "But it was HIS bonus. /s", "I have never in my life heard of such a bizarre thing. I had friends when I was a kid whose parents would go on vacation without them and I thought that was really weird... It's basically telling the kids openly that they are a burden the parents deal with, not members of the family unit. This asshole could have at least taken his wife with him and had the grandparents watch the kids for two weeks.\n\nI dont even understand how a vacation could be enjoyable if you're just by yourself. Wouldn't you be sad that you couldn't share anything with your partner by your side? Wouldn't you just be thinking of your kids the whole time? Your whole life is your family at that point. Two weeks? I can see a weekend or a few days by yourself to laze out. But two weeks?? What a massive slap in the face to the wife and kids.\n\nThis guy is amazingly, breathtakingly self centered and manipulative to boot. Gross. \ud83e\udd22", "They\u2019re still pissed, and now I\u2019m joining. It\u2019s a pissed party.", "I\u2019m kinda wondering if he railroaded her into it tbh\u2026", "If OPs post is any indication of his effort or usefulness, the wife probably didn\u2019t notice he was gone", "Was there even a conversation? Or he just bought the ticket and told her afterwards?", "Well I bet he is such an asshole that she was happy to have him gone for two weeks......", "Seriously like wtf. Two weeks alone in Hawaii?!", "This jumped out at me too. Pretty sure \"after discussion, we agreed I would spend my bonus on myself\" was just him telling his wife it's his money since he worked for it and she should be grateful she gets to stay at home with the kids because he works so hard. No way in hell that woman was excited for him to peace out to Hawaii for two weeks without her and the kids.", "He probably screamed at her until she submitted to his demands, or threatened to leave and not pay child support.", "\ud83e\udd23 Yes, the Me, Myself and I committee.", "None of us did. We all know differently based on his attitude.", "Multiple times!", "Bold of you to assume he'd use all his visitation when he can't even wrangle the little monsters for an afternoon after a two week vacation", "Why? He will have off-loaded the kids onto his mom or new gf or something to begin with.", "My husband would go away for work every once in a while when the kids were young. It was tough doing everything myself with him gone, with 3 kids and a full-time job. Hubby would do everything he could do to ease my burden before he left and when he got back.", "It's hard when you can't see your friends because you have to spend 2 weeks on vacation by yourself in Hawaii.", "Both works as well. He's both.", "How about both?", "My husband is military and hates leaving me alone with the kids. When he could go to Australia he brought the kids and I.", "My mom bought my dad a fishing trip for his birthday but he changed it and we went to Greece instead.", "That seemed odd to me too. My husband and I have each taken short vacations with friends while the other stayed home w the kids, but we\u2019re talking about a long weekend at most. If we take longer trips, we go as a family.  I wouldn\u2019t want to be away from my kids for two weeks. I wonder if she was okay w him leaving for two weeks bc then she didn\u2019t have to deal w him.", "Exactly. I\u2019m not surprised they were acting up.", "It\u2019s weird that OP went in a 2 week vacation to Hawaii without his wife. Oh and she is with the kids alone.  \nOP comes off as selfish .", "He doesn't deserve anyone! I'm still wondering why anyone would want to go on a 2 week vacation alone??", "This was my first thought", "A weekend trip I totally get, my parents did that growing up too. that\u2019s cool of you guys though, to go for longer! Awesome that you\u2019ve found something that works for you! I just had never heard of it before tbh - maybe my family growing up just lacked the budget and it\u2019s more common than I thought", "That's super cool! But it's also reciprocated in your case which is most of the problem I have with this scenario. He left her alone with the kids for two weeks and she got no time off in return. If he offered her anything for going to this party on her one afternoon she was supposed to have off I might have had some sympathy for him. Marriage is a partnership and he's not pulling his weight.", "Oh those make sense. Interesting!  \n\nAnd ahhh fun!! If you\u2019re visiting CA feel free to DM me, I live in the area and have mastered the single day Disneyland trip (also can rec stuff to do when you\u2019re not in the parks)", "\ud83d\udcaf there is no way she happily agreed to that", "Like he railroaded her into going to the BBQ she didn't want to go to because he thought she'd cave and look after the kids so he could drink and talk to people? (Because he 100% talked her into going to the BBQ because he didn't want to have to watch the kids.) Likely.", "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s HIS bonus so why should HE have to ask her permission to spend it?      \n        \nEdit \u2014 omg, I should have added an /s or something. I meant this to be from his perspective and clearly ridiculous!!!!", "Based off [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ppj6Sb5vGv) I\u2019m going with the latter.", "my ass would\u2019ve spent that two weeks moving out and then stuck him with massive alimony and child support. 2 weeks in hawaii ain\u2019t cheap so that was a big bonus, bet she could live good on that in peace with her babies", "Very valid point \u2026 probably be. A Disneyland Dad and swoop in every couple of years for the grand gesture.", "Obviously he\u2019d just get a girlfriend in her early 20\u2019s who wants to play house on the weekends", "honestly they might be better off. He can be an automatic deposit into her account and nothing more", "Exactly!", "Like a normal spouse. This guy.", "I mean I doubt he was alone his mistress was most likely there.", "This has to be fake. No parent in their right mind would leave the other with three kids under 5 for TWO WEEKS for a leisure trip. Unless they were monstrously, dementedly selfish. The aftermath of the trip is bad enough here, but I almost stopped reading at \u201cI left my wife with (basically) three toddlers to go on a non-essential trip for TWO WEEKS.\u201d\n\nMost men would be dead for even asking. The balls on this guy. \ud83d\udc80", "The part where he says \"it was decided\" about spending his bonus 100% on himself was the first sign. OP's wording comes across like he invited his partner to discuss what to do, then didn't give any of her suggestions any weight or consideration until she finally relented and \"agreed\" to his choice.", "very very weird. VERY.", "I couldn't understand this part at all. If you're going on a 2 week Hawaiian vacation why wouldn't you want your spouse? If they could afford him to stay for 2 weeks they could have afforded to stay a few days less but bring OP. Unless it was a baby sitting issues, but it seems like the husband has plenty of friends \ud83d\ude44", "No kidding. How does THAT work?\n\n\"A while back I received a nice bonus and after a bit of discussion, it was decided I'd use my bonus for myself. \"\n\nIt was decided. I think I'd like to see the transcript of that conversation.", "What husband goes on a two week vacation without his wife?!?   So so weird.", "Can we still use \ud83d\udea9...This one needs a bunch", "We often do separate trips. Lots of reasons, but biggest is just childcare. going somewhere together means either coordinating sleepaway camps or calling in favors. Just one night away was a big logistical lift. Leaving the kids with the other parent is just\u2026 easy.", "Is he paying her a fair salary for being a full time cook, maid, and nanny to his 3 kids? No? Ok, then as she's not an employee and she gets no payment for any of her contribution to the household, she is his spouse and she's entitled to a fair share of the FAMILY income. Hope that clears things up.", "That might even be a stretch", "Bet he'd pick them up around noon, expecting her to have already fed them, and bring them back in time for dinner. Then complain about how hard it is to handle all 3 of them at the same time.", "Possible. Or she'd be the opposite and want him to pretend he didn't have them and start over with her", "Not impossible. Something similar happened with my sister - once a trip to Ireland and once a trip to wine country California.", "Right?!? I had a BIL who went on vacation alone once. I told my sis that it just sounded very strange to me. He came home one day, moved his things out the next day while my sis was at work. The vacation has been a test to see if he and his mistress were compatible. \n\nBonus: Mistress recently left him for another guy. I've never been so glad to bump into an ex-BIL as I was to see him at the grocery store one night lol", "Exactly what I thought.", "Yuuuup", "I thought the same thing!", "I concur. Why else would he go ALONE to Hawaii? I'm not saying Noone ever goes on vacation alone. But it seems highly unlikely to not take the wife and kids unless you are meeting someone there.", "It definitely sounded like a made-up scenario. What wife would agree to that? What husband and father of three goes on solo vacation to Hawaii? FOR TWO WEEKS?!", "Interesting!! When I was a kid my parents definitely did individual weekends away, so I get that. I just don\u2019t think they ever took a planned \u201cvacation\u201d like 6+ days (non work related) alone. They\u2019d go together and drop us off with family friends (grandparents were ~8 hours by car) for a week. Then those friends took a week away and we watched their kids.", "apparently I should have added an /s or something because my comment was supposed to be an impression of what he\u2019d say that is clearly ridiculous and selfish and wrong!!!! I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what *OP* thinks in his mind (because he does not value the work his wife does as a SAHM mom one bit). I am in complete agreement with you! Hate to have even caused the misimpression he\u2019d have a single defender in these comments.", "Not impossible, I just find it very unlikely a husband would 3 kids under 5 would choose to do that if no one else is involved. Now if his wife wanted to go and leave her 4 kids I\u2019d understand.", "I hope she had fun", "Exactly! How do you take your whole bonus and not take everyone on a trip or maybe go on a small couples weekend and then payoff some bills or save for the kids?!? This dude reeks of midlife crisis and trying to relive his college days lol.", "One that is used to being bulldozed over decisions like this...and probably treated like crap. I mean he obviously KNEW what he was doing when he yelled for her to \"get off her fucking ass for once and help with the kids\". He knew how that would look to everyone.", "My parents did something similar.  We just haven\u2019t really had that family or friends option in a long time.  I wish we did but c\u2019est la vie."]}
