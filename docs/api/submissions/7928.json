People should be cognizant of their parking jobs, especially larger cars in compact spots. They effed around and found out with their disregard to other people and space.", "NTA. She was the AH for not parking within the lines of her space.  Bit you are lucky she didn't key your car. People here  can be really petty sometimes.", "NTA. If that makes you an AH, then we both are. If parking is limited and I can fit into the space even if the other cars are parked improperly, I will do it.  Of course, we run the risk of that someone will damage our car, so take photos of the cars before walking away!", "NTA.

You knew you made their vehicle inaccessible and did so with joy. There are plenty of stupidly parked cars in every parking lot but what you did was petty. Don't be like that.

Gotta call em out.", ">INFO can you clarify if spot 4 was several inches over because of maybe spot 5, or if they really just did a terrible job parking?\n\nValid question; The honest answer is I don't know.\n\nHowever, when exiting the left side of your vehicle, it\u2019s fairly easy to see exacly where one is parked in relation to the line.\n\nFurthermore, I parked within the lines \u2014 Why is it my fault if someone chose to perpetuate parking outside the lines?", "They weren't being the parking police.

They knew for certain the other person would not be able to enter their driver's side door.\n\nI try to think of things as if it were my 82yro father.  He pulls in and parks and finds he needs to be over the line because the person next to him is parked incorrectly.  He comes out to find someone has blocked his entry into the car.  While in stellar health, there's no way he's going to be able to open the passenger side door and climb across to fold his legs into the driver's seat at his age.  What are his options?\n\nIt was vindictive and done without all the information.  OP was the AH.", "It dictates whether or not the driver's doors are impacted by the cars next to them. If I'm pulling into a tight space, whether I pull in forward or backwards is determined by how the cars are facing, in case I can maximize space on one side that will have both of our drivers side doors.", "I purposely do that too lol"]}
