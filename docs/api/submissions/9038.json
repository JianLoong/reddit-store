The flute was made of stone called \u201ccombarbalita\u201d, which means it was meant to last through generations, so it had to be broken on purpose. She talked about a connection between the flute and its owner being buried together, and the idea that the instrument was willfully broken in order to bring the instrument closer to his owner in eternity, achieving immortality for both of them by that irreversible action of breaking an instrument that was meant to last forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m basically paraphrasing but that was the idea.

In the context of a funeral for our dear friend, however, I thought it was out of pocket and sort of distasteful, disrespectful, to talk about that.\n\nGeorge\u2019s mother was polite and she asked some questions but she was mostly quiet just listening to Phoebe talking non-stop. Then, George\u2019s father and brother approached us and she was about to start to tell them the whole damn story once again.

We talked about it later, back in our place and I explained why I reacted that way. She said \u201c gotcha, you\u2019re fine\u201d but she has acted differently to me since that day. One of my friends told me that I \u2018broke\u2019 her and it does feel that way. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s a robot and her software it\u2019s malfunctioning.

I even realize that you quietly tried to get her to stop, and she proceeded anyway. But the language you used to actually get her to stop was harsh.\n\nI also understand that some people ramble when they\u2019re nervous/uncomfortable, and this might have been her doing just that. However, it was not the time nor the place. And especially the fact it was the deceased friend\u2019s mother. That poor woman probably had enough going on in her head at the moment already.", "YTA and that you think it's okay to talk to her in that manner shows the relationship isn't nearly as good as you claim. I'd fully guess it was nerves. Just like some people laugh at funerals even when upset she seems to have word vomit. You could have easily guided her another direction away from his parents. Was her behavior rather off? Yes. But she wasn't purposefully being an asshole unlike you.", "YTA\n\n(A) she was probably pretty uncomfortable because funerals suck, (B) she was talking about something relating to immortality, which ties in to death, so it's not like the topic just came out of left field, (C) there were 101 ways to tell your girlfriend that it was not an appropriate time - and you still managed to pick the worst one.\n\n>She said \u201c gotcha, you\u2019re fine\u201d but she has acted differently to me since that day\n\nThis gives the same vibes as an AITA that I read awhile back.

There was zero reason for you to swear at her and tell her to shut up. You could have just quietly said \"maybe not now,\" or \"hey just don't talk about that right now please.\" Like the way you delivered that message was not okay and I wouldn't have been okay with my partner speaking like that to me in any context. She's mourning the loss of a friend and then her partner is swearing at her and telling her to shut up... that would make anyone feel like garbage. You have some apologizing to do", "YTA. Saying \"shut the fuck up\" to your fianc\u00e9e, at a funeral where you are both grieving a loss, was unnecessary. There are plenty of ways to disengage someone from a discussion, including simply leading them away with some excuse. \n\nI agree her topic was bizarre, but maybe George's mother mentioned something tangentially related and your fianc\u00e9e in her nervousness just started rolling. George's mother knew how to handle the situation far better than you, maybe you should have taken some social tips from her.", "YTA\n\nThis is so me, I get in an uncomfortable situation and just start rambling, and yes, usually about the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n\nLuckily I have my husband and he will usually leed me away by my arm (with an excuse to get coffee, food etc.) and he then tells me what I am doing.\n\nNever has he ever swore at me or talk to me in that way in front of other people.\n\nIf you want to save your relationship, you better apologize for your behavior and talk about a better way to handle it next time.", "NAH. I really don\u2019t get all these Y T A votes. Funerals just suck. \n\nI understand why she reacted the way she did; she was probably rambling because she felt awkward and uncomfortable. For your part, sure you could have phrased it a little nicer than just \u201cstfu\u201d but again, *you* also felt awkward and uncomfortable because that\u2019s just how funerals are. \n\nTalk to your gf, maybe apologize for your harsh phrasing, but don\u2019t be too hard on yourself or on her. Forgive yourselves, forgive each other, and move on.", "INFO: \n\nIs Phoebe neurodivergent and/or does she have any kind of history of speaking off-topic in this manner? Or was this entirely unexpected behavior for her?", "NTA if she was nervous and rambling but just because someone is nervous that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to be inappropriate at a funeral.", "So your fianc\u00e9e is rambling during a very uncomfortable time, instead of helping her get out of the situation, taking her arm and asking if she wants to get some coffee perhaps. You swear at her? Do you really need to ask if YTA?", "YTA Telling your partner to shut the eff up in any context, ever, is an AH move. Saying it in public? Double AH.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Phobe talking to the dead guy\u2019s mom about ancient burial practices was tone-deaf, but telling her to shut the eff up? Nope. No excuse.", "This is both ESH and NAH. Funerals are awkward, death is so complicated to navigate, especially when it's someone so young. You both handled it poorly, just in diametrically opposite ways.  Talk to her again, explain that you realize you shouldn't have said what you said the way you said it, but that you were also under a tremendous amount of stress and listening to her talking even more about death at a funeral was making you very uncomfortable, and you think you both need to extend some grace and understanding to each other.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, YOU deemed the topic disrespectful, you don\u2019t actually know that George\u2019s family thought the same and in fact they may have enjoyed the conversation, maybe even found it comforting in a way. You don\u2019t know.\n\nSecond of all, there was absolutely no need to tell her to shut the fuck up, at all. You could have politely excused the two of you and quietly explained to her in private why you thought the conversation wasn\u2019t appropriate but instead you were rude to her and embarrassed her in front of anyone who heard you say that.\n\nThird of all, given your description of your fianc\u00e9e, she seems like she could be on the neurodivergent spectrum. If that is the case then you have done one of the most crushing things you can do to a neurodivergent person which is completely shut them down when they\u2019re talking about a special interest. I suggest looking into the topic more and seeing for yourself if that sounds like your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nBut, regardless of whether or not she is neurodivergent, telling someone to shut the fuck up when they\u2019re talking is hugely disrespectful and of course she is going to act differently when you\u2019ve treated her like that. I suggest you apologise, extensively.", "Everyone deals with stress and mourning and such differently. It seems like you were concerned for others feelings and don't want them more upset then they were. \n\nYour fiance is kinda like me. I would have done the exact same thing if I had knowledge of cultures and their funeral traditions. \n\nShe was trying to comfort the mom. IMO it's way better than everyone coming up to you saying \"I'm sorry for your loss if you need anything I'm here\" 100x that day. \n\nThe mom understood your fiance was trying to help in a way. Your fiance was probably very nervous too. \n\nWhen my cat died I screamed in a way that you just know was complete loss. 10 minutes later I seemed fine. \n\nYou should not have told her to shut the fuck up though as others have said. \n\nDo you talk to her like that often? If it was a one time thing... maybe stress idk people's brains don't work when they are stressed out. \n\nBut if it's a regular thing you need to have a talk with her and apologize. That wasn't the right way to respond to her trying to help.", "YTA.  Your fianc\u00e9 was definitely being awkward, but you never tell your SO to STFU.  I've done it twice with my wife who I've been with for 15 years and she didn't talk to me for the rest of the day no matter how much I apologized. Buy her some flowers and apologize again.  Good luck", "YTA solely for the way you spoke to her. I get your point about her making you uncomfortable with her off-topic lengthy conversations. However, I also see how that could have been her reaction to an already uncomfortable situation to begin with. Funerals are a tough time, and maybe she didn't know what to say to the family and/or was nervous, which resulted in her behavior. You may have thought way more of it than his family did. The issue here is how you addressed it and the very disrespectful way you spoke to her. That was way more inappropriate and disrespectful than anything she did.", "i'm sorry, NTA - yeah, funerals are awkward and stressful. that does not mean you take those feelings out on *the mother of the deceased* in whatever way pops into your head. should you have steered her away at some point before this? probably, but. you didn't and your fiance's a grown ass adult who shouldn't need to be babysat or informed that talking up a random Wikipedia rabbit hole at a funeral to the mom of the person in the coffin is not the appropriate time or place. she didn't notice all the signs that George's mother wasn't in the mood, she didn't hear you when you told her to stop quietly.\n\ni do agree that it sounds like your fiance may be on the spectrum for neurodivergence if this is a thing that happens often but guess what. even if she were autistic, that's not an excuse.", "This is a hard one, I\u2019m going with NAH just a horrible stressful situation. She was info dumping on a grieving mother and you felt, not unreasonably, you needed to stop her. Her feelings are hurt because you made clear her weird reaction was inappropriate. But her behaviour was probably a stress reaction that she couldn\u2019t help and now she\u2019s mortified. All I can say is treat her kindly and I hope you can both start to heal, I\u2019m really sorry for your loss.", "YTA for the way you spoke to her and I think you know it. She\u2019s now probably wondering if she wants to tie herself for life to someone who talks to her that way. If you had taken her aside and said \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a topic we should be talking about at the funeral\u201d you would\u2019ve absolutely not been TA. But you verbally lashed out at her instead when she\u2019s also grieving. You really need to apologize for the way you spoke to her and have a serious conversation about this.", "I'll go with ESH but I think you more so. \n\nAs long as how it went down was how you explained it then yeah she was out of line with going on a rant about something that people didn't care about at the funeral. It does seem like an odd topic so I'm a little inclined to believe that you left something out explaining why she brought it up. It seems more likely that someone brought up a topic similar and she jumped on board and overdid it. But it was also her friend too so she is grieving and it's coming out in an awkward way.   \n\n\nBut the way you talked to her was wayyyyy too harsh. Especially the comment at the end comparing her to a robot. Like wtf is that.", "YTA. Your fiance seems socially awkward and she may just not have known what else to talk about. Since you're paraphrasing you may not have got the point of what she was trying to say and I don't know enough about archaeology to know what she was talking about but it was obviously about a loved child being buried by someone who cared about him.\n\nWhen you told her to \u201cjust shut the f\\*ck up, please\u201d you told her that you don't think what she has to say is worth hearing and that is why she is upset.", "YTA\n\nI get where she was going with that, and honestly it would have comforted me a whole lot more than the standard platitudes at my mom's funeral. I suspect the idea behind it resonated strongly with her and how she views your mutual friends death, and was sharing something deeply personal and very related to the context with his parents. You swearing at her was crappy, but what it was about was probably way worse if she was sharing it because it was deeply meaningful to her.", "YTA she might have lacked social awareness but you could have handled it much better. Try and make things right?", "YTA", "And you\u2019re still engaged? Wow. YTA.", "YTA for cutting her down that way, you could've easily pulled her aside and told her she was going on.", "YTA. Other comments have explained why really well. Gotta love a person willing to tell their loved one to \"shut the fuck up\" during a grief filled time.", "NTA. The subject of mummies and the gory details should not be a topic of conversation to a mom whose son is dead in the coffin. Your Fiancee is clueless. I'm not buying the stressful situation. It's common sense not to broach that subject and then have articles and stuff at a funeral.  You asked her to please stop but she was ready to go on her ill timed rant. You could have left the curse words out but I'm sure it was just a knee jerk reaction.  I don't see how that would break her.  She needs therapy if it did.  It may be just sadness since your college friend is gone. Give it some time.", "YTA she was nervous and talking weird stuff because her friend died, you could have told her to stop nicely, instead of being EXTREMELY rude out of nowhere, called her to the side and talked to her like \"honey, I don't think they want to hear about this subject right now\" man, you were an big AH good lord, she must be feeling grief, embarrassment, anger and confused at the same time. Poor woman, if you love her, do your best to fix it and make her feel better, apologize as much as necessary and think about her feelings before being rude like this again.", "YMBTA.  It may of been nice for your friend\u2019s mother to have a moment where there\u2019s another subject besides her dead son as she encounters a constant line of people who are expressing pity, sorrow, condolences as they confront what she has for days. \n\n\u2026but next time, if there is one, just squeeze her hand as a signal.", "ESH and you specifically for the language you used. \n\nSounds like you didn't even try to tell her nicely that what she was doing was inappropriate. She was out of line with her topic, but you should've addressed it in a nicer way.", "EDIT YTA\n\nOld Informationen request Did George play an instrument? The flute or any other instrument? Because that's an obvi connection if he did.", "ESH.  Yes, she should have known to shut the fuck up.  However, you could have found a nicer way to deliver the message.", "INFO: Can you tell us more about your cool archaeologist fiancee?", "NTA, she was being wild as fuck and, once called out for it, is acting like a child. It\u2019s typical for people on Reddit to completely back women for ANYTHING they do wrong. This was some real crazy shit she was doing. It is fine to say shut the fuck up to someone who needs to shut the fuck up. If she is this emotionally crazy to shut down over this then she is not the type of person you want to be with.", "dude, people cope in different ways and if the family didn't say anything, I don't understand why you had to be so rude.\n\nYTA, you need to learn to communicate and not to be a massive asshole.", "NTA. Not the place, not the time, and emotions involved with a funeral excuse your harshness.", "ESH\n\nApproach was wrong but appreciated. I had someone ramble at my moms funeral about another death that happened 20 years ago about a person they didn\u2019t even know personally. I just told them to leave me alone and allow me to grieve for my mother. They got red in the face and left crying \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I don\u2019t regret it and I told them so later. It was my mothers funeral and you were talking about someone you didn\u2019t even know death and I didn\u2019t want to hear it. I had already told you, okay can we end the conversation and you continued so I snapped. Not my best moment but I was so relieved when they left. I\u2019m the oldest and I still had so much on my mind, plus people still needed to give well wishes. She was making my sister cry because of the story. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

Yikes) has just died, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect George\u2019s mother to take the time and effort to \u201cinterpret\u201d what this stranger (it sounds like the deceased parents didn\u2019t really know Pheobe or OP well) is telling her in a rather long winded story with many \u201cfancy\u201d words. \n\nThe way I interpret the situation the mother\u2019s husband and other son were coming over to \u201crescue\u201d their wife/mother from this situation they observed.  Which was Pheobe monopolizing George\u2019s mother at the FUNERAL with a long winded story.  Rather than read the room, Pheobe doubled down and started all over again.  \n\nI can definitely see myself using the same language as OP in this situation.   \n\nIn reading OP\u2019s edit, it sounds like he very much cares about Pheobe and their relationship.   Maybe it\u2019s time for another heart to heart talk about the situation.  Instead of being mad, Pheobe could be quiet now because she feels embarrassed about how she behaved at the funeral.  \n\nMy husband and I don\u2019t fight very often and swearing at each other is certainly not our norm.  However, after 36 years of marriage there has been a few times one of us has said something similar to the other such as what OP said to Pheobe.

Even if they were you don't have to be a dick.", "Yes you did. To her face. Around a bunch of other people. You just used different words.

Or because she\u2019s hurt. We\u2019ll see.", "YTA for using that language with your fianc\u00e9.  You do not speak to people you love that way.\n\nMy guess is that she was uncomfortable and thought this was a way to make conversation.  Misguided yes but it happens to the best of us.  And you would be okay with quietly pulling her aside and reminding her that people probably didn't want this type of conversation at a funeral.\n\nBut telling her to shut the f up?  That is not okay.", "Im not gonna give a judgement here because death is hard. I\u2019m gonna give you a story from a situation sort of similar to yours. \n\nAbout 6 years ago my aunt was vacationing and ended up going to urgent care. They called an ambulance and sent her straight to the hospital into ICU (even though she was 100% coherent and walking just fine. She literally walked herself like it was no big deal into ICU). About 3 hours later she died completely unexpectedly. The family (grandparents, parents, siblings, and cousins) all got together at my grandparents house just to be there for each other. It was so unexpected and everyone was trying to even process it. My gf at the time came over there with me and as the whole family were together it was just uncomfortable. My gf start trying to just talk about different things, even gently adding a joke or 2, just so it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable silence as we waited for a phone call. I felt uncomfortable with what she was doing thinking similarly to what you were thinking. \n\nLater when we had the funeral and the celebration of life afterwards, multiple members of my family came up to her and I to thank us (she deserves the thanks, not me) for just talking that night. I thought everyone would\u2019ve felt like I did, but I was proven wrong. \n\nDeath causes strange things to happen in someone\u2019s mind.  We all deal with death differently. But it\u2019s all about supporting each other through grieving. It\u2019s hard but you just have to do what you can. I\u2019ve dealt with most of my moms family deaths. Her entire immediate family (mom, dad, and siblings) have passed away. Every one of those deaths hit me completely differently. There is no right or wrong way to deal with death. Some people just want to talk, some completely shutdown, sometimes people appear like it didn\u2019t affect them at all. I\u2019ve had all of those reactions, but the similarity between everyone is feeling the pain of death on the inside. \n\nThere is no right way to deal with your grief. All you can do is be supportive and allow people to grieve how the need to. I think you handled that situation wrong, but grief does make people sometimes act sort of irrationally. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the loss of you and your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s friend. Internet hugs sent your way", "YTA\n\nAs someone who buried a child- people say crazy shit.\nTalking about death rituals at least has some sort of symbolism.\nIf the mother didn\u2019t want to hear, I\u2019m promising you- she would have walked away. Burying your child brings a whole other level of no fucks given \nPeople don\u2019t know how to handle death or react to it. The person who passed was young and it was a shock.\nYou have no idea what brings people comfort in those dark times. I get comfort knowing my son is never alone because bits of cremations mix together so my son will literally never be alone.", "*\"Don\u2019t call my fianc\u00e9 \u201ccrazy\u201d or derogatory words.

I don't understand how the topic was inappropriate for a funeral. She was discussing how some people honor the dead. I've been to a funeral for someone young and discussions about the afterlife such as Valhalla and other funeral practices were common topics among the mourners.

Burying loved ones with items in hopes that they can continue to use them is a common idea.", "Its the way you said it that makes you the asshole...", "You told her to shut the fuck up, and she did.

She was trying to comfort the family with what maybe she saw as a comforting story about how you can have a \"broken\" thing, but it actually can make you closer to what you lost. Or I could also see it as maybe representing that just because something is gone or broken doesn't mean you lose it forever. Her intentions seem to be good. It may have also been a coping mechanism for her. So telling her to shut up would be like saying \"just get over it\". Whichever way you slice it, you two need to have a sit down. You've told her why you said what you did, but you don't say you asked her why she said what she did. You both need to explain your points of view and realize that just because you have different views doesn't make one of them wrong.", "YTA. Saying \u201cjust shut the fuck up,\u201d no matter the context, is too far in a relationship. That will damage the foundation, and it\u2019s no surprise she isn\u2019t acting like herself anymore. You said something that is damaging and now she is damaged by it. Making the pikachu face doesn\u2019t absolve you of the responsibility of what was said. I would not want to speak to you after that, either. Why would she want to, you told her to shut the fuck up. So she did. Deal with it or apologize for being a jerk.", "Yta, some people ramble when they don't know what to say it could be she didn't know what to say to his family, so rambled about an article she recently read. You could have taken her to one side and explained it's not the vest topic for a funeral", "Nope, definitely NTA. I say this as someone who loves to info dump like this at every opportunity. While I'd like to think I'd have more sense than to monopolize the parent of a deceased friend at their own child's funeral by discussing an anthropological perspective burial customs from other cultures, I can imagine myself potentially doing this. And this is why family and friends know they have permission to gently step in when I'm going on and on about something, especially if it's on a topic they already know plenty about (and so I'm not providing any new information).\n\nIt sucks that you had to hiss STFU at her, but she wasn't taking in your more gentle cues and nudges.

Expecially if the ones she was speaking with found comfort in it. However, if that wasn't the manner/intent and she was indeed just lecturing whomever then it certainly is inappropriate in that context and was probably the last thing the listener wanted to hear. It's for that that your girlfriend was possibly an asshole in this scenario and if it was indeed the latter then all the YTA's need to reconsider the events. \n\nOn the other hand, the way you went about speaking to your girlfriend does make you an asshole. Grieving aside, you easily could have pulled her aside and explained that it was inappropriate and causing harm (if that was the case) instead of being verbally brutal towards her. \n\nMy only advise, no matter which scenario truly occured, is for you to sit her down and explain why you said what you said and acted in that manner. Apologize, genuinely, and then ask her what her intentions were and try to see it from her point of view. Was she trying to be helpful and bring peace? Was she just anxious? Was she indeed cluelessly causing harm?

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It doesn\u2019t mean that either of you is wrong. But neither of you should be trying to force the other to grieve in a particular way.

I understand why you did it, but you could have been blunt with a little more tact, such as \"I don't think what you're talking about is appropriate at all\". I understand that you can't always think of the right thing to say in the situation, so that's why I don't believe you're an a-hole here. \n\nI suspect she's \"broken\" in a combo of being angry about being publicly corrected and embarrassed about being in the wrong if she realized it. I think you need to apologize for the language you used and give an explanation of why you chose such strong language which is her social faux pas combined with your grief. Sorry about the loss of your friend, I wish you the best of luck.", "I'd give you a soft YTA. A slight hand squeeze and a little shake of the head was the way to go.", "A soft YTA\nMaybe she handles grief with the rambling, or maybe she felt she needed to fill the silence with anything and that's just what she had in her head at the time.\n\nI'm saying YTA because of the extreme jump of \"please dont\" to \"stfu\" . However, I recognize that grief isn't the greatest mediator. So, I understand why it came out.\n\nHave you spoken with her, now some time has gone by, and just asked her how she's doing? Talked about.your friend? And your own feelings?\nMaybe have a talk that can bring emotion back into it. In a healthy way.", "YTA. there were better ways to pull her out of the conversation. and sometimes there's nothing you can do. people ramble at funerals because they don't know what to say so usually some family or friends have to go defense and shoo people like your fiance away away from the main grievers. that's probably what would have happened without your outburst, and if not, the parents would have made their excuses", "YTA specifically for the toxic manner in which you went about it. People really, **REALLY** need to get it through their heads that just because a behavior is inappropriate for a situation does not automatically mean that the appropriate response is unbridled hostility, and that is exactly what saying \"just shut the fuck up\" is.", "YTA\n\nI understand both sides. She was very likely uncomfortable and awkward, unsure how to comfort this woman but feeling responsible for doing her best to try. It sounds like she was trying to make a connection about the flute\u2019s owner going into the afterlife with the thing that made him special, and the boy\u2019s talent making him \u201cimmortal\u201d in a sense, the same way songwriters will be long outlasted by their songs.\n\nSweet sentiment, but wrong place and bad execution. \n\nYou could\u2019ve said something about getting a text that needed her attention. Seeing somebody you both knew, and needing to pull her away, after quickly giving them both your condolences. Or even sent her a text and telling her you think you felt her phone buzz, and she might want to check it because you asked for some really important documents to be sent to her. \n\nInstead, you cursed her out. At a funeral, in front of the deceased\u2019s parents. That is *never* acceptable, but is in way worse form here than anything your fianc\u00e9e was doing. At least she had good intentions, and was trying to give them a sweet message to comfort them. You just humiliated them all.\n\nAlso, \n\n> Don\u2019t call my fianc\u00e9 \u201ccrazy\u201d or derogatory words.\n\n> I\u2019m deleting this if you keep attacking her\n\nYou won\u2019t accept it from strangers, but you expect her to accept it from you? Hypocritical.\n\nI\u2019ve lost siblings, a parent. I was a kid at their funerals, then a teenager. I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of odd behaviour, but you know what? I don\u2019t remember any of it. I do remember, however, that they all tried. All these people went out of their way trying to comfort me and my mum. \n\nWhat I would have remembered was a guy telling his girlfriend to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d right in front of my mother and I.", "YTA I actually don't think she was being super inappropriate. Awkward yes but I see the message she was conveying and it's well intentioned. She wasn't just talking about a mummy, she was talking about grief and finding a sort of immortality in the face of it. It would have been fine if you had said 'maybe not right now' but you were far too harsh.", "YTA. You seem intelligent and you don't see what she was doing? Man, high IQ, low EQ. Let me explain. She was sharing knowledge as a way of comfort because that's how she interpreted it. Honestly, she sounds possibly autistic because that's how most autistic people handle grief. With information and knowledge we find comforting about the topic. You told her to STFU while she was using her way to comfort someone. You should feel like an ahole. Go apologize to her.", "If you were trying to spare George\u2019s family from a \u201cdistasteful, disrespectful\u201d talk I\u2019m sure that they didn\u2019t feel remotely disrespected by watching you tell your partner to \u201cjust shut the fuck up please.\u201d\n\nShe seems to have made a well intentioned blunder, you made a deliberate decision to swear at her and betrayed her in front of the bereaved relatives you want to \u201csave\u201d from her \u201cdistasteful\u201d words. \n\nYTA because you turned an awkward conversation into a nasty confrontation.

At 27, she should understand social cues. \n\nNTA.", "Yes, if it hadn't been for your tacky fiance bringing up the idea of death, the grieving mother could have relaxed at the funeral and forgotten that her son is dead. Oh, wait, that's totally ridiculous because she will never in her life forget for a single GD minute that her child is dead, especially not at his funeral.  If there is any place it IS appropriate to bring up death and funeary ritual, it's at a funeral. \n\nYour fiance shared a touching bit of historical trivia that spoke to the  nigh Universal belief in an afterlife, the collective grief that is felt by all the mothers who have suffered this loss before, and the hole that is left in the universe by any individual who dies while beloved. It was far more thoughtful and personalized than your average 'sorry for your loss.' Your fiance is an empathetic person who was trying to comfort a grieving mother.

You were extremely rude to her. Never curse at your wife.", "YTA... You needed to find a better way to redirect her. \"Excuse us for a minute, we need a moment in private\"  This random conversation might have been her way of detaching in an uncomfortable situation and removing her and speaking to her privately was the way to fix this.

Don\u2019t swear at them.  It\u2019s rude and uncalled for.\n\nBut also, honestly, if being told to shut up (with no other additional crap between them) breaks a person\u2026 they were already unhinged or being extra over dramatic.  \n\nShe\u2019s childish for making it a huge thing.\n\nYou\u2019re childish for your shit communication skills.", "INFO: did George play an instrument and was he being buried with it?", "People deal with grief in many different ways, some do things that others dont understand or like, I cant think of any other reason for her archaeology conversation. Could you of been nicer in telling her to be quiet, absolutely! but you didnt. I reckon you should apologize to her or apologize for how you said it idk. And have a heart to heart about how you both are feeling. Communication is the key here. Her feelings matter just like yours do.", "You\u2019re so obviously the asshole. Who the hell speaks to their fianc\u00e9 like that? \n\nYou told her to shut the fuck up and that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing. YTA.", "YTA.

Nothing your fianc\u00e9 said was inappropriate for the occasion, you just felt uncomfortable with the subject matter. You said yourself George's mother was asking questions.

Hearing someone yell at their SO to shut the fuck up would be just as, if not more, uncomfortable than an unnecessary story", "But none of them were archaeologists! They did a business administration degree! She should only be talking about business administration! AITA for pointing this out?", "If it was that uncomfortable of a funeral for Phoebe, just wait until you find out how uncomfortable it was for George's mom! \n\nNTA, all the way.", "He's not TA for telling her to stop, he's TA for how he said it and it's made worse by his complete inability to understand why she is upset and comparing her to a \"malfunctioning robot\"", "So long as they included the story that was told - which is obviously not about burial rites and about mourning and enduring grief for those who have died young - I doubt that.", "[deleted]", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll so far down to read the only correct answer", "Much, much worse to hurt a grieving mother than use an unfortunately strong phrase toward a partner in a desperate moment. Even if he was mistaken that the mother was being hurt by his girlfriend, he didn't know that at the time and was acting in her best interest to reduce that hurt. He also wasn't TRYING to hurt his girlfriend, just stop her from doing harm, so if he apologizes for the language, she should try to forgive him.

I mean the point of the story was not archaeology, it was about a meaningful burial tradition to allow your loved ones to rest in peace. Obviously not everyone is going to like it, and rambling on is not very polite, but I find it very strange how people jump to calling her an asshole or a \u201chorrid story\u201d (as I saw another commentor call it), when it was (the way I see it) an honest attempt to comfort the family. And the fact is literally none of us know the family\u2019s true feelings on the story, because the mother didn\u2019t truly say or do anything to indicate her feelings, and OP told his partner to STFU before the father or brother said/did anything.", "An autistic person. I would've done the same thing because 1. I don't understand most social situations 2. Autistic people use knowledge as comfort. The story she told was about death and closeness. She probably thought she was comforting the mother. I am not saying shes autistic but I can see why she would've told such a story to someone grieving. Don't be so closed minded", "\u2026she was talking about a burial practice she had heard about that showed honor and respect to the deceased and brought meaning to their life. How is that disrespectful to someone in the midst of honoring a deceased loved one in their own way at a funeral?\n\nLike, it\u2019s possible they were bored/disinterested/even offended, but I wouldn\u2019t assume they were. Personally, I don\u2019t think I would have been. \n\nIn any case, whether she was misreading the room or he was, telling her to \u201cshut the f*ck up\u201c not only in public but in the middle of a funeral is gross and disrespectful.", "Thank you! I was reading all these comments going off on the girlfriend and I could not understand why. It didn\u2019t seem like the family was uncomfortable. And I also thought it was a lovely story, not about archaeology at all, but about a profound burial ritual honoring a beloved son. What could be more appropriate under those circumstances?  OP, you are such the AH. Way to let your girlfriend know you think she\u2019s an idiot, you don\u2019t respect her at all, and you naturally assume others don\u2019t either.", "Me too. I would have been comforted by this story at my grandmother\u2019s funeral last year. Also at the funeral people talked about all sorts of things, some funeral related, some related to my grandmother and some related to nothing except that the conversation had drifted there.", "Same here! I think it was a lovely story to tell at a funeral tbh, just...maybe not to the mother of the deceased on that exact day.\n\nMy husband created a tiny box that we all decorated and then he put his dad's favorite snack (popcorn) inside and put it inside the casket with my FIL so he'd have a little treat.\n\nThis story reminded me of it and I wish I'd heard it on the day of the funeral, there's something about grief and connecting to humanity even through the ages that is so comforting.", "Yes, in the infinite realm of inappropriate things this is at worst a mild offense borne of good intentions. Fwiw I also think it was an attempt to comfort. My only possible issue would be rambling for too long but I'm sure she wasn't the only person to do that under the circumstances.", "That still doesnt condone verbal abuse!", "He tried to get her to stop quietly, what she was doing is very inappropriate", "This.

Like adults.", "Yeah, that part was a bit much regardless of the intent.", "The mother may have appreciated the story - it talks about not just the science behind mourning, but that mourning is something inherent to humans. Some people find comfort in that sort of thing - the mother asked questions, and nothing OP said indicated that the mother was unappreciative.", "I didn\u2019t read that OP actually lost his temper.  When I read the description he wrote the way he said \u201c please\u201d at the end it sounded more like a desperate plea than an angry shout.  \n\nI guess to me it depends on his tone and how loud he was as to if I would change my vote. I\u2019m still staying with NTA.", "Yeah, idk to me it sounded like kind of a touching story.", "All of this!!!! I'm not saying shes autistic, but as an autistic woman myself, I know autistic people overly share things we find comforting in time of grief even if we don't realize its inappropriate.

Robot has been used to describe me and other autistic people I know.", "Stop being obtuse, if you're doing something and someone says \"please don't\" it's very clear they mean \"don't do what your currently doing\". Saying \"please don't\" could mean literally anything is just you purposely being ignorant to what it actually means", "And believe you me, I'm judging you for them.", "That is true, I will agree with you on that.  But I still get the vibe from the way he wrote this that her \u201cair dropping\u201d the article at the funeral and starting the long winded and obscure story all over again, OT was embarrassed and -as everyone has agreed -he is grieving his friend as well.  I read it as he said this (with a please at the end) In desperation not in anger.  Maybe if this was a sitcom scene, a good actor could have made that a (darkly) funny line?  \n\nCould he have handled it better? Absolutely!  Your ideas of saying \u201ccan I speak with you in private\u201d would have been much - much better.  But sometimes we screw up.

I must say as an avid stardew valley fan not only was I completely unaware of that sub, but I also was completely unaware how much I should hate Pierre (I put very little effort into the dialogue/friend characters I guess). Anyways, I just wanted to say thank you for opening my eyes to the much deserved hatred of Pierre, and I applaud you for your recent egging.

In that moment, OP was harsh, but it was also a strange interaction and conversation, very out of place, and a snap decision led to the \u201cstfu\u201d. Hm. I\u2019m conflicted. The whole situation just isn\u2019t great and OP should apologize and rebuild things. \n\nJust a word though OP: your fianc\u00e9 is not a computer program. She\u2019s human. Needs an apology.
