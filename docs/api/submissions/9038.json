The three of us met at college and we basically became buddies from the get go. None of us are archeologists by the way. Our BA was Business administration.\n\nA couple of weeks ago we were at George\u2019s funeral service, most of the time just us with his family. We were the only \u2018outsiders\u2019 there. Phoebe, completely out of the blue, started to talk about archaeology to George\u2019s mother.\n\n**TL;DR:** She started talking about some obscure South American indigenous mummies.\n\nIn detail, she talked about about an ancient native boy who was found buried with a purposefully punctured (broken) \u201cantara\u201d flute next to his mouth, that they called a \u201ckilled instrument\u201d as it was meant to never be played by anyone else, in the same way it was played once by its owner. The flute was made of stone called \u201ccombarbalita\u201d, which means it was meant to last through generations, so it had to be broken on purpose. She talked about a connection between the flute and its owner being buried together, and the idea that the instrument was willfully broken in order to bring the instrument closer to his owner in eternity, achieving immortality for both of them by that irreversible action of breaking an instrument that was meant to last forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m basically paraphrasing but that was the idea. I can use some of her fancy words because she literally air dropped the article she was talking about, right there at the service. I\u2019m wasting characters on this just so you know how obscure the conversation was.\n\nI get the idea. I get the intention. It is interesting\u2026 for a college class. In the context of a funeral for our dear friend, however, I thought it was out of pocket and sort of distasteful, disrespectful, to talk about that.\n\nGeorge\u2019s mother was polite and she asked some questions but she was mostly quiet just listening to Phoebe talking non-stop. Then, George\u2019s father and brother approached us and she was about to start to tell them the whole damn story once again. I quietly said \u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2026\u201d she was about to start rambling so I told her \u201cjust shut the f\\*ck up, please\u201d.\n\nShe didn\u2019t speak to me for that entire evening. We talked about it later, back in our place and I explained why I reacted that way. She said \u201c gotcha, you\u2019re fine\u201d but she has acted differently to me since that day. One of my friends told me that I \u2018broke\u2019 her and it does feel that way. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s a robot and her software it\u2019s malfunctioning. Tension is high for both of us and George\u2019s death hit us hard on both of us, so IDK if I\u2019m missing something. AITA?\n\n**Edit:** I\u2019m asking IF I AM the asshole here. **Don\u2019t call my fianc\u00e9 \u201ccrazy\u201d or derogatory words.** That\u2019s out of place and I\u2019m not here for that shit.

I even realize that you quietly tried to get her to stop, and she proceeded anyway. But the language you used to actually get her to stop was harsh.\n\nI also understand that some people ramble when they\u2019re nervous/uncomfortable, and this might have been her doing just that. However, it was not the time nor the place. And especially the fact it was the deceased friend\u2019s mother. That poor woman probably had enough going on in her head at the moment already.", "YTA and that you think it's okay to talk to her in that manner shows the relationship isn't nearly as good as you claim. I'd fully guess it was nerves. Just like some people laugh at funerals even when upset she seems to have word vomit. You could have easily guided her another direction away from his parents. Was her behavior rather off? Yes. But she wasn't purposefully being an asshole unlike you.", "YTA\n\n(A) she was probably pretty uncomfortable because funerals suck, (B) she was talking about something relating to immortality, which ties in to death, so it's not like the topic just came out of left field, (C) there were 101 ways to tell your girlfriend that it was not an appropriate time - and you still managed to pick the worst one.\n\n>She said \u201c gotcha, you\u2019re fine\u201d but she has acted differently to me since that day\n\nThis gives the same vibes as an AITA that I read awhile back.  The guy was complaining that his girlfriend was so excitable about a certain topic and wanted to talk about her day with him and told her as much, and then got all surprised pikachu face when girlfriend withdrew into herself and stopped sharing things with him.\n\nYou told your gf to \"shut the fuck up\", so she did - and now you want to be all \"I don't understand why she's being standoffish and quiet!\" \n\n> It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s a robot and her software it\u2019s malfunctioning\n\nYeah, it's also not great to refer to your girlfriend as an emotionless malfunctioning robot.", "YTA- I get what she was doing might be not the most appropriate in the moment but it was probably very uncomfortable and when people are uncomfortable sometimes they ramble about random things. There was zero reason for you to swear at her and tell her to shut up. You could have just quietly said \"maybe not now,\" or \"hey just don't talk about that right now please.\" Like the way you delivered that message was not okay and I wouldn't have been okay with my partner speaking like that to me in any context. She's mourning the loss of a friend and then her partner is swearing at her and telling her to shut up... that would make anyone feel like garbage. You have some apologizing to do", "YTA. Saying \"shut the fuck up\" to your fianc\u00e9e, at a funeral where you are both grieving a loss, was unnecessary. There are plenty of ways to disengage someone from a discussion, including simply leading them away with some excuse. \n\nI agree her topic was bizarre, but maybe George's mother mentioned something tangentially related and your fianc\u00e9e in her nervousness just started rolling. George's mother knew how to handle the situation far better than you, maybe you should have taken some social tips from her.", "YTA\n\nThis is so me, I get in an uncomfortable situation and just start rambling, and yes, usually about the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n\nLuckily I have my husband and he will usually leed me away by my arm (with an excuse to get coffee, food etc.) and he then tells me what I am doing.\n\nNever has he ever swore at me or talk to me in that way in front of other people.\n\nIf you want to save your relationship, you better apologize for your behavior and talk about a better way to handle it next time.", "NAH. I really don\u2019t get all these Y T A votes. Funerals just suck. \n\nI understand why she reacted the way she did; she was probably rambling because she felt awkward and uncomfortable. For your part, sure you could have phrased it a little nicer than just \u201cstfu\u201d but again, *you* also felt awkward and uncomfortable because that\u2019s just how funerals are. \n\nTalk to your gf, maybe apologize for your harsh phrasing, but don\u2019t be too hard on yourself or on her. Forgive yourselves, forgive each other, and move on.", "INFO: \n\nIs Phoebe neurodivergent and/or does she have any kind of history of speaking off-topic in this manner? Or was this entirely unexpected behavior for her?", "NTA if she was nervous and rambling but just because someone is nervous that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to be inappropriate at a funeral.", "So your fianc\u00e9e is rambling during a very uncomfortable time, instead of helping her get out of the situation, taking her arm and asking if she wants to get some coffee perhaps. You swear at her? Do you really need to ask if YTA?", "YTA Telling your partner to shut the eff up in any context, ever, is an AH move. Saying it in public? Double AH.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Phobe talking to the dead guy\u2019s mom about ancient burial practices was tone-deaf, but telling her to shut the eff up? Nope. No excuse.", "This is both ESH and NAH. Funerals are awkward, death is so complicated to navigate, especially when it's someone so young. You both handled it poorly, just in diametrically opposite ways.  Talk to her again, explain that you realize you shouldn't have said what you said the way you said it, but that you were also under a tremendous amount of stress and listening to her talking even more about death at a funeral was making you very uncomfortable, and you think you both need to extend some grace and understanding to each other.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, YOU deemed the topic disrespectful, you don\u2019t actually know that George\u2019s family thought the same and in fact they may have enjoyed the conversation, maybe even found it comforting in a way. You don\u2019t know.\n\nSecond of all, there was absolutely no need to tell her to shut the fuck up, at all. You could have politely excused the two of you and quietly explained to her in private why you thought the conversation wasn\u2019t appropriate but instead you were rude to her and embarrassed her in front of anyone who heard you say that.\n\nThird of all, given your description of your fianc\u00e9e, she seems like she could be on the neurodivergent spectrum. If that is the case then you have done one of the most crushing things you can do to a neurodivergent person which is completely shut them down when they\u2019re talking about a special interest. I suggest looking into the topic more and seeing for yourself if that sounds like your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nBut, regardless of whether or not she is neurodivergent, telling someone to shut the fuck up when they\u2019re talking is hugely disrespectful and of course she is going to act differently when you\u2019ve treated her like that. I suggest you apologise, extensively.", "Everyone deals with stress and mourning and such differently. It seems like you were concerned for others feelings and don't want them more upset then they were. \n\nYour fiance is kinda like me. I would have done the exact same thing if I had knowledge of cultures and their funeral traditions. \n\nShe was trying to comfort the mom. IMO it's way better than everyone coming up to you saying \"I'm sorry for your loss if you need anything I'm here\" 100x that day. \n\nThe mom understood your fiance was trying to help in a way. Your fiance was probably very nervous too. \n\nWhen my cat died I screamed in a way that you just know was complete loss. 10 minutes later I seemed fine. \n\nYou should not have told her to shut the fuck up though as others have said. \n\nDo you talk to her like that often? If it was a one time thing... maybe stress idk people's brains don't work when they are stressed out. \n\nBut if it's a regular thing you need to have a talk with her and apologize. That wasn't the right way to respond to her trying to help.", "YTA.  Your fianc\u00e9 was definitely being awkward, but you never tell your SO to STFU.  I've done it twice with my wife who I've been with for 15 years and she didn't talk to me for the rest of the day no matter how much I apologized. Buy her some flowers and apologize again.  Good luck", "YTA solely for the way you spoke to her. I get your point about her making you uncomfortable with her off-topic lengthy conversations. However, I also see how that could have been her reaction to an already uncomfortable situation to begin with. Funerals are a tough time, and maybe she didn't know what to say to the family and/or was nervous, which resulted in her behavior. You may have thought way more of it than his family did. The issue here is how you addressed it and the very disrespectful way you spoke to her. That was way more inappropriate and disrespectful than anything she did.", "i'm sorry, NTA - yeah, funerals are awkward and stressful. that does not mean you take those feelings out on *the mother of the deceased* in whatever way pops into your head. should you have steered her away at some point before this? probably, but. you didn't and your fiance's a grown ass adult who shouldn't need to be babysat or informed that talking up a random Wikipedia rabbit hole at a funeral to the mom of the person in the coffin is not the appropriate time or place. she didn't notice all the signs that George's mother wasn't in the mood, she didn't hear you when you told her to stop quietly.\n\ni do agree that it sounds like your fiance may be on the spectrum for neurodivergence if this is a thing that happens often but guess what. even if she were autistic, that's not an excuse.", "This is a hard one, I\u2019m going with NAH just a horrible stressful situation. She was info dumping on a grieving mother and you felt, not unreasonably, you needed to stop her. Her feelings are hurt because you made clear her weird reaction was inappropriate. But her behaviour was probably a stress reaction that she couldn\u2019t help and now she\u2019s mortified. All I can say is treat her kindly and I hope you can both start to heal, I\u2019m really sorry for your loss.", "YTA for the way you spoke to her and I think you know it. She\u2019s now probably wondering if she wants to tie herself for life to someone who talks to her that way. If you had taken her aside and said \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a topic we should be talking about at the funeral\u201d you would\u2019ve absolutely not been TA. But you verbally lashed out at her instead when she\u2019s also grieving. You really need to apologize for the way you spoke to her and have a serious conversation about this.", "I'll go with ESH but I think you more so. \n\nAs long as how it went down was how you explained it then yeah she was out of line with going on a rant about something that people didn't care about at the funeral. It does seem like an odd topic so I'm a little inclined to believe that you left something out explaining why she brought it up. It seems more likely that someone brought up a topic similar and she jumped on board and overdid it. But it was also her friend too so she is grieving and it's coming out in an awkward way.   \n\n\nBut the way you talked to her was wayyyyy too harsh. Especially the comment at the end comparing her to a robot. Like wtf is that.", "YTA. Your fiance seems socially awkward and she may just not have known what else to talk about. Since you're paraphrasing you may not have got the point of what she was trying to say and I don't know enough about archaeology to know what she was talking about but it was obviously about a loved child being buried by someone who cared about him.\n\nWhen you told her to \u201cjust shut the f\\*ck up, please\u201d you told her that you don't think what she has to say is worth hearing and that is why she is upset.", "YTA\n\nI get where she was going with that, and honestly it would have comforted me a whole lot more than the standard platitudes at my mom's funeral. I suspect the idea behind it resonated strongly with her and how she views your mutual friends death, and was sharing something deeply personal and very related to the context with his parents. You swearing at her was crappy, but what it was about was probably way worse if she was sharing it because it was deeply meaningful to her.", "YTA she might have lacked social awareness but you could have handled it much better. Try and make things right?", "YTA", "And you\u2019re still engaged? Wow. YTA.", "YTA for cutting her down that way, you could've easily pulled her aside and told her she was going on.", "YTA. Other comments have explained why really well. Gotta love a person willing to tell their loved one to \"shut the fuck up\" during a grief filled time.", "NTA. The subject of mummies and the gory details should not be a topic of conversation to a mom whose son is dead in the coffin. Your Fiancee is clueless. I'm not buying the stressful situation. It's common sense not to broach that subject and then have articles and stuff at a funeral.  You asked her to please stop but she was ready to go on her ill timed rant. You could have left the curse words out but I'm sure it was just a knee jerk reaction.  I don't see how that would break her.  She needs therapy if it did.  It may be just sadness since your college friend is gone. Give it some time.", "YTA she was nervous and talking weird stuff because her friend died, you could have told her to stop nicely, instead of being EXTREMELY rude out of nowhere, called her to the side and talked to her like \"honey, I don't think they want to hear about this subject right now\" man, you were an big AH good lord, she must be feeling grief, embarrassment, anger and confused at the same time. Poor woman, if you love her, do your best to fix it and make her feel better, apologize as much as necessary and think about her feelings before being rude like this again.", "YMBTA.  It may of been nice for your friend\u2019s mother to have a moment where there\u2019s another subject besides her dead son as she encounters a constant line of people who are expressing pity, sorrow, condolences as they confront what she has for days. \n\n\u2026but next time, if there is one, just squeeze her hand as a signal.", "ESH and you specifically for the language you used. \n\nSounds like you didn't even try to tell her nicely that what she was doing was inappropriate. She was out of line with her topic, but you should've addressed it in a nicer way.", "EDIT YTA\n\nOld Informationen request Did George play an instrument? The flute or any other instrument? Because that's an obvi connection if he did.", "ESH.  Yes, she should have known to shut the fuck up.  However, you could have found a nicer way to deliver the message.", "INFO: Can you tell us more about your cool archaeologist fiancee?", "NTA, she was being wild as fuck and, once called out for it, is acting like a child. It\u2019s typical for people on Reddit to completely back women for ANYTHING they do wrong. This was some real crazy shit she was doing. It is fine to say shut the fuck up to someone who needs to shut the fuck up. If she is this emotionally crazy to shut down over this then she is not the type of person you want to be with.", "dude, people cope in different ways and if the family didn't say anything, I don't understand why you had to be so rude.\n\nYTA, you need to learn to communicate and not to be a massive asshole.", "NTA. Not the place, not the time, and emotions involved with a funeral excuse your harshness.", "ESH\n\nApproach was wrong but appreciated. I had someone ramble at my moms funeral about another death that happened 20 years ago about a person they didn\u2019t even know personally. I just told them to leave me alone and allow me to grieve for my mother. They got red in the face and left crying \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I don\u2019t regret it and I told them so later. It was my mothers funeral and you were talking about someone you didn\u2019t even know death and I didn\u2019t want to hear it. I had already told you, okay can we end the conversation and you continued so I snapped. Not my best moment but I was so relieved when they left. I\u2019m the oldest and I still had so much on my mind, plus people still needed to give well wishes. She was making my sister cry because of the story. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

Yikes) has just died, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect George\u2019s mother to take the time and effort to \u201cinterpret\u201d what this stranger (it sounds like the deceased parents didn\u2019t really know Pheobe or OP well) is telling her in a rather long winded story with many \u201cfancy\u201d words. \n\nThe way I interpret the situation the mother\u2019s husband and other son were coming over to \u201crescue\u201d their wife/mother from this situation they observed.  Which was Pheobe monopolizing George\u2019s mother at the FUNERAL with a long winded story.  Rather than read the room, Pheobe doubled down and started all over again.  \n\nI can definitely see myself using the same language as OP in this situation.   \n\nIn reading OP\u2019s edit, it sounds like he very much cares about Pheobe and their relationship.   Maybe it\u2019s time for another heart to heart talk about the situation.  Instead of being mad, Pheobe could be quiet now because she feels embarrassed about how she behaved at the funeral.  \n\nMy husband and I don\u2019t fight very often and swearing at each other is certainly not our norm.  However, after 36 years of marriage there has been a few times one of us has said something similar to the other such as what OP said to Pheobe.   What\u2019s important is how you handle the aftermath when things have cooled down.", ">It definitely was more than a \u2018creepy archaeologist\u2019 story.\n\nThat's what you heard but clearly I'm not the only one to see it your GF's way. Maybe it's because you're grieving and you were looking for someone to lash out at. But no matter what you were rude for no reason. No one was uncomfortable but you. Even if they were you don't have to be a dick.", "Yes you did. To her face. Around a bunch of other people. You just used different words. Funny you're being so defensive when this guy is basically parroting you. Go apologize to your gf and never speak to or about her like that again.", "Yes, sir, right away sir. You just shuffle back to the home that I\u2019m sure is so hospitable for you now, with the woman you called a robot and told to shut the fuck up.", "I\u2019m not talking about interpreting after reflection. I\u2019m saying not everyone would take this the same way. \n\nOP is assuming how George\u2019s mother felt about it based on he felt about it.\n\nMaybe Phoebe is being quiet bc she\u2019s embarrassed. Or because she\u2019s hurt. We\u2019ll see."]}
