{"id": 1755, "submission_id": "yp1pos", "title": "WIBTA for filing a complaint against a luxury store sales associate/the company?", "selftext": "I recently bought a luxury belt for my bf as a gift. I went into the store and gave the Sales Associate, let's call her Lily, his pants size and she helped me pick out a belt. I told him he was a 36 and she helped me pick out a size 38. She was really nice and packed up/wrapped the gift for me. I didn't even unwrap it before I gave it to him 2 weeks later. When my bf received it, he tried it on and it was way too short, so we decided to go back to the store to exchange it. \n\nWhen we went back to the store to exchange it the next, Lily was there to help us out again. She let me know that they can't take the belt back because it has been cut. I was super confused as we did not cut the belt (literally don't even know how to do this). We kept telling her this but she insisted that she also did not cut the belt and did not sell it to me that short. She even measured it in front of me to tell me what a size 38 is supposed to be and the belt was short. I asked if the belt may have been returned by another customer before I bought it and she assured me that they do not resell belts that were returned (this is weird but ok) I was really annoyed at this point as it was a super expensive belt and she was accusing us of cutting it. What was more annoying is that she kept saying \"I'm not accusing you of cutting it but it wasn't this short when I sold it to you\" like who tf cut it then??? I asked her what we could do about it and she went to the back and eventually came back out and let us know that she will take the exchange this one time (like she was doing us a favor). \n\nSo we started to look at other belts on the wall that were on display, we saw a similar belt that was size 38 and my bf started to try it on. The belt was again too short. It was only this style that was too short tho, the other styles fit him fine at size 38. We brought this up to Lily and she mentioned it was a manufacturing error and she measured another belt in the back that was the same size/style and it's the same measurement as the one we are returning. \n\nSo this women knew it was a manufacturing error yet made it seem like she was doing us a favor by accepting our exchange??? I was super pissed off that she didn't even mention that to us and accused of cutting the belt. She never apologized, but she was trying to be nice and we just did an exchange for a longer belt and left. I'm still really annoyed with this incident and want to file a complaint to corporate.

Either her branch has ordered and already paid for this merchandise (stuck with it)so her manager is making her sell it;  or she doesn't want to lose a commission.  I suggest you contact corporate.  So, so NTA.", "NTA - the knowingly tried to mislead you and make you doubt yourself. The fact that she accused you cutting the belt despite knowing about the manufacturing error leads me to believe this isn\u2019t the first time its happened. I\u2019d report her just to ensure proper action may be taken against her in the future!", "NTA - She literally accused you of an issue she was aware of, go hog wild on reporting her.", "NTA. If I was in that situation, I would have named and shamed, even if I didn't file a complaint. She should have apologized when she realised that it's a manufacturing defect. Mistakes happen, manufacturing defects can happen. But she wrongly accused you of tampering with the product, so when she realised that it wasn't your mistake, she should have apologized. It was her fault for barking without verifying her claims and even if she did that, she should have atleast apologized.", "NTA - She effectively gaslit you over this. You should have gotten a refund and taken your business elsewhere. Complain away", "NTA\n\nFile the complaint with Corporate. Actually, they may welcome the feedback - maybe a factory has the wrong measurement, maybe they're not paying attention, who knows? But they need to know.\n\nI'd do it as a complaint against the style of belt. Not sure it's worth getting this woman potentially fired - once she realized it was a manufacturing error, she let you exchange it, right?", "Nta. You are disappointed  in the merchandise. You have a receipt. Should be no issue. Being an exchange it would not affect her commission", "I\u2019m gonna go on a limb and assume this is Gucci. Yeah, call and complain. They know there\u2019s an manufacturing error and trying to pass them off instead of returning them to corporate.\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA. Lily was dishonest and it could have cost you money.\n\nGo ahead with the complaint and make sure to include any extra evidence you may have like pictures of the belt labeled as being a size 38 but being too short.\n\nI'm sure it's not the stores first issue with this and it would be helpful to call their attention to it in case other customers haven't already.", "NTA.  This was the opposite of good business from start to finish.  Now, she may have been under pressure from management to keep returns down, so I'd make sure the complaint addresses management's duty to create a store culture that cultivates customer loyalty.  That means taking the returns with a smile; not making excuse after excuse --- especially if the 2nd excuse contradicts the 1st!  (And mention that their response to your complaint will be included in their Yelp review)", "NTA. Absolutely complain. If not for you, then for those that have to come in after you", "NTA. Should have called her ass out and asked for management and told them in front of her.", "NTA I\u2019d file a complaint. Sounds like she knows but still trying to sell them instead of damage them out or return to manufacturer. Worse she tried to pull a fast one on you.", "\u2026NTA I guess but is this really worth your time?", "Let this go. Problem got fixed and everyone learned something merging. Things aren\u2019t always marked right", "Let it go.  Sales associates have a tough job dealing with the public and honestly...she may now have known there was a manufacturing error and trying to make up things as she went just to try to appease the situation.  Complaining is for your own gratification as you even said she was stellar the first time you met her and in the end things were fixed, so why complain?

It sounds like she only found out it was a manufacturing error right before she told you. \n\nAnd NAH because she really wasn't calling you a liar, she was just confronted with a very unexpected scenario. But yeah you *should* contact the company and let them know that they're selling flawed merchandise and their exchange policy isn't great.\n\nI wouldn't blame the associate though. She doesn't sound like she was trying to be rude, she sounds like she was navigating a difficult situation where she was trying to help you without getting in trouble for doing an exchange her boss would object to. She made the effort to figure out the issue. And in your own words she was trying to be nice. So even though it upset you, maybe take the high road on this one.", "WBTA, just move on , don\u2019t return to the store  . If you must give maybe a bad review, at the end she did something about the problem .", "YTA if the associate can\u2019t help, talk to a manager/lead about it next. Harping and arguing with a store associate is just worthless/wasted energy.\n\nYou\u2019re assuming she\u2019s being deceitful, more likely it\u2019s memory lapse or this is what she\u2019s been told to do with those belts.", "~~YTA~~ ESH - you for exchanging the belt rather than getting a refund. The salesperson for obvious reasons.\n\nEdit to change to ESH. The salesperson doesn\u2019t deserve a pass.", "Move on with your life. You got the outcome you wanted, and while she was annoying, you don\u2019t ever have to deal with her again. Stop looking for compensation for your hurt feelings - yes she was out of line, but just take the high road.", "NTA but honestly, is it even really worth your time and effort?  I'd just move on with life, better ways to spend your time.", "What this salesperson did was wrong wrong wrong.\n\nBut you know what? Life's way too short. Let it go", "I def said something along those lines! It was a frustrating convo. At some point I was also nervous security would kick us out of the store :(", "I don't think that OP should have gone to a different store, because OP definitely likes the brand, and why should she change her loyalty to the brand/product/services because of a single employee working there. OP  liked the belt she bought, she even liked the replacement belt, so I don't see why she should stop going to the store. OP is not wrong, atleast I don't think she is. Next time, she can ask for a different sales associate (if possible).", "This store doesn\u2019t do refunds. It\u2019s exchanges only which I was aware of when I made the purchase", "When you reward awful customer service, they have no reason to change. I prefer not to give my business to people who treat me like shit, but you do you.", "I'd personally refuse to give them my custom, I'm sure other stores have nice belts, but I accept your point. Sure it's one employee but if I can go elsewhere and not have the same issue I'd rather support the store with the better staff (that I have a more pleasant experience with).", "Depending on where you are, local laws may require them to make a refund because the item you purchased was defective/misrepresented. Don\u2019t just assume you are bound by store policy, particularly when dealing with this particular salesperson.", "You are assuming that the higher ups know about the customer service. Like, you won't stop using Uber or food delivery service or Amazon if one driver or delivery agent behaved badly with you. You will complain and let them handle it. Since OP is talking about a luxury brand they should have right protocols in place for these scenarios. Personally, I won't let one sales associate make me stop frequenting some establishment that I like. Moreover, they will have surveillance systems, so the higher ups can verify OP's claims as well.", "NTA soft. Belts like shoes, and clothes run large, small, or just right. Every manufacture is different. Sales should have admitted they are running small. On her side may not have known. Being nasty a sorry would have been nice.", "YTA, it sounds like she figured this out at the same time you did and she was trying to follow policy. If you have a beef it's with the store or manufacturer not the sales rep.", "In men's sizes belts should not run long or short, it's a straight measument of inches."]}
