(I\u2019m gay)\n\nSo for a little background, me and my best friend met when we were in 4th grade and have been inseparable since. We have had so many classes together, done so many things together and have been there for each other through everything. Her grandmother passing, my parents separating, I mean she\u2019s my rock. Everytime we were going through a rough patch in our own lives, we would always be an open ear to the other and knew how to make the other feel better.\n\nMy bsf, who we will call Katie now (fake name obv) has always been the kinda person to ask for advice, and then end up doing what she wants anyway. Whenever she met this guy, her now fianc\u00e9, she would ask me what I thought. I guess the \u201cbest friend test.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a judgemental person, but I pick up on vibes. and this guy gave me major homophobe vibes. I picked it up from the first time I met him. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt because Katie normally had a good judge of character, and he made her happy. I\u2019m not very feminine, so he never liked me because he always thought I was after his woman. He never believed it when either of us said I said I didn\u2019t swing that way. \n\nAs time went on I guess he wasn\u2019t as worried about me, and got more comfortable, and he said some out of pocket things. Subtle gay jokes here and there at first, then blatant remakes about how 2 men shouldn\u2019t be together, how the Bible says \u201cAdam and Eve not Adam and Steve,\u201d how 2 guys can\u2019t properly raise kids. And honestly every rebuttal to gay marriage under the sun. Katie didn\u2019t seem to acknowledge any of these remarks, despite me bringing them to her attention. \n\nSo here\u2019s the situation. Katie is getting married next month and I\u2019m supposed to be the man of honor. But I fell like I would be doing a disservice to myself if I attended, seeing as she\u2019s marrying someone who doesn\u2019t support my existence, and I\u2019m not sure what his thoughts on me even being there even are. I honestly don\u2019t want to be there, and I hope this wedding falls through. I haven\u2019t expressed these emotions to her yet, as I don\u2019t want to ruin it for her. im afraid if I do it would push her away. But I\u2019m also afraid if I don\u2019t and go through with it, I would lose my best friend anyway. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA? Should I cut my losses?

Ask her flat out: \"Are you OK with the homophobic things he says or not?\" If she claims she's not, \"Then why are you marrying someone like that?\" No more dancing around it -- make her admit it out loud. She'll either realize her mistake or she'll lose a friend, but that's on her.", "NTA. Honestly, skipping her wedding isn\u2019t what will drive her away, it\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s marrying someone who doesn\u2019t accept your existence. I\u2019m so sorry OP, your friendship is on its way out whether you attend or not.", "NTA, but you shouldn't be friends with someone who would be with someone like that.  Even if you weren't gay.....he's deplorable, and she is as well by association and tacit approval.  You should no longer have anything to do with either of them.", "NTA, as for your friend who you've known since you were literal kids, I'm quite disgusted she would go for someone with morals that would actively hurt and be bigoted towards those close to her. Don't put yourself where you're not comfortable, her fiancee has dug this hole if he gives two shits he can try to dig his way out.", "NTA regardless of what you do. It's not you ruining her wedding and you pushing her away. It's her risking the friendship and pushing you away. She'll wanting to marry a guy who she KNOWS doesn't approve of who are. She has massively failed the ally test here. That's the reality, as sad as it is. And now it's up to you to decide what you want to do about it. \n\nIt's easy to be supportive in a vacuum. It's when there are tough choices to make that we really learn a person's character.", "NTA. Don't go where you will not be welcome. I am sorry, but this sounds like a recipe for disaster.\n\nTalk to your and explain as gently as you can why this is a problem. \n\nThe other thing to consider is that if the groom is homophobic, what are the chances that his friends and family will be also? This could turn into a dangerous situation for you. Please be careful.", "NO, NTA. I told my gays (both not super feminine at all) I would absolutely not get married in a church because I found that it was disrespectful to them (they didn\u2019t care but it was absolutely important to have both of them attend) which is likely one of the reasons why my ex and I broke it off.\n\nI can tell you my current partner loves my friends (gay couple) and we enjoy being with them. He has never ever made comments like that.\n\nYour friend should stick up for you and you should expect her future partner to accept it and move along.\n\nBb, you\u2019ll learn that friends even grow apart and it\u2019s okay. Also, come be friends with us! \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA - but you are going to be one if you don\u2019t talk to her NOW. The wedding is next month?! And you, the man of honor, are considering bowing out??? You need to tell her asap. \n\nThat being said - as a queer person myself\u2026 yeah\u2026 she\u2019s not your friend if she\u2019s marrying someone like that, and doesn\u2019t defend you. I hate to say that, but I had to cut ties with a friend I\u2019ve had for over a decade for the same thing. \n\nSaw someone say something recently, and I\u2019m gonna paraphrase it - If nine people are sitting at a table with a homophobe and none of them speak against the homophobe, then there are 10 homophobes sitting there. \n\nHer inaction is condoning the way he talks and his opinions. It\u2019s made him braver and braver to say that kind of thing to you, because she doesn\u2019t stop him. \n\nThat is not your friend. I\u2019m so sorry, I know you love her and you\u2019ve been friends for so long. But she\u2019s decided to join her life with someone who *doesn\u2019t think you have the right to exist.* \n\nThat is not you friend anymore. She\u2019s not a safe person for you. And what happens if/when they have kids? Do you honestly think someone like the fianc\u00e9 is going to allow his kids to be around you? Do you think she\u2019s going to stand up for you then, when she has so much more to lose, when she\u2019s not standing up for you now? \n\nYou deserve so much better.", "How the fuck did you let this get to a month?", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry hun, but you\u2019ve already lost your best friend. You lost her a while ago. Because a person who tolerates homophobia from a partner, is a homophobe too. Her desire to get male validation was stronger than your friendship.", "NTA, but.  First, I'm sorry, but you're losing your best friend. \n\nIf you bail on the wedding, she will hate you and blame you for everything. I actually advise you to go through with it, be the man of honor, and then pull back and spend less time with Katie, more time with others. That way you're not burning the bridge with Katie, and if she wises up and gets divorced, you can potentially be close friends again.", "NTA. Don't put yourself into a situation where you will not be comfortable.  You do not need to waste one second of your life in the presence of AH like this.", "NTA. Cut your losses with the both of them. That is not your friend, I\u2019m sorry. The fact that she knowingly married a homophobe with you as her friend is just gross, it shows she doesn\u2019t care about you.", "I am struggling with this one only because you already agreed and the wedding is next month. I would have no problem if you hadn\u2019t agreed or the wedding was farther out. It\u2019s rude to pull out now but it is awful of Katie to be marrying someone who clearly thinks very differently from her. \n\nPlease also consider that if you won\u2019t fulfill your obligation, her husband will be able to drive a big wedge between you and Katie by saying you didn\u2019t care enough to be her man of honor. He will be thrilled to be able to destroy your friendship.", "NTA you\u2019re in a lose lose situation. I would prepare for the inevitable friendship break.", "Sorry the way you titled this made it sound like him being a homophobe was a positive lol", "Esh. Her for being with a homophobe but why on earth did you accept being man of honor? And you want to now dip a month before? You shouldn\u2019t have accepted in the first place and have just made everything way worse", "I was asked to be the MOH for my best friend nearly 20 years ago. I despised the guy she was marrying. He cheated constantly, treated her like shit, I mean BAD. I talked with her about it numerous times, begged her not to marry him. She went ahead with it, and so did I. I regret it to this day. I never should have supported that. He abused her to the brink of suicide before she left him and 5 years ago. She's a shell of the woman she was. I've apologized a million times for not putting my foot down and essentially \"giving my blessing\" by standing at their wedding. \n\nPlease don't do it. You'll regret it.", "As an anti-homophobe, don't support it.\n\nBut I'm also befuddled by his perspective on this. He, as a homophobe, is fine with a gay man in a prominent position in his wedding? I feel like this is a thing he's \"allowing\" his future wife, which sounds like it'll only get worse for her.\n\nMy prediction is she cuts you off now, but may come for help in 6 months. Skip the \"I told you so\" and prep for it.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you told her about the problems and she doesn\u2019t care.  She is actively supporting the same position by doing so.  Think you lost your friend and it\u2019s time to move on.  I would drop out and let her know why.  She owes you apology to remain your friend.", "NTA\n\nBut talk to her about your feelings and your concerns. You ultimately have to do what you think is right, but you should tell your friend everything going through your mind.", "NTA.  It sounds like you feel you would be betraying yourself if you stood as man of honor, which to me is worse than any offense your friend might feel.  Katie still chooses this guy despite his bigotry, and whether she is blinded by love or stupidity, it doesn't mean you should tolerate it.  I think you should respect your own values and tell Katie you aren't comfortable taking that role, but you still love her as friend and want her to be happy.  If you can bear attending the ceremony, then go as a guest.  Choose a nice gift with her in mind and wish her well.  You can return to being her support person during the divorce.", "What\u2019s that phrase - those who do nothing in the face of injustice, side with the abuser? People who don\u2019t stand up for what is right, or at the very least stand up for people they care about, are just gross people. She\u2019s choosing to ignore it. I would have a hard time staying friends with someone so passive about this. NTA.", "NTA. If she marries him, that's the end of your friendship. She can't be married to a homophobe and be besties with a homosexual, it just doesn't work that way.", "NTA. Marry a homophobe, are a homophobe. It\u2019s that simple, your friend is a homophone.\n\nEdit: homophobe not homophone", "Even just from the first two lines NTA lol.\n\nTypical type to ignore red flags of their partner, and later sadly come to regret it.\n\nI hope not but these type of bigoted guys usually end up also having bigoted views on women and don't treat their wives well...", "NTA. This makes her complicit with homophobia.", "NTA. Anyone who marries a homophobe IS a homophobe. Tell her you will be there for her if she ever leaves him or if he has an epiphany that turns him into an ally. Yeah, like the latter is likely.\n\nDon't go to the wedding. Don't spend any time with her, whether the asshole is there or not. If she complains, she's reaping what she sowed.\n\nMy sympathies on your loss, but you *have* lost her. Better to acknowledge that now than to drag it out.", "NTA\n\nAnd tell your friend why..  be aware, that shes not deaf..  shes chosen to stay with him knowing his opinions, so...  odds are this will be the end of your friendship..\n\nWhatever you do, dont stay silent...\n\nBest of luck..", "NTA at all but If you don\u2019t like or support both people, then please don\u2019t attend the wedding and stop communication w the friend. Its clear who she\u2019s choosing to be with. Not really the type of person you need in your life. Not sure why she\u2019s marrying someone like that. Kinda sad if they have kids they will prob learn that same mentality. But at the end of the day people are people and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. I would just move on.", "You are definitely NTA.  There is no reason you should be put into a situation with someone who is so abusive.  I\u2019m sorry your friend does not seem to notice that you are being bullied and abused.  This may be the end of the relationship but you aren\u2019t being supported and best friends support each other.", "NTA.\n\nIf it takes something that drastic to make her understand, so be it. If she still doesn't get it I'd take the loss and move on. It's going to suck rocks either way but you are not going to that wedding.", "Your reasoning not to attend is completely justified but YWBTA if you just pulled out without being direct with Katie first, especially this close to the wedding. \n\nYou need to tell her straight up how uncomfortable her future husband makes you feel and ensure she realises her tolerance of his behaviour could end your long-term friendship.", "NTA. She made her choice and you will make new, better friends. And for the people telling you to go, no. It\u2019s not your job to enlighten or fix her.", "NTA but you would be an asshole if you wait to tell her until after she\u2019s married. Even if it ends her relationship it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier to do than a divorce. If your fears are true and worse case scenario your friendship ends it will be because she is actively choosing a homophobe over life long best friend, which is that really any better than being homophobic herself because I don\u2019t see much of a difference.", "NTA. Don\u2019t go. Katie needs to reconcile her desire to stay with this guy with the homophobe she knows he is. But you don\u2019t have to subject yourself to his hostility while she figures herself out.", "NTA. It must be very hard to watch your best friends marry a guy like that.\n\nI do want to say that if he is being so blatantly homophobic, and specifically calling on the Bible to justify it, i wouldn't be surprised if he is still putting on an act for your friend. Once they're married and he has her, in his mind, \"trapped\", he will start showing even more of his real self to her. And she will really need the love and support of her friends then. Standing up for her at the wedding despite the homophobe will prove to her that you have her back no matter what, even when she's making a mistake.\n\nETA, OP, your friend is probably being seriously manipulated by homophobic, sexist. She probably doesn't feel safe, even just emotionally, calling her fiance out.", "NTA what so ever \n\nKatie doesn\u2019t deserve you being the man of honor nor does she deserve to be your friend", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable  attending either. However, this choice is bigger than the wedding, so please make sure that you are comfortable with your decision. Your will be effectively ending your friendship if you decide not to go. I\u2019m sorry that your friend is putting you in this situation.", "nta tbh katie doesnt seem like a greatfriend if you, her best friend, are gay, andshe's marrying a homophobe", "NTA - by supporting him she is homophobic too", "NTA If she does marry him its only going to get worse, especially if they have kids.", "Since she's enabling him, she's as much of a homophobe as he is. NTA but this relationship has been over for a while and I think you just haven't faced it.", "NTA but why are you still friends with Katie? If someone marries/dates a homophobe, they are a homophobe, period.", "NTA. If I were to fall for a guy and he started bigoted shit it would be an instant deal breaker. Your friend made her choice and now she has to deal with the consequences. Why did you wait this long though?", "Standing at that altar next to her signals that you give credence to her marrying that reprehensible piece of trash. \n\nDon't go.

Walk out and let it all burn.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Follow your heart and your best instincts. \n\nIt's unfortunate that you'll likely lose this friendship.  It's up to you to determine how quickly.  \n\nYour BFF isn't blind or ignorant to her husband's attitude towards you.  She loves him, and specifically loves him in a more prevailing way than she loves you. That's okay and it can be fair as much as unfair. You'll always be an important part of her life, but he's her man- the love of her life, if she's lucky and they're good to each other. Over time, unless she determines to keep you close in her life despite his attitude, expect the distance between you to grow due to his influence.  \n\nAs a fellow gay man, I feel for you, but your abiding friendship can only matter so much as to how her heart moves. And he might otherwise be a good guy, at least for her, despite his misgivings.  \n\nThe best advice I can give is to sit down and be honest with her about your concerns. Understand it might upset her- she's asking for your support on the most important day of her life so clearly you mean a lot to her, but it's unrealistic to assume that you mean *so much* that she would consider not building a life with the guy (if he checks all the right boxes for her except the one that affects you personally).  Some dudes can just be antagonistic (alpha chest thumping behavior), just picking at you. But she still asked you; if he were really against it, either they'd be fighting or one of them would cave.  If he caved, it's because she fought for you to be a part of this with her, and won. \n\nBut being there for her in this way may be the best gift you can give her (and maybe your friendship with her might soften his stance, too often people act out because they don't know queer folk and once they spend time with us begin to see us as just people and more than their fears and distastes).  If this marriage ultimately drives you apart, one last celebration to bid farewell could be considered a mercy, and kinder on both of you than quitting her cold turkey and condemning her for something out of your control.  And accept that this marriage isn't about you.  Be there *for her because you love her*.  Don't punish her for loving someone who doesn't see eye to eye with you. I fear that if you decide not to support her because of him, you'll justify his support of you not being friends with her (if that's the case).", "2 paths are available,  1 you go and flaunt yourself,  me extra gay, maybe bring a guy who doesn't like shirts that fit.\n\n2 don't go cause that guys an ass and possibly actually gay", "Yes, you are TA", "Info- have you had an actual discussion with her about this at all during her dating/ engagement?\n\nIf not... then you'd be the AH to back out now.", "Weddings are for the bride everyone knows that.

(I\u2019m gay)\n\nSo for a little background, me and my best friend met when we were in 4th grade and have been inseparable since. We have had so many classes together, done so many things together and have been there for each other through everything. Her grandmother passing, my parents separating, I mean she\u2019s my rock. Everytime we were going through a rough patch in our own lives, we would always be an open ear to the other and knew how to make the other feel better.\n\nMy bsf, who we will call Katie now (fake name obv) has always been the kinda person to ask for advice, and then end up doing what she wants anyway. Whenever she met this guy, her now fianc\u00e9, she would ask me what I thought. I guess the \u201cbest friend test.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a judgemental person, but I pick up on vibes. and this guy gave me major homophobe vibes. I picked it up from the first time I met him. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt because Katie normally had a good judge of character, and he made her happy. I\u2019m not very feminine, so he never liked me because he always thought I was after his woman. He never believed it when either of us said I said I didn\u2019t swing that way. \n\nAs time went on I guess he wasn\u2019t as worried about me, and got more comfortable, and he said some out of pocket things. Subtle gay jokes here and there at first, then blatant remakes about how 2 men shouldn\u2019t be together, how the Bible says \u201cAdam and Eve not Adam and Steve,\u201d how 2 guys can\u2019t properly raise kids. And honestly every rebuttal to gay marriage under the sun. Katie didn\u2019t seem to acknowledge any of these remarks, despite me bringing them to her attention. \n\nSo here\u2019s the situation. Katie is getting married next month and I\u2019m supposed to be the man of honor. But I fell like I would be doing a disservice to myself if I attended, seeing as she\u2019s marrying someone who doesn\u2019t support my existence, and I\u2019m not sure what his thoughts on me even being there even are. I honestly don\u2019t want to be there, and I hope this wedding falls through. I haven\u2019t expressed these emotions to her yet, as I don\u2019t want to ruin it for her. im afraid if I do it would push her away. But I\u2019m also afraid if I don\u2019t and go through with it, I would lose my best friend anyway. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA? Should I cut my losses? Im at a loss right now\u2026\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ergh, no one needs to be around homophobes, good for you for putting yourself first.\n\nBut I gotta say - you're not really making a decision in your friendship, she is; what, she hasn't *noticed* he's a homophobe? C'mon, she knows but either she's in deep with him, or she's passive and weak enough to see it but not care. \n\nPerhaps leave a door open, but keep your distance. Though, if you can, tell her how you feel bluntly - that in itself will let you know what's up with her, and if she is in fact in line with him or... perhaps she doesn't feel like she *can* go against him.", "NTA. OP, you've already lost your best friend. Her fiance makes a mockery of gay marriage through jokes, and your best friend says nothing. The jokes are what's said to your face. I'm pretty sure he's says worse when he's with his boys.", "NTA. You don't like the man she's marrying and can't support the wedding, but agreeing to be MOH when you hate him and won't support the wedding and still haven't told her is a giant asshole thing to do. If you aren't doing it and if she goes through with it, then she deserves to find a replacement who can get up to speed on plans and have the best wedding they can.\n\nThe fact is if she goes through with it and spends her life with a homophobe, she's pretty much ending her friendship with you anyway.\n\nShe can pretend he doesn't say these things or she can stand up to him for what she believes in. The question becomes, are you a friend who's gay status is grandfathered in but she's not particularly open to other gay people?", "NTA.  Why would you go to a wedding for someone who doesn't believe you have the right to do the same?", "NTA.  You really need to sit down with her and tell her how you feel.  Sooner the better, she needs to plan to replace you in the wedding party.  I'm surprised her fiancee is even allowing you to be the Man of honour, given his homophobia.  You also don't know what kind of reception you will get at the wedding from  his family.  If you don't feel safe, you shouldn't go.  She will understand if she's your best friend.  She already knows what he's saying is wrong, so I can't see that it would be a surprise to her.  Don't let her guilt you either.  She's known you much longer than she's known him, she should be standing up for her bestie!", "NTA. Your comfort and safety comes first. If the soon-to-be husband is that comfortable making those kind of jokes in front of his partner\u2019s gay friend, I cannot imagine what he would be comfortable with doing in private. Absolutely disgusting behavior, do not go to that wedding. Don\u2019t even apologize for not going. She\u2019s honestly not the best person for ignoring the remarks to begin with and is fostering an unsafe environment.", "NTA.  I am deeply sorry you're in this position. \n\nYou are not obligated to stand up beside  your friend and smile while she marries someone who doesn't even accept your existence. \n\nI'm an old straight broad, likely in your parents age group and I am disgusted with Katie right now.  If she were my daughter,  we'd have already had some serious discussions about the bigotry and about the more general issue of how important it is for partners to have values that are compatible.  Not necessarily the same,  but not in direct contrast,  either.   I probably would have managed to run this fianc\u00e9 off early on, just by being vocal in my support of LGBTQ rights (and a slew of other positions he probably considers \"woke\")\n\nYou CAN and should ask Katie why she's ok with the homophobic garbage.  Don't just bring it to her attention,  insist on an answer.  \n\n(By the way,  there are no rebuttals to marriage equality- every last argument they make is just another way of saying \"but I think it's icky\", which is not a valid counterpoint in a discussion of human rights)", "You can drop out of the wedding...but it would likely permanently damage your friendahip, if not terminate it completely. If you are good with losing a lifelong friend over her first husband (and I would guess someone who sees the world so differently than her will be temporary,) then, yes...skip it.\n\nNTA...no matter which choice you make.", "NTA, do you really want these people in your life?", "NTA\nIt is disgusting she would associate with trash like that. \nI'm a hetero (f) but there are things that would make me fall out of love or end the relationship (friends, lovers or whatever) that are racist and homophobes.\nSorry this happened to you, maybe that's how far your friendship gets...\nAnd is not on you but in her willingness to ignore that behavior from his partner when her best friend is gay. (Even if you weren't is disgusting associate with that kind of people)", "NTA. It stinks, but nice people sometimes choose horrible people to marry, and then become alienated from their friends and family.  It is up to you whether or not you attend the wedding, but know that if you dont go, your friendship will suffer, and possibly end.", "NTA you deserve a better friend", "NTA. You don't want to go. Stand for yourself. No means no.", "NTA\n\nEither she's completely oblivious to the obvious homophobia, She doesn't respect you enough to interfere or she's a closet homophobe herself. Whatever the (shitty) reason is, she doesn't respect you. Someone who actually supported you and other queer people would pick up on that real quick. It shouldn't have even escalated to the point of blatant remarks\n\nThough, I'd make it *very* clear why you aren't attending. Tell her you've put up with it, but you aren't going to be wasting time and energy into a friendship when she can't even do the bare minimum of maintaining the most basic level of safety and support. Like this is not ultra complicated ethics or a moral dilemma. It could not be more cut and dry.\n\nI can imagine this is tough however, you've known her for a long time, so you probably know there is at least some part of her that did accept you. If you can say that on some level you two can come back from this, I'd consider telling her you're open to talk, but only when she's ready to stop caring for someone who hates others for existing as they are. People that are openly homophobic don't end up like that because they're nice to people. It's not only possible, but quite likely that your friend is being abused in some capacity. It's pretty odd that someone you consider to be a best friend does literally 0 to support you and he feels emboldened to act that way.", "NTA.  \nI couldn't attend that wedding given those circumstances.  \nIf you feel you can talk to her about it? Do so.\n\nBut if you can't talk to her? I'd write her a letter and just tell her you cannot attend her wedding as the person she is marrying is a homophobe and she appears to be happy to ignore this. \n\nHe sounds awful and if Katie truly is a decent person? Then I can't imagine this will be a happy marriage anyway.", "fwiw...there are sadly many times in life where you have to make the choice to be principled or not. Not same situation, but the other day a post in here was asking about what to do as her bestfriend was having an affair with a married man? Me? See I would have to break off that friendship because in my ethical framework? I can't be friends with anyone who openly enters into a affair with a married man!\n\nThis is similar. Your friend Katie. is openly okay with marrying a man who is clearly homophobic. when one of her best friends is homosexual. That is just NOT soemthing I could ever condone. I'm no fabulous person. BUT...if anyone ever displays homophobia and I hear it? I challenge them and tell them it's unacceptable and I will not tolerate it. And yes. I have lost a few \"friends\" over the years. I didn't realise they were homophobic I guess when I became friends with them. But I am fine \"defriending\" them as this is a value and principle of mine that I will never compromise on. Same as racism. Just NOPE.\n\nAnd like others have said? By Katie not speaking up and challenging her fiance and even continuing to want to marry a person with such abhorrent views? I would wonder if Katie was even the person I thought she was? Very sad situation to me.", "Why would your \u201cbest friend\u201d want to spend her life with someone who denies your right to exist? \ud83e\udd14 I\u2019m thinking you love Katie more than she loves and respects you.

You can\u2019t have it both ways, sorry to tell you that.", "NTA.\n\nThe only person you will have to live with your whole life is yourself, so make choices that fit your own comforts and ideaologies.\n\nThe fact she won't acknowledge her fiance's wrongdoings after you told her is a red flag for me. \n\nMaybe you need to have a one-on-one with bsf and have an honest conversation about this. Explain why you are hesitant to be a part of this and if she ends up being dismissive or harsh, you'll know cutting your losses is best.", "NTA.  No matter what you do you have to be ready for your friendship to end unless you\u2019re willing to put up with the homophobic comments.  You said he thinks your after her, so he might be testing you to see how you react, cause if your gay but you act like they don\u2019t bother you he\u2019ll say it\u2019s because your not gay and you want your friend.   The worse thought is your friend don\u2019t address it because she believes the same way her fianc\u00e9e does and has kept it from you all your life pretty much.  Or she loves him so much she\u2019s ignoring a serious character flaw.  If you want to know where stand with her without saying anything, I don\u2019t know if you have a boyfriend or not so this might be hard if you do, if you have a +1 and you have a friend who is or can play the stereotype flamboyant and go to the wedding hand in hand.  DO NOT TRY AND UP STAGE THE COUPLE.  If you don\u2019t have a boyfriend introduce him and ask you the same thing she\u2019s asked you and get her opinion on him.  If have a boyfriend just be yourselves hold hands where groom see you all and just make small talk, be everybody\u2019s friend.  If you friend calls you out saying you brought a guy just to make the groom uncomfortable turn it around and ask why all of a sudden your being gay is an issue.

I think you need to have some conversations with her before you make that choice.\n\nFrom the comments the husband-to-be made citing the Bible, it sounds like he's a Christian and disagrees with the concept of gay marriage. You've voiced your concerns about this to your best friend and she's brushed them off. Is she also a Christian and/or doesn't support gay marriage but isn't as vocal about it? It'd be really shitty to try to scapegoat the husband-to-be for something your best friend also believes. \n\nA few other things. How does this guy treat your best friend? You've said he makes her happy. You're still relatively young but have they been together long enough that you have a good idea about who he is and how he treats her? Besides disagreeing on gay marriage and the initial period of being insecure with you hanging out with his girlfriend (I think that's pretty natural for any guy who has a girlfriend with a guy best friend, or vice versa), how has her husband-to-be treated you? Are you forbidden from hanging out with your best friend? Doesn't sound like it. Are you excluded from their lives? Doesn't sound like it, especially if he's OK with you being involved in the wedding. \n\nSo here's what you need to ask yourself - are you willing to throw out years of friendship because your best friend's husband doesn't support gay marriage? Friends and family disagree about things. Sometimes very significant things. It doesn't mean it's always worth it to cast those people out of your life (contrary to what Reddit users say).

This marriage, and the wedding has nothing to do with who OP is.  It's not about him.\n\nNo, it's not a punishment for OP for being gay.  The bride didn't invite him as a punishment for being gay, that's disingenuous.  Her marriage has nothing to do with OP,  she's choosing the man she loves (flaws and all) and asking her best friend to be a part of this important milestone for her.  THIS IS NOT ABOUT OP. I've been to weddings where one person wasn't an ally, nobody brought up my being gay as an issue at the wedding.  I think OP will live and survive supporting someone who asked him to be there. And while you're misusing Baldwin, she isn't disagreeing with OP's right to exist.  OP didn't ever actually say the groom said he shouldn't exist either.  \n\nI have a sister that once spelled out faggot during scrabble with my brother when we were 14.

That can't be done by treating everyone who doesn't agree with everything you do as an enemy or the people who love them as something to discard. \n\nYeah people are changing but it's often not healthy to put yourself in role of trying to change them.

In that mindset, it probably would have felt \u201cdramatic\u201d if he judged his friend\u2019s partner over some bad vibes.

Or better yet, stripping marriage of any legal recognition and forcing everyone to get a civil union, the government doesn't recognize my baptism, why should it recognize my marriage? \n\nMy problem isn't with gays getting to make legal decisions about each others health in a medical emergency or being assumed beneficiary of their finances upon death in the absence of a will. My issue is with the Government telling me you are entitled to a party and if a Christian Company doesn't cater to it for religious reasons they can be shut down or at the very least forced to go to the Supreme Court.\n\nI don't want a Theocracy, I want to not have to choose between my faith and livelihood, something which actually is enshrined as a Human Right.", "\\>OP says that both his friend and himself told the guy he was gay because he was getting jealous of them spending time together and thought OP was going after his fiance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMissed that. My bad then. Changing my judgement to NTA. fiance is clearly looking to get into an argument that OP is not interested in having. It's one thing to have your beliefs and have them slip out here and there. It's another to goad someone with directed comments that you know will bother them and OPs friend should have told her fiance to tone it down around OP whom he was making uncomfortable with his constant commentary.

I mean it\u2019s kind of a brilliant tactic. How do you make sure a woman won\u2019t reach out to her best friend? Well if he\u2019s gay make him wonder if you are also homophobic or condoning it. Because if you\u2019re Op what do you do! You can\u2019t harm yourself for a possibility that you\u2019re friend doesn\u2019t know.\n\nAnd if the relationship is healthy and fine then this woman clearly condones Homophobia which is so bad.

I'm a woman and I think it's dramatic as fuck, no matter the gender, sex, or sexual identity of the person doing it.  Nobody is saying that he should be forced to be in the wedding or can't bow out.

Just because some people use it to be hurtful to people like me does not mean the adage doesn't have value.  I prefer still, to treat people as *human* to spite their flaws, as I would expect to be treated as human despite mine. I've had more than enough fingers wagged from within my own family.

Think about it the op bails then his wife will probably be sad but he has the pleasure knowing he won and he not at the wedding anymore. In the situation the wedding is completely ruined then he just gets more justification for his beliefs and possibly everyone else involved in this wedding will be upset because the OP and he's truly vile then he'll probably use that to get sympathy and turns everyone involved against the OP.
