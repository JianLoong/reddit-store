{"id": 12664, "submission_id": "11vi866", "title": "AITA for uninviting my sister to our wedding?", "selftext": "Over the last 2-3 years the relationship between my sister (32 y.o) and myself (24 y.o) was just okay. This type of relationship exists in my opinion as we are just very different people at very different points in life, she has started a family (3 kids) and at the time I moved out and was still in university. Some character traits also made it harder to bond with her as she has gotten more negative and judgey towards my parents life choices and my life choices. I don\u2019t hold this against her though. \n\nAbout a year before our wedding my wife and I got engaged. Everyone in our friend and family circle including my sister were very happy for us, so much so my sister was literally balling her eyes out. A few weeks after the engagement we reached out to my sister to ask if my nephews (both under 5 years old) would want to be the flower boys as it would be a great experience for them and would be very cute! She was instantly excited and was all for them being in the wedding. \n\nThrough the year of planning the wedding my wife and I were not only stressing about the planning but I also started a new job and my wife was working part time and also completing her last year of University. It was a hectic year and our social life wasn\u2019t the strongest.\n\nNow fast forward to 2 weeks out from the wedding. My sister messages me and says she doesn\u2019t want her sons in the wedding anymore as she is uncomfortable due to our relationship not being very strong. This shocked me and my wife. I didn\u2019t think we were in a bad place to justify this call on her end. I responded trying to understand further to which she brought up more than just being uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t like some guests in attendance, didn\u2019t think my wife and I made enough of an effort in the last year (same can be said about her), and she sent a massive list nitpicking our lack of communication. This list was very detailed with dates and events to which she didn\u2019t feel valued by me. I felt this list and approach was very over the top and unneeded and in fact quite inaccurate on many levels as she was just as guilty for the lack of connection over the years. She said she would be more than open to coming to the wedding with her family but would only do so because I am purely her brother not because she wants to.\n\nThis approach and the timing of this message really agitated me and my wife as not only would this disrupt the wedding ceremony but also make the wedding super awkward and my wife would feel anxious at our wedding which is our special day. Due to this I made the call to uninvite her to the wedding with the justification that if she isn\u2019t comfortable and doesn\u2019t genuinely want to be there then she is no longer welcome. I ran this by my parents and they also supported my decision even though it was very hard decision as we have always tried to be very family oriented. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1679223218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vi866/aita_for_uninviting_my_sister_to_our_wedding/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did so much to accommodate her and she has thrown everything back at you. Anyone knows that two weeks before a wedding is far too late to start changing things.\n\nI can\u2019t help thinking you have a lucky escape. She has managed to make all made your planning about her - so imagine how she would try to make your day about her too? No one person at a wedding should cause bride and groom to get anxiety, you did the right thing.", "NTA your wedding - your guest list, you\u2019re supposed to feel happy and comfortable and not have to worry about her weird ass moody attitude.", "NTA\n\nI kind of get the impression it\u2019s as if she expected you to be at her beck and call 24/7 and if you have busy lives plus planning a wedding it\u2019s selfish of her to assume so\n\nI think you\u2019ve made a wise choice as if she won\u2019t tell you exactly what\u2019s going on then you can\u2019t fix any issues\n\nCongrats and have a great wedding!", "NTA - She blatantly told she doesn\u2018t want to come and would only do so because she feels obliged to. Then it\u2018s only fair to grant her that wish especially if it makes you and your wife also feel more comfortable.\nI also think it\u2018s a super shitty move to make that list and only bring it up two weeks before the wedding. She could have said that she didn\u2018t feel valued the moment she started the list and not write it down to use it as a gotcha moment down the line.", "Nta. Sounds like a narcissistic person and you gave her a lot more leeway", "NTA\n\nAs she said, she doesn't want to go.  There is no need to introduce any potential drama to your wedding.", "NTA", "NTA - she said she doesn\u2019t want to be there. Easy fix.\n\nWishing you a very happy wedding day and a wonderful marriage.", "NTA\n\nIt was her call ultimately by saying she didn't want to be there", "NTA You wouldn\u2019t want your sister to be *uncomfortable*, would you? She herself said she really didn\u2019t want to go. Sounds like the best thing to do was to uninvite her. \n\nOMFG, at least with this two weeks heads up, you may have saved yourself sone drama at your wedding. I hope it is very nice and as stress free as these events can be.", "Assuming what you said is complete and accurate, NTA. That said, while you may be in the right, your sister appears to be feeling emotionally hurt in some way, whether because of your actions or not. While it's tempting to respond negatively, and if you value your relationship with your sister, you should at least try to reach out and see what's going on. Remind her that you love her and certainly didnt mean to hurt her, but that it hurts you she doesn't want to be there (again, because you love her). Perhaps the wedding could be a starting point for bringing you two closer together. Maybe ask if you can just chat for a while at a lunch and really understand where this is coming from. While it's not guaranteed things will work out, if you approach the conversation with compassion things might turn around, and if not then at least you tried\n\n\nY'know... thinking about it now this may be best to put off until after the wedding. The wedding should be about you and your fiance, and this may be something you simply can't handle at the moment. But ultimately that's up to you", "NTA. I find it quite telling that your parents agreed with you.", "NTA. Your sister screams red flags. You have taken the right call. If she was legitimately concerned for you, she wouldn't wait for the last 14 days. \n\nHappy married life. Do give us an update later!", "There's not enough info here. You didn't list what her \"nitpicks\" were and why she didn't like the guests. It's one thing if you invited someone who bores her; it's another thing if you invited her historic abuser. So even if you don't take her issues seriously, we can't say with certainty that her issues aren't valid.", "NTA", "NTA. But wow. First time I've seen someone take Hamilton's advice: \" here's an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements\". \n\nYour sister really holds onto things and needs to work on her communication.", "NTA - she implied she didn\u2019t want to go to the wedding so she doesn\u2019t need to be there.  I think you made a good decision.", "NTA People grow up and change. Sometimes sibling end up with completely different lives and opinions. People get busy. If seeing sibling is so important, you\u2019re right, she could have reached out and told you she wants to see you and it\u2019s important because she doesn\u2019t want you two to become distant from each other. My sister has done this to me. Still does, in fact. But I\u2019ve learned she expects me to call her twice per week to keep her happy. So I do so to keep the peace. We are also very different people and once went two years without speaking. It started with a fight over her explosive and violent behavior though. \n\nTo be fair to her, she\u2019s had to struggle with serious mental health problems and has at least gotten the violence under control. She would make decisions about things suddenly similar to what your sister is doing to you. Like plans would be made, things would be paid for and suddenly \u201cyour niece won\u2019t be allowed to go because you aren\u2019t bothered to spend time with her on a regular basis\u201d while I was a single mom working 60-80 hrs per week just to survive. I literally couldn\u2019t spend as much time with my niece as I\u2019d like because I was working constantly and barely had time with my own my kids and this was time I was finally able to a lot for her. \n\nIt also sounds like she is putting the responsibility of your relationship with her on you and not taking any responsibility herself; similar to my sister. Considering you two aren\u2019t what you\u2019d call close, have you checked on her mental health lately? Maybe she\u2019s depressed and she\u2019s overreacting because her mental state is not good.", "NTA.  I went into this fully intending to call you the AH, figured you were overreacting.  But she herself just said she\u2019s coming to suffer through dealing with it.", "NTA\n\nLMAO She pulls that bs and thinks she's still invited? No way what an asshole.\n\nDATES? She documented the times she felt unvalued instead of bringing it up? Hoping you would read her mind?", "NTA. This is nothing but drama and stress that you do not need. You're 100% right, she shouldn't be at your wedding if she's so uncomfortable. \n\nYour sister wanted you to chase her and validate every little emotion she has as though everything is about her in your relationship. Whatever is going on in her life that's making her project all over you, she needs to find someone else to take it out on. \n\nIf she wants to apologize for drama mongering and tell you how much she wants to be there to celebrate your marriage, she can be invited again.", "Not enough information. What is she nitpicking? What did she not like about the guests? What list was so detailed? What was over the top and unneeded? Something must have stood out to you.\n\nI feel like OP is omitting crucial info.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If her presence there doesn't add to your day (and the awkwardness caused by her silly laundry list of her problems with your relationship sounds like it may actually detract from it), then she does not need a spot there.", "NTA - And you get major points for listening and then moving decisively instead of going round and round. Your sister either has emotional problems or financial ones that preclude her from attending. These don\u2019t have to be your problems. If she has chosen to exclude herself then so be it. Maybe she\u2019s looking for others to chase after her and jump through her emotional hoops, but no one has time for that.", "NTA\n\nPhone. Email. Mail. All work both ways. \n\nShe could have easily reaches out knowing how involved you are with a wedding, your own life that doesn't revolve around her.", "NTA", "NTA. I think your sister\u2019s husband is the driving force here.", "NTA. She told you she didn't want to come.", "Ofc NOT. She is the reason she\u2019s not invited anymore", "You're NTA. She chose to stir the pot two weeks before the wedding. She got what she deserved.", "NTA", "Agree", "Looks like the only thing your sister is catching is the bouquet of drama.", "I have reached out recently but she has ghosted me. I even congratulated her on some life milestones lately but still no response from her end.", "Yeah, something is missing here. It\u2019s weird the relationship can change so much in a year without something more significant happening in between. I think the relationship was more than \u2018just okay\u2019 to the sister if she was bawling her eyes out at OP\u2019s engagement. Or something is happening in OP\u2019s sister\u2019s life that he\u2019s not aware of.", "Refer to other comment.\n\nIn regards to the list.\n\nIt had dates of when we last called or chats we had that didn\u2019t lead to her expectations. It had conversations that she didn\u2019t agree with. It had the efforts she made that she didn\u2019t feel were reciprocated. That\u2019s as much as I can share without getting into it.", "Ahh I'm sorry to hear that, I'm sure that hurts. You approached the situation the best way you could, it's up to your sister to decide if she wants that relationship now. Best of luck", "My original post was over character count so I can clear some stuff up. \n\nThe switch on her end came when I didn\u2019t invite my brother in law\u2019s mother as she took this personal even though my wife and I have no relationship with her. My sister said well if you aren\u2019t close with her than I guess you aren\u2019t close with me. Which I disagree with as I have had more of relationship with my sister in comparison. \n\nThe person at the wedding she did not like went off at my brother in law at a family function years back due to his rudeness of not saying hello to guests. In fact when my sister messaged me she also made clear that my brother in law wouldn\u2019t be coming. Now from my perspective I have no issue with this guest as they have been very nice and helpful over the years to me and wife.", "Still not enough info. You said you were surprised in your original post that she retracted her sons\u2019 becoming the flower boys. Now you seem confident that the \u201cswitch\u201d, stated on your other comment, was after you did not invite her MIL to the wedding.\n\nSo, not to badger you or anything, but there\u2019s just something really off. So while I\u2019m leaning toward NTA, your story has too many holes.", "Fair enough, sounds like your sister is being very entitled when it comes to your wedding guest list. Totally NTA, as it\u2019s your wedding and she doesn\u2019t get a say about guests for her personal petty reasons.", "That is fair enough. What I mean by switching up is that she just wasn\u2019t reaching out at all or was being very short in communication after that. Upon reflecting that is when I felt that she started to not feel comfortable", "Ah that\u2019s understandable. I was a bit hesitant to go after your sister since everybody here already was anyway. But, yeah you\u2019re NTA.\n\nLooks like she just wants drama then"]}
