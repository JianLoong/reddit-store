It caused a lot of issues for her and all of us over the years and stopped her and I really having a relationship. She got therapy in her mid-20s and eventually got to the point of what she calls \u201caesthetic neutrality\u201d, which means she never comments on anyone\u2019s appearance and we are asked not comment on hers, positively or negatively (fair enough). \n\nShe enforces this with her 7 year old daughter \u201cZara\u201d as well. She asked from the time Zara was born that we never make comments relating to Zara\u2019s appearance, even if it was nice things. Everyone in the family normally follows this. \n\nA few days ago, we were all visiting my parents\u2019 country house for the weekend, and Zara and my 5 year old, \u201cAnya\u201d, were playing dress up. They came downstairs and my daughter ran over to me and my husband to show us the outfit and we said she looked beautiful in her dress. My husband took Anya to get a snack and Zara came over to me looking pretty dejected and asked if she looked pretty as well. Maybe it was just me being too soft but I couldn\u2019t look at her and not answer, given that she\u2019d asked me directly, so I said yes. Her face lit up and she left the room to get a snack as well. \n\nKate immediately rounded on me, telling me I was undermining her parenting and I know we\u2019re not supposed to make those kind of comments. She said disregarding her wishes as a mother was bad enough but lying to Zara is even worse and is going to set her up for failure in the future is she measures everything by appearances when she isn\u2019t good looking. I understand where Kate is coming from, I really do, and I said as much, but I just didn\u2019t have strength to say anything else when Zara was standing right there. Kate is now mad at me and saying she isn\u2019t sure she wants me babysitting until I can respect her choices on how to raise her kid.\n\nMy stepdad and mother are on my side, but my husband says I probably should have just redirected Zara to her mother given what Kate is like and I probably did mess up a little bit.

For two reasons:  \n1) It\u2019s exhausting following someone else\u2019s \u2018rules\u2019 for social interaction for over a decade, everyone makes mistakes or steps out of line occasionally. You can try your best, but frankly the whole \u201csocial niceties around appearance\u201d are everywhere and everyone does them, and occasionally you\u2019ll trip up on this one.   \n2) Your niece is being raised in a way that\u2019s HIGHLY likely to cause HER to have disordered self awareness. It\u2019s one thing to avoid forcing stereotypes and assumptions about appearance, it\u2019s another to openly say one thing to one child and not another in the moment. It\u2019s time you suggested that your SIL get some help with this, or talk to your sibling and ask them to help round the support wagons for help again.   \n\n\nTake this as a sign/message that your SIL is NOT over her issues, she\u2019s passing them on, and gently, kindly and lovingly work out how to help break this cycle with them.", "NTA and it\u2019s extra fucked she said that her own child isn\u2019t good looking.

I can't imagine how hurtful it would've been if you did give Zara a positive response.\n\nI can't help but wonder if it will be harmful in the long run for Zara to never receive positive reinforcement regarding her appearance. Let's be honest; how we present ourselves in society matters. If Zara doesn't receive any feedback that is body positive she may develop body image issues because her peers will receive this type of feedback  and Zara my question why she isn't worthy of being told shelooks pretty/nice/good. This is exactly the thing Kate is trying to prevent, but she may inadvertently cause it by being so extreme in her demands to never comment on Zara's appearance. Just a thought...", "NTA.

How could such a redirection to her mother look like? \"No comment.

It may be better to prepare her for lookism and teach her how to feel strong and confident apart from that. But that's certainly not my or your place to suggest - just a thought.", "NTA\n\nObviously there\u2019s the argument that you shouldn\u2019t parent someone else\u2019s children and your stepsister has obviously been dealing with her issues for a long time and, in her own way, is trying to prevent her daughter from having the same issues but she is clearly blind to the fact that her 7 year old child is becoming her own person, doesn\u2019t fully grasp the type of parent her mother is and what she\u2019s trying to teach her and when she sees how positively her cousin responds to a compliment, she\u2019s going to have that child-like reaction of \u201cwell, I\u2019m having some of that\u201d.\n\nYou had a human/mother/relative reaction to a child asking a question and looking for some positive feedback and you instinctively gave it to her, that\u2019s all.\n\nRelay to your stepsister that you understand what she\u2019s trying to accomplish in terms of how she parents her child and that while you may have overstepped you simply couldn\u2019t ignore what the child clearly needed.

The idea is that it sends a message to the child that \"looks\" are all that matter. Instead of \"wow, you are so smart\" or \"you are so hardworking, you should be proud\" \nBut a \"pretty\" compliment every now and then should be perfectly normal. Sometimes we as parents go TOO FAR. I think this is an example of that. \nWhat if that girl wonders why nobody tells her she's pretty? Then she spends her whole life believing that she isn't pretty. \nIt's a balance. I don't think you are the asshole here.", "NTA. \n\nIt is actually neither normal not \"neutral\" not to comment on appearance at all. What your sister does stems from her own issues which she shouldn't project onto her child. World focuses on appearance, that's just the matter of the factual reality. We're all visual creatures and enjoy beauty: of nature, art, and yes, also other human beings. So your sister is building that fake, albeit in her mind utopic, world for her child that is going to shield her from appearance-oriented comments - until she goes to school? Until she interacts with anyone from without her home? Until she actually goes outside?... So she is the one setting her daughter up for failure by creating that bubble instead of preparing her for handling these kinds of comments in a self-assured, souvereign way.\n\nOther thing is, your sister has mentioned your niece being \"not good-looking\". First, that's a comment on appearance, danger danger! But jokes aside: even if that's super-objective, realistic assessment of your niece's appearance, that's still a crass comment from her own mother. Again: projection, much? Additionally, your niece is probably a fairly normal-looking child, like 90% are. And some children have to grown into their looks. Even if that's the case (or even if your niece is exceptionally bad-looking, which I doubt), that does not mean that you lie, necessarily. Basically every child looks nice in nice clothes, being happy and all. So your sister better checks herself.\n\nBut I don't want to get too negative, so a couple of quick tips here as well:\n\n1) You can facilitate healthy personality development in children by commenting on their appearance in an activity-focused manner, i.e. \"You look so artistic when you dance!\", \"Your movement are so flowing, that's great to watch\" or something like that. \n\n2) You can comment on parts of their appearance that are connected to personality, for example \"Your smile makes the world light up\" or \"Wow, you sure like bright coulours. That looks good on you\".\n\n3) And yeah, you also can just say \"You look pretty\". As long as you don't overdo it, the child should turn out just a-okay.", "Nta - I was pretty as a little girl, and I'm still pretty now in my 30s. My mother never complimented my looks and would get mad at my father or other family members for doing so, saying I would become conceited. She was also critical in other ways which also affected me, but this in particular upset me. Instead of not being focused on looks I developed a need for validation from others whether about my looks or my worth (often based on my looks). It isn't/wasn't healthy. She could easily have tried to reaffirm my other positive qualities are more important (kindness, intelligence, creativity) but also complimented my appearance.", "Kate is the asshole.\n\nWhat kind of psychopath won't allow anyone to tell a little girl in a princess dress she's pretty because her idiot mother has a complex?\n\nNTA", "NTA Zara asked \u201cdo I look pretty\u201d when a child asks a question about themselves or their work/talents/skills it\u2019s called positive reinforcement. I am absolutely sure she did look pretty (therefore not a lie) but had they been dancing/drawing/singing you would also say good whatever to help build their confidence.", "Wait her mother described her as not attractive? \nJesus Christ - this little girl is going to be desperate for someone anyone to say she\u2019s beautiful. \n\nMy mother is beautiful- I am less so definitively less so. And I knew it.  And most of the time I do not care as personality wise I outshine my mother every day.  Something she loves to tell me. Along with how I shine bright like a diamond, that I have beautiful hair or skin. \n\nBeing told parts of you are beautiful even when not conventionally attractive is important.

What we need to teach kids is that they have beauty but that it needs to be balanced with the knowledge that beauty is subjective and temporary and there are more important things like character and kindness when we value ourselves and others. Another example of passing insecurities is my mother-in-law grew up poor and she was as hard up when she was parenting my husband, so she buys too much for my kids now that she is in a better place. My husband and I are in a good financial position so our kids do not lack for anything but my mother-in-law bought so much for her grandkids that I had to stop it because I felt my kids were getting spoiled and felt they did not have to care for things or value them because Grandma would just buy them another one if they lost or broke whatever thing, and I did not want my kids thinking getting a new snowboard/whatever expensive thing every year was a normal thing.", "The stepsis is going to give her daughter some serious issues", "I had the same kind of mom as Zara did.

They're funny, bright, loyal and have killer dance moves. I tell them how much it means to me when they use their manners, try new things, help younger kids or plant a surprise kiss on my cheek when they walk past me. \n\nThe world isn't going to stop valuing their beauty, and I don't need it to.

Just to prove how it didn\u2019t bother me.\n\n20 years later and I laugh about it now, but god damn it still stings. It took my boyfriend years of affirmation to make me feel good about my appearance and I finally have the confidence to wear conventionally feminine clothing.", "Zara doesn\u2019t look that much like Kate.\n\nI do think if Zara turns out pretty there will be issues. Kate was a nightmare to me for our teenage years because I was more conventionally attractive. She was awful to my mother for the same reason.", "Kate may not say it in front of her, but to be honest that doesn\u2019t really matter. Kids are tiny sponges who pick up on everything and Zara will be able to understand soon enough that her own mother considers her \u201cugly\u201d. \n\nFor the record, I\u2019m a psychologist and an expert in body image research. And what Kate is doing is\u2026 probably not going to have the intended effect.\n\nTo explain, I first need to say that body image consists of both how much we like/dislike our appearance (body satisfaction) and how much we base our self worth on appearance (appearance investment). Body dissatisfaction isn\u2019t inherently harmful - for example, I don\u2019t particularly like my appearance. I\u2019m scrawny but somehow also have a fat little pouch on my stomach and certain body parts are disproportionate to others. The thing is\u2026 I don\u2019t really care because I don\u2019t base my self worth on appearance (not anymore, at least). So since I have very low appearance investment, my body dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t bother me. But high appearance investment *is* very harmful and predisposes people to depression, social anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse, etc. \n\nWhat Kate\u2019s doing could inadvertently raise Zara\u2019s appearance investment. Zara will be able to tell that her mom reacts strongly to appearance-related statements and she may infer that appearance must be important to her mom. And since her mom never comments on her appearance (even though appearance is super important), Zara might start thinking there\u2019s something *really wrong* with her appearance. \n\nI get what Kate is trying to do. I really do. My own mother used to \u201cmoo\u201d and \u201coink\u201d when I opened the fridge and it took me *years* of specialization in body image research to undo that damage. But what works for adults doesn\u2019t always work for kids - especially when the kiddos don\u2019t have the same context we do. Kate knows that the world is a cruel, fucked-up place that values women based on appearance rather than achievement. She knows how harmful body image disturbance can be. But Zara does not. She won\u2019t understand why her mom gets *so upset* regarding appearance and she\u2019s likely going to think it\u2019s her fault - kids often blame themselves because they are \u201cegotistical\u201d in a psychological sense and believe their actions influence everything. \n\nAnyway\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. I don\u2019t think Kate is either. I think she\u2019s a woman who has struggled a lot  and she\u2019s trying do the best she can for her daughter. But she should probably speak to a child psychologist with body image expertise before she accidentally creates more issues. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Little kids have big ears.

Or even this...\n\nHow many times in your life have you left a room, and been able to hear the conversation in the room?

No one ever told me I was pretty, or looked nice, or even that I was cute. And that didn't lead to me not caring about my appearance. That made my appearance THAT much more important to me. \n\nFor SIX YEARS I wore make-up almost every day. Even though I am allergic to it. I dealt with the rashes and itching and the occasional swelling or hives for SIX YEARS because I was SO ashamed of how ugly I must be for no one to have ever told me I was pretty. Now, my face is riddled with scars and rough patches from those allergic reactions. \n\nI still deal with such severe body image issues that if anyone compliments me I assume they are lying. Because if no one calls you pretty, then you must be ugly. It is ABSOLUTELY 100% devastating and horrible for ones self worth and self confidence. \n\nAnd mind you- I was never told I was ugly. I was never told bad things about my appearance. But because no one said I was pretty... Even when complimenting other kids around me... My mind automatically determined it was because I wasn't, and everyone was just trying to be nice. \n\nPLEASE, show this to your step-sister.

For teenage girls, who are almost certainly already in the depths of insecurity (studies show that most girls start having issues with self-esteem as young as 9!), having the affirmation of your parents/guardians/family is INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. She is already going to suffer from feelings of inadequacy and self doubt without the help of her mother; Kate should be her daughter's safe harbor, not part of the storm.   \n\n\nI think, at her core, Kate's idea had SOME merit, in the sense that her daughter shouldn't have ONLY her looks commented on. She should receive praise and attention for being kind, for being funny, for being intelligent, or clever, etc. There are things more important than looks that should be acknowledged, and looks alone aren't the only thing that gives a person value.

If she outright comes up to someone and asks if she looks pretty in a princess dress, it is perfectly acceptable for someone to validate that desire.   \n\n\nAncedote here, but I have, unfortunately, seen firsthand how absolutely damaging a mother's feelings about her child's appearance can be. A friend of mine from middle school has a teenage daughter who is a little bit overweight. After a recent doctor's visit where that was discussed, my friend made a comment to her daughter akin to \"Don't you want to lose some weight? You'd be so pretty\". That crushed her daughter, and now she doesn't want to visit during my friend's custody time and isn't speaking to her. While I, as an adult, can rationalize that she didn't mean for her comment to come off the way it did, I can absolutely see how her daughter interpreted it, and how absolutely horrible that can be.   \n\n\nEven though most of us know that our mothers are biased towards their children, we still need the affirmation that someone who loves us very much considers us beautiful, no matter how we look. And again, it's not based purely on looks! Someone who isn't conventionally attractive can still be beautiful due to their personality, or their actions, and that is something that needs to be taught. Beauty is more than physical attributes. What Kate is doing is setting her daughter up for failure. The first time someone calls her beautiful OR ugly is going to ruin her life. She will then attach value to herself based on whether or not she is considered 'pretty' because that's how our society has trained us to think, and rather than Kate giving her daughter tools to develop her confidence removed from outside influences, she is setting her up to think ONLY of other's opinions, rather than her own.", "Oh jeezas, what a horrible thing to say to anyone, never mind your own kid.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry.", "We\u2019re not friends.

They said their rule was to never praise me. \n\nBut I saw other kids be congratulated or praised by their family growing up. I had teachers who told me I did well, only for me to brush it off and never accept I did do well in class. Because when I got home, it didn\u2019t matter what I did, there was no \u201cgood job\u201d.\n\nI always felt I wasn\u2019t doing enough or good enough. I suffered from bad anxiety, low self esteem, tended to over work myself in school and later as an adult. Became a perfectionist workaholic to punish myself. I became a huge people pleaser and neglected myself. Never felt worthy of anything for a long time.", "Im sorry, but she doesnt. She doesnt want her kid to be happy, at least in regards of appearance, if she did she wouldnt pull this \"no one can be nice to my kid\" schtick.\n\nShe has issues with her image and wants her kid to be just as miserable, maybe not consciously, but it's obvious", "My wife\u2019s parents love her too, but saying stuff like, \u201cfirst braces, what\u2019s next a boob job?\u201d To a middle schooler sticks with someone a lifetime. It only takes one comment.", "A child who never received a compliment will become an adult who is desperate to be complimented, and will create a whole bunch of issues (likely in the form of extreme people pleasing and unhealthy attachment).

My parents love me. They still gave me enough issues that I\u2019m going to be in therapy until I\u2019m 50. \n\nKate is taking it way too far. The fact that she even IMPLIED that her daughter is ugly is a big red flag to me. That is a five year old kid who wants to be a pretty princess- you damn well tell her she\u2019s a pretty princes. Kate is doing nothing but giving her kid issues from the get go.", "I love my mum to pieces, but years of \"you'd be prettier if you...\" comments definitely damaged me. It doesn't have to be a negative comment to hurt.", ">Well I\u2019m not sure because I\u2019m not there all the time but I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d do that. Why would she? Kate loves Zara and wants her to be happy, why would she insinuate negative things about her?\n\nShe literally got mad because you said yes.  I'd call that pretty negative.\n\nYou didn't even say she was pretty.  You just said yes when she asked.  Then she said you lied right in front of her child.  SHE called her kid ugly right in front of you all and nobody said anything?\n\nYou're NTA in this situation, but I kinda think ETA for going along with it.  Kids need positive affirmations to gain the confidence to develop their uniqueness.   Yes, even about their appearance.", "I'm so sorry you went through that, I'm sure you are beautiful inside and out. Hugs and love to you, my fellow body image warrior.", "Thank you.

I wonder how much you judged her looks.", "ESH except the kids.", "Yeah I think some people just fuck whatever they can get", "Fair comment, never thought of it like that", "Yep, because the mom said not to.

Thank you for the correction. I think you're wrong in not sticking up for Zara, though, and being very ignorant of the type of damage your step sister is doing.", "Exactly! My parents never said that to me growing up and because of that, for a long time, I would give attention to anybody that said I was. That included hooking up with somebody twice my age for my first time just because of what they said. And I don't have kids yet, but if I do I'll make sure to tell them that they are pretty/beautiful so that they won't do what I did.", "This is so important - I have saved this comment!\nI grew up in the opposite home environment, and my mother didn't even tell me I was beautiful on my wedding day.\n\nI tell my children they are beautiful/ pretty/ handsome/ gorgeous, because they are, but now I have even more reason to do so.", "Look at the meme about men\u2019s shirts.

That way, especially girls, don't fall for the first person to ever compliment them.", "Yes! This is also something that my parents have done for us and I do it for my friends too because in my country things like this can cause young girls to get manipulated and then 9/10 times leads to bad consequences.", "THIS.", "Your Mom is very wise! \u2764\ufe0f", "This so so much this. I have 2 girls. I tell my 4 yo every day she's pretty and cute because 1) my mom always made sure to crap on my appearance and it severely damaged my self esteem and I now equate me being fat as being ugly 2) I don't want it to be a shock to her and have her easily manipulated by anyone and 3) she's freaking cute. Her sister is 6 months old and gets a huge smile at being called cute. \n\nLow self esteem sucks so I'm raising my girls to know that they are beautiful, intelligent and can do anything they want but that some people are mean and hurtful and not good people to be around. \n\nOPs sister sounds like one of those people who aren't too good to be around.

I heard way too much as a child.", ">Lots of parents who love their kids fiercely still end up saying unkind things to them, because of their own hangups and insecurities.\n\nMy mom got a Disney Cast member to call me fluffy when I was 15.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah.", "I don\u2019t agree with that. I think Kate is trying to keep Zara from having the experiences that she did, not realising she is giving her a different potentially harmful experience. \n\nAnd I get that. I had my own issues relating to physical appearance. I would hate for my daughter to have the same anxiety about her looks as I had as a teenager. And every day I remind myself that she wasn\u2019t born with the context that I have, she\u2019s a fresh person. It\u2019s hard. And I\u2019m sure as she grows up it will keep being hard not being able to protect her from everything that hurt me, so I get what Kate is trying to do. I\u2019m just not sure it will work.\n\nBut again I\u2019m not trying to make Kate change, I just think it\u2019s harsh of her to accuse me of undermining her parenting over this one instance", "I saw a little girl out the other day - she had her cat ears on, was wearing bright patterns and was adorable. I told, her I loved her style and she lit up (also coming from a 46 year old woman with rainbow hair, rainbow glasses and big rainbow earrings even though I was dressed in workout clothes).  None of us can control our heights, our bone structure, our basic looks. But we can choose how to live in our bodies.", "I don't understand, you literally asked about the kid's look, she just responded to you so where is she being judgmental ?", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to get mad at OP just because someone asked her opinion on the looks of her niece and she answered", "How much I judged Kate\u2019s looks?

I was today years old when I realized I also craved words of affirmation, and why.", "Or even just an underage asshole.", "You are right it feels harsh. But her daughter gets so many more of these harsh moments and must live with a thief of joy and pride. You might think a bit too highly of your friend to see she is abusing her daughter. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t feel this was abusive you wouldn\u2019t feel so guilty.", "This interaction is so cute!! Thanks for brightening up my day \u2764\ufe0f", "I'm a 39 year old woman, and lemme tell you - nothin makes my day more than when I get compliments on my brightly dyed hair", "And again, why should anyone call her ugly? She's a kid! She'll change all they way thru her life and only then they'll know what she'll look like. Now she's just a kid, and they all look the same to me honestly,like normal kids. If she has a nice dress on, she's cute. \ud83d\ude02 No need for that seriousnes yet. Just tell her she's beautiful and move on,just like op did. Op is Nta. Zara's mom, however.....", "It\u2019s really sad.", "That is the worst part. I missed it on first scan. She thinks her kid is ugly.", "I'm crying right now because I just realized how much I crave words of affirmation. Growing up, I never got compliments from my mother, or really anyone for that matter. I mainly got yelled at for things I tried to control and couldn't. My hair was frizzy but I was never taught how to take care of it and there was no internet to show me. I had a lot of acne but I didn't know how to take care of my skin. I shut myself off from basically the world for years because I honestly thought I was the problem. Looking back, I realize how much just a simple \"You look nice\" would have helped me, I might not the affirmation and touch starved person I am today.", "Yeah words of affirmation are incredibly important to me. Like at work everybody got a card from management telling them like good job and such. They misplaced my card for a bit and I actually cried. But when they found it I posted it on my wall. Or we did a project back in high school where we had to ask people to describe us with one word and I put all the little slips on paper on a poster and have it on my wall that I look at every day.", "Well, I got the \"You'd be so beautiful if you lost weight\" most of the time... So yeah...\n\nI think this is true of any type of compliment though. I remember a \"pick-up advice\" thing about complimenting with the opposite of the girl's most obvious trait (I wanted to see the other team's play). Like tell the hottest girl she's really clever and smart, tell the nerdy chick she's beautiful. (Because obviously they can't be one and the same/s)", "My therapist believes that people's \"love language\" often reflects what they didn't get as a child. Like my husband got a lot of pretty words, but his parents didn't live up to them. So he prefers time and acts of service. Where I got zero positive words but lots of gifts, gifts mean very little to me, and I've made some bad choices for people who would say the words I needed.", "What set her up to have these issues was not the compliments she received, but rather the PRESSURE to perform and be beautiful from being put into modeling and pageants, only for people to turn on her and her looks when she hit puberty (sounds like the people around her were fuckin creeps imo). She definitely has trauma that explains a lot of this, but none of it is an excuse to pass those insecurities and issues down to her daughter and she needs to see that that's exactly what she's doing.", "But then \"you look smart\" is lying too. It's silly. \n\nThere's propping up your kid like a doll and shoving them into pageants, model, etc, and there's just being a loving mom. My kids will always be beautiful to me. If they landed face first into pavement and no longer looked traditionally appealing to the public, that would still be my beautiful baby.\n\nHer daughter is going to grow up believing she's ugly because of this treatment. Like there's a big secret of Zara being ugly but we don't want to tell her and hurt her feelings. She's going to notice these things don't get said to her. Even in the way nearly every single parent says it lovingly to their kids.", "Yeah, cause that would give the kid a message like \"nah, your ugly, but atleast you're smart\" bullshit", "That's because this treatment already is making Zara think she's ugly. She sees other people always being told they're beautiful or pretty and no one will say it to her. Kids aren't dumb, that's why she looked sad and asked you if she is pretty. She already thinks she isn't and was looking for validation.", "The problem in this particular situation was that you can't say \"you're pretty\" to just one kid when there are 2 present. It's not your fault, Kate should try to find some more flexible way of protecting Zara's self-esteem, but I guess a solution would be to not complement ANYONE's appearances when Zara is around.", "Same. \nAs soon as I was able to I went and got the affirmation I needed from all the wrong places, from whoever. Used and abused. Fast forward to now, I'm in therapy with a marriage on the rocks.\nJust tell your children they are beautiful/handsome because they ARE !!!", "Sweet PriorAlternative6, I am SOOOOO sorry the people in charge failed you that way. They likely grew up like my mom - she was probably never told she was pretty, either. And in many highly religious families, it's considered \"prideful\" to want to hear that you're pretty... so that figures in as well. Our parents figured if they told us that we were pretty, that we would become \"proud\". So instead, we just immediately gravitated toward those people who said what we wanted to hear.   \nYou are heard. You are not alone.", "I so completely get it. I'm trying to remember if my parents ever told me I was pretty... they told me I was smart, creative, talented, etc., but meantime, my heart wanted to just hear that I was pretty. Think I spent most of my life trying to be the good girl in order to obtain those words of affirmation. \n\nI always told my daughter, \"It is good to be pretty... but it is better to be kind.\" That said, I've told her she's beautiful SOOOO many times! If she was ever going to feel ugly it was NOT because her mama didn't tell her otherwise!", "That is the sweetest thing I've ever heard, and I'm stealing it.", "I know right? Zara's self-esteem will be in tatters when she figures out that her own mother doesn't think she is beautiful, when parents have parent goggles of unconditional love on. What will she think of herself?", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but the solution to Kate\u2019s philosophy is not to go against my own. If Kate wants to raise Zara in a certain way she needs to teach her not everyone grows up the same. I don\u2019t allow my daughter certain foods that Kate allows Zara but I don\u2019t expect her to forgo those when we\u2019re around. I just explain to my daughter that sometimes people do things differently."]}
