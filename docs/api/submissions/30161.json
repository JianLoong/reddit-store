It caused a lot of issues for her and all of us over the years and stopped her and I really having a relationship. She got therapy in her mid-20s and eventually got to the point of what she calls \u201caesthetic neutrality\u201d, which means she never comments on anyone\u2019s appearance and we are asked not comment on hers, positively or negatively (fair enough). \n\nShe enforces this with her 7 year old daughter \u201cZara\u201d as well. She asked from the time Zara was born that we never make comments relating to Zara\u2019s appearance, even if it was nice things. Everyone in the family normally follows this. \n\nA few days ago, we were all visiting my parents\u2019 country house for the weekend, and Zara and my 5 year old, \u201cAnya\u201d, were playing dress up. They came downstairs and my daughter ran over to me and my husband to show us the outfit and we said she looked beautiful in her dress. My husband took Anya to get a snack and Zara came over to me looking pretty dejected and asked if she looked pretty as well. Maybe it was just me being too soft but I couldn\u2019t look at her and not answer, given that she\u2019d asked me directly, so I said yes. Her face lit up and she left the room to get a snack as well. \n\nKate immediately rounded on me, telling me I was undermining her parenting and I know we\u2019re not supposed to make those kind of comments. She said disregarding her wishes as a mother was bad enough but lying to Zara is even worse and is going to set her up for failure in the future is she measures everything by appearances when she isn\u2019t good looking. I understand where Kate is coming from, I really do, and I said as much, but I just didn\u2019t have strength to say anything else when Zara was standing right there. Kate is now mad at me and saying she isn\u2019t sure she wants me babysitting until I can respect her choices on how to raise her kid.\n\nMy stepdad and mother are on my side, but my husband says I probably should have just redirected Zara to her mother given what Kate is like and I probably did mess up a little bit. Was I that wrong? Again, I do understand where Kate is coming from, but in the moment I don\u2019t think I handled it that terribly.", "created_utc": 1698923130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m1062/aita_for_telling_my_niece_she_looked_pretty/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You saw a five year old was upset about something and stopped her being upset about it.\n\nWhat worries me is this:\n\n> She said disregarding her wishes as a mother was bad enough but lying to Zara is even worse and is going to set her up for failure in the future is she measures everything by appearances when she isn\u2019t good looking.\n\nShe is not preventing Zara from conforming to women\u2019s worth = aesthetics, she is passing on her insecurities on to her daughter, which is going to be just as problematic down the line.\n\nShe straight up called her five-year-old ugly in front of her. This is not \u201caesthetic neutrality\u201d at all.", "NTA, but she sure is. How does she think it feels for her little girl to hear everyone else is pretty? She needs to bend that policy when her kid is with other kids being complimented.\n\nAnd she needs more therapy before she fucks her kid up. I hope she sees this.", "NTA. For two reasons:  \n1) It\u2019s exhausting following someone else\u2019s \u2018rules\u2019 for social interaction for over a decade, everyone makes mistakes or steps out of line occasionally. You can try your best, but frankly the whole \u201csocial niceties around appearance\u201d are everywhere and everyone does them, and occasionally you\u2019ll trip up on this one.   \n2) Your niece is being raised in a way that\u2019s HIGHLY likely to cause HER to have disordered self awareness. It\u2019s one thing to avoid forcing stereotypes and assumptions about appearance, it\u2019s another to openly say one thing to one child and not another in the moment. It\u2019s time you suggested that your SIL get some help with this, or talk to your sibling and ask them to help round the support wagons for help again.   \n\n\nTake this as a sign/message that your SIL is NOT over her issues, she\u2019s passing them on, and gently, kindly and lovingly work out how to help break this cycle with them.", "NTA and it\u2019s extra fucked she said that her own child isn\u2019t good looking. I understand aesthetic neutrality and do think it\u2019s valuable, but the moment she said \u201cshe\u2019s not good looking\u201d is the point at which she totally lost me. She could\u2019ve gently corrected your comment to something more neutral, like \u201cyes you look like a princess\u201d or \u201cyour outfit is so cool\u201d but instead she called an insecure kid ugly. Yeah, great parenting right there.", ">She asked from the time Zara was born that we never make comments relating to Zara\u2019s appearance, even if it was nice things. Everyone in the family normally follows this.\n\ni feel bad for Zara. and everyone in the family is definitely the AH for \"following\" such a harmful decision.", "NTA. I\u2019m no psychiatrist, but sounds like your niece is well on her way to her own complexes if this manner of parenting continues. Incredibly selfish of the mother to suck her kid into her anxieties.", "Totally NTA. I can't imagine how hurtful it would've been if you did give Zara a positive response.\n\nI can't help but wonder if it will be harmful in the long run for Zara to never receive positive reinforcement regarding her appearance. Let's be honest; how we present ourselves in society matters. If Zara doesn't receive any feedback that is body positive she may develop body image issues because her peers will receive this type of feedback  and Zara my question why she isn't worthy of being told shelooks pretty/nice/good. This is exactly the thing Kate is trying to prevent, but she may inadvertently cause it by being so extreme in her demands to never comment on Zara's appearance. Just a thought...", "NTA. What is society coming to? Aye, people are too sensitive to even have a compliment? I just can\u2019t even with this.", "NTA, it was a spur of the moment. Things happen. \n\nI don't agree with the mother's parenting decision completely though. the real world does comment on appearances negatively and positively. Clearly the daughter does understand the concept of looking pretty. I wonder why withhold such positive affirmations in this area. I agree that it is very important to teach children not to attatch self-worth to looks, but this is a bit too extreme.", "NTA for answering that girls direct question. And as long as you don't repeat it actively\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I honestly would have done the same\n\nI understand her approach, but I really don't know what you could have done differently. How could such a redirection to her mother look like? \"No comment. Ask your mother.\" That would be very hurtful for that girl, I believe. \n\nAnd tbh: Other people will comment on her appearance as they may not know about her mother parenting style. It may be better to prepare her for lookism and teach her how to feel strong and confident apart from that. But that's certainly not my or your place to suggest - just a thought.", "NTA\n\nObviously there\u2019s the argument that you shouldn\u2019t parent someone else\u2019s children and your stepsister has obviously been dealing with her issues for a long time and, in her own way, is trying to prevent her daughter from having the same issues but she is clearly blind to the fact that her 7 year old child is becoming her own person, doesn\u2019t fully grasp the type of parent her mother is and what she\u2019s trying to teach her and when she sees how positively her cousin responds to a compliment, she\u2019s going to have that child-like reaction of \u201cwell, I\u2019m having some of that\u201d.\n\nYou had a human/mother/relative reaction to a child asking a question and looking for some positive feedback and you instinctively gave it to her, that\u2019s all.\n\nRelay to your stepsister that you understand what she\u2019s trying to accomplish in terms of how she parents her child and that while you may have overstepped you simply couldn\u2019t ignore what the child clearly needed. She\u2019s 7, she\u2019s going to have a lifetime of struggles and will one day, maybe, appreciate the lessons her mother has tried to teach her but perhaps sometimes she could give her own child a boost on the odd occasion that she needs it.", "NTA. \n\nListen, I don't care if a child is ugly or cute as per my own personal biased opinions or those of others...(same as for babies; they'll always are cute even if pruny red-faced) \n\n\nIf a child has done an effort on outfit, be it disguise/costume or real one, I'll compliment them. \nI will also compliment them if they do an effort in other aspects.\n\n\nThere's a fine line between being realistic in your praise and giving tactlees truths, but not if any of them mean crashing childs sparks. \n\n\nThe difficult conversations on physical appearance, non physical qualities, and how to appreciate both in people without being blinded by aesthetic will be had, but not when a child just wants some praise to feel better.", "NTA\n\nDamn, that child is gonna have some serious issues in the future with a mom like that...", "NTA, she's a child and wanted to know if she looked pretty. Lord, I'd hate to hear what your sister would answer when she asked. She's going to do more harm than good with that attitude I'm afraid. You did nothing wrong. Your niece asked a question, you answered. You've done nothing wrong but your sis has a lot of problems.", "Lying to zara?! Does she think her own child is ugly?!
