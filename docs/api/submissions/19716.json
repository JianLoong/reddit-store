He gets really sweaty and honestly smelly and I do a lot to try and help him out but sometimes I feel like his mother and not his girlfriend. \n\nWhen he began his training, it started to become increasingly difficult for me to get intimate with him due to the sheer smell of his lower half. I love him so much but Im seriously losing any sexual attraction towards him. \n\nI started to make small comments regarding the odor and I could tell he was beginning to get annoyed at our lack of intimacy. One particular night, I told him \"You seriously have to shower more.\" and he took it very personally. He told me to bathe with him right then and wanted to get intimate right after. We got into the shower and I cleaned his body and then he requested that I clean his penis. Typically, I just help him get in and out of the shower but this time was the first that I had to physically do the scrubbing. He told me to get in between the foreskin and I began to gag when I saw what was inside. I found that smegma had began to collect inside and was absolutely disgusted. I try hard to be considerate of his situation but being that I was already annoyed about him bossing me around I told him \"Your feet even smell better than your penis!\" We have not been the same since. He barely speaks to me and actively avoids me. He is obviously very hurt from what I said and is not accepting any apologies.

Especially if you're disabled. He's a paraplegic athlete so that mean his upper body is still working right? So he can actually clean himself, if he is an athlete his upper body should be strong enough to do it. This sounds a bit weird. He should be cleaning himself daily.", "Nta. He could at least give himself a bath with a rag and a bucket. I was bed bound after a car wreck not that hard.  You don't owe him sex and if he wants fun times he has to recognize hat his hygiene can affect your help aswell", "NTA. \n\nSometimes people need to hear the worst about themselves. Your BF is obviously upset about it, and you may have been way too harsh, but it's the truth. \n\nIt might be time for a sit down discussion. If he can't get in and out of the shower on his own, it might be time to (if possible) convert the shower into a more accessible one, or looking into someone who's job it is to help him. \n\nIf neither of those options are viable for him, the next step is to get a chair in the bathroom where he can sit and sponge bathe himself daily (or multiple times a day) in between 2-3 regular showers a week. \n\nI understand living with someone who stinks - thankfully I wasn't in a relationship with them so I just moved when the lease ended. I wish you good luck!", "if he can move his hands then he should be able to clean his dick NTA that is disgusting and he SHOULD be embarrassed", "Nta gross", "Yikes I gaged just by reading it.\n\nNTA", "OP you and your bf need to speak with a caseworker (I would believe that he has one since he has to be on disability) or someone associated with his athletic association, and you need to find an outside trained home health aide caregiver that comes in and paid by Medicaid / Medicare to do such activities such as this.  It's unimaginable that he's not been bathing himself without any type of outside assistance, because that's part of what he's eligible for due to his medical situation.  It's admirable that you're trying to help him out, but it's putting too much of a strain on your relationship and remove this hurdle.  He also needs to take some responsibility too and not expect you to take care of it.", "I am a CNA. I understand 100% what you are talking about. \n\nYour boyfriend needs an occupational therapist like, yesterday. If he is fit enough to be an athlete, he is fit enough to learn how to clean himself. \n\nYou can\u2019t imagine the number of time I have said to patients that if they can eat by themselves and use the bathroom by themselves, they can clean their own private parts.\n\nNTA. \n\nIt would be a dealbreaker for me if he doesn\u2019t try to help himself.", "Yikes", "NTA But.. My stepfather was quadriplegic. He was injured when he was in his 20s and I met him later in his life. He had become a counselor at the hospital he did his rehab at. Many of the younger guys are really gong through some shit after they're injuries. I don't pretend to know anything about his situation, so excuse me if this isn't applicable. There's a lot of ego involved, and depression. I'd look at him not cleaning himself as a bigger issue than hygiene. Some people issue that manifest themselves in ways that even they can't understand our put into words. Or possibly he actually needs physical help that he's to proud to ask for. It sounds like you need to be able to have an honest conversation about these things, and it will probably take more than one. Not knowing your exact circumstance I can't give advice, but I would say approach with caution. And be aware it's almost certainly more nuanced than he doesn't care if he stinks. He could already feel inadequate and is doing it so he doesn't have to address that emotion. Possibly being dirty will help him avoid a situation that's uncomfortable for him, even if it's subconscious.", "NTA I would be out of that relationship so quick", "NTA.\n\nTbh why are you even apologizing? That\u2019s fucked, no excuses.\n\nIt seems like maybe a good time to just reassess if it\u2019s really working out if he\u2019s turning you into his nurse.", "he really sounds like he\u2019s using weaponized incompetence and idk how you expect to live like this forever. \ndo you want that lifev", "NTA. Are you able to get him an aid or someone who can help with daily tasks such as this so the full burden isn\u2019t on you?", "NTA he certainly does have the ability to clean himself up. Fill a bowl with water, use soap, it's called a 'whore bath' and his arms work, right? \n\nSince he's been neglecting himself and sweating, he probably has crotch rot. Look into it to see if he does. It's awful smelling and needs jock itch cream. That with the smegma, anyone could probably smell him from a mile away. \n\nThe things you've seen and done has changed the relationship. You shouldn't be doing stuff like this, it's a nurses place. How can you be attracted to something like this? No one can blame you for being repulsed. Honestly, who cares that his feelings are hurt about you pointing out the obvious, it's not like he's unaware of the stench. The stench is offensive and something he could find a way to solve without letting it get so bad. It's rude that he told you to wash him after you told him how bad he stinks. It was like he was punishing you for bringing up a major flaw. Now using the silent treatment to make you feel worse. Very manipulative boyfriend. You need to put up boundaries, tell him no to stuff like this. He's taking advantage of your kindness.", "You didn\u2019t provide your ages or how recently your bf was injured. Assuming he was an adult when this happened; and assuming he understands that high performance athletes need to pay strict attention to hygiene for a myriad of reasons, I\u2019m going with NTA. And I don\u2019t know how you can un-see or un-feel this experience. Your relationship might have just taken an unsurvivable hit. Good luck.", "I'm guessing he's missing his/mobility in his hands/arms since he couldn't scrub it himself? Is it possible to hire a person to come over and clean him regularly?", "[deleted]", "I remember the first time I saw the word \"smegma\". Ah, memories...\n\nHonestly, do you want the answer to who's the asshole in this one case, or to fix things up, communicate better, etc? Look up some basic couples therapy communication techniques, use I statements, all that stuff.\n\nAssuming you want to stay with him, or he with you.\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he can eat by himself several times a day, he can clean himself once a day as well.", "Going to go with a ESH weighted towards the BF. He needs to look after himself as much as possible but there's an aspect of the relationship dynamic that he was oblivious too (obvious yes but probably not from his perspective). I'd say he's more embarrassed than anything else, probably at the specific circumstances of the realisation. Open and outcome focused constructive chat is going to go a long way here, best disassociated with intimacy.", "I can't agree with that as it can have effects on her health.  The problem is that sex is expected but his lack of hygiene increases her risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder infections or yeast infections", "True, I was mostly going on the title and how the situation of the smell is handled, but being expected to have sex is not ok and OP is certainly NTA for not wanting to have sex."]}
