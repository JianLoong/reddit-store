I just pick the stuff off. She's made faces over me doing this in the past and I suggested calling  or texting me before she orders something or picks it up so I can tell them what to leave off. She did that like once and then stopped because either I was still at work and not picking up or she was tired and forgot. \n\nToday she wanted to eat an early lunch together and wasn't feeling the leftovers we both packed so we met up and she got hoagies for us. While we were eating, I was picking off the extras while talking to her. She made this annoyed face again and told me to stop pouting and just eat it as she got it. I asked her if I was making faces about it and she said no but picking stuff off was pretty much the equivalent of pouting and silently complaining.\n\nI was always taught it was fine to just take things off food but this seems to be a real issue for her so I'm here to ask if I'm in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1692204112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15suzxh/aita_for_picking_apart_food_my_girlfriend_brings/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hell no.  the GF needs to respect OP's taste buds.  If she's picking up food or making hoagies, she needs to **ask** OP what he wants.  And then get him what he wants, not what *she* wants.  Then, he wouldn't have to pick things off the food.", "\"she said no but picking stuff off was pretty much the equivalent of pouting and silently complaining.\"\n\nNo, pouting and complaining is the equivalent of pouting and complaining.  You appreciated the meal, but didn't want certain toppings.  Nothing wrong with what you did.   I pick off any raw tomatoes from my food (salad, sandwiches, etc), and my partner does the same with raw onions.  No reason to call each other out on it.  You like what you like. NTA\n\nAlso, coconut cake takes FOREVER to get all of the coconut off.  Like, an hour or something.  :-)", "NTA, she sounds like one of them people (my dad is one of them) that if she likes something everyone should. If they don't they should learn to like it. Food should be enjoyable. If there's things on or in the food you just don't like, why be forced to eat it? You're doing more than I would. I don't pick things off my food, I order it how I want it. If my husband orders, he knows what I like and orders my food how I like it. NTA, but she sure is.", "NTA.  I don't like pickles on my sandwiches, my hubby does.  So I pick the pickles off and give them to him.  He knows I don't like them and usually remembers to request them off. When he forgets, it's no big deal.  She is not being considerate of your wants by expecting you to eat what you don't like.  Why is she deliberately leaving those things on there? That is a better question.", "She is 100% purposely getting stuff she knows you don't like because she wants to try to train you into not disliking it anymore. \n\nShe doesn't take your preferences remotely seriously. That's not cool. \n\nYou need to have a serious talk with her. If she can't respect what you do and don't eat, she doesn't respect you as a person. Can you really have a healthy relationship with someone who doesn't respect you or your wants/needs?\n\nNTA, but your girlfriend totally is.", "NTA, if she doesn't want to see you pick things off she should remember the common bits you don't eat. Why would you force yourself to eat food that you don't like when you can enjoy it more by removing the part that is unfavourable to you.", "NTA. She continually buys you food that she\u2019s knows you don\u2019t like. STA. She expects you to just eat food that you don\u2019t like. What an asshole.", "NTA. She knows your preferences and actively does nothing but makes an issue when you quietly remove them. You even provided a possible solution to her issue. She's the AH here. She can either drop it, or stop getting you the things she knows you don't eat.", "NTA, but your girlfriend is a huge AH. She's deliberately buying you food she KNOWS you dislike and getting pissy about your failure to choke it down and act grateful. This is 100% a fucked up power play, not \"just\" laziness and a lack of consideration for you.", "Why isn't she buying you food that you like? It's really strange. She's the one that is sulking and pouting, not you.  NTA.", "Nta. My god she will lose her mind with a child.", "???\n\nI've gotten way more adventurous but I still don't care for a lot of really basic toppings like pickles or tomato or even, yes, bacon. So if I get a thing with those on it and I'm eating with someone who likes them, I donate them. Easy solution. Use a fork if she doesn't want the germs, right? I don't get people. NTA", "NTA, there are certain things I *cannot* eat unless I want to feel like my stomach is being painfully churned around, some people, remember some don't. your gf needs to respect what you can and can't eat. this would honestly be a deal breaker for me. she clearly doesn't respect or care about your food needs, what about other things in life, if you see a future with her? I know that's a stretch, but after lurking in this sub for so long, you need to seriously think: if your partner gets so offend by this simple request, what else will be *so offensive* to them?", "NTA  I was in a 15-year relationship and knew exactly how my partner liked their food from each place we regularly went and their overall likes/dislikes for food. They could not even remember that I hated mayo in or on anything. I made it a priority to know because it was important to me and clearly it was not to them. My current partner has notes in their phone for my preferred coffee from different coffee places, my fave foods, and any modifications for them across restaurants. (I found out because he surprised me with my fave drink from  an out of town place we hadn't been to in 3 years). Your gf is not making your wants and needs a priority because she can't be bothered. Do you feel like you deserve better than that? I hope you do. You need to have a talk with her and ask her why that is.", "NTA but maybe stop getting food for each other? She clearly doesn't give a shit that you're wasting food and money.", "NTA.", "NTA  -my SO, and I usually know what the other likes and order accordingly, but if we forget or whatever,  we pick things off. In fact, I go ahead and get tomatoes in my stuff, even though I don't like them, and give them to him, so he has extra. \n\nI don't understand why she can't take the time to say no peppers on yours if that's something you don't like? I also don't understand why she can't remember that you don't like certain foods.", "NTA, if she doesn't want you picking shit off than shit shouldn't be there in the first place. Start buying her food with things she doesn't like on it.", "NTA, she knows you don't eat those things on your sandwiches. Look at it this way, what if you were allergic to one or more than one of the extra ingredients. Would she still get the sandwich for you the same way and expect you to eat it even though would have a reaction to it?", "Lol what?\n\nSeems like some serious lack of communication going on here. Either tell her to straight up stop buying your meals, or to use basic common sense and not order things that she knows you don't like.\n\nIf it happened more than once I think I'd start taking it personal. Like are you actually just fucking with me now?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou get to choose what you eat, no further justification is needed.\n\nIn my experience it's not hard to accommodate my partner's eating preferences. I know things she doesn't like and have them removed when ordering and plan what I cook around them, or have her involved with the ordering process like you mentioned.\n\nI grew up in a family that we had to eat what we are given and when I met my girlfriend I learned that I'm allowed to not eat things I don't like. Maybe talk with her about how ordering without certain things is a valid option and why you don't like eating certain things (again you don't need to justify eating things the way you like)?\n\nWish you the best", "NTA\n\nif she isn\u2019t gonna remember how you like your food, she can\u2019t me mad when you adjust it to your tastes.\n\nI\u2019m sure the Reddit police will get me for this one, but I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge deal to expect your partner to remember this shit. My partner isn\u2019t a picky eater, but I have his common take out orders all saved on my phone to make sure I get what he will like. He does the same for me. It\u2019s part of being in a relationship and being thoughtful", "NTA \n\n\u2026.why is she this selfish? My husband has known my subway order since we were together a few months and vice versa\u2026.he and I know what the other likes on their pizza etc and consider this when ordering \n\nShe doesn\u2019t even ask? That\u2019s\u2026.weird", "NTA - you're the one eating it so why does she even care? And why when she picks up stuff not even get you what you want instead of two of what she likes? This whole situation seems bizarre to me.", "NTA \n\nPetty me would find out what she does not like and serve her that and tell her to eat it as it is", "NTA. Is she offended if you add salt or spice to something she's cooked? Or pick around raw onions?", "NTA. \n\nAt this point in your life, you are old enough to know your tastes buds. You don\u2019t like certain flavours, no one can force you into eating them. Your GF needs to respect your tastes. You are entitled to eat the foods you like.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of uncooked onions, they get picked out of salads and burgers. They\u2019re too strong a flavour.", "Well she\u2019s the one refusing to listen to what you like and don\u2019t.
