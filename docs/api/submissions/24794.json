I'm nearing 30 btw.", "thank you! if my SO was constantly bringing me food loaded with stuff they know i don't like i would have my eyebrow raised to begin with -  \nbut then to give me shit about removing or eating around those items??? tf.  \n  \nidk if this is a weird power play or revenge or what but i barely had the patience to hear about someone else putting up w it.  \n  \nunless OP and their partner are 9yr olds none of this makes any fuxking sense to me", "This was my first thought.

It\u2019s a texture thing for me - I can\u2019t choke down things that I experience as slimy.  Mushrooms on a pizza aren\u2019t slimy to me because it blends into everything, plus the oven dries them out.  I tried to explain this, but they were still mad.  I can only guess they were embarrassed for some reason?  I didn\u2019t complain, I just skipped the mushrooms.", "NTA\nIt is not pouting to remove toppings you don't like instead of eating them..

She knows you don\u2019t like certain things, she knows you pick it off when there are things you don\u2019t like, she should have some basics down as to what you won\u2019t eat, so why does she keep pushing your boundaries?", "NTA.. I have a bf who also picks off ingredients he doesn't like.. if I can prevent this, I generally call or text him in advance because I want him to enjoy his food! If he does end up picking off stuff, I make a mental note of it and ensure to omit that for his order next time. Does your gf like all foods??

When I get something to eat for my wife, I try and get the things I know she'll want, instead of getting whatever and letting her not eat it. It's either a very weird way to try and get you to do something you don't want to do, or a very very thoughtless way to get you food. Either way, if she's annoyed that you're not eating the food she doesn't give a shit about ordering for you, the easy thing to do would be to have some consideration for you and order something you'll eat without having to pick over it first.", "NTA.

Your GF is an inconsiderate jerk, though.", "NTA, but this whole situation is just mind-bendingly weird to me. If someone offers to pick up takeout for someone else, they ASK what that person wants!

I regularly stop and get a hot bar plate with three meats at the local Chinese restaurant.  The weird part?  I get two sweet and sour chicken without the sauce and one black pepper chicken.  I don\u2019t like the chicken in the black pepper chicken dish.  I won\u2019t eat cooked peppers either.  But I do like the sauce after the peppers have simmered in it and prefer that as my dipping sauce for the other chicken.", "NTA. You should eat what you want.\n\nThis issue is not about your being a picky eater. For me, it's one of communication. If you request that your girlfriend call or text you before ordering some food, then it's your responsibility to respond. You can't claim you're too busy. A quick text would take less than 2 minutes. As you have seen, when you ignore her efforts, there is no incentive to continue to try to reach out to you.\n\nAs for the girlfriend thinking you taking items off  your food is a sign of complaining -- communication, again. Reassure her (if you haven't done so) in no uncertain terms that your taking items off your dish has no reflection on her. If she continues to read more into this situation that is there, that would be for her to resolve within herself.", "Or she could order it without the items she knows you don\u2019t like", "NTA\n\nWhy does she keep ordering stuff that she knows you don't eat? That's a passive-aggressive move right there.", "NTA. I'm the pickiest person on the planet and my husband eats everything!! He always makes sure my food is to my liking because he knows I'm picky. He may tease me every once in a while but he never shames me for it. He's even strained his homemade spaghetti sauce when serving me because he knows I don't like the texture of cooked veggies. It takes very little effort to show someone you care.", "NTA. it's just rude and inconsiderate to continually order food for someone with ingredients you KNOW they don't like. Adults are allowed to not like certain foods, too.", "NTA but she may be tired of a partner who has a long list of \u201ceww gross\u201d foods like they are a child.  Just how long is the list of foods you don\u2019t eat?", "That's a weird way to control people. NTA. You sound like your respectful. You don't make a fuss.

It\u2019s was a discovery that once again, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t like a thing, I didn\u2019t like a \\*poorly prepared\\* thing! Same for sun dried tomatoes, which in the USA are just rubbery dehydrated tomatoes. Actual sun dried tomatoes or slow roasted drytomatoes are a different thing altogether.\n\nAlso, FOH with pepperocini or pickled peppers or picked jalape\u00f1os. Just NOPE. Mayo and sour cream and yellow mustard can die in a fire.

People who care about each other try to ensure the other one enjoys what they eat.  My partner hates capsicum and olives: one of my favourite pasta dishes is mostly those two things, so I make it on days when I know we have leftovers he likes.

Your girlfriend is very insecure and very controlling.  She will get worse and worse if you get married and she has you in chains.\n\nGet a good book on controlling personalities.  You have to put your foot down and tell her bluntly shen yiu zre alone snd NOT eating.  Tell her in simple Anglo Saxon English that you have had of her being a food Nazi, and if she refuses to buy you what you want to eat, you will buy your own food and she can buy hers.  \n\nBe preoared for an emotional reaction, and stand your ground, or she will go after whatever weak spot she sees to get you to back down.  Also, be prepared for her to get bossy and controlling about some other aspect of your life.  In the long run, at least in my sad experience, the solutions are two - therapy for her, which might not help, or breaking up with her.\n\nGood luck.", "Why does she keep buying food with things that she repeatedly sees you picking off?

It's rude of her to buy you food that she knows you don't like. She is being lazy by ordering two of the same, instead of something she wants and something you want.", "You are definitely NTA for removing the items you dislike. Food is meant to be enjoyed. She buys what she enjoys and gets to eat it that way. You have different preferences and that's perfectly okay. My partner and I over the years have learned and know each other's preferences.

I have a sneaking suspicion by the way you describe her reactions it's not so innocent though.\n\nDo each other a solid. Communicate that your food preferences are a reflection of you and not a 'between the lines' opinion of her. \"Hey I really don't like tomatoes. The texture is off putting to me. I don't want you to think that I think badly of you because we don't share a love of tomatoes. I just don't like them myself.\" Then you guys each make a list of stuff you 100% don't like and keep that in your phones. It won't be perfect because your immediate desires can change (you like cucumbers but don't want them on this particular sandwich) but it's a starting point so you're not picking off stuff you have always hated. \n\nIf she can't make this accommodation and/or gets angry about a reasonable conversation about your preferences it's a sign she doesn't respect you or your preferences.
