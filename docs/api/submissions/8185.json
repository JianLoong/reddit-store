Of course you are, but you know that? Right?\n\nWho\u2019s fault is if that she doesn\u2019t have long enough skirts? Yours! You know she is tall, of course the skirts will be shorter on her, as her parent it\u2019s your responsibility to get her clothes that fit the dress code. \n\nI also this the whole dress code thing is stupid. Her outfit being distracting?? Djises, I\u2019m so glad I never had to deal with stuff like that growing up.", "YTA. You literally admit you see nothing wrong with Kandi's outfit. She's already being punished for breaking the rules by the school, no need to pile on extra consequences for a first-time, potentially unintentional offense.", "**YTA**\n\nAnd as both a former educator and someone close to your age, I'm appalled that you GROUNDED her as though she had actively sought to do anything wrong. She didn't shorten the hem on her skirt or otherwise mess with it to be out of dress code; she just existed as a tall kid. Being sent home was more than punishment enough. Furthermore, I assume that she was only wearing the school clothes that you or your spouse bought for her. Most schoolchildren do not buy their own clothing. Which brings us to the other reason why it's utterly inane that you would be grounding her:\n\nYou say in the comments that \"she's getting older now and dressing herself is her responsibility\". Yes, GETTING DRESSED in the morning is a child or teenager's responsibility. But PROVIDING APPROPRIATE SCHOOL CLOTHES is not only your moral and ethical responsibility as a parent, it's also your legal responsibility. It is not your minor daughter's responsibility to provide school-appropriate clothes for herself. That's literally your job as a parent, and I'm sure that it's what the school expects as well. \n\nYTA because while minor children are responsible for their behaviour, they are absolutely NOT responsible for their own well-being or basic needs, and therefore she was not responsible for the fact that the only clothes she had to wear to school were not dress-code compliant. YOU are responsible for that. You owe her an apology and some new clothes, and a note to the school explaining that this was not her fault, and that you are sorry for the misunderstanding and hope that it will not be noted in her record, and that she will be provided with appropriate clothes going forward.", "YTA. You didn't seem to have a problem with how she dressed until the principal said something, then you sided with a sexist dress code that blames girls for distracting boys instead of blaming boys for not having the sense to stop ogling girls. All these dress codes do is reinforce to everyone that girls are to blame for the bad behavior of boys.", "YTA. As a fellow tall girl, she can't help being tall. You're punishing her and the school is punishing her, just for being who she is. It's gonna teach her that her body is a problem. I'm pissed for your daughter.", "YTA. Your daughter is right- dress codes like this often are harsher on anyone who isn\u2019t \u201caverage\u201d size. On top of that, the \u201cdistracting\u201d comment is a HUGE red flag, as it\u2019s often used as a way to shame girls instead of forcing boys to act with respect. \n\nYour daughter\u2019s crime was\u2026 existing as a tall girl and following the rules she\u2019s used to. You majorly overreacted.", "YTA \n\nSchool dresscodes are usually bullshit and punish girls for daring to have bodies.\n\nYou just enforced their sexist nonsense", "From a 5\u201910\u201d girl who had the same issues growing up. \n\nYou\u2019re the asshole.

Now your daughter knows by heart that she can\u2019t trust her own father, because he cares more about his own feelings and his mind is polluted by sexist trash", "YTA\n\nI'm assuming you bought the skirt and told her she had to wear it. So this was your failing.\n\nThat aside, you should be sticking up for your daughter at school. If anyone is distracted because they see her knees, the problem lies with them NOT your daughter. The solution lies with them NOT your daughter.\n\nDo better by your daughter", "YTA", "YTA - Your daughter is right the dress code is unfair - her education was sacrificed because other people might find her 'distracting' - Think about that - adults are sexualizing your daughter and punishing her by sending her home. Telling her that the way she dresses is more important than her education. And you punish her and give her the SAME MESSAGE. I shouldn't have to say to you that your daughter's education is more important than her skirt length. You should have stood up for your daughter and her education by standing up to that sexist principal and dress code. You should have been more understanding when your daughter was sharing her feelings about it, because of how you responded you made it clear to her that you don't care how she feels, she will just be punished. There are a lot of better and kinder things you should have done. So YTA", "YTA.

If not, you don't have any business being a parent.", "YTA as you couldn't see what the problem was with her outfit, I wouldn't have grounded her. I would have just told her to look over the dress code again and make sure she follows the rules. As long as it was a \"one time\" thing I think grounding her was a bit much.", "YTA she didn't break any rules, and you grounded her? It's not *her* fault that administration decided knees were too distracting for the poor little boys trying to learn. Take your annoyance out of the people who deserve it. The people denying your kid her education bc they're sexist assholes. \n\nYou're a huge asshole, js. You taught your daughter that you will punish her for whatever pisses you off, not just for breaking rules.", "Apologize. The dress code puts responsibility on girls to make boys act like responsible, respectful of others human beings rather than holding the male population of the school (both teachers/administrators & students) responsible for their behavior.\n\nStop the punishment. You're wrong. The school is wrong. Your daughter is right.\n\nYTA\n\nedit", "YTA. Why aren't you helping her with this instead of punishing her?

This fully grown principal is distracted by a teen girl's clothing choice? I am assuming her skirt was just above the knee, and from what I know knees arnt distracting. \n\nYou let this principal embarrass you and you did not stand up for your daughter.

OMG, horrifying! \ud83d\ude44\n\nIf she's ever sexually assaulted are you going to ask her what she was wearing?", "YTA. You're responsible for making sure your daughter has appropriate clothes for school, and for defending her if she is wearing a skirt that should be long enough.", "YTA. You saw nothing wrong with her outfit but punished her anyway. You didn't known about the dress code and you are responsible for buying her clothes. So it's your fault you had to leave work.", "YTA. She already got dress coded and presumably pulled out of class in front of everyone for it. She got told my a grown ass man that her outfit was distracting. How is that not punishment enough? \n\nDon't punish your daughter because of a stupid rule that neither of you probably knew about. If you didn't have an issue with her outfit, then the school shouldn't either.", "YTA, you rather punish your kid, for rules that mostly adult man wrote, and don't see the problem? She wore a skirt with pants under them, she didn't do anything wrong.", "YTA.\n\nAnd the mysogeny you continue to spout in your own household is gross.\n\nYour child's school is sexualizing your child.", "YTA, her school admin is being sexist and she needs someone to stick up for her, not punish her.", "YTA.

Oh, right, you were embarrassed because you were signing onto the bullshit and oh noes your daughter was existing as a female where males could see her knees and maybe have non-educational thoughts!\n\nYou owe Kandi more than an apology.

To whom? Boys who shouldn\u2019t be looking anyway?\n\nYou just reinforced to your daughter that she is responsible for men and boys actions and absolved them if any responsibility.\n\nIf she were my daughter, I would have got back into the principal\u2019s business asking why the school has such a misogynistic attitude toward girls and their bodies and demand to see the curriculum for the boys to respect the girls right to self.  Surely if they are putting the onus on the girls to not distract the boys, they also have a rigorous training for the boys in how to respect the girls autonomy and bodies.  \n\nThen call this out to the school board and the press if such training does not exist.\n\nUntil we have conversations with the gender that comprises the majority perpetrators of sexual assault, and continue to victim blame, thus attitude will never change.\n\nSorry for the rant, but not only do you owe your daughter an apology, but you owe her actions to others to show that they are wrong, not her!!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
