Bassets are extremely capable of training their human and this one has trained his to leave him alone until he asks for something.", "Little kids may not know how to properly interact with dogs. Also, older dogs can get grouchy. My dog started randomly biting when he got old and sickly. It's safer to keep an unpredictable dog away from little kids.", "Not all dogs want to be bothered with people. I have a couple younger house hippos who want nothing more than to be right up in the crack of my ass and then I have an older mutt who wants meals on time and to mostly be left alone.

Dog trainer and vet tech here. Some dogs prefer life to be this way. They are old and crnky. Some are just aloof and prefer to just be left alone. They could give zero fucks if they get attention.

Absolutely NTA.", "I think you handled this extremely well, OP. Actions > consequences > but not horrible ones (i.e. everyone is still staying with you, and Donovan still rules).
