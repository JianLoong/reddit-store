You obviously needed some space for a bit - nothing wrong with that.", "NTA Your son \"fucked about and found out.\" You gave him an easy rule to follow. Leave the dog alone. What did he do? He broke the rule. He is lucky he got scott free where no one got hurt and 50 bucks to watch a movie or do something with his kids.", "NTA, you really didn\u2019t kick them out.   You financed them going out for the afternoon and giving you and Donavan some peace.", "NTA and I laughed this entire post. \n\n>Now he is upset that he will be missing the game.\n\nOh noes your poor adult son has to entertain his own children on your dime because he didn't respect your house rules.

You didn't even \"kick him out\" just told him to fuck off for a bit If i'm understanding this correctly.

He\u2019s a big ole grouch and spends most of his time in his chair. Yes, he has his own chair, and everyone, even the other dogs know it\u2019s his. Plus, 12 is really, really old for a basset. Poor Donovan should have to deal with all that.", "I hope so. She's a great person. My son is pretty good too. He just gets obsessed with sports sometimes.", "I'm just booting him for the afternoon.", "i feel like OP was being humorous. his entire post is quite humorous i think", "I have a 13 year old hound, when she was younger she did great with kids, now that she is older I tell my grandkids to,leave her be. If she is outside let her sun herself. But leave her alone", "Some dogs don\u2019t do well with small children. They\u2019re loud and unpredictable and smaller dogs especially can be wary of them.

He was a very good dog with my older grandchildren when he was younger.", "I\u2019ve owned many bassets and I can assure you this is the dog\u2019s decision not OP\u2019s.  The dog is the equivalent of 80+ years old and just wants to be left alone to rest.  Bassets are extremely capable of training their human and this one has trained his to leave him alone until he asks for something.", "Little kids may not know how to properly interact with dogs. Also, older dogs can get grouchy. My dog started randomly biting when he got old and sickly. It's safer to keep an unpredictable dog away from little kids.", "Not all dogs want to be bothered with people. I have a couple younger house hippos who want nothing more than to be right up in the crack of my ass and then I have an older mutt who wants meals on time and to mostly be left alone. In fact, he'll get up and leave the room if you sit too close to him. I get it. The older I get the more I understand this behavior. OP and his dog seem to get along just fine. Not everyone needs to conform to your ideal of dog ownership.", "I was about to ask if he's 14 but then i remembered you mentioned he has a family. \n\nThat should tell you what I think of the situation.

Dog trainer and vet tech here. Some dogs prefer life to be this way. They are old and crnky. Some are just aloof and prefer to just be left alone. They could give zero fucks if they get attention.

That's NOT the same thing as telling kids to leave the dog alone", "Op doesn't interact with his own dog!", "And that means that it's ok for you to ignore your own dog?", "This isn't about when the kids are there! Even when there's nobody else in the home, op ignores his dog", "OP should text him a pic of him and Donovan watching the game.", "Other than actually I did take care of it you are correct.", "Only when there's company about. And, as an older dog, I bet Donovan is happy to go away when interloper steal his living room.", "My dog is old. He does not go for walks. He eats, farts, and sleeps. Same as me.", "I didn\u2019t get that impression at all. In fact, when there was an incident between the dog and the grandkids he put the grandkids outside.

Bassets at that age are basically just warm stinky throw pillows that groan a lot.  Donovan probably was unaware he was missing out on anything other than the nap your son interrupted", "Read the first paragraph again"]}
