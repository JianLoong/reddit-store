One friend \"Damien\"(17M) got injured there. We had a trampoline out back, he tried doing a flip in the air but went forward and hit his head right on the steel frame. He needed stitches and I think surgery, and his parents were beyond pissed at us. They sued, we lost, and idk exactly how much we owe them but my parents are still paying for it. EDIT: It's been over six figures paid so far and the injury was in my freshmen year, I am a senior now.\n\nMoney has been real tight ever since, my parents don't like talking about it to me but I overhear conversations all the time. We haven't been able to go on trips, gifts have been worse, we struggle to pay bills and last month I overheard my mom crying to hers that we are dangerously close to losing our house. They did admit to me that they won't be able to help with tuition like what was planned, so I'm working, and tutoring, doing schoolwork and trying to get scholarships so I can go to the college of my choice and not be in debt like they are. My parents have been unhappy ever since and so have I.\n\nI stopped talking to Damien because I hate what his family did to us but because we were in the same friend group we still share mutual friends, and they wish I could make up but I don't want to. Just recently he reached out with several paragraphs saying that he's been wracked with guilt over what happened and wants to make things right, even offering to give me money for school. I responded saying no, I'm not accepting charity just to make him feel better and I'll never forgive him for doing something stupid to get himself hurt at our house, and that karma will one day come for him and his family. Well, that got around our group and all my friends are calling me an AH for not letting things go, and that his mental health is suffering from his guilt but I think that's his cross to bear.

I feel bad since he got hurt but usually if the situation like that is between friends you sue for insurance reasons, not to go after a friend. Obviously this had a huge impact on your life and your family both financially and mentally because it is a constant reminder.\n\nI think it is your choice what to do with that friendship and non one should pressure you otherwise. Shame on those people for calling you AH!

Not Damien. I don\u2019t think he really did anything wrong by attempting to apologize. But I don\u2019t think you have any obligation to forgive him or accept his help. However, you saying how karmas gonna come for him was a bit much. He was a stupid 14/15 year old kid who tried to impress everybody, failed, and his parents went crazy with it. Should he have not done it? Absolutely. Should your anger be directed more at his parents than him? Again, yes. No one is saying you have to forgive him or anything.

You are justified in no longer wanting to engage with him, and his guilt riddled attempt to pay is both sickening and shocking.

You do not need to be friends with someone whose family has tried to destroy your family for financial gain. If your friends don\u2019t see how serious this is then they are not real friends. If he genuinely feels bad and has apologized, you may wish to forgive him one day. After all, the stupid mistake may have been his, but his parents are the one that went after your parents. Try not to blame him too much for his parents actions.", "Info: did Damien agree with his family to sue?\n\nIf he did then NTA. If he didn't then ~~YTA~~ still NTA, changed my mind cause it is your decision to forgive and it seems like there is still strong emotions there. \n\n I understand your perspective, and it is your call to forgive.

It\u2019s very odd that your parents are having to make direct monthly payments, because even if his parents won a civil judgment, laws explicitly protect personal assets like homes & dedicated collage funds.", "NAH. Your friend's parents had the right to sue for his medical bills since the injury occurred on your parents' property; if it caused this much of a dent in their finances, they were probably made to pay additional fees like lawyers fees, court fees, & anything else they can tack on as well as add in a set amount in the event that his injuries need medical attention in the future. Your parents should have been informed of the risks when they bought one especially since some home owner insurance policies have stipulations that injuries occurring from one will not be paid by the policy.\n\nYou don't have to forgive them & act like nothing happened but his parents were well within their rights; if the situation was reversed, your parents would probably do the same thing.", "NTA\n\nAnd I doubt your parents or his parents want you to be friends again.

This wouldn't happen in any other country. Imagine ruining a family's whole future because your teenage son did a teen dumb and got hurt. Jesus.", "NAH - I think it sounds like sadly, everyone is trying to do their best to move forward.  Your parents don't talk about it with you, as well they shouldn't ... but also there are things that you may not know about - like did your parents not have the correct type of insurance that usually covers these kinds of things?  Have they tried any other legal action in reverse to get out from under the debt, like even filing bankruptcy (not sure if that makes this kind of debt to go away or not)  Or maybe there could be other issues that you aren't aware of as to the bind they are in financially that may have nothing to do with the law suit... Your friends don't understand how it's affecting your life either, and yet what is going on in your family isn't really any of their business.  Finally, he was a kid, it could have happened to *any* kid at your party -- and at the same time, he had absolutely no control over what his parents did (suing yours).  It's a tangled mess.  \n\nIn all honesty, I'd probably consider sitting down with mom & dad and tell them what is going on with him & your friends. You never know, you might learn some things you didn't know, be surprised if they don't hold the kid responsible like you are or on the other hand, you might get backing from them in support of how you've handled it.", "NTA.

His parents sounds unforgiving,  but don't punish your ex friend for it. \n\nLet it go.  Nobody said you had to hang out again.", "NTA. I would be blunt with him that your family is struggling and may end up homeless because of his stupidity. No empty apology will ever undo the damage he has caused. If he had actual remorse he would ask his parents to stop future payments.

Your parents accepted the risk by having a trampoline, they further exposed the family to financial crisis by allowing your friends to use the trampoline. Some homeowners insurance policies exclude coverage for injuries sustained on trampolines. Again, it was their responsibility to know their policies and accepted the risk. Hate to tell you this, but if the same thing happened and the kiddo injured was your cousin, your aunt/uncles would have sued. In fact, the medical insurance carrier likely denied all coverage as the injury occurred where another party was at fault - your parents. So all the financial sacrifices your family have faced - is your parents fault - not this kid and his family.", "NTA\n\nBut don't be afraid to take his money, especially with how much your parents are struggling financially.

He should feel guilty, and so should his family. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I mean I seriously don't understand the lets sue culture in the USA.  It's ridiculous.  When I was growing up my friends and I used to do stupid things we weren't supposed to, I ended up with black eyes on occasion, at the emergency room for tetanus shots, stitches, but never once did it enter mine or my parents mind to sue my friends' parents if the injury happened at their place. I was responsible for my own stupidity in getting hurt, no one else.\n\nYou don't have to accept any apologies.  Damien was responsible for his own injuries and neither you nor your parents should have to pay him or his family anything.  My take is they are greedy AH's.  If your so called friends continue to call you an AH, tell them that your parents are likely going to lose their home and can't help you with university tuition due to Damien's stupidity and his family's greed, so they should be sympathising with you not him because his actions have f'd up your family and their finances.  He should feel guilty and he deserves to live with that guilt as a consequence of his actions.", "NTA\n\nFYI Damien isn\u2019t your only trash friend.", "Definitely NTA\n\nHe is the one who decided to do something stupid and hurt himself, then his AH parents sued your parents, after their AH did something to Hurt himself so they didn\u2019t have to foot the medical bill for their idiot son.\n\nYou are so NTA in that situation, and you do not have to forgive him.\n\nHis family put yours in a really shit situation, yes, it was probably his parents that decided to sue, but he is just as much to blame.", "NTA It is a shame that this happened. Your entitled to your feelings, and you can't change those feelings just because it makes others uncomfortable. I would at the very least feel some resentment.\n\nOnce  your out of high school you won't be forced into such close proximity every day with these people.
