I am anxious and confused about the situation going on in my family and I'll try to explain it as well as I can.\n\nWhen I was 12, my brother was born. During this period I pretty much started babysitting him, coming home from school at around 2PM and staying with him so that my mom could do whatever work she had to do/go shopping for groceries. Not only that, but I also babysat him whenever I was on holiday break, including all summer vacations. I ended up staying with him for well over 8 hours daily sometimes, more than my parents.\n\nNow, my brother is turning 6 and doesn't speak properly. He's doing speech therapy and has been getting better. He acted up once at kindergarten which made my mom blame my dad and he got angry, not coming home that day and my mom let my brother cry about it and told him it's his fault as to why he's not home. My mom doesn't do much around the house as she sleeps most afternoons, but she said I also make messes so my dad told me to clean up after myself, so I did.\n\nI came from school once and ate, washing my dishes after out of habit. She then came into my room, asking me if my dad taught me to only wash my own things and started crying. She went on the phone with her friend and after calming down came into my room again to tell me that I'm disrespectful towards her and just like my father. I told her that the whole situation is making me tense and she was condescending about it. I didn't mean to exclude her dishes or anything, but she also said she deliberately left them there to see what I'd do.\n\nToday (and why I decided to make this post) they fought again, and my mom brought me into it. I have vocational work at school and need to pass it, and decided to go to my dad's workplace instead since the teacher agreed and I'd actually do something. My mom found out today and freaked out, telling me I should let her know when I make decisions like these (even though I'm nearly 18) and said that she raised a snake.\n\nI know I could have raised my brother better even if it wasn't my obligation, but I spent my entire adolescence with him and I wasn't patient enough. My mom said she wants a divorce and 5000 euros, and told my dad to sell the house if he doesn't have the money (I don't know where I would live, not that he's gonna sell it.)\n\nMy dad has also talked about her when it's only me home, but not to this extent and mostly saying that he doesn't know what to do next. He did say the reason my brother's not talking properly is because she never spends time with him and never plays with him which I have thought about as well before. He tries to spend time with him but is busy.\n\nI honestly don't know what to make of all this anymore, is there a side to my mother's arguments that I'm not seeing? Does she just come tired from work and I should have helped her more, or is my dad also in the wrong here?

First of all, your brother was not your responsibility and neither is your parents marriage. Secondly, this dynamic seems very very unhealthy. Your parents shouldn't be making you choose sides and calling you a snake if you are around your other parent. It seems like your mother is taking a lot out on you. I hope you can get some space from the situation soon.", "Oh honey no NTA in a massive way. While it is incredibly kind that you spent that time with your brother he is not your responsibility to parent, that falls to your parents. Your only job as a child is to be the best version of yourself that you can and from the limited information we have on this post you have done that beautifully and even more. It is unfair of your mom to not only blame you for not taking over her responsibilities as a parent but for not being a parent to her. If you can while you are still in school I would talk to your dad about the way your mom not only seems to take advantage of you but him as well and if he truly doesn\u2019t know what to do to reach out to a teacher, friends parent or other trusted adult . It is not healthy for you to put the pressure of holding your family together on your own shoulders.", "You are NTA. Your mom definitely is TA. Too little information on the dad, but I would guess also TA, since both of them dumped the responsibility of raising your brother onto you.", "NTA.  Your mom has an ongoing problem, which sounds like severe depression.  She\u2019s blaming you instead of taking responsibility for her own problems.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that your parents marriage is failing, mostly because of your mother's behavior.  It also seems like when she is upset she takes it out on you, even for stuff that is not really your fault or problem.

She doesn't have the skills to be a parent and instead of seeing her own faults she's blaming others and should in no way be blaming you for them. You're in a tough spot and I hope your dad steps up to here and finds a way for you and your brother to live without her.", "NTA your mom sounds like she has a mental health issue. None of this is your fault and it sounds like you are an amazing older sibling.", "NTA, your parents are getting divorced and your brother was a \"save the marriage\" baby.", "NTA! 10,000% this is such a toxic environment for both you and your brother to be growing up in, maybe your mother has battled some PPD but this doesn't sound healthy, and no matter what they should not be dragging their kids into it. It sounds like your dad has tried his best to keep his marriage from effecting you and your brothers lives but sometimes things get messy. \n\nI am sorry that this is happening to you and your little brother. Also, it is not your job to have \"raised your brother better\" you are just a kid yourself and need to focus on being a kid. I know not everyone has that luxury but you are most certainly NTA in this whole situation.", "NTA you have been parentified and abused. Non of this was your responsibilty. Get Out of there as fast as you possibly can. And get into therapy!", "You have all the other comments telling you you shouldn\u2019t have been forced to look after your brother like that, and they\u2019re absolutely right, but I just wanted to ease your fear about being the cause of your brother being nonverbal. It is highly unlikely that you played any role in that, and your dad is correct that if there was any environmental factors it is your moms neglect. That said, it\u2019s possible just a regular speech or neurological disorder, and has nothing to do with you.", "NTA, sorry that your mom is so unhinged and trying to create drama out of everything and then blame everyone for everything, just stop listening to her, she needs help and your father needs to either divorce her or get her the help she needs.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to raise your brother. If he has a speech problem it's his mother's fault. They call your first language(s) your mother's tongue for a reason. It's because children learn speech from their mother's verbal and facial cues. It's why women are more verbal than men. \n\nI know many are going to say this argument is sexist but it's not. A child's early childhood development comes from its mother, not its older sibling(s). Even if OP is female (not stated but assuming) an older sibling is not a replacement for the mother/child bond in early childhood development.", "This post does not sound like someone asking for a judgement.

It is not your job to parent your brother - it is your job to be his big brother.\n\nYour dad is correct; by your mother not playing with him or spending time with him, this can cause reactive attachment disorder due to emotional neglect. It does sound like she has severe depression and should definitely see a GP about that, but she probably didn't look after your brother properly when you were at school and I'm guessing the only attention he got was from you.\n\nYour father may be busy, but he needs to step up as a parent as your brother is only 6 and needs a parent. Your mother needs to get help. If neither of them do this, they are the AH - be the best big brother you can be to your brother, leave the parenting to the parents, and try not to feel guilty  - this is not your fault, and not your problem to solve.", "NTA", "NTA - your mother sounds like a narcissist and possibly an alcoholic though you never mention substance abuse, I can almost smell it\n\nYou have been parentified, a type of abuse where you're made to do all the parenting. Your father is also TA because he uses manipulative and immature tactics against yourself and his wife (your mom). Basically your family is a thumbs down.\n\nyou have done nothing wrong, good luck on your studies, I'm sorry your mother is so self centered", "Your mother needs professional help. \n\nThis has nothing to do with you. Your brother isn't your fault. I was a twelve year old terrified I was going to screw up a toddler's moral development. Kids deserve an adult, not another kid. NTA.", "NTA find a way away from your mom. She sounds like a problem. I take it your mom is a stay at home depressed mom. It\u2019s sad, but it does not make her healthy for anybody to be around. Definitely didn\u2019t help that dad also checked out on mom.", "It's just that staying/watching over a kid is much easier than raising one so I think I could have done more", "I couldn't fit it all into the post, but my dad works a lot and can't spend much time with him. He said before that the reason as to why he doesn't talk is my mother not spending time with him and that he's gonna try and make more time.", "This. OP, none of this is your fault. You have done a wonderful thing being there for your brother but that doesn't mean it is your ongoing responsibility.\n\nNext time your Mom blames you, gently suggest she talk to a doctor because she seems very depressed and her behavior towards you and your brother is not okay and it is scaring you.\n\nThat said, I think this is an area your Dad has to fight - he needs to encourage her to get some mental healthcare.", "Oh for heavens sake. This would mean babies adopted by 2 gay men would never learn to speak.", "I am a male, I forgot to mention that", "It sounds like a young kid being guilted into feeling responsible by his mother for his brother's developmental delays, and looking for an outside perspective.  But for some reason you want him to feel bad about that?", "Sorry if it comes across that way, I'm really just trying to figure out if there's anything I did wrong", "Neither of them were your responsibility though my love. If you spent more time with your brother than either parent did than you were raising him, even if nobody acknowledges it. His development and any delays are not marks against you because you were/are a child yourself. He needs you to be his brother not his parent and you both need someone that will put the pair of you above themselves because that is what you deserve and I\u2019m sorry your parents couldn\u2019t give that to you. However none of that is your fault and that to me is the most important thing you can take away from any of these comments.", "Never said that at all. You're twisting my words. Children raised by two gay men will still be exposed to their aunts, grandmothers, female friends, teachers etc. Children have to be exposed to all voice pitches and ages. I specifically stated that in my previous comments.\n\nBut the BEST way for early speech development is the child's interactions with their mother. The child hears their mother's voice in the womb and that starts the foundation of speech before they're born. My comment isn't in the context of gay couples at all. You are inserting that context when it doesn't apply here. My comment was specifically based on OP being the child's sibling, not his mother.", "My argument prevails! I'm speaking as someone who's learned multiple languages in adulthood. \n\nThe human ear reactions differently to a high pitched female voice when learning a language than a low pitched male voice. While you need to hear both genders voices (from different age ranges i.e. other children and old people) most early speech is developed from a child hearing its mothers voice and seeing their mother's facial expressions.", "You did nothing wrong. Your mother on the other hand...she had a kid, neglected it, fobbed it off to her other kid, and then blamed the caregiving kid for her responsibilities.  Why on earth did she have kids if she wasn't going to care for them? Why didn't your Dad help when you were rearing your baby bro?\n\n\nDefinitely NTA but you need to GTFO from that toxic environment sooner than later. Your mother is a venomous B.", "Your parents failed you both here. This was never your fault.  NTA.", "Person qualified in psychology & child protection here. u/crazybutlookincute is 100% correct OP \u2014 none of your brother\u2019s developmental delays are any fault of yours & your parents have failed you both (as others have said it\u2019s hard to say much about your dad but your mum has definitely let you down). I\u2019m frustrated for you that no one seems to have picked up on your situation during your secondary school years to provide you with the support you so clearly needed & still need. You\u2019re still a child though, technically, so it may not be too late to reach out for that kind of help \u2014 plus your brother is still very young so he will also likely need emotional support on top of his speech therapy.\n\nPlease reach out to a trusted adult to help you cope with this; you\u2019ve done so well for so long but adulthood is approaching & you deserve to have & enjoy your own life without worrying about your brother. Your mum obviously is unwell in some way so she needs help too but that doesn\u2019t excuse her letting you down so monumentally. I wish I could give you a hug & make sure you know how wonderful you have been & what a brilliant young man you will grow into.", "> Children have to be exposed to all voice pitches and ages. I specifically stated that in my previous comments.\n\nI met a three year old toddler child who spoke like a old gay queen with the body language to match - NOBODY in his family speaks that way, I'd never seen such inherent mannerisms. His father was appalled. I remain astonished as I watched the kid grow from a baby to a toddler, so wild - just a little baby queen through and through."]}
