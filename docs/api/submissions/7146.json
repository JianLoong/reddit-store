We both work, but neither of us could afford to live alone, so we decided to rent this new place together. She is on the lease to build a rental record and references for when she wants to get a place of her own.\n\nDaughter and I are very close and have a great relationship. I work from home and have my own ensuite bathroom attached to my bedroom, and daughter has the main bathroom and separate toilet. I earn most of the money and pay for all of the food and do the majority of the cooking and cleaning; she pays half the rent and half the internet. My 12 year old son also lives with us. \n\nRecently my daughter was talking about having her boyfriend (20) move in with us. This isn\u2019t an emergency housing situation, just something that my daughter and her partner want. The boyfriend is polite enough and is kind and respectful to her but my daughter pays for everything, drives him everywhere, and leaves him here in the house while she\u2019s at work. He is a very, very overweight guy and keeps all of the fans running all the time in the house, and he tends to clean out the pantry when he stays over. His moving in would also require modifications to be made to the property to accommodate his mobility issues which would be on us if he wasn\u2019t added onto the lease with approval from the landlord.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t affect my daughter much because she gets lots of great quality free food at work, but it can be a problem for my son and I. When there\u2019s nothing left to eat in the kitchen, boyfriend will order delivery to the house and go into my daughter\u2019s room to eat it. \n\nThis can be very frustrating, because although we aren\u2019t dirt poor, we are far from well-off and we live paycheck to paycheck. I also find it a bit rude that he orders delivery and doesn\u2019t ask us if we want anything even though he knows we\u2019re hungry, as we feed him very regularly and I never order without asking him what he\u2019d like (son doesn\u2019t like takeaway, so he doesn\u2019t order). \n\nDaughter\u2019s opinion is that she is a leaseholder and they have their own bathroom to use, so it shouldn\u2019t be any extra burden in terms of capacity. She says he won\u2019t be paying any rent, but she pays half the rent when I have my 12 year old son living with us who also doesn\u2019t pay rent, so if her boyfriend moves in we\u2019ll be even by each having a person to cover the rent for. \n\nI\u2019m uncomfortable with this and I told her so. She was surprised, upset and disappointed, and thinks that I am both treating her as a child and discriminating against her boyfriend because of his weight. She is hoping that I\u2019ll change my mind on this, but I have no intention of doing so. AITA?\n\n*Edit to address some points raised in the comments: we live in New Zealand where there is a rental crisis with availability below 2% and rents are cripplingly high. People working full time are failing to get rentals due to a combination of huge rents and low availability. Daughter and her boyfriend have almost zero chance of renting a place of their own with no rental history and one income. Not their fault, these are hard times.\n\nI can afford to pay the rent on my own, but it would make things tough and consume about 70% of my total income. We could do it if we ate beans and rice and nothing else. The situation is beneficial for both of us, as otherwise my daughter would need to live with an elderly grandparent who she clashes with quite badly. \n\nShe does have a say in everything that goes on in the house - pets are allowed on the lease so she has two small dogs now. Her bathroom has a spa bath, separate enclosed shower and a separate toilet, 12 year old brother uses the en-suite bathroom in my room because he likes it better. I do all of the cleaning and laundry except for cleaning her room because I never go in there. I try my best to give her a fair deal", "created_utc": 1673533129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a0qq5/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_my_daughter_move_her/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm all for supporting your children in every way..that's what being a parent is (to me at least).  But it's also your house, and when you aren't forcing overbearing or unreasonable ideals or rules upon your child.. I think that saying someone can't move into your house with the sole reason of \"I own this house, I love you and you can be your own person, but I also don't have to bend to everything you say\" is beyond reasonable.  And while I do feel alot of empathy for young adults, I don't think that you're out of line by any means.  I honestly think that it's a little shitty for your daughter to tell you that your fat-phobic because you don't want an extra person living in your house full time. Especially for a boyfriend of a 19 year old.   I genuinely am not trying to shit talk your child by the way.  I just know that it'll create all kinds of problems.  She breaks up with him, and what steps are you now taking if he  physically refuses to leave your house?", "NTA this is not a matter of him being overweight, it\u2019s a matter of you pay majority of the bills she pays half of the rent and half of the internet.

I cannot remember if renters insurance is included but you get the point. \n\nAdd all together and divide by the number of people in the home. Adding another person to that will make the fair share for each person go down however, ole dude is not your problem. You are paying for the fair share of you and your minor child.", "NTA. She has introduced an irresponsible element to your house and he's not even paying for his own upkeep.\n\nShe needs to start buying her own food and paying half of all of the bills if you're trying to do this as a learning experience.

He isn\u2019t family and her brother is a minor. \n\nYou both need an agreement that limits the number of hours guests may visit, which hours they are allowed to be visiting, and that guests are only permitted when the host is present. This agreement should apply to both of you. \n\nSince your daughter thinks that she\u2019s an equal contributor to this household, you may have no choice but to divide up the chores, the utility bills, and the grocery bills.", "NTA and keep hope , don't let her do it. I was also a 19 y/o girl who dated a loser without a job. After a while she'll find her worth and realize she wants someone who can support themselves.", "I  laughed at her argument that your TWELVE YEAR OLD doesn't pay rent lmao \n\nNTA - adults gotta pay rent, so daughter should at least offer to pay more for bf. He cant just come in a be a freeloader", "NTA does he have a job? Your utilities will go up probably already have with him there so much. The food bill you pay for has obviously already increased since he\u2019s eating the food you buy. If you are not comfortable with him moving in he should not move in. Her thinking he or she will not have to contribute more is crazy. There\u2019s more than just rent here and if she wants to support him that\u2019s her problem. Big difference between a 12 year old son/brother and a grown man. Edit to add sounds like his weight is causing health and mobility issues. She needs to be more concerned about helping him with that. If he does not want to address these issues which will just get worse as he gets older that is a serious issue she needs to address if she wants a relationship with him. That should not be your problem.", "NTA, he is not a dependent minor like your son so there is no comparison there and further he shows that he doesn't respect your personal property.  If it comes down to him moving in or them moving out then maybe tell her he can move in when he has a fulltime job for more than a month and that he is expected to pay 1/3 of the rent.", "**NTA**\n\nIt's really as simple as this: \n\nWhen moving in and setting up a household, you did not agree to this man being an established and official part of it. You are uncomfortable with adding him to the household, and *it doesn't really matter what your reasons are for that, you do not have to allow people to move into your household who make you uncomfortable for any reason* *unless they have a legal claim to tenancy*. Which he does not. Everything else here is irrelevant. \n\nIf your daughter feels that strongly about living with her boyfriend, then she should plan to move out and start a new, separate household with him. She does not have a right to impose him on you. Again, your reasons are irrelevant; you do not have to live with someone if the idea makes you uncomfortable. Period. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nEven if you did agree, he's 20 and would need to be contributing to rent, utilities, FOOD, etc to not be a burden.\n\nAnd even as a roommate, any apartment lease charges more when additional tenants move in.\n\nAnd it's absolutely entitled and ridiculous for her to compare that your 12 year old son doesn't pay rent. He's a MINOR and legally dependent on you.\n\nYou're not obligated to support her deadbeat BF who's looking for a free ride.", "NTA.", "NTA, remind her of the extra bills you have been covering.  However, now that you both have an extra person, she can pick up her share.  Also get real about the grocery bill.  Bf is not a zero sum gain, he costs money to have around.  Even if he doesn\u2019t move in, that needs to be addressed.", "NTA. But OP do think carefully. You said you can\u2019t afford to live alone. If your daughter has to move out in order to live with her boyfriend then that will likely be what happens when the lease is up. Not even being malicious. She just wants to live with her boyfriend and that\u2019s the only option.", "NTA. There's a big difference between a 12 year old boy that has no way to make enough money to pay rent, and a grown-ass adult who sounds like he's just too lazy to get a job. If I were you, I would get a locking bin to put all the food that YOU buy into. If your daughter is okay with him eating all of her food, that's on her - but you don't need to subsidize his meals.\n\nYou might want to check with your landlord to see if your lease allows for another person to move in. If it doesn't, tell your daughter that the bf moving in will violate the lease and could cause all of you to be evicted.", "Nta she wants a fully capable adult to move in and not contribute to the household at all. She needs to understand her brother is a child there is a big difference. Now if she had changed it up offered him paying money and they both should split groceries than perhaps it would have been at least more reasonable request than hey let him freeload here full time", "NTA.\n\nHer trying to equate her boyfriend to your younger child, who you are LEGALLY responsible for, is a false equivalency. You are also on the lease and you can say no. If she wants to live with him she can move in somewhere else. Your concerns are valid and you have another child to think about.", "NTA - she\u2019s showing her immaturity.  Her pantry emptying boyfriend in no way compares to her minor sibling.  He doesn\u2019t bring anything to the living arrangements but sure is reaping all the benefits.\n\nWhen he is there, start keeping a tally of what he is consuming that you purchased.  Look at you electric bills and try and figure how much he has added to the usage.\n\nPresent this information to your daughter and inform her if she wants to reimburse you for what he consumes and uses, you would consider it.  Tell her you are not taking on someone else to provide for.", "Info- have you started looking for a new roommate yet? Your daughter isn't going to allow you to prevent her from living with her boyfriend forever.", "NTA. If you two are in a roomate situation then both have to agree on a change. Since you dont agree its a no go situation.", "NTA. But it sounds like your daughter might want to take a long hard look at this BF who is mooching off her and her family. \n\nHowever, you probably need to start thinking of how you\u2019re going to pay the bills - eventually she will move out.", "NTA, once the hobosexual gets comfortable, he\u2019s not going anywhere. Do not let him get a foothold. You\u2019re better off getting somewhere smaller with her if she won\u2019t budge.", "NTA \n\nOkay, if the argument is that you would each have one extra person in the house, yes rentwise you have an equal split. What she however fail to account for is that even though rent doesn't become more expensive with an extra person in the house, ALL the other bills (which only YOU pay) will go up. Electric and water bills AND FOOD! All if which becomes more expensive by the day. Is she/he going to contribute to make up for that? If not, no deal.", "NTA. \n\nIt'd be one thing if he would be paying rent or contributing to the bills. But a 12 year old and an unemployed, free loader adult male isn't a fair comparison. \n\nWho pays other utilities? Or is it included in rent? \n\nI know you pay all of the food cost, but she does get free food from work so how much does that benefit her? I think 50/50 rent may not be fair as I assume the 12 year old gets his own room, you are getting the bedroom with an ensuite bathroom. Whose bathroom does the 12 year old use? She is paying for half of rent while it sounds like she is getting less than what your half covers. If you are covering other utilities fully, then this seems fair. \n\nI know that wasn't your question, but I am thinking that may need to be reevaluated as she may feel like the BF moving in IS fair due to the current agreement seeming/being unfair to her", "Firstly, NTA if what you're saying is 100% truthful.\n\nSecondly, if your daughter wants to live with her bf, they should get a place together and you find another adult that has a job to be the roommate. I do have to mention though that his weight has no factor in this, because I know people that are stick skinny that eat like a horse.\n\nMy (44F) daughter's (19) boyfriend (21) moved in with our family (myself, husband \\[52\\] and son \\[14\\] and daughter \\[19\\]) three years ago. \n\nHe had a HORRIBLE home life though and always contributes. He works FT at an Amazon warehouse, pays a nominal rent, has chores and will even occasionally go to the market get food and cook everyone dinner. \n\nThere's NEVER a time that he decides to order food delivery or even go to get food without asking the entire family if they want anything. \n\nHe's absolutely respectful and grateful, because he definitely wouldn't be where he is today without us. He even starts school for his BBA at the end of Feb.", "I agree another adult needs to pay rent. And contribute heavily to groceries. However if your son has his own room, I also get her point that you should be paying more for him to have that space. Since if two strangers were renting a house, the one with a child who needed an extra bedroom would naturally pay more. Except that wasn't the terms she agreed to, so she can't really back peddle now.\n\nMaybe let's leave his weight out if it.", "NTA \n\n\nYou and your daughter moved in as roommates. Which means that if she doesn't want to re-sign in a year to move in with her boyfriend, that's a choice. But he should not be moving in to a house you are renting together unless everyone is in agreement. \n\n\nAnd you have to address him eating all the food you pay for. He or your daughter need to provide his food, if he's eating enough to make it difficult for you to eat.\n\n\nBut you should be paying significantly more than half the rent if you are paying for you and your son. Does your son sleep in your bedroom or have his own?", "NTA. She can go rent a separate place with her boyfriend when the lease is up. You don\u2019t have to have a grown ass man move in to your place for free while eating all your food and driving up the utilities. She is out of line.

You can then draw up an agreement that caps your monthly costs for you and your son.

You also mentioned that you buy all of the food but your daughter mostly eats at work, so I don\u2019t think that expense counts towards your daughter\u2019s share. Also, since she is an adult, if she chooses to pay for him and drive him around, that\u2019s irrelevant.

When there\u2019s nothing left to eat in the kitchen, boyfriend will order delivery to the house and go into my daughter\u2019s room to eat it. \n\nThis can be very frustrating, because although we aren\u2019t dirt poor, we are far from well-off and we live paycheck to paycheck. I also find it a bit rude that he orders delivery and doesn\u2019t ask us if we want anything even though he knows we\u2019re hungry, as we feed him very regularly and I never order without asking him what he\u2019d like (son doesn\u2019t like takeaway, so he doesn\u2019t order). \n\nDaughter\u2019s opinion is that she is a leaseholder and they have their own bathroom to use, so it shouldn\u2019t be any extra burden in terms of capacity. She says he won\u2019t be paying any rent, but she pays half the rent when I have my 12 year old son living with us who also doesn\u2019t pay rent, so if her boyfriend moves in we\u2019ll be even by each having a person to cover the rent for. \n\nI\u2019m uncomfortable with this and I told her so. She was surprised, upset and disappointed, and thinks that I am both treating her as a child and discriminating against her boyfriend because of his weight.

I'm confused", "One roommate could say to the other, \"You're not on the lease. Move out.\"", "Yes this 100 percent", "agreed", "So, if he moved in, he would be able to pay rent just like he does at his brother\u2019s?", "Also to clarify: We live in New Zealand, the rental crisis here is biting hard and even people working full time jobs are being priced out of the rental market. Availability is below 2%. Daughter has no hope of moving out with her boyfriend with no prior rental history and with only one income. We were lucky that we secured a property. I could afford to hold the place up if she decided to move out, but it would be a bit of a beans and rice in the pantry situation. If I was paying the rent on my own it would consume just over half of my weekly income.", "Right! I was responding to the part where it says the daughter has a point if she pays half the rent\u2026 mom literally covers everything else", "Its still unnecessary info", "This isn\u2019t just random strangers though. This is her mother and younger brother. Completely different circumstances.", "I\u2019m not sure of the amount he pays his brother. The unemployment benefit is very low so I\u2019d suspect his contribution there is taking the vast majority of his income and it would be unlikely he\u2019d be able to contribute to utilities or possibly even food if he was required to pay an equal percentage of rent", "So there is no plan for this boyfriend to e v e r work? This is a huge red flag. If they want to live together than he should be actively trying to participate in the process. \n\nI think you need to hold your ground here Mom- this is a bad situation that is likely to become much worse. Once he\u2019s in you\u2019ll have a hell of a time getting him out!", ">I could afford to hold the place up if she decided to move out, but it would be a bit of a beans and rice in the pantry situation. If I was paying the rent on my own it would consume just over half of my weekly income.\n\nOr, given that there are other people out there who can't rent, you could find another roommate in about 2 weeks who would actually contribute.\n\nBut, lets be honest, you are not going to kick your daughter out because you love her and want to set her up for success.\n\nHowever, you shouldn't let her put you over a barrel either or think you don't have choices.\n\nFirst, BF is not moving in regardless of how many tantrums she throws. This is part of adulting and also of having roommates. Second, no more BF in the house when she is not there. Third, no more feeding BF (even if you have to put a lock on the food) or, alternatively, she needs to contribute to the food bill. Fourth, the number of days BF can stay over should also be limited.  \n\nI think BF is a bit too comfortable and needs to be made a bit uncomfortable. And I think your daughter needs to a few harsh realities of life (without being homeless).\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I would worry that this boyfriend, while nice, may be going down the road to permanent disability and never work or contribute.  Do not let him move in so you and your daughter can become his caretakers.", "Why?! It might be unnecessary if all she mentioned was him eating most of the food. But OP mentions his weight in reference to the fact that he uses multiple fans to keep cool. Fans that are being powered by electricity that they ALL pay for.", "She is still responsible for half the rent and she only get to use 1/3 of the space. OP should be charging her 1/3 rent for the single room she is using out if the 3 available. OP clearly doesnt like the boyfriend and is trying to use their position as a parent to dictate what their adult child does in a space that they pay for and are legally tied to. OP could move their food out of the kitchen and require that the daughter pay for half the utilities as a compromise. But ESH", "It definitely gets more complicated with family. But it is not the sister's responsibility to pay for her brothers lodgings. I mean, its what good family members do to support each other, but she isn't the one that brought him into the world and is responsible for his care.", "Daughter pays rent and internet. So mom is paying the bills for that", "My son that's 5'8\" and weighs 110 lbs. uses fans all the time and eats constantly. Weight is not a factor.", "She pays half rent and half internet. OP pays everything else including chores. I think it\u2019s a bit more than even. NTA"]}
