I had mum book her daughter in for a trim and colour with me, I\u2019m not their usual stylist. The stylist they usually go to is on holiday and I was recommended to them by a friend. When the mum booked the trim and colour in, she specified that her daughter had long hair and asked if that was ok for me to handle. The receptionist said yes because I have a lot of clients with waist length hair. Waist length is usually the longest hair I will cut, I have never had a client with hair longer than this. Due to issues with my knee, I can\u2019t kneel down for long. I\u2019m awaiting surgery.\r  \n\r  \nWhen they turned up for the appointment, the daughter had her hair up in a bun so I couldn\u2019t see the full length of her hair. The mum thanked me for being able to fit her daughter in, she said that when their usual stylist isn\u2019t available, it can be difficult to get her daughter an appointment due to her hair length. When the daughter sat in my chair, I asked her to take her hair down so that I could brush through it before we started her ombre colour. When she took her hair down, I noticed it was much longer than I expected. I asked her how long her hair was, and she said it was knee length. She brushed her hair back so that it was all going down the back of the chair and it was well past the length I was comfortable cutting at. I would have had to kneel down the colour and cut her hair. I waved the mum over as I told the daughter to take off the gown. I apologised to the mum and told her that I would not be able to cut her daughter\u2019s hair due to it\u2019s length. I explained that it was too long for me to cut as I could not kneel down to cut her hair. \r  \nUnderstandably, the mum was upset that I was refusing to cut her daughter\u2019s hair. She demanded the booking fee back. I informed her that the \u00a350 booking fee was non-refundable, and she would have been told this at time of booking. She then demanded to speak to the manager of the salon, I told her that I would get her the owner. \r  \n\r  \nThe owner of the salon did refund her the money. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t have taken the booking if I couldn\u2019t cut hair that long. I told her that the length had never been specified to me, the receptionist was just told long and that long hair in our area is usually no longer than waist length. She knows I can\u2019t kneel without being in pain. The mum has since been writing on the Facebook page of the salon, complaining that I refused to cut her daughter\u2019s hair because can\u2019t actually cut long hair. I feel bad that the mum is upset about this, but at the same time it was never specified how long her daughter\u2019s hair actually was.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for refusing to cut extremely long hair?", "created_utc": 1685311761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ucn7i/aita_for_refusing_to_cut_a_clients_extremely_long/", "score": 2108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like OP insisted on not refunding (based on the post). It seems like she mentioned it once, maybe twice, that it's the salon's policy, and as soon as the mom asked for the manager, OP got the manager. It'd be different if OP was insistent on not refunding or getting the manager. I'd even consider OP the AH if they said something like \"well the manager isn't going to refund based on policy\" but that didn't happen, again according to the post.\n\nOP literally did her job following salon policy, according to the post. I'm going with NTA because what else could OP have done? And the mom complaining on the salon's page about it makes the mom a bit of an AH. There's a huge difference between \"long hair\" and \"knee length.\" I mean, yeah technically knee length is long, but I don't think anyone will hear long hair and think knee length. The mom should've mentioned this, especially since it's hard to find someone specifically because of her daughter's hair length.", "You don't get nuance do you?

So yeah, it WAS her own reason. \n\nIf I go to a car repair and want my computer fixed, it's not their own reasons that they wont serve me - it's not a service they provide.\n\nIf you feel OP provides the service for ultra long hair when she doesn't, ok, that's what you feel.\n\n>Any other stylist without the knee problems would have been able to cut it\n\nThe mother says she knows it's hard to get an appointment for long hair, so it would seem not just anyone can do it and we are talking longer than long hair, so that'd presumably make it even harder.\n\n\"I know this is a hard task to perform, but I'm going to bring an even harder version of it without telling anyone that because no one made me say it because for some reason I don't have to say an important thing like that\"\n\nIf that seems reasonable, ok, cool", "Aw, poor wee thing (and you for being up late) all good, just showing solidarity on the OR/AND issue :) LLAP", "Lmao no way you\u2019ve ever had a job", "Depends if it's being treated that the customer can never be wrong (which also begs the question of why have a deposit to begin with?), in which case the customer defaults to right for never being able to be wrong.", "No no like I said, I agree. Hair length is absolutely essential to know by a stylist when it comes to a number of services and yes I'm being completely honest and not being sarcastic. I was definitely being sarcastic in that comment because the person seemed to be under the impression that the mom was trying to cheat OP or something. Like you said, hair length does matter. What I do not agree with was that the assumption made that the mom lied about the hair length. Honestly like I said, OP was only the AH for deciding the money would not be returned. And if the mom would have been rude or demanding that the hair colour/cut had to be done, OP was in the absolute right on keeping the booking money I'd think. I also don't think the customer is always right, at all", "But the policy is about people paying 50\u00a3 in advance, for if they not show up, so this isnt what happened so the employee cant work after the policy and needs to asap call her Manager, so he can handle it.\n\nAlso its a shitty move to not directly call the Manager for not giving the money back on something you deny, which isnt the customers fault.", "Not OP, but the manager/owner. OP doesn't have the authority to make an exception under any circumstances. It has to be the manager/owner, and technically, they're not required to make exceptions to policy. The manager/owner would be a major AH if they refused because morally it's wrong as it was not the customer's fault. If the manager/owner refused to make an exception and the customer wanted to, they could take the salon owner to small claims court and would probably win.\n\nBut my whole point is that OP has no say in whether or not an exception is made. All OP can do is go by the policy. Even if OP desperately wanted to refund it, if the manager/owner said \"No, it's non-refundable, no refunds, no exceptions,\" then OP wouldn't be allowed to give them a refund.", ">I mean the mother asked if that was okay for OP to handle at which point that flags up the how long question which no one chose to ask. \n\nThe way you put it, it's like it's 100% on other people to try and get that information out of the mother, as if she could never think to offer that information herself.", "That's not how barber shops or salons work as in your scenario a computer fixed in a vehicle requires a specific skill someone at the shop may not have where as OP has the skill yet is unable. If OP is booking women's cut appointments and is unable to do a specific length it is up to OP to inform potential clients BEFORE an appointment is made, whether OP needs to tell the receptionist to inform potential clients of this prior or if she needs to personally contact them it is OPs responsibility.\n\nMid back length and lower back length takes no different skill it's just shittier positions. Also why do they not have rising chairs?", "\ud83d\ude01", "So also by your logic OP does not have the authority to say no to the customer when they ask for a refund, they should have immediately involved a manager. \n\nI find it hard to respond to your comment because I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re purposely being dense or have just never worked for a company that provides goods/services to customers. There\u2019s no blanket policy that would allow a service provider to take money from a customer and not provide the service. It\u2019s not a morality issue, it\u2019s theft which is illegal. I really don\u2019t understand what argument you are trying to make.", "The mother goes to this salon with her daughter with a different stylist. That stylist was unavailable. It\u2019s not unreasonable that the mother would expect the salon to have this information already, and she did ask if OP can handle long hair. \n\nThis is especially true if the receptionist acted familiar or otherwise recognized the mother/daughter. \u201cOh hey, so and so, yeah your regular stylist is out of town but OP can do it\u201d! Of course, we have no way of knowing how the call with the receptionist went, but OP certainly gives the impression this client is already known to the salon."]}
