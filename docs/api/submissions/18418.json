I had mum book her daughter in for a trim and colour with me, I\u2019m not their usual stylist. The stylist they usually go to is on holiday and I was recommended to them by a friend. When the mum booked the trim and colour in, she specified that her daughter had long hair and asked if that was ok for me to handle. The receptionist said yes because I have a lot of clients with waist length hair. Waist length is usually the longest hair I will cut, I have never had a client with hair longer than this. Due to issues with my knee, I can\u2019t kneel down for long. I\u2019m awaiting surgery.\r  \n\r  \nWhen they turned up for the appointment, the daughter had her hair up in a bun so I couldn\u2019t see the full length of her hair. The mum thanked me for being able to fit her daughter in, she said that when their usual stylist isn\u2019t available, it can be difficult to get her daughter an appointment due to her hair length. When the daughter sat in my chair, I asked her to take her hair down so that I could brush through it before we started her ombre colour. When she took her hair down, I noticed it was much longer than I expected. I asked her how long her hair was, and she said it was knee length. She brushed her hair back so that it was all going down the back of the chair and it was well past the length I was comfortable cutting at. I would have had to kneel down the colour and cut her hair. I waved the mum over as I told the daughter to take off the gown. I apologised to the mum and told her that I would not be able to cut her daughter\u2019s hair due to it\u2019s length. I explained that it was too long for me to cut as I could not kneel down to cut her hair. \r  \nUnderstandably, the mum was upset that I was refusing to cut her daughter\u2019s hair. She demanded the booking fee back. I informed her that the \u00a350 booking fee was non-refundable, and she would have been told this at time of booking. She then demanded to speak to the manager of the salon, I told her that I would get her the owner. \r  \n\r  \nThe owner of the salon did refund her the money. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t have taken the booking if I couldn\u2019t cut hair that long. I told her that the length had never been specified to me, the receptionist was just told long and that long hair in our area is usually no longer than waist length. She knows I can\u2019t kneel without being in pain. The mum has since been writing on the Facebook page of the salon, complaining that I refused to cut her daughter\u2019s hair because can\u2019t actually cut long hair. I feel bad that the mum is upset about this, but at the same time it was never specified how long her daughter\u2019s hair actually was.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for refusing to cut extremely long hair?", "created_utc": 1685311761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ucn7i/aita_for_refusing_to_cut_a_clients_extremely_long/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How many people have HAIR TO THEIR KNEES?", "The demand came after she said no", "Out of the general population?

OP knows she can't cut super long hair,  they know the7r df", "Because that\u2019s the policy. If the person has an issue with the policy, they request a manager.", "Exactly. I'm confused where all these \"AH because you refused to refund\" are coming from. It's not like OP insisted on not refunding (based on the post). It seems like she mentioned it once, maybe twice, that it's the salon's policy, and as soon as the mom asked for the manager, OP got the manager. It'd be different if OP was insistent on not refunding or getting the manager. I'd even consider OP the AH if they said something like \"well the manager isn't going to refund based on policy\" but that didn't happen, again according to the post.\n\nOP literally did her job following salon policy, according to the post. I'm going with NTA because what else could OP have done? And the mom complaining on the salon's page about it makes the mom a bit of an AH. There's a huge difference between \"long hair\" and \"knee length.\" I mean, yeah technically knee length is long, but I don't think anyone will hear long hair and think knee length. The mom should've mentioned this, especially since it's hard to find someone specifically because of her daughter's hair length.", "You don't get nuance do you? It was the stylists fault the appointment could not proceed. Instead of sticking to a policy that is there due to clients not showing up she should have immediately deferred to the manager to ensure the customer was taken care of.", "If the worker can tell the policy is wrong (which, in this case, it absolutely was) they can take some initiative and get the manager involved in the first place. Trying to shut down the customer was an AH move.", "It wasn\u2019t solely the stylists\u2019 fault. The owner/manager knew of OP\u2019s disability. The length of the customer\u2019s hair wasn\u2019t specified, the receptionist didn\u2019t ask before booking, and the mom didn\u2019t tell despite previously having trouble finding salons that cut that length."]}
