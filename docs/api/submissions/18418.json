I had mum book her daughter in for a trim and colour with me, I\u2019m not their usual stylist. The stylist they usually go to is on holiday and I was recommended to them by a friend. When the mum booked the trim and colour in, she specified that her daughter had long hair and asked if that was ok for me to handle. The receptionist said yes because I have a lot of clients with waist length hair. Waist length is usually the longest hair I will cut, I have never had a client with hair longer than this. Due to issues with my knee, I can\u2019t kneel down for long. I\u2019m awaiting surgery.\r  \n\r  \nWhen they turned up for the appointment, the daughter had her hair up in a bun so I couldn\u2019t see the full length of her hair. The mum thanked me for being able to fit her daughter in, she said that when their usual stylist isn\u2019t available, it can be difficult to get her daughter an appointment due to her hair length. When the daughter sat in my chair, I asked her to take her hair down so that I could brush through it before we started her ombre colour. When she took her hair down, I noticed it was much longer than I expected. I asked her how long her hair was, and she said it was knee length. She brushed her hair back so that it was all going down the back of the chair and it was well past the length I was comfortable cutting at. I would have had to kneel down the colour and cut her hair. I waved the mum over as I told the daughter to take off the gown. I apologised to the mum and told her that I would not be able to cut her daughter\u2019s hair due to it\u2019s length. I explained that it was too long for me to cut as I could not kneel down to cut her hair. \r  \nUnderstandably, the mum was upset that I was refusing to cut her daughter\u2019s hair. She demanded the booking fee back. I informed her that the \u00a350 booking fee was non-refundable, and she would have been told this at time of booking. She then demanded to speak to the manager of the salon, I told her that I would get her the owner. \r  \n\r  \nThe owner of the salon did refund her the money. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t have taken the booking if I couldn\u2019t cut hair that long. I told her that the length had never been specified to me, the receptionist was just told long and that long hair in our area is usually no longer than waist length. She knows I can\u2019t kneel without being in pain. The mum has since been writing on the Facebook page of the salon, complaining that I refused to cut her daughter\u2019s hair because can\u2019t actually cut long hair. I feel bad that the mum is upset about this, but at the same time it was never specified how long her daughter\u2019s hair actually was.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for refusing to cut extremely long hair?", "created_utc": 1685311761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ucn7i/aita_for_refusing_to_cut_a_clients_extremely_long/", "score": 1299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like OP insisted on not refunding (based on the post). It seems like she mentioned it once, maybe twice, that it's the salon's policy, and as soon as the mom asked for the manager, OP got the manager. It'd be different if OP was insistent on not refunding or getting the manager. I'd even consider OP the AH if they said something like \"well the manager isn't going to refund based on policy\" but that didn't happen, again according to the post.\n\nOP literally did her job following salon policy, according to the post. I'm going with NTA because what else could OP have done? And the mom complaining on the salon's page about it makes the mom a bit of an AH. There's a huge difference between \"long hair\" and \"knee length.\" I mean, yeah technically knee length is long, but I don't think anyone will hear long hair and think knee length. The mom should've mentioned this, especially since it's hard to find someone specifically because of her daughter's hair length.", "You don't get nuance do you?

Not for when the staff can't do the job for personal reasons", "Customer service. There's two words there and it seems like you have little comprehension of the meaning of either.\n\nWhen you work customer service, you don't have to be a mindless drone. There is room for nuance - in areas where it's absolutely fair for the customer to get a refund that is against store policy, your first resort should be to put them in touch with the people who can rectify the issue.\n\nI have respect for people who aren't blatant idiots and little respect for those that are. I've also worked in the service industry and have never had issues refunding customers or breaking policy when shit didn't meet expectations.", "Just my two cents, it really depends on the company. In some places it is company policy to enforce the rules to the customer and if they ask for the manager, then they can get a refund. I worked at a party store where the cashier had to enforce the no return policy on certain items, but if the customer asks for supervisor or manager, then we have to accept the return. It's a way to keep the money, but if the customer pushes enough they'll get their way. Not saying the client here shouldn't have gotten the refund, she should have due to miscommunications. Just saying that some places do act like this.", "Dude, company policy exists for standard cases, not fringe cases like this. People need to use their fucking brains from time to time.", "It\u2019s so insane how people just don\u2019t fucking think and don\u2019t even see it as a problem", "This is definitely OP's alt account", "Wow you\u2019re really willing to die on this hill, aren\u2019t you? Adult woman with \u201creal job\u201d here, hi. Uhhh have you lost your mind? I think the real question is have YOU ever had a real job? Because who on earth would look at a client and say \u201csorry I couldn\u2019t render services to you on account that I AM THE ONE with an issue and cannot complete the task I\u2019m paid to do but >oops, sorry< POLICY.\u201d \n\nOP IF ANYTHING, should have said \u201cI totally understand, let me get my boss to see what we can do.\u201d The mother is complaining publicly based upon the way OP handled it on her end. Yes, the owner refunded them because that\u2019s the correct way to handle something like this."]}
