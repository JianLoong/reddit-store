I study and work here, and Katie has also recently enrolled in a program, so living together is the most affordable arrangement. I would say that we've always had a pretty strong relationship, and as such I've never really felt the need to be very protective over my her until recently.\n\nA few weeks ago, I came across something that's been bothering me a bit. My friend, Jack (M24), has been part of my friends group for about two years now and we've grown closer over the past year. He's a pretty nice guy, but I can't ignore the fact that Jack has a history of quickly jumping from one relationship to another and has a reputation for cheating on his partners. Simply put, he's a womanizer.\n\nThe issue began when Katie mentioned that she and Jack were following each other on Instagram and had been chatting. I felt pretty uncomfortable with this, as I'm fully aware of Jack's past. At the time, I tried telling her a bit about Jack's history, but she brushed it off, claiming she isn't interested in anything like that.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and I spotted Katie being dropped off in front of our apartment complex by  Jack. I was surprised by this, as neither of them told me anything about seeing each other, so I decided to confronted her about it. Needless to say, we ended up in a heated argument.\n\nI told her about my concerns, telling her that Jack is a text book player and not someone she should get involved with. I also reminded her that she's here to focus on finishing her degree and not to date someone with a history like Jack's. But of course Katie defended him, saying that people can change, and he didn't seem that way to her. She then accused me of being too controlling and not giving Jack a chance.\n\nI was annoyed by this, so I told her that if she continued like this, I would be letting our parents know about this. She became more furious by this and yelled at me before going into her room.\n\nThe next day (5 days ago), I saw Jack and told him that I didn't want him communicating with my sister. Jack played dumb at first, but then agreed to my request, saying he'd respect my boundaries.\n\nSince then, Katie has been complaining to her friends that Jack doesn't contact her as much as he used to, and she's convinced that I must be involved somehow. When she asked me about Jack, I've been largely avoided answering her accusations.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: For some more context, Katie has always indicated she wants a serious relationship. I know that in the past, Jack has pretended to offer serious relationships, but almost always ended up ghosting the girl.", "created_utc": 1690131472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157jy57/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_relationship/", "score": 453, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This guy is your friend that she decided to date AND he's only interested in sex until he finds a new toy. Quite frankly, your sister's choice to date this guy sucks on her part because if she really does only want something casual, who chooses to do that with their sibling's friend? Plus, this so called friend chose to play his games with your sister. The proof being that you spoke to him about it NOT being cool, and he says fine and moves on without a fight. Your sister will get over it and will likely thank you once she gets the presence of mind to meet a nice guy (which she clearly wants by her assertions that your friend can change). But dump the friend. That he would have the audacity to cross that line shows he doesn't value your sister OR your friendship. \n\nTo the people saying it's her right to be smashed and tossed aside, I feel bad for your family members.

What OP did was take away is sister's autonomy.  She is a grown ass woman who can make her own choices.  Protecting his sister would be if he told her about Jack once.  Once he did that, he's done his job.  The rest is up to her to decide.  Anything beyond that is creepy, controlling behavior on OP's part.", "So taking away a grown woman's autonomy is an ok thing to do?  Because that's exactly what OP did.  Had he told her once about Jack and then let her make her own choices (which is what you should do when you're an adult), then I would say that OP wasn't in the wrong.

She's not a toddler, she's an adult who is capable of making her own choices.  You want to know what you SHOULD have done?  You should have told her about him once, then let her decide what to do.  Maybe it would have played out like you predict, but maybe it wouldn't have.  And then, if it did, you comfort her (without telling her, \"I told you so\"), and hope that she makes a better choice next time.  But, the way you did it, you took away her autonomy.  And that makes you 100 times worse than Jack.", "Yes. Yes you are supposed to ignore it. You warned her, and if you don\u2019t feel like buying her ice cream and letting her cry on your shoulder if you\u2019re right, that\u2018s okay.

Will she cry when he reveals himself to be a player? Yes. Then you comfort her without judgment. Help her heal. Cut off Jack.

Shit happens. \n\nYou wanting to tell mommy and daddy on her is so freaking juvenile that it has you looking like a child and not an adult. \n\nYou getting in between them also makes you look like a child. You are an asshole who has control issues who thinks of her as just a kid still. She\u2019s an adult. Let her date who she wants.

If you don't want to be there for her, that is an ok choice.  But what you don't get to do (if you want to be a decent human being and a good brother anyway), is make choices for your adult sister.  What if all she wanted was a short term fuck buddy?  Then they would be perfect for each other for now.  Did you even bother to ask Katie what she was looking for right now?", "You don't know that for sure.  And, there is a huge difference between her being sad, but healing, moving on, and learning from the experience and her mental health being harmed.  You're just latching onto this to try to give yourself another excuse.  And now she's sad anyway, but this time, it's because of you.", "Guess what? That\u2019s not your choice to make \ud83d\ude43", "While I agree what OP did was an AH move, Jack did prove his point by distancing himself from Katie. If he genuinely liked her and was looking for a serious relationship, he would keep seeing her. Instead he dropped her like he drops all the other women he dates because to him, women are disposable objects.", "That obviously couldn't happen. No woman could ever be interested in just sex since everyone knows that women don't enjoy it as much as men. /s\n\nSeems to me like OP is controlling as fuck and just doesn't like the idea of his sister having sex, and especially if it's with someone he knows. What he doesn't realize is that she's an adult and is free to fuck whomever and however many people she wants.", "If she's not worth the hassle of even communicating that he liked her, then he wasn't serious about her.\n\nI give OP the credit of knowing his sister better than you do.\n\nYeah, who has ever heard of family members looking out for each other... Let me guess, you're American, the land of kicking out your kids at 18", "Ultimately he didn't decide what's best for her. He warned her and then asked his friend to drop her.\n\nIf his friend would have saw her as anything serious he would have communicated that instead of instantly dropping her.\n\nAll OP did was communicate, he didn't force anyone to do anything.\n\nNothing weird about a brother looking out for his sister...
