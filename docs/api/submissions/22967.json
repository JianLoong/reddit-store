I study and work here, and Katie has also recently enrolled in a program, so living together is the most affordable arrangement. I would say that we've always had a pretty strong relationship, and as such I've never really felt the need to be very protective over my her until recently.\n\nA few weeks ago, I came across something that's been bothering me a bit. My friend, Jack (M24), has been part of my friends group for about two years now and we've grown closer over the past year. He's a pretty nice guy, but I can't ignore the fact that Jack has a history of quickly jumping from one relationship to another and has a reputation for cheating on his partners. Simply put, he's a womanizer.\n\nThe issue began when Katie mentioned that she and Jack were following each other on Instagram and had been chatting. I felt pretty uncomfortable with this, as I'm fully aware of Jack's past. At the time, I tried telling her a bit about Jack's history, but she brushed it off, claiming she isn't interested in anything like that.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and I spotted Katie being dropped off in front of our apartment complex by  Jack. I was surprised by this, as neither of them told me anything about seeing each other, so I decided to confronted her about it. Needless to say, we ended up in a heated argument.\n\nI told her about my concerns, telling her that Jack is a text book player and not someone she should get involved with. I also reminded her that she's here to focus on finishing her degree and not to date someone with a history like Jack's. But of course Katie defended him, saying that people can change, and he didn't seem that way to her. She then accused me of being too controlling and not giving Jack a chance.\n\nI was annoyed by this, so I told her that if she continued like this, I would be letting our parents know about this. She became more furious by this and yelled at me before going into her room.\n\nThe next day (5 days ago), I saw Jack and told him that I didn't want him communicating with my sister. Jack played dumb at first, but then agreed to my request, saying he'd respect my boundaries.\n\nSince then, Katie has been complaining to her friends that Jack doesn't contact her as much as he used to, and she's convinced that I must be involved somehow. When she asked me about Jack, I've been largely avoided answering her accusations.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: For some more context, Katie has always indicated she wants a serious relationship. I know that in the past, Jack has pretended to offer serious relationships, but almost always ended up ghosting the girl.", "created_utc": 1690131472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157jy57/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_relationship/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This guy is your friend that she decided to date AND he's only interested in sex until he finds a new toy. Quite frankly, your sister's choice to date this guy sucks on her part because if she really does only want something casual, who chooses to do that with their sibling's friend? Plus, this so called friend chose to play his games with your sister. The proof being that you spoke to him about it NOT being cool, and he says fine and moves on without a fight. Your sister will get over it and will likely thank you once she gets the presence of mind to meet a nice guy (which she clearly wants by her assertions that your friend can change). But dump the friend. That he would have the audacity to cross that line shows he doesn't value your sister OR your friendship. \n\nTo the people saying it's her right to be smashed and tossed aside, I feel bad for your family members.

Maybe it would have played out like you predict, but maybe it wouldn't have.  And then, if it did, you comfort her (without telling her, \"I told you so\"), and hope that she makes a better choice next time.  But, the way you did it, you took away her autonomy.  And that makes you 100 times worse than Jack.", "Yes. Yes you are supposed to ignore it.

Did you even bother to ask Katie what she was looking for right now?", "You don't know that for sure.  And, there is a huge difference between her being sad, but healing, moving on, and learning from the experience and her mental health being harmed.

Instead he dropped her like he drops all the other women he dates because to him, women are disposable objects.", "That obviously couldn't happen. No woman could ever be interested in just sex since everyone knows that women don't enjoy it as much as men. /s\n\nSeems to me like OP is controlling as fuck and just doesn't like the idea of his sister having sex, and especially if it's with someone he knows. What he doesn't realize is that she's an adult and is free to fuck whomever and however many people she wants.", "If she's not worth the hassle of even communicating that he liked her, then he wasn't serious about her.\n\nI give OP the credit of knowing his sister better than you do.\n\nYeah, who has ever heard of family members looking out for each other... Let me guess, you're American, the land of kicking out your kids at 18", "Ultimately he didn't decide what's best for her. He warned her and then asked his friend to drop her.\n\nIf his friend would have saw her as anything serious he would have communicated that instead of instantly dropping her.\n\nAll OP did was communicate, he didn't force anyone to do anything.\n\nNothing weird about a brother looking out for his sister... It's you guys that are the weirdos.\n\nNow if Jack would have said that he was serious about Katie, and OP would have still tried to mess up the relationship that would be a problem.", "Must be nice having the all the right answers", "If Jack had good intentions towards Katie, he wouldn\u2019t have stopped communicating with her just because OP asked him to. As everyone here has pointed out Jack and Katie are adults who weren\u2019t doing anything wrong by dating each other. If Jack knew he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, he would have just told OP that while he respects his feelings, he likes his sister too much to not give this relationship a chance. Instead he just walked away without offering Katie the courtesy of an explanation because to him, she\u2019s just another number in his phone. That\u2019s how players operate.", "He just decided they weren't friends anymore because of the responses he's getting in this post. I'll bet he hasn't even told Jack they aren't friends anymore!  I think he genuinely expected to be hailed as a hero for stepping in and controlling his sister's life", "Probably because of the hate he's getting on here lol", "She's always indicated and even plainly said that she looks for serious relationships. I have no doubt that Jack has been pretending to offer that.", "Oh I'm in no way defending Jack or saying he's not an AH.  He definitely sounds like a jerk.  But that in no way excuses OP's actions.", "Exactly. He knows it bc he is hiding the fact he spoke to this dude from her. He's reading as \"I was right, his intentions aren't pure\" \u2014 when actually it's a non-starter, bc even if dude bro vaguely liked this girl...she's not so special as to try to challenge her brother who has self-appointed himself as her chastity belt. Like...it's very obvious.", "Let me guess, you're from a machismo country with outdated ideas about gender", "Then, yet again, you let it play out.  You don't make the decision for her!  What is so difficult for your to understand about that?  You are a terrible brother.", "This has nothing to do with gender, but looking out for your family. \n\nYour judgement was off, while the population is mixed here, me and wife make things as equal as possible (the only standouts are pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding which I am physically unable to do).", "Jack made the decision. His sister doesn\u2019t even know OP talked to Jack.", "Ok...that's fine...there's something incredibly old-fashioned about a brother involving himself in his sister's relationships. \"Relationship\" could be anything from a one-night-stand to a marriage proposal. The brother is overstepping his brotherly role, going behind an adult woman's back and chasing off men he deems unacceptable. That's NOT ok, and if you think so you aren't as progressive as you think you are. His gender is relevant because he is a walking caricature of big strong brother dude protecting baby sister. Gender confirming- patriarchy bullshit.", "Jack made the decision because OP meddled in his sister's business.  Don't get me wrong, Jack sounds like a jerk, but that doesn't excuse OP's actions.  He took his sister's autonomy away.  And, OP knows that what he did was wrong.  If he thought what he did was right, he would have come clean to his sister when she asked him."]}
