{"id": 28740, "submission_id": "175xt2g", "title": "AITA for not staying home for the night with my daughter while my wife goes out with friends?", "selftext": "**Background:** My wife rarely goes out with friends (~6 times/year) and has never been very social and prefers spending time with me. I am more social, but that has declined as we have focused on our family (we have a 2 year old daughter), and I spend time with the same 3 friends once/week for games night (sometimes in person, sometimes online). I have another 3 friends that I see only once every 2 months, also for games night. If I go out my wife will tend to our daughter (I often still help with dinner/bed time, but sometimes leave earlier than this). Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time). I always offer for my wife sleep in the next day, or something similar in exchange for me going out so that It's not a one-sided thing.\n\n**Scenario:** My wife made plans to spend an evening this weekend out with friends, she would be out from 6pm until late. After she made those plans, I was invited to my friends birthday thing with my \"second\" friend group, if I went I would be gone from 5pm until late. Last time I saw them was exactly one month ago. I brought this plan up with my wife as I wanted to make arrangements for a family member to take our daughter for the evening. She was irritated by this, and argued that I should stay home. I have since spoken with a family member who is happy to take our daughter at 5pm and have her stay the night and I have communicated this to my wife.\n\nI made it clear that this will not affect her plans at all, I will be responsible for dropoff and pickup of our daughter, and will not ask anything of my wife because I understand that it is rare for her to have a night out like this and so I don't want her to change her plans at all. She still thinks that I should stay home.\n\n**Her arguments:**\n\n- She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her\n- She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them\n\n**My arguments:**\n\n- I am covering for her as she does not have to change her plans and doesn't have to do anything for our daughter\n- This family member loves watching our daughter, and my wife is often quick to agree to leave our daughter there for sleepovers plenty of other evenings out of convenience (eg: we will be there for dinner and put our daughter to sleep there so we can visit longer, then we will leave her there for the night) so I don't see why this time its too much to ask\n\nI feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer. \"Punishment\" feels too strong of a word, I don't think there is any major resentment behind this or anything, I just don't know how else to describe the feeling.\n\nSo, AITA here for making plans to go out the same night my wife also already had plans to go out, even though I am covering all arrangements for our daughter for the evening?", "created_utc": 1697083335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175xt2g/aita_for_not_staying_home_for_the_night_with_my/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This weekend she has plans to go out with friends, having me stay home with our daughter. I also would like to make plans to go out, which would mean making arrangements for family to watch our daughter for the night.

She isn\u2019t necessarily going to worry all night, but she will be aware that your daughter is out of the house. She\u2019s going to mentally check in - now they are driving over, now she\u2019s likely settling down, now you are picking her up, time for bed again. \n\nEvery time she mentally check in she exerts a little effort. Maybe she glances out the window to check the weather is good for driving. Maybe she checks her watch or phone to see if you called. However, even the energy of simply having a thought adds up.\n\nIf your wife is like many parents I know, especially the main caregivers, she is always alert. She\u2019s always on. \n\nYou being home with your daughter doesn\u2019t turn that off but it does lesson the amount that it happens. The mental load of knowing your child is as safe as possible with their other parent is different from knowing they are driving around and at another house.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how safe it is - travel needs more attention than staying home.\n\nYou get to go out. You get mental breaks from parenthood. She doesn\u2019t get the same breaks. She\u2019s asking for one now.\n\nYou need to decide - does it really matter who\u2019s right here? Your wife is unhappy. This is rare occurrence for her that means a lot and you see your friends all the time. Even if you think my reasoning is completely irrelevant, is this birthday party *really* worth it?", "I was on the fence until you said that parenting your kid was 'punishment'\n\nDude. So much the AH", "Look, YTA either way but what I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention is that you said you would be responsible for pick up and drop off. Sir, your daughter is two years old, picking her up after her bedtime is disruptive to her schedule and quite frankly (as a mother to three toddlers) this will make her cranky and want her mother. Not only that, I\u2019m guessing your daughter wakes up fairly early so, are you planning to get up with her in the morning? \nLet\u2019s be real, you said your wife rarely goes out. Give her this. Stay home with your daughter and get up with her in the morning.", "How often do you spend 1-on-1 time with your daughter? I\u2019d be frustrated that you seem to put your friends first so often.", "YTA, she barely goes out. You go out all the time! Why can\u2019t you give your wife this one night and spend time with your toddler???", "Do you think the wife feels a small amount of guilt for asking for a babysitter. Even though my parents happily watch my kid. I still feel like I need to not ask too much as I don't want them to get burnt out and as the 'mother' I feel like I am somewhat slacking in my duties to have an overnight babysitter it's a strange feeling as even though they enjoy it I feel bad. Then when you were staying home to watch her that burden was on the other parent and not making her feel that layer of guilt. I hate wasting family babysitting nights as I don't like to do it too often so maybe she would rather you guys spend a child free night together and both enjoy it whereas this was meant to be one of her few outings and now she's wasted her babysitter night for awhile and it's just an extra one for you to add to your list if you get what I am saying.\n\nJust my opinion as someone in a very similar situation.", "YTA - Really inconsiderate here. Parenting your daughter isn\u2019t a punishment, it\u2019s what happens when you decide to have a child with your wife. You go out much more often than she does. Your wife understandably wants you to take care of her for one night, & i totally understand not trusting even family with her, if that\u2019s the issue. Most CSA comes from family.. disregarding any of that, you\u2019re her FATHER and she\u2019s your DAUGHTER. Why is it so hard for you to watch her? Shirking the responsibility onto someone else instead of watching her for one night is wrong. Your friends should understand you have a child and can\u2019t go out whenever. Grow up, she\u2019s your child too.", "Your wife goes out six times a year. That\u2019s six nights that you are required to be the Dad and it\u2019s too much for you?YTA and your wife may be questioning your commitment level.", ">I am covering for her\n\nNo, you're not. Someone else is. Get that straight. And you're missing out on some great memories with your kid that you can never replace.", "YTA. You see your friends *far* more frequently than your wife sees hers. You\u2019re long overdue to take more turns staying home. \n\nWhen\u2019s the last time you and your wife went out together? You should save your babysitting credits with your family members for date nights, not just nights where you go hang out with your friends by yourself like usual. \n\nThe fact that you think it\u2019s a punishment to stay at home with your own child while your wife has an extremely rare night out is really telling. Stay home with the kid, apologize to your wife, and plan a date night soon where the family member can babysit.", "This is definitely not going the way OP planned. He genuinely thought there would be an echo chamber here", "YTA - you seriously can\u2019t stay home for one night?", "YTA\n\nYou calling parenting a punishment, make you the AH. \n\nYou guys having nights out is whatever, but parenting your child isn't a punishment.", "YTA. Daughter comes first.", "Based on the fact that you are disagreeing with every comment, you didn\u2019t come here with an open mind you came here looking for people to agree with you.  \n\nYou go out every week with your friends. Do you know how many parents do that who have a toddler? Few. Who is looking after your child during this time? Your wife. \n\nYou can justify it all you want to internet strangers but ultimately your wife did not want you to do this and you put seeing your friends above her wishes. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. It is a matter of commitment\u2014 to your wife, to your daughter, to your family unit. You aren\u2019t willing to miss one little social event to spend one-on-one time with your daughter, to give your wife peace of mind that your daughter is safe and sound at home in her own bed.", "You should be excited to spend the evening with your daughter solo. Make it a fun night with dad for her.", "YTA. You're pawning your daughter off because of what you want to do instead of being a dad (so much for focusing on family). Having your child in the hands of another person immediately creates stress for the (seemingly) more involved parent, the sitters, and the child.\n\nYou can miss one night with your friends.", "NTA. i just dont understand the down votes. Im with OP. why cant they both have a night out. The baby is with someone who has done this frequently before.", "So I think people have already made it clear yta here, but I want you to try to look at it this way to help you understand why. When you go out, it\u2019s not even a second thought to you that your wife is at home with your baby. You trust your wife with your daughter, I\u2019m sure you check in and communicate while you\u2019re out but you know you can comfortably enjoy your nights out knowing that your daughter is safe and well cared for by her mom. If you and your wife go out on a date night (when\u2019s the last time you did that btw just curious?) and a family member watches your baby for you, you\u2019re a little more conscious that someone else outside of her two main caregivers are watching her. You probably can\u2019t relax and let loose as much as you\u2019d really like to. Your wife simply wants the same respect, comfort, and convenience she provides to you when you go out. She doesn\u2019t want to worry about checking in with someone else while you two are out doing separate things. She wants to go out knowing her baby is safe at home with dad. \n\nAlso, any time you\u2019ve gone out have you ever offered to your wife to have a family member watch your baby so she could get some peace and relaxation time at home? Even if she\u2019s not going out, I think she would really appreciate the break from being alone with your daughter for once. \n\nI relate very much to this situation because it\u2019s extremely similar to my own. My husband is the social butterfly and i am the homebody. He goes out at least once a week sometimes more. When I want to go out, I either have to bring my daughter with me or ask someone to babysit her for me because he\u2019ll want to make plans on top of my plans. It\u2019s frustrating that he can come and go as he pleases but when I want to go somewhere he can\u2019t just be the one to sit at home for once. The things you\u2019ve said in your post parallel with a lot of excuses he\u2019s given me too. \n\nI hope this helps a bit to hear it from different angles.", "Just based on this, NTA. But you are quick to dismiss major resentment. Try to figure out what is really going on. Your wife is caring for your daughter alone once a week and you are never doing it? What does making it feel more even look like? A gym night? Another hobby? A few hours entirely alone when she can sit in a dark room and watch a movie with her favorite cocktail? Even if your wife is an introvert, she is still missing out on something from her pre-kid life by being primary parent and she still gets your support to replace that.", "YTA - can\u2019t even sacrifice one night for your wife to relax. You are very selfish.,", "Yta\n\nYou are not covering for HER but for yourself.   \n\nYou are a parent -act like one, not like a babysitter who nopes out for a school mixer.\n\nThis isn't essential or rare.", "Mate I don't know why you're being slammed so hard in these comments. \n\nYou both get to go out and the family member gets to see your daughter (which they love) \n\nUnless you've left out things you're NTA and the people here that aren't reading the entire post are out of line... it's not a zero sum game. \n\nYour wife is just concerned you're taking advantage of the family member too much... Is that the case? \n\nAnyway I hope you see this... I'm sure it'll be at the bottom \ud83e\udd23", "NTA", "YTA. \n\nYou are the asshole for the comment about parenting being punishment. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is an issue having a family member, watch your toddler so you can both go out. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue.", "NAH.\n\nI think your wife's reaction is born of resentment, rather than logic, but I have a lot of empathy for her in this situation. Your proposed solution makes perfect logical sense, but I suspect it provoked a strong emotional reaction from your wife due to some negative feelings that have been building up in her for a long time.\n\nShe sees you having lots of down time and having fun with your friends, and for whatever reason she is envious of that. Maybe she wishes she was more social, or had closer friends? Maybe she would like to have more time off to do hobbies on her own? Maybe she feels like your friends get more quality time with you than she does?\n\nWhatever the issue is, she clearly feels that your relationship is currently unbalanced in your favour. Rather than arguing over the specifics of this one particular fight, try talking to your wife about this issue more broadly. Let her know that her happiness is important to you, and you can tell that she's unhappy with how things are, and you want to hear from her about how she feels, and discuss potential changes that could be made to the current arrangements to make her feel better.\n\nAnd for the record, I see no reason why the solution needs to involve taking something away from you, but I do think it needs to involve giving something (time, space, whatever she needs) to your wife to help her feel happier. I think she also just needs to hear that her feelings are important to you, and that you're willing to make sacrifices for her (as she probably feels like she has been doing for you).", "You need to kindly ask her if she is irritated that you go out more frequently. Take it from me, you seem to just be starting out with your family, don't let resentment ride high because you're afraid to share your feelings for fear of a discussion. OR at least, you tell her that. Maybe that family member loves it, can't get enough of watching your child. Then you need to investigate where her head is at. It seems like you may need more social stimulation than her and it just now seems to be bugging her, if that even is the case.", "YTA. She rarely goes out and is always on mum duty. The occasion she has a chance to go out, you are still shirking your dad duty responsibilities and passing your daughter off to family members. You are also missing out on the chance for quality time where it's just you and her?Do you ever look after her by yourself?", "I'm going with NTA on this one. The kid is being taken care of by a family member who enjoys it. There's no reason you both can't go out and do your own things separately and still have fun.", "YTA.  You are being passive-aggressive as hell.  Yeah, she can go out but *so can you.*  That is what you are communicating to her.  And you know this.  Or else, you wouldn\u2019t perceive staying home to be a \u201cpunishment.\u201d\n\nYou are actually a massive asshole.", "YTA, you aren't showing your wife that your daughter is a priority to you over your friends. You scheduled things after she did, and did so unnecessarily, you spend time with friends all the time and regularly miss bed time. How do you think that will impact your relationship with your daughter? Also, parenting isn't a punishment in any way, you should be grateful for the opportunity to have some 1-on-1 time with your daughter  at bedtime.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is being cared for, and I think the \"punishment\" description is more spot-on than people are willing to admit. Wife wants you to have to stay home instead of going out like she does because she feels like it's a burden and wants to punish you with the same burden. She's going out to have fun, you're not allowed to go out and have fun, too, because she doesn't get to have fun when you otherwise go out!\n\nYou took responsibility and made arrangements. You are doing drop-off and pick-up. And you never told her she couldn't make alternate arrangements and go out on nights you go out with friends, or to even just have a quiet evening to herself. She acts like you're going out of your way to get out of parenting and avoid suffering like she does when your child will be asleep for the majority of your outing and will not be awake to care. A child you routinely participate in putting to bed, so it's not as if you never take responsibility for caring for your own child.\n\nShe seems to think this is a situation where one of you has to suffer while the other has a good time, and if one of you isn't suffering the same amount, it's unfair to the other person.", "YTA.\n\nBoy do I despise men that project their mommy issues on their wifes. What on earth feels so *punishing* to you? Spending time with your daughter, while your wife gets a fucking break for once? The fact that the whole house doesn't cater to your egocentrical thinking? You sound like a little boy whining to his mom right now and your wife will possibly (i'd say almost guaranteed) build resentment towards *that*. Your whole attitude towards \"but she gets to sleep in\", \"but she still gets to go\". Man, do you need me te spell it out for you?\n\nYour *pregnant* wife wants an evening out which she, from the sounds of it, barely has anyways. She is unhappy with the idea of a family member watching her kid. Why question her motives and pushing your agenda after she even told you *why*. What is possibly so god damn important at your \"bro's\" that you would risk your wife's once in a blue moon peaceful evening for, *after* SHE already made plans. It is not like you don't see them at all, you are even aware you see them enough weekly, with her at home, to the point where you \"think\" there is no resentment but you're not sure. This gives me the impression you are very aware of your egocentrical thinking. Even down to feeling entitled to plop your 2 year old kid at a family member whenever you feel like.\n\nAct like an adult male, give your wife a damn break, care for your daughter that evening and have whatever petty party on your own that you need to have. But let your wife have one evening. You are going out weekly ffs. Also, are you as much of an attentive father that you think you are? You seem to think that it's not worth it for you to take care of her because it is \"just dinner and to bed\". What? There are a million ways to wonderfully bond with your daughter during the \"mundane\". Seems you have a perfect evening to learn about those.", "YTA", "YTA. Your wife asked you to watch your daughter. As soon as a better option came up, you bailed. It's all well and good that you've arranged alternative care, but you've shown your wife you can not be relied on when asked.", "Nta. Kid is being looked after anyway", "What is up with all the YTA's? \n\nThis is clearly a care of NAH. It's one of those situations where one of them plans out the evening in their head and then the other one makes different plans. Both plans are fine, but when your partners plan differs from yours that sometimes throws you off. She had this vision of the evening. He changed the vision. I would probably be upset about that too, simply because \"arggghhh change\". And it would take me a while to be okay with the sudden change. Some people just don't handle change as well as we like to think we do. \n\nBut I don't for a second believe that your wife wants to punish you for going out more. If she's like me she actually appreciates the alone time with no one around to decompress. My one question is: how has she reacted in the past when OP's plans were cancelled? Because that will tell us if she just dislikes sudden change.", "In this house, OP >>> wife > daughter. YTA.", "NTA, I see everybody making such broad strokes about you never spending time with your daughter, about feeling like your wife wants to punish you by making you stay home with your daughter, about how impossibly important a single night of sleep is for your daughter and how you should just stick it up because you going out too it's taking something away from your wife. All these people are missing the forest for the trees.\nA single instance isn't indicative of any major patterns and it sounds like you have an excellent cover for your kid.

If she doesn't care to go out with friends, maybe take child out for a walk or to the park to give her free time alone at home, or watch her while your wife goes shopping, to the gym, or other out of home activities.\n\nMy husband was very social and I was a homebody. But he would take my daughter, starting when she was a toddler, for little adventures. Maybe they'd go for\"a hike\" in the woods, bringing a snack to have. Or take a drive to a park out of our usual area and he'd let her explore a new playground. Also he took her to eat breakfast out a couple times a month at a restaurant (usually a diner) on Saturday) so I could sleep in a bit.", "NTA , it's perfectly fine to make plans and get a babysitter. There's no good argument otherwise.", "Put your daughter up for adoption! Problem solved...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n**Background:** My wife rarely goes out with friends (~6 times/year) and has never been very social and prefers spending time with me. I am more social, but that has declined as we have focused on our family (we have a 2 year old daughter), and I spend time with the same 3 friends once/week for games night (sometimes in person, sometimes online). I have another 3 friends that I see only once every 2 months, also for games night. If I go out my wife will tend to our daughter (I often still help with dinner/bed time, but sometimes leave earlier than this). Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time). I always offer for my wife sleep in the next day, or something similar in exchange for me going out so that It's not a one-sided thing.\n\n**Scenario:** My wife made plans to spend an evening this weekend out with friends, she would be out from 6pm until late. After she made those plans, I was invited to my friends birthday thing with my \"second\" friend group, if I went I would be gone from 5pm until late. Last time I saw them was exactly one month ago. I brought this plan up with my wife as I wanted to make arrangements for a family member to take our daughter for the evening. She was irritated by this, and argued that I should stay home. I have since spoken with a family member who is happy to take our daughter at 5pm and have her stay the night and I have communicated this to my wife.\n\nI made it clear that this will not affect her plans at all, I will be responsible for dropoff and pickup of our daughter, and will not ask anything of my wife because I understand that it is rare for her to have a night out like this and so I don't want her to change her plans at all. She still thinks that I should stay home.\n\n**Her arguments:**\n\n- She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her\n- She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them\n\n**My arguments:**\n\n- I am covering for her as she does not have to change her plans and doesn't have to do anything for our daughter\n- This family member loves watching our daughter, and my wife is often quick to agree to leave our daughter there for sleepovers plenty of other evenings out of convenience (eg: we will be there for dinner and put our daughter to sleep there so we can visit longer, then we will leave her there for the night) so I don't see why this time its too much to ask\n\nI feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer. \"Punishment\" feels too strong of a word, I don't think there is any major resentment behind this or anything, I just don't know how else to describe the feeling.\n\nSo, AITA here for making plans to go out the same night my wife also already had plans to go out, even though I am covering all arrangements for our daughter for the evening?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She never goes out, you\u2019re out all the time. You saw them a month ago, I\u2019m lucky if I see my friends twice a year. Grow up. Realise that you aren\u2019t willing to put yourself second even for one night and reflect on that. Her going out and knowing that her family is safe at home waiting for her when she comes back will allow her to fully switch off and have fun.

Why are there so many YTA comments?\n\nFirst off, It's not like OP is going for casual golfing or a casual meet up with his friends at the bar. A friend invited him to a birthday party. \n\nSecondly, OP not only made proper arrangements for their daughter to be taken care of by a family member. He ensured that his wife wouldn't need to do anything.\n\nMeanwhile, OP's wife's arguments are extremely weak.\n\n>She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her\n\nOP IS covering for her by ensuring that she is able to go out for the night without having to take care of their daughter.\n\n>She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them\n\nIf she really feels this way, OP and his wife can do a little something to show their appreciation for this family member. OP asked, and the other party agreed to watch their daughter. There's no need to shy away from asking for help from a family member as long as they're ok with helping. So what's the issue?\n\nOP's wife is really just nitpicking at this point. NTA.", " NTA this is exactly what I would want. Your wife has plans, you\u2019ve been invited out as well and you want to go.

Your daughter will be taken care of go have fun", "YTA. Are you incapable of spending time alone with your child? \n\nYou have now effectively ruined your wife's evening.  If you go out, your wife will be spending her time thinking about how she inconvenienced a family member and will be worried about it. If you stay in, she will be thinking about you and how she ruined your night and will be worried that you are upset with her. It won't matter how much she is told everything is fine, in the back of her mind it won't be and she will end up cancelling. If you love her, don't let her. She needs time with her friends too.", "Ugghh. YTA and looking by the comments you're leaving in the thread, clearly not someone good at listening. The carefreeness one feels when one's child is in the safety of a parent is much much different than having it constantly at the back of your mind that there's a relative taking care of it instead, no matter how much the thought is pushed back. She's not asking too much from you, and if you can't even do this much, I wonder how long she'd want to stay married before she figures out how you don't prioritise her needs above yours.", "YTA. I stopped reading after you said that your wife rarely goes out.", "NTA. It\u2019s her choice she doesn\u2019t go out much. It\u2019s not like you both died when you had a kid?

People are saying the same thing again and again and you're completely unable to see someone else's point of view.", "It\u2019s a difference in where your priorities lie. Your wife rarely goes out or socialises with friends, but you do, therefore she covers for your social life a lot. You on the other hand don\u2019t have to cover for her that often. And even on one of those rare occasions where she has arranged a night out where you are responsible for the childcare, something comes up that you would prefer to do and you prioritise that over commitment you made to your wife. You are selfish. That is why your wife is angry with you. You sir, are a selfish asshole. You are showing how you think and that it\u2019s all a me, me, me with you.", "YTA she wants to go out for 1 of her 6 yearly outings and feel safe and secure that her daughter is home with her father. You are so selfish", "I\u2019m slightly baffled by all the Y T As. There seems to be a lot of assumptions on your parenting skills based on the fact that you like to be social. As someone who has raised three kids and liked to be social while doing so, please allow me to give you some advice. \n\nYou need to ask your wife what bothers her about your leaving your child with a family member. It might be that she doesn\u2019t want to impose on them. But it also might be that she doesn\u2019t truly relax unless she knows you\u2019re with your toddler. That\u2019s how I always felt. Anyone else could have called me any minute and tapped out, but my husband is my parenting partner and was completely capable of watching my girls. \n\nAlso, when my girls were little, my husband and I promised each other that we would never be martyrs. We would never agree to something we didn\u2019t want to do, just to hold it over someone else\u2019s head. We communicated openly and honestly when we needed time to ourselves, time with each other or time with our friends. And I believe there was a time or two that we got a sitter but did things separately. (And my kids turned out great!)\n\nGood luck! NAH", "NTA.  Your child gets to be looked after by someone who it sounds like is super happy to hang out with her, and who you can trust completely (given that you say you've left her with this person before).  You both get your night out.  It's lovely for kids to have a range of adults in their lives who love them, it's good for parents to be rounded individuals with lives outside of parenthood and it's a treat for the person looking after her to get hang-out time (I say this as someone with niblings).\n\nI think it's worth further exploring with your wife why she feels like this - there are some interested comments about emotional labour and resentment - but you can acknowledge, explore and address her feelings without necessarily indulging the outcome of them.  Does she need encouraging to do more socialising on her own?  Do you guys need to do more together (either as a two or as a three)?  Does she just need to hear from the babysitter (apologies, I don't know who it is so don't have a better word) that this is actually something they'd enjoy too?", "NTA, and I say this as the less sociable spouse who often stays home with the kids. If there is an occasion where we both have plans, we also go to a family member to take the kids overnight. This works better for everyone because the kids have fun with their family, and the adults get to have a fun night without worrying about what time we get home, or being woken up early by the children so there\u2019s a bonus lie in too.\n\nI think you\u2019re right, your wife is frustrated that you\u2019re out more than her and thinks it\u2019s unfair. I understand her feelings, so maybe this is more a NAH, but maybe offer to make it up to her by suggesting a girls weekend or similar where you *will* stay home with the toddler.", "You spent the time writing all this when you are obviously the TAH. You wife doesn\u2019t go out a lot, one night she does you want to go out as well so that she will be feeling guilty and anxious all night about leaving her 2yo.

I think you and her being able to go out on the same night seperately while a family member looks after them is a good solution.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have plans you would have looked after your daughter right? I don\u2019t see a problem here. \n\nThe only potential problem I sense here is your wife probably feels like she gives a lot in looking after the baby especially since she doesn\u2019t go out a lot - going out 6 times a year is equivalent to going out once every 2 months. She doesn\u2019t have an outlet to release her stress. I would suggest once every month you offer something nice to her eg a 2 hour massage voucher where she and or friend relaxes while you look after the baby.", "Bruh just look after your daughter you butthole", "Honestly, NTA. Everyone is arguing that \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just stay home\u201d, but I don\u2019t really understand why this one specific day it\u2019s so important for him to stay home.", "Yta. \n\n>I feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer.\n\nYou think it's a punishment to stay at home with your child?

No it shouldn't he has made sure childcare is taken care of. If she chooses to mentally check in all the time and have an issue and be stressed that seems like her fault at that point. The child is left with a trusted family member so they can both enjoy their night out.", "I love spending time with my daughter. The \"punishment\" I am referring to would be not being able to attend a friends birthday. And as I said in the post, \"punishment\" is a strong term and not really the right word for it. Keep in mind that there would be very little time actually spent with my daughter. If I stayed home, all I would do is make dinner and then put her to bed.", "For additional context, a very common routine of ours is spending dinner/evening at this exact family member's house, putting our daughter to sleep, and then waking her up later to bring her home for the rest of the night. It does not make her cranky and does not affect her waking time in the morning the next day. This night in question would be no different if I were to pick her up at night. But as stated in the post this family member is happy to have her over night, with me picking her up in the morning.", "The friend time I spend is 90% of the time after my daughter's bed time. Her bed time is 7:30, and more often than not I will help with the bed time routine before leaving. All other spare time I spend with my family.", "This is a genuine question, is it unclear from my post that my wife would still have her night? I am willing to accept I could be in the wrong, I just see from replies that people seem to think I would not be letting my wife go out, when in reality we would both be going out.", "I think I do get what you are saying, but I think our situation is somewhat unique. The family member that would be watching her does so very often, and enthusiastically. And many times my wife will be the first one to agree with them to have our daughter stay the night there after we already were there for dinner (we are there once a week, every week, for dinner). This family is a couple who are empty nesters (one son moved out a few years ago).", "Trusting family, or worrying about CSA is 100% not a factor here. We spend tons of time with these family members, and they watch our daughter often. I do not consider spending time with my daughter as punishment. I love spending time with her, as a family we spend nearly all our spare time together. In this scenario if I stayed home the only time I would be spending with her would be dinner and bed time. The rest of the evening would not be spent with her.", "I am a dad much more than 6 nights a year.

We are very well-balanced when it comes to sharing childcare duties, and house chores, etc.", "No they're not.\n\nSomeone else is covering for HIM.", "My wife does not like going out that much. I do not think it is a punishment to spend time with my daughter. The \"punishment\" in this instance would be missing out on a friends birthday, and being home alone and bored while my daughter sleeps.", "I will agree I am somewhat surprised at the number of Y T A responses. But I did not come here looking for an echo chamber. I value the input from unbiased parties. It gives me a different perspective and something to reflect on. I am being argumentative where I genuinely think people are jumping to conclusions or making assumptions about things that are not included in my post.", "The \"punishment\" would be not being able to go to my friends birthday. I do not view spending time with my daughter as a punishment, I love spending time with her. In this instance staying home wouldn't even include spending all that much time with her, it would be dinner and then bed time, and not much else.", "Thank you for your perspective, it is helpful to hear from someone with a similar situation. I guess where I struggle is that there are many other times where we have been out together and our daughter's wellbeing staying with a family member does not seem to be an issue, or a worry that would make the night less enjoyable for my wife. But perhaps in those situations, since she is with me, it is worth it to her.", "Well said! I think there is something deeper here and its not that OP wants to go to a birthday party, it's that OP seemingly  (based on this post)  gets \"me time\" far more often than his wife. Time to yourself doesn't mean you have to go out, sounds like she needs a break more frequently and for dad to handle their daughter, rather than pawning her off on someone else so he can go do what he wants.", "I agree it is not essential or rare.

Why must one of use be home while our daughter sleeps when there is a family member (who our daughter loves spending time with) who is more than happy to have her over for a sleepover.", "I did not say that parenting is a punishment.

Speak to her and find out what's going on, sounds like she needs you to hear what she isn't quite saying directly. In my opinion I think it's more resentment that you're invited out all the time, this was her night to let loose and you're changing the plans so she might not be as comfortable (whether it's being uncontactable or too far away if your daughter needs you). Sometimes we have to make sacrifices in a relationship and this might be one of them. \n\nI also agree, NAH. Good luck speaking to your Wife.", "I am honestly here to get outside opinions and understand where I may be in the wrong.

I have not confirmed anything yet and my wife is not under the impression that I have. And sorry but \"regularly miss bedtime\" is just blatantly false. I have plans with friends once a week. So at the MOST I would theoretically miss 14% of bed times. However, I more often than not will do bed time before I leave to spend time with friends (probably close to 75% of the time that I go out I will still do bed time). So in reality I maybe miss 3% of bed times, and that is assuming that my weekly plans actually happen every week, but sometimes they are cancelled for one reason or another (more often than not that cancellation comes from my end due to prioritizing family matters over my plans with friends).", "Yeah I'm a little confused by the ytas in here. I cannot see how this inconveniences his wife at all, and seems to be an arrangement they're both comfortable with on other nights.

I was invited to an event, I brought it up with my wife along with plans for childcare, and she disagreed. The We didn't come to a conclusion before she went to bed.

Where did I say that I accepted the invitation??", "This family member is very giving, and I will admit that occasionally I have also felt that sometimes we ask too much. However every time we try to compensate them in any way it is declined. They go out of their way to spend time with our daughter. They are quite well off and only work part time, so it is hard to really offer them much that they can't already have. Whenever we have the opportunity to help them with anything, we jump on it. We even went so far as to offer to install in-ground irrigation for their front and back yard/garden (on our dime, and labor) as I have experience with that, they very very reluctantly agreed and then later eventually convinced us not to do that for them.", "Thank you for the advice, this is likely how I will approach the conversation tomorrow when we pick it up again.", "The man gets to hang out with friends every week on his own admission, that is so much more often than so many adults get to do\u2026\u2026 why can\u2019t he do for her what she does for him so routinely?", "You could play with her, read a few stories enjoy dinner with her.

But her anxiety during the night is likely going to increase by 100000%.\n\nIn any normal circumstance she\u2019s probably going to be nervous about leaving your daughter because she doesn\u2019t do that a lot. On top of that she\u2019s pregnant and hormonal, which will likely cause her to be much more anxious and scared.\n\nBut it\u2019s okay, because she knows her daughter is in safe hands with her beloved husband. \n\nExcept now she\u2019s not. Last minute plan change and now she\u2019s going to be nervous about her daughter\u2019s wellbeing all night rather than actually having a nice time out.

You would NOT be spending the time at this person\u2019s house WHEN your daughter falls asleep. Since you will be dropping her off at 5:00 and then the hope is that she\u2019d fall asleep without you there at 7:30. Often times 2-year old can fall asleep easily if a parent is there, as you have done in the past, but if the parent is not there, the child may get anxious and not be able to sleep. YOU are not putting her to sleep, your family member is. 2 year olds can be pretty fussy about this. \n\nThis may cause your wife to worry during her night out, instead of enjoying her night out as she would if your daughter was home with you.

Your wife gets plenty of time to bond with her alone. You were asking why it matters if you go out since your wife still can/you have kid coverage.

Your attitude gives the impression that going out to your friends is more important than your daughter and your wife having a nice night out.\n\nDoesn't matter that your family member likes looking after your daughter and that you trust them, it's perception that's important and you are showing her that your enjoyment is more important than her time out and your daughters welfare.", "It\u2019s clear that she would still have her night, what\u2019s not clear is why can\u2019t you stay home with your child knowing she had plans prior to the plans you made.

Those hobbies that maybe she's interested in?", "So you often socialise and go out with your friends your wife rarely goes out. You get invited to a last second birthday party. You know of your wife's plans you know she often covers for you. So you understand why she thinks you should cover for her. You don't want to stay with daughter because it would only be dinner and bedtime. What if the evening you go out to your friends party is one of her fussy nights? You think that is reasonable no it's not. Your friend would/should probably understand that as a parent you can't always go to everything.

It is unfair and you know it, you just think dumping the kid on family makes it OK. Family didn't fuck and have this kid and the next, you did, and they will NOT keep picking up YOUR slack, which will mean your wife gets shafted AGAIN. If you use up all your family's good will, YOUR WIFE will bear the fallout, you get that, right?\n\nBut hey, as long as you get to escape every week, trapping your wife in the house with the child for that same period you get to escape, it's all good, right? Why should YOUR life change, right?\n\nYour wife is seeing she can't depend on you to have her back. Over time, this will eat away and rot the love she has for you. \n\nI hope your  friends are worth losing your family over!\n\nAnd you can't say you split childcare equally,  that is clearly untrue since you go out once a week and leave her alone.", "But it\u2019s these small instances that can fracture and break a marriage.

Also if I was your wife and saw you referring to spending time with our child as a punishment (no matter how you try to justify it mr. The punishment is not seeing my friends) I\u2019d be livid. It is not a punishment to not go out to a last minute birthday party. I believe the word you\u2019re looking for is disappointment.

You probably should not have had a child if you can\u2019t handle occasionally missing an adult social event. You probably should not have had a child if you think it\u2019s too boring to be at home with her while she sleeps. But, since it\u2019s too late and you already do have a kid, it\u2019s time for you to step up and do the job you signed up for.

As a mom I can\u2019t help but always wonder about my child when I\u2019m not with her. But I\u2019m not going to let it show or let it ruin my night out with my husband.

It does matter that you are refusing her request and dismissing her outright.", ">But in this case the \"punishment\" would be not being able to attend my friend's birthday, and then being home alone and bored while my daughter sleeps.\n\nDo you consider that your wife is regularly being 'punished' by staying at home, alone after your daughter has gone to sleep? Perhaps being bored because you had a better offer than staying with her?\n\nWhy is it OK for her to stay home alone, but not for you?", "I don\u2019t care if you said it to someone, or if it was just written here. It\u2019s an asshole thing to say about your child. You are not being punished you are being held to your responsibility.\n\nBut also, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal for you to have a family member watch your two-year-old where you both go out.

I will not stay here and babysit while you go out and enjoy yourself.\u201d  \n\nBy arranging childcare, you are communicating to her that anytime she wants to go out, she should be prepared for you to go out as well.

If you don\u2019t see how it is problematic, I can\u2019t help you.  \n\nFurthermore, by saying you\u2019ll take care of the pickup and dropoff, you are showing her that her night out costs *you* labor.", "Yes, I know what you mean.

Or do you only do that when you want to see friends?\n\nAlso, it would clearly make your wife more comfortable if you were to stay home with your child, but you don\u2019t want to do that. Maybe she\u2019s wondering what you will do when there are two kids to be looked after and will you keep prioritising your friends over your family.

I think both of you are probably doing your best and being a parent is hard, but as other people are saying, your wife doesn\u2019t go out often and she would like you to stay home this rare instance.

Because if your wife is always the one left alone all the time with the toddler while you go out and have fun and she wants to have one of her rare nights out, you would be pretty scummy if you weren't staying home until at least the baby sitter gets there to do any handover, and to make sure she's not having to cancel her plans if the baby sitter can't make it last minute.
