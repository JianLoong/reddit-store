{"id": 28740, "submission_id": "175xt2g", "title": "AITA for not staying home for the night with my daughter while my wife goes out with friends?", "selftext": "Background: My wife rarely goes out with friends (~6 times/year) and has never been very social and prefers spending time with me. I am more social, but that has declined as we have focused on our family (we have a 2 year old daughter), and I spend time with the same 3 friends once/week for games night (sometimes in person, sometimes online). I have another 3 friends that I see only once every 2 months, also for games night. If I go out my wife will tend to our daughter (I often still help with dinner/bed time, but sometimes leave earlier than this). Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time). I always offer for my wife sleep in the next day, or something similar in exchange for me going out so that It's not a one-sided thing.\n\nScenario: My wife made plans to spend an evening this weekend out with friends, she would be out from 6pm until late. After she made those plans, I was invited to my friends birthday thing with my \"second\" friend group, if I went I would be gone from 5pm until late. Last time I saw them was exactly one month ago. I brought this plan up with my wife as I wanted to make arrangements for a family member to take our daughter for the evening. She was irritated by this, and argued that I should stay home. I have since spoken with a family member who is happy to take our daughter at 5pm and have her stay the night and I have communicated this to my wife.\n\nI made it clear that this will not affect her plans at all, I will be responsible for dropoff and pickup of our daughter, and will not ask anything of my wife because I understand that it is rare for her to have a night out like this and so I don't want her to change her plans at all. She still thinks that I should stay home.\n\nHer arguments:\n\n- She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her\n- She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them\n\nMy arguments:\n\n- I am covering for her as she does not have to change her plans and doesn't have to do anything for our daughter\n- This family member loves watching our daughter, and my wife is often quick to agree to leave our daughter there for sleepovers plenty of other evenings out of convenience (eg: we will be there for dinner and put our daughter to sleep there so we can visit longer, then we will leave her there for the night) so I don't see why this time its too much to ask\n\nI feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer. \"Punishment\" feels too strong of a word, I don't think there is any major resentment behind this or anything, I just don't know how else to describe the feeling.\n\nSo, AITA here for making plans to go out the same night my wife also already had plans to go out, even though I am covering all arrangements for our daughter for the evening?\n\nEdits:\n\n- Not sure why everyone thinks I'm planning on getting drunk, but I would not be drinking if I went to the birthday.\n- I would also be the \"on-call\" parent and would tend to our daughter in case of any emergency\n- I used the word \"cover\" to describe solo-parenting as that is the word my wife used when we spoke. Neither of us are the type of people to call parenting \"babysitting\" when it is solo.\n- The \"punishment\" I am referring to is about missing out on celebrating with a friend, it is NOT referring to spending time with my daughter\n- Just because my wife only goes out 6 times a year does not mean that is her only free time. We have 5 evenings free every week where she can either do her own thing or we can spend it together. We share the evening \"on-duty\" time equally\n- The vast majority (like 90% or more) of my time out is spent after my daughter is asleep, the normal routine is for both of us to do dinner/bath/bed routine, and then for me to leave afterwards\n- The family member I am referring to is on my wife's side, however we are very close with them and it is normal for me to talk to them directly, they feel just as much my family at this point as they are hers\n- The family member is also very experienced putting our daughter to bed without us being there\n- My daughter has her own room at this family members house, as well as another's. This is because they care for our daughter on the 3 days a week where both my wife and I work so that we don't have to pay for daycare. We are extremely lucky to have such helpful family, and the reason she has her own room/bed at these places isn't because we \"pawn her off\" there frequently, it is because she naps at these places 3 days a week, and on occasional evenings. Both family members are empty nesters who admittedly love caring for our daughter, and other young family members. We try to compensate them but they often refuse, and they even go so far as to ask to have our daughter over.", "created_utc": 1697083335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175xt2g/aita_for_not_staying_home_for_the_night_with_my/", "score": 6617, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She isn\u2019t necessarily going to worry all night, but she will be aware that your daughter is out of the house. She\u2019s going to mentally check in - now they are driving over, now she\u2019s likely settling down, now you are picking her up, time for bed again. \n\nEvery time she mentally check in she exerts a little effort. Maybe she glances out the window to check the weather is good for driving. Maybe she checks her watch or phone to see if you called. However, even the energy of simply having a thought adds up.\n\nIf your wife is like many parents I know, especially the main caregivers, she is always alert. She\u2019s always on. \n\nYou being home with your daughter doesn\u2019t turn that off but it does lesson the amount that it happens. The mental load of knowing your child is as safe as possible with their other parent is different from knowing they are driving around and at another house.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how safe it is - travel needs more attention than staying home.\n\nYou get to go out. You get mental breaks from parenthood. She doesn\u2019t get the same breaks. She\u2019s asking for one now.\n\nYou need to decide - does it really matter who\u2019s right here? Your wife is unhappy. This is rare occurrence for her that means a lot and you see your friends all the time. Even if you think my reasoning is completely irrelevant, is this birthday party *really* worth it?\n\nETA: When posts get this big I like to channel that energy as much as possible towards doing some good in the real world, especially when at the moment, for me, being able to comment at all on something small and innocuous like an Internet stranger deciding whether to use a babysitter currently feels like a luxury. I don\u2019t take it for granted.\n\nwww.NAMI.org is the National Alliance on Mental Illness. They accept donations and have one hotline available for everyone and one specifically for teens and young adults. \n\nwww.2020Mom.org is The Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, aka 2020 Mom. They advocate for policies in America that support the mental health of pregnant women and all parents.\n\nFor those who are focused on wanting to help those affected by bigger issues like war, conflict, and natural disasters due to recent and not so recent events, https://www.charitywatch.org has articles and lists of reliable charities for helping those in specific war zones and other dire situations.\n\nDonations are obviously not the only way to do good. Things as small as being mindful to be patient and kind makes everything a little bit better.\n\nWishing everyone both strong Internet and real world communities and support systems.", "I was on the fence until you said that parenting your kid was 'punishment'\n\nDude. So much the AH", "Look, YTA either way but what I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention is that you said you would be responsible for pick up and drop off. Sir, your daughter is two years old, picking her up after her bedtime is disruptive to her schedule and quite frankly (as a mother to three toddlers) this will make her cranky and want her mother. Not only that, I\u2019m guessing your daughter wakes up fairly early so, are you planning to get up with her in the morning? \nLet\u2019s be real, you said your wife rarely goes out. Give her this. Stay home with your daughter and get up with her in the morning.", "How often do you spend 1-on-1 time with your daughter? I\u2019d be frustrated that you seem to put your friends first so often.", "YTA, she barely goes out. You go out all the time! Why can\u2019t you give your wife this one night and spend time with your toddler???", "Do you think the wife feels a small amount of guilt for asking for a babysitter. Even though my parents happily watch my kid. I still feel like I need to not ask too much as I don't want them to get burnt out and as the 'mother' I feel like I am somewhat slacking in my duties to have an overnight babysitter it's a strange feeling as even though they enjoy it I feel bad. Then when you were staying home to watch her that burden was on the other parent and not making her feel that layer of guilt. I hate wasting family babysitting nights as I don't like to do it too often so maybe she would rather you guys spend a child free night together and both enjoy it whereas this was meant to be one of her few outings and now she's wasted her babysitter night for awhile and it's just an extra one for you to add to your list if you get what I am saying.\n\nJust my opinion as someone in a very similar situation.", "YTA - Really inconsiderate here. Parenting your daughter isn\u2019t a punishment, it\u2019s what happens when you decide to have a child with your wife. You go out much more often than she does. Your wife understandably wants you to take care of her for one night, & i totally understand not trusting even family with her, if that\u2019s the issue. Most CSA comes from family.. disregarding any of that, you\u2019re her FATHER and she\u2019s your DAUGHTER. Why is it so hard for you to watch her? Shirking the responsibility onto someone else instead of watching her for one night is wrong. Your friends should understand you have a child and can\u2019t go out whenever. Grow up, she\u2019s your child too.", "Your wife goes out six times a year. That\u2019s six nights that you are required to be the Dad and it\u2019s too much for you?YTA and your wife may be questioning your commitment level.", ">I am covering for her\n\nNo, you're not. Someone else is. Get that straight. And you're missing out on some great memories with your kid that you can never replace.", "YTA. You see your friends *far* more frequently than your wife sees hers. You\u2019re long overdue to take more turns staying home. \n\nWhen\u2019s the last time you and your wife went out together? You should save your babysitting credits with your family members for date nights, not just nights where you go hang out with your friends by yourself like usual. \n\nThe fact that you think it\u2019s a punishment to stay at home with your own child while your wife has an extremely rare night out is really telling. Stay home with the kid, apologize to your wife, and plan a date night soon where the family member can babysit.", "This is definitely not going the way OP planned. He genuinely thought there would be an echo chamber here", "YTA - you seriously can\u2019t stay home for one night?", "YTA\n\nYou calling parenting a punishment, make you the AH. \n\nYou guys having nights out is whatever, but parenting your child isn't a punishment.", "YTA. Daughter comes first.", "Based on the fact that you are disagreeing with every comment, you didn\u2019t come here with an open mind you came here looking for people to agree with you.  \n\nYou go out every week with your friends. Do you know how many parents do that who have a toddler? Few. Who is looking after your child during this time? Your wife. \n\nYou can justify it all you want to internet strangers but ultimately your wife did not want you to do this and you put seeing your friends above her wishes. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. It is a matter of commitment\u2014 to your wife, to your daughter, to your family unit. You aren\u2019t willing to miss one little social event to spend one-on-one time with your daughter, to give your wife peace of mind that your daughter is safe and sound at home in her own bed.", "You should be excited to spend the evening with your daughter solo. Make it a fun night with dad for her.", "YTA. You're pawning your daughter off because of what you want to do instead of being a dad (so much for focusing on family). Having your child in the hands of another person immediately creates stress for the (seemingly) more involved parent, the sitters, and the child.\n\nYou can miss one night with your friends.", "NTA. i just dont understand the down votes. Im with OP. why cant they both have a night out. The baby is with someone who has done this frequently before.", "So I think people have already made it clear yta here, but I want you to try to look at it this way to help you understand why. When you go out, it\u2019s not even a second thought to you that your wife is at home with your baby. You trust your wife with your daughter, I\u2019m sure you check in and communicate while you\u2019re out but you know you can comfortably enjoy your nights out knowing that your daughter is safe and well cared for by her mom. If you and your wife go out on a date night (when\u2019s the last time you did that btw just curious?) and a family member watches your baby for you, you\u2019re a little more conscious that someone else outside of her two main caregivers are watching her. You probably can\u2019t relax and let loose as much as you\u2019d really like to. Your wife simply wants the same respect, comfort, and convenience she provides to you when you go out. She doesn\u2019t want to worry about checking in with someone else while you two are out doing separate things. She wants to go out knowing her baby is safe at home with dad. \n\nAlso, any time you\u2019ve gone out have you ever offered to your wife to have a family member watch your baby so she could get some peace and relaxation time at home? Even if she\u2019s not going out, I think she would really appreciate the break from being alone with your daughter for once. \n\nI relate very much to this situation because it\u2019s extremely similar to my own. My husband is the social butterfly and i am the homebody. He goes out at least once a week sometimes more. When I want to go out, I either have to bring my daughter with me or ask someone to babysit her for me because he\u2019ll want to make plans on top of my plans. It\u2019s frustrating that he can come and go as he pleases but when I want to go somewhere he can\u2019t just be the one to sit at home for once. The things you\u2019ve said in your post parallel with a lot of excuses he\u2019s given me too. \n\nI hope this helps a bit to hear it from different angles.", "Just based on this, NTA. But you are quick to dismiss major resentment. Try to figure out what is really going on. Your wife is caring for your daughter alone once a week and you are never doing it? What does making it feel more even look like? A gym night? Another hobby? A few hours entirely alone when she can sit in a dark room and watch a movie with her favorite cocktail? Even if your wife is an introvert, she is still missing out on something from her pre-kid life by being primary parent and she still gets your support to replace that.", "YTA - can\u2019t even sacrifice one night for your wife to relax. You are very selfish.,", "Yta\n\nYou are not covering for HER but for yourself.   \n\nYou are a parent -act like one, not like a babysitter who nopes out for a school mixer.\n\nThis isn't essential or rare.", "Mate I don't know why you're being slammed so hard in these comments. \n\nYou both get to go out and the family member gets to see your daughter (which they love) \n\nUnless you've left out things you're NTA and the people here that aren't reading the entire post are out of line... it's not a zero sum game. \n\nYour wife is just concerned you're taking advantage of the family member too much... Is that the case? \n\nAnyway I hope you see this... I'm sure it'll be at the bottom \ud83e\udd23", "NTA", "YTA. \n\nYou are the asshole for the comment about parenting being punishment. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is an issue having a family member, watch your toddler so you can both go out. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue.", "NAH.\n\nI think your wife's reaction is born of resentment, rather than logic, but I have a lot of empathy for her in this situation. Your proposed solution makes perfect logical sense, but I suspect it provoked a strong emotional reaction from your wife due to some negative feelings that have been building up in her for a long time.\n\nShe sees you having lots of down time and having fun with your friends, and for whatever reason she is envious of that. Maybe she wishes she was more social, or had closer friends? Maybe she would like to have more time off to do hobbies on her own? Maybe she feels like your friends get more quality time with you than she does?\n\nWhatever the issue is, she clearly feels that your relationship is currently unbalanced in your favour. Rather than arguing over the specifics of this one particular fight, try talking to your wife about this issue more broadly. Let her know that her happiness is important to you, and you can tell that she's unhappy with how things are, and you want to hear from her about how she feels, and discuss potential changes that could be made to the current arrangements to make her feel better.\n\nAnd for the record, I see no reason why the solution needs to involve taking something away from you, but I do think it needs to involve giving something (time, space, whatever she needs) to your wife to help her feel happier. I think she also just needs to hear that her feelings are important to you, and that you're willing to make sacrifices for her (as she probably feels like she has been doing for you).", "You need to kindly ask her if she is irritated that you go out more frequently. Take it from me, you seem to just be starting out with your family, don't let resentment ride high because you're afraid to share your feelings for fear of a discussion. OR at least, you tell her that. Maybe that family member loves it, can't get enough of watching your child. Then you need to investigate where her head is at. It seems like you may need more social stimulation than her and it just now seems to be bugging her, if that even is the case.", "YTA. She rarely goes out and is always on mum duty. The occasion she has a chance to go out, you are still shirking your dad duty responsibilities and passing your daughter off to family members. You are also missing out on the chance for quality time where it's just you and her?Do you ever look after her by yourself?", "I'm going with NTA on this one. The kid is being taken care of by a family member who enjoys it. There's no reason you both can't go out and do your own things separately and still have fun.", "YTA.  You are being passive-aggressive as hell.  Yeah, she can go out but *so can you.*  That is what you are communicating to her.  And you know this.  Or else, you wouldn\u2019t perceive staying home to be a \u201cpunishment.\u201d\n\nYou are actually a massive asshole.", "YTA, you aren't showing your wife that your daughter is a priority to you over your friends. You scheduled things after she did, and did so unnecessarily, you spend time with friends all the time and regularly miss bed time. How do you think that will impact your relationship with your daughter? Also, parenting isn't a punishment in any way, you should be grateful for the opportunity to have some 1-on-1 time with your daughter  at bedtime.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is being cared for, and I think the \"punishment\" description is more spot-on than people are willing to admit. Wife wants you to have to stay home instead of going out like she does because she feels like it's a burden and wants to punish you with the same burden. She's going out to have fun, you're not allowed to go out and have fun, too, because she doesn't get to have fun when you otherwise go out!\n\nYou took responsibility and made arrangements. You are doing drop-off and pick-up. And you never told her she couldn't make alternate arrangements and go out on nights you go out with friends, or to even just have a quiet evening to herself. She acts like you're going out of your way to get out of parenting and avoid suffering like she does when your child will be asleep for the majority of your outing and will not be awake to care. A child you routinely participate in putting to bed, so it's not as if you never take responsibility for caring for your own child.\n\nShe seems to think this is a situation where one of you has to suffer while the other has a good time, and if one of you isn't suffering the same amount, it's unfair to the other person.", "YTA.\n\nBoy do I despise men that project their mommy issues on their wifes. What on earth feels so *punishing* to you? Spending time with your daughter, while your wife gets a fucking break for once? The fact that the whole house doesn't cater to your egocentrical thinking? You sound like a little boy whining to his mom right now and your wife will possibly (i'd say almost guaranteed) build resentment towards *that*. Your whole attitude towards \"but she gets to sleep in\", \"but she still gets to go\". Man, do you need me te spell it out for you?\n\nYour *pregnant* wife wants an evening out which she, from the sounds of it, barely has anyways. She is unhappy with the idea of a family member watching her kid. Why question her motives and pushing your agenda after she even told you *why*. What is possibly so god damn important at your \"bro's\" that you would risk your wife's once in a blue moon peaceful evening for, *after* SHE already made plans. It is not like you don't see them at all, you are even aware you see them enough weekly, with her at home, to the point where you \"think\" there is no resentment but you're not sure. This gives me the impression you are very aware of your egocentrical thinking. Even down to feeling entitled to plop your 2 year old kid at a family member whenever you feel like.\n\nAct like an adult male, give your wife a damn break, care for your daughter that evening and have whatever petty party on your own that you need to have. But let your wife have one evening. You are going out weekly ffs. Also, are you as much of an attentive father that you think you are? You seem to think that it's not worth it for you to take care of her because it is \"just dinner and to bed\". What? There are a million ways to wonderfully bond with your daughter during the \"mundane\". Seems you have a perfect evening to learn about those.", "YTA", "YTA. Your wife asked you to watch your daughter. As soon as a better option came up, you bailed. It's all well and good that you've arranged alternative care, but you've shown your wife you can not be relied on when asked.", "Nta. Kid is being looked after anyway", "What is up with all the YTA's? \n\nThis is clearly a care of NAH. It's one of those situations where one of them plans out the evening in their head and then the other one makes different plans. Both plans are fine, but when your partners plan differs from yours that sometimes throws you off. She had this vision of the evening. He changed the vision. I would probably be upset about that too, simply because \"arggghhh change\". And it would take me a while to be okay with the sudden change. Some people just don't handle change as well as we like to think we do. \n\nBut I don't for a second believe that your wife wants to punish you for going out more. If she's like me she actually appreciates the alone time with no one around to decompress. My one question is: how has she reacted in the past when OP's plans were cancelled? Because that will tell us if she just dislikes sudden change.", "In this house, OP >>> wife > daughter.

All these people are missing the forest for the trees.\nA single instance isn't indicative of any major patterns and it sounds like you have an excellent cover for your kid.

I am more social, but that has declined as we have focused on our family (we have a 2 year old daughter), and I spend time with the same 3 friends once/week for games night (sometimes in person, sometimes online). I have another 3 friends that I see only once every 2 months, also for games night. If I go out my wife will tend to our daughter (I often still help with dinner/bed time, but sometimes leave earlier than this). Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time). I always offer for my wife sleep in the next day, or something similar in exchange for me going out so that It's not a one-sided thing.\n\n**Scenario:** My wife made plans to spend an evening this weekend out with friends, she would be out from 6pm until late. After she made those plans, I was invited to my friends birthday thing with my \"second\" friend group, if I went I would be gone from 5pm until late. Last time I saw them was exactly one month ago. I brought this plan up with my wife as I wanted to make arrangements for a family member to take our daughter for the evening. She was irritated by this, and argued that I should stay home. I have since spoken with a family member who is happy to take our daughter at 5pm and have her stay the night and I have communicated this to my wife.\n\nI made it clear that this will not affect her plans at all, I will be responsible for dropoff and pickup of our daughter, and will not ask anything of my wife because I understand that it is rare for her to have a night out like this and so I don't want her to change her plans at all. She still thinks that I should stay home.\n\n**Her arguments:**\n\n- She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her\n- She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them\n\n**My arguments:**\n\n- I am covering for her as she does not have to change her plans and doesn't have to do anything for our daughter\n- This family member loves watching our daughter, and my wife is often quick to agree to leave our daughter there for sleepovers plenty of other evenings out of convenience (eg: we will be there for dinner and put our daughter to sleep there so we can visit longer, then we will leave her there for the night) so I don't see why this time its too much to ask\n\nI feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer. \"Punishment\" feels too strong of a word, I don't think there is any major resentment behind this or anything, I just don't know how else to describe the feeling.\n\nSo, AITA here for making plans to go out the same night my wife also already had plans to go out, even though I am covering all arrangements for our daughter for the evening?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He ensured that his wife wouldn't need to do anything.\n\nMeanwhile, OP's wife's arguments are extremely weak.\n\n>She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her\n\nOP IS covering for her by ensuring that she is able to go out for the night without having to take care of their daughter.\n\n>She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them\n\nIf she really feels this way, OP and his wife can do a little something to show their appreciation for this family member. OP asked, and the other party agreed to watch their daughter. There's no need to shy away from asking for help from a family member as long as they're ok with helping.

She needs time with her friends too.", "Ugghh. YTA and looking by the comments you're leaving in the thread, clearly not someone good at listening. The carefreeness one feels when one's child is in the safety of a parent is much much different than having it constantly at the back of your mind that there's a relative taking care of it instead, no matter how much the thought is pushed back. She's not asking too much from you, and if you can't even do this much, I wonder how long she'd want to stay married before she figures out how you don't prioritise her needs above yours.", "YTA.

Your wife rarely goes out or socialises with friends, but you do, therefore she covers for your social life a lot. You on the other hand don\u2019t have to cover for her that often. And even on one of those rare occasions where she has arranged a night out where you are responsible for the childcare, something comes up that you would prefer to do and you prioritise that over commitment you made to your wife. You are selfish. That is why your wife is angry with you. You sir, are a selfish asshole. You are showing how you think and that it\u2019s all a me, me, me with you.", "YTA she wants to go out for 1 of her 6 yearly outings and feel safe and secure that her daughter is home with her father. You are so selfish", "I\u2019m slightly baffled by all the Y T As. There seems to be a lot of assumptions on your parenting skills based on the fact that you like to be social. As someone who has raised three kids and liked to be social while doing so, please allow me to give you some advice. \n\nYou need to ask your wife what bothers her about your leaving your child with a family member. It might be that she doesn\u2019t want to impose on them. But it also might be that she doesn\u2019t truly relax unless she knows you\u2019re with your toddler. That\u2019s how I always felt. Anyone else could have called me any minute and tapped out, but my husband is my parenting partner and was completely capable of watching my girls. \n\nAlso, when my girls were little, my husband and I promised each other that we would never be martyrs. We would never agree to something we didn\u2019t want to do, just to hold it over someone else\u2019s head. We communicated openly and honestly when we needed time to ourselves, time with each other or time with our friends. And I believe there was a time or two that we got a sitter but did things separately. (And my kids turned out great!)\n\nGood luck! NAH", "NTA.  Your child gets to be looked after by someone who it sounds like is super happy to hang out with her, and who you can trust completely (given that you say you've left her with this person before).  You both get your night out.  It's lovely for kids to have a range of adults in their lives who love them, it's good for parents to be rounded individuals with lives outside of parenthood and it's a treat for the person looking after her to get hang-out time (I say this as someone with niblings).\n\nI think it's worth further exploring with your wife why she feels like this - there are some interested comments about emotional labour and resentment - but you can acknowledge, explore and address her feelings without necessarily indulging the outcome of them.  Does she need encouraging to do more socialising on her own?  Do you guys need to do more together (either as a two or as a three)?  Does she just need to hear from the babysitter (apologies, I don't know who it is so don't have a better word) that this is actually something they'd enjoy too?", "NTA, and I say this as the less sociable spouse who often stays home with the kids. If there is an occasion where we both have plans, we also go to a family member to take the kids overnight. This works better for everyone because the kids have fun with their family, and the adults get to have a fun night without worrying about what time we get home, or being woken up early by the children so there\u2019s a bonus lie in too.\n\nI think you\u2019re right, your wife is frustrated that you\u2019re out more than her and thinks it\u2019s unfair. I understand her feelings, so maybe this is more a NAH, but maybe offer to make it up to her by suggesting a girls weekend or similar where you *will* stay home with the toddler.", "You spent the time writing all this when you are obviously the TAH.

I think you and her being able to go out on the same night seperately while a family member looks after them is a good solution.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have plans you would have looked after your daughter right? I don\u2019t see a problem here. \n\nThe only potential problem I sense here is your wife probably feels like she gives a lot in looking after the baby especially since she doesn\u2019t go out a lot - going out 6 times a year is equivalent to going out once every 2 months. She doesn\u2019t have an outlet to release her stress. I would suggest once every month you offer something nice to her eg a 2 hour massage voucher where she and or friend relaxes while you look after the baby.", "Bruh just look after your daughter you butthole", "Honestly, NTA.

The \"punishment\" I am referring to would be not being able to attend a friends birthday. And as I said in the post, \"punishment\" is a strong term and not really the right word for it.

If I stayed home, all I would do is make dinner and then put her to bed.", "For additional context, a very common routine of ours is spending dinner/evening at this exact family member's house, putting our daughter to sleep, and then waking her up later to bring her home for the rest of the night. It does not make her cranky and does not affect her waking time in the morning the next day. This night in question would be no different if I were to pick her up at night. But as stated in the post this family member is happy to have her over night, with me picking her up in the morning.", "The friend time I spend is 90% of the time after my daughter's bed time.

The family member that would be watching her does so very often, and enthusiastically. And many times my wife will be the first one to agree with them to have our daughter stay the night there after we already were there for dinner (we are there once a week, every week, for dinner). This family is a couple who are empty nesters (one son moved out a few years ago).", "Trusting family, or worrying about CSA is 100% not a factor here. We spend tons of time with these family members, and they watch our daughter often. I do not consider spending time with my daughter as punishment.

The rest of the evening would not be spent with her.", "I am a dad much more than 6 nights a year.

I guess where I struggle is that there are many other times where we have been out together and our daughter's wellbeing staying with a family member does not seem to be an issue, or a worry that would make the night less enjoyable for my wife. But perhaps in those situations, since she is with me, it is worth it to her.", "Well said! I think there is something deeper here and its not that OP wants to go to a birthday party, it's that OP seemingly  (based on this post)  gets \"me time\" far more often than his wife.

In my opinion I think it's more resentment that you're invited out all the time, this was her night to let loose and you're changing the plans so she might not be as comfortable (whether it's being uncontactable or too far away if your daughter needs you).

I have not confirmed anything yet and my wife is not under the impression that I have. And sorry but \"regularly miss bedtime\" is just blatantly false. I have plans with friends once a week. So at the MOST I would theoretically miss 14% of bed times. However, I more often than not will do bed time before I leave to spend time with friends (probably close to 75% of the time that I go out I will still do bed time). So in reality I maybe miss 3% of bed times, and that is assuming that my weekly plans actually happen every week, but sometimes they are cancelled for one reason or another (more often than not that cancellation comes from my end due to prioritizing family matters over my plans with friends).", "Yeah I'm a little confused by the ytas in here.

However every time we try to compensate them in any way it is declined. They go out of their way to spend time with our daughter. They are quite well off and only work part time, so it is hard to really offer them much that they can't already have. Whenever we have the opportunity to help them with anything, we jump on it. We even went so far as to offer to install in-ground irrigation for their front and back yard/garden (on our dime, and labor) as I have experience with that, they very very reluctantly agreed and then later eventually convinced us not to do that for them.", "Thank you for the advice, this is likely how I will approach the conversation tomorrow when we pick it up again.", "The man gets to hang out with friends every week on his own admission, that is so much more often than so many adults get to do\u2026\u2026 why can\u2019t he do for her what she does for him so routinely?", "You could play with her, read a few stories enjoy dinner with her.

Since you will be dropping her off at 5:00 and then the hope is that she\u2019d fall asleep without you there at 7:30. Often times 2-year old can fall asleep easily if a parent is there, as you have done in the past, but if the parent is not there, the child may get anxious and not be able to sleep. YOU are not putting her to sleep, your family member is. 2 year olds can be pretty fussy about this. \n\nThis may cause your wife to worry during her night out, instead of enjoying her night out as she would if your daughter was home with you.

emphasis on the perceive -- it's not about whether she *is* based off a logical breakdown of time/chores, it's about whether she *thinks* she is. and if she does -- why? further -- who does your DAUGHTER perceive to be her \"main parent\"? who does she go to when she's hurt, or has a question, or has a nightmare, or needs something? is it possible that the time/chores/stuff you do for your daughter/household is more practical and less emotional, and therefore does not build as deep of a bond with your daughter as the work your wife does? basically, i think your wife wants you to take this chance when you're alone with your daughter to build the same relationship with her that your wife has. she wants you and your daughter to have a closer relationship, for your daughter to know and rely on you as much as she does your wife. it's also possible she's tired of being the primary/main, and wants you to be equal parents. this night is just step one in that direction. \n\n(side note/observation: your wife might be looking at things in the long term/trends, while you seem to be looking at things in an isolated, individual way. keep that in mind for future disagreements).\n\nthe last reason, and imo the most important one, is that *she wants you to stay home.* it honestly doesn't really matter if it's logical, it doesn't really matter if you don't *need* to, it doesn't really matter if someone else can watch her and you can both have your night out. she's asking you to stay home, staying home would make her happy, you should do it. it's a small ask, and doesn't put you out too much. yeah it sucks you won't get to see your friends and celebrate their birthday, but if they mean that much to you then you should organize another night out for you to spend with them to make up for it. i know that just on principle it seems unreasonable, and you still might not Get It, and maybe you're even worried about slippery slopes and not wanting to entertain crazy demands just to make the wife happy. but ask yourself \u2014 does she always make unreasonable demands? is this a running theme? or is it that every so often she asks for something that you can't understand why, but it wouldn't be the hardest thing for you to do? because there are times where we can't really understand the reason why someone does something, but we can accept that they *do* and respond accordingly. your choice here is to use logic to deny your wife's feelings, or to accept that she feels the way she does and do what you can to make her happy. \n\nthat's why my judgment is YTA and not NAH. it's because while logically you *may* be right (and that's only if the first two reasons i offered were wrong), your wife is having emotions and the kind thing to do would be to acknowledge that and do what you can to help, even if it involves a bit of sacrifice. \n\n[this tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8rWTj8o/) about logic, emotions, and empathy is some good food for thought and informed a lot of my perspective. hope it helps :)", "\" Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time).

The reason for this may be because she feels like you go out too much, but for the specifics of the post, you have done nothing wrong.\n\nHowever, I would still advise you to sit down and talk about her real issues here because her given reasons make no sense without additional context and I am not going down the rabbit hole of making assumptions like other commenters.", "NTA i'm confused by these comments. why do so many people say that this guy doesn't parent his daughter? he goes out once a week after his daughter is in bed and occasionally goes out to see a different friend group that he doesn't get to see often. when he does that he lets his wife sleep in and takes over morning duty. his daughter is being watched over by a trusted family member. \n\nif she goes out with friends another time and he doesn't have an event with a group he doesn't see often then he would watch his daughter. it seems he would do this happily. my parents have had different events on the same day and left me with a babysitter before. \n\nthe most i can say is that OP might have some undealt with resentment on the part of his wife. she should say she'd feeling resentful though so they can work out a different schedule. maybe if she's not social she would like some alone time so they should factor that in like she should be able to have sunday nights to herself since OP has game nights on like friday or saturday.", "I think its crazy people are saying your TA. NTA you have a babysitter you both trust with your child. Of roles were reversed this wouldn't have been the same results", "YTA for all the well described reasons others have listed and I'll add one more I haven't seen yet: after her first response that you in fact stay at home like you agreed instead of squirming your way out of being the sole caregiver to your child one out of apparently SIX nights a year... you *still* went behind her back and asked someone else! She said no, and then you tried to corner her into saying yes by getting approval from someone outside of this exchange. You also are potentially embarrassing her in front of a family member by making her out to be the \"bad guy\" here. That is just disrespect on top of disrespect. \n\nI also find it highly suspicious that you say your wife said she felt like you guys are taking advantage of this family member sometimes and you explicitly neglected to describe who this person is. \n\nIs it because it would make us feel even more so that you are the AH and you know this? You don't seem to accept anyone's judgement, no matter how fairly and accurately it's worded, so that's likely the case. Maybe it's your wife's parent or sibling whom you went and requested a bailout from and not even a member of your own family.", "NTA\n\nThe title makes it sound like she wont be ablt to go out, but that is not the case at all.

You are selfish.", "NAH you've made plans for your daughter to stay with a family member that loves having her. You'll be dropping her off and picking her up the next day, so I see no issue. Maybe something is bothering your wife and you should both talk about it, because from this post I don't see any issues with what you proposed.", "The automatic vitriol from most people on here is shocking and I don't think it's warranted based on your calm and reasonable responses.\nIt seems like a lot of people think parenting must be a complete sacrifice of every scrap of your individuality and your own needs. While obviously children take top priority I think this mindset is really damaging and leads to resentful, miserable parenting that isn't good for anyone.\n\nI'm speaking from the experience of having an amazing childhood and parents that are still together. I had what seems like a similar set up to yours at my grandma's house. She had a spare room set up for the grandkids and we were there extremely regularly, with or without my parents and often slept over. My grandma adored spending this kind of quality time with us, we loved staying over at hers, my parents got time to relax and feel like people again. It was a win win situation. On other occasions we had the next door neighbor babysit and this was also fine as we were loved children who grew up secure and independent knowing that our parents were going to come back tomorrow/in a few hours and everything will be fine.\n\nI find it really sad that people refuse themselves any tiny break in parenting even when options are available. You are not out every night getting wasted, you are playing board games with a small group of close friends. A wholesome activity that you can step away from if there is any emergency that requires you to switch back to parent mode.\n\nOnto your predicament. I don't think  YTA, it seems like you are communicating with your partner about what to do and haven't made any unilateral decisions yet. You do need to continue to discuss why she has an issue and how to fix that without you just staying at home for the sake of arbitrary fairness. Would it help if you went an hour or two later to your friends so you can do bedtime etc with your kid first and she's already out? Can you organise a day when you take your kid out one on one somewhere and she has time to relax and do whatever introvert activity she enjoys? Do you guys need a date night to spend some quality, non parenting time together and can you organise that for her? Does she have anxiety of you not being home with the kid or is it about fairness? \n\nI feel like these are more useful suggestions than 'stay home, shut up and be miserable like everyone else'.", "Apparently an unpopular opinion here but NTA. Everything is covered. You\u2019re still making sure she is taken care of. There\u2019s no reason you both can\u2019t go out.", "I\u2019m actually going to go with NAH. You found a perfectly reasonable solution to a problem. In the same way she wants to go out so do you. This is a problem solved. To those of you saying what if she\u2019s anxious and it ruins her night. This is something she needs to work on especially if the child is going to be with a family member. It\u2019s good for kids to stay with other people sometimes.", "NTA, and I was totally going the opposite until I saw that there is a family member who sometimes watches the daughter who is willing to take her. And of course, only if OP is willing to not drink, come instantly if something comes up, and cancel plans if the daughter or the babysitter get sick. If the wife feels they are asking to much without tje family member having said so, it's on her. And if she also could have a weekly night of, doing sports, courses or whatever if she doesn't have more friends or doesn't want to go out, that's also up to her. If the wife chooses to stay home, that doesn't mean OP has to do the same as long as there isn't an emergency and options available. This is more about control than a healthy relationship.", "YTA", "NTA ! I dont understand all the YTA votes.

How do you expect him to replace those memories?  /S", "In the event that the scenario was similar (i.e. every time OP goes out, his wife asks the person mentioned in the post to watch their daughter, so him doing the same wouldn't be different), then I would say that OP would have a point.\n\nInstead, this guy is being purposefully obtuse. He is trying to equate calling upon a *babysitter* to him being responsible for watching his daughter.", "There is also some level of optics here.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, the moment the OP is asked to handle childcare alone so she can go out, he offloads the responsibility on a family member.

If this family member is even more important for securing this for OP's wife, I understand why she would be hesitant to ask this family member in this situation as well.\n\nIt wasn't mentioned, but I sure hope OP takes care of looking after their daughter the evenings OP isn't out with friends to make sure his wife gets some mental free time even when they are both home.", "As a mother of 3 Thankyou for putting this into words.

OP needs to put learn how to put others first\n\n Yes I did text him a few times during the night, but it was to keep him posted on OUR shenanigans and NOT to check in on the kids because I knew they were safe with him. \n\nWhen our kids are being babysat I am constantly checking my phone to make sure I have service and haven't missed any calls. It is so hard to switch off parent mode as the primary parent but knowing they are with their dad does make it easier.", "Jumping on the top comment to say that this has been a super interesting discussion, because I am literally reading this after having put my toddler to bed while my partner is out for his weekly game night (MTG, as a matter of fact, like what OP plays apparently). \n\nI am also the more introverted one, who rarely goes out while my partner has his weekly game nights & enjoys more frequent nights out. The only difference between our situation & OP\u2019s is that we are not as lucky, in that we don\u2019t have a reliable babysitter. If I were to go out, my partner would definitely have to stay home. But if we did have a babysitting resource like OP, I can see this situation coming up & my partner asking the same question as OP.\n\n& I would react the same as his wife. & I actually would wonder if I were the asshole & it\u2019s almost gratifying to see many people here coming down on the wife\u2019s side, because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to argue that OP\u2019s logic is pretty sound. Yet I, like his wife, would want my partner to stay home & would be upset if he still wanted to go out. & seeing so many people explain why she\u2019s justified to want OP to stay home is reassuring to me.\n\n- The mental load of preparing for the kid\u2019s overnight stay: OP could argue that he\u2019d do all this prep, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to turn my brain off & not think about the logistics of having my kid stay the night at someone else\u2019s house \u2014 BTW has she done this before? Actually stay overnight at this babysitter\u2019s house without either parents? As a parent, I\u2019d have separation anxiety about it, especially since the kid is only 2.\n\n- The mental load of being on call: OP mentioned wife is pregnant, which means wife will not be drinking during her night out \u2014 will she not then be the default emergency parent to be called if something urgent happened? I don\u2019t think OP even considered not drinking completely on his night out (he mentioned having only a few drinks, but not nothing). If I were his wife, I\u2019d be annoyed with the assumption that since I won\u2019t be drinking, OP then can still drink, knowing that if there is an emergency call from babysitter, one parent (the pregnant one) would definitely be sober.\n\n- The mental load of having to be the bad guy by going against OP\u2019s flawless logic that both of them can still go out. Like I said, OP\u2019s logic is techincally sound, so the burden of having to go against that logic will be on the wife & I wonder if she\u2019d be feeling guilty about saying no from an emotional place, because it makes her out to be the bad guy (the party pooper) for OP?\n\n- The mental load of relying on this babysitter too much (using the favour for separate nights out instead of date nights, which should be more important to OP than his friend\u2019s bday) & also for the perception that OP prefers to go out than taking care of daughter?\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s an outright asshole, even if I am also on the side of his wife. I appreciate him bringing this up for discussion if nothing else.", "Plus the wife may not want to use up the other sitter\u2019s good will or willingness to babysit. Maybe she\u2019s thinking it might be better to ask them when they can both go out for a date night?", "I\u2019m also wondering if he goes through all the work of shipping their daughter off so he can go party, but does nothing for the two of them.", "Fun to see that OPs wife is pregnant too. Which makes this even harder.\n\nThe more I think about this post the angrier I get. I have a two year old and a newborn. I would leave my husband if he treated me this way. Really. Game nights with friends every week? Are these game nights after quality time with wife and when kid is in bed? \n\nMy husband and I finally have a nice routine, we both game once both kids are asleep. But this is normally after 8pm. And then he knows if toddler wakes up, he has to settle her again because if baby wakes up I settle him again. I cannot fathom him leaving the house to go game while I\u2019m alone with both kids after a full day of working, chores and kids.\n\nETA: you\u2019re all acting like I\u2019m my husband\u2019s keeper.

OP probably is thinking that he doesn\u2019t even go out that often, and to some he does and some he doesn\u2019t, but from wife\u2019s  perspective he does and unfortunately that factor is at play here. Someone else has mentioned, how often do you go out/stay home with your wife and arrange childcare? I get the resentment from the wife because for me, I am also a homebody & introvert, and I think my husband forgets that, while I am a homebody & introvert, I do enjoy one on one time with him so sometimes I would like to go out just us two\u2026 but he is used to me not wanting to go out with friends and so he just assumes I never want to go out at all.

I can't find anything wrong with what you're suggesting.  I'm a mother of 2 (both adults now), who was actually a stay-at-home mother, also very introverted and rarely went out. As long as my plans weren't impacted, I wouldn't have cared if my husband then also made plans as long as he took care of EVERYTHING with respect to planning (packing, drop off, pick up etc.).

If not, you may be the asshole for assuming your wife is okay with the frequency of your socializing, while leaving her alone to care for your child. At such a young age, the frequency you mentioned is actually quite a lot (and will be an even bigger ask of your wife once you have 2 children).  If you've discussed it, and your wife is fully on board, great! Not my place to say it's too much for your family. However, given your wife's reaction to you making plans to go out when it won't actually impact her, maybe she is feeling like you already go out too much?  So even if you've already talked about it, it could be time to reevaluate together, especially with another child on the way.

Now those instances are going to be *more* than few and far between. \n\nIn reading OP's comments, he *does* goes out frequently. I don't fault people who are parents who want to go out.

Even if she just needs a night solo to watch a movie, why can't she use her words to express that to him?  I think too often people expect women to just figure out what their wife needs, instead of the wife saying what she needs.", "I'd say NTA based on what's said here but OP's wife had arranged her night out first so it's possible he'd agreed he would stay home with his daughter and has since changed his mind as he's now had a better offer", "OP, If I may: Really listen to your wife when you talk with her. Listen to understand, not to respond. Based on your other replies here, it seems like you might be more in the habit of responding. \n\nYour situation sounds a lot like mine when I was pregnant with my second kid. I'm getting a divorce because my soon to be ex husband wouldn't try to understand me. He had to out-logic and talk over me until I caved to his plans. The emotional load of being a mother is exhausting and I lacked the energy to fight just to have my voice heard when I knew the words wouldn't resonate. Two year olds are little wild monkeys. And pregnancy makes everything so much more tiresome. She just wants to feel like it's her turn, for a change. \n\nJust let her have the night. Let her be the priority for once.", "The most helpful answer eh? \nWhy? Because it puts all the blame in your wife?", "Agreed it\u2019s more resentment than anything. She might not even realize why she\u2019s feels this way. Sure, she plays online with her friends after she does dinner, bath, bed alone, but she\u2019s still \u2018on duty\u2019. She cannot fully checkout like you get to when you\u2019re out. She\u2019s carrying the majority of the emotional load, and I can tell you it\u2019s exhausting AF. \n\nOne thing you could do is take the baby out of the house and let her have a night to herself at home. I\u2019m a SAHM and I love being home as my downtime. All my comforts and to just do what *I* want to do without worrying about someone else. For example: For the first time in the 15 years we\u2019ve been parents, my husband took our kids camping alone this summer. I sent the dog away too. I hadn\u2019t really ever had more an hour fully alone in my house (sad, right?) OMG it was so quiet. Truly quiet. And that first night I realized how much I mentally check in on everyone and everything in my world. Constantly. Who needs to be where? Have they eaten? When do they need to be picked up? Do we need groceries? What\u2019s for <insert every single meal here>? Did I swap laundry? I need to vacuum. Omg this bathroom needs to be cleaned. Someone\u2019s birthday is next week, I need to get a gift. Mentally planning for upcoming holidays, and vacations, remembering all the family/friends birthdays and making sure cards/gifts are handled. And on and on and on.  I had to keep reminding myself that nobody needed anything from me for an entire 48 hours and I could just stop. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this is exactly how your dynamic works. But I can tell you it\u2019s exhausting being \u201con\u201d all the time. Especially as an introvert. You go out all the time. (Seriously, the amount you go out is crazy to me.) She\u2019s pregnant and exhausted (me, assuming) and the one night she goes out you can\u2019t be bothered to stay home and do the parent shit alone. Your solution is good, and I give you credit for making the arrangements, etc., but that\u2019s not what this is about. You\u2019re not carrying your weight of the emotional load here. And having been married for 21 years, I can also tell you if you don\u2019t nip that in the bud right now, and work on giving her some time where someone isn\u2019t always touching her or needing her in some capacity, the resentment will continue to build. (See above example from a wife who let this nearly identical scenario go on far too long.) It\u2019s obvious you care for your family and want to understand what the problem is, and I commend you for that.  But, I think it\u2019s more about you stepping up and handling the toddler alone, and giving your wife a break. Just because she doesn\u2019t like to leave the house as much as you do, doesn\u2019t negate the fact she also needs time to regroup. Toddlers are A LOT. Even the easy ones. And being pregnant on top of it? Holy shit. \n\nGentle YTA. But kudos for reaching out to others and trying to understand her perspective.

He also isn't throwing a tantrum or trying to make his wife miss her night. He acknowledges the disparity in their social outings, encourages her to go more often, tries to pick up slack, and when this situation arose posed a question to get a better consensus. This strikes me as a person who just doesn't understand, and without more information I'm with him. He likely doesn't want to see it as punishment from his wife, but following his logic in the post there isn't really an alternative reason. He's not drinking, he organized the sitter, mom is comfortable with this sitter for overnight visits. It strikes me as the wife's reasoning is \"dude, you're out every week, you can't just take one off? I have\" which is essentially punishment if he's found alternative care she's been comfortable with in the past.

You decide that your socialising is a reasonable amount, and your wife doesn't do much, you decide it is reasonable to ask a family member for more when your wife disagrees, and that the balance of work is fair when you go out, your wife cares for your daughter and in return you let her sleep in. Can you see that \\*you\\* are the one deciding, independently i imagine given your wife's reaction to asking the family member, that the balance of effort and appreciation is even? I suspect from your wife's reaction that all of these are somewhat skewed in some way. Perhaps she resents your gaming weekly habits already but doesn't want to say anything because she believes going out around 6 times a year is too much for her? I would \\*strongly\\* suggest if she thinks you're taking advantage of a family member's kindness, then you're taking advantage of a family member's kindness and you need to do more to show appreciation and ask a little less of them - especially with another child on the way she is probably thinking 'we cannot afford to burn out this person and turn their kindness into resentment' (which she's conscious of, i'd guess, because she feels that way....).   \n\n\nSo please, YTA, in the main thrust of your argument but probably more importantly in the subtext here. You sound like you're genuinely trying to learn so take a minute to reflect, find a female friend (for context I just had a big blow out with two male friends where they royally took the piss on a week's holiday and when i decided with one of them we could maybe patch this up, it included a thorough examination of why he felt he'd done enough when i was humiliated by how little he'd done and it eventually turned to 'do you not see how much \\[female-friend\\] does? have you never noticed that she always does X, invariably does Y and incidentally always Z for you?' and the answer was no, he'd never noticed...) so i suggest finding a woman you know and admire for her thoughtfulness and asking \\*her\\* how your balance is going, your mates are also the ones taking a night a week off their families to play games so if, as you say, you don't want an echo chamber, ask someone else - maybe that family member you asked to help?

My husband and I rarely get date nights. When we do his brother is happy to watch our kids for us. We don\u2019t ask often because we don\u2019t want to take advantage of his time. However, when we do go out it\u2019s rarely for more than 2ish hours because we have the thought of not leaving him to watch our kids any longer than necessary. So while it\u2019s unspoken the undercurrent is still there. He\u2019s always happy to watch our kids and their a bit older and independent so it\u2019s easy for him plus they have fun together but we also appreciate the fact that he\u2019s doing it on his own time.

However, in this situation if I was in her shoes I don\u2019t think this would cause an extra mental load as long as my kid had stayed overnight with the person a few times and knew their routine and as long as my partner didn\u2019t drink and was the one still on-call (which OP clarified he would be).", "This. My husband works 4-5 nights a week, so most evenings bedtime routine is on me. However, on the days he is off, we split evening childcare evenly. Not always is the parent off duty going out.

Jesus do none of the people in this thread have a life?", ">You're a shitty father and husband.\n\nWhat the fuck", "Wife also used the term \u201ccover\u201d based on the OP. Why is everyone just picking at him with this argument.", "If he was going to be spending the evening with her, I'd agree. But he stated her bed time (asleep by 7:30) and the time he intends to leave (5 PM). His entire evening with his daughter would be bedtime routine then bed, and he spends the rest of the night sitting alone in his house. Which is totally fine, but don't try to paint this as he's avoiding time with his daughter. He's not. He's missing one bedtime routine.\n\nThe issues here are not about him spending time with his daughter. It's about his wife being resentful of some aspects of their relationship. Something is out of balance childcare wise, but forcing him to stay home when he is able to arrange perfectly acceptable alternative care for the daughter isn't the solution. No body is losing in this situation. But because he's not spending a night home with his daughter, the perceived (and probably real) disparity between OP and his wife remains the same, and her resentment towards it flares up. \n\nOP does need to skip this night, but not because of his daughter. That was all taken care of either way. He needs to skip this night and stay home to appease his wife, to make future convos about the source of this issue much smoother and easier. It will be one less item of fresh resentment to drive her side of the argument, and would probably go a long way to showing he was serious about fixing the actual issues. \n\nWhich I want to be clear, are NOT about him spending time with his daughter. \n\nOh, and he is being punished here. By being made to stay home. The daughter is just a tool to do so. He doesn't seem to mind spending time with his daughter. Nor does he seem to care if he had to stay home if no one could babysit. His problem is, despite his efforts to make everything ok, he's still being told no, for basically no real reason, so it feels like a punishment. This is a very real outcome of being targeted by resentment. His wife might not realize what she's doing, and I doubt it malicious. But the wife's resentment is the problem here. Period.", "100% My thoughts too.\n\nI am a pregnant mother of 2 yo and an introvert without massive social circle. Basically the same as OP\u2019s wife.\n\nBUT when my partner is going out, then I have a day for myself that week too, even if I don\u2019t go out socialising. I will go to movies, or cafe or he goes out with daughter and I have \u201cme time\u201d in our house. And when I go out with friends, HE stays with my daughter not other family member.\n\nAs an introvert I can see how it easier for her to just stay at home then try to arrange childcare with his busy social schedule. And it is not only about socialising, she could\u2019ve had a day of \u201cme time\u201d every week, exactly like OP does, but he obviously doesn\u2019t consider that. Also, I am 100% sure that if one weekend OP said: \u201c You know, I decided not to go out to night and give you some time for yourself instead\u201d I am sure his wife would find things she wanted to do on her own even if it didn\u2019t involve socialising.", ">I don't see the problem\n\nAgreed.  NTA.  \n\n\nOP normally covers for wife when she has plans & he doesn't, but in this one (seemingly rare) case they both have plans on the same night, and OP has a willing family member stepping in to help out.  \n\n\nMost of people saying \"YTA\" seem to imply that OP never takes care of his daughter, which is showing a lack of reading comprehension.  \n\n\nWhen my son was young, we would try and plan our nights out so that one of us was home, and 95% of the time that wasn't a problem.  Occasionally we'd both have plans that were important to us that we couldn't reschedule, and my sister was always more than happy to take our son b/c she LOVED any chance she got for extra time with him.  \n\n\nAbsolutely not a big deal.  OP's wife is making it into an issue when there's no reason to.", "I dont imagine she intends to punish him, but she wants him to do as he's told...", "Adding to this: if you\u2019re gonna arrange childcare for the night like this, do it for a date night and not for a night when both you and your wife are off doing separate things. As parents, the majority of your free time is spent on your kids, so getting time together as a couple is so important. As is time with friends or hobbies, don\u2019t get me wrong, but your wife is your partner, coparent, and teammate, so spending quality time with her should be a slightly greater priority.", "As helpful as the emotional discussion is, I'm going to piggyback and go further on the parent comment's first point:\n\nAbsolutely do not take your babysitter for granted. Even if they genuinely enjoy babysitting now, that will almost certainly change at some point. Don't push your luck, instead save their extremely generous services for occasions when you and your wife want to do something together.", "I would add ( I was coming here to say much the same)I think you need to really think about your lifestyle as a part of this scenario. Have you always gone out so often? Does your wife STILL only want to go out about 6x/yr? Now that you have a young child has it never occurred to you that being out of the house that many nights a week has become a problem for your wife? And then, on one of the infrequent times she has a night out, you STILL couldn\u2019t modify your desires to take care of your child. It doesn\u2019t matter that you made the arrangements you did. It\u2019s the fact that you have no desire to voluntarily spend time CARING (not covering) for your daughter on your own while your wife enjoys a night out- something you do all the time. I mean if you really go out 3x a week that means you spend 156 evenings a year out with your friends. And if your wife only goes out 6x/year that means she\u2019s with your daughter 359 nights out of the year to your 209. (Excluding sleepovers and if we\u2019re just talking your availability to your family during regular days) Does this seem fair to you? And then, on one night where she wants to be able to go out, you still refuse to care for your daughter and arrange a sleepover instead. No wonder she\u2019s upset. And let\u2019s be clear- taking care of your child as its parent should never feel like you are being punished. If it does that is an indication that your priorities are not straight and you should look into that. Now that you\u2019re a father, your focus should be on your family not gaming. And I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t go out. But you might need to rethink the frequency.", "This is the part that would get me if I were the wife. Unless he regularly schedules childcare for the sake of taking her on a date, then he's undeniably an asshole here. He'll deal with finding a babysitter if he can go see the boys, but is he doing the same to spend quality time with his wife?", "That\u2019s assuming and you don\u2019t know that.", "This should be higher up.", "Eh, I don't know if it's that I hate asking people for favors or if it's a mom guilt thing (I rarely experience mom guilt) but I HATE asking people to watch my child and try to limit it as much as possible to the times it's absolutely necessary. Depending on the dynamics of the sleepovers, that might be the carer asking for the kids to stay over instead of the parents asking them to watch. It is different. My husband never seems to have this issue. I actually got really frustrated at him the other day, because I had a medical procedure that he needed to drive me to, daycare was closed, and he was desperately trying to find someone to watch our son. In my view, it was not a big deal to watch our child at the doctor's office (I would have done it if the situation was reversed). In his view, he absolutely wanted me to have someone watch our son during his medical procedure so I wouldn't have to watch him. We just view the whole situation differently. It's far more stressful for me to find a sitter than watch and entertain him in public. It's far more stressful for him to watch and entertain our child in public than it is to find a sitter (that might sound bad, but I also get it, kid's little and he gets into things and gets loud).", "Since he isn\u2019t specifying that this is his sibling/cousin/etc. he is asking, it sure seems as though he may also be using up one of HER favors with her sister etc. for HIS night. Family favor exchange can be a delicate balance, and if this is her family of origin, she may still be the one who repays it. \n\nAND: Maybe she also doesn\u2019t want to push people to the max of what feels comfy and easy to do right before they have a second child and they will need more support. \n\nAND AND: It\u2019s just different to all be hanging out together and to put the child to bed in that context, vs. asking for a babysitting favor. \n\nSheesh. At first I thought this dude was reasonable but now I think he is just really pushy. I mean it\u2019s ok he brought it up as an idea, but now he\u2019s arguing it as an issue of what\u2019s reasonable even after she\u2019s made it clear what she needs and wants for a rare night out.

Suburbs are a historical abnormality and raising a child in the isolation of them should be considered child abuse in my opinion, having grown up in them.\n\nFolks are definitely reading a lot in that isn't there to sling hate, it's absolutely wild, I mean the sole point of staying home here is because your wife thinks you shouldn't spend time with friends, she's covered as you said, she's not missing anything, and in no way affected so why that should result in you becoming more cut off I just can't understand.

So OP\u2019s wife gave birth somewhere in the neighborhood of 24 months ago.

So 90% of the time that I saw them, it was just easier for us to go over and have coffee at their house rather than going out for an evening. So her time being social have probably been even less frequent than they were she didn\u2019t have a child. Meanwhile, OP has been having at least weekly outings or video game sessions with friends, and hangouts with another friend group every other month. The friend group that he\u2019s complaining about missing a birthday party for he just saw last month. I would be more on his side if this was some friend coming in town that he never gets the chance to see, it\u2019s been over a year, if not more, and it\u2019s uncertain when the opportunity to see this friend would come up again. That is not the case here. The fact that it\u2019s a birthday party is doesn\u2019t change the equation.

When the child is not at home with a parent, the moms feel like they still have to be \u201con\u201d as a parent. It\u2019s the constant checking of the phone to make sure they did not miss a call or a text from the babysitter. It\u2019s the fact that when daughter stays with his family member, likely his wife is the one that is the primary to respond to questions and she will be the one to get the call if anything happens. She likely now won\u2019t drink if she wanted to have a drink, so that she can be prepared to be responsible if she gets a call that something happened. OP I believe already said that he planned on just having a couple of drinks at the party, and I am sure OP knows that. Two-year-old frequently get sick and stomach bugs for a myriad of reasons, and they\u2019re constantly toddling and bumping into things. Having to go pick up a child because they started throwing up or take them to the hospital to check out an injury is not an unusual occurrence in two-year-olds. So what was at first a plan where wife would be able to go out and relax with her friends, she now can\u2019t. \n\nWife barely has outings like this with friends. I imagine it has been months at least since she has gotten together like this with her friends. The friend group that OP is talking about he saw literally last month, and he says he sees them at least every two months on top of having weekly hang outs and video game sessions with his other friend group. That\u2019s a lot of socializing for a parent and way more socializing that than many people that aren\u2019t parents often see a lot of their friends because of other life commitments.

Secondly, he stated HE was going to coordinated prep, drop off, point of contact, and pick up in the morning so she didnt have to worry at all.

And presumably they are both drinking then, probably engaging in extracurricular activities as well. \n\nSo it makes zero sense that she could relax enough to go on an intimate outing with her husband, presumably have sex while they're at it, but not be able to relax with her friends. Last time i checked, intimacy requires a significantly larger amount of relaxation to work effectively. \n\nShe is literally punishing him (not by making him care for his own child) by being resentful that he goes out with friends more than she does.

When husband gets home, he often times plays video games with his friends from 5pm-9pm with a small break for dinner. He does also makes dinner about 4 nights a week. But he only feeds our son dinner and puts him to bed on Fridays. Every other day, I'm the one feeding our son breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. I'm the one who puts him down for naps and for bed. I'm the one who changes all the diapers and changes his clothes. \n\nThe choice for me to be a SAHM was the right choice. I would have missed out on my son growing up because I worked overnight and slept all day. And I would have only been making about $50 a week after we paid for daycare while still adding a lot of daily miles and use to my car. I don't have a problem taking care of the household chores and our son during the day. That's equivalently my job while my husband works out of the house. I just wish he would help parent a little more during the evenings and weekends. \n\nAdd in the fact that I feel like I parent my 11yo stepson more than he does, too. I sat down with him to figure out his math homework last night. He has a lot of lessons (maybe 5 questions each. He just needs to DO them) that he needs to make up because he has lied to us about having homework for weeks. His teacher only just reached out to us early this week. When he got home, I asked for husband's help because kiddo was being a PITA about just doing the homework, and he said he needed to get changed and go to the bathroom first. By the time he was done with that 30 minutes later, I had finally managed to corral kiddo into finishing one lesson. Husband said he needed to do 20 minutes of math work each night to get caught up, and that was it.

Op says that they already use childcare somewhat frequently, but is missing the fact that they are currently using the childcare when it benefits both husband and wife!!! \n\nRegardless of how OP sees it, I can guarantee that his wife, as the primary childcare, understands that\u2019s someone else watching the child is a significant burden, and she undoubtedly \u201csaves\u201d the opportunity for childcare, and looks forward to those times, all whilst feeling a little guilty every time someone else is watching her child. \n\nBy OP refusing to step up and instead passing off childcare, he is in fact using childcare from what is a limited joint pool meant for him AND his wife. If he uses childcare for this birthday party, will his wife feel comfortable asking for a break next week? Will they get that date night they may both really need? Using childcare when it clearly is just benefitting OP is selfish.", "> If your wife is unhappy with the arrangement, I suspect that it's a much bigger issue than this single event.\n\nIt's definitely bigger than this one single event.

It's a bit hard to tell without being in their lives if this is unhealthy resentment from her (i.e.: he needs to deprive himself because she's deprived herself) or if she's fed up with him always finding a way out of childcare (and maybe doesn't make the same effort to find a sitter when it's for her).", "Yes. This is the correct response. OP whenever you want to go out, your wife has your back. You hang out with friends six times a month, and your wife is always there for you and your kid. But the ONE TIME she wants to go out, you suddenly have to bail and can\u2019t stay home. It doesn\u2019t matter that you arranged for a babysitter. Your wife doesn\u2019t arrange a babysitter six times a month to cover all the times you go out, and if she did I bet you wouldn\u2019t be happy about it because at some level you know that staying with the sitter it\u2019s not the same as your kid being home in their own bed under the care of a parent.

Yes, both parents get to go out, but the wife is clearly not comfortable with asking the aunt to pick up more child care hours. Aunt already gives a lot of time to watch the kids (and I take OP at their word that aunt enjoys this time, and was happy to watch their daughter this time as well), but baby #2 is on the way. \n\nThe aunt is soon going to transition from watching one kid for a few hours thrice a week (and a kid that seems well behaved based on OP's confidence that she sleeps through the night and that once bedtime happens the night is over) to watching 2 kids. 2 kids vs one is usually more than doubling the amount of energy required, and there's a real risk that the baby will be significantly more hands on than current daughter.\n\nThis arrangement needs to last for *years*. Aunt watches kids when neither parent can due to work, and that's not likely to change. So this aunt is a massively important resource that will enable their life style for probably the next 4-5 years at a minimum.  If the aunt ever winds up not wanting to spend her time watching kids, it's going to take significant sacrifices to replace her. \n\nThe wife clearly feels bothered about asking the aunt to do more. We don't know why that is, could be she's worried aunt will change their mind down the line, could be she doesn't think the aunt enjoys it as much as she professes, it could be she's completely misreading the situation and the aunt is happy to watch now and forever and that source of familial good will will never be overtapped. \n\nRegardless, the wife clearly has concerns over how much the aunt is helping, and a solution that doesn't address those concerns isn't a solution where everyone wins. It's possible the wife's concerns are unfounded and she's asking OP to stay home when it wouldn't be a problem that he goes out, but it's also possible the concerns have basis and they risk losing a critical resource of their current life style, or at least souring the wife's relationship with somebody OP described as \"like her second mom\".

Your wife doesn't want to punish you, but she probably is thinking \"for once, he'll be the one to put her to bed while I'm out. He'll be alone with her. He'll feed her and take care of her while I'm the one away.\"\n\nIf I had to guess, she wants to see that effort from you for her sake. It's a gift to take care of your kid, but she's probably feeling a bit like you weaseled out of it, or sought an excuse to avoid this responsibility.\n\nI'm not saying that's what you did. I'm not saying she's right for thinking it either. But that would be my personal best guess as to what's going on.\n\nOP, satisefy my curiosity, do you spend a decent amount of 1 on 1 time with your kid? Without mom around?", "I want and need this.

As someone who's basically always had a recurring Thing in my life since becoming an adult (be it fighting game tournaments, dnd night, tennis), i couldnt imagine dating someone who also doesnt have a hobby in that sense.\n\nAlso going to a metal show next week solo and kinda stoked about it lol", "Just wanted to say that that\u2019s a really interesting theory and I\u2019d be very interested to read more if you ever flesh it out!!", "OP smacks of D&D rather than frat party honestly.", "This is the first honest comment on her behalf. I still think it's petty because it shouldn't be about keeping score, but at least it's honest.", "YTA: This is simple. You passed on caring for your daughter in favor of socializing with your \u201csecond\u201d friend group. You tell your wife \u201cDon\u2019t worry honey. I\u2019ve got it covered. Dear Daughter will be with Family Friend!\u201d What your wife heard is \u201cI\u2019d prefer fun with my friends than bonding with my Dear Daughter\u201d. You\u2019re also telling your wife your friends are more important than your daughter. \n\nYour social life is far more active than 99 percent of other parents. By your own admission, you socialize with friends ~58 times a year, in contrast to your wife\u2019s ~6. Multiply that by the number of hours per social outing and the imbalance in the amount of time you spend caring for your daughter vs. your wife is significant. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to spend more time with her. You might even like it.", "Soft YTA\n\nthis isnt about logic, its about fairness. You get to go out constantly while she takes care of your child, meaning that she does more of the childcare than you do (at least time wise). How fair is it for you to get to go out constantly while she only gets a few nights? And if you add in the fact that your having someone else cover for you, its even more unfair. \nShe does want you to stay home, but not as punishment. She wants you to stay home because its the fair thing to do, for you to understand and empathize with what she goes through every week. Its not punishment, its just fair.", "Imagine for a moment that this wasn't about babysitting, but instead about dinner preparation. Imagine that your wife makes a home-cooked meal 80% of the time, and when she can't, you do. Then she asks you to cover for her, you agree, but then your friend's birthday party comes up and you decide to order pizza instead. Everybody gets fed, right? Yes, but one of those two options is literally \"phoning it in\". The two options require two very different levels of investment. She doesn't need to ask you to phone in a pizza order. She could have done that herself. So, if she is upset, it's probably because you are demonstrating that you are unwilling to put in the same level of investment that she does, day in and day out, even though she only asks you rarely. I am sure you love your daughter, but on this particular day you are demonstrating that your friends are more important to you than your daughter. You should look up \"default parent\". I am guessing your wife is the default parent. I am the default parent in my family. It's exhausting. Default parents carry more of the load even when both parents are home. When the child is upset, they can sometimes completely ignore the other parent and only be soothed by the default. It is a huge burden. I think when she sees how many times she has to sacrifice so you can go out with your friends, versus you not willing to make the same sacrifice, it can cause resentment and make your wife feel like she is alone in all of this and unsupported by you. What you initially called \"punishment\" is reminds me of that saying, when all you've known is privilege, equality feels like oppression. Raising young children takes a lot of effort, there's just no getting around it. But raising them gets easier as they get older and soon enough they will be embarrassed to be seen in public with you. So, enjoy your time with your kids while you can!", "Info: when is the last time you spent quality one on one time with your child (aka without your wife there)? And by quality, I mean you actually hangout together for multiple hours. Not just \u201cwatch the kid\u201d while your wife is running a few errands. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s been at least multiple months. I\u2019d be annoyed too if my husband had a rare opportunity to spend one on one time with our child and decided to hangout with friends instead.", "Your wife isn't \"punishing\" you, she's expecting you to act like a parent and to take care of your child. You can't just call on the sitter every single time something fun unexpectedly comes up. Especially when they already watch her 3x a week. \n\nUnless my inlaws are busy, they wouldn't hesitate to take our son if we needed them to. But we only call on them for important things and do our best not to take advantage. Especially when they will take him for the weekend once or twice a month. Not because we need them to but so that he can bond with them. \n\nI would have said NAH because I do understand wanting to spend time with friends you don't get to see very often and how tempting it is to call on the sitter. However, I am giving you TA judgement because of your accusation concerning your wife, how bitter you're being, and the fact that you came to reddit expecting everyone to tell you that your wife is jealous and that you're in the right.", "YTA. I\u2019m currently in a similar situation. I made plans with my bff for their birthday on the 21st and notified husband yesterday. Husband has plans the 20th so it should\u2019ve worked out that I stay home with kiddo Friday and he stay home Saturday. Well now he\u2019s wanting to go help his cousin work on his boat Saturday, which normally I would be OK with but he had a habit of staying later with the cousin bc they start playing guitar and lose track of time. I\u2019m frustrated bc my husband goes out ALL THE TIME between band practice and shows and the one time I plan something, he also has something come up that hinders my plan and he doesn\u2019t allow for room for MY night out.

It\u2019s definitely something along the lines of me always staying home when he goes out, so I think that it\u2019s fair that he stays home when I go out. Again, when I say it out loud, it doesn\u2019t sound very fair.", "The fact that you made plans AFTER knowing your wife already had plans and then decided that her time off isn\u2019t as important as your time off, you dump you daughter onto a family member to skater YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!! \n\nTotal AH move, congratulations on making your wife feel like her away time is valued and that she is respected in the marriage.", "YTA if you didn't want to be a parent, you shouldn't have had a child.

You might be putting undue emotional stress on her for your convenience. \n\nI think what you meant with the whole \"punishment\" thing is maybe your wife is feeling that you aren't ready to make the same sacrifices for her that she has been making for you.
