Everyone has a cellphone nowadays, if you don\u2019t have the courtsey to check if its OK with them first, them YTA, every time. Just don\u2019t do it!  If she wanted you there she would have extended an invite. She didn\u2019t, so don\u2019t show up unannounced. Ever.\n\nThis was more about making yourself look and feel good. Why must you have dropped off a car decoration, while she is sick?", "ESH but mostly the mom. \n\nDon\u2019t show up to someone\u2019s house unannounced unless you have some sort of permanent invite. \n\nMom blowing things out of proportion like this is a huge red flag. If you continue this relationship, be ready to deal with some *bullshit* from her indefinitely.", "Very soft YTA, but only because I think you may have just made a bad judgment call to show up without asking if it's okay first. \n\nIt sounds like there may be something else behind her being frustrated. Perhaps going over unannounced after only being together for a month isn't the right play. She did say she wasn't feeling well, after all. For me, I can't stand when people come over unannounced even when I've known them for years -- let alone someone I've only been together with for a month. It might come off as possessive, or like you're developing a dependency issue -- not that I think you are. I am just stating what the other person might be thinking. \n\nThat said, definitely not cool of her mom to exaggerate (assuming you're being fully truthful) the nature of the door knocking. That said, I would carefully examine whether or not your knocks could have been interpreted as being bigger than you think they were. It's possible that what you thought were small knocks were actually huge bangs. It wouldn't be the first time someone misjudged their movements. \n\nEither way though, I think that you have some things to think about. Hopefully you guys can figure it out and move forward.", "Mild \"you're the asshole\". You obviously wanted to do well but next time just don't go visit someone if they are not feeling well unless they ask you to. The mom is ridiculously paranoid but nonetheless you should apologize.\n\nEdit: oh so you did apologize and they didn't accept it. Then this is ESH as they're being assholes as well. Best to move on OP, you don't want to deal with such a mentally unstable mom.", "NTA - You two have been seeing each other for a month right? I can understand wanting a heads up before visiting but there are mature adult ways to handle that conversation. It seems like her mother doesn\u2019t like you at all and will definitely cause issues in this relationship. Have you taken the time to talk to your GF about this? Does she agree with her mother and not accept your apology?", "NTA but after 1 month I\u2019d feel smothered if you did that\u2026 not long enough of a relationship imo - you prob aren\u2019t even official yet?", "YTA. You coulda texted her letting her know that you wanted to come over. After a month, you're not at \"randomly show up\" territory yet. Mom doesn't know who you are, even. And why the gift? A Halloween gift is kinda weird. And it's not even Halloween yet either.", "Unfortunately, YTA.  \n\n\nAt best, you're socially tone deaf.  At worst, you don't trust her and/or wanted to try and \"buy\" her affection with acts of service.  \n\n\nToo much/too soon/too pushy and clingy.", "Your story gets sketchier the further it goes along.\n\nYou've been dating only a month. Your being concern over her health is considerate, but she lives with her mother so your intervention is not really needed. You didn't let them know you were going to drop by and see how she was feeling.\n\nNew relationship, clearly un-needed help, un-announced, after dark adds up to YTA.\n\nLeaving a wreath is just weird and belies your claim of spontaneity.", "Writings on the wall bud.. she\u2019s not into you. She\u2019s gas lighting you.  \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t feel safe in her house anymore\u201d.  That\u2019s bs.  She\u2019s icked by you and i think you probably know it that\u2019s why you went to her house.", "I think in this day and age with phones and the fact you've only been together a month, YTA. What were you hoping for? To catch her in a lie or expose yourself to germs?", "NTA, but you could've texted just to make sure.\nAlso, be wary of the mother, she seems kinda odd (trying to be as polite as possible)", "YTA there is no reason to show up an anyone's unannounced. You simply text your GF and ask if she's up for a quick visit and when she doesn't answer because she's asleep you know not to go over. It's not even about how hard or soft you knocked. It's jarring to have an unexpected knock on your door.", "YTA, yall too clingy for me after only dating 1 month and some change. Just ask her if she needs anything and that you are willing to bring it to her.", "NTA\n\nYou showed up wanting to take care of her and be a good boyfriend, even bringing a gift. \n\nMoreover, she's a grown ass 30 year old woman. \"Mom is upset and doesn't feel safe\" that's bullshit.\n\nI don't believe that excuse. And if it is actually true....huge over reaction. Even if it was 8 or 9pm that's not super late or unreasonable imo in this specific situation.\n\nHonestly, I'd start to consider walking away because it's only been a month, but wait on your gf to address what happened. If it's not good, don't argue or fight and just leave and block.", "Nta - ppl here are dumb that was very nice and thoughtful u knocked and left", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t show up at anyone\u2019s home without permission if they have already told you they don\u2019t feel good.\n\neta \u2014 just apologize.

Own it, apologize & move on with your life.", "Pobrecito.. it\u2019s time to move on buddy.  You will eventually build enough experience to tell when the spark or chemistry is fading and this is 100% a clear sign of it.  Move on", "I guess we live in a different time where checking in on a partner is frowned upon because it was unannounced. \n\nNTA for doing that. SOFT YTA since it\u2019s the mothers house and maybe she would\u2019ve appreciated a heads up, despite her actions and attitude afterwards.", "tell her sorry but you gotta go because her moms a liar.", "Ask your girlfriend how she\u2019d like you to handle visits or stop bys in the future. If her mother has some issues she may prefer you only come by with an explicit invitation. \n\nI understand you texted but you didn\u2019t receive a response. Next time I wouldn\u2019t show up without acknowledgement it\u2019s ok.", "Get out of that", "[deleted]", "Yes definitely. No matter what it is rude to come announced especially when someone else is there in the house. Anyways you had good intentions so it should be ok. But don\u2019t do it next time for sure.", "Hard NTA. The people commenting that you're somehow overstepping or being a creep all come off as bitter. If that's a boundary your gf would like to set then fine, but guilting you for her mom's delusions is too much. The mom is weirdly paranoid and clearly wants to cause issues between you two", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice thing, and mother is blowing it up. I would guess it's either because (1) she doesn't like you (or maybe doesn't like anyone her daughter dates) and is using this as an excuse, or (2) she is just a paranoid person who is going to react like this.\n\nOne thought: is it possible that someone else DID bang on the door at 10 or after? Given the sequence you describe, if that happened, they could have reasonably thought it was you, since they found the wreath from you in the morning.", "YTA. \n\nSaying she lets her phone die when you didn\u2019t even try to reach her is irrelevant. Saying you\u2019ve been over there later *when invited* is also irrelevant. \n\nIf seeing if she needed anything is really the purpose, logic says contact her first, so you can bring what she needs. Otherwise you\u2019re coming and going twice and it *is* getting late for someone who feels crappy. \n\nBottom line\u2026your story doesn\u2019t add up and neither does theirs. \n\nMaybe their reaction is a distrust reaction; maybe it\u2019s projection as she didn\u2019t really feel lousy and/or she\u2019s up to something. \n\nRegardless, you overstepped\u2014and worsened things by not owning it.", "YTA. After a month she's not your girlfriend. Her mom probably thinks you're creepy.", "NTA\n\nMy wife still talks about the times when we were dating where I\u2019d drop her off soup when she was sick or flowers/gifts when she wasn\u2019t. Maybe find a girl with a family who appreciates that kind of kindness\u2026", "yta, would you like if I banged on your door at 9pm?", "Have you heard the complaint straight from her mother?\n\nAny chance she is gaslighting you into thinking you made something bad and just to induce you not to go to her place because she might not want you around the house at a specific time because of whatever reason?\n\nA lot of people are shit at communicating and are afraid to straight up say what are their thoughts and feelings. From the little info I have from the situation I would guess she has some reason to hold her privacy very well preserved, and you going there breaks this privacy needs and it sounds like this situation became somewhat aggressive just to protect this privacy without having to go into the details.\n\nTalk to her, to her mom. Understand their point of view in the transgression and make sure that you change whatever needs to be changed to fulfill their needs if you wish to. Also, make sure that the reasons make sense and you are not just being pushed over by mad people.\n\nI would say NTA as you had good intentions, but I can see how she would view you as the asshole.

Late night sick day drop ins are a different type of intimacy that should be developed over time in my opinion", "NTA, but her mom is and I would suspect she has a ulterior motive like she doesn\u2019t want her to move out and take her money with her something along those lines she\u2019s cutting you off or trying to. Keep your distance from the mother she\u2019s a sociopath. Not sure I would not want to continue relationship with her if she is gonna continue berating you over her psychotic mother before you have to much invested in the relationship.", "NTA. \n\nNice of you to check on her. I would have called or texted first. It would give you a time stamp against the 10 pm lie. \n\nI wish you luck. Based on this, her mom sounds dramatic if she\u2019s met you a few times before.", "How did the mother know it was him knocking? This sounds like a potential stalker who, apparently, was told by the girlfriend that she did not want to see him but he went there anyway. Him describing his tapping on the door is a real indicator of someone defending himself before telling us what he was accused of. The girl needs to get out now.", "NTA, her mom is a big one for lying and being so fragile that a few knocks on a door make her feel unsafe.", "NTA; mental health is genetically inherited, consider this a preview and get out now.", "I had a girlfriend who told me she was sick once. I came to her house with flowers and soup. De broke up with me the following week.\n\nTake a hint and stay away, but NTA", "NTA and her mom needs help.", "Yea get out while you can", "NTA. Her mum sounds a little nuts tbh. You sound nice and thoughtful", "Dude, no woman wants you knocking on their door at that time ESPECIALLY UNANNOUNCED! Do you even know the world we live in?", "Clearly NTA, as you have stated in comments, her phone dies sometimes and you tried texting and calling her, 8:40 isn\u2019t too late to stop by and check on her.

You are no where near the level of uninvited drop ins.", "Did the mom relate all this to you or is the gf the one giving you all this info. Seems more like she was probably getting banged by someone else while you were \"banging\" on the door and needed a story to not only redirect attention, but also discourage you from coming over to check on her anymore.", "Sounds like you pissed off her other boyfriend and not her mother", "Nta but talk with your gf about how you'll handle unannounced visits in the future. Maybe she don't like that or her mother don't want it. I just don't open the door when nobody announced themselves.

It seems like you have a level of understanding with the gf, and texted beforehand.. you dropped off the gift with no expectations and then left, you weren\u2019t pushing to see her or being aggressive. This is all very harmless. It sounds like the Mom was triggered and then refused to see any facts of what happened; there\u2019s nothing you can really do about that and I don\u2019t think you have to, besides being clear with your gf.", "YTA \n\nDating a month? And showing up unannounced at night? Way too soon for that to be considered sweet.

If so, YTA. Not cool.", "I would tell your girlfriend you're sorry to have caused an upset, clarify that you were there at 8:41, and say you'll message first in future.\n\nThat makes you the bigger/better person. (You didn't do anything wrong. But apologising for the result of your actions/feelings caused is always a good move. Always.)\n\nThen, if you end up in this relationship long term, learn to expect trouble from the mother and come up with a plan on how you're going to deal with it.", "Are you all insane? these N T A are crazy. YTA. Don\u2019t stop by unannounced, especially after dark. Stop bys can be really unsettling and scary for women. She was sick. If anything, leave the gift without knocking.

The mother is always kinda there when we get there and leave she says hi to me and bye to me with some small talk but otherwise nothing in depth. I stated in another comment on here she doesn\u2019t keep her phone charged and will let it die so I did text and call with no answer and my only thought was what\u2019s the harm in stopping by. I did apologize I should say and it was not accepted.", "Well. It just worked out that way. I had to buy something for work (own my own business) and had to go a good distance away for the first one and she ended up asking to tag along so we turned it into a trip. We just ended up doing things like that and turned them into little vacations. It\u2019s a convenience thing I guess and it made the trips each of us had to do abit fun. Not like a cruise or anything along those lines.", "I stopped to check on her because of being sick. People I care about I check in on. The decoration she asked me to buy her so I left it on the porch where the other decorations just sitting on the chair. It was just an extra thing I wasn\u2019t there because of the gift thing.", "I apologized. The mother said it was not accepted.", "Crazy take since the mom is lying about when OP was there (he has time stamps to back his story from both texts and his ring camera) and is also likely lying about the noise level. Additionally, it's a little extra to feel unsafe in your home because someone knocked on your door. I would hate to see what would happen if someone rings her doorbell.", "We haven\u2019t really had any other conversation about it. My GF said that my apology doesn\u2019t fix how her mothers going to be for the next two weeks and all she\u2019s going to hear is her mothers complaining.

For those people I just have to start telling stories and I get a response like \"Yup. That's my mom, and I need to stop talking about this.\"", "I love a good visual, especially a Venn diagram :)\nhttps://assets.cureus.com/uploads/figure/file/232496/lightbox_d186a100d62411eb85e63d36828e151a-Cureus-Figure-1-Jack.png", "Yes I have. Since you\u2019re presuming something about someone and then assigning their negative traits to everyone with a certain mental health disorder, I\u2019m going to assume that you are extremely biased towards people with bpd and that you aren\u2019t as educated about and understanding of bpd as you\u2019d like to believe. Just like every other Redditor that posts this \u201csounds like they have bpd\u201d bs on every post where someone is acting irrational and/abusive. It\u2019s nothing new. \n\nAnd you acting like you know so much about bpd because you assume someone, who obviously refused to actually get help and get diagnosed, has it and because you read some books, is the same thing every other person who acts this way on Reddit does. \n\nBpd is extremely misunderstood by people. Even some therapists, to the point where people who actually want to get help are looked down on by people who are supposed to be professional. And you going around thinking you somehow understand it more than people who actually live with it, and putting that label on anyone who acts irrational just makes that worse. \n\nI have bad experiences with someone who has adhd. She abused me and then would gaslight me and try to say she didn\u2019t, that I was crazy and I belong in a mental hospital. And yes she did really hit me and yes she did really gaslight me, she admitted to it and other people were there. So by my own experience people with adhd are abusive and gaslighters. Should I read some books from other people that agree with my bias now so I can confirm that? Then would that entitled me to go and comment on every post where someone is being abusive and gaslighting someone with \u201csounds like they have adhd\u201d? No. Because that would be just as ridiculous as what you\u2019re doing. \n\nYou had a bad experience with someone who you think has bpd. That doesn\u2019t mean that everyone who acts that way has bpd. The person you have that bad experience with can just be a bad person that happens to have bpd. Just like someone can be a bad person and also have adhd. Or be a bad person and also be a certain race. Or have a certain disability. If you wouldn\u2019t go around assuming that every bad person was that way because of any other characteristics about them, why do you do it with a very difficult to have mental health disorder? \n\nAlso the person you have that bad experience with might not even have bpd! So you\u2019re making assumptions about others based on something you don\u2019t even know is true and don\u2019t even understand. Just because Reddit accepts it doesn\u2019t make it ok! Be better. \n\nBpd is extremely hard to have. There\u2019s a reason why people with this disorder are up there in the \u201cmore likely to commit suicide\u201d category. Have some compassion. Some of us are having a hard enough time as it is, doing the best we can and trying to do better and heal. And going on Reddit, constantly seeing people like you assigning the bpd label to anyone who seems \u201ccrazy\u201d or irrational or abusive isn\u2019t helpful at all. \n\nAnd work on yourself. It sounds like you\u2019ve gone through a lot of trauma. Work on healing instead of putting it on everyone with bpd. Stop pushing a very harmful stigma.", "Lol huh? She didn\u2019t want to see him. I said it\u2019s not a huge deal, chock it up to life lesson and move on. Just as I\u2019m going to do now. Adios", "My sister and I kinda took it at the time as we were totally duped into believing that we were just an annoyance. Years on its funny to reflect how ridiculous some of the crap we went through was!", "My ex was absolutely crazy = Don't date me\n\nAlthough obviously everyone is speaking sort of informally online so it is possible that in a *serious* conversation you'd get a more judicious explanation of what the problems were. Barring serious abuse most people wouldn't blame their ex for everything, since, even if they sucked, there were probably mistakes made on both sides. (\"I was totally cool and she was not chill\" isn't generally going to be an accurate depiction of a relationship or breakup, even people who fully feel their ex was more wrong don't simply say that)", "Well your opinion sucks, the way this comments reads is that when they were in a relationship she had undiagnosed personality disorders", "This her?", "Thank you! :)", "> That's my mom, and I need to stop talking about this.\"\n\nwait, why?", "I didn't say everyone with BPD has this, sweetie.\n\nAnd the books I've read were pretty comprehensive.\n\nYou aren't listening.\n\nI'm glad you asked, I didn't make an assumption, I said you WOULDN'T know if you haven't.\n\nAnd please someone research.\nBPD is \"rare\" but the trouble.with diagnosing it is that it has SO MANY manifestations (again, your statement that people with BPD don't invent stuff is wrong. YOU don't. My mom does.)\nAlso, it's frequently *misdiagnosed* as something else (in other words, plenty of people that DO seek help don't know that's what they have)\n\nAND LITERALLY, therapists who know they have someone with BPD or NPD that didn't arrive open to the discussion have to find ways to break through their denial and resistance. They have literal specialized courses for therapists on how to do this, it's not part of their standard, unless they seek it out.\n\nI haven't invented any of this, kiddo. I researched it, and double checked my facts (and the sources they were pulled from.)\n\nSeriously. Google is your friend.\n\nI don't believe people with mental health issues of any kind should be stigmatized AND it does no one any favors, including yourself, to pretend that actual possible.manufestations of the disease are invented by someone to be malicious, or because someone hurt them.\n\nPlease, go look these things up.\n\nGoogle \"disassociation and BPD\"\nGoogle \"disassociation and false memory\"\nGoogle \"why is BPD hard to diagnose\".\n\nI *hear* that my experience doesn't apply to you.\nThat doesn't make me wrong. \nAnd again, well done on GETTING a diagnosis and being willing to seek treatment. That shit is hard, and it's critical to having healthy relationships.", "> She didn\u2019t want to see you. You showed up. That\u2019s not respecting her boundary."]}
