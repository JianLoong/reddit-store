I really do appreciate all of the input.", "YTA\u2026NEVER show up to ANYONE\u2019s house unannounced. Everyone has a cellphone nowadays, if you don\u2019t have the courtsey to check if its OK with them first, them YTA, every time. Just don\u2019t do it!  If she wanted you there she would have extended an invite. She didn\u2019t, so don\u2019t show up unannounced. Ever.\n\nThis was more about making yourself look and feel good. Why must you have dropped off a car decoration, while she is sick?", "ESH but mostly the mom. \n\nDon\u2019t show up to someone\u2019s house unannounced unless you have some sort of permanent invite. \n\nMom blowing things out of proportion like this is a huge red flag. If you continue this relationship, be ready to deal with some *bullshit* from her indefinitely.", "Very soft YTA, but only because I think you may have just made a bad judgment call to show up without asking if it's okay first. \n\nIt sounds like there may be something else behind her being frustrated. Perhaps going over unannounced after only being together for a month isn't the right play. She did say she wasn't feeling well, after all. For me, I can't stand when people come over unannounced even when I've known them for years -- let alone someone I've only been together with for a month. It might come off as possessive, or like you're developing a dependency issue -- not that I think you are. I am just stating what the other person might be thinking. \n\nThat said, definitely not cool of her mom to exaggerate (assuming you're being fully truthful) the nature of the door knocking. That said, I would carefully examine whether or not your knocks could have been interpreted as being bigger than you think they were. It's possible that what you thought were small knocks were actually huge bangs. It wouldn't be the first time someone misjudged their movements. \n\nEither way though, I think that you have some things to think about. Hopefully you guys can figure it out and move forward.", "Mild \"you're the asshole\". You obviously wanted to do well but next time just don't go visit someone if they are not feeling well unless they ask you to. The mom is ridiculously paranoid but nonetheless you should apologize.\n\nEdit: oh so you did apologize and they didn't accept it. Then this is ESH as they're being assholes as well. Best to move on OP, you don't want to deal with such a mentally unstable mom.", "NTA - You two have been seeing each other for a month right? I can understand wanting a heads up before visiting but there are mature adult ways to handle that conversation. It seems like her mother doesn\u2019t like you at all and will definitely cause issues in this relationship. Have you taken the time to talk to your GF about this? Does she agree with her mother and not accept your apology?", "NTA but after 1 month I\u2019d feel smothered if you did that\u2026 not long enough of a relationship imo - you prob aren\u2019t even official yet?", "YTA. You coulda texted her letting her know that you wanted to come over. After a month, you're not at \"randomly show up\" territory yet. Mom doesn't know who you are, even. And why the gift? A Halloween gift is kinda weird. And it's not even Halloween yet either.", "Unfortunately, YTA.  \n\n\nAt best, you're socially tone deaf.  At worst, you don't trust her and/or wanted to try and \"buy\" her affection with acts of service.  \n\n\nToo much/too soon/too pushy and clingy.", "Your story gets sketchier the further it goes along.\n\nYou've been dating only a month. Your being concern over her health is considerate, but she lives with her mother so your intervention is not really needed. You didn't let them know you were going to drop by and see how she was feeling.\n\nNew relationship, clearly un-needed help, un-announced, after dark adds up to YTA.\n\nLeaving a wreath is just weird and belies your claim of spontaneity.", "Writings on the wall bud.. she\u2019s not into you. She\u2019s gas lighting you.  \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t feel safe in her house anymore\u201d.  That\u2019s bs.  She\u2019s icked by you and i think you probably know it that\u2019s why you went to her house.", "I think in this day and age with phones and the fact you've only been together a month, YTA. What were you hoping for? To catch her in a lie or expose yourself to germs?", "NTA, but you could've texted just to make sure.\nAlso, be wary of the mother, she seems kinda odd (trying to be as polite as possible)", "YTA there is no reason to show up an anyone's unannounced. You simply text your GF and ask if she's up for a quick visit and when she doesn't answer because she's asleep you know not to go over. It's not even about how hard or soft you knocked. It's jarring to have an unexpected knock on your door.", "YTA, yall too clingy for me after only dating 1 month and some change. Just ask her if she needs anything and that you are willing to bring it to her.", "NTA\n\nYou showed up wanting to take care of her and be a good boyfriend, even bringing a gift. \n\nMoreover, she's a grown ass 30 year old woman. \"Mom is upset and doesn't feel safe\" that's bullshit.\n\nI don't believe that excuse. And if it is actually true....huge over reaction. Even if it was 10pm that's not super late or unreasonable imo in this specific situation.\n\nHonestly, I'd start to consider walking away because it's only been a month, but wait on your gf to address what happened. If it's not good, don't argue or fight and just leave and block.\n\n(I'd also consider leaving cuz of her mother.)", "Nta - ppl here are dumb that was very nice and thoughtful u knocked and left", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t show up at anyone\u2019s home without permission if they have already told you they don\u2019t feel good.\n\neta \u2014 just apologize.

Own it, apologize & move on with your life.", "Pobrecito.. it\u2019s time to move on buddy.  You will eventually build enough experience to tell when the spark or chemistry is fading and this is 100% a clear sign of it.  Move on", "I guess we live in a different time where checking in on a partner is frowned upon because it was unannounced. \n\nNTA for doing that. SOFT YTA since it\u2019s the mothers house and maybe she would\u2019ve appreciated a heads up, despite her actions and attitude afterwards.", "tell her sorry but you gotta go because her moms a liar.", "Ask your girlfriend how she\u2019d like you to handle visits or stop bys in the future. If her mother has some issues she may prefer you only come by with an explicit invitation. \n\nI understand you texted but you didn\u2019t receive a response. Next time I wouldn\u2019t show up without acknowledgement it\u2019s ok.", "Get out of that", "[deleted]", "Yes definitely. No matter what it is rude to come announced especially when someone else is there in the house. Anyways you had good intentions so it should be ok. But don\u2019t do it next time for sure.", "Hard NTA. The people commenting that you're somehow overstepping or being a creep all come off as bitter. If that's a boundary your gf would like to set then fine, but guilting you for her mom's delusions is too much. The mom is weirdly paranoid and clearly wants to cause issues between you two", "NTA\n\nYou did a nice thing, and mother is blowing it up. I would guess it's either because (1) she doesn't like you (or maybe doesn't like anyone her daughter dates) and is using this as an excuse, or (2) she is just a paranoid person who is going to react like this.\n\nOne thought: is it possible that someone else DID bang on the door at 10 or after? Given the sequence you describe, if that happened, they could have reasonably thought it was you, since they found the wreath from you in the morning.", "YTA. \n\nSaying she lets her phone die when you didn\u2019t even try to reach her is irrelevant. Saying you\u2019ve been over there later *when invited* is also irrelevant. \n\nIf seeing if she needed anything is really the purpose, logic says contact her first, so you can bring what she needs. Otherwise you\u2019re coming and going twice and it *is* getting late for someone who feels crappy. \n\nBottom line\u2026your story doesn\u2019t add up and neither does theirs. \n\nMaybe their reaction is a distrust reaction; maybe it\u2019s projection as she didn\u2019t really feel lousy and/or she\u2019s up to something. \n\nRegardless, you overstepped\u2014and worsened things by not owning it.", "YTA. After a month she's not your girlfriend. Her mom probably thinks you're creepy.", "NTA\n\nMy wife still talks about the times when we were dating where I\u2019d drop her off soup when she was sick or flowers/gifts when she wasn\u2019t. Maybe find a girl with a family who appreciates that kind of kindness\u2026", "yta, would you like if I banged on your door at 10pm?", "Have you heard the complaint straight from her mother?\n\nAny chance she is gaslighting you into thinking you made something bad and just to induce you not to go to her place because she might not want you around the house at a specific time because of whatever reason?\n\nA lot of people are shit at communicating and are afraid to straight up say what are their thoughts and feelings. From the little info I have from the situation I would guess she has some reason to hold her privacy very well preserved, and you going there breaks this privacy needs and it sounds like this situation became somewhat aggressive just to protect this privacy without having to go into the details.\n\nTalk to her, to her mom. Understand their point of view in the transgression and make sure that you change whatever needs to be changed to fulfill their needs if you wish to. Also, make sure that the reasons make sense and you are not just being pushed over by mad people.\n\nI would say NTA as you had good intentions, but I can see how she would view you as the asshole.

Late night sick day drop ins are a different type of intimacy that should be developed over time in my opinion", "NTA, but her mom is and I would suspect she has a ulterior motive like she doesn\u2019t want her to move out and take her money with her something along those lines she\u2019s cutting you off or trying to. Keep your distance from the mother she\u2019s a sociopath. Not sure I would not want to continue relationship with her if she is gonna continue berating you over her psychotic mother before you have to much invested in the relationship.", "NTA. \n\nNice of you to check on her. I would have called or texted first. It would give you a time stamp against the 10 pm lie. \n\nI wish you luck. Based on this, her mom sounds dramatic if she\u2019s met you a few times before.", "How did the mother know it was him knocking? This sounds like a potential stalker who, apparently, was told by the girlfriend that she did not want to see him but he went there anyway. Him describing his tapping on the door is a real indicator of someone defending himself before telling us what he was accused of. The girl needs to get out now.", "NTA, her mom is a big one for lying and being so fragile that a few knocks on a door make her feel unsafe.", "NTA; mental health is genetically inherited, consider this a preview and get out now.", "I had a girlfriend who told me she was sick once. I came to her house with flowers and soup. De broke up with me the following week.\n\nTake a hint and stay away, but NTA", "NTA and her mom needs help.", "Yea get out while you can", "NTA. Her mum sounds a little nuts tbh. You sound nice and thoughtful", "Dude, no woman wants you knocking on their door at that time ESPECIALLY UNANNOUNCED! Do you even know the world we live in?", "Clearly NTA, as you have stated in comments, her phone dies sometimes and you tried texting and calling her, 8:40 isn\u2019t too late to stop by and check on her.

You are no where near the level of uninvited drop ins.", "Did the mom relate all this to you or is the gf the one giving you all this info. Seems more like she was probably getting banged by someone else while you were \"banging\" on the door and needed a story to not only redirect attention, but also discourage you from coming over to check on her anymore.", "Sounds like you pissed off her other boyfriend and not her mother", "Nta but talk with your gf about how you'll handle unannounced visits in the future. Maybe she don't like that or her mother don't want it. I just don't open the door when nobody announced themselves.

You maybe could have said, \"Hey, I have something for you.

It seems like you have a level of understanding with the gf, and texted beforehand.. you dropped off the gift with no expectations and then left, you weren\u2019t pushing to see her or being aggressive. This is all very harmless. It sounds like the Mom was triggered and then refused to see any facts of what happened; there\u2019s nothing you can really do about that and I don\u2019t think you have to, besides being clear with your gf.", "YTA \n\nDating a month? And showing up unannounced at night? Way too soon for that to be considered sweet.

If so, YTA. Not cool.", "I would tell your girlfriend you're sorry to have caused an upset, clarify that you were there at 8:41, and say you'll message first in future.\n\nThat makes you the bigger/better person. (You didn't do anything wrong. But apologising for the result of your actions/feelings caused is always a good move. Always.)\n\nThen, if you end up in this relationship long term, learn to expect trouble from the mother and come up with a plan on how you're going to deal with it.", "Are you all insane? these N T A are crazy. YTA. Don\u2019t stop by unannounced, especially after dark. Stop bys can be really unsettling and scary for women. She was sick. If anything, leave the gift without knocking.

The mother is always kinda there when we get there and leave she says hi to me and bye to me with some small talk but otherwise nothing in depth. I stated in another comment on here she doesn\u2019t keep her phone charged and will let it die so I did text and call with no answer and my only thought was what\u2019s the harm in stopping by. I did apologize I should say and it was not accepted.", "Well. It just worked out that way. I had to buy something for work (own my own business) and had to go a good distance away for the first one and she ended up asking to tag along so we turned it into a trip. We just ended up doing things like that and turned them into little vacations. It\u2019s a convenience thing I guess and it made the trips each of us had to do abit fun. Not like a cruise or anything along those lines.", "I stopped to check on her because of being sick. People I care about I check in on. The decoration she asked me to buy her so I left it on the porch where the other decorations just sitting on the chair. It was just an extra thing I wasn\u2019t there because of the gift thing.", "I apologized. The mother said it was not accepted.", "Crazy take since the mom is lying about when OP was there (he has time stamps to back his story from both texts and his ring camera) and is also likely lying about the noise level. Additionally, it's a little extra to feel unsafe in your home because someone knocked on your door. I would hate to see what would happen if someone rings her doorbell.", "We haven\u2019t really had any other conversation about it. My GF said that my apology doesn\u2019t fix how her mothers going to be for the next two weeks and all she\u2019s going to hear is her mothers complaining.

If the mother really is bipolar or has other issues, your girlfriend is affected by her irrational behaviour as well.", "It's not the gift.  It's the dropping by completely unannounced.  I'm not talking about the gift when I say \"buy\" her affection.  I'm talking about the little surprise visit.  The \"delivery service\" so to speak.\n\nYou've only been dating a month, that's WAAAAAAAAAAY too early for \"just drop by\" actions.  Especially as she's living at home.  \n\n\nETA: Also, you're STILL being tone deaf by not understanding the difference between \"she asked me to buy the gift and picked it out\" and that NOW she's sick and that THAT needs to take center stage for a moment.  I get that you're all excited about the new girlfriend and were probably anxious to see her reaction, and see her, blah blah blah...but you're kind of acting like a puppy, you see?    \n\n\nRelax, step back a bit, try to view this a bit more logically.", "This person was dumped recently my friend", "don't worry it's okay to care about someone", "If she was into you, that phone would be immortal. She probably wants you to get lost but can't say it directly.", "No harm done mate, though as i told you, be wary of the mother", "Why is it so important to you that Mom is wrong & you\u2019re right? What\u2019s your goal?", "Unless you\u2019re a doctor \u2026 Ask first before showing up.", "Gotcha. Back to (1) or (2) above. I'm sorry man. If GF is siding with her mom, I think it's time to move on.", "You're NTA but you need to read the room/ porch. Feels stalkerish to come by unannounced to me. Have some empathy for females and be a gentleman, don't stop by unannounced! If you argue your case further, you need help.", "If you get the chance to speak to the mom maybe to apologize, you can see if their stories line up. If not, then you have found your answers.", "Her brother told me (he\u2019s a nurse) he thinks their mother may be bi polar. But I don\u2019t really like to play into family disputes. He\u2019s mad at his mother so I just thought it was slander.", "Or stupid", "(Stalking can be defined as the willful and repeated following, watching or harassing of another person. Unlike other crimes, which usually involve one act, stalking is a series of actions that occur over a period of time.) I went there unannounced once. That is not stalking by the definition I have just pasted here.", "Not feeling well means not feeling well.  Calm down.  He left a gift for his partner and nowhere does it mention them discussing whether or not he should come.", "Are you trying to lecture them or judge them? Theres aggression here", "Omg why can\u2019t I upvote you more. \n\nThis crazy mother reminds me of mine. She made me scared of the outside world. Literally the movie tangled villain\u2026 it\u2019s sad OP\u2019s GF got pissed cuz of the gaslighting mother.\n\nIf the mom wasn\u2019t present and my bf came in unannounced I\u2019d be so happy to see him\u2026 such a tragic thing for mothers to do this\u2026\n\nOp, you are a great guy. But lesson learn to avoid the mother of you can\u2026 in situations like that :(", "It wasn\u2019t an issue until last night. That\u2019s why it\u2019s bothering me.", "I understand what you mean. Thank you for your input. I really do appreciate it.", "Yeah, wtf is up with the YTA responses? This is why everyone is so distant with each other.\n.", "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a goal. I feel bad and I don\u2019t think I should because the mothers lying. I don\u2019t like when people tell lies about me.", "Why is it so important to you that you\u2019re right and OP\u2019s wrong?", "I think its because if the apology isn't accepted then he has lost his GF. isn't that obvious?", "We'll have to agree to disagree. I think it's sweet, you dont.", "Ya, just kinda sucks because she\u2019s pretty cool on her own. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have talked to her (I like Latinas and she is not, preferences).", "I wasn\u2019t going to do it again. I was at the understanding it was fine which is the only reason I did. If I knew that this was the reaction why would I have done it?", "Not confirmed though. How much does the mom know about you? If your gf even said anything about you to her?", "How old is mom? It could even be dementia..", "Who cares if she\u2019s lying, confused, mentally ill, etc. It\u2019s her home. Now you know the boundaries. You just made a mistake. Not the end of the world.\n\nThe entire world could agree with your actions. If your gf & her Mom do not then your problem is not about stopping by someone\u2019s home unannounced. They don\u2019t trust you.", "My perspective is just an opinion. I will neither be right or wrong. Just like everyone else here.", "That works for you! Great! \n\nI think it\u2019s intrusive & dismissive. I (54f) can advocate for myself if I need something. If I am not feeling well I don\u2019t need company nor do I want to entertain others. That works for me", "I\u2019ve met her mom and spoken to her mother on multiple occasions and on the phone. Her mothers aware of me that\u2019s why she was yelling at my girlfriend \u201cyour boyfriend was here and now I don\u2019t feel safe\u201d is what my GF told me she said to her.", "Her mother is 56", "Or mom may just be drunk \ud83d\ude02", "I don\u2019t disagree with you entirely. I\u2019m really just looking in these comments to see if I\u2019m crazy or if I should run from this situation.", "This is a nonsensical statement. You can absolutely be wrong in a YTA stance. You certainly like letting yourself off the hook with your \u201copinion\u201d whilst condemning the perspective from OP as though they\u2019re two completely different things.", "53M. It's how I was raised. If I show up when you're sick, it's not too be entertained, it's to do things for you.", "And a month in, it sounds like your gf is really comfortable with you. I dont get the \"not safe\" thing. The bipolar diagnosis is pretty plausable, but i still wouldn't hang my hat on it. Me, personally would be ecstatic my bf wanted to check on me, hell itd make my entire day. Im not her, though.", "Not saying that's for sure NOT it.. but seems less likely.. also, mom might not like you then.. I can't see why else she would be blowing something like this up... it was a really sweet gesture.. idk how she could be upset\nEdited to add.: NTA", "Could be a wide range of personality disorders.", "That\u2019s a very good question\u2026 it\u2019s very strange that an apology would not fix this problem. It\u2019s not that big of a deal unless people choose to make it a big deal.\n\nIt definitely appears that gf & Mom are overreacting but without knowing anything but your reporting it\u2019s tough to say whether they are not reasonable people.\n\nEdit", "This is also seems like a nice situation where you should move on. It\u2019s only been a month. Adios.", "No one is condemning anyone. Simply my perspective based on what is being reported. No one here needs to agree with my judgement or even consider it. I\u2019m not arguing with OP or other people\u2019s perspective.\n\neta \u2014 my judgement remains the same no matter the nuances of this situation. You will always be the asshole if you show up unannounced & uninvited to anyone\u2019s home if they tell you they are not feeling well.", "I wish I could have bother of them type on here to get every point of view but sadly you can only see mine.", "You should definitely take note of this situation. There\u2019s really nothing more you can do but apologize. You have done that. If gf wants to have a conversation about this that makes sense but it really doesn\u2019t rise to the level of this type of reaction from them. \n\nYou\u2019re not crazy but it\u2019s also not worth your time or energy to investigate this further. You know what happened. If they want to argue & rewrite history \u2026 you may want to consider other options.", "Thank you for your comments."]}
