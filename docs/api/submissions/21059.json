Thank you so supporting your daughter\u2019s mental health. When I was young I weighed 120 lbs at 5\u20193. I was not overweight by any stretch of the imagination but some people made comments to me that set me on a journey of weight gain and loss. Now that I\u2019m am older I realize that so called people with good intentions can be the most harmful people in the world.\n\nTrust me when I say that your daughter is well aware that she is overweight. She just hasn\u2019t figured out how to go about handling it. When she is ready she will start her journey she will. She is probably tired of dieting and failing and looking for a better way. However, I would take her out for coffee and tell her that you are concerned that your wife\u2019s comments may have been inappropriate and upsetting to her. Let her know that you want to make sure she is okay and that you are there for her. Ask her if she is struggling with anything in her life and that if she is you will always be there for her. \n\nShe will appreciate your sentiments more than you know and at some point and time in the future she may reach out to you and discuss her weight and self esteem issues with you.

I would go to her away from your daughter and tell her that as much as you love her you are concerned that what she said to your daughter and the way she said it was harmful and inappropriate. Let her know that what she did had the opposite effect of what she was trying to accomplish. Tell her that ignoring you and not speaking to you doesn\u2019t help anyone nor does it improve the situation. Let her know that you love her but you will not allow her tear down your daughter\u2019s self esteem. Furthermore, tell her that when she is ready to talk about this situation you will be there. \n\nOP, I for one am thankful that you didn\u2019t participate in bashing your daughter.

She doesn\u2019t need her mother or anyone else telling her she\u2019s fat.", "NTA, but your wife is. Your wife is completely out of line. Shaming someone does not stop them or prevent them from engaging in the unhealthy behavior. In fact, studies show that the more someone feels shame for an unwanted behavior (I.e. over eating, drug addiction, alcoholism, numbing, etc) the more they engage in the unwanted behavior. \n\nMy parents shamed me for my weight, and it has caused a lifetime of body image issues. I wish more than anything that when they saw I was battling my weight, they would have just loved and supported me. Instead, they said things like \u201cwhy do you think guys don\u2019t call you anymore? If you lost 15lb you wouldn\u2019t have to do that weird shit with your hair\u201d. It was humiliating and I\u2019ve battled body image issues my entire life because of it.\n\nYou need to tell your wife to stop it now, no exceptions. Tell her there is a plethora of information out there to explain that shaming is not helpful and if she wants to help your daughter, the best thing she can do is tell her she is loved and beautiful no matter what. Tell her to apologize profusely and beg for your daughters forgiveness and then ask her how she can best support your daughter. \n\nYour wife is projecting her insecurities onto your daughter. She is looking at her as an extension of herself, and that is not fair and it\u2019s not healthy. No wonder your daughter is battling a weight problem. I guarantee this is not the first time your wife has made snide, underhanded remarks about weight. I bet your daughter has been listening to this her entire life.
