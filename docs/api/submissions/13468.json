The place is not the nicest, but it's better food than McDonald's and we use to go there when we want to have a \"semi special occasion\". This time the occasion was that the four of our had passed our exams. \n\nIt was lunch time, the place was not completely full, but full enough. We had bad weather so we stayed inside (everyone did). Most people were adults. \n\nThen two women (an older one and a middle aged one) came with a baby and a kid around 7/10 years old. I was sitting facing the door so I saw them walk in but I didn't think any of it, I'm not someone easily annoyed by kids most times. They took a table in a corner. Our table was around the middle of the room.\n\nWe were waiting for our food and chatting. The kid was playing with the baby and they were making a bit of noise, but then again we all were making noise as most of us were accompanied and chatting. \n\nAfter our food came in though, the kid started to wander around. He wanted to read a sign near the door, then one near the back. After that he wanted to go to bathroom, then he wanted to go outside, etc. It was kinda annoying, but quite easy to just ignore. Should I say that neither of the women that were with him did nothing to stop him, not at any time. \n\nAt some point, the kid started to run around while yelling, he was playing to something by himself. He went on and on, and neither of the women did something. Other people were looking annoyed too. He even accidentally hit my friend's chair. As we were in the middle table, he started running circles around us. By the third time he tried passing next to me I put my arm out to stop him. I told him to stop that and to go sit down and wait until he's home to run around because it's inappropriate to bother other people at a public space. I also told him I'll have him wait outside alone if he doesn't behaves (which I was obviously not gonna do because I can't basically, it was just to scare him off). I honestly don't know how it came out, in my mind I was quite calm but apparently I was screaming at the kid. \n\nThe kid started to cry and then (I assume) his mom came in and told me off for telling at him and how he's just a kid and was playing and such. I told her I wouldn't have had to do anything if she would have told the kid to stay quiet before. \n\nSome guy from the staff came in and asked what happened. She told him I had yelled at the kid, I told him that yeah I did but calmly explained why I did it. He said that we should just let this go for once and that next time the staff will manage the situation before anything happens. The woman was fuming so they left. \n\nMy friends told me I did in fact screamed at the kid but they were annoyed too and said they were about to complain with management over this kid. I honestly think that would've been the best idea and now I think that I took the wrong turn here.", "created_utc": 1680089551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125l6c9/aita_for_screaming_at_a_child_and_making_him_cry/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if the parent wasn't doing anything to stop the kid, take it up with the parent, don't hassle the kid. The kid doesn't know any better. Threatening something you knew you couldn't do, purely to scare the kid is putting your comfort above the child's emotional wellbeing. You have a right to say to the parents or to management if the kid is out of control, but you don't have the right to terrorise the kid so you're comfortable. \n\nThe fact you seem not to be able to see even what your own friends who were also annoyed could see; that you were yelling at a little kid, suggests you're trying to deny it to yourself.

If it bothered you so much and you really wanted him to stop and not escalate the situation, why didn\u2019t you talk to the mom or the staff? While I told the kid to stop kicking me bc it was hurting me, I then talked to the mom and told her I was ill and coming home from the doctors.

Guess what, being in public means being around other people. Also kids. If you Cant handle that, stay at campus. \n\nWhile i agree that it is ok to say that your boundries are being tested, say so to their parents. It is not your job to raise other kids.

Its how you handled the situation that made YTA.\n\nIn general, you shouldn't attempt to discipline someone else's kid, even when their parents are failing to do it themselves. Yelling at a child is not constructive or helpful. You should've said something to the parents imo. \n\nso yeah, YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThe whole situation was annoying, but it's never the child's fault. If the kid's behavior was getting too disruptive, you should have approach the parents or someone from the staff. Yelling at the kid was absolutely uncalled for and fixed nothing.", "I can tell you are not used to being around kids, which is understandable but YTA for sure.

You definitely don't yell at them, and you definitely don't threaten them", "If the lady says you screamed, and your friends said you screamed, and it was loud enough to draw waitstaff you at least yelled.  That's not okay in public or at small children--especially strangers.\n\nYTA.\n\nThe parents of the child are AHs.  The kid is a kid.\n\nSticking your arm out is okay.

Raised voice, threats, I feel bad when parents treat their own children like that. For a stranger it\u2019s inexcusable. Your reactions to a minor inconvenience are grossly disproportionate. \n\nI say with with concern and compassion, but I think you have some unprocessed trauma from your childhood. Were you yelled at and threatened as a kid? Are you in an ok place now?  Maybe consider telling this story to a therapist.", "YTA \n\nIn what world is it okay to try and discipline a strangers child.

Do better.", "A lot of entitled parents are about to scream that YTA but the intention was not wrong.

I see a lot of YTAs but for me, that\u2019s condoning the parent not parenting and letting her kid be disruptive and obnoxious.

Putting your hand out to stop the running was okay. It sounds like you raised your voice too much but also that was unintentional.\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase here. You finally acted because both the adults with the kid and the restaurant staff failed you. The adults had a duty to keep the kid from bothering other restaurant patrons and didn\u2019t. I never let my child behave like that in a non fast food restaurant and I am a light touch indulgent parent. He probably could have run around your table 50 times and they would have done nothing. The restaurant staff had a duty to ensure no one patron, regardless of age, unduly disrupted the enjoyment of other patrons eating their meal.
