The place is not the nicest, but it's better food than McDonald's and we use to go there when we want to have a \"semi special occasion\". This time the occasion was that the four of our had passed our exams. \n\nIt was lunch time, the place was not completely full, but full enough. We had bad weather so we stayed inside (everyone did). Most people were adults. \n\nThen two women (an older one and a middle aged one) came with a baby and a kid around 7/10 years old. I was sitting facing the door so I saw them walk in but I didn't think any of it, I'm not someone easily annoyed by kids most times. They took a table in a corner. Our table was around the middle of the room.\n\nWe were waiting for our food and chatting. The kid was playing with the baby and they were making a bit of noise, but then again we all were making noise as most of us were accompanied and chatting. \n\nAfter our food came in though, the kid started to wander around. He wanted to read a sign near the door, then one near the back. After that he wanted to go to bathroom, then he wanted to go outside, etc. It was kinda annoying, but quite easy to just ignore. Should I say that neither of the women that were with him did nothing to stop him, not at any time. \n\nAt some point, the kid started to run around while yelling, he was playing to something by himself. He went on and on, and neither of the women did something. Other people were looking annoyed too. He even accidentally hit my friend's chair. As we were in the middle table, he started running circles around us. By the third time he tried passing next to me I put my arm out to stop him. I told him to stop that and to go sit down and wait until he's home to run around because it's inappropriate to bother other people at a public space. I also told him I'll have him wait outside alone if he doesn't behaves (which I was obviously not gonna do because I can't basically, it was just to scare him off). I honestly don't know how it came out, in my mind I was quite calm but apparently I was screaming at the kid. \n\nThe kid started to cry and then (I assume) his mom came in and told me off for telling at him and how he's just a kid and was playing and such. I told her I wouldn't have had to do anything if she would have told the kid to stay quiet before. \n\nSome guy from the staff came in and asked what happened. She told him I had yelled at the kid, I told him that yeah I did but calmly explained why I did it. He said that we should just let this go for once and that next time the staff will manage the situation before anything happens. The woman was fuming so they left. \n\nMy friends told me I did in fact screamed at the kid but they were annoyed too and said they were about to complain with management over this kid. I honestly think that would've been the best idea and now I think that I took the wrong turn here.", "created_utc": 1680089551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125l6c9/aita_for_screaming_at_a_child_and_making_him_cry/", "score": 558, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Putting your hand out to stop the running was okay. It sounds like you raised your voice too much but also that was unintentional.\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase here. You finally acted because both the adults with the kid and the restaurant staff failed you. The adults had a duty to keep the kid from bothering other restaurant patrons and didn\u2019t. I never let my child behave like that in a non fast food restaurant and I am a light touch indulgent parent. He probably could have run around your table 50 times and they would have done nothing.

You should have walked up to the women's table first and said quite clearly and loudly but calmly \"Please keep that kid under control, we've had a few near misses already and I don't want to see anyone hurt by him or have their property damaged.\" so that anyone who missed it could see it was them responsible for his rude and dangerous behaviour.

Especially in a restaurant (I don't care if it was McDonald's) and to the point of bothering other people.  Seems like many (not all) parents just don't keep their kids in line like they should when out in public.  Maybe that's why we have out of control young people that feel like they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, and wherever they want.\n\nAgain, yelling not cool......but NTA otherwise", "YTA, but in this case I think it was justifiable.

I remember someone who complained because his meat was too raw which I thought was weird too since most people would think that meat was just right. I remember a woman with a dress too which again was weird because we had cold weather, everyone but that woman was wearing a jacket at least. Idk as I said I guess that I'm always aware of my surroundings and I have good memory too", "Exactly.\n\nAnd everyone already knows that kids are assholes so there is no reason to point it out.  And usually if a kid is being an asshole it's ignorance not maliciousness.", "Emotional things can have a lasting impact on us and I say that as someone who grew up in a verbally abusive household. You screamed at a young kid. You don't remember it.\n\nYou've asked the Internet. The Internet has given its judgement. You don't like the judgement you're being given so you're still trying to justify it \n\nYTA. It is never okay to scream at a little kid especially when it's not yours.", "That kid will never forget that incident. You need to do better. I literally still remember some rando older white man yelling at me when I was around 5 at a grocery store. I\u2019m 40 now. You 100% burned a memory into that kids brain. Seems like you have some underlying issues that need to be addressed as well. You should be able to tell when you are screaming or not.", "Why you trying so hard to justify your shitty abusive actions though?", "Emotional trauma is a thing though soooo.", " 4 years ago, I was outside with a few friends and my, then 2 year old, son. There was a woman walking her dog coming towards us. The moment she approached us, the dog directly jumped into my son's direction and barked. It took a few seconds for the woman to pull that dog away. She didn't say anything to it, and I was too surprised to address the dogs behavior to her. My son cried, and it took some time to calm him. \n\nThe dog did not touch my son. The dog was suddenly close and barking at him (luckily, it had the leach on, so I did not have to find out what would've happened otherwise).\n\nUntil now, my son is afraid of dogs, especially when they're barking.", "But you need other people to tell you you\u2019re screaming?", "So your super aware with your bat senses to come up with all that, but your mega hyper superpowers couldn't tell you were shouting at a child?", "Please be aware of how much you suck and of how many people call you the AH in this case. Because you are."]}
