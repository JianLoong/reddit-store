The place is not the nicest, but it's better food than McDonald's and we use to go there when we want to have a \"semi special occasion\". This time the occasion was that the four of our had passed our exams. \n\nIt was lunch time, the place was not completely full, but full enough. We had bad weather so we stayed inside (everyone did). Most people were adults. \n\nThen two women (an older one and a middle aged one) came with a baby and a kid around 7/10 years old. I was sitting facing the door so I saw them walk in but I didn't think any of it, I'm not someone easily annoyed by kids most times. They took a table in a corner. Our table was around the middle of the room.\n\nWe were waiting for our food and chatting. The kid was playing with the baby and they were making a bit of noise, but then again we all were making noise as most of us were accompanied and chatting. \n\nAfter our food came in though, the kid started to wander around. He wanted to read a sign near the door, then one near the back. After that he wanted to go to bathroom, then he wanted to go outside, etc. It was kinda annoying, but quite easy to just ignore. Should I say that neither of the women that were with him did nothing to stop him, not at any time. \n\nAt some point, the kid started to run around while yelling, he was playing to something by himself. He went on and on, and neither of the women did something. Other people were looking annoyed too. He even accidentally hit my friend's chair. As we were in the middle table, he started running circles around us. By the third time he tried passing next to me I put my arm out to stop him. I told him to stop that and to go sit down and wait until he's home to run around because it's inappropriate to bother other people at a public space. I also told him I'll have him wait outside alone if he doesn't behaves (which I was obviously not gonna do because I can't basically, it was just to scare him off). I honestly don't know how it came out, in my mind I was quite calm but apparently I was screaming at the kid. \n\nThe kid started to cry and then (I assume) his mom came in and told me off for telling at him and how he's just a kid and was playing and such. I told her I wouldn't have had to do anything if she would have told the kid to stay quiet before. \n\nSome guy from the staff came in and asked what happened. She told him I had yelled at the kid, I told him that yeah I did but calmly explained why I did it. He said that we should just let this go for once and that next time the staff will manage the situation before anything happens. The woman was fuming so they left. \n\nMy friends told me I did in fact screamed at the kid but they were annoyed too and said they were about to complain with management over this kid. I honestly think that would've been the best idea and now I think that I took the wrong turn here.", "created_utc": 1680089551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125l6c9/aita_for_screaming_at_a_child_and_making_him_cry/", "score": 2170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Putting your hand out to stop the running was okay. It sounds like you raised your voice too much but also that was unintentional.\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase here. You finally acted because both the adults with the kid and the restaurant staff failed you. The adults had a duty to keep the kid from bothering other restaurant patrons and didn\u2019t. I never let my child behave like that in a non fast food restaurant and I am a light touch indulgent parent. He probably could have run around your table 50 times and they would have done nothing.

No one cares how fancy or how much of a dive the restaurant was - you screamed at a kid and threatened them to the point that they started crying and had multiple other adults, besides your friends, taken aback and caused enough of a scene you got the wait staffs attention. The kid may have been annoying but you must have looked like an absolute psycho and I have no doubt that the staff is going to keep an eye on you and your friends to make sure you don't cause a scene again if they let you guys in the door at all. Heck - for your own safety you need to get this under control because if you lose your shit to the wrong person or wrong kid there are people out there who will not hesitate to teach you a lesson for screaming at their kid to the point of crying.
