The place is not the nicest, but it's better food than McDonald's and we use to go there when we want to have a \"semi special occasion\". This time the occasion was that the four of our had passed our exams. \n\nIt was lunch time, the place was not completely full, but full enough. We had bad weather so we stayed inside (everyone did). Most people were adults. \n\nThen two women (an older one and a middle aged one) came with a baby and a kid around 7/10 years old. I was sitting facing the door so I saw them walk in but I didn't think any of it, I'm not someone easily annoyed by kids most times. They took a table in a corner. Our table was around the middle of the room.\n\nWe were waiting for our food and chatting. The kid was playing with the baby and they were making a bit of noise, but then again we all were making noise as most of us were accompanied and chatting. \n\nAfter our food came in though, the kid started to wander around. He wanted to read a sign near the door, then one near the back. After that he wanted to go to bathroom, then he wanted to go outside, etc. It was kinda annoying, but quite easy to just ignore. Should I say that neither of the women that were with him did nothing to stop him, not at any time. \n\nAt some point, the kid started to run around while yelling, he was playing to something by himself. He went on and on, and neither of the women did something. Other people were looking annoyed too. He even accidentally hit my friend's chair. As we were in the middle table, he started running circles around us. By the third time he tried passing next to me I put my arm out to stop him. I told him to stop that and to go sit down and wait until he's home to run around because it's inappropriate to bother other people at a public space. I also told him I'll have him wait outside alone if he doesn't behaves (which I was obviously not gonna do because I can't basically, it was just to scare him off). I honestly don't know how it came out, in my mind I was quite calm but apparently I was screaming at the kid. \n\nThe kid started to cry and then (I assume) his mom came in and told me off for telling at him and how he's just a kid and was playing and such. I told her I wouldn't have had to do anything if she would have told the kid to stay quiet before. \n\nSome guy from the staff came in and asked what happened. She told him I had yelled at the kid, I told him that yeah I did but calmly explained why I did it. He said that we should just let this go for once and that next time the staff will manage the situation before anything happens. The woman was fuming so they left. \n\nMy friends told me I did in fact screamed at the kid but they were annoyed too and said they were about to complain with management over this kid. I honestly think that would've been the best idea and now I think that I took the wrong turn here.", "created_utc": 1680089551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125l6c9/aita_for_screaming_at_a_child_and_making_him_cry/", "score": 5287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Putting your hand out to stop the running was okay. It sounds like you raised your voice too much but also that was unintentional.\n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase here. You finally acted because both the adults with the kid and the restaurant staff failed you. The adults had a duty to keep the kid from bothering other restaurant patrons and didn\u2019t. I never let my child behave like that in a non fast food restaurant and I am a light touch indulgent parent. He probably could have run around your table 50 times and they would have done nothing.

No one cares how fancy or how much of a dive the restaurant was - you screamed at a kid and threatened them to the point that they started crying and had multiple other adults, besides your friends, taken aback and caused enough of a scene you got the wait staffs attention. The kid may have been annoying but you must have looked like an absolute psycho and I have no doubt that the staff is going to keep an eye on you and your friends to make sure you don't cause a scene again if they let you guys in the door at all. Heck - for your own safety you need to get this under control because if you lose your shit to the wrong person or wrong kid there are people out there who will not hesitate to teach you a lesson for screaming at their kid to the point of crying. People kill people or put people in the hospital for less - you're lucky that person was not there when you were banshee screaming at that kid.", "This isn't even a formal place.

I don't agree with OP yelling at the kid but the mom? Yeah, she's the A H because the kid is HER responsibility and she just let him run around the restaurant and be disruptive. If she didn't want her kid yelled at by another person, she should have been parenting him and his behavior. ESH.", "Parents who neglect their children are TAs. \n\nESH, mom should have paid attention. OP shouldn\u2019t have screamed or threatened a child. The staff shouldn\u2019t have let a child run around a restaurant like it\u2019s a park.", "What you described IS an ESH situation, though. His AH reaction to her AH behavior doesn\u2019t make her NOT an AH.", "The mom should have told the kid to stop or left the restaurant. Its not a playground.", "It's ridiculous that people get so annoyed at asshole OPs that they seem to forget the meaning of asshole. Someone letting their kid run circles around a table is an asshole, full stop, obviously. Someone being a bigger asshole in the room doesn't change that", "I'm actually afraid for people in OP's life if everyone is telling him he was screaming and he doesn't recognize it, especially because he thought he was saying it calmly.", "All the manager has to do is go up to the woman and say \u201chey, for the safety of our patrons and staff, running in the restaurant isn\u2019t allowed.\u201d  He doesn\u2019t need to say anything to the kid, but he should say something or risk losing the rest of his customers.  A lot of managers still probably won\u2019t and the thought makes me want to cry.  Rowdy children running around disrupting meals drives me crazy, I can\u2019t understand the entitlement of thinking that the rest of the customers\u2019 dining experience doesn\u2019t matter and they should be subjected to that sort of behavior.\n\nI\u2019m anxious af because I\u2019m pregnant and if I ever turn into one of those people, I hope someone can talk sense into me.  I love restaurants but if my kid can\u2019t behave I hope that I would either get take out or take them outside to calm them down and try again.", "But again, we don\u2019t know if the parent was aware the kid was being disruptive because OP took it upon himself to discipline a stranger\u2019s child. \n\nIt\u2019s possible the parent was ignoring her kid\u2019s behavior, but it\u2019s just as possible that she had already spoken to him and said something like \u201cif you keep running around we have to leave.\u201d", "Yes. The parent should do something if a child is acting like that in a small public space. No one should scream at a strange child unless there's immediate danger.\n\nTwo stories: When my son was two, some old couple (only other people there) complained to the wait staff at Del Taco about my son climbing on the booth benches next to our booth. The old couple was on the other side of the restaurant and was worried about him hurting himself. My wife was pissed but I was like, \"Thank you. We'll keep in our booth now, although I know my son is not in danger as he regularly climbs spaces like these safely at parks and other places.\" That old couple had the appropriate response to a child they wanted to correct. I might have been the AH for disagreeing with their perception, but oh well, I still respected the staff and brought him to our booth where he continued to climb up and down the benches and under the table without injury.\n\nOne time at Chili's (son was 4 now), I had to grab my son and carry him out of the restaurant until he agreed to calm down and behave. He was jumping up and down on his seat to talk to our neighbors and refused to quiet down when it was obviously disturbing them. I didn't wait for the staff to get involved or the other party to say something because, you know, at least sometimes I am a responsible dad.\n\nOP is the biggest AH. The mom was also an AH.", "Bingo. Everyone's an asshole in this equation. Same old song and dance.", "We have to trust OPs narrative on the kids behaviour though.\n\nRead the whole post, they are hyper fixated on them and they try and brush it off as it not annoying them.\n\nThen they say they were talking to a kid when everyone says they were shouting. They also threatened to put the kid outside in 'weather' whatever it was.", "ESH does imply everyone is unless stated otherwise\u2026 which people did. No one claimed the kid was an AH.", "See, the age part is iffy here. If we are talking a 7 year old then yeah, OP is TA\u2026 if kid was 10 though? They know better. They choose to act like that. Therefore OP is not TA\u2026\n\nSpeaking of management, where were they during this? Like this kid is running crazy for many minutes and no one but OP thought to stop him or tell his mum? Sounds like management is TA", "Why does a kid need a \"respectful request\" to behave in public?!!! How about the kid's parent/guardian watch the little urchin, and be certain he's acting appropriately. Ironically, that adult would probably be the first to bitch, had someone else's kid been running about. I say this as a dad who raised 3 very respectful children.", "I kinda think the kid does suck. It's not his fault, because his mom sucks, but right now he sucks too.", "7-10 is 100% an age when they should know how to behave in a restaurant and not run around screaming. At the very least they have been in a school setting where they have seen normal behavior, even if the parents suck.", "a 7-10 yo can handle sitting in a McDonald's. Mom sucks for not reeling him in sooner. It's disrespectful to the staff and other customers. It's fine not to blame the kid but the lion's share is on the mom. OP is an AH just for yelling, but not for stopping the kid from being a nusciance when his parent wouldn't.", "Yep running around like that is a 3-5 year old behavior he should have known better", "I don't doubt it, but I couldn't fund the \"downvoted to hell\" comment in their history, and usually when something isn't as clear as it seems to be, it's because the person who is telling the story is leaving details out... I want to see how they explain the lack of context.", "> It's honestly not OPs fault that he didn't emotionally regulate\n\nuh? If 7 is old enough to self regulate, you can *definitely* expect a grown-ass adult to self regulate."]}
