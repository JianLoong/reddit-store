{"id": 27414, "submission_id": "16pbutt", "title": "AITA For Telling A Special Needs Girl To Just Fucking Go To The Restroom?", "selftext": "For context, we only have two bathrooms on the first floor, and at lunch one of them gets locked, and you cant go upstairs unless you ask a teacher or a security or have a pass. you either have to use the one open, wait to go upstairs, or look around and plead with them to go up.\n\nI usually just wait til lunch was over, but at that moment I had no choice. Since it was the only bathroom open, in flooded a stream of people as soon as I stepped into there. I waited patiently, slightly frustrated due to my need to use the restroom, the fact my friend was not responding to text, my boyfriends best friend was waiting to meet me, and just the general tiredness.\nA line was going out of the bathroom, and the ones in stalls where taking their sweet time.\nA girl walked In, standing beside me, and a few minutes later a stall opened. Since I was first in line, I obviously started walking to it, when suddenly the girl stepped infront of me.\n\n\n*Girl* : excuse me, it's an emergency\n\n*Me* : I was in line first..?\n\n*Girl*: but it's an emergency!\n\nOf course I was somewhat pissed, she cut line infront of nine different girls who have waited for the last ten minutes, but at the same time, if it was an emergency there's no way around it. Plus I had no energy to fight a girl over a damn toilet, it's kinda silly to do so.\n\nSo I step back, motion to the stall and tell her to go.\n She starts that way, but looks back and starts to open her mouth to tell me I should go first, (despite the fact it was an emergency  and she literally was halfway in the stall) so I cut her off mid sentence and tell her to just go. Not in a rude way, just as a statement, since the longer she stalled, the longer the rest of us have to wait. No anger, no nothing. Just told her to just go. Looking back, I should have just remained silent, but I didn't see the harm in my words. \n\nShe peaked her head out and told me I was rude, so I just told her to just fucking go. I was done being polite, since I was in no mood for argument.\nShe ended up coming out a second later, (the toilet was clogged) and said out loud that the toilet was clogged,  and she'd hold it.\n\n...\nExcuse me what?\nWhat happend to the emergency????? You need to go badly, remember??????\n\nAnyways, she steps out of the bathroom, another stall opens so I take it. Outside, she's complaining loudly, not screaming but still in a raised voice, about telling her to fucking go and how rude I was. Then she left the hallways.\n\nI do my business quickly, wash my hands, leave, grab my friends, meet my bf best friend,  and get lunch.\n\nWhile chatting about the girl, a friend of mine knew of her, and told me she was special needs.\nNow I'm conflicted, I've gotten over the issue entirely, but now knowing that she was special needs, I can't quite figure out if I was the jerk or not. I feel like I was, but at the same time I still think skipping line by claiming it was an emergency, just to walk out a second later saying that she could wait, was entitled and rude.\n\nSo am I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1695393094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pbutt/aita_for_telling_a_special_needs_girl_to_just/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
