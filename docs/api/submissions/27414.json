Since it was the only bathroom open, in flooded a stream of people as soon as I stepped into there. I waited patiently, slightly frustrated due to my need to use the restroom, the fact my friend was not responding to text, my boyfriends best friend was waiting to meet me, and just the general tiredness.\nA line was going out of the bathroom, and the ones in stalls where taking their sweet time.\nA girl walked In, standing beside me, and a few minutes later a stall opened. Since I was first in line, I obviously started walking to it, when suddenly the girl stepped infront of me.\n\n\n*Girl* : excuse me, it's an emergency\n\n*Me* : I was in line first..?\n\n*Girl*: but it's an emergency!\n\nOf course I was somewhat pissed, she cut line infront of nine different girls who have waited for the last ten minutes, but at the same time, if it was an emergency there's no way around it. Plus I had no energy to fight a girl over a damn toilet, it's kinda silly to do so.\n\nSo I step back, motion to the stall and tell her to go.\n She starts that way, but looks back and starts to open her mouth to tell me I should go first, (despite the fact it was an emergency  and she literally was halfway in the stall) so I cut her off mid sentence and tell her to just go. Not in a rude way, just as a statement, since the longer she stalled, the longer the rest of us have to wait. No anger, no nothing. Just told her to just go. Looking back, I should have just remained silent, but I didn't see the harm in my words. \n\nShe peaked her head out and told me I was rude, so I just told her to just fucking go. I was done being polite, since I was in no mood for argument.\nShe ended up coming out a second later, (the toilet was clogged) and said out loud that the toilet was clogged,  and she'd hold it.\n\n...\nExcuse me what?\nWhat happend to the emergency????? You need to go badly, remember??????\n\nAnyways, she steps out of the bathroom, another stall opens so I take it. Outside, she's complaining loudly, not screaming but still in a raised voice, about telling her to fucking go and how rude I was. Then she left the hallways.\n\nI do my business quickly, wash my hands, leave, grab my friends, meet my bf best friend,  and get lunch.\n\nWhile chatting about the girl, a friend of mine knew of her, and told me she was special needs.\nNow I'm conflicted, I've gotten over the issue entirely, but now knowing that she was special needs, I can't quite figure out if I was the jerk or not. I feel like I was, but at the same time I still think skipping line by claiming it was an emergency, just to walk out a second later saying that she could wait, was entitled and rude.\n\nSo am I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1695393094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pbutt/aita_for_telling_a_special_needs_girl_to_just/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's add *demeaning* to this, too.  This nonsense cuts into your eating time, as well.\n\nIf the school is afraid that the girls will be vandalizing the bathroom they have locked, they need to hire someone for a few hours a day to monitor it.  \n\nI know that schools are short of funds.  That doesn't give them leave to treat students like *dirt*, however. \n\nPerhaps one of the administrators would care enough to monitor the bathroom.

At 30 I couldn\u2019t care less but when I was struggling with it at 13-18 (still undiagnosed despite constants doctors visits) I was far too embarrassed to declare the special need to the school or anybody \n\nYou were understandably pissed off cause you needed to go \n\nThem being Autistic maybe contributed  to taking what you said very badly, also it can affect other things like sense of urgency to go", "No judgment, and I'm sure I'll be downvoted to hell, but please don't call us \"special needs\"", "I don't know the girl's specific need(there are people who literally have to go when they have to go)\n\nBut your attitude is quite unpretty as presented in this post.\n\nPlus if YOU have no problem using a clogged toilet, why didn't you let her use the newly available stall while YOU used the clogged toilet????\n\nIf you had a problem using a clogged toilet, why wasn't she allowed to have a problem with it?", "I think that's being a bit deliberately disingenuous - would you say a wheelchair user should be \"treated like anyone else\" and therefore doesn't require a larger stall? People with additional needs can sometimes require accommodations for those needs, and it's not somehow \"equality\" to refuse to acknowledge that. \n\nHaving said that, if anyone asked me to cut a bathroom line because of an emergency, I would let them, additional needs or not.

I figured if thats the only one open, it'll have to do. She got to it first, found out it was clogged, and just left the restroom entirely, and a few seconds later a girl flushed and opened a stall up.

If it's her symptoms, then she should have special pass. But the support needs aren't always fully and properly given.\n\nAnyways, this nurse's office talk is completely alien to me.
