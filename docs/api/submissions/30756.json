When I first met him I was a senior in college and I was living with my best friend who had the cutest dog\u2026.we will call the dog Joey. We were obsessed with Joey and she was clearly on my mind all the time because when I met my cousins boyfriend for the first time and found out his name was also Joey, I was quick to tell him the comparison. I shook his hand and said \u201cHi my name is \u2014\u2014, my roommates dog\u2019s name is also Joey! That\u2019s so cool!\u201d. I thought I said it very nicely and I was excited that I found a way to connect with him. However, my cousin did NOT feel the same way. I later found out that after that night she told everyone in the family that I came across \u201crude and entitled\u201d and it \u201creally hurt her feelings that I would compare her new boyfriend to a dog\u201d. I was in shock and actual disbelief at first. To make things worse, I was the last one to find out that I hurt her feelings and when the next time I saw her boyfriend and he reintroduced himself to me I said \u201cno yeah we met! Remember my roommates dog\u2019s name is Joey?\u201d I quickly saw everyone\u2019s reactions to my comment  and was super confused. I asked my mom why everyone acted weird when I said that and THEN she told me about how my cousin was upset. \n\nMy cousin and I have talked about the situation and I have tried to explain to her that I was trying to connect with him and I never once wanted to make him feel uncomfortable. She told me that I \u201ccame off so disrespectful and rude\u201d and that she was \u201cembarrassed of me and how I acted.\u201d I asked multiple people in my family if I was rude when I made the comment and they all said no. They said I was cheery and sounded really sincere. Family members also told me that Joey was not upset and it was my cousin who was the one offended. \nHer exact words were \u201cI was just disappointed that Joey had to meet you like that and think you were a shallow person right off the bat and you should apologize\u201d I told her that I didn\u2019t care what Joey thought of me at this point and I will not apologize to him because this whole thing is ridiculous.

But, you know, as an outsider.\n\nHe's not mad,  but she is because you look \"shallow\" for mentioning his name is the same as a dog?  Huh?  I guess you'd look shallow if you said he's not as good looking/well dressed/rich as [famous actor named Joe Something] and therefore you won't ever speak to him again.   THAT would be shallow.

So I said to the guy as he sat with his gal, \u201cSo, how far along are you guys?\u201d. The guy looked at me oddly and then said \u201cwhat?\u201d. So, I repeated myself and added \u201cwhen\u2019s the baby due?\u201d. Then the guy looked at me horrified and said \u201cDude!, she\u2019s not pregnant.\u201d\u2026\n  I felt so embarrassed (really for everyone, me, her, and especially him!).

If I were to stand in the boyfriend shoes, I don't know if I'd very much appreciate being associated with a dog that I've never met, but I don't think I'd feel like there were ill intentions.  But I also don't think I would feel like we were connecting on a friendly level either.  I'd probably just think you were strange.\n\nIn my opinion, the only person that you could have actually offended was your cousin's boyfriend, and he said he didn't mind so.  I don't think you have too much to worry about, your cousin just needs to Grow up a little bit", "[deleted]", "NAH. I truly believe you didn\u2019t mean it as an insult the first time. \nWhy did you have to go and say it a second time?

Or did you find out she didn\u2019t like it the first time after you\u2019d met him a second time?\n\nIt\u2019s just a little strange you think someone\u2019s name and a dog\u2019s name being similar is a conversation starter.

You\u2019re not an AH but, sorry, you come across as juvenile or mentally handicapped or something. I would expect a 5 year old to say something like that. What exactly is \u201cfaking it till you make it\u201d with your family? I\u2019m really sorry to be mean but you do sound very off. Try to act more normal if you can help it, especially at things family gatherings. \n\nHowever, nothing your cousin said after that was warranted. She is a nasty person to respond like that. Do not apologize to her under any circumstances.
