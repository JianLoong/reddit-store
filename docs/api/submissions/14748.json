It\u2019s a very severe trauma that I was unable to get therapy for for years (my mother doesn\u2019t believe in it). Because of that, I\u2019ve yet to get my license, which is a common source of contention between my mother and I. \n\nWhen Taylor Swift announced her Eras tour, I tried to get tickets. but if you know anything about that, Ticketmaster was a nightmare. So I was unable to get them in time and lost out. \n\nTickets now range from like $800 to $1500 apiece from what I\u2019ve seen, which just isn\u2019t feasible for me. My mother knew that, so she made a deal with me: if I got my driver\u2019s license before our city\u2019s show, she would buy me two tickets.\n\nI made sure to make it clear just how much that costed before I agreed to the deal, and she said it wasn\u2019t a problem. So we shook on it and I got to work. \n\nWell anyway, I got my license yesterday. My should-be show date is about a month away. And when I asked my mother to purchase the tickets for me, she told me she wasn\u2019t going to. \n\nAt first I was confused, so I asked her if it was a money issue. Bc if it was, honestly I would\u2019ve understood. But she assured me it was not, and told me she just wasn\u2019t really a fan of Taylor\u2019s music (she\u2019s Christian, and Taylor uses language she doesn\u2019t like). She said she didn\u2019t want me to go to Eras because she thought Taylor was a bad influence and the music was sinful. \n\nI got upset with her and told her that it\u2019s incredibly irritating to go back on an agreement. That I did what she asked and it was unfair to lie and switch up when I\u2019d had my hopes up for weeks. Then I gave her an ultimatum that either she could either buy me the tickets, or I\u2019d go stay with my grandma she made it right. \n\nI\u2019m writing this from my grandma\u2019s couch, so I\u2019m sure you know that didn\u2019t go over well. \n\nIk Taylor tickets are not a need. And I know they\u2019re expensive. So I worry that I may be the asshole because of that. \n\nBut I also think that you\u2019re only as good as your word. And it\u2019s really sucky to get someone\u2019s hopes up just go disappoint them like that when you knew you weren\u2019t gonna do it in the first place. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1681450089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12llcot/aita_for_demanding_taylor_swift_tickets/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plain, Simple.\n\nIt is true that she agreed to the deal, she shouldn't have tried to move away from the agreement, and her reasoning was her belief. But you went about this very... not like an adult. The ultimatum won't mean anything as everyone in this comment knows you'll come back.

Like you missed out on something you wanted and used the license as leverage to get your mom to pay for something super expensive, when you could\u2019ve just had big personal growth and gotten your license without that incentive. \n\nBut you\u2019re also 16 with a mom that is a hypocritical Christian type (I grew up in that kind of hell so I get it) and that kind of emotional maturity you are not going to learn from your mother. I didn\u2019t until I got out of my parents sphere and got counseling as an adult. But generally a big purchase on something fun you want and don\u2019t need - you should save up for and pay yourself. It might take a bit, but then you\u2019re counting on *yourself* to come through *and* your mom can\u2019t control it away from you with her religious beliefs. \n\nHowever your mom made a deal with you and went back on her word, so when it boils down to it my judgement would have to be NTA. You held up your end, she didn\u2019t. Now you know you can\u2019t trust her word on important things and you\u2019ll remember that going forward. Growing up in a house like yours I have a feeling you would\u2019ve ended up on grandmas couch eventually- 3 out of 7 of my siblings ended up kicked out or running away. \n\nI hope your grandmas cool and an option till your 18, that would be better. My grandma sure was! Amazing how freeing it is when you\u2019re not under the thumb of a controlling, fanatical, evangelist christian type. That sh*t is traumatizing.", "ESH too be honest what your mom did is wrong but did you seriously expect her to buy you two expensive tickets. People shake on deals all the time it doesn\u2019t mean anything", "Ok, I was totally ready to call you a spoiled brat, but after reading, NTA. But this does teach you a valuable lesson regarding your mother. In hindsight, you should've demanded she buy the tickets first, and THEN you should've gotten your license so you had a guaranteed ticket. And if she objected, you could've proposed she sells them for (probably huge) profit if you didn't keep up your end of the deal. Win-win.
