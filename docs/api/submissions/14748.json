It's as simple as that. And the way you handled it (if it was a money issue, I really you have understood) fair play to you! I'd still have been mad. Maybe less so, but don't agree to a thing you can't afford...\n\nGoddamn... you worked hard to get this, ans she just said \"nup\". I'm raging for you! That's some example of Christianity there...", "NTA but your mom sure is using a bait and switch tactic on a child. What a manipulative person she is.", "First off, NTA. Your mom lied and manipulated you, which (unless it\u2019s to literally save your life) is an AH move. \n\nSecond, I\u2019m sorry she wouldn\u2019t take you to therapy. Just because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in it\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t work - there is a *ton* of scientific research showing that it *does* work, and it never ceases to amaze me that some people are so arrogant that they believe they \u201cknow better\u201d than literally thousands of scientists. Smh \n\nThird, I\u2019m a psychologist who works primarily with trauma, so I understand how difficult it must\u2019ve been for you to get your license. Trauma literally re-wires the brain to be prepared for danger, so your brain would\u2019ve been screaming \u201cNO, THIS IS DANGEROUS\u201d the whole time and you freakin *did it anyway*. Like holy shit, kid\u2026 you\u2019ve got to be an unstoppable force of strength and determination to do that. Im honestly so impressed right now. That being said, whenever you\u2019re doubting your ability to do something in the future, please remember this moment. I truly believe you can do anything you set your mind to", "NTA, I'm so sorry your mom lied and broke your trust. But congrats on your success with confronting your fears and passing your driving license. I hope you'll be able to continue driving, it's really difficult to go anywhere in this world without driving sometimes. Especially in the States I think.\n\nYour mom shouldn't have tricked and lied to you. I was a late driver, lived in a capital where everything was reachable with subways, trains or bus, so I wasn't really inclined to pass my driving license (Especially since it's so expensive where I live). So my mom offered to pay for my lessons. I was glad for it, went to a few and then stopped... till my mom told me that if I wouldn't pass, I should repay her. The next day I went back and resumed my driving lessons. I knew what my mom did was fair and I'm glad to be able to drive now that I leave in the country.", "Cringe", "NTA - Does Taylor Swift have a song about liars?  Your mother can't bleat on about Christian Values if she is going to base her values as a reason to lie.     \n\nYour mother probably thought any promise was worth it if you got your drivers licence.", "NAH. I know she made a promise that she never should have made and you have every right to be upset but I honestly I REALLY can\u2019t blame her. I love Taylor Swift too. Been a swifty since she release Fearless when I was  in middle school, but I\u2019ll be DAMED if I\u2019m paying THOSE prices. They are like $3,000 for two at my venue I would tell my kid \u201ctuff luck\u201d too even if I DID have the money.", ">ice words about lying. Ironic to think that lying is somehow more acceptable than a few bad lyrics in a song. Liars are bad influences. I think the staying with grandma thing might be a little bit much here, just seems dramatic. That being said\u2026 NTA.  \n>  \n>203ReplyGive AwardShareReportSaveFollow\n\nChristians are sometimes the WORST Christians", "Obviously, it was intentionally unless she googled Talyor Swift at last minute. I'm sure though that she had that opinion before promising OP to buy tickets.", "Mom lied to get what she wanted and manipulated her own daughter.  She could have offered something else as an incentive but dangled the tickets since she knew how much her daughter wanted them. There is nothing to understand from the mother's side other than she's a liar.", "The mother offered it was not like op asked will you get me those tickets if I get my driver's license", "That's their whole thing, isn't it. Using scripture to validate their actions, and bending it to their needs.", "She says fuck in a few songs and then there's reputation which has snake imagery and zombies so maybe it's that. Maybe it's because of the song you need to calm down? Idk man I'm a swiftie but not a Christian.", "I can think of one where she says \u201ctoo bad she\u2019s f***ed in the head.\u201d I think it\u2019s called Champagne problems.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know many of her songs. I can\u2019t think of others that have \u201cbad words.\u201d\n\nOP- your Mom manipulated and lied to you.", "How does fuck around and find out apply here? The phrase is so overused!", "I get that, hence the YTA for the mother. But $1000 is an insane price to pay for a concert, regardless of the \u2018deal\u2019. Kinda have to step back and see the bigger picture here.", "You just described christianity", "We know that all too well.", "> Maybe it's because of the song you need to calm down?\n\nThat's a bingo", "Her newest album, Midnights, does drop a few f bombs as well. I was SHOCKED when I heard that. Not because Im against the word, but because I\u2019m not used to her swearing in songs", "Agree! \n\n\"Not your monkeys, not your circus\" should also be banned for overuse, and for just being a stupid saying to begin with.", "How is the price part of the bigger picture when the mom literally said price wasn't part of the problem? People aren't assholes for wanting something they were promised just because it's expensive, especially when the other person paying doesn't care about the price", "Then mom didn't have to make the offer. Regardless of the ticket price, which mom was aware of ahead of time,  she lied to get what she wanted. That makes her a truly awful person in my book.", "That's what I thought I did.", "Out of all the misspronounced words she has, that is the one you have a proobelum with?", "At what point did I say she was not a truly awful person?"]}
