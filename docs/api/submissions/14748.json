A lot of her songs are inspired by religion and as someone who grew up with religion forced down my throat discovering her music at age 14 in 1994 pretty much saved me (I am also a lesbian).

It would interesting to hear how your mother justifies lying as not being sinful or not being a bad example for you.", "Funny how Christianity becomes the authority when getting out of a commitment, but they magically forget about it when it comes to lying and causing harm to your own children. And yeah, children are supposed to *honor* their parents, but the same damn book says do not provoke your children to wrath. And if I faced one of my anxiety triggers based on the promise of a reward, I'd be pissed for getting fuck all back.\n\nAlso, I am a Christian and I curse like a fucking sailor and write smutty book about witches and Fae and monsterfucking. I do not believe that God has any issues with any of it. God and I got that shit sorted out when I was much younger. God knows your heart, your mom's heart, and Taylor Swift's heart, and the latter is probably better than most squeaky clean CCM acts, because at least she's not fucking lying about being in it for a career and oodles of money. Jesus was not some uptight moralist out to stop people from having fun or saying \"shit\" when they bang their hips on a table. Jesus's first miracle was giving wine to drunk people. And don't give me \"It's not that kind of wine\", the main complaint of the recipients of said miracle was that this was the best wine they'd ever had and they were too fucking drunk to enjoy it. *He gave wine to drunk people.* \n\nGod in no way values deceptions. He says it over and over: Don't lie. Whatever you do, *just fucking do it*, don't be wishy washy (Bible uses the term \"lukewarm\" because that particular writer really liked the aqueduct metaphor), and above all do not use *me* as an excuse for doing bad things to your fellow humans. Jesus valued *people,* and he valued their joy. He ate dinner with prostitutes. He laid hands on lepers when you weren't supposed to do that because it was a hugely contagious disease and soap was that weird stuff that shows up under damp cook fires. He honored not only his word but *other people's faith.* He once declared that a commander of the occupying force doing a great deal of harm to his people (Aka a Roman military leader) had more faith than his people, and honored that faith despite having every reason not to. He called people out for using their faith and piety as a mask for their politics over and over and over again. There is a significant chance one of his parables was a direct pot shot at the high priest of Jerusalem (Lazarus and the Rich Man) with a message of \"Go to Roman Hell, and take your family with you.\" When one of the men arresting him had an ear chopped off, he put the ear back on and told the rest of his followers to knock it off. So the OG Christian model was one of compassion, honesty, humility, and passionate love for other humans *and* the things those humans love passionately. Meaning *Jesus loves the things we love because we love them.* Including things like Stephen King books, porny fantasies, Taylor Swift and (IMHO) your gay spouse or trans reflection. If you believe that God made the world, then that means that God wanted *you*, the way you are, loving the things you love and doing the things you do, and he wants you to love those things because they're as much a part of you as your limbs and organs. And God does not want us to maim ourselves in his name when what we're chopping off is something he put there in the first place. \n\n Your mom has done two things very wrong here. First, she promised you something and then reneged, and two, she used God as her excuse. *That* is taking his name in vain. More so than saying \"God\" as a curse, that is *explicitly* what one of those ten commandment things is addressing. Number 3. \"Do not take the Lord's name in vain.\" That's the one she's broken. Your mom is not denying you the tickets because she's got a moral objection to Taylor. She's not doing it because God gives a solitary shit about what a pop singer does on a stage. She's doing it because she doesn't want to pay eight hundred to *thirteen* hundred bucks a pop, and she's using God as a meat shield because even she knows this is a fucked up thing to do.\n\nTLDR: Jesus would probably have a better time at a Taylor Swift concert than at your mom's house.

I think I have several very healthy relationships with my family, friends, and wife, but during the years there have been actions (probably on both sides) that Reddit's response would be to just cut them off (or for them to cut me off). Sometimes you can be an asshole in a situation without being a shitty person overall, you shouldn't burn bridges anytime something doesn't go your way or you will very quickly have no social support network whatsoever.", "The throwing around of the term \"gaslighting\" is so freaking annoying.  Someone appears to have lied?  Gaslighting. Didn't follow through on their word?  Gaslighting.  Didn't like what someone else said?

It's a pretty extreme form of manipulation that the average person isn't out there doing.", "My favourite thing about this 'rainbow' discourse, is that rainbows are also not allowed in the United Arab Emirates - my partner sells books so if he's working with any UAE-based bookshops he has to make sure not to send them anything that exceeds the rainbow limit (I think it's like more than 2 or 3 is not allowed, regardless of the topic of the book or age demographic).\n\nAnyway, I am not American and don't often encounter crazy conservatives but I would *eat up* the chance to play out a Regina George style conversation with them and enlighten them about these laws in the Middle East.\n\n*\"So you agree?

Perceived slights that just weren't a huge deal in the long run.

She was in a horribly traumatizing accident and was not given proper care because her mom doesn't believe in therapy, then in order to manipulate her into getting her driver's license her mom lied to her and promised something she's now going back on and using religion as a manipulation tool. Like Taylor's music is sinful but lying to your kid and manipulating them into doing what you want isn't?\n\nIt's for reasons like this that people end up going no contact with family members. It's not \"one perceived slight\" it's years of neglect and/or being mistreated where all of the smaller incidents add up to a huge issue.

The ability to go see Swifty in concert was the way you could overcome your severe trauma? How severe was it then?.. because I have some friends that were military-deployed, and they have legitimate severe trauma, which I don't think the opportunity to see their favorite musician/band live, would cure.\n\nSo, I agree with mom here, in the whole 'believing it' side of things. \n\nBut what she did, to back out of her side of the deal, especially under her own religious thoughts, is 1000% wrong. Wrong for backing out, wrong for claiming Swift is the devil or w/e crazy shit she wants to believe. \n\nI hope you do get to go to the show, and I hope you enjoy your new-found freedom of driving.

A LOT of kids don't feel ready for that and wait a bit (and it's 17 where I live!) but she demanded you do it, despite the trauma.  Also, she doesn't \"believe\" in therapy?
