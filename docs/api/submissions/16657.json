Josh was unkind to Penelope in the past, which caused our separation. However, one and a half years later, we made the decision to attempt to mend our relationship because we truly loved each other, Josh was no longer unkind to Penelope in the past, and we had three children together. (To emphasize, Penelope was omitted because she is not Josh's biological daughter.) \n\nThe issue starts right here: \nMy other children wanted to watch, too, as Penelope had been watching TV for VIRTUALLY the whole day. Josh handled everything because I was working at the time. A short while later, I hear Penelope screaming violently at Josh, so I went downstairs to see what was going on.  Basically, this is what she told me:\nJosh: P, stop staring at that TV, let your siblings watch.\nPenelope: After I finish this final episode, they can binge watch it till they pass out on the couch.\n\nKate apparently began sobbing excessively because she wanted to see her show. So, Josh stopped Penelope from finishing her episode and told her that she may continue it later before taking the remote and giving it to Kate That\u2019s when Penelope started yelling. \n\nHere's where I believe I am the a-hole:\nPenelope said that since I, not Josh, had purchased the couch, they could watch on the floor. We genuinely believed she was joking, but she wasn't kidding. I told her, we are family, and families share things. Then she began ranting about how Josh had never treated her like family and that, therefore, they aren't. Josh became irate and said she had been watching on the television he bought while he kept silent. \n\nI told her that it was true, so if she really intended to play that type of game, then be it. She broke down in tears and dumped an entire glass of juice on the couch. Josh and I were both angry and yelled at her to go to her room. Now that her grandmother has said I was too harsh on her, I am starting to question if I was the jerk. Oliver advised me to put this here so that others could judge whether or not I am the a-hole.

This is her trying to communicate to you that Josh is making her feel like she is not part of the family, and Josh saying \"I bought this TV\" is EXTREMELY unhelpful. \n\nTo quote the old saying \u201cThe child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.\u201d You are responsible for making sure your daughter feels loved and safe in her own home. You are failing. Fix it.", "Poor thing.  She's got four more years before she can escape?  Of course 'she's a teenager in every sense of the word', you've done her dirty.", "NTA at 14 she should have SOME emotional maturity (and more important: self control) and control her anger and not destroy stuff as a tantrum.  \n\nThat said, talk to your daughter, make sure she knows she will always be every bit as important as your other kids.  Because I think right now  she's not feeling that way.", "Because they were in love with each other, clearly a valid excuse", "No contact", "Yeah, that's pathetic. Just hoping for that girl to have a good family member to stay with.", "You should read through her other comments.  Hopefully you\u2019ll change your mind.", "Oh shit thanks!"]}
