Josh was unkind to Penelope in the past, which caused our separation. However, one and a half years later, we made the decision to attempt to mend our relationship because we truly loved each other, Josh was no longer unkind to Penelope in the past, and we had three children together. (To emphasize, Penelope was omitted because she is not Josh's biological daughter.) \n\nThe issue starts right here: \nMy other children wanted to watch, too, as Penelope had been watching TV for VIRTUALLY the whole day. Josh handled everything because I was working at the time. A short while later, I hear Penelope screaming violently at Josh, so I went downstairs to see what was going on.  Basically, this is what she told me:\nJosh: P, stop staring at that TV, let your siblings watch.\nPenelope: After I finish this final episode, they can binge watch it till they pass out on the couch.\n\nKate apparently began sobbing excessively because she wanted to see her show. So, Josh stopped Penelope from finishing her episode and told her that she may continue it later before taking the remote and giving it to Kate That\u2019s when Penelope started yelling. \n\nHere's where I believe I am the a-hole:\nPenelope said that since I, not Josh, had purchased the couch, they could watch on the floor. We genuinely believed she was joking, but she wasn't kidding. I told her, we are family, and families share things. Then she began ranting about how Josh had never treated her like family and that, therefore, they aren't. Josh became irate and said she had been watching on the television he bought while he kept silent. \n\nI told her that it was true, so if she really intended to play that type of game, then be it. She broke down in tears and dumped an entire glass of juice on the couch. Josh and I were both angry and yelled at her to go to her room. Now that her grandmother has said I was too harsh on her, I am starting to question if I was the jerk. Oliver advised me to put this here so that others could judge whether or not I am the a-hole.

Poor Penelope - I hope she can get out of there ASAP. She shouldn\u2019t have to live with an asshole who abused her just because your \u201chappiness\u201d is more important to you than hers. Your love and happiness should never come before or at the expense of your child\u2019s. My dear departed mama always put her happiness above my safety and well-being and I had to live with an abusive asshole for four years because every time I would point out that he was an abusive ass she would burst into tears and accuse me of destroying her happiness.

You\u2019re a bad mother. Also your comment on it being unfair to not have your husband around his three bio kids just because he was abusive to your bio kid is bullshit. YOU decided to get knocked up three times by an asshole. Give it four years, your daughter can finally escape.

You should never respond to your kids in anger. Especially Josh. P is doing the best she can, she can't help herself.\n\nIf you have a child/ren from a relationship/marriage that didnt work out...the worst thing you can do is selfishly get involved with another person to get between you and the child/ren.

Everything else after that doesn\u2019t matter.", "At face value, Penelope is behaving in a way that she earned getting yelled at and disliplined.

It sounds like she is still being treated unfairly by her step-father. Does he prevent her from using household things he's purchased? Does he exclude her from \"family\" activities?  You claim he's kind to her now, but how unkind was he before? That kind of stuff isn't easily forgiven and forgotten by children. \n\nPenelope is getting the short end of the stick here and I have a feeling you know it. Perhaps there is another family member Penelope can and would like to go live with for a while. She clearly doesn't feel loved and included in her own home.", "YTA. As a child who's mother did something similar, I hope you are ready to be without her as soon as she can legally get away.

No. The pain is worse because now Penelope has her mother choosing the man who was mean to her over protecting her. And it had to have been bad for your to break up over it.
