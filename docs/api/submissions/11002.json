It's YOUR wedding, not your aunt's. I've been to a couple dry weddings where either the bride or the groom or both were former alcoholics. Alcohol is not necessary to get married. Honestly, the only difference I noticed with the dry weddings is that there was a lot less drama, no one embarrassed themselves, and they tend to wrap up a little earlier. \n\nAnd as far as the age limit goes, I've been to a lot of child free weddings. Adding in the cost of everyone's children attending can become quite expensive, and you already mentioned that you've been saving for years.\n\nYou do you. It's your day (and your partner's of course).", "NTA, your wedding, your choice, and frankly you don't need to justify those choices. If your aunt wants to have a shit fit about it she can easily resolve her own problem by not coming. Plain and simple.\n\nMy sister had a dry wedding and requested no kids. The only person who didn't come was our alcoholic aunt, which was honestly a relief because she likes to cause scenes. It was no big deal, as it should be.", "NTA. \n\n>She proceeded to shout more and say well I need to pay for a babysitter and/or let her bring her own alcohol\n\nThis is nonsense.\n\n>I had multiple messages from multiple family members about how I was an asshole for hanging up and for not allowing children or alcohol at our wedding.\n\nIt's your wedding. If they want a drunken party involving children they can organise their own.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to explain to anyone why you don\u2019t want children under 10 or alcohol at your wedding, because it\u2019s your wedding. Not your Aunts or anyone else\u2019s. And if you did give your reasons, they\u2019re completely reasonable. \n\nI hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have an amazing day and a happy life together :)", "NTA\n\nUninvite your aunt and whoever is complaining about spending a day without alcohol", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules. If they don't like it, they don't have to attend.", "It\u2019s not that you *were* alcoholics. You *are* alcoholics. It\u2019s a very important distinction. \n\nNTA for what you asked. No kids means no kids. And if people can\u2019t celebrate your wedding without alcohol, you should rethink the importance they have in your life. You have to make a conscious decision every day to stay away from alcohol, and if friends or family have even a minuscule of an issue with that, and they can\u2019t be supportive wrt not consuming it on a day that\u2019s all about you two, then they shouldn\u2019t be in your life. \n\nImagine someone calling an alcoholic an asshole for having a dry wedding. The fucking audacity.\n\nCongrats on the wedding and sobriety!", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules. Your aunt doesn\u2019t have to come either. Actually, you may just want to add in the rule that no adults who act under 10 years old can come either.", "NTA. I really don't get people who can't go one afternoon without alcohol. Can't they just have fun being themselves?", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules. If they can't handle being sober for a few hours or paying for a sitter, they should stay home. If they need a party night away from their kids, they can do that any other night. It's your wedding. What you & your fiance want are the only opinions that matter. Your have fine nothing wrong.", "Omg NTA \n\nI don\u2019t understand why people flip out when alcohol isn\u2019t allowed at weddings. People have all kinds of reasons to choose not to serve alcohol, and if you *have to drink to have fun* it\u2019s time to talk to a 12 step. \n\nLots of people don\u2019t allow *any children* at their weddings. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nThey\u2019re welcome not to go if it\u2019s such a big problem.", "You get to decide what you want your wedding to be, they get to decide if they are attending or not. \n\nNTA. Pressuring you, screaming at you? Your aunt is the asshole, as are these other family members texting you.  If they don\u2019t like your plans they can either get over it, or not attend.", "NTA, but make sure you hire security for the wedding day to escort away the people that decide their wishes are more important than your wedding and show up with kids and booze in tow.", "Not. Not. Not.\n\nYour family is doing completely the wrong thing and you should immediately revoke the invitations of anyone who'd call you and yell after receiving an invitation. Disgraceful behavior.", "NTA\n\nUninvite Aunt's entire family.  She's not being nice and you don't need that treatment.", "NTA.  \nThe wedding is about getting married not about drinking alcohol.", "NTA I have three children and I have no problem with no children events.", "You said it yourself, you made those decisions for you own comfort. It\u2019s YOUR wedding so you should be able to decide what is and is not allowed  NTA", "NTA\nSome people won't come, just accept that.", "NTA- TL;DR your wedding your rules.", "NTA. The fact that it's *your* wedding is all the reason you need. They can do what they want at their own weddings.", "NTA- whose getting married here. You are \u2026. Not the family. It\u2019s a day to celebrate the foundations of a beautiful relationship between you and your partner \n\nCelebrate how you see fit", "NTA - It's your wedding, and you get to decide what you want or are comfortable with. \n\nIf people don't want to pay for a sitter, they don't have to. They can opt not to come to the wedding. \n\nIf people are upset that there won't be alcohol, that's okay, because they can opt not to come to the wedding. \n\nThat's kind of the awesome thing about invitations: we get to decide what we want to attend or not attend. Nobody has to come to your wedding, and if they decide that they'd rather miss your wedding than miss a glass of wine, then I guess that tells you all you need to know about their priorities.", "NTA sounds like alcoholism runs in the family...", "NTA you just have to graciously accept if some people cannot attend due to being unable to find childcare \n\nI think probably nobody was upset about the no under 10 rule, until the no alcohol rule, is because a lot of people like to take advantage of no kids to get drunk", "NTA\nIt\u2019s wild how many people can\u2019t function for a couple of hours without booze. Your aunt is being a jerk.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nVery odd behavior from the people in your life. \n\nI\u2019ve never understood the vitriol around dry weddings. I\u2019m an avid cocktail enthusiast. I drink responsibly and love being around it but I fully understand when people are uncomfortable. Geeze, it\u2019s a day to celebrate a union of two people. Booze is irrelevant. Even more so when the people involved in the wedding have trauma related.\n\nGosh, no you are definitely not AH. I hope you have a beautiful day!", "NTA. Weddings don\u2019t have to be an excuse to drink, and not having kids around doesn\u2019t mean you have to drink. Also, does alcohol magically make them able to afford childcare?", "I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening here. Even if there were alcohol at the wedding, parents would still need to find childcare. Why is the lack of alcohol at the wedding relevant? Is it because people would be more willing to get childcare for a boozy wedding \u2026 ?", "NTA. But I'd probably elope and simplify things. Babysitters are expensive, your family can't afford one in general (they should started saving when you said no kids at the wedding). Remove the scenario from their lives altogether and recentre the day on you, and not their complaints. Something tells me they're going to make your life difficult.", "NTA. You are allowed to have any kind of wedding you want.\n\nI must admit I'm frankly shocked at how many of these AITA posts about weddings, esp dry weddings and child free weddings, result in family members screaming at each other, calling people names like asshole, etc. Is the world just full of dysfunctional families? Or are those the only kind of families that post on AITA? I have never heard from so many stories where family members screaming at each other and name calling is the norm.\n\nIn my family, we avoided this kind of hostile wedding culture. No one in the family had a wedding. Our parents married at a registry office w/a few friends for witnesses, and they went out to a local restaurant afterwards. That's what all of us who got married did too. None of us had honeymoons either.\n\nYou let people know in advance about your conditions. They can of course disagree with what you want to do (though not scream at you about it), and they can always choose to not attend.\n\nNTA.", "I would elope and spend the money on a vacation. NTA. Sweet Mother of God why is alcohol the only drug we get bullied for NOT using? People want your whole medical history before they're okay with it. Absolute Madness.", "Absolutely NTA,  but if you don't want\n\n>loud noises or unpredictable behavior\nWhy not just grab the few people you want to actually celebrate with and go to the courthouse?", "NTA. These 2 things have nothing to do with each other. And both are perfectly reasonable to ask. If someone doesn\u2019t want to attend a wedding without alcohol they should realise drinking might be more of a problem than they thought. \n\nEven though you have some good explanations why you don\u2019t want children or alcohol there those explanations aren\u2019t even necessary. \n\nIf people don\u2019t want to attend or can\u2019t (due to lack of a babysitter) then they should tell you they aren\u2019t coming.", "Nta\n\nI like drinking\n\nI like social drinkings\n\nI tend to drink socially at a lot of functions.\n\nI have also enjoyed myself and had fun at a dry wedding. It's not a big deal.", "NTA It's your wedding and you get to make all the decisions, and have the wedding you want. Tbh, though, if I had young kids, and I was going to have a childfree night, I wouldn't be thrilled to be having a dry child-free night. I'm telling you that as a stranger on Reddit, though. If you were my friend or family member, I'd tell you I was very happy for you and super-excited to attend. Then, I'd have a great time at your wedding. Make sure you did, too, and hit up a bar before going back home to my kids!", "NTA.\n\nBut your wedding sounds boring AF", "NTA it's your wedding do what you want, but don't be surprised if people don't come. I would never attend a wedding that forced me to pay for a babysitter.", "Eloping probably would\u2019ve been a better idea.
