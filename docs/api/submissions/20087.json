Do you really think forcing something like this on your child is going to make them devote?  This is something they on their own need to decide.

If you care to keep having a relationship with you children past hitting 18, I highly suggest you stop trying to control their views of the world, themselves, etc. you do not own them, nor can you police their beliefs and actions to the extent you could when they were 12 anymore. they are grown adults. deal with it.
