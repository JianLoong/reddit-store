Do you really think forcing something like this on your child is going to make them devote?  This is something they on their own need to decide.

If you care to keep having a relationship with you children past hitting 18, I highly suggest you stop trying to control their views of the world, themselves, etc. you do not own them, nor can you police their beliefs and actions to the extent you could when they were 12 anymore. they are grown adults. deal with it.

Maybe not specifically in the Bible (I never read it all the way through and it's been a long time since I read any of it on my own,) but a lot of churches preach obsessively about spreading the word of God, to anyone whether they want to listen or not. It's so scary hearing how so many people practice this \"religion\" and then blatantly and willingly ignore it's most basic teachings, and not to mention the rampant contradictory nature of it all; Love thy neighbor as they are, but do whatever it takes to get them to convert and love and fear God.

Nursing homes, anssisted living etc. are very expensive, like $7000 a month. Piss off those daughters, and you may find they have better places to spend their money. Tread lightly, mom. \n\nMy mother worked very hard to burn all her bridges with me while she was alive. When she got cancer, I was the only one of her three sons, who stepped up, took care of her, got her into a very nice nursing home that I worked with so I could trust them, and then I paid for her grotesquely expensive nursing home bill. But that\u2019s because I\u2019m one of those kind non-Christian woke people, not out of some sense of loyalty. \n\nMy two bum brothers were and are still quite useless when the chips are down. After their disappearing act, when my mother died, I had had enough. So in a way, my mother\u2019s poor treatment of me led to her three sons, never wanting to be within a country mile of each other.

Yeah, that's faith.\n\nIf the five of us, one is an atheist, one is right wing Evangelical Christian, I believe but I don't go to church, because I believe in the scripture that says close the door and pray in private.\n\nThe youngest and oldest died without going back to church.\n\nMom's 92, and only once in a while asks if I'll go to church with her.
