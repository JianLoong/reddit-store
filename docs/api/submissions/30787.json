Or do you want things to work?  After all, she is the children's grandmother, right?\n\nYou can't have both.\n\nYou could write her an apology letter.  You don't even have to say \"you were right\" or anything like that.  You could simply stick to something like \"I apologize that I forgot to thank you at the time you sent the card.  It is something that is a social norm and it won't happen again.\"  Technically correct, but you're still getting to maintain your emotional distance.  You could keep it very business like and stick strictly to what went \"wrong\" at the time.\n\nYou're NOT ta for honestly being too exhausted and overwhelmed at the time.  But there are better ways to deal with it than what you did.", "I was gonna say e s h but NTA life happens and we often get busy. Also it's not uncommon for in a couple \n from what I've seen from family and friends for one to thank on behalf of their partner. The fact that she blew up over that is pretty ridiculous. Her attitude wasn't needed and to demand a thank you was outrageous. If his mom really cut contact over that then you're better off without.", "YTA if you haven\u2019t tried to reach out for years. But so is she. It\u2019s ridiculous for the two of you to not have bridged this issue. So suck it up and extend an olive branch.", "YTA. Maybe we are missing a lot more context about your MILs behavior and personality. However in my opinion, you're far too old to 'refuse' to thank somebody for a very gracious gift simply because they called you out. You even said you intended to thank her, which tells me you knew it was the right thing to do. \n\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but working full time is something that literally millions of people in the world have to do so I really don't buy it as an excuse for not having time to thank somebody.

If they do not, I understand that their lives are complicated and sometimes very difficult , and because I love them all, I let it go.\n\n**Your MIL is not reacting normally at all.**  ***Your husband thanked her for you both.  That's normal and enough.***  For her to demand more gratitude, and disregard your needs too, it's ridiculous and not thinking of your lives at all.\n\nFor her to take this and punish you all for years with her silent treatment, I'm guessing this is a person that is more about the control, than about the love.  For such a person, let them go.  They will never be pleased with less than total compliance to their wants, and that doesn't happen for anyone.  Appeasing them doesn't work for long, because they want more control, when they get any.", "YTA\n\nDo a quick Google search for Miss Manners.

Sweets for the kids, a new lock to replace a busted or rusted out one, some flowers for christmas decorations. If she wants to gloat, show her how far that $200 can really go.", "NTA in my books\n\nYou were too busy trying to work to personally thank her. She was still thanked by your husband, so it's not like the gift went ignored. It is her choice not to be involved in the lives of her grandchildren and if it's over a \u00a3200 gift card, then she might not have been that invested in them in the first place. Gifts are meant to be given with expectations of nothing in return and, while it's nice to be thanked especially if a lot of money is involved, to take it that far is stupid.\n\nI think you should broach the comments of 'sucking it up' with your husband and calmly explain why it's upsetting to hear, remind him of why you didn't get the chance to thank her personally. Don't let that kind of thing pass as it'll just build up over time and eventually boil over into a bigger argument.\n\nI will say, if you've decided not to thank her on principle after all these years of nothing, then you're a bit of an AH, but other than that I can't see how you were in the wrong here", "NTA it sounds like the relationship isn\u2019t very close, I really do think in that situation that the other partner can thank on behalf of both of you\u2026mailing a $200 gift card isn\u2019t like buying you a new house.

Are they dictating how YOU spend your money that you work hard for? \n\nNot sure how old they are but I am guessing you are hoping for something in their will... it looks like you have already made your bed over something so petty. \n\nThis decision of yours is now impacting your children's relationship with their grandparents.

It's clear she's overreacted insanely over not getting a personal thank you during your busiest time of year.\n\nOnce you knew she wanted the thanks though, it's an AH thing not to thank someone for a gift. It's stupid, and mostly meaningless, but that's why you both suck. It's a small thing you could have done to make her happy after she sent you $200 you all could use.  You take the money, you say thanks.\n\nWhen you don't want that type of person holding things over you, the easiest way to deal with it is simply not to take stuff from them.", "Huge NTA. That MIL is so entitled that her ego doesn't fit in her probably already big house.

I used to be big on thank you cards, but we both work full-time and get busy. We always acknowledge it though, I think that\u2019s what she is annoyed about. My sister-in-law doesn\u2019t personally thank my parents for anything, but my parents continue to buy for her because she is the mom of the grandkids, and they don\u2019t want to upset her.

She's always been the type of person to do things like give the biggest, most expensive gift at the baby shower, or give my kids the most birthday gifts out of everyone at the party...but it's only because she wants everyone to see \"how great and generous\" she is. Like, she would never be the type of person to send an anonymous gift, or make an anonymous donation she does these things solely for the praise and attention.", "Yeah, I am old school and it costs nothing to shoot out a thanks to someone.
