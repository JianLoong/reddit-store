That's normal and enough.***  For her to demand more gratitude, and disregard your needs too, it's ridiculous and not thinking of your lives at all.\n\nFor her to take this and punish you all for years with her silent treatment, I'm guessing this is a person that is more about the control, than about the love.  For such a person, let them go.  They will never be pleased with less than total compliance to their wants, and that doesn't happen for anyone.

Gifts are meant to be given with expectations of nothing in return and, while it's nice to be thanked especially if a lot of money is involved, to take it that far is stupid.\n\nI think you should broach the comments of 'sucking it up' with your husband and calmly explain why it's upsetting to hear, remind him of why you didn't get the chance to thank her personally. Don't let that kind of thing pass as it'll just build up over time and eventually boil over into a bigger argument.\n\nI will say, if you've decided not to thank her on principle after all these years of nothing, then you're a bit of an AH, but other than that I can't see how you were in the wrong here", "NTA it sounds like the relationship isn\u2019t very close, I really do think in that situation that the other partner can thank on behalf of both of you\u2026mailing a $200 gift card isn\u2019t like buying you a new house.

If it wasn't over the thank you, it would have been over some other perceived slight.", "<<my husband FaceTimed his mom with our kids to thank her for the gift>>  \nthem AND the kids.  So mil got at least 3 thank you's for one gift.(not sure how many kids OP has)", "I wonder if you/your husband would appreciate reading Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.  I know I really appreciated it, and I recommend it on here all the time.", "You don't want this kind of manipulation being used on your kids either. Love shouldn't be removed over such a small grievance.", "They're probably better off for it, sadly. Imagine doing to one of your kids what she did to you? Imagine one of them asking you why grandma doesn't like her after she didn't get her ass properly kissed for a sweater in the wrong size?", "Thank you\ud83d\ude2d.", "It\u2019s obviously a joke \ud83d\ude44", "Thank you. I wish us Americans could get equal time one day.", "I would encourage your husband to quietly keep contact with him if possible.", "I totally agree!", "My maternal grandparents used to visit us and bring my mother groceries every Friday when I was growing up. My mother has helped me plenty of times as well, but sometimes doesn't even tell me. Like, log into my electric bill account and pay it. I won't notice til I log in and see that it's paid. I can't imagine my mom cutting off all contact if I didn't acknowledge it for whatever reason.  But that's the difference.  My mom does it because she's kind. MIL just wants to talk about how much she does for everyone.", "She won't be mad at all.", "> NTA but how mad will u be if husband and kids are out of the will?\n\nAlmost as mad as MIL will be as she rots in a nursing home, visited every week by her dearest wallet.", "Maybe I am the crazy person but I read her post and her comments. She stated that her MIL has often gone period of times without speaking to both of her children. So maybe I am biased as a mother but I couldn\u2019t imagine going long periods of time without speaking to my children. I am the parent, you can agree to disagree but that means I will always call them, I will always go to see them and I will always show up for them if they need it. \n\nThey didn\u2019t ask to be brought into this world, they owe my husband and I nothing and we owe them everything. So it\u2019s disgraceful that a parent can choose to go years without speaking to their children especially knowing how short life can be over something so petty. \n\nThey would never have to worry about me throwing my help in their face especially if they have always paid me back. \n\nAlso the MIL gave a family gift and the husband and children called to specifically thank her for the gift on behalf of the entire family. Again, agree to disagree but my husband and I have often sent thank you\u2019s on behalf of both of us and we have never had someone get angry or cut us off. \n\nI will never agree with any of you, if a mother chooses to stop speaking to her son and grandchildren because she didn\u2019t get a proper thank you from her DIL I can tell who the problem is.", "I understood your response I am just throughly confused by it and others as well. My husband and I have been a unit for the past 10 years. We have been receiving joint or family gifts from both sides of our family for almost that same amount of time. My husband sometimes thanks people on the behalf of both of us and I do the same. We don\u2019t always both thank someone for a gift and we have never had someone upset. Why because one of us wasn\u2019t present or maybe just busy. \n\nYes, we were both raised with manners. So if it\u2019s a family gift and one member of said family is busy why can\u2019t the husband or wife send a thank you on behalf of the entire family?", "Yeah, that wouldn't have pissed her off\ud83d\ude02\n\nHer: unloading mounds of birthday gifts from her car\n\nMe: \"Nope. We can't accept those.Take them back\"", "It was more like,  being busy made me not thank her right away, but my ADHD made me completely forget after a couple days. I probably would have remembered next time my husband talked to her while I was home like \"omg, thank you so much for the gift card.  I've been so busy I forgot to tell you!\" But she didn't give me a chance to remember. Her getting so bent out of shape over it made me not want to appease her.", "This. This book explained so much for me!", "I\u2019m listening to it on audible thanks to one of your previous mentions and it\u2019s excellent. Thank you! Highly recommended.", "Never apologize to an abuser for refusing to be abused and manipulated, and silent treatment like this is 100% an abuse tactic. You are doing great, DH could use some therapy it sounds like though.", "There you go. You, DH, and kiddies have a loving mother and grandmother. \ud83d\udc95\n\nIt's difficult not to make comparisons, isn't it?\n\nYou're all fortunate to have such a kind mom in your lives. I'm relieved.", "In this case, the fianc\u00e9 was having a casual conversation with the mother and mentioned it. I\u2019m not suggesting they needed to run out and use calligraphy on Crane stationary - but OP doesn\u2019t come across as having any class. A $200 gift card is generous - deserved more than a passing comment by the son.", "Do you see how that behavior and this one are different? If you accept her gift she\u2019s entitled to be thanked by you.", "Honestly you both sound tiring in different ways if you were that petty to let it be the reason you didn't thank her. What? To prevent her from morally superior? By your account she'll feel that way either way. You may not care but this is effecting your husband and maybe children.", "\u201cA passing comment by the son?\u201d Did we read the same thing? \n\nIt was a 200 gift card for the entire family, so 50 per family member? That is not the most generous gift I have ever seen received or given. Yes it\u2019s the thought that counts but so is any gift given. I wouldn\u2019t feel the need to hound the entire family for an individual thank you. The husband or wife saying thank you for the entire family could suffice. \n\nThe son and children FaceTimed his mother to thank her for the gift card that was for the entire family. How do you consider that a passing comment? They purposefully called her to thank her.", "Yeah lol.  I definitely don't remember saying anything about him just thanking her as an afterthought during an unrelated conversation \ud83d\ude02. He FaceTimed her SPECIFICALLY to thank her for the gift card, then  him and the kids most likely had a 45+ minute conversation with her following the \"thank yous\"", "I went back to re-read the post, and I actually did miss the FaceTiming part! My bad. I don\u2019t know\u2026I just get a sense that there\u2019s underlying resentment on the part of OP just in general, regarding the MIL. The whole post starts out with the observation that the in-laws are \u201cextremely well off not that that matters\u201d (sic) and it goes downhill from there. OP sounds resentful but, MIL looks like she\u2019s looking for a fight. Toxic dysfunctional family stuff\u2026", "With the wife notably absent. Weird.", "I completely understand, you don\u2019t have to explain it to me. I don\u2019t mind getting downvoted, I just really wanted someone to explain to me why they disagree with you and why it isn\u2019t acceptable for your husband to send a thank you for the family. I am also not sure why they think you are ungrateful or an AH. \n\nYes my husband and I are individual people but we have been a family unit for over a decade. We have attended events alone while representing each other and we have given and received gifts and said thank you on behalf of both us. \n\nWe received wedding gifts, house warming gifts and baby shower gifts in the last two years and there have been instances when one of us sincerely thanked someone from the both of us and no one was upset about that. \n\nSince I can read and have comprehension skills I understood that your husband and children called and gave a heartfelt thank you for a family gift. I feel as though that should suffice since you were busy but it was on your behalf as well. Yes if you remembered to thank her again on your own that\u2019s great if not your husband already took care of it. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why this isn\u2019t a thing.", "I think her adding the well of part was to emphasize her MILs personality. Some of us do know people who are well off and they are rude and come off entitled because of it. I am by no means saying that everyone who has money behaves this way. If you read her comments her MIL has helped them but they have always paid her. \n\nShe also talks about her MIL going periods of time without speaking to both of her children. I maybe taking it personally but I could never do that to my children. I would also never throw it in their face that I helped them in a time of need. \n\nWe are only reading her side but by her comments her MIL does sound toxic and slightly narcissistic. I have a mother like this and it can be extremely difficult and exhausting to manage at times.", "I guess at this point it\u2019s okay to agree to disagree. It still hasn\u2019t been explained to me why it\u2019s weird. \n\nMy soon to be husband at the time and I received housewarming gifts in 2021. I was busy with a hectic work schedule and wedding planning. My HUSBAND went in person to sincerely thank everyone who helped us or bought gifts for us on behalf of both of us. This is something that he wanted to do in person. No one was upset or blocked us or decided to stop speaking to us because I wasn\u2019t with him.", "Oh, I knew you understood!\ud83d\ude0a I was commenting in agreeance and to confirm that what you said to the person who commented about it being a \"casual conversation \" was correct. Sorry,  I should have replied to them, not you.", "Guess I come full circle\u2026.thinking of my own (ex) MIL and how she rarely visited us and didn\u2019t spend a dime on her grandchild (our kid)\u2026.I\u2019ve blocked out a lot of it. \ud83d\ude33", "\ud83e\udd23 don\u2019t you worry, misunderstandings happen sometimes. \n\nI will continue to get downvoted and stand in solidarity with you. I just don\u2019t understand anyone\u2019s objection to your husband and children saying thank you on your behalf. \n\nYou are not an AH and I could be wrong but your MIL sounds toxic. Nothing is worth having that in your life, however I do feel sympathy for your husband and children. I have toxic family members and my parents are tough, for my sanity I had to put up boundaries when dealing with them. I do things on my terms and I am happier. It has helped me become a better wife and mother.", "I completely understand, I think sometimes I can be completely biased. I have an amazing MIL and FIL and my husband is their 32yo baby (youngest child) \ud83e\udd23 so they absolutely spoil our son. They are amazing parents and grandparents to all of their children and grandchildren but my husband and our son are the youngest so even his siblings baby both of them to a certain degree. \n\nMy husband has an amazing relationship with his mother and I have known her since I was about 14 so I can admit I don\u2019t always understand the bad dynamics that can exist between MILs and DILs. I am aware that I got extremely lucky."]}
