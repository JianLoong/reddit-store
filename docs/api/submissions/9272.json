He said he could have tried to get a week off beforehand, but honestly I think it takes more than a week for the smell to go away, and besides, I knew that they don't really allow much time off during the busy season.\n\nHe asked if I couldn't have just scheduled the wedding during the time of the year he wouldn't have farm work, but I don't feel like I can (or should have to) plan my life around him, this is what worked for us.

Even the choice to not invite him because his job makes him unavailable at that time in your eyes isn't that bad.\n\nBut you have to fucking tell your brother.

He acknowledged the potential detriment to his social life and considered the pay off to be adequate. That was his choice, and weddings are part of his social life that he may miss out on.\n\nTo be honest, any sibling would be upset at not being invited, but you can be upset and still recognise that the reason given is fair. You don\u2019t want the day overshadowed by uncomfortable guests and the smell of livestock in the venue & soft furnishings, and you\u2019re clearly thinking of him in that it would likely end up in him being embarrassed when/if people make comments about the smell.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame it couldn\u2019t be scheduled to allow him to attend but like you said, that isn\u2019t your priority to accommodate and plenty of other elements (such as price, availability of the majority of guests, your own life and schedule) come into the choice when considering the date of the wedding.\n\nNo assholes here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
