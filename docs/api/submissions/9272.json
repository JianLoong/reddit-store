Most farm houses are built with a boot room on the entrance so they can strip boots and overalls without going into their clean house while farm workers have to get in their cars and drive home like that so the smell will get into upholstery and be transferred back onto them even when they're clean so you do have a valid criticism.\nHowever you most definitely are YTA because you didn't even warn him or give him chance to come up with a solution.

Eventually their counselor brought up the smell and they were embarrassed but tried to clean up - they still smelled even after showering and wearing \"clean\" clothes. I think unfortunately it's a real issue for people who are \"in it\" all day, every day. But I imagine with a couple days away and perhaps clothes that are not stored in the same area as where they live or work, it will get better. The smell can't linger forever!", "I had a friend that worked I a pork processing plant, and same thing with him. The smell would linger, even if he showered/changed clothes. He eventually found a solution that included always having short hair, he had work clothes that where exclusively for work, he even had a separate car that he would use only for going to/from work. His work clothes would  get cleaned at a laundromat to avoid contaminating his non work clothes etc. \n\nIt took a lot of work on his part, but he was eventually able to come up with a system where he didn't smell like death at all times.", "Honey... where TF do you think your food comes from? Who do you think scrapes your clogged-up, shit-filled sewers and septic tanks? Who do you think handles your garbage? Do you think the gas and oil in your heater magically teleport out of the ground? Do you suppose then when your car needs repairs, some magical, hygienic fairies wave a wand and replace your gunked-up radiator?\n\nPeople do dirty jobs. Then they wash off and rejoin the society they keep running. They do more valuable work than any tie-wearing dipshit in a corner office. And if they smell a bit (which I highly, HIGHLY doubt they do) that's because they're doing the dirty work your pretty little child hands can't be bothered to touch. \n\nYTA. Go outside.", "Oh FFS. Nobody in your family ever heard of taking the day off?\n\nYTA", "YTA bridezilla", "YTA\nDang OP, there\u2019s ways to get him clean. Not inviting your BROTHER? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Can anyone say \u201cBridezilla\u201d?! YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re very mean and owe your brother a massive apology though I don\u2019t think it would mend all the mean things you say to him I can\u2019t imagine what else you\u2019ve done to him", "Yep people don't understand just how bad OP's brother is going to smell, even after multiple showers.", "Yeah, of course she doesn\u2019t have to schedule her wedding around her brothers job. \n\nBut if she actually wanted him to be there she could have!  Next will be a post whining that her super rich brother didn\u2019t buy them a gift", "You're underestimating the realities of an industrial pig farm. The smell doesn't come out when you shower, lol.", "...they actually do, though. OP's brother definitely stinks terribly, to the point where everyone within 10 feet of him at the wedding would notice.", "I'm on the fence about the judgment, but I do think most commenters here straight-up don't realize how some smells just soak in and don't leave. OP clearly knows what she's talking about in her brother's case and everyone's assuming it can't be true and she's saying this stuff to be a jerk. Naw man. Some jobs make you smell long-term. It's tough but it's true.", "Sorry but the campus pig farm is NOTHING compared to the big industrial farms where OP's brother works. The smell doesn't just come out....", "Yeah I think these comments that are like \"nooooo my friend had a pig farm and they didn't smell\" are just clueless. There's a huge difference between a family farm operation with some pigs and an industrial pig farm. \n\nThe only reason I could see YTA is that OP could've scheduled the wedding for a time when her brother wasn't working. But I don't blame her at all for not wanting her guests to dry heave the entire reception.", "My husband and I volunteered in public education at a zoo. We were around a lot of keepers. I do not recall any of them stinking when we saw them after hours once they\u2019d had a chance to shower and change. That said, we didn\u2019t have otters, so I wouldn\u2019t know about them. At any rate, it never occurred to me to ban them from my husband\u2019s funeral when he died suddenly. \n\nOP, YTA; most definitely.", "Same except I was the butcher and my husband a mechanic.  Raw meat and motor oil, what a mix!", "My grandmother's side of the family lives on a farm and a long hot shower with a good scrub brush takes care of it just fine. OP seems to not understand people typically shower before fancy events.", "Apparently the smell of rutting goats is near impossible to get out of clothes. Source: an ex who did post-doc research on rutting goats", "TBF I don't think he's wearing his work clothes to a wedding.", "NTA. Because I know the smell you're talking about. It's HORRENDOUS!!  Pig farmers can't get the smell off them. It follows them everywhere!! \n\nFor all the YTA's out there, honestly it would ruin her wedding. Just imagine the smell of shit permeating a 20ft square area. And when he leaves that area, it will stay there and than follow him everywhere he goes. It will 100% ruin the evening. They bathe and bathe and bathe, but it literally takes weeks for the smell to disappear from their SKIN and hair. \n\nThe pig farmers in the areas i drive through is horrible. The smell encompasses miles and miles of land. \n\nMaybe there's a spa that might bezble to help kill the smell? A dermatologist? Maybe do.some research to see if there is any new options available.  \n\nBut unfortunately,  you're not wrong.", "it seems he wouldn\u2019t be wearing the same clothes to the literal farm as he does to a wedding...", "Yeah, it's not easy for him to clean up. People commenting here are clueless. Pigs are a million times worse than cows, and the stench lingers. Also, this isn't a cute family farm with some pigs. This is an industrial farm, likely with thousands of pigs in horribly unsanitary conditions. A shower or two isn't going to cut it..... \n\nI think OP is YTA because they should've scheduled the wedding for a different time. But I don't blame her for not wanting the gagging stench of pigs while people are trying to eat at the reception.", "This is SO TRUE. It\u2019s like how a mechanic can wash and wash and wash, but it takes months for the grease to disappear.", "Fingers crossed, eh?", "I know a lot of people who work on pig, cattle, whatever farms. \n\nI have never been to a wedding where someone smelled like a pig or a cow.", "It's probably on the clothes and shoes.  Laundering normally doesn't always take care of the smell.  When my father had a stinky job (cleaning fish) he had clothes and shoes just for work, and they were laundered separately from everything else.  Brother would be wearing a suit or tux and dress shoes to the wedding, so smelly work clothes won't be a problem.", "By contrast, been married 19 years, together since we were teenagers, and had a huge fancy wedding with all of our friends and family. I\u2019m still really, just totally in love with him. So I guess it varies.", "Now this is just not true with industrial sized farms. It permeates for MILES, it gets inside your car, it\u2019s AWFULLLL. \n\n-enc", "I referred to this once as \"giving your tap a handjob\" and got a funny look", "Incredibly accurate \ud83d\ude02"]}
