NTA*\n\n*You're making assumptions about the job details (anything that starts with \"I think\").  Escort him out if he smells like shit, but at least give him the opportunity to attend.", "YTA. He isn't planning to attend while smelling like a farm. This seems like it's about you thinking less of him because of his job.", "I struggle to believe that a long bath, hair wash and aftershave wouldn't make him smell acceptable. But he is willing to lose a week' pay because he wants to attend your wedding. Presumably a lot of money from what you describe. YTA.", "Major YTA. \n\nNot inviting your own brother to your wedding because of his choice of job. You sound entitled and controlling. Not to mention oblivious to how this would make your own brother feel and most likely permanently damage your relationship going forward.", "Op thats a mean nasty thing to do YTA", "very different but it still kinda reminds me of the zookeeper SO story", "YTA I\u2019m sure I speak for everyone when I say we would all rather be around him and his \u201cdisgusting\u201d smell then your disgusting personality.", "YTA because you didn't even talk it over with him. I have known plenty of people in the wide array of agricultural careers and I've never known a stench that lingers that hard on someone. There are also tons of odor elimination options for people. Strong scented soaps, body washes, colognes, and even things like clothing sprays.\n\nYou needed to have a conversation with him. You seems like a really shitty brother for this.", "Seriously\u2026 what is wrong with you? That\u2019s your brother, a hard working productive man, and you\u2019re shitting all over it because you don\u2019t like how it makes him smell or what it does to his social life? Frankly, your attitude reeks way worse than a farm boy ever could, even if he forgoes all showers during his working period. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA a thousand times over. Also, I give respect to your brother for working hard and caring enough about your wedding to try and make arrangements to be fresh & clean on the big day. Maybe he\u2019s better off without you in his life.", "YTA", "YTA but another asshole who everyone universally agrees is an asshole and does not dare show up in the comments.", "Yta, do you think he just doesn't shower or clean his clothes at all because of your job? You're the reason he's being ostracized, NOT because of his job. Tf is the matter with you? Do you have no logic?", "YTA Do showers not exist where you are?", "YTA.\n\nThis is actually such a sad post ... it seems like your brother genuinely wants to come and figure out a solution, and you are here up on your high horse, criticizing and kicking him. Be better! Invite him and apologize.", "YTA. Your brother showers and dons clean clothes, right? Do you have an issue with all farm and ranch workers the same way? Because it sounds like bias on your part, not like \"my brother never showers.\" The giveaway is \"it ruins his social life.\"\n\nOf course your brother is hurt. He has every right to be. Examine your thoughts and motivations and please consider them carefully.", "OP, I am not so sure that your brother is actually the one that stinks here. He shouldn't stand near you at the wedding, he won't like it. Maybe you should take a week or two to straghten up your priorities and cleansen your mind. YTA.", "YTA", "Your attitude stinks more then 10 pig farms.", "Yta", "YTA", "YTA and a judgmental one at that. You don't like his job because it's manual farm labor. Bet you don't think about it when you sit down to eat that every single meal you consume has people working under the same conditions as your brother.\n\nAn extended shower with decent soap, shampoo and a clean set of clothes that has not been around his work clothes is all he needs to be presentable for your wedding. No week of necessary. Admit it to yourself: You don't want him at your wedding because you are ashamed of what he does for a living. YTA big time!", "YTA  he\u2019s an adult and I\u2019m sure he showers.. you are just expecting him to stink cause he works on a farm?! \nAnd you have NO idea how he smells.. you\u2019re just going off the thought of him smelling.. he\u2019ll shower and be in clean clothes.. \ngiant YTA", "YTA\n\nI can't stand people who think farmers are 'gross' because of the smell. My father worked at a pig farm for most of my childhood and sometimes I'd get to go with him. Yes he smelt bad when he came home but he was still my dad and he never smelt when we went out because shock and horror! He knew how to shower and I'm sure your brother does too \n\nBesides if it's a good place that takes care of it's animals you should be proud of the work he does, it's important work and it's hard work.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re judging what he chooses to do to make money and if he\u2019s happy doing it and gets paid good money then good for him! \n\nDon\u2019t make out like people who work with animals always smell, even after showering and putting on fresh clothes, because they don\u2019t. You just don\u2019t want him there.", "Goats smell lush. \n\nTheir 5 stomachs mean it's not smelly waste if composted efficiently in a timely fashion. \n\nMuck spreading pig muck is vile but pigs are lovely, intelligent beautiful beings. \n\nOP, YTA. You shouldn't have put your wedding when it's birthing season. Tis the same with the seasons. You know this.", "I don't know how you can write this whole post and not feel like an AH. Do you even like your brother?", "Or maybe the brother makes an arbitrary rule to exclude her from his wedding.", "> Are goats/pigs/chickens worse?\n\nPigs are by far the worst when it comes to smell. You can stand a good kilometer or 2 downwind of a pig farm and it will still make you gag if you're not used to it.\n\nThat said, a week off, with a lot of thorough cleaning (both body and clothes), and he should be totally fine to go to a wedding. Hell, the clothing he should be wearing to the wedding shouldn't ever go near a pig farm anyway, so those should be clean already. There's no need to ever wear your sunday's best to the farm.", "No. He works manual labor on a farm, so he is gross!", "I sincerely appreciate your comment because everyone here is so casual about SMELLING a grown man. Yes, showers exist, but he obviously isn't bathing properly or taking additional steps to kill the urine/waste that he is being sprayed with at work...My guess is he is a single man, working hard, falling asleep and coming right back to work in those same filthy clothes/boots/jeans, but thinking a quick rinse and a change of undies does the job...", "You are only the third person aside from myself who understands the gravity of a breath-stealing stench. I said NAH because she did talk to her Brother about the smell once before (though she should have had another conversation with him before invites went out) and I believe he does have some hygiene shortfalls bc he could bathe/scrub with natural remedies to cut the smell.", "I have found a 4th person who agrees with NAH. It appears most here have not been around truly offending smells nor have they had to tell a grown adult they smell-it is sad and awkward. I do think the brother has a bit of a hygiene issue, because he could cut it down if he bathed daily and used some natural remedies.", "The difference is that OP and fianc\u00e9 likely took other things into account when scheduling their wedding.\n\nFeb 12? \u201cParents anniversary\u201d\n\n\nMarch 22? \u201cNieces birthday\u201d\n\n\nMay 1? \u201cInternational Workers Day\u201d\n\n\nLast weekend of May? \u201cNot on a 3 day weekend\u201d\n\n\nOct 9th? \u201cBest Man is out of the country that month\u201d\n\n\nJuly when brother stinks? \u201cYes. **I shouldn\u2019t have to** change the day just because my brothers insists on this job\u201d\n\n\nWe all did this calculus when we scheduled our wedding.

But he\u2019s an asshole for not. \n\n\n\nYTA.", "Ah the 5th NAH and I completely agree with you as I have dealt with being around a person with an offending smell and it is difficult and embarrassing. No one wants to smell another grown person. I do believe the brother may have a bit of a hygiene issue as well because he could get it together with some serious effort and natural remedies. She also should have told him beforehand that she was not inviting him. Anyway, excellent and fair comment you made here...", "What if her brother has a hygiene issue, isn't washing off the animal waste/urine properly, or is too tired at the end of his shift and figures \"why bother I'm just going to smell again tomorrow\"?... I think she should have had another sincere conversation with her Brother before the invites went out and didnt handle this situation like a loving Sister should.

I may be projecting because a close family member had that issue. However the fact that she ever smelled him means that he is not showering/bathing after work...she certainly doesn't strike me as the type to go out to the farm to see him after work everyday lol.", "It is, but it\u2019s not like 1 person can stink up the whole wedding unbearably - not that I know. Like, with decent hygiene, you would notice if you are relatively close, but not to the point it would make you gag - and I am sensitive to smell. But again, that is my experience, and even if it is worse than that, I just think that people tend to loose way to much touch with reality when it comes to weddings. It\u2019s life, not a fairy tail, things are bound to be imperfect and it\u2019s not worth it to endanger your relationships over that\u2026 But, oh well, that\u2019s just my view.", "Add some Lysol to your laundry and take showers.

They only finish the hogs, they don't breed them, but I can't imagine it's the breeding that causes the stench. \n\nJust for another point of view.", "Makes me wonder if brother has hygiene issues that are exacerbated by being around animal waste. To not invite someone because they smell terrible isn\u2019t a step to take lightly.\n\n\nThat said, could also be OP\u2019s fiance and/or future in laws are classist assholes, or she thinks farm work is somehow beneath her and sees him as less of a person. I\u2019d want to know more to this story, because it sounds like she\u2019s the AH, but if brother really can\u2019t bother to bathe properly, it\u2019s understandable.", "My best friend as a kid grew up on a hog farm, and you couldn\u2019t even smell the hogs on the property unless you went inside the barn.\n\nOP, YTA, big time"]}
