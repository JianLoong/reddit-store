They are willing to HELP him, with the agreement he pays it back.  This has nothing do do with you.\n\nAlso, I'd argue their financial situation has changed.  When you were applying to colleges, they were supporting 2 teenagers at home.   Now that you are in college, and getting it paid for, they are only supporting one.  So all the food, clothes, etc. that they were paying for while you were at home, has been freed up now.  This isn't uncommon.

And they know that he needs more help along the way.   \n\nShouldn't the desired end result that you and your brother are both successful adults?  If he gets a no interest loan from your parents to achieve that, and you got scholarships, does it really matter?  Especially because you'll leave college with no loans, and he'll have to be paying them back.  Isn't that you coming out ahead in the end?\n\nI've experienced something like this.  After I graduated college, my mom told me I had 6 months to get out or start paying rent.  I got out.  It was a bit of a kick that I needed to leave the nest.  My little brother, has been living there rent free for 10+ years.  I once brought it up to her and she said \"I knew by giving you that deadline, you'd be fine.  If I kick him out, I don't have the same faith that he will be\".   Is that \"fair\" to me?  No.  Do I get it?  Absolutely.", "That just doesn't happen sometimes.  For many reasons.  But there are many oldest kids who can tell stories of things they didn't get, but then their younger siblings got it when they were that age.  Different kids have different needs.", "BINGO, or he just doesn\u2019t or \u201ccan\u2019t afford to\u201d", "And that is how you end up estranged from your kids.  When it could have been equal yet you provide one kid with spam and the other with wagyu.  That is the perfect formula for resentment and estrangement.  It also practically guarantees your kids have no relationship with each other when you\u2019re gone.  \n\nI get that things can\u2019t always be exactly equal.  Sometimes financial circumstances are that different\u2014ex: the family used to have money but now we don\u2019t.  But if one child has had dramatically different while another is now getting \u2018better\u2019, then it needs to be equalized in some way\u2014meaning $$ available for something for the kid who didn\u2019t get.  Assuming the kid don\u2019t earn scholarships, I wouldn\u2019t have an oldest kid with hella school loans, but pay for the younger to attend with no loans.  Id pay as much as I could for younger while also paying a chunk on the older\u2019s student loans, and youngest would have to take out remainder in loans.  Both kids would get help and both kids would have loans.  Neither would get all of their education paid for all by me if I couldn\u2019t contribute to both in an almost equal way.", "I don't think she wants a loan though. \n\nLook, the fact is, just because a parent couldn't do something for an older sibling, doesn't mean they shouldn't do it for a younger one.   If a parent has 2 kids, 7 years apart.  Just because they couldn't, say, afford to buy the oldest one a car, that to me doesn't mean that they shouldn't buy the younger one a car when they are of age.  \n\nToo many people on this sub are too obsesses with \"everything has to be exactly equal\"", "There\u2019s a lot of distance and pitstops stops between exactly equal and pretty fucking unfair.  The fact remains that they are treating the kids vastly differently.  They are doing for one what they refused to do for the other.  This is going to have a whole lot of consequences.\n\nI\u2019ll give one example I saw in dh\u2019s family.  Small family farm, parents have mortgaged and remortgaged to the hilt.  Kids just found out and they have always been told they will inherit this farm equally.  Well, parents are elderly, in declining health, and farm is gonna need to be sold to settle debts.  Their solution, proposed by sibling, is they sell to sib and they get to stay on their farm until they die.  Other kid\u2014-who is actually the kid who has been around and done alllllll the fucking work over the years, while sib has literally lived across the country all of their adult life, will get nothing.  Sib says farm will remain in family and all are free to use it after parents pass away.  Uh huh,  yeah.  That\u2019s never going to happen.  There is so much animosity now.  Local kid\u2014who thought they had a good relationship with parent, is so incredibly angry that they have noped the fuck out.  They no longer help with anything.  No more making or driving to drs appointments, no more filling prescriptions or reminders to take meds, no more taking them to social events, no more working on the farm\u2014no more nothing.  Told parents sib could come home and do it.  Kid has peaced out on parents and sib, and has told their kids how it\u2019s gone down, so grandkids have picked their parents side.  So, hope it was worth it for parents and sib.  I would rather die in debt and have my estate have to be liquidated and each of my kids get the same paltry amount or even both get nothing, rather than to give it all to one.  Parents are wringing their hands and crying crocodile tears and saying they can\u2019t understand why local kid is upset.  Idiots.", "I mean, I'm not denying that things can get extremely unfair. \n\nPersonally, I just don't see it that way in THIS situation.  I'm saying this as someone who has gone through something like this.  My mom helped me with my college, but said \"if you fail out, I'm not helping anymore\". I graduated college, and she said \"You can stay here rent free for 6 months, and after that you either need to leave or pay rent\".  I found both of those things to be fair. \n\nMy little brother is 10 years younger than me.  He failed out of college twice, and my mom paid for him to try again twice.  He never finished college and has been living at home rent free for 10+ years.  \n\nWas that \"fair\" to me?  No.  Do I resent him or have anger toward my mother about it?  Also no.  She had more money to help him with college than she had to help me, because by the time he went, he was the only one she was still supporting.  She has also made the choice to support him into adult hood.  Why should that bother me?  I'm happy with my life.  If that is how she chooses to spend her money, why should I be upset about that?", "You don\u2019t feel she cares for him more or you less because she will do for him what she won\u2019t for you?", "No, I don't.  \n\nI feel my brother and I are different people and she needed to help him in ways I didn't need to be help.  He also has/had some mental health issues, which I'm sure contributes to this.  She is treating us as individuals with different needs.  \n\nIf I ever needed my mom, I 100% know she will be there for me.  But I also feel that she instilled a sense of motivation and belief in myself that I appreciate.   I know I can get anything done that I want to.  I don't need to go running to mommy for help whenever something doesn't go my way.  But if something ever happened, she will always be there for me.", "NTA. Make sure they know that favoritism means they better expect him to be the one in charge of their old age care unless they already have plans.\n\nWhat's probably going to happen is he'll either fuck it all up because he didn't have to work for any of it amd they're going to come crying to you for help or he'll be doing great but will live so far away he can't help with with anything so they'll come crying to you for help.\n\nGet as far away from that mess as soon as you can.\n\nThey're going to play favorites and they see the consequences of it later.", "NTA.  They\u2019re very clearly showing favouritism and sexism.  If you were a boy, I bet you would have been offered the same opportunity.", "NTA. And this is a red alert to plan lowering or cutting contact. What a blatant display of favoritism!!!!!", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to be upset. However I wonder if this is less about favoring your sibling over you and more about favoring the type of education. Your parents may see an Ivy League school as a better investment than studying abroad, and it sounds like they think that your brother will be able to repay them solely because \"Ivy League degree=big money.\" Ivy League schools may have been an exception to their rule that they didn't consider until one of their children applied to one. \n\nAgain, this doesn't make it okay, but I know people who will only pay money towards things they see as good investments.", "I have to put a couple of points here first:\n\n- 1st you could have studied oversea with your scholarship, so if you wanted to, why didn't you take it? So you threw this away yourself, not your parents.\n\n- 2nd your brother is getting a loan and has to pay the difference back, which your parents probably only agreed on because you're already settled and don't need anymore help.\n\n- 3rd I understand you're upset they changed the rules after you already decided on a path and the sentence that your brother doesn't need to worry sounds a bit like favouritism. \n\nI go with NAH because your parents don't just gift your brother the money, he has to pay it back and you yourself decided against the oversea scholarship (not your parents fault, you turned it down so live with your decisions). It's still understandable you feel unhappy that your parents changed the rules for your brother.", "ultimately parents should provide the same for all their children, but there could be many facts in play here that are not addressed. id say NTA but why not just say your piece and move on, sounds like you will do fine on your own.", "NTA\nGo LC with them, they have shown you that they do not value you.", "Nta. Sounds like massive favoritism on their part.", "NTA They're using the money they saved by you going local and getting a scholarship to fund your brother's big dreams. Sounds like favoritism to me, and maybe sexism.", "I went through the same thing with my two brothers and favoritism for males.  I would think that would change and evolve but, nope, men/boys are still preferred.  I'm sorry.  I succeed in spite of this but it still hurts.", "NTA. You are 100% correct. Your parents are wrong af for all of this.", "NAH. \n\nGoing abroad to study involves a LOT of factors. The reason I say NAH is because: \n\nYour situation and your brother's situation are not identical. You were told you needed scholarships to study anywhere that was not local. This could be for several reasons including: \n\n1. You planed to study law. Law is something that requires multiple years of study beyond an undergraduate degree.\n2. Laws are different in different parts of the world. Going abroad to study Law does not guarantee you employment in your home country-especially if the legal system is quite different. \n3. Economics/Business is something that requires a bachelor's degree. It does not REQUIRE multiple years of study. \n4. Many economics/business applications are global, and success relies more on connections and networking than knowledge of discrete legal practices that are jurisdictionally important. \n\nAs a result, your parents evaluated the situation between you two and decided that there were significant differences between your career choices and life objectives. Logically they suppose that the business connections made by attending an Ivy League school abroad would yield greater long-term financial returns for someone studying economics than for someone studying law. That is why they have agreed to supply him with the funds for the difference between the funds-that they set aside for local education-to be paid back at a later date. \n\nINFO: Would you have gotten into an Ivy League School? Would you have agreed to change your major to something more (potentially) immediately lucrative upon completion of your undergraduate degree? Would studying Law at a university abroad at a second or third tier university provided you with the legal foundation required to be successful in that field in your home country without spending several years working in government services or without additional study? Will you have access to the principal of your college fund to complete an advanced degree in law at a later date? Did your brother suddenly decide on a different career of study that made the prospect of an Ivy Leage school look like a more attractive as an investment for your parents? Will he have to pay back the loan with interest?\n\nFor these questions, and all these reasons I say there are NAH because there are just too many factors that could be part of the decision-making process on the part of your parents. While favoritism could be an underlying cause this initial post does not automatically lead me to believe it is favoritism. Differences that arise in opportunities sometimes produce differences in outcomes. Consider the hard questions as well as the easy and obvious ones.", "NTA\n\nLet's hope the parents actually get the son to sign a loan agreement, because I don't think they will get any money out of the son.", "NTA.  It is favoritism.  With that said, you are not entitled to their money, but you can freely call out the hypocrisy.  I agree with another commenter about letting them know up front that your brother is the one they need to rely on later since he was given a better opportunity than you and is more in debt to them.", "NTA. And him saying that you should be happy for your brother is just rubbing salt in the wound.", "My parents always made it clear that college was on my tab since I was the one going.  They did end up helping by giving me $1000 per year (their tax deduction for me).  THere were 5 kids still at home when I left for college.  I paid the rest for 4 years at a private college.   By the time I graduated, circumstances had changed and they were able to assist my younger siblings who wanted to go to college.  That was because there were less people to support at home.  Expenses for one or two kids are a lot less than 5 or 6 kids.  Things change.  Is the poster done with college?  If so, her parents now have more disposable to assist the younger brother.  They probably also make more money than when you started college.  Things change that are not in your control and are frankly, none of your business.  Your parents financial arrangements with your brother should be between him and them.  They should not involve you.", "NTA... It should absolutely be same rule for all the children. Either they pay for both of you or none at all.", "NTA. Favortism sucks!", "NTA! You stuck to the rules when you had some big opportunities, then your parents changed the rules to provide more & better opportunities for your brother.  While I would encourage you to be happy for your brother, your parents clearly showed favoritism and most people would be resentful under the circumstances.", "This could mostly be about the Ivy League school. Some parents will bend over backward to be able to say that their child is enrolled at one of those colleges.\n\nWhen I was first going to college, my mom told me that she'd help me get my bachelor's degree but I'd be on my own for my master's. After a while, she got it into her head that I might be able to go to Harvard. She kept talking about it. When I wouldn't bite, she offered to pay for me to go there.", "Why are families always being torn because of money in this sub ??\n\nOkay your parents who raised you didnt offer to pay for you to study abroad.\n\nBut you got a scholarship right ? \n\nDoes your brother has a scholarship to his chosen school ? \n\nPeople are ready to tell you to go NC with your parents who provided for you with a college fund! \n\nI dont know how many parents do that for their kids. \n\nMine are always asking to borrow money from me.\n\nGive them a chance to explain.\n\nPlus your brother has to pay them back. Its a loan.\n\nNAH.", "Hmm, I'm going to go against the grain and actually say \"ESH.\"\n\nAnd I need people to stay with me the entire way before lashing out. I don't know what OP's grades were like, what her prospects were for colleges. She mentions these bonds and such, but that sounds like she got very specific offers that didn't work with her personal plans, and that IS FINE, but if she acquired many scholarships and was financially set between her parents input and the scholarships... would she not have had more and better opportunities?\n\nAnd what of the brother? If he's seriously considering ivy leagues, it must mean he has good grades and been working hard at other extracurriculars to get there. From a surface level explanation, it seems he's at least busted his ass to get into a tier of education that many people can only dream of. Again, not really sure what the OP's situation is.\n\nWhich makes me think the parents are now faced with the prospect of their younger child making it into literally the most prestigious and advantageous academic institutions in the *world* let alone the country, they may want to rethink their policy. And it absolutely does suck for OP, because she has to figure out the financials and all for a lower tier of education.\n\nBut when you *really* zoom in, you don't know if your kid at 5 years old is going to make it to ivy league. I mean you want to provide the best opportunities you can, but also being pragmatic is totally fair. So maybe you tell a 12 year old or a 15 year old that you can only commit so much money to both of the kids. But are you really going to fault someone for trying to make sure their other kid who maybe has the academics, the extracurriculars, the intelligence, and so on to make it to the ivies?\n\nAgain, I'm operating under the little info we have but I can't really say the parents are entirely wrong for this. If that kid has a shot to make it big and has the grades/activities to back it up, he deserves to shoot for the moon. Sister needs to realize that she can have a great life and education where she is, but that resentment is going to bleed into her relationship with the brother and sour it when he's just trying to go as far as he can. I'm saying she isn't entirely wrong, but if I were one of the parents, I'd reconsider it to make sure the kid with Ivy chances can make that a reality.", "I wonder if the parents would've done the same for OP if they applied for one of the schools you mentioned.\n\nParents def playing favorites, but I kinda get it even if it's unfair. I went to local state school for undergrad. Arguably, I did really well: published, internships, etc and it was an absolute bitch finding a job. I'm in grad school now at one of these schools and I'd say my performance has been very mediocre. Looking for jobs before I graduate and omg, the doors that open based on the school name alone.\n\nThey were trying to teach financial responsibility with their conditions before, but these schools really set you up in a way that most dont, so I can see why they'd suddenly be willing to front the money. At least it's a loan and not a gift. Sorry OP", "You mean her brother can.", "She got scholarships everywhere she applied. She is not the wastrel child you seem to be painting her as. She turned down opportunities based on what was available. But now their son has opportunities, more is magically available.\n\nThis is how gender inequality plays out for people's whole lives. Women are underestimated, men are overestimated, in this case by you. (Eg: your assumption that she deserved this inequality despite what the post said) Men are given more opportunities, women fewer (Eg: her parents' unequal treatment) And if she earns less than her brother as a result, they'll go \"We backed the right child!\"", "Also things change and I guess they only offered him the deal because OP is already doing great not needing the zero interest loan at the minute.\n\nAnd her parents have zero fault in her turning down the oversea scholarships she could have taken.", "I think the reason is rooted for the presence or absence of a pen is.\n\nThe OP should be thrilled at her brother's opportunities.... what?\n\nOP is NTA", "No she will, they will expect it as golden boy will have  all these convenient excuses as to why he can't .", "Right, but that's when she laughs in their faces and tells them they have to get a scholarship.", "I mean, I feel like if people want to be estranged from their parents because there were different circumstances around the kids, that is on them.  It seems pretty ridiculous as an adult to get mad that since your parents could afford something for your brother that they couldn't afford for you, that they retroactively owe you something.  \n\nBut you know, people have their own family dynamics, so I guess they can handle it as they like.  \n\nFor me, i know my mom did the best she could under the circumstances for me.  Then 10 years later, her circumstances were different with my little brother, and she did the best she could for him.  I'm not going to be mad about that."]}
