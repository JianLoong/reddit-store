They are willing to HELP him, with the agreement he pays it back.  This has nothing do do with you.\n\nAlso, I'd argue their financial situation has changed.  When you were applying to colleges, they were supporting 2 teenagers at home.   Now that you are in college, and getting it paid for, they are only supporting one.  So all the food, clothes, etc. that they were paying for while you were at home, has been freed up now.  This isn't uncommon.

And they know that he needs more help along the way.   \n\nShouldn't the desired end result that you and your brother are both successful adults?  If he gets a no interest loan from your parents to achieve that, and you got scholarships, does it really matter?  Especially because you'll leave college with no loans, and he'll have to be paying them back.  Isn't that you coming out ahead in the end?\n\nI've experienced something like this.  After I graduated college, my mom told me I had 6 months to get out or start paying rent.  I got out.  It was a bit of a kick that I needed to leave the nest.  My little brother, has been living there rent free for 10+ years.  I once brought it up to her and she said \"I knew by giving you that deadline, you'd be fine.  If I kick him out, I don't have the same faith that he will be\".   Is that \"fair\" to me?  No.  Do I get it?  Absolutely.", "That just doesn't happen sometimes.  For many reasons.  But there are many oldest kids who can tell stories of things they didn't get, but then their younger siblings got it when they were that age.  Different kids have different needs.", "BINGO, or he just doesn\u2019t or \u201ccan\u2019t afford to\u201d", "And that is how you end up estranged from your kids.  When it could have been equal yet you provide one kid with spam and the other with wagyu.  That is the perfect formula for resentment and estrangement.  It also practically guarantees your kids have no relationship with each other when you\u2019re gone.  \n\nI get that things can\u2019t always be exactly equal.  Sometimes financial circumstances are that different\u2014ex: the family used to have money but now we don\u2019t.  But if one child has had dramatically different while another is now getting \u2018better\u2019, then it needs to be equalized in some way\u2014meaning $$ available for something for the kid who didn\u2019t get.  Assuming the kid don\u2019t earn scholarships, I wouldn\u2019t have an oldest kid with hella school loans, but pay for the younger to attend with no loans.  Id pay as much as I could for younger while also paying a chunk on the older\u2019s student loans, and youngest would have to take out remainder in loans.  Both kids would get help and both kids would have loans.  Neither would get all of their education paid for all by me if I couldn\u2019t contribute to both in an almost equal way.", "I don't think she wants a loan though. \n\nLook, the fact is, just because a parent couldn't do something for an older sibling, doesn't mean they shouldn't do it for a younger one.   If a parent has 2 kids, 7 years apart.  Just because they couldn't, say, afford to buy the oldest one a car, that to me doesn't mean that they shouldn't buy the younger one a car when they are of age.  \n\nToo many people on this sub are too obsesses with \"everything has to be exactly equal\"", "There\u2019s a lot of distance and pitstops stops between exactly equal and pretty fucking unfair.  The fact remains that they are treating the kids vastly differently.  They are doing for one what they refused to do for the other.  This is going to have a whole lot of consequences.\n\nI\u2019ll give one example I saw in dh\u2019s family.  Small family farm, parents have mortgaged and remortgaged to the hilt.  Kids just found out and they have always been told they will inherit this farm equally.  Well, parents are elderly, in declining health, and farm is gonna need to be sold to settle debts.  Their solution, proposed by sibling, is they sell to sib and they get to stay on their farm until they die.  Other kid\u2014-who is actually the kid who has been around and done alllllll the fucking work over the years, while sib has literally lived across the country all of their adult life, will get nothing.  Sib says farm will remain in family and all are free to use it after parents pass away.  Uh huh,  yeah.  That\u2019s never going to happen.  There is so much animosity now.  Local kid\u2014who thought they had a good relationship with parent, is so incredibly angry that they have noped the fuck out.  They no longer help with anything.  No more making or driving to drs appointments, no more filling prescriptions or reminders to take meds, no more taking them to social events, no more working on the farm\u2014no more nothing.  Told parents sib could come home and do it.  Kid has peaced out on parents and sib, and has told their kids how it\u2019s gone down, so grandkids have picked their parents side.  So, hope it was worth it for parents and sib.  I would rather die in debt and have my estate have to be liquidated and each of my kids get the same paltry amount or even both get nothing, rather than to give it all to one.  Parents are wringing their hands and crying crocodile tears and saying they can\u2019t understand why local kid is upset.  Idiots.", "I mean, I'm not denying that things can get extremely unfair. \n\nPersonally, I just don't see it that way in THIS situation.  I'm saying this as someone who has gone through something like this.  My mom helped me with my college, but said \"if you fail out, I'm not helping anymore\". I graduated college, and she said \"You can stay here rent free for 6 months, and after that you either need to leave or pay rent\".  I found both of those things to be fair. \n\nMy little brother is 10 years younger than me.  He failed out of college twice, and my mom paid for him to try again twice.  He never finished college and has been living at home rent free for 10+ years.  \n\nWas that \"fair\" to me?  No.  Do I resent him or have anger toward my mother about it?  Also no.  She had more money to help him with college than she had to help me, because by the time he went, he was the only one she was still supporting.  She has also made the choice to support him into adult hood.  Why should that bother me?  I'm happy with my life.  If that is how she chooses to spend her money, why should I be upset about that?", "You don\u2019t feel she cares for him more or you less because she will do for him what she won\u2019t for you?", "No, I don't.  \n\nI feel my brother and I are different people and she needed to help him in ways I didn't need to be help.  He also has/had some mental health issues, which I'm sure contributes to this.  She is treating us as individuals with different needs.  \n\nIf I ever needed my mom, I 100% know she will be there for me.  But I also feel that she instilled a sense of motivation and belief in myself that I appreciate.   I know I can get anything done that I want to.  I don't need to go running to mommy for help whenever something doesn't go my way.  But if something ever happened, she will always be there for me.", "NTA.

However I wonder if this is less about favoring your sibling over you and more about favoring the type of education. Your parents may see an Ivy League school as a better investment than studying abroad, and it sounds like they think that your brother will be able to repay them solely because \"Ivy League degree=big money.\" Ivy League schools may have been an exception to their rule that they didn't consider until one of their children applied to one. \n\nAgain, this doesn't make it okay, but I know people who will only pay money towards things they see as good investments.", "I have to put a couple of points here first:\n\n- 1st you could have studied oversea with your scholarship, so if you wanted to, why didn't you take it? So you threw this away yourself, not your parents.\n\n- 2nd your brother is getting a loan and has to pay the difference back, which your parents probably only agreed on because you're already settled and don't need anymore help.\n\n- 3rd I understand you're upset they changed the rules after you already decided on a path and the sentence that your brother doesn't need to worry sounds a bit like favouritism. \n\nI go with NAH because your parents don't just gift your brother the money, he has to pay it back and you yourself decided against the oversea scholarship (not your parents fault, you turned it down so live with your decisions). It's still understandable you feel unhappy that your parents changed the rules for your brother.", "ultimately parents should provide the same for all their children, but there could be many facts in play here that are not addressed. id say NTA but why not just say your piece and move on, sounds like you will do fine on your own.", "NTA\nGo LC with them, they have shown you that they do not value you.", "Nta.

I would think that would change and evolve but, nope, men/boys are still preferred.  I'm sorry.  I succeed in spite of this but it still hurts.", "NTA. You are 100% correct. Your parents are wrong af for all of this.", "NAH. \n\nGoing abroad to study involves a LOT of factors. The reason I say NAH is because: \n\nYour situation and your brother's situation are not identical. You were told you needed scholarships to study anywhere that was not local. This could be for several reasons including: \n\n1. You planed to study law. Law is something that requires multiple years of study beyond an undergraduate degree.\n2. Laws are different in different parts of the world. Going abroad to study Law does not guarantee you employment in your home country-especially if the legal system is quite different. \n3. Economics/Business is something that requires a bachelor's degree. It does not REQUIRE multiple years of study. \n4. Many economics/business applications are global, and success relies more on connections and networking than knowledge of discrete legal practices that are jurisdictionally important. \n\nAs a result, your parents evaluated the situation between you two and decided that there were significant differences between your career choices and life objectives. Logically they suppose that the business connections made by attending an Ivy League school abroad would yield greater long-term financial returns for someone studying economics than for someone studying law. That is why they have agreed to supply him with the funds for the difference between the funds-that they set aside for local education-to be paid back at a later date. \n\nINFO: Would you have gotten into an Ivy League School? Would you have agreed to change your major to something more (potentially) immediately lucrative upon completion of your undergraduate degree? Would studying Law at a university abroad at a second or third tier university provided you with the legal foundation required to be successful in that field in your home country without spending several years working in government services or without additional study? Will you have access to the principal of your college fund to complete an advanced degree in law at a later date? Did your brother suddenly decide on a different career of study that made the prospect of an Ivy Leage school look like a more attractive as an investment for your parents? Will he have to pay back the loan with interest?\n\nFor these questions, and all these reasons I say there are NAH because there are just too many factors that could be part of the decision-making process on the part of your parents. While favoritism could be an underlying cause this initial post does not automatically lead me to believe it is favoritism. Differences that arise in opportunities sometimes produce differences in outcomes. Consider the hard questions as well as the easy and obvious ones.", "NTA\n\nLet's hope the parents actually get the son to sign a loan agreement, because I don't think they will get any money out of the son.", "NTA.  It is favoritism.  With that said, you are not entitled to their money, but you can freely call out the hypocrisy.

And him saying that you should be happy for your brother is just rubbing salt in the wound.", "My parents always made it clear that college was on my tab since I was the one going.  They did end up helping by giving me $1000 per year (their tax deduction for me).  THere were 5 kids still at home when I left for college.  I paid the rest for 4 years at a private college.   By the time I graduated, circumstances had changed and they were able to assist my younger siblings who wanted to go to college.  That was because there were less people to support at home.  Expenses for one or two kids are a lot less than 5 or 6 kids.  Things change.  Is the poster done with college?  If so, her parents now have more disposable to assist the younger brother.  They probably also make more money than when you started college.  Things change that are not in your control and are frankly, none of your business.

Its a loan.\n\nNAH.", "Hmm, I'm going to go against the grain and actually say \"ESH.\"\n\nAnd I need people to stay with me the entire way before lashing out. I don't know what OP's grades were like, what her prospects were for colleges. She mentions these bonds and such, but that sounds like she got very specific offers that didn't work with her personal plans, and that IS FINE, but if she acquired many scholarships and was financially set between her parents input and the scholarships... would she not have had more and better opportunities?\n\nAnd what of the brother? If he's seriously considering ivy leagues, it must mean he has good grades and been working hard at other extracurriculars to get there. From a surface level explanation, it seems he's at least busted his ass to get into a tier of education that many people can only dream of. Again, not really sure what the OP's situation is.\n\nWhich makes me think the parents are now faced with the prospect of their younger child making it into literally the most prestigious and advantageous academic institutions in the *world* let alone the country, they may want to rethink their policy. And it absolutely does suck for OP, because she has to figure out the financials and all for a lower tier of education.\n\nBut when you *really* zoom in, you don't know if your kid at 5 years old is going to make it to ivy league. I mean you want to provide the best opportunities you can, but also being pragmatic is totally fair. So maybe you tell a 12 year old or a 15 year old that you can only commit so much money to both of the kids. But are you really going to fault someone for trying to make sure their other kid who maybe has the academics, the extracurriculars, the intelligence, and so on to make it to the ivies?\n\nAgain, I'm operating under the little info we have but I can't really say the parents are entirely wrong for this. If that kid has a shot to make it big and has the grades/activities to back it up, he deserves to shoot for the moon. Sister needs to realize that she can have a great life and education where she is, but that resentment is going to bleed into her relationship with the brother and sour it when he's just trying to go as far as he can. I'm saying she isn't entirely wrong, but if I were one of the parents, I'd reconsider it to make sure the kid with Ivy chances can make that a reality.", "I wonder if the parents would've done the same for OP if they applied for one of the schools you mentioned.\n\nParents def playing favorites, but I kinda get it even if it's unfair. I went to local state school for undergrad. Arguably, I did really well: published, internships, etc and it was an absolute bitch finding a job. I'm in grad school now at one of these schools and I'd say my performance has been very mediocre. Looking for jobs before I graduate and omg, the doors that open based on the school name alone.\n\nThey were trying to teach financial responsibility with their conditions before, but these schools really set you up in a way that most dont, so I can see why they'd suddenly be willing to front the money.

Women are underestimated, men are overestimated, in this case by you.

It seems to be that in your father's mind, they are in fact less important.  When they need something, send them to your brother.  Keep in mind, your parents treated you this way and very likely will also treat your future children as substandard as well and will show preferential treatment to your brother's future children.  Set your boundaries and expectations now.", "It feels like favoritism, I agree, but you are NTA. You can't let it eat you up either. As long as you let them know how you feel, there's nothing else you can do if you want to continue to be part of a family. And if you express how you feel, you hopefully won't harbor resentment. Good luck.", "INFO: how tf does his schooling cost 500k ?? That\u2019s like twice most POST-GRAD degrees let alone a undergraduate one\u2026", "Shes sound bitchy, and spoiled, entitled, whatever, I am fairly wealthy and if she was my daughter, I would not give her jack. It not your money, and life isn't fair, get used to it.", "We know you are NOT the golden child and that your dad sandbagged the F out of you. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s their money and they can definitely do what they want with it, but they also aren\u2019t exempt from the ramifications of their decision. So if I were you, if you haven\u2019t already I would separate your life from theirs as much as you can and start living as a fully independent adult, essentially ensuring you are no longer reliant on them or required to engage with in their input in your life. Then, try not to let this affect too much of your day to day relationship with them, but also use this information your parents have given you to weigh out any decisions you make in the future should they require any kind of assistance. Because that dip into the retirement fund is going to come back to haunt them. And you need to make it clear that that is never going to be your problem.", "NTA, you can always point out hypocrisy and lies, but don't expect equal treatment.    \n\n\nNothing is ever truly equal. If you had gotten into Ivy League, it sounds like they'd have paid for it. Whatever their overseas stipulation is/was, well, it doesn't matter. Just do what you feel like doing, even if it is travel and make it work.", "YTA for feeling entitled to your parents\u2019 money.", "The six year bond makes me think this is Singapore, so going overseas can be really different from staying locally.", "Some parents do seem to place a great deal on what their daughter/son is doing.  My parents paid my brother's way through four years of college.  He managed to get an AS degree, a 2 year degree, after three years.  He finally failed all his classes and had to leave school. He found a job that required nothing more than a high school diploma.\n\nI paid my own way through four years of college via a scholarship, work, and loans.  Mother demanded that I borrow more money to join a sorority so she could brag about it to her friends.  Like you, I refused.  Money for education, yes.  Money for mother's ego, no.", "This is the best answer. OP is acting like her and her brothers situations are identical and therefore should be treated as identical by her parents. It's not that simple.", "Why is it I have to sort comments by controversial to find an answer that actually makes sense! Lol", "The money is untouched and who knows if her parents plan to use it to pay for the brothers education. The OP didn\u2019t include any info on who controls the account. There could easily be an update later on about how all the money is gone.", "You aren't entitled to their money.\n\nYou ARE entitled to be upset about blatant favoritism.\n\nHave they explained why?\n\n>my parents have made it point to tell us repeatedly how they don't practice favouritism and have always treated us equally\n\nWhy the sudden change now? Like $500k is not a small amount of favoritism. Thats lifechanging money for almost anyone.", "One child to stay local and take care of aging parents and  one can move away to Ivy league.", "Sometimes the parents are careful about overspending on the oldest for fear of not having enough left for the younger ones. Other times, the parents just have more money later on, because they\u2019re further along in their careers. Sometimes both of those things are in play. And it doesn\u2019t always work out that way. My older sister got a full ride from my parents through college and law school. I got undergraduate paid for completely, but dad\u2019s business wasn\u2019t doing as well by the time I went to law school, and they were only able to pay about one-third of my law school. I resent my parents for some things, but that\u2019s not one of them. That\u2019s just the way it went.", "Fair enough.\n\nThough if it's a government scholarship, they can also put her in any Ministry (Government Department in the US?) - each has a legal section. I know a few people who are lawyers but work for the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport. Those would have been precious connections to make especially if she then joins a law firm.", "I didnt paint her as anything..I don't know op...I offered a few possible scenarios..also parents disposable income may have changed...thats not really the point of my comment though..its that they can't go back in time and give op the same options..but who is to say they wherent going to make it even in some other way.  Seems like bringing it to a actual fight is AH...maybe not..maybe her parents brought it to that point and not op...I dont know.", "I felt dumb when I realized that the term \u201cbond\u201d was being used in the sense of bond-age/indentured servitude, a contract that you need to work off.", "Yeah, but in her post she stated she didn't want to be tied down in her 20s when she could be \"exploring opportunities\" meaning at the time she had no concrete plans.\nShe also turned down a scholarship to study overseas. Did she discuss this decision with her parents? Did she ask if she could borrow money off them? \nOP is just jealous and entitled. They're not actually giving her brother anything they didn't give her (she chose not to use her collage fund). All they are doing is offering a no interest loan", "I think it\u2019s unfair that they didn\u2019t even make him go through the same process of doing the work applying for schools and scholarships and narrowing down his choices before offering a way to make the most expensive option possible.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge amount of personal responsibility and work that she was forced to take on that he has an option to bypass.", "OP mentions in a comment that she is a lawyer."]}
