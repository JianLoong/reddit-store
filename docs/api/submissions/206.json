I\u2019ve never liked my brother nor had a good relationship with my brother.  My brother was fortunate enough to get the college experience meanwhile I had to do online. I was in my first year when my brother came back home to live with me and our parents. Apparently my brother had been slacking according to his teachers and not focusing on his studies. My brother asked if he could have my room in the house and I told him no and to rent a place. He claimed he had no money, he asked to share and I told him that I want my own room and he can sleep on the couch. He slept on the couch for a few months before finally getting a condo. I don\u2019t know if it was the best thing to do but my brother shouldn\u2019t just expect me to give him my room. My parents intervened and I told them he can sleep on the floor. I now regret doing this I feel like I took it too far. Am I the a-hole? I was just worried he would take advantage of me(as he does that a lot).

After living with abuse for so long I don\u2019t know who in my family to trust anymore.", "So the house only had 2 rooms? Who had which room before he kept for college?", "No. Dude. I would have said the same thing. He probably would have made you sleep on the couch or floor if you had let him share your room.  Your brother getting a condo was probably the nest thing for everyone. Cheer up dude. I hope you land a really great job that pays you well so you can move out.", "This might be better suited for some sort of relationship subreddit.  If your parents didn\u2019t think you should have to give up your room than you probably shouldn\u2019t have felt obligated to do so.  He\u2019s not an asshole just for asking though, but as you didn\u2019t specify how he reacted to your saying no to judge if he was TA after the fact.  So, yeah\u2026either NTA or NAH.", "What were you being asked to do, exactly? Share with him? Turn over the room to him completely and move out to the couch yourself? If you were supposed to be sharing, in what way? Move a cot in, get a second bed, put him on an air mattress, put you on an air mattress? \n\nAlso, where in the house did he live before he moved out to go to college in the first place?", "It was meant to be his room but no one expected him to come back. I wasn\u2019t about to give my room up. Yes the house only had two rooms. It is strange, my parents weren\u2019t that great people.", "It was a really long time ago.", "Well if it was a long time ago. Why bring it up here? Is your brother using it to make you feel bad or something?", "It\u2019s a complicated situation. I think I never can let it go because of my family specifically. Maybe I worded this wrong or should add more info.", "Yeah kinda. It sounds like your in college still living at home. But after chatting with you. It sounds like you've moved and graduated. I mean what inspired you to make a post?", "If it was a long time ago you can now look at it with hindsight: would your brother have moved into a Cando after a few months if he was comfortable in your room? Would you have been able to pursue your studies in the same way if he was in your room? Did your brother treat you as badly as before after he moved out?....\n\nIf you can say now that the decision to have him out of your space saved you peace and your studies then everything is okay. The experience of having your brother over could have been very stressful and you avoided that.", "I'm sorry but you seem to be an unreliable narrator. People have asked for specifics like do you mean share a room or that he gets it completely etc but you don't answer. You keep  saying they are abusive but give no examples. The only thing you say is they bring up stuff you did in the past but that wouldn't be an issue if you hadn't done bad things in the past. \n\nUntil people get more info I don't think anyone can vote", "Abuse from my family. I constantly am being thrown under the bus with things\nI did in the past for some reason. I have moved but not graduated. Not that long ago to be honest but I feel like a bad person so I made this post to get me back to reality.", "You're not a bad person. Think of it this way. If you let him share your room he would have never moved out. Do you still talk to your family?"]}
