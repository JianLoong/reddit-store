Giving everyone else gifts but you is pretty cruel. Have you ever brought this up to him before?\n\nNTA by the way. Sounds like you two need marriage counseling. There's something seriously wrong here.", "NTA\n\nI don't agree with giving him the silent treatment but it absolutely astounds me that he buys his mother and grandmother gifts and gets nothing for you. If you have a good relationship with your FIL, I'd ask him if he taught his son that was the right way to treat his wife. Also, his next day off, he should take care of the baby all day - might teach him something about appreciation.", "NTA.\n\nI am happily divorced now, but I used to have one like that. After a few years of frustration I just bought my own presents and gifted them to myself. \n\nMothersday was important to me when motherhood worked its way in every choice I made. From my places of work (close enough, flexible enough for the kids, not demanding overtime, etc.) to how I spend every moment of my life. But now they don't need that anymore and I get to base choices on personal preferences again - and Mothersday became less important too.\n\nAnyway, as it turns out, getting your own presents is only a few years distance from divorce. It is a strong symbol of making your own life fun - and in the end, that turned out to be so much easier without the dead weight and the unfulfilled expectations.", "NTA.   \nThis worries me though. He acknowledges his mother and grandmother on Mother's day but not you, the fluffing mother of his child nonetheless.  \n\n\nHe needs a wake up call. How is your relationship with his mother and grandmother? Maybe talk to them about it, openly. Or make a passive aggressive remark like 'Oh MIL and GMIL, I love the presents my SO gave you. I would've loved to have gotten anything ! \\*sigh\\*.  \nHave a talk with him but do something.  \nYou deserve to be acknowlegded.", "if you are ok with not talking to him, then you should be ok with moving his ass out.\n\nor moving you and your daughter out.\n\n***he is probably going to LOVE that you are quiet and not fussing at him.***\n\nYOU need to make a fuss, be loud and obnoxious about it. make sure he knows why your pissed. \n\nYou rolling over and taking it isn't going to make you happy.\n\nStand up for yourself. The old adage is \"IF MAMMA AIN'T HAPPY, AIN'T NOBODY HAPPY\"\n\nhis ass wouldn't get to nap, sleep, rest peacefully, watch another tv show, even go to the bathroom to shit, without me fussing.", "NTA, but silent treatment is a bit petty and won\u2019t achieve anything. You have bigger issues here. Your husband says Mother\u2019s Day isn\u2019t as important as Christmas and birthdays, but doesn\u2019t get you anything for those either? But does feel the need to some appreciation for his mother and grandma. The guy is an ass, and I\u2019m guessing this lack of respect extends to other areas of your life as well.", "NTA. But realize just because this seems normal from him because it\u2019s the only relationship you\u2019ve had. This Is red flag behavior, he\u2019s treating you like sh**.", "NTA\n\nHe is a jerk, but do not do anything from now on for any of his birthdays or fathers day, not a SINGLE thing. I'm sorry he is being crappy, I hope apart from this you have a good relationship.", "NTA but why on earth are you married to this man? It sounds like he doesn\u2019t give a shit about you.", "It's childish to give someone the silent treatment. TELL HIM he fucked up. Tell him how it makes you feel. Keep telling him until he does something about it! NTA", "NTA. Looks like your husband could use a crash course in \"Mother's Day 101.\"", "NTA. This sounds awful. I\u2019d normally recommend counselling but it just sounds like he doesn\u2019t care about you and isn\u2019t willing to put in any effort.", "Ignoring someone is passive-aggressive.\n\nBeing passive-aggressive is always a dick move.\n\nBut you have a reason, the AH of your husband. He is disrespecting you, and certainly he is not appreciating you and your work and effort. He takes you as granted.\n\nI would better try to make it clear, with words. \"I'm expecting this from you; I won't engage into anything with you until then. Actually, you sleep in the couch until I feel appreciated as a mother and partner. Oh, and I want also presents for my birthday, our anniversaries, Christmas and Valentine's Day.

You are an adult and you are suppose to solve problem talking or acting, So, yta.\n\nAlso usually, for mother's day, children are suppose to give gift to Moms, with the help of the other parents, not your husband.\nIn the end the question Is: why you expect a gift during mother's day, when during Christmas and birthday you never receive gift? Also, why he never give you gift? That's the question and, in fact, the real problem here.", "NTA, not at all, but to be completely honest it sounds like your husband is not okay with you being (I'm assuming) a sahm. I'm not justifying his actions at all, just trying to give some real advice instead of just judgement. You're both still young, If you believe this guy isn't the loser his actions portray him as, you should have a serious talk about reevaluating both of your expectations. Maybe it's not that deep and the dude is just really shitty about special occasions, either way you deserve to feel appreciated.", "Are you the asshole for ignoring your husband for ignoring you after not giving you anything and ignoring you for Mothers Day? \n\nYes. \n\nESH. \n\nBeing passive aggressive solves nothing.\n\nYou are not the asshole for feeling the way you do. \nHe hasn\u2019t gotten you a gift for any holiday. \nYou\u2019ve been together 7 years. \nHe told you he doesn\u2019t care about the holiday for you multiple times. \nHe has *shown* you that he doesn\u2019t care for years. Come on. Take time to reflect.", "You ever give him anything for Father's Day? You are a petty AH. If he takes care of you and his daughter, that is what matters.", "ESH.  You're imposing a change on him, which he clearly isn't interested in, and then you're upset when he doesn't follow through.  You're literally setting yourself up for failure.  You're an asshole to yourself in a sense.\n\nHe's the real asshole though.  You clearly aren't getting what you need out of this marriage with him and he doesn't care.  He sounds like an ungrateful jackass.\n\nYou can do better.  Single and not crying all day is better.", "Happy Mother's Day \ud83d\udc90\n\nBased on info provided YTA for selfishly demanding a gift and giving a silent treatment for your demands not being met. It's selfish because your demand only betters you and not your family.\n\nSounds like you both became parents really young and his view of Mother's Day is that it's a day for the kids to show appreciation to their parents (so if you want a gift look to your daughter). \n\nHelpful Info: What kind of gift were you expecting (a card, jewelry, act of service like cooking a meal, or getting a sitter for a date night)? Is money tight at home? Does your husband work and you stay home? Do you know how a gift would impact your household budget or savings?\n\nIt may benefit your relationship to check out the book The 5 Love Languages.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have advised that minimal expense is needed. You still get him stuff which he would probably kick up a fuss about if you stopped. So this is entirely deliberate at this point. Even if he forgot, he can literally use his phone and order a delivery/collection of something within a few hrs... he just doesn't see the value of it.\n\n He doesn't seem to see the value of making you happy.

He is a grown adult, with a functioning brain. He knows exactly what he is doing, and you communicated very clearly that you wanted some form of acknowledgement from him for Mothers Day. Then he downplayed your role in the marriage, and basically said you were just doing what you were supposed to do- no cause for celebration. Given the gifts he presents to his mum and grandma, that affirms that he DOES comprehend the significance of it- why would he bother otherwise?\n\nThat lack of acknowledgement of Mother's Day was 100% intentional imo. All he needed to do was at least say the words, but he denied you that. \n\nIn summary: knew you wanted acknowledgement, said you didn't deserve it, made a point to withold it. Sheesh...

Also the child is 4, do you expect her to have an innate instinct that these are gift giving holidays at her young as fuck age? Where do you expect her to procure these gifts? A toddler has no money. A toddler has to be reminded to draw pictures or make a craft as a gift. That's a baby. You can't try and pin responsibility for gift giving on an actual literal infant. No, the other parent buys a gift they know their spouse will enjoy and write \"From, Toddler\" on it.", "He gets his mother and grandmother gifts for mothers day. She doesn't get birthday, Christmas, or Valentine's gifts (until the most recent Valentine's day apparently). He tells her mother's day is not important, it's not like those other holidays (he never gets her gifts for). No he's just an asshole.", "where do you expect a four year old to get a gift if not from the other parent. a toddler will not know right off the bat that they need to make something either, they need to be coached and reminded to make something special for mommy. the problem is that he made zero effort to even attempt to get a gift \"from the kid\" since she's a fucking toddler and is literally incapable of driving to walmart and getting something cheap.", "Is this a guy you want to spend the rest of your life with?", "Wow, that's insane. Sounds like he just doesn't care enough to get you anything. Also, you've been together since you were 15? If this is the only relationship you've ever had, and you've had it since you guys were teens, I'm thinking maybe you don't realize things should be better. Healthy relationships don't work like this. Just from your post, it sounds like you two have a lack of proper communication, he doesn't listen to or respect you, and he doesn't even care enough to get you literally anything on any major holiday. Does he ever show you any appreciation at all?\n\nI'm not necessarily saying you should leave, because none of us know what else is going on and no one has the right to tell you to split from your partner. But this relationship is really unhealthy, and it sounds really bad for your own mental health and self esteem. If he's willing, try talking to him about going to counseling together.\n\nThis is what your daughter is going to learn is acceptable behavior from a man. She is going to learn that it's okay for someone to treat her that way in a relationship if things don't change.", "If my husband or I don't know what to get each other we ask: \"what would you like for your Birthday?\" \n\nMine is coming up in June and my husband is well aware that I would like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom even though he probably wouldn't have thought of that himself. He asked me what I wanted.", "These things are the same time each year. He should be planning accordingly. He\u2019s not. Does he love you or just what you do for him , your household & child?", "NTA, but stop doing anything. Don't give him the silent treatment. \nPut in the same effort he puts in gifts for you. It is dissapointing. But better than being heart-broken. So no father's day, birthday, Christmas or any gifts. Put that effort into yourself and your child.\nAnd when he asks, tell him you thought that you weren't doing gifts anymore.", "Definitely NTA - I was wondering if the lack of appreciation in the form of gifts went both ways and was a bit of an unspoken agreement, but this sounds very one sided and absolutely horrible of him! Sounds like you deserve a lot better.", "I called him shitty, a loser, and most importantly the AH, what do you want from me lol? I'm attempting to play armchair asshole psychologist, I found the part about him saying he shouldn't have to kiss her ass for doing her job of being a mother quite telling.", "I expect nothing and neither should she.", "His paycheck never comes around on every other holiday? But it's enough for his mother/grandmother to get gifts on mother's day? And she has gotten nothing for years? While making him special meals and giving him gifts for his holidays? She outright told him she wanted to feel appreciated this once, she's communicating open and clearly. OPs message is received, he doesn't gaf about her."]}
