This is something I\u2019ve always done every year whether it\u2019s with a friend group, family, or S/O, so it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been anticipating for basically an entire year. \n\nThis year I wanted to make it a private trip for me and my boyfriend who we\u2019ll call Brad. I\u2019ve already booked and paid for the hotel and a few of the activities we\u2019ll be doing, which I was bringing up to him to see if there\u2019s anything else that he would specifically like to do. I eventually brought up the fact I\u2019d like to go bar hopping and see some live music and/or go walk on the beach at night when Brad said we couldn\u2019t do anything after 9pm since he would be playing video games.\n\nBrad plays Rainbow Six Siege with a group of his college friends on his gaming PC. They play every night in order to practice for some sort of competition/tournament they have coming up. It\u2019s nothing professional esports level or anything, but I know they do take it seriously and I understand and respect that. I play games on my own PC myself so I understand. But seeing as how they need to practice, he says he\u2019s bringing his entire PC setup to the beach with us.\n\nI tried bringing up the fact I was hoping the trip could be more intimate and focused around us doing stuff together since it\u2019s only a 4 day/3 night trip and we wouldn\u2019t be gone that long. Brad is adamant on bringing his PC, and saying that me trying to convince him not to is selfish and he feels like I\u2019m controlling him and how he spends his time. His main argument point is that we have all day to do stuff and he only wants to be on his PC at night. He also said I should bring my PC so we can play games together, but we don\u2019t even play games together while we\u2019re at home since I don\u2019t play R6 and he constantly has a full group anyways. \n\nI\u2019m trying to put my foot down about this and the argument has come to the point where he is saying he won\u2019t come on the trip if he can\u2019t bring it and have his gaming time at night.\n\nAITA for wanting a trip without his PC coming along with us?", "created_utc": 1688089062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mmtby/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_bring_his/", "score": 389, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole vacation would be to get away for a little while, and spend time together, not play video games while you do what? I doesn\u2019t seem your SO is willing to make that sacrifice, and to me that seems selfish.", "NTA. Sometimes putting down technology is the healthiest thing he can do to live in the moment. This is going to be one of those times. Gaming with the boys is fun but you need to make time for your significant other as well.  \n\n\nBe firm on this one, he's being a child.", "He plays EVERY NIGHT? That's really not necessary. I love videogames, don't get me wrong, but I couldn't justify playing them every night after 9 pm. Unless I was a professional and my income depended on it\u2014I'm assuming he isn't.\n\nIt's not even the videogames. There's not a single activity that I would absolutely have to do every night after 9 pm that would take priority over everything else, even activities with my partner on vacation.\n\nIt's super selfish that he is choosing to game every night without fail instead of spending time with you on a vacation that you planned.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's frankly concerning that your boyfriend can't put his game away for a few days to spend time with his girlfriend. Makes it very clear where you land on the priority list.", "You're not his gf, you're the side piece. He loves the computer and his games.\n\nEither make peace with that or make other decisions accordingly. \n\nNTA", "NTA. My husband likes to game as well, but if we are on a trip just the two of us, he wants to spend all his time with me. He may bring a switch to play when we have downtime.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA.  Vacation is a break from life and you are literally paying to break your routine.", "NTA, your bf is a loser", "NTA.  And your BF is nuts.  If I was one of his buddies I\u2019d refuse to let him play.  How does someone like this even have a GF?!?", "NTA\n\nYou just learned an expensive lesson that you come second to a video game.", "NTA. Brad, however, is an absolute AH. \n\nThis is vacation-ruining stuff and it shows he will never prioritise you. Selfish in the extreme. I enjoy video games, but I ensure that it doesn\u2019t interfere with even downtime in the evening (we both work irregular, non-matching hours). The thought of someone cutting off the vacation every night at 9pm is maddening. \n\nCall his bluff, go with a friend instead.", "**NTA**\n\nI had an ex like that.

If you are paying for all of this, or a significant chunk of this, you are definitely NTA for stressing that you have a say in how the two of you spend your time. If you're paying for all or mostly all of this, then his choices are either to go with sans PC you or stay home.You didn't mention this, but I would imagine the PC coming with you also entails that from 9pm onwards, you're in the room with \"ROTATE LEFT!! CONTACT! DRONES UP... OK... SHIT!! FUCK... GO BACK!!!  ...GET REKT!!!\"???\n\nI'm so sympathetic to your situation, because I know you don't want to be on this awesome vacation and Brad is just pouting all the time... nor do you want to feel like you have no say and just give into whatever he wants.\n\n~~Maybe explore a compromise that you both can live with? What if the deal is that the PC comes along, but is only setup for 2 nights... and then the other 2 nights he agrees that the damn thing stays in his luggage?~~  EDIT: I'm giving Brad too much credit. If he knows he could be gaming on the off-nights and is PC is RIGHT FUCKING THERE, he's going to be thinking about it non-stop. Nah, PC needs to stay at home. \n\nAnother tactic -- say the PC doesn't come along with you. Is there a world in which you guys go do a nighttime activity and both leave your phones in the hotel room? I know it's a big ask, but this is the best way to keep him away from his friends pinging him on discord, him checking in on the bois, or otherwise finding sneaky ways to 'work' on his upcomming competition.", "NTA and take him on his offer to not go.  It sucks, you want to spend time with him, but he is showing you he is not actually worth your time.  Start asking your friends now, I don\u2019t think it will be as hard to find a replacement companion for this trip as you think.  Then while you are away you can think about whether or not you want to continue to be second fiddle to video games.", "NTA. It\u2019s a VACATION from everyday life. It\u2019s weird that he isn\u2019t comfortable taking a few days off from his friends", "NTA.... its for 3 nights, there are tons of stuff to do at night for vacation, sometimes the most fun.\n\nInvite someone else. you should have a great time on your vacation, day and night.", "Are you tho king about making babies with this guy?  Cause he won\u2019t change a diaper or make a bottle after 9 PM.  NTA", "Wait, so you've already been planning this vacation with your BF for a few months, and he mentions wanting to bring his gaming PC with him *now*? You'd have figured this would've been one of the very first things to get straight during the planning. I guess not. If the nightly gaming sessions are so important to him, I don't know why the vacation planning was even allowed to hit the *one*-month mark.\n\nAnyway, isn't the whole point of a vacation to take a break from a person's regular routine? To relax and do other things for a bit while having a fun time?\n\nBut also, you mention this is a gaming PC, as in a whole desktop setup with monitors, keyboard, mouse, and other things, right? That would take up a *lot* of room. I would at least give your BF a very slight amount more credit if this were a gaming laptop we were talking about, but I can't fathom bringing an entire PC setup, no way.\n\nNTA", "NTA!!\n\nEdit: I see now you commented they don't play for money.. Then wtf are they practicing for!??? Are they working up to compete someday? Cause there are a ton of small events non professional teams play and actually get rewards and the event is hosted and everything. Your bf is out of touch. \n\n\nyeah I understand having to practice but he was out of line with what he told you. \"and how he spends his time\" well he can spend it at home since his time doesn't involve you not even in gaming since he always has a full lobby anyways.\n\nIt's sad you guys don't play games together as well. Me and my bf met through CSGO and been living together for nearly 3 years now . We met at the end of 2018 and started dating in 2020 and we always play games together and always have. Of course we have our own games we play separately. I play ESO and he loves to play a variety of small games mostly hack and slash.\n\nGirl, you deserve someone who includes you not act like you are in the way. You shouldn't have to make it clear to your partner you want quality time. A relationship comes first.", "NTA. Tell him to take his gaming PC and fuck off. Or, if you want to be super, super petty about it, let me know and I'll tell you how to delete all the files off his computer.", "NTA. If his gaming is so important then leave him at home and find someone else to go on holiday with, or go on your own and have a great time. There is no reason for you to miss out or be second fiddle to a computer game because of Brad\u2019s selfishness", "Yeah NTA, but he definitely is. As previously stated, vacations are for getting away from the absurdity of everyday bs we call life. Have I taken a game console to a hotel with us before? Sure, but it was never unpacked unless it was raining and miserable outside, but that was mostly for sanity's sake and never on a romantic getaway. \n\nI do find the visual in my head rather humorous though. Are you maybe confusing PC with laptop? I honestly can't see someone dragging an entire gaming rig on vacation. Either way, still not cool.", "Girl just end this relationship, good god. You seem like you're interested in living in the real world, making memories, having experiences. He isn't. Find someone who values the same lifestyle as you.", "I honestly don\u2019t think either of you are really assholes, but neither of you are willing to compromise your happiness. A vacation is supposed to be spent doing what you wanna do, not what someone else wants you to do. Is it fair to call it a vacation for him if he isn\u2019t able to do what he enjoys? I don\u2019t think so, but same does go for you as you want more intimate quality time. \n\nSo one thing I also wanted to point out, if he does leave his PC home. Whatever y\u2019all do at night won\u2019t be as nice as you want. He\u2019ll be holding that bit of resentment in and it\u2019ll probably end up being worse, \n\nAt this point, I think you\u2019d be better off going with someone else who would enjoy the things you will, instead of forcing your boyfriend to ditch his happiness to do what you want. Since he clearly has his foot down and so do you, I don\u2019t see any other solution really", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also I would be wary about taking my full setup with me as we\u2019re your staying may cover any damages/theft also if your flying the altitude can cause problem with certain electronics if there pressured think cooling fluid over the motherboard not good at all. Best of luck :)", "The man cannot go three nights without gaming for the sake of having a holiday together with his girlfriend. He is way too immature to be in a relationship and doesn't care all that much about you. It is perfectly reasonable to expect him not to bring his gaming pc on vacation where he is suppose to spending time with you. Literally he doesn't care about you. Time to move on.", "NTA and I wonder if the BF is going to realize that his level of practice is going to be shit on a hotel internet connection. \n\nHotel internet isn't really meant for gaming so he's going to just lag like crazy. A friend of mine will sometimes bring his PS5 with him on trips (especially work trips) and while certain games are playable just fine online it's really not a competitive experience.", "NTA . Your boyfriend is a man child. I don't like giving ultimatums but in this case you are well in your rights to demand this. If he balks you didn't lose much. Find a friend to go with you and have a blast. Hope you find someone who will appreciate you.", "He's telling you something very important and you aren't listening.  Gaming with friends is his top priority-- you and your relationship are somewhere farther down the list.  You are asking for THREE nights out of 365  and he's refusing you that.

Go have a lovely trip by yourself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t keep the boyfriend at all, this is how he\u2019ll behave in the future as well. You are not his priority", "NTA - I'd go by myself if he wants to spend time with his PC more than he wants to be on vacation with me.", "NTA. A gaming pc does not belong on a romantic getaway. \n\nSince everything is fully paid for, can you get a girlfriend to go with you? Then find a different boyfriend before you book another vacation. You are not this jerk's priority. There is no point in throwing away good money on him and having to twiddle your thumbs every night while he plays games.", "NTA\n\nHe has very clearly stated that he would rather game than go on vacation with you. He has literally said so. Believe him. He's telling you his priority list, and you are not on it.\n\nDisinvite him. Find a friend or go solo. Really, really think about why you are with this guy.", "NTA\n\nMy husband i are both gamers. The computers stay home. He's being ridiculous and showing how little he actually cares about you.", "NTA. It's time to uninvite him from the trip and your life.", "NTA, OP, and you know how this is going to turn out. \u201cYou go ahead and do the already planned and paid for activity, I\u2019m gonna stay back and play games\u201d. \u201cSorry babe I\u2019m not feeling up for going to the beach today, I stayed up pretty late last night gaming\u201d.

No chance I would do that.\n\nYour bf on the other hand is manipulative ass. Sorry about that mate, he clearly could use few days off to think about whats important and sort his shit out. Did he at least help to plan it? If he didn't, imagine wedding planning or taking care of kids.", "I play video games and I wouldn't even think to bring a whole gaming PC on a trip. At the very most I would bring a handheld just do to the natural downtime of nighttime and early morning and what not. It seems like boyfriend is going to prioritize gaming and preparing for the competition over enjoying yalls vacation.", "Sounds like an addiction.  He needs help.", "sigh ... NTA. \n\nLike I get it ... it's his holiday too but who wants to be indoors at the beach after 9 PM?!?! I'm sorry, OP. I really have no advice on this. I'm just sorry.", "NTA and I would not pay for him to travel to play games in the hotel.  Unacceptable.  I agree it\u2019s time to ask some friends.", "NTA HE DEFINITELY IS.  DUMP him he cares more about gaming than you.  Take the trip and leave him home.  This guy is Ridiculous", "YTA. Game is life. You knew what you signed up for when you started dating a gamer.", "NTA \n\nLets be honest your BF is a looser. Why he is even with you when even holidays with you are less important than games?", "Something I haven\u2019t seen brought up yet\u2026 what is the time difference in where you\u2019re going vs where you live? Same time zone or hours different? Is he gonna need to wake up in the middle of the night to play at the same time as his buddies or cut out time in the middle of the day or will it still be 9pm where you\u2019re at?\n\nNTA find someone else to take the trip with and seriously reconsider this relationship bc as many have already said if he can\u2019t take a few days off to go on a romantic trip with you, he won\u2019t be the support you need in good and bad times bc he will be more focused on gaming with his buddies instead", "Oh honey, no! NTA. You are not controlling or selfish for wanting a few nights of just you and him time when he plays every other night. He\u2019s prioritising gaming over your relationship and will continue to do so it sounds like. Please find someone else to go with now and tell him either he comes on the trip without his PC or he doesn\u2019t come at all.", "NTA, \n\nWho agrees to go on a holiday and then still expects to be playing games with the guys.\n\nOn them trainiing for tournaments... actually NOT an excuse because the defence here would be \"okay then its work not social\" in which case, who the hell brings their work on holiday, and why is he suggesting you should bring your PC to game with him if he's working.\n\nTheres more to life than both work and gaming, at least he's saying only after 9pm, but seriously!? so no romantic nights out then? hell when me and friends go to restaurants to catch up we've ended up out at 1am .. more times than i can count now...", "nta. i understand him wanting to practice for an upcoming tournament but if he can\u2019t put his video games away for 4 days then he has no business entering this tournament bc clearly he won\u2019t win , if 4 days of practice makes that much of an impact \ud83d\ude44\n\nthis trip is for the two of you to spend time together and connect. break up w him and tell him to date his pc instead", "He could argue the same thing", "Brad is a loser.", " How? For me dating a gamer is a huge no", "This is not the statement of person who puts their foot down .you are already making up excuses on why you are going to let him bring it. Go by yourself. have a grand time. In that period away think about if he is the right guy for you. People take vacations and breaks he can go 5 days without a controller in his hand and if he cant then there is your answer.  IF you do let him don't let him keep you in at night. go out  bar hop and such anyways - Don't let him or any argument deter you.", "also WHY are you paying for the vacation and not splitting the costs???????", "find a new boyfriend", "Right?! \n\nDouble standards. At least it's upfront about it, it's a different thing. If they both want to spend their holidays in different ways, no-ones at fault.", "If you have ti bring your video games on vacation with your girlfriend you've got a problem", "Every night for a year? Then no, this is not vital \"training\".\n\nI'd be slightly more understanding if this was some upcoming tournament they only had a few weeks to prepare for, but if they train every single day and have for the past year, a 3 day vacation would not completely destroy their flow or their chances of winning.\n\nHe's BSing you.", "Like, dont get me wrong, i am not saying he's a loser because of the video games. Me and my wife both have pc's as well. However, if we are to go on a vacation, we aren't bringing them. And i am not gunna give my wife shit because i need to play an old ass game and have a \"tournament\" coming up.", "wow, do you also blame victims of abuse bc their partner abused them? yikes", "Okay, that's fair. Going drinking is my own personal worst nightmare, but if he likes it, that's cool. I do think you're right to look askance at bringing the whole gaming rig and wondering whether your BF could use an intervention on that.", "actually only 3 days cause the last day they'd most likely be home before he normally plays.", "That would make me not want to go. Not everyone likes dancing and partying in bars.", "Nah it would be the same if he was playing/ practicing a sport for an upcoming tournament. I\u2019m not into competitive gaming at all but it\u2019s legit these day.

It's not healthy. It's not healthy to be unable to stop playing for 4 days, that's such a tiny amount of time. \n\nAddictions aren't healthy and need to be dealt with. \n\nWe don't know if OP knew about the extend of his addiction. For all OP knows he could've been able to step away from the computers for a couple days. Nobody in their right might would think of brining their whole computer and their two monitors to game while on a 4 day vacation, that's just ridiculous.", "Meh, yeah everyone likes different things etc etc but if it was my boyfriend then I\u2019d be single already. No way I\u2019d stay with someone who cannot EVER spend time with me in the evenings. Dude is probably going to end up alone, he really is taking OP for granted", "That's kinda sad ngl", "&#x200B;\n\nDon't disagree... Until the point where they've been planning a trip abroad for months... I lose entire weekends to gaming, if i wanted to stay in a hotel and game, why would i bother agreeing to go on holiday in the first place when my internet and home setups are known quantities.", "He doesn't make a career out of it.  I play in football (soccer) competitions regularly, I would be a massive bellend if I met up with my mates for a kick about every night of my holiday with the Mrs.", "I'm a avid video gamer and I thoroughly agree. I play game sway more then J should but I would never go on vacation and think I'm going to game every night instead of hangout with my girlfriend.", "Me personally, yes, I'd agree. You'd never catch me doing some shit like that. \n\nThat being said, that's his life, 'or lack of', he's got every right to it, doesn't make him an asshole. If it doesn't work for her, she should be with someone else.", "You are worth so much more than this!", "Uh, and you assume I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? \nI know plenty of people with severe addictions, I\u2019ve seen my friends die from addictions. I overcame an alcohol and a tobacco addiction, and I do personally indulge in gaming quite a lot nowadays still. I actually had a gaming laptop I brought everywhere and nowadays I game on my phone wherever I go, it\u2019s just part of who I am. Eventually I\u2019ll even get a steam deck so I can play even more games when I\u2019m out, \n\nIt used to be a severe addiction for me,  and while I agree that it isn\u2019t healthy. It is not your choice wether he should or should not do it. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s healthy or not, it doesn\u2019t make him an AH if he chooses to indulge that addiction. Nobody says people are AH\u2019s for being addicted to McDonald\u2019s and it\u2019s not healthy either, yet half the world openly embraces that addiction. So no, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s as big a deal as y\u2019all are making it out to be. \nEspecially if he\u2019s keeping it to a set time and schedule like it sounds, unlike a really BAD addiction where people like me in the past would accumulate unhygienic habits, staying inside for months to years at a time, pissing in bottles and having a microwave in your room so you can always be in the game. That\u2019s when they need outside help, not when they\u2019re controlling it and keeping it to a schedule which shows control,\n\nHe doesn\u2019t sound like he can\u2019t go without it, he sounds like he doesn\u2019t WANT to go without it. And he has the right to feel that way, just as OP has a right to feel upset about it.\n\nYou can\u2019t force someone to quit, my point still stands that this is a problem of conflicting people. Not a problem of whose the AH", "Don't get me wrong, I think it's really bizarre to take your PC on holiday. But she's choosing to be in a relationship with the guy so there has to be some compromise about how they spend their time. So like i said, she should get to choose what they do one night and he should choose another night. \n\nYou don't win arguments in intimate relationships, you just build resentment.", "Why?", "Your boyfriend is a complete AH.  It's supposed to be a vacation.  It's supposed to be about spending time together.  It's very concerning how adamant he is about taking his PC & threatening to not go on the trip at all.  That right there screams addiction.   I'm sorry he is doing this, but other than going on the vacation alone or maybe a friend, there really isn't much you can do.  If this relationship has a future, he needs to stop putting his gaming first.  He is choosing his gaming over spending time with you.  You really need to think about that.", "NTA - there\u2019s hobbies and passions, but this sounds like an addiction. He\u2019s delusional if he thinks this arrangement is acceptable. If he is trying to go pro, I would get the dedication, but his gaming would probably get worse after that.\n\nYou\u2019re fine to want to have even just one night out on your vacation and expecting as much is not controlling or selfish. He\u2019s the one making ultimatum, refusing to budge and controlling your vacation.", "NTA. He's a weirdo.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m a gamer and I also typically only play late at night as I am at work or with my gf during the day/evening. That being said, there is absolutely no reason he cannot go 3 nights without it. I can appreciate wanting to improve/practice leading up to a tournament (or in general) but 3 nights off to step away and enjoy a beach themed vacation is not going to set him back years in his skill set. At worst, he might be rusty his first game back but I honestly doubt it. Also, the fact that he plays *every* night is selfish. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if I were single I would play every night, but that\u2019s disrespectful of your partners time. Things change when you get in a relationship and it sounds like he\u2019s not willing to change his ways. \n\nI don\u2019t have any advice as to how to come to an amicable resolution but I find the notion of taking his PC on vacation as ridiculous as you.", "NTA.  If your boyfriend has a hard 24/7/365 9PM curfew so he can play Rainbow Six with his boys, that's a dealbreaker, ladies", "NTA this is a reasonable request. However as always Reddit give the shittiest advices.", "NTA. There is absolutely no reason he needs to take his whole ass PC with him on vacation.", "NTA. My bf and I are huge gamers. When we've gone on trips before we never even thought about bringing our pcs. I think brought the Nintendo twitch on our 5 day trio once but we're too busy to even use it", "This sounds like something my friend\u2019s ex husband would do. (Notice I said \u201cex\u201d!) He constantly prioritized gaming/his own interests over her and eventually she had enough and dumped him. There\u2019s more to the story of course, but suffice it to say, that was not a healthy relationship. Just something to think about\u2026..\n\nNTA.", "Nta. Hes the ah\nThe fact that he's calling you selfish in this situation is infuriating. You're not trying to control him you're trying to actually spend time with your partner on vacation. No going out after 9 pm because he has to play the same game every day? As someone who regularly games that's beyond pathetic and silly. He plays the same game EVERY DAY it won't kill him to take a 4 day break. Honestly you should rethink this relationship as a whole. If he doesn't love you enough to realize he's being unreasonable here this will never change. He values rainbow six seige more than you.", "NTA.  \n\nThe killer for me here is that he\u2019s known about this trip for some time.  I understand he has a hobby that is important to him and we competes with his friends.  However, it\u2019s not like you dropped this on him last minute.  He\u2019s had time to let his teammates know and prepare for his absence.  However, he chose not too.  He cares more about keeping up with his team/friends than spending quality time with you past 9pm.  On a vacation.", "Staying in the same time zone. We about a 4 hr drive from the beach", "You don't every do those things because he doesn't care to, and will never prioritize you.\n\nI was married to gaming addict for years (EverQuest) and his wants (dopamine from gaming) always came first.\n\nOver sex. Over meals. Over spending time with people in RL. And over my crying, begging, and hurt feelings.", "Honestly, I question whether he's as invested as she is in this vacation.  She made it clear that she plans a vacation every year.  She wanted to make it private.  She did all of the planning.  I wonder just how much of a say he had in these plans.", "his bad attitude about the wifi and not being able to play would almost certainly ruin op\u2019s vacation. bad advice lol", "Same, I play video ganes here and there, but the point of vacation is to get out of comfort zone and try new things and have fun. Not sit in hotel playing games which he does every night", "\"I ignore and belittle my girlfriend, but I'm not an asshole, that's my life!\" \"I refuse to spend time with my partner because I go to bar with buddies and hookup with randos, but can't be an asshole, that's just my life\"", "the one and only Y-T-A", "Maybe we're just different people, but if you would rather sit in a hotel room playing video games instead of going out and having fun and experiencing new things, that's sad and depressing.

It is an extremely unpleasant old thing", "Calling dancing fun is subjective.  Saying it's a new thing is objectively...wrong.", "Good god your life sounds depressing, you must be fun at parties", "Clearly it's new to him", "Depends entirely on the party.  And your life probably sounds depressing to others as well, but you don't consider that, do you?", "Oh how terrible of me to not enjoy dancing, how awful I am!", "No, I'm sure he knows what dancing is.  I'm sure he's seen and experienced it before.  I don't like to dance.  I hate clubbing.  The reason why I can confidently tell you that is that I have certainly danced in my life and I have been clubbing at least once."]}
