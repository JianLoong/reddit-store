This is something I\u2019ve always done every year whether it\u2019s with a friend group, family, or S/O, so it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been anticipating for basically an entire year. \n\nThis year I wanted to make it a private trip for me and my boyfriend who we\u2019ll call Brad. I\u2019ve already booked and paid for the hotel and a few of the activities we\u2019ll be doing, which I was bringing up to him to see if there\u2019s anything else that he would specifically like to do. I eventually brought up the fact I\u2019d like to go bar hopping and see some live music and/or go walk on the beach at night when Brad said we couldn\u2019t do anything after 9pm since he would be playing video games.\n\nBrad plays Rainbow Six Siege with a group of his college friends on his gaming PC. They play every night in order to practice for some sort of competition/tournament they have coming up. It\u2019s nothing professional esports level or anything, but I know they do take it seriously and I understand and respect that. I play games on my own PC myself so I understand. But seeing as how they need to practice, he says he\u2019s bringing his entire PC setup to the beach with us.\n\nI tried bringing up the fact I was hoping the trip could be more intimate and focused around us doing stuff together since it\u2019s only a 4 day/3 night trip and we wouldn\u2019t be gone that long. Brad is adamant on bringing his PC, and saying that me trying to convince him not to is selfish and he feels like I\u2019m controlling him and how he spends his time. His main argument point is that we have all day to do stuff and he only wants to be on his PC at night. He also said I should bring my PC so we can play games together, but we don\u2019t even play games together while we\u2019re at home since I don\u2019t play R6 and he constantly has a full group anyways. \n\nI\u2019m trying to put my foot down about this and the argument has come to the point where he is saying he won\u2019t come on the trip if he can\u2019t bring it and have his gaming time at night.\n\nAITA for wanting a trip without his PC coming along with us?", "created_utc": 1688089062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mmtby/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_bring_his/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole vacation would be to get away for a little while, and spend time together, not play video games while you do what? I doesn\u2019t seem your SO is willing to make that sacrifice, and to me that seems selfish.", "NTA. Sometimes putting down technology is the healthiest thing he can do to live in the moment. This is going to be one of those times. Gaming with the boys is fun but you need to make time for your significant other as well.  \n\n\nBe firm on this one, he's being a child.", "He plays EVERY NIGHT? That's really not necessary. I love videogames, don't get me wrong, but I couldn't justify playing them every night after 9 pm. Unless I was a professional and my income depended on it\u2014I'm assuming he isn't.\n\nIt's not even the videogames. There's not a single activity that I would absolutely have to do every night after 9 pm that would take priority over everything else, even activities with my partner on vacation.\n\nIt's super selfish that he is choosing to game every night without fail instead of spending time with you on a vacation that you planned.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's frankly concerning that your boyfriend can't put his game away for a few days to spend time with his girlfriend. Makes it very clear where you land on the priority list.", "You're not his gf, you're the side piece. He loves the computer and his games.\n\nEither make peace with that or make other decisions accordingly. \n\nNTA", "NTA. My husband likes to game as well, but if we are on a trip just the two of us, he wants to spend all his time with me. He may bring a switch to play when we have downtime.", "ABSOLUTELY NTA.  Vacation is a break from life and you are literally paying to break your routine.", "NTA, your bf is a loser", "NTA.  And your BF is nuts.  If I was one of his buddies I\u2019d refuse to let him play.  How does someone like this even have a GF?!?", "NTA\n\nYou just learned an expensive lesson that you come second to a video game.", "NTA. Brad, however, is an absolute AH. \n\nThis is vacation-ruining stuff and it shows he will never prioritise you. Selfish in the extreme. I enjoy video games, but I ensure that it doesn\u2019t interfere with even downtime in the evening (we both work irregular, non-matching hours). The thought of someone cutting off the vacation every night at 9pm is maddening. \n\nCall his bluff, go with a friend instead.", "**NTA**\n\nI had an ex like that.

If you are paying for all of this, or a significant chunk of this, you are definitely NTA for stressing that you have a say in how the two of you spend your time. If you're paying for all or mostly all of this, then his choices are either to go with sans PC you or stay home.You didn't mention this, but I would imagine the PC coming with you also entails that from 9pm onwards, you're in the room with \"ROTATE LEFT!! CONTACT! DRONES UP... OK... SHIT!! FUCK... GO BACK!!!  ...GET REKT!!!\"???\n\nI'm so sympathetic to your situation, because I know you don't want to be on this awesome vacation and Brad is just pouting all the time... nor do you want to feel like you have no say and just give into whatever he wants.\n\n~~Maybe explore a compromise that you both can live with? What if the deal is that the PC comes along, but is only setup for 2 nights... and then the other 2 nights he agrees that the damn thing stays in his luggage?~~  EDIT: I'm giving Brad too much credit. If he knows he could be gaming on the off-nights and is PC is RIGHT FUCKING THERE, he's going to be thinking about it non-stop. Nah, PC needs to stay at home. \n\nAnother tactic -- say the PC doesn't come along with you. Is there a world in which you guys go do a nighttime activity and both leave your phones in the hotel room? I know it's a big ask, but this is the best way to keep him away from his friends pinging him on discord, him checking in on the bois, or otherwise finding sneaky ways to 'work' on his upcomming competition.", "NTA and take him on his offer to not go.  It sucks, you want to spend time with him, but he is showing you he is not actually worth your time.  Start asking your friends now, I don\u2019t think it will be as hard to find a replacement companion for this trip as you think.  Then while you are away you can think about whether or not you want to continue to be second fiddle to video games.", "NTA. It\u2019s a VACATION from everyday life. It\u2019s weird that he isn\u2019t comfortable taking a few days off from his friends", "NTA.... its for 3 nights, there are tons of stuff to do at night for vacation, sometimes the most fun.\n\nInvite someone else. you should have a great time on your vacation, day and night.", "Are you tho king about making babies with this guy?  Cause he won\u2019t change a diaper or make a bottle after 9 PM.  NTA", "Wait, so you've already been planning this vacation with your BF for a few months, and he mentions wanting to bring his gaming PC with him *now*? You'd have figured this would've been one of the very first things to get straight during the planning. I guess not. If the nightly gaming sessions are so important to him, I don't know why the vacation planning was even allowed to hit the *one*-month mark.\n\nAnyway, isn't the whole point of a vacation to take a break from a person's regular routine? To relax and do other things for a bit while having a fun time?\n\nBut also, you mention this is a gaming PC, as in a whole desktop setup with monitors, keyboard, mouse, and other things, right? That would take up a *lot* of room. I would at least give your BF a very slight amount more credit if this were a gaming laptop we were talking about, but I can't fathom bringing an entire PC setup, no way.\n\nNTA", "NTA!!\n\nEdit: I see now you commented they don't play for money.. Then wtf are they practicing for!??? Are they working up to compete someday? Cause there are a ton of small events non professional teams play and actually get rewards and the event is hosted and everything. Your bf is out of touch. \n\n\nyeah I understand having to practice but he was out of line with what he told you. \"and how he spends his time\" well he can spend it at home since his time doesn't involve you not even in gaming since he always has a full lobby anyways.\n\nIt's sad you guys don't play games together as well. Me and my bf met through CSGO and been living together for nearly 3 years now . We met at the end of 2018 and started dating in 2020 and we always play games together and always have. Of course we have our own games we play separately. I play ESO and he loves to play a variety of small games mostly hack and slash.\n\nGirl, you deserve someone who includes you not act like you are in the way. You shouldn't have to make it clear to your partner you want quality time. A relationship comes first.", "NTA. Tell him to take his gaming PC and fuck off. Or, if you want to be super, super petty about it, let me know and I'll tell you how to delete all the files off his computer.", "NTA. If his gaming is so important then leave him at home and find someone else to go on holiday with, or go on your own and have a great time. There is no reason for you to miss out or be second fiddle to a computer game because of Brad\u2019s selfishness", "Yeah NTA, but he definitely is. As previously stated, vacations are for getting away from the absurdity of everyday bs we call life. Have I taken a game console to a hotel with us before? Sure, but it was never unpacked unless it was raining and miserable outside, but that was mostly for sanity's sake and never on a romantic getaway. \n\nI do find the visual in my head rather humorous though. Are you maybe confusing PC with laptop? I honestly can't see someone dragging an entire gaming rig on vacation. Either way, still not cool.", "Girl just end this relationship, good god. You seem like you're interested in living in the real world, making memories, having experiences. He isn't. Find someone who values the same lifestyle as you.", "I honestly don\u2019t think either of you are really assholes, but neither of you are willing to compromise your happiness. A vacation is supposed to be spent doing what you wanna do, not what someone else wants you to do. Is it fair to call it a vacation for him if he isn\u2019t able to do what he enjoys? I don\u2019t think so, but same does go for you as you want more intimate quality time. \n\nSo one thing I also wanted to point out, if he does leave his PC home. Whatever y\u2019all do at night won\u2019t be as nice as you want. He\u2019ll be holding that bit of resentment in and it\u2019ll probably end up being worse, \n\nAt this point, I think you\u2019d be better off going with someone else who would enjoy the things you will, instead of forcing your boyfriend to ditch his happiness to do what you want. Since he clearly has his foot down and so do you, I don\u2019t see any other solution really", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
