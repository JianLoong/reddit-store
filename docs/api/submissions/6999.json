You left a four year old with complete strangers, in a place she\u2019s never been before, knowing she was nervous and wanted you to be there, to go to a sixteen year old\u2019s soccer game\u2026. To me it\u2019s not even the fact it\u2019s your sister vs your child. ITS THE FACT YOUR DAUGHTER IS FREAKING FOUR AND YOU LEFT HER LIKE THAT. YTA.

If you have to chose between attending events for either of them, the 4 year old should be priority", "YTA\n\nEven if they were equally the same, you had a nervous 4 year old and a 16 year old with events at the same time. The 4 year old is less capable of handling the situation than the 16 year old.\n\nAnd, yes, your daughter should actually be a priority. Don't have a kid if you can't do that. Whether you realize it or not, you did rank both kids, and chose your sister over your daughter. In a situation where it didn't even make logical sense to do so", "Soft YTA.  You should've taken your 4 year old.  Your 16 year old sister - though disappointed - would have the bandwidth and emotional maturity to understand.  But your wife though - also the AH.  Your sister is functionally your daughter - you've been raising her since she was a child and you shouldn't have to *pick* which one is more important if they're both your children.  In this instance, you should've supported the younger one, but your wife is wrong that your daughter is more important because she's your \"creation\".  That's just weird.", "YTA but not beacuse of what your wife said, she's wrong and an AH because of that.  \nBut your daughter is small and asked for your support, and you failed her!

I can't even imagine not supporting your four year old daughter in this.", "Info: I\u2019m having trouble with the problem statement. The timelines don\u2019t work here unless you had someone else to get the kid from dance class. A four year old\u2019s dance class might last an hour.  A high school soccer game has 80 minutes of playing time plus time outs & the time between periods.

Should be\u2026.but idk you didn\u2019t understand that your 4 YEAR OLD needed you more and you\u2019re 27. She shouldn\u2019t be mad over how you feel but over being a smart responsible PARENT!", "YTA. You left a 4 year old little girl who told you she was scared completely alone with adults she does not know or trust in order to sit in the bleachers and watch a soccer game of a 16 year old who did not need the amount of emotional support from you. 4 years old is a critical year for the emotional development of children. You demonstrated that you will not be an adult she can count on going forward. You screwed up with your daughter. Hopefully, you can fix it before repeating a pattern where your daughter learns you will abandon her when she is fearful.", "You just \u201cdropped off\u201d your 4 year old nervous child and think that is ok? THIS why you are YTA - massively", "YTA. There is a huge difference in the ability between a 4 year old and a 16 year olds ability to understand reasoning. Not to mention it was your daughters first recital and the other parent couldn\u2019t be there. She probably was nervous and felt devastated no one was there. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine\u201d. Really? You said that to a 4 year old and just thought they\u2019d understand no problem?!! \n\nAbsolutely YTA x1000000000000", "Dude, 4 vs 16. I think that your 16 year old would totally be understanding you had to be at the lil kiddos dance class.\n\nA good thing you could have done is apologize in advance to miss 16, wish her luck and maybe give her 20 bucks to grab some food with friends post game.\n\nEdit to add: Now that I think about it, a 1st time dance class for a 4 year old is like, 45 mins max? A high school soccer match would run much longer, I'm sure. If they both started around the same time you could have chaperoned the dance class and then bring the 4 year old to cheer on Auntie 16 for the rest if her game.", "YTA.  So a 4 year old was dropped off FOR THE FIRST TIME at a dance class by herself?  Seriously?  I know you said you'd be there for your sister's soccer match but this is just not right.  I feel so bad for your daughter.", "NTA. Your sister is effectively your child (and since she's a minor, I'm assuming you're her legal guardian?) This is like saying the bilogical child should be prioritized over the adopted one. No, they are both your responsibility equally. Where the kid came from is of no importance whatsoever. That being said, youve got to figure out a way to make it work with both. You couldn't have dropped your daughter and then stayed for maybe 10 or 20 minutes for her to settle in and then went and caught the second half of your sister's game? This is going to be an ongoing issue so you guys need to figure out a plan on how you'll handle these situations moving forward in a way that satisfies both kids.", "Look at you! Already showing your daughter how disappointing men can be by prioritizing other women. \n\nYou left you 4 year old DAUGHTER alone!!! I\u2019m sure your 16 year old SISTER would\u2019ve understood why her brother had to be at his DAUGHTER FIRST dance class.", "YTA \n\ndo you honestly not see what\u2019s wrong in just dropping a 4 year old off? After she told you she was nervous and asked you to stay? Because if you honestly don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what to tell you other then you are a bad father. \nWhy do people have Children when they are clearly not ready for them?! It makes me so angry.", "YTA she is 4 years old and didn\u2019t have a parent there? This isn\u2019t about you loving your daughter more it\u2019s about her being a child. You should have explained the situation to your sister and tried to make it up to her a different way. Someone was going to be hurt but I assume someone at 16 years old could emotionally handle it better then a child.  I would be curious to hear your wife\u2019s side as I feel like her words could mean child vs teen, first dance class vs highschool regular game and not daughter vs sister.", "YTA. Simple here, instead of talking to your sister about the situation, you chose to ditch your 4yr old daughter at her first dance class by herself. You should be ashamed of yourself for this action. That\u2019s just a very poor decision on your part Dad.", "N T A...edited to YTA  \n\nit's not a competition. And by that measure (blood) wife should come last? Not suggesting it.\nEdited because the age of daughter didnt register on my brain. Yes- 4yr old needs more support then 16 yr old", "YTA, dude she is 4. You needed to be there. This is truly insane behavior. Your sister is 16, it\u2019s a soccer game. She would understand. Poor kid, can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for a 4 year old to feel abandoned like this on stage. Your priorities are unbelievably screwed up, not due the familial relations but age. Turn it out today before you lose your wife and daughter.", "Oh my god I missed the age of the daughter on my first reading - *she's four?* Of course you should have gone with her! She was nervous and needed her father! Your sister would've been fine without you. Jesus imagine just dropping your kid off like \"have fun in this strange place sweetie, see you after the game!\" and zzoming off. Man YTA.", "Yta, she's 4, not 14. Who leaves a toddler alone with strangers when it's not absolutely necessary. You knew she was scared and you just left her alone. She saw all the other kids have parents there and you just left. It wasn't a championship game or some other once in a lifetime can't miss opportunity, just a regular game and you hurt your daughter's feelings", "Maybe you\u2019re overcompensating for the loss of your and your sister\u2019s parents? \nDoesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re thinking clearly,\nthis is neglect of the 4 yr old. \nYTA", "You are definitely the asshole here no doubt but not for the reason although yes they should both be equal in love sometimes your daughter will need to come first like in this instance. Your daughter was scared and had on one and wanted her dad there but because you had already said you would go to your sisters soccer match that you just dropped a 4 year old who was scared alone at a dance class. What you just taught her is that when she\u2019s scared she can\u2019t count on daddy to be there so when she stops coming to you for things don\u2019t get mad at her it\u2019s your own fault your showing her at a young age where she\u2019s very impressionable that she doesn\u2019t matter to you that your sister matter more that\u2019s all she will know she\u2019s to young to understand the complexities of being double booked. A 16 year old however is someone who will understand and probably if knew about it would have told you to go to your 4 year olds dance class. I say probably as I don\u2019t know your sister but if she loves your daughter then I assume she would have. All you hav done is managed to possibly hurt your daughter in a way that could effect her long term especially if it repeats often and possibly create a resentment of her aunt cause she gets priority over her that\u2019s how she will see it. As someone who was abandoned and then had an older sister that family would go to her stuff but not mine trust me it builds a resentment and an anger that is hard to deal with since from a young age I was shown I wasn\u2019t as important as her so even though now I know the \u201creasons\u201d it doesn\u2019t help that pain or hurt I felt at the time. \nNow your wife is a bit rude in the way she went about it but she was mad for good reason in this situation and while yes they are technically equal priority there should be a bit more priority for your daughter because of the age she is at your sister in two years probably won\u2019t even live with you and will be starting her life and college. Your daughters FIRST dance class is important more important than a regular soccer game that you can see an their one next week  a first dance class can\u2019t happen again and you left her alone she was probably terrified and really upset with you I think you should feel and worry more about the emotional damage you did to your daughter today rather than your wife being mad at your for prioritizing your sister over your daughter.", "YTA, not for loving equally, but because you ditched your 4 year old without so much as a by your leave.\n\nOne day, she\u2019s going to bring it up, and it\u2019s going to suck to have to explain to your kid why you went to a soccer game and let her go somewhere unfamiliar all by herself.", "You clearly favor your sister over your daughter. Are you always going to put your sister over your daughter? Good luck having a relationship with your daughter when she is older. I still remember when I was 5 and thought my dad was going to eat lunch with me at school so I didn't get anything to eat so I could wait for my dad and he never showed. I broke down. You disgust me.", "YTA. You left a 4yo at a new environment on her own. She would have seen all the other kids there with their parents except for her. Your 16yo sister would have understood, in fact that age group is when families regular do the drop and dash anyway so it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal for her.", "I disagree with your wife\u2019s statements, but not her anger.  Your daughter NEEDED a parent there, and as her parent, this was your responsibility.  She\u2019s 4!  Your sister just wanted you there.  The two are not comparable, but not for the reasons your wife stated.  Want vs need.", "YTA. Your daughter is 4 and way too young to understand why you abandon her. A 16 year old is more mature and more likely to understand why you can\u2019t go. If she doesn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t raise her right.\n\nAlso, the first dance is such a big thing, and you missed it. Your daughter would have been so scared and nervous. While your 16 year old sister would have had more experience.\n\nYour daughter\u2019s first big dance was ruined by you.\n\nThey are not equal because one is 16, the other is 4.\n\nYou might be a good brother, but you\u2019re an awful dad.", "NTA because it seems like this is the result of communication problems. You said you only found out about the dance class after committing to go to your sister\u2019s soccer match. I\u2019m assuming you found out from your wife? Did she schedule this without telling you and assume you would be there, then spring it on you last minute? Or was your wife planning on being there and work kept her late?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly how this conflict happened, and seems like it is more an issue of poor communication and time management. I might question your judgement of the correct response in the situation since a 4yo needs more handholding than a 16yo, but I don\u2019t think it makes you TA.", "Info: are you aware of developmental milestones and benchmarks for children like\u2026.at all? Was your wife saying the 4 year old is the priority because she\u2019s your daughter or because she\u2019s a preschooler who doesn\u2019t have the same social maturity or critical thinking that your sister does? Does your wife take on a majority of childcare for your daughter because of how you parent your sister?", "YTA. For leaving your 4 year old alone in a place she's never been with people she doesn't know.", "Nobody's the asshole? I think you should have handled it differently. The age difference being a big deal. A 16 year old will understand much better than a 4 year old why you can/can't be there. Just use some common sense going forward, man. Ya'll sound like you have a nice little family, don't fuck it up.", "Wow, I could not imagine leaving my 4 year old alone like that. If it was a regular class where she was super familiar with lots of people, it might be ok, but first time with people she didn\u2019t know and was unfamiliar with? And you just waved her off. She is 4!!! The 16 year old would\u2019ve completely understood but the 4 year old probably doesn\u2019t. \n\nI can\u2019t also help but wonder who was keeping an eye on her during dance class if you didn\u2019t go in and your wife was at work? \nI only ask as a 16 year old is way more equipped to handle the world on her own vs a 4 year old. What if she\u2019d wandered off? Or gone to the toilet by herself and got lost? Or got scared by the unfamiliar people and started crying? 4 year olds are unpredictable and you left her exposed and vulnerable. \n\nI\u2019d have been pissed at you too. Though I don\u2019t agree with the comment about she\u2019s our creation. It\u2019s about her ability to understand and your responsibility to protect young children. YTA.", "You just left your 4 year old daughter?  Your sister is old enough that she doesn't need supervision at events.  Your daughter is too young to be left like that.  If my husband left my 4 year old by himself at a dance recital I would be livid.  YTA", "What I don't understand(and don't see asked here), is the soccer match would last about two hours.  The dance class can't be more than 30ish minutes for a four year old.  Couldn't you have watched the daughter dance class and then taken her with you to the soccer match?  Cuz as it stands, you probably had to leave the soccer match to go pick up the daughter after dance was over?", "Info: Does your sister live with you and your wife? Just trying to understand family dynamic better", "I don\u2019t think YTA for saying they\u2019re both equally important since you\u2019re raising them both, but you\u2019re absolutely TA for leaving a 4yo by herself. Leaving a 16yo by herself is not as dangerous as leaving a 4yo by herself. Your wife was right to be upset, but she needs to also understand you\u2019re parenting both children together. She needs to not prioritize one over the other.", "First of all, you're an amazing big brother!  Your daughter is 4; she forgot you existed approximately 5 minutes into the class. (I've been that parent with a 4 year old in dance class)  Do you know how it went after you left?  How long into the class did you wait before leaving?  I feel like I need more info.  Your sister is 16 and probably would've understood you needing to be there for your daughters first dance lesson.  As far as being the AH for loving your daughter and sister equally...no, NTA.", "YTA. You can love a 4 year old and a 16 year old equally but you have to understand they have completely different needs. The 16 year old would have loved to see you there but your 4 year old is being dropped off somewhere alone that she\u2019s never been before, she has less of an ability to cope and needed you in that moment more than the 16 year old did.", "YTA. Your 4 year old needed you more. That isn't showing favoritism that is prioritizing. She is 4 years old and you just dropped her off with a bunch of strangers. She will remember this and it may be that she won't come.to you in the future. \n\nYou should apologize and do something special with your daughter to let her that she can count on you and then you know. Follow through.", "YTA\n\nEasier to explain to a 16 yo whose games you've always gone to that you gotta go to the first dance of your small kiddo.\n\nLove them both as daughter? Then learn to try them equally as daughter!\n\nYou treated the 4yo as less than. As an afterthought. Do better.", "YTA.  IMO, a 4 year olds first dance class is more important than a 16 year olds soccer game. Even if they were both your biological children. For sooooooo many reasons.", "YTA- you 4 year olds comprehension skills aren\u2019t that of a 16 year old. The 16 year old should understand. You didn\u2019t treat them equally or fairly as you thought process failed to account for their age and developmental stage in life. You are babying and perhaps being preferential to the 16 year old to make up for the loss of her parents. That\u2019s why your wife is upset.", "You just left your 4yr old somewhere alone? Wtf", "YTA, as someone who has a daughter and also has a sibling who they had a hand in raising and views as her own child (my sibling jokingly calls me mom) you seriously messed up. Your sister is a teenager, she\u2019s grown and wanted you there for moral support\u2014which is important. However, her ability to play isn\u2019t banking on you being there, you could always explain the situation and make it up to her. Your young daughter was scared and nervous, she needed her parent there and you let her down. Was your wife right for saying that they aren\u2019t equal? No, only you can say that. However she was right in being upset that you missed your daughters first dance class.", "YTA. your heart is in the right place, but life just doesn\u2019t work like this. four years olds are not independent and cannot take care of themselves, so obviously, they come before sixteen year olds. what if your sister\u2019s soccer game ran late and no one was there to take care of your daughter? what if she was left alone? that\u2019s the issue here.", "YTA. You dropped your 4 year old off and left her alone? So you could go oogle high school girls?", "YTA. Both you and your wife are big AH.\n\nYou are doing great with your sister, but a 4 yo is always the priority because SHE IS FOUR YEARS OLD. \n\nYour wife, well, she just opened a door that won't close. She will force you to choose between sister and daughter.\n\nThe only victims here are the children.", "I\u2019m sorry that your parents passed, that must\u2019ve been tough for both of you. I hope you\u2019re both doing okay.", "YTA\n\nShould have talked to your sister and not leave a 4yo alone. Now your child thinks that you don't care about her. She said she was scared and wanted you there and you bailed. Do you think she will ask again?", "I mean YTA but that\u2019s not why. A 16 year old would have a much better understanding then a 4 year old, never mind one going to her FIRST dance class and being anxious", "I don't think saying or even feeling like you care equally about a sibling and a child is an asshole thing at all, most of us help raise our younger siblings especially when you're what 12 years older", "ESH (You and your wife, that is.)\n\nYou, because as much as your sister wanted you at her soccer match, the 4 year old was having an entirely new experience and needed you more.\n\nYour wife because you *are* parenting your sister and the only reason your daughter should have taken precedence in this situation is due to their relative ages and the double-booking.\n\nFor a time, I was caregiving for 2 seniors, acting as medical surrogate/interpreter for an uncle who is very hard of hearing, keeping track of my own appointments due to my own chronic health condition, and juggling all of those things with my full time work responsibilities. Having a good calendar system that could be updated from my mobile phone or computer was a sanity-saver. (I use Outlook, but use whatever works best for you. I prefaced all entries with a single word like \"work\", \"mine\", their first name ... you get the idea.) \n\nI strongly recommend that you and your wife set up a shared calendar (either can add events), especially now that your daughter is old enough to have her own activities. As long as you keep the system updated, at least you'll be able to see conflicts as they arise and avoid surprise double-bookings.", "NTA, they are both blood and family, you are literally the caretaker of your sister.", "YTA. She's four. Who was there for her?", "YTA\nThis isn't a daughter vs sister competition but your daughter is FOUR. She absolutely should be a priority and your 16 year old sister is old enough to understand that.  You only get so many firsts with your kid, she is a baby and at that age a parent NEEDS to be nearby in case of an emergency (or melt down) and because she needs emotional support. I would feel the same as your wife.", "She\u2019s FOUR. you\u2019re absolutely the asshole YTA", "wtf. You sent a scared little 4 year old to her first dance class alone. You told her before you'd be there. The only thing you gave her as compensation was \"everything will be fine\" and then you practically drove away with squealing tires. Your sister doesn't seem as important to you as your daughter, but more important. You had an appointment with your daughter first. I know that if a double booking occurs, the first appointment has priority if they are equally important. Your sister should have frends who are at her games. I just can't get over leaving a 4 year old with a bunch of strangers and then asking yourself how not to be the prick. How can you be so cold hearted. Most of the parents of the new dancers were probably there. But no parents for your poor daughter.", "You left the 4 year old alone in her first dance class? WTH is wrong with you? Your judgement is terrible.  The 4 year probably shouldn\u2019t be alone with you without a responsible adult. I guarantee you the 16 year old would understand. So much YTA.", "YTA because you didn\u2019t treat them as equally important you treated your daughter as less important. If the two were equally important then you would look at which needs you more. Your 4 year old needed you more than your sister did. She was in a strange situation with people she didn\u2019t know, which is very scary for a small child. Your sister was in a familiar situation and is much more able to handle things independently, she didn\u2019t need you she wanted you there. You prioritised your sister\u2019s wants over your daughter\u2019s needs, clearly showing which you feel is more important.", "YTA- I have a four year old Daughter and kid sisters. I love them all and they know it. The older kids would understand if you had to support your 4 year old daughter oh my goodness. Don't flake out on your child anymore, She's gonna grow up thinking she's not important to you. Poor girl.", "You seriously left a 4 year old alone in a strange place on her first day? You need to prioritize your daughter sir because she NEEDS you at the age of 4. Your sister did not need you at that game and would understand as she is much older and more independent. will you always pick your sister over your younger child since the older girl can ask first? It is unacceptable to all but abandon someone barely out of the toddler phase. Nobody is saying to throw your sister away but your little daughter is not going to understand why her dad would abandon her on her very first class ever. And how did you even slip away? Most dance classes require a parent to be present for younger children. You\u2019re likely to get your daughter kicked out if there can\u2019t be an adult there when she\u2019s there.", "YTA. When you found out about your daughters class, you should have talked to your sister about it. Your daughter needed you. It was her first class and you literally dropped her off and left. How long was the class anyway? I mean games can take a lot of time and most dance classes are like half an hour. Also, your wife is an AH too. Both are important to you and they should be.", "YTA\nThere was no need for this discussion to turn into a ranking of importance. You should have weighed your participation based on need and the individual's circumstances. In this case, it sounded like your daughter needed you more. Your sister should be able to understand that. \n\nY'all need a shared family calendar.", "I think you should\u2019ve stayed with your daughter, but only because she\u2019s a small child.  Your wife is a callous asshole.", "YTA Your daughter is still very young, and it was het first class, she was nervous. She needed you to be there way more than your sister did, your sister would be fine without you, your daughter might have needed you. Has nothing to do with who is more important imo.", "YTA. How can it not cross your mind that the 4 year old might have needed you more than the 16 year old in this case. I assume it could have been pretty easy to explain to your sister what happened and I\u2019d bet she would have also told you to go with your daughter. Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re fixating on the wrong part of that discussion. Given that you admit that you got upset when your wife (rightfully) told you that your daughter should have been the priority in this situation and that you\u2019re paraphrasing her response to you getting unjustifiably upset, I have to wonder whether you\u2019re taking what your wife said out of context or misinterpreted what she said. Resorting to \u201cI messed up, but YOU said\u2026\u201d or trying to look like the better person to \u201cwin\u201d the argument or make yourself feel better isn\u2019t helpful. However, even if she said exactly what you\u2019re conveying, fixating on the thing your wife said while ignoring your screwup isn\u2019t going to make things right or prevent this issue from happening again. \n\nYou can care about your sister and daughter equally (as you should!) and still recognize that one of them needed you more than the other. Your sister is much more emotionally mature than your daughter, she was in a much more familiar environment, and she is much more capable of understanding a scheduling mix up. Plus, if your sister was asking you to be at the game, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s had games where you weren\u2019t there before. Your daughter was in a new place, surrounded by strangers, and probably saw other kids whose parents were there while she was alone. The logistics alone should have made the choice clear. \n\nThen there\u2019s the safety concerns that come along with the situation. I\u2019m really hoping you at least walked your daughter into her classroom and didn\u2019t just dump a 4 year old on the curb. But what would have happened if either event got out early or one of the girls was injured? Your sister knows her teammates and coach who could give her a ride or be her emotional support, but your daughter was alone with nobody she knew. Given the amount of horror stories on the news on any given day, I don\u2019t think I need to elaborate on worse-case scenarios. But if your wife really does see your daughter as more important than your sister, how do you imagine things will be for your sister if something terrible happened to your daughter while you were at your sister\u2019s game? \n\nA better solution would have been for you to apologize to your sister for the scheduling mix up, go to your daughter\u2019s first dance class, and then try to make it to the rest of the game. I bet your sister would have loved to have you AND her niece cheering her on. \n\nMoving forward, you need to learn to prioritize.", "I think the title to this needs a little tweaking: \u201cAITA for dumping my 4 year old daughter at her first dance class alone to go watch my younger teenage sister\u2019s soccer game?\u201d\nI understand that both your daughter and sister are important to you, but a 4 year old isn\u2019t going to understand why her dad left her at a time she was scared and needed him.

Both are essentially have the daughter role now, so you are right about that. Sure it's an AH move typically to promise you'll show up to a game and not go, but the reason for needing to ditch the soccer game is valid and your sister is old enough to understand that. It's also an AH move to ditch your toddler without a parent around for a scary 1st time doing something. Your sister probably would feel bad knowing she kept you from your daughter's first dance recital, too. \n\nI say as close to an AH as you can get without being the AH, only because your intentions were definitely solid, and I can see how it would be a confusing situation initially, and you sound like a person who wouldn't repeat this mistake again.

She knows all she needs to do is tell me if she needs me to handle something. \n\nMost days I come home from work and she has already taken them to practice while they are gone I do dishes and get dinner ready.  Except for football season I coach one of their teams so I run to practice as well. \n\nMe being the breadwinner gives her the opportunity to do whatever she wants. If she wants to get a job great. If she wants to stay at home great. If she wants to go out with friends for drinks in the middle of the day great. She has that freedom to choose to do what she wants. We've been together for almost 20 years because we found a system that works for us.  \n\nFyi I got up at 4 am this morning because I heard of of the kids not feeling well. Not her. I let her sleep.

She used to prior to having kids she made about double what I made.  We had kids and she made the decision to stay at home with the kids.  It is what she wanted.

Regardless if they are equal in your mind, you sure are TA for telling your wife you feel that way.

Your sister didn't need you there for emotional support, your 4 year old did.\n\n\nSo you need to look at yourself and think about if you are prioritizing your sister because your parents died and that had an effect on her so you over compensate, and expect your 4 year old to understand because she hasn't been through what your sister has.", "YTA for your actions, not for loving the two kids the same. You can love two kids the same and acknowledge that they're at different points in their emotional development and that the two events are not equally important.

I think you need to start with an apology for making the wrong judgment call in this particular situation- one event was clearly more important than the other, even if you promised to go to the less important event before you realized.  Once you are past that, you and wife need to talk about this idea that you should value your daughter more. You have basically become the parent for your sister and to treat her or see her as less important would be cruel and wrong.

They take their children into the lobby of the studio and the teacher's assistant waits with them until 5 minutes before class starts and then she takes them into the Studio and the adults are required to leave the building. It was the same way when I was a kid and when I was working in a Pre-K 4 class we did the same thing.

Wow um your wife is not all in with your sister. A four year old is less likely to remember you were not there. But your sister is an orphan like you and you will be where she returns to for Christmas, holidays, college brakes. Is your wife committed to that? Is your wife aware that this is a lifetime commitment? I think y\u2019all may need couples counseling to realize what this actually means. At this moment I would be more concerned about y\u2019all\u2019s relationship and the future. Good luck.", "yta NOT because they are of equal importance quiet frankly you have raised your sister so she is like a daughter to you and that\u2019s fine.. but this was your daughters first dance class but your sister has had other games and was just another game.. it was a championship she wasn\u2019t getting an award or anything so in THIS case your daughter should have been the priority.. that was a first class and to just leave her there by herself probably caused her a lot of anxiety even if she didn\u2019t show it. your sister is old enough to know that while you will always be there for her and she is a priority your daughter first dance class was a bigger priority at that time then a normal game.", "NTA. I believe I'm in the minority. Your sister was in a game, your daughter was just going to class, it's not like it was a dance recital. I get  she was nervous as it was her first night. Since you couldn't make it your wife should have moved hell on Earth to be able to take off from work to be there for her daughter so you could be there for your sister. It's unfortunate they overlapped and you couldn't have done both. But, what you could have done done is gone to the dance class taking your daughter in told her you were going to stay for a little while and then once you saw she was comfortable then you could have left. You would have missed a little bit of the game possibly with your sister but you would have been able to do both.  I'm sure your daughter was okay and isn't scarred for life.", "YTA. I\u2019m surprised the dance studio even met you drop and go on the first class at this age. \n\nYikes!\n\nThey should be equally important.

That's a long way off from equal treatment.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut note that the dance was not important enough for your wife to make sure SHE could be there.", "YTA. That poor little girl must have been so scared!", "YTA. Why would you leave a 4-year old by herself at a class?!?", "YTA. Not because you love them both but because you let a 4 yo think that their dad doesn't care because let's be honest that's the level of a 4yos understanding where as you could've spoken to your sister as a 16 yo and explain that whilst it is important you need to support your daughter because she is a small child.", "YTA my niece and I have the same exact age gap that your daughter and sister do. My older sister and I have the same exact age gap that you and your sister do.\n\nIf my niece had her first dance class on the same day as one of my games I would actually skip my own game to come watch her.

Even when equally important to you, you have to think about their perspectives. A 16 year old who is a well adjusted individual would fully understand why a 4 year old would need you. Your 4 year old may not understand your decision but what she will understand is that she was left \"alone\". My 4 year old does ballet and the classes are 30 minutes. My husband and I take turns taking her to class. Us just being their is a comfort to her even if she cannot see us when she's in the classroom. Sometimes even in that small window of time she needs things (bathroom breaks, water) and if we weren't there to help her that would be an awful experience for her as well as an extra burden on the staff (leotards and small children...).", "Not for saying they have equal priority, no. But for dumping 4 yr old off on her own because you made a proir commitment to a 16-year-old. She is 16, and she should be able to understand the situation.

They might be equal in the love you have for them but why on earth wouldn't the toddler be top of the priority list?\n\n\nYour sister is literally old enough to have a child herself.

It was her first ever dance class and she was frightened, and you left her alone to deal with it.\n\nIn her little mind, you just taught her that she's not important to you, and that you won't be there for her if she needs.

First dance class for a 4 year old is not more important but you should have talked to the walking talking rational 16 year old and gone to the dance class.

It's nowhere close to being the same thing as a 16 year old wanting you to show up to a random game. By not being there for such a young child you failed your daughter and possibly caused a lasting emotional scar. There is no comparison, at 16 your sister should be mature and empathetic enough to realize a 4 year old would need to come first in this situation.
