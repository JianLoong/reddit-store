I work full time as a surgical nurse, she\u2019s e still a student. \n\nWe spend most of our together time at my apartment since she lives with her parents and I live alone. But we hang out at hers place too, I have a pretty friendly relationship with her parents. \n\nNow since we spend most of the time at my place, and I\u2019m the one working and earning money, I take care of paying for stuff we do or buy together. I never even thought about it, for me it\u2019s a normal thing. I don\u2019t mind it at all. But we do cook for us a lot and well let\u2019s just say 99% of the time it\u2019s me who cooks. \n\nEven when we meet in the evening after my 12 hour shift, when she\u2019s home with parents all day, I\u2019m the one cooking dinner. And at some point I realized that dishes just always kinda stay there and then she leaves the next morning and I do the dishes and clean up the kitchen. I make the bed, clean up the bedroom etc. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being an ass but in mind I just thought for a second that I\u2019m cooking, paying for everything, cooking what she wants to eat that day. Why wouldn\u2019t she at least help with the dishes? So I kinda mentioned it casually when cooking. I just said something like \u201cit would be amazing if you could help with the dishes after!\u201d And she was like sure yes but then again same scenario she didn\u2019t even touch them. One time she cooked, I helped her with most of it and then I did all the dishes telling her I\u2019m gonna go clean up since she cooked and it was an amazing food! But yea not much changed after. Then one morning I tell her that the dishes are still there and she promised she will do them. And she ends up all angry about it. \n\nSo AITA for asking this of her? Is it too soon in a relationship or is it an asshole thing to ask of her? \n\nTLDR: AITA for asking my gf to do dishes (doesn\u2019t live with me but sleeps over often ) when I always cook and pay for everything we do and buy together? I will cook after a 12 hour shift and she still would get mad I asked if she could maybe help with clean up after cooking.", "created_utc": 1704625754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190pwjm/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_do_the_dishes_when_i/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s still living at home and probably gets most things done for her and she\u2019s expecting the same from you.", "NTA.  She should have offered and done them consistently months ago.", "NTA. This is already telling you what kind of person your GF is.", "NTA, your gf acts like a child.  What I might do in this case is start setting expectations, chores one of them would be dishes.  If she's been home all day and your coming off your 12 hr shift, encourage her to get her behind in the kitchen and help... in other words teach her how to cook.  It's a sad reality when basic life skill aren't being taught or used.  A relationship is a 2 way street and not everything is on your shoulders simply because your becoming more established in your career and she's still in college.", "NTA - Your gf needs to become your ex just for playing the \u201csexist\u201d card at you. She is too immature and clearly has no concept of how healthy partnerships work.

Your GF should have stepped up after the first time you did though.\n\nOne person cooks, the other does the dishes is a fair general rule.\n\nThese are definitely the sort of things that need to be resolved if you're thinking of living with her full time. Laziness & not pulling her weight are potential  big red flags.", "Sounds like yours haven't communicated the issue well enough with her. Could you try and have a conversation about this, at a time that there's no dishes to be done? Tell her that you'd really like her to chip in more, to do chores more equally. If she agrees, try to figure out how to split the chores. Maybe she'd like to cook more often. Maybe the both of you would like to cook and do the dishes together all the time. Just talk about it and see what the two of you come up with that both or you find reasonable. She's 23. She's an adult who should be able to do those things properly.\n\nIf she's reluctant to chip in, well, that's that I guess. Then you know what you got and it's up to you to either accept it or move on.", "NTA, this is common dinner at friends etiquette- whoever doesn't cook or contribute in other way cleans up? It ain't even romantic thing or sharing chores when living together.", "NTA, I thought it was a standard that whoever doesn't cook does the dishes. It is common courtesy and has zero to do with how long you've been dating.", "NTA. At best, she's just thoughtless, immature and lacks insight into how hard you work and what chores need to be done. At worst, she's immature, lazy, entitled and thinks she's a princess who doesn't have to lift a finger and expects her partner to cater to her every need. Either way, you're NTA.", "NTA. I have the same agreement with my SO, one cooks, the other one does the dishes.\n\nClearly she is used to be catered to by her parents. And now she has found a new parent in you. She sounds lazy and entitled. If you find these good qualities, you have found your match!\n\nOtherwise, I would move on.", "It sounds like her parents haven\u2019t instilled independence and are fostering dependence. At her age, she should understand that adults contribute to the household workload. I\u2019d rethink this relationship because at this stage of her life, she just gave you a glimpse of your future together.

But let\u2019s just say she wasn\u2019t ever taught that. You asked her nicely if she could help out, she said she would, she didn\u2019t follow through, you reminded her, and she flips out.

When I\u2019m at my partner\u2019s house I\u2019d do the dishes even if we order take out since we don\u2019t eat from takeout boxes. You can already tell that there\u2019s a weird dynamic in OP\u2019s relationship. It may seem small and petty now but it\u2019s a good indication of one\u2019s character. Just my 2 cents.", "What a selfish, entitled person.", "Stop cooking for her . Tell her to go and eat at her parent's house.

If you cook, she can clean that's fair.", "Is this the future you want?  GF is a princess who wants to be taken care of.  Find yourself a partner,  not a child.", "NTA, ditch the mooch.", "No, you're not an Asshole. My wife cooks 99% of the time, and I do the clean-up. It's called helping each other out.", "ESH I do see where you're coming from and it's mature of you to recognise you want a partner chiefly. Absolutely commit to the next person that doesn't need to be asked to help out. That said you don't live together, something which forces the conversation of expectations going forward and sort of means she's still your guest there however comfortable both of you have become.\n\nIf you were dating someone in the same stage of life as you it'd be an easy no, her not having reached that post-student adopting of adult responsibilities and entering her first big go-round of life in the workforce like you... Well let's just say it makes her of average maturity for her age rather than immature compared to you. Knowing that she might say the words and won't do it is halfway to the knowledge that maybe it wasn't your most sustainable pursuit in life to bank on the credited maturity of someone whom the core of society simply doesn't expect to have their shit together for another few years. Set her free to enjoy it and catch that warm fuzzy when she wants to get back together complaining about this in someone else in the future", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s young and possibly naive so needs a little explanation / opportunity to grow and learn and build experience. No one is perfect at 23 (big growing years early 20s)", "I agree with this. Also, y'all need to have a general conversation about what chores you do and don\u2019t like to do. It might be that she hates cooking and dishes but wouldn\u2019t mind helping with laundry or cleaning the bedrooms and bathrooms but feels like that\u2019s beyond her role since you don\u2019t live together. Or, she hasn\u2019t learned how and is embarrassed about it. \nBut most likely it\u2019s just the age difference and the fact that she lives at home and isn\u2019t used to needing to do a lot of this stuff. So you have to talk about those expectations and figure it out.", "If you read OP\u2019s post he has tried repeatedly to communicate with her to no avail. Imho the age and life experience gap here is too big for longterm compatibility. He needs to date another actual independent adult.", "Sounds like he has tried repeatedly to ask her to step up over the last year. It\u2019s certainly not about being perfect\u2014it\u2019s about being an equal partner and loving and respecting your partner. How many times does he have to keep asking for her to change her behavior? Both of them are young\u2026but If she isn\u2019t inclined to change her [lazy, entitled, and selfish] behavior, he should bow out and find someone more on his level.  Sometimes those \u201clife lessons\u201d are learned when one gets dumped\u2014or when one realizes that they\u2019re the one putting in all the effort for someone who doesn\u2019t even respect them.", "Repeatedly you mean twice?\n\nBut yes I agree with the age gap/compatibility comment", "Oh my bad, I forgot that 23yr old infants need well over 10000 reminders of basic consideration and decency, not to mention etiquette. Surely they cannot observe for themselves that their partner cooked an entire meal after 12hr shift and might appreciate the basic act of kindness/courtesy of jumping in to help with dishes after. Thank you for reminding me that painfully low standards are the norm for relationships today.", "I\u2019m just pointing out that this does not necessarily need to be a make or break for their relationship. He\u2019s obviously with her for a reason??? There is clearly a differing in alignment of expectation/ understanding of roles and then if the 23yo cannot engage in the adult conversation about it then it\u2019s not OP job to train her for this and should move on if becomes ongoing issue. As mentioned she got angry about it so possibly not able to have this conversation but surely benefit of the doubt should be given first.", "He\u2019s been giving the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d to her for over 8 months\u2014 and simmering away in resentment. That\u2019s plenty of time for most people to have a \u201cmake or break\u201d kind of revelation, and again, her age is no excuse for lacking basic consideration and respect towards her partner. ETA: Who knows what his \u201creasons\u201d are\u2026but there is zero reason to remain in the \u201cone way street\u201d type of relationship he has been settling for. He might be finally discovering that he deserves and wants more from a partner (we can hope) and it is precisely the \u201clittle things\u201d (like helping with dishes) that add up.", "You don\u2019t know that for sure - and again if partner is unaware of this expectation or annoyance they cannot attempt to remedy it. If OP has only addressed it recently then he has only contributed to his \u201cone way\u201d relationship over that period. We obviously cannot know the full extent of the details surrounding this but only if what your backing (based on assumption) if true would I agree with your argument here", "That\u2019s what I said \u2014 we don\u2019t have ALL the details but what is provided is PLENTY to go on in terms of assessing that this guy isn\u2019t being treated right. But seriously I am now why are you so passionately rationalizing him being in a relationship a woman who treats her male partner like a servant??! She has been told. She has eyes to see the dishes. She lives in the year 2024 where it is normal and good to help with dishes.\nGoodnight. I\u2019m out."]}
