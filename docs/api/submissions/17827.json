If you had concerns you should have had a conversation with her husband about it. It really doesn\u2019t sound like the \u201cdare\u201d is why he married and has two children with this woman. Yeah how it happened sucks but you suck for hurting her many many years after the fact.", "Sheesh... I have to vote ESH - except S. I understand where you were coming from but you did the wrong thing, plain and simple.\n\nThe right thing would have been to confront your boyfriend and D and tell them that they have to admit to this whole fucked up thing and that S deserves to know the truth. That would have given D the chance to explain himself and lighten the blow. People can be assholes but he apparently changed and fell in love with the woman. He should have had the balls to admit  to his faults and come clean. But you should have had given him that chance first and not gone behind their back. That poor woman must be hurt so fucking much.\n\nFor everyone saying though that you're the only AH - Nope. Definitely your boyfriend and D are AH as well. Being young is no excuse to being this explicietly cruel and then not even having the backbone to admit to yourself being shitty.\n\nEdit: I wanna add that using this whole thing as a \"funny backstory\" is also super assholish of your boyfriend.

Question why he held onto the old contract, why D got married and had kids but your BF hasn't, and why D wanted to share the horrible contract with you. R grew up. D didn't. \n\nDid it occur to you that R might always have had feelings for S but felt shamed and afraid of showing his softer side to his cruel high school buddy? Did it occur to you that you were showing something R was probably deeply ashamed of (and didn't want his wife, who he probably cares about deeply,  married and two children later) and would never have shown S because it didn't represent his true feelings and his caring and concern for her? You have seen an awful part of his past and chosen to burden his wife with it in a way that makes it the only story about when they started to date. You have hurt them both in one of the most vulnerable ways possible. \n\nYTA, your BF is th mega-AH, R used to be an AH and might still be an AH, but you had no way of knowing for sure.", "NTA because it's not just a stupid, mean thing that ended up in a real relationship where everything is in the past. It's the fact that your partner is STILL participating in this horrible \"contract\" and her husband is still accepting the money. \n\nFor them the prank is still very much alive and you betcha I would want to know if my husband still treated our relationship as a dare. I would also be furious at everyone who kept it from me. She deserves a husband who loves her truly and honestly. It would be devastating to know the truth, but now she can take control of her life and figure out what she needs to do,\n\nI don't blame you for telling her. I applaud you. \n\nHowever, YOU have a partner problem. Why would you want to be with someone who thinks this kind of behaviour is ok? It speaks so much to his views on women. What if you gain weight? Have daughters with a weight or self-esteem issue? What is you get sick? Lose your looks? I couldn't stay with someone who is so mean. I'd never be able to look at them the same way again.", "Yikes, this is a tough one but I\u2019m going with NTA. I can see why some would say you shouldn\u2019t have told her since D clearly changed his mind about S at some point. However, this also shows a *serious* character flaw, and his previous disrespect and contempt for S could easily flare up again if they started to have any problems in their marriage. She deserves to know that this is how he saw her at least at one point, and do with that information as she chooses. Since it was high school, he might be a lot different now, but it\u2019s up to her to make that determination. Just because R thinks they\u2019re happily married doesn\u2019t mean he necessarily knows how things are when they\u2019re alone.\n\nI also would be concerned about your boyfriend\u2019s character. Once again, people do change a lot after high school, but he went along with and participated in this. Was he laughing about it or acting guilty when he revealed this to you?

Brides to be generally do not know *every* little detail of what their grooms do during the bachelor party (which traditionally not uncommonly includes exotic dancers, lots of alcohol, and other untoward temptations), so long as they don't cheat. Before there is exclusivity between a couple, one or both may be seeing multiple partners and seriously considering their choices, with some rather choice terms used with their peers while they are deliberating. There is no need to disclose all the gory details of any of these things.\n\nI believe both the mere fact that the couple has exchanged marriage vows and the mere fact that they are living together and raising children each is enough to annul the history of what your boyfriend's best friend D said and did before he became exclusive with his wife S.", "YTA.  Yeah, what they did was awful high-school stuff.  Presumably in the \\*8 years\\* since high-school they matured past that and D discovered that he genuinely cared about S.

A bit of wisdom regarding how invested they are in their relationship considering that they\u2019re married with children should have been taken into account before divulging that info.

But for her to show the wife the awful \u201ccontract\u201d is incomprehensible to me. Like how could this ever play out in a way that would be beneficial to anyone involved? If it were me, I would have sat down with both of the men and absolutely reamed them out for this shit.

Somewhere along the lines, love developed between the two.  \n\nOP learned about this shameful history and decided that she needed to blow up S's whole world.  The idea that she had the right to know is meaningless virtue signaling.  It may seem like the 'right thing' to do, but why?

I can't imagine causing that much emotional harm to people for no reason.  This secret did not need to be told.  It was best left buried in the past.  No one was currently being harmed by this, no one would be harmed by this secret in the future.  This was a bad act, but it wasn't a crime, there wasn't harm inflicted at the time or since it happened.  The only harm that could ever come from this secret is if S was told.

I wasn\u2019t friends with her but we were cordial and had mutuals (she was a really really sweet girl) so I told a close guy friend of hers that we all had class with and he said she probably knows bc it\u2019s not the first time he had been caught cheating. I didn\u2019t think it was my place because we weren\u2019t friends, so leaving that for her friend to disclose with her was my way of not feeling guilty about knowing something like that and I explained that to her and she understood. If they are friends, I do think she has a responsibility of some sort of getting that information out honestly.

I guess the difference here is that your friends had already been married with children by the time this came out but all I can say is that if I was the wife, I would want to know, even if it didn\u2019t make me happy.  I\u2019d just want to know who the person i married really is and who the people I thought were friends actually are as well.

Does he feel ashamed of himself or does he think that this kind of cruelty is only a problem if the victim finds out?

D is not necessarily of the same mindset, since he\u2019s settled and has kids.", "\"It would be unfair my boyfriend explained if D broke it off and he had to pay back double the money\"\n\nMight have fudged the wording at the end a little but but I am only going off of what OPs bf has said", "If she didn\u2019t know about it prior, it wasn\u2019t resolved. The paper was just proof of his shitty behavior. She deserves to know that her relationship is built on a complete lie. Again, if he didn\u2019t grovel over it prior to being outed, he was always in the wrong.", "They were in high school. If you think that the right thing to do is to personally disclose all details like that after marriage and kids, then do it. But OP made that decision for someone else.", "You think he married someone and has had two kids for $365 a year?", "Yeah I totally rolled with it, I like the phrase! Lol", "S is OP's friend, it says nothing about whether she has a good relationship with D. It's entirely possible she doesn't feel comfortable speaking to him one on one, and I've seen plenty of situations where someone says \"you tell them or I will\", and they end up telling their partner an altered version of events that makes op look bad instead.", "What is the point.  I'd say it was a bad way for a great thing to happen and move on. \n\nGuess OP feels good about her self but she shouldn't. \n\n\nActually I think this whole thing is made up. How many documents have you saved from highschool..seriously", "Agreed. If the only reason you\u2019re telling someone a secret is to unburden yourself, it\u2019s a very selfish reason.  Learn to live with it and not hurt an innocent person.", "If her husband is in the marriage and had kids because of the contract, and is still following it, then she is closer to being sex trafficked than she is to being in a marriage. And she deserved to know. We don't know when or if the husband ever stopped following it and just wanted to benefit off his rich friend whilst being perpetually laid. She deserved to know how her relationship started and the potential of what it can be.", "That\u2019s how I read it, too. Why else would he give his friends an anniversary gift? That\u2019s not a thing. I have no idea when my friends\u2019 anniversaries are, even if I was at their wedding. \n\nIt\u2019s also a weirdly long time to carry on a bit. Like, what was the plan here? They get married, have kids, and 20 years later D tells her he wasted years of both their lives for a joke? \n\nESH except S. While I get where you\u2019re coming from, OP, this wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone as needlessly cruel as your boyfriend, but you seem to have given him a pass for some reason. Might want to reassess that.", "I feel like people aren't getting this. The men are still using the contract. The wife is still in a dare. Why wouldn't she deserve to know? Why should anyone talk to her husband about her own feelings?", "I didn't read it that way at all-- I think OPs boyfriend thinks it's funny to continue to find ways to \"pay\" while seeming like he's just generous. I can't imagine that D is still actively and deliberately collecting on the dare.", "There are dudes who consider women basically just fuckmaids. I would be worried D is one of them. If so what difference is it if it is S who is a source of jokes and money from his rich bro, or another woman?\n\nBut that said I think OP needed to talk with her BF and D about this gross shit first to get an idea of where D was and if he felt bad for his past actions at all. \n\nAnd I do think S deserved to know.", "He showed off the contract and spent a lot on an anniversary gift as part of the dare is what I got from it though.", "He showed OP the \"contract.\" He's absolutely keeping it alive.", "yeah they could've still been joking about it to each other. grim.", "OP mentions that her bf is reasonably well off. It could just be like \"Oh hey my buddy R always gives us a real nice anniversary gift, isn't that kind of him?\" and not understanding that it's actually meant to be payment of the debt", "There's a lot of unknowns and a lot of assumptions going on there. If the husband was still actually playing along and joking about it... Ok maybe. But the person to confront them might be the husband, with a \"dude grow up\" moment. To him and the BF, who seems the one who's still going along.", "I'm gonna use that moving forward, and I'm gonna say it with such confidence that I inadvertently gaslight people into thinking it's a thing people say.\n\nWe're entering it in the vernacular starting now.\n\nFull disclosure - I'll be taking full responsibility for it when it explodes. It's not great, but what's life without a little crested drama?", ">I was torn on what to do because I always thought S and D had a happy marriage and he treated her well. But I would wanna know if my bf wrote things like that about me. I invited her out for coffee and told her everything. I had to sneak pictures of the dare contract at my bf\u2019s place. S broke down sobbing. She said she had to pretend she didn\u2019t see it because they had two children together and D has been a great father and husband.\n\nOP literally describes the relationship that S and D had though, and what kind of partner both OP and S thought D was?\n\nAgain, I'm fine dying on this hill alone, but this was not OPs to tell. It should have come from R or D, as they were the ones who were directly involved with the hurtful dare in the first place", "You're being ridiculous.  They didn't get married and have two children because he is hoping to cash in on a joke dare contract from high school.", "Dude, how old are you? No one is getting married and having two kids over a high school dare. Lmao. What. \n\nMarriage and kids cost waaaaay more than a dollar a day to maintain. The husband would be actively hemorrhaging money if this dare was his get rich quick scheme. Lmao.", "I think he did genuinely fall for her at some point, but continuing to hide the lies at the beginning is wrong. To me, at least, you never lie once. Each day that you don't own up to the truth is another lie. Each time there's an opportunity to come clean and you dont is another lie. I would be far angrier about the *years* of lying than I would the initial bet, because how can you ever trust either of them again?", "Maybe, but D needs to tell his \u201cfriend\u201d who hasn\u2019t matured beyond high school to shove his contract up his butt and return all the \u201cgifts\u201d he\u2019s accepted and end the friendship.  If D doesn\u2019t find the joke funny anymore, he needs to prove it.", "If OP is with someone whose best friend considers his wife a \"fuckmaid,\" then surely there would be indications other than the boyfriend drunkenly revealing a stupid high school joke that's probably a decade old.", "it\u2019s not really explained why exactly bf gifts the friend expensive gifts: but either way ( for the bet / for jokes), it\u2019s just so messed up? like why are grown men acting in such a way", "You're not alone. \n\nI'm not sure what Queen_Size_Beauty is on... It seems to me that they are overly concerned with what some teenagers wrote down to the point where hey are ignoring the 10+ year relationship that Op, themselves, admits was good prior to her interference.", "We don't know that, maybe he just REALLY needed the dollar.", "Yeaaaaaah. No one's ever gotten into a marriage and had children for financial benefit ever....", "I don't think it's some get rich quick scheme. I think it's possible that it's \"If I get divorced, I have to pay child support, maybe alimony, *and* pay my friend back.\"", "Agreed. I think he did actually fall for her, but I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll be able to get past the fact the entire basis of their relationship is not only a lie, but a joke. \n\nAs another commenter pointed out, it sounds like the premise of an early 2000s romcom. Popular guy is dared to date the weird girl, but truly falls for her. Chaos ensues when she finds out, but they end up together after he proves his feelings are genuine. \n\nThe main difference, of course, is the girl finds out *before* they create a life together. Not ten years and two kids later. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right. She\u2019s been lied to for the entirety of their relationship. That\u2019s not something most people (myself included) would be able to get past.", "Douches don't magically stop being douches in their 20s.", "The financial benefit of one dollar a day? You can\u2019t be serious. Do you have any idea how much kids cost? Or weddings? Or life in general?", "No. Just no. Why would he have married her in the first place. Don\u2019t tell me you really think someone got married to avoid paying a friend a couple grand on a bet that he\u2019d never really be obligated to pay.", "Yeah, I can't imagine any grown ass adult being like \"I'm going to have 2 children in order to keep up a facade that earns me $365 annually\"", "Well in the husbands case it would be a benefit of not paying double back. \n\n\nBut yes I am aware of what things cost.", "Why are you asking me what I think happened when what I said was \"I think its possible\""]}
