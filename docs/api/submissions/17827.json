Yeah how it happened sucks but you suck for hurting her many many years after the fact.", "Sheesh... I have to vote ESH - except S. I understand where you were coming from but you did the wrong thing, plain and simple.\n\nThe right thing would have been to confront your boyfriend and D and tell them that they have to admit to this whole fucked up thing and that S deserves to know the truth. That would have given D the chance to explain himself and lighten the blow. People can be assholes but he apparently changed and fell in love with the woman. He should have had the balls to admit  to his faults and come clean. But you should have had given him that chance first and not gone behind their back. That poor woman must be hurt so fucking much.\n\nFor everyone saying though that you're the only AH - Nope. Definitely your boyfriend and D are AH as well. Being young is no excuse to being this explicietly cruel and then not even having the backbone to admit to yourself being shitty.\n\nEdit: I wanna add that using this whole thing as a \"funny backstory\" is also super assholish of your boyfriend.

Question why he held onto the old contract, why D got married and had kids but your BF hasn't, and why D wanted to share the horrible contract with you. R grew up. D didn't. \n\nDid it occur to you that R might always have had feelings for S but felt shamed and afraid of showing his softer side to his cruel high school buddy? Did it occur to you that you were showing something R was probably deeply ashamed of (and didn't want his wife, who he probably cares about deeply,  married and two children later) and would never have shown S because it didn't represent his true feelings and his caring and concern for her? You have seen an awful part of his past and chosen to burden his wife with it in a way that makes it the only story about when they started to date. You have hurt them both in one of the most vulnerable ways possible. \n\nYTA, your BF is th mega-AH, R used to be an AH and might still be an AH, but you had no way of knowing for sure.", "NTA because it's not just a stupid, mean thing that ended up in a real relationship where everything is in the past. It's the fact that your partner is STILL participating in this horrible \"contract\" and her husband is still accepting the money. \n\nFor them the prank is still very much alive and you betcha I would want to know if my husband still treated our relationship as a dare. I would also be furious at everyone who kept it from me. She deserves a husband who loves her truly and honestly. It would be devastating to know the truth, but now she can take control of her life and figure out what she needs to do,\n\nI don't blame you for telling her. I applaud you. \n\nHowever, YOU have a partner problem. Why would you want to be with someone who thinks this kind of behaviour is ok? It speaks so much to his views on women.

I'd never be able to look at them the same way again.", "Yikes, this is a tough one but I\u2019m going with NTA. I can see why some would say you shouldn\u2019t have told her since D clearly changed his mind about S at some point. However, this also shows a *serious* character flaw, and his previous disrespect and contempt for S could easily flare up again if they started to have any problems in their marriage. She deserves to know that this is how he saw her at least at one point, and do with that information as she chooses. Since it was high school, he might be a lot different now, but it\u2019s up to her to make that determination. Just because R thinks they\u2019re happily married doesn\u2019t mean he necessarily knows how things are when they\u2019re alone.\n\nI also would be concerned about your boyfriend\u2019s character.

Brides to be generally do not know *every* little detail of what their grooms do during the bachelor party (which traditionally not uncommonly includes exotic dancers, lots of alcohol, and other untoward temptations), so long as they don't cheat. Before there is exclusivity between a couple, one or both may be seeing multiple partners and seriously considering their choices, with some rather choice terms used with their peers while they are deliberating. There is no need to disclose all the gory details of any of these things.\n\nI believe both the mere fact that the couple has exchanged marriage vows and the mere fact that they are living together and raising children each is enough to annul the history of what your boyfriend's best friend D said and did before he became exclusive with his wife S.", "YTA.  Yeah, what they did was awful high-school stuff.  Presumably in the \\*8 years\\* since high-school they matured past that and D discovered that he genuinely cared about S.

Do you think it's still ongoing? That would be the ONLY reason that she needed to know.\n\nAs for you, remaining with your BF after finding this out about HIM is hypocritical to the max. She needed to know what her husband did long ago because it is something that she needed to know about his character is how you seem to feel. Well, you know exactly your BFs character (same as her husband except he even keeps horrible 'dare contracts' and finds it funny and something to share with random folks who aren't involved for yucks.) Ick. Honestly, you and BF are the AHs here who just totally blew up what seems to have been a good marriage. For some laughs. Horrible.", "It wasn't something she needed to know! Her husband didn't marry her as part of the dare. He clearly realised she was awesome and he was stupid.", "They have KIDS. This isn\u2019t just about the two of them. Why couldn\u2019t you talk to D? Why couldn\u2019t he be the one to tell her?", "Who knew? You say everyone knows why. You didn't know, she didn't know, it was a long time ago. Their relationship is not your business.", "No, she didn't need to know, telling her was cruel, and how stupid they were in high school stopped being relevant long ago. Didn't you ever change your mind about anyone once you got to know them? Do you think he didn't really fall in love, and their decade together was some kind of lie? Jesus.", "You and your boyfriend knowing does not equate to everyone knowing. No, she did not need to know. If this was a new relationship, sure, the right thing to do would be to tell her. This happened when they were literal kids in school, and clearly this relationship had progressed past how it started. All telling her did was satisfy your hero complex, and cause her unnecessary pain and humiliation. And possibly tore apart a family.", "Why in gods name is he holding onto a contract for 10 years?? If it was a silly joke, why would he still have it", "Because it's implied he still sends an anniversary gift to keep \"investing\" in the contract", ">he\u2019s still talking about it, sharing pics and lapping it up behind the wife\u2019s back, laughing about it, demonstrates it\u2019s not in the past it\u2019s still going on\n\nThat's OP's boyfriend. \n\n>the fact taht he\u2019s gaslighting her blaming her for their marriage trouble instead of seeing he is directly the catalyst of cruelty and the reason this all happened\n\nThey are both assholes, but she is the one who opened her mouth to prop herself as a decent person(which she clearly isn't) and dropped all this on S, which resulted in the marriage troubles.", "The marriage was fine until she stuck her nose in. And the boyfriend is also stupid for telling her in the first place. So, whatever humor the boyfriend and his buddy were having apparently did not affect the marriage. I mean, it doesn\u2019t really make sense. The guy wifed her up and had kids with her. I doubt he\u2019s really making this an ongoing joke. Or if it is, it\u2019s harmless.", "Exactly. The husband almost certainly gave up the bet long ago. The person keeping it alive is OP's boyfriend. How do you even think to warn the wife while staying with this guy?", "That read as a joke being made to the asshole OP by the asshole boyfriend, not an ongoing payment system based on the stupid HS dare.", "Honestly, that piece of information might have moved her out of denial. Maybe she's normalized shitty behavior from her husband. \n\nPerfect on social media isn't perfect behind closed doors. If anything they need therapy. OP likely needs to lose the BF.", "If they weren\u2019t still talking about it I would 100% agree w u, but they\u2019re still laughing about it behind the wife\u2019s back, if I were that wife I would want to know and I would want it to stop which I feel like now that the secret is out, it will. If you want to leave the past in the past don\u2019t drag into the present. Can\u2019t have it both ways.", "That\u2019s a huge reach. Either way, that wasn\u2019t the OP\u2019s job. It was something that happened a long time in the past.", "We don't know that \"they're\" talking about it. We know OP's boyfriend is talking about it with other people. There's nothing here to suggest anyone else is.", "For starters, I would like to know why you think this is still going on. It sounds like stuff that all happened in high school. The bit about the anniversary gift and how the boyfriend has money, was weird. But it sounds like all of this happened a long time ago. The woman herself said that the guy has been a great husband and father. This is not the boyfriend\u2019s interpretation.\n\nOP is a meddling AH.", "He\u2019s is actively talking about it to his girlfriend, so he\u2019s gossiping and still laughing about it now, as a grown adult, he\u2019s the one who caused this mess. Hopefully now he learned his lesson.", "No the boyfriend brought up the story recently which is the main issue if he had kept his mouth shut there would be no issue but he had to be an AH and laugh about it which means he\u2019s not much more mature than a teenager, so it\u2019s all entirely his fault this even happened.", "Yes, I think everyone agrees that OP's boyfriend is in the wrong. There's no indication that the husband is hanging on to this high school bet, which was OP's justification for blowing up their marriage."]}
