If you had concerns you should have had a conversation with her husband about it. It really doesn\u2019t sound like the \u201cdare\u201d is why he married and has two children with this woman. Yeah how it happened sucks but you suck for hurting her many many years after the fact.", "Sheesh... I have to vote ESH - except S. I understand where you were coming from but you did the wrong thing, plain and simple.\n\nThe right thing would have been to confront your boyfriend and D and tell them that they have to admit to this whole fucked up thing and that S deserves to know the truth. That would have given D the chance to explain himself and lighten the blow. People can be assholes but he apparently changed and fell in love with the woman. He should have had the balls to admit  to his faults and come clean. But you should have had given him that chance first and not gone behind their back. That poor woman must be hurt so fucking much.\n\nFor everyone saying though that you're the only AH - Nope. Definitely your boyfriend and D are AH as well. Being young is no excuse to being this explicietly cruel and then not even having the backbone to admit to yourself being shitty.\n\nEdit: I wanna add that using this whole thing as a \"funny backstory\" is also super assholish of your boyfriend.

Question why he held onto the old contract, why D got married and had kids but your BF hasn't, and why D wanted to share the horrible contract with you. R grew up. D didn't. \n\nDid it occur to you that R might always have had feelings for S but felt shamed and afraid of showing his softer side to his cruel high school buddy? Did it occur to you that you were showing something R was probably deeply ashamed of (and didn't want his wife, who he probably cares about deeply,  married and two children later) and would never have shown S because it didn't represent his true feelings and his caring and concern for her? You have seen an awful part of his past and chosen to burden his wife with it in a way that makes it the only story about when they started to date. You have hurt them both in one of the most vulnerable ways possible. \n\nYTA, your BF is th mega-AH, R used to be an AH and might still be an AH, but you had no way of knowing for sure.", "NTA because it's not just a stupid, mean thing that ended up in a real relationship where everything is in the past. It's the fact that your partner is STILL participating in this horrible \"contract\" and her husband is still accepting the money. \n\nFor them the prank is still very much alive and you betcha I would want to know if my husband still treated our relationship as a dare. I would also be furious at everyone who kept it from me. She deserves a husband who loves her truly and honestly. It would be devastating to know the truth, but now she can take control of her life and figure out what she needs to do,\n\nI don't blame you for telling her. I applaud you. \n\nHowever, YOU have a partner problem. Why would you want to be with someone who thinks this kind of behaviour is ok? It speaks so much to his views on women. What if you gain weight? Have daughters with a weight or self-esteem issue? What is you get sick? Lose your looks? I couldn't stay with someone who is so mean. I'd never be able to look at them the same way again.", "Yikes, this is a tough one but I\u2019m going with NTA. I can see why some would say you shouldn\u2019t have told her since D clearly changed his mind about S at some point. However, this also shows a *serious* character flaw, and his previous disrespect and contempt for S could easily flare up again if they started to have any problems in their marriage. She deserves to know that this is how he saw her at least at one point, and do with that information as she chooses. Since it was high school, he might be a lot different now, but it\u2019s up to her to make that determination. Just because R thinks they\u2019re happily married doesn\u2019t mean he necessarily knows how things are when they\u2019re alone.\n\nI also would be concerned about your boyfriend\u2019s character.

Brides to be generally do not know *every* little detail of what their grooms do during the bachelor party (which traditionally not uncommonly includes exotic dancers, lots of alcohol, and other untoward temptations), so long as they don't cheat. Before there is exclusivity between a couple, one or both may be seeing multiple partners and seriously considering their choices, with some rather choice terms used with their peers while they are deliberating. There is no need to disclose all the gory details of any of these things.\n\nI believe both the mere fact that the couple has exchanged marriage vows and the mere fact that they are living together and raising children each is enough to annul the history of what your boyfriend's best friend D said and did before he became exclusive with his wife S.", "YTA.  Yeah, what they did was awful high-school stuff.  Presumably in the \\*8 years\\* since high-school they matured past that and D discovered that he genuinely cared about S.

Her husband made a mistake, but obviously, he's over it now, but you were not satisfied and convinced yourself you're doing her a favor.  No, you are not.

OP going to S directly ensures that the maximum amount of hurt is going to be felt by everyone in the situation, and is the most tactless way to go about this.

I wasn\u2019t friends with her but we were cordial and had mutuals (she was a really really sweet girl) so I told a close guy friend of hers that we all had class with and he said she probably knows bc it\u2019s not the first time he had been caught cheating. I didn\u2019t think it was my place because we weren\u2019t friends, so leaving that for her friend to disclose with her was my way of not feeling guilty about knowing something like that and I explained that to her and she understood.

I guess the difference here is that your friends had already been married with children by the time this came out but all I can say is that if I was the wife, I would want to know, even if it didn\u2019t make me happy.  I\u2019d just want to know who the person i married really is and who the people I thought were friends actually are as well.

It\u2019s certainly *not* funny, and I\u2019d want to know why my husband is accepting such a large sum. If I\u2019m not rich as shit, a yearly large sum of money from a friend is beyond bizarre and I would have questions.", "For me it was the fact that bringing up the gift led to him talking about the old dare so there must be some type of relevance", "Idk. How often do you buy a friend an anniversary gift??  It\u2019s not standard or common.  If he\u2019s spending at least $365 and the husband hasn\u2019t put a stop to it, there is an issue.", "People always suggest this cop-out and it's pretty much always a bad idea. This is just giving them the chance to try to undermine your credibility or sort out their lies ahead of time and a confession leveraged through an ultimatum is worthless anyway because if they actually felt the appropriate amount of remorse they would have come clean when it happened.", "Okay but you understand that that isn't your decision to make for someone else right? If they truly believe it's not important than it won't ruin their marriage and if it is so important that it ruins their marriage then you did the right thing regardless.

The key pillars of love are trust and respect in my opinion, and for her husband to talk to her like that shows he didn\u2019t respect her.", "I think that just makes him a more immature AH. D is not necessarily of the same mindset, since he\u2019s settled and has kids.", "\"It would be unfair my boyfriend explained if D broke it off and he had to pay back double the money\"\n\nMight have fudged the wording at the end a little but but I am only going off of what OPs bf has said", "If she didn\u2019t know about it prior, it wasn\u2019t resolved. The paper was just proof of his shitty behavior. She deserves to know that her relationship is built on a complete lie. Again, if he didn\u2019t grovel over it prior to being outed, he was always in the wrong.", "They were in high school. If you think that the right thing to do is to personally disclose all details like that after marriage and kids, then do it.

Lol", "S is OP's friend, it says nothing about whether she has a good relationship with D. It's entirely possible she doesn't feel comfortable speaking to him one on one, and I've seen plenty of situations where someone says \"you tell them or I will\", and they end up telling their partner an altered version of events that makes op look bad instead.", "What is the point.  I'd say it was a bad way for a great thing to happen and move on. \n\nGuess OP feels good about her self but she shouldn't. \n\n\nActually I think this whole thing is made up.

She deserved to know how her relationship started and the potential of what it can be.", "That\u2019s how I read it, too. Why else would he give his friends an anniversary gift? That\u2019s not a thing. I have no idea when my friends\u2019 anniversaries are, even if I was at their wedding. \n\nIt\u2019s also a weirdly long time to carry on a bit.

While I get where you\u2019re coming from, OP, this wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it.

Why should anyone talk to her husband about her own feelings?", "I didn't read it that way at all-- I think OPs boyfriend thinks it's funny to continue to find ways to \"pay\" while seeming like he's just generous. I can't imagine that D is still actively and deliberately collecting on the dare.", "There are dudes who consider women basically just fuckmaids. I would be worried D is one of them. If so what difference is it if it is S who is a source of jokes and money from his rich bro, or another woman?\n\nBut that said I think OP needed to talk with her BF and D about this gross shit first to get an idea of where D was and if he felt bad for his past actions at all. \n\nAnd I do think S deserved to know.", "He showed off the contract and spent a lot on an anniversary gift as part of the dare is what I got from it though.", "He showed OP the \"contract.\" He's absolutely keeping it alive.", "yeah they could've still been joking about it to each other. grim.", "OP mentions that her bf is reasonably well off.

Each day that you don't own up to the truth is another lie. Each time there's an opportunity to come clean and you dont is another lie.

D *might* get a pass as he seems to truly care about S and I\u2019ll bet has never once tried to cash in on the dare from your bf. Your Bf is the one that is still keeping the contract joke alive. Even your bf might get only a slight YTA, if he acknowledged that he and D were horrible people in the past and have grown from it, and the gift is really a nod to how their dumb mistake created something beautiful. I would also want to know who initiated all the cruel language against S in the contract - possibly it was your BF but D just went along with it, and actually secretly liked S. \n\nYTA because you could\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of the dare between D and your bf to know whether or not they still hold those misogynistic thoughts towards S, yourself, and women in general in their lives. While the language is not great, on the surface it seems like D has matured and has been an amazing  partner to S. If there was still evidence that S and R are still immature jerks, then maybe you had some grounds to tip off S, but I wouldn\u2019t have gone into specifics either.

The reason I say that is because what\u2019s done is done.  This is something that should\u2019ve been outed wayyyyyyy back when they were dating in the beginning if it was going to be outed, not after a wedding has taken place and not after they have two kids together.  In my opinion, no grown man is going to marry a woman on a stupid dare, so what started off as a dare turned into a real romance and real love between them, because he married her and had two kids with her.  I have also dated people I thought were very attractive until I got to know them and then no amount of looks would keep me around their awful behavior and personality, and on the flip side I\u2019ve dated a guy who, when I first met him, I found him extremely unattractive physically and when I got to know him, those feeling changed and I was very attracted to him after getting know him.  It sounds to me like some stupid high school or college boys being immature jerks years ago and now you\u2019re holding an adult man, who most likely deeply regrets his actions, accountable for something he did years ago that would\u2019ve hurt nobody had you not opened your mouth.  Your boyfriend is also an AH for even bringing it up.  He should\u2019ve taken that to the grave because he was supposed to be best friends with D.  R should\u2019ve by now realized and been intelligent enough to understand that what D did was the biggest mistake and deepest regret of his life, burned the \u201ccontract\u201d (major eye roll here.  Why would anyone keep that?) not kept it all these years.  That is so immature and such an AH move.  Not only did you cause a problem for S and D, you most like ended the friendship between R and D.  You and R sound like you deserve each other.", "YTA you knew exactly what you were doing. You knew that would destroy her.

I don\u2019t even remember his name anymore, but the story is relevant. \n\nI was 15, about to be 16. Had just broken up with my first boyfriend and was at a restaurant. I felt like I kind of looked like garbage, but you know. It was teenage garbage. This *super cute* server caught me as I was walking out and slipped me his number. Cell phones didn\u2019t exist yet lol this was the late 90s. \n\nI did call him. He started calling me a lot, we had a beach date, he had a car and was about to graduate, and he was like the hottest guy I\u2019d ever seen. He went to school a couple towns over.\n\nHe called me from work one day after school. He worked at that restaurant but he also worked at a store. He was at the store that day and he asked me to hold on. I guess he thought he put me on hold but he didn\u2019t. His friend was asking him about the girl from the restaurant (me) and if he hit it yet (no, and it took me a minute to understand what he meant). There was a dare and a wager. He had been dared to ask me out and there was money on the line about whether he could fuck me. He said he was working on it and that I was on the phone right then. The way they fucking laughed. \n\nSo fast forward to today. It\u2019s been a long time and I haven\u2019t thought about this in a while. But I read this and it made me stop.

I never would have known if he hadn\u2019t not muted the phone. \n\nAnd it is mean spirited. I could argue that maybe forgiveness is warranted - they were kids, teenagers generally suck.

Besides, it's really easy to say \"I'd want to know\" when you believe there's nothing to know. At the very least, you should first confirm whether it's still ongoing for the husband(which seems ridiculously unlikely), then check whether the wife would hypothetically want to know. As it stands though, there's absolutely nothing to be gained from telling her. Nobody can change what happened, it's been a decade, the guy likely regrets it and genuinely loves her.

She couldn't do that before.  You did her a harsh favor.\n\nYour BF is mad because he can't feel superior to S now by holding the secret over her head.  And that the long delayed consequences of his terrible attitude and the pain such pranks always cause came back to bite him and his friend.", "Info. Why are you still dating your bf if the contract was \u201cthe most disgusting thing I saw\u201d ? He\u2019s 27 and still talking about it. Still paying into it! Which is worse!  And yet you\u2019re still dating him! Why?", "NTA.\n\nYour bf and D are the jerks here. I'd be so wary with all of them. If they went that far to 'enforce' a 'contract' as a type of their 'secret joke,' Id also be wonder what else they're doing behind the partners' back.\n\nI hope S will be fine. I think you did the right thing to let her know that her husband had that sick joke going for years. Yes, I doubt that he married her due to a contract, but at the very least, now she's aware and with eyes wide open in re: her husband as a person.", "NTA. I'd want to know if my partner had ever spoken about me like this. The only AH here is the two men.", "This is tricky. NTA. It would be different if it was just a stupid thing from high school long passed- but he still has the contract, they still talk about it, and regardless of whether he turned out to have true feelings for her, context clues say your husband bought such an expensive gift *because* of this contract. \n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made a family disingenuously because of some high school dare. However, if he really respected his wife he would\u2019ve shut this contract shit down. \n\nIf I was her I\u2019d want to know about a cruel joke that had been played on me if it was *still going on*.", "The fact alone that he still has the fucking contract should blow whistles for everyone here, no OP is not the AH, obviously only those two are. Why would you not shred, burn, whatever such a thing, why keep it like some sort of gross trophy.", "NTA. You did what you would have wanted someone to do for you if you were in her situation. And that's the most anyone can ask for. \n\nThe fallout isn't your fault. It's on them. It was a shitty prank and the awful things they said about S. S  now gets to decide what to do with their information. And maybe she would have rather hqve never know but you can't have known that. You tried you best and screw your bf for making you feel like shit about it honestly. To me this is a firm NTA", "They \u201chad\u201d been immature children but he still had the \u201ccontract\u201d???", "This is really tough but I think I'm gonna go NTA. Maybe you are a tiny bit of an a-hole for how you handled it, but I know that I would want to know. Yeah, they obviously (or at least I fucking hope so) did actually fall in love, but if my entire relationship and marriage was built off of some dare, I would be pretty fucking mad and want to know too. D should've told S LOOOONG before they were married about the situation. She mightve been upset and angry at first but if they were in love they would've figured it out. I'm not sure what you thought would happen when you told S... I don't know what I would've done in this situation. Either way, you did what you felt was right, so I dont think your the asshole here", "NTA for telling her, that was definitely the right call as nothing would have been accomplished by talking to the men to try get them to tell S themselves. they could have warped the truth or lied or just straight up not done it. and S deserves to know. \n\nHowever, YTA for staying with your disgusting boyfriend who still laughs at S to this day and still engages in this gross contract. the fact that he still finds it funny shows he has not matured past his teenage misogyny as so many comments are suggesting. you staying with him is essentially telling him that you think this is ok, and I do not doubt that it will come back to bite you in the end", "NTA, she deserved to know and you were the only person who would\u2019ve told her. The issue isn\u2019t that it started out as a dare but that it seems to be continuing even now. If I found out my husband went out with me initially as a dare, I would be hurt, but if I found out it was still happening, I would be furious. Are you really okay with staying with your bf now that you know about this dare/bet he had with his friend, though? They are equally gross for it.", "NTA, you did the right thing. D had plenty of opportunities to come clean and let S decide for herself if she wanted to stay with him: when the relationship first became serious, before they were married, before they had children together.\n\nI don\u2019t understand the people saying you just wanted to cause drama. Imo you treated S with more respect than her husband has for their entire relationship. She can make INFORMED decisions now. If their \u201chappy\u201d marriage is ruined by her knowing this information, that just confirms that she should have had it sooner.", "NTA She should absolutely know what kind of cruel person she is with, and you were being a good friend. Your boyfriend and D are absolutely disgusting, and it\u2019s vile that this contract is still going. You and S should both be rethinking your relationships.", "NTA\n\ndownvote the hell out of me if you must. But two children, so if they have a son they would be cool with him doing this? how about a daughter? Would someone doing this to her make her parents feel great because after all it worked for them. Now flip the sexes, daughter does this to a partner or son has it done to him. Are we still ok?\n\nand is the gift he got payment on the contract?\n\nOP you are an AH to yourself because your bf KEPT THE CONTRACT and laughs about it. They are 8-10 years out from this contract and it\u2019s still a joke to them\u2026 I think you need your running shoes on.\n\nS deserves to know because her Relationship was founded on lies and that needs some engineering to fix, assuming it can be. Maybe her husband doesn\u2019t laugh about the contract anymore so he actually had growth but the fact he omitted it tells me something. i have four kids and this info would shatter my marriage because It meant I couldn\u2019t trust my husband.\n\nin all the movies where they date on a dare, the truth comes out in HS and they move past It together, unrealistically in many cases. but Like we aren\u2019t in a movie, this is RL and that shit is fucked up.", "YTA. However they started dating, D liked S enough to marry her. Your actions were spiteful and destructive.", "ESH. I would like to know if the man I married only started dating me as a joke or dare. A relationship built on a lie is not a true relationship.", "NTA because even though they have a happy marriage now , she still deserves to know the truth. It\u2019s similar to when someone does something in the relationship and says it\u2019s best to keep it a secret from their partner because if they knew it would cause a problem. Despite the time this contract happened, it still was something that occurred and she was disrespected and was in a relationship based on a lie", "YTA. How did it help her to know this? She already has kids with him. He was treating her well and they had a happy marriage. People do dumb things when they\u2019re younger.", "NTA. D is such a disgusting person it makes me sick. Your bf too. If that contract didn't mean something to your bf he wouldn't have held onto it for all these years, especially once his friend and S got married. S deserves to know the kind of man she married, and that one of her husband's friends still reminisces about that contract so much he keeps it around.", "YTA. You aren't looking out for S. You are looking out for yourself. You wanted to know if your sh*tty bf was dating you for a dare too. You used S just like your bf and her husband used her laughs. You didn't think about her feeling or the consequences of your actions. You are definitely the a**hole here.", "ESH except S, obviously. Your boyfriend should never have shown you that contract, or thought that the disgusting things he and the other boys called S would be FUNNY to you, and obviously D beginning an entire relationship with someone he thought so little of was unspeakably cruel.\n\nObviously, those two are major assholes, and it seems like your heart was in the right place here. But that being said, I think showing her the contract outright was the wrong move for all the anguish it caused her. She DOES deserve to know if her relationship is a sham, but given all the time that's passed, it sounds like D does have some genuine feelings for her now. That isn't to excuse what he did, and I'm not going to speculate on how good their marriage actually is or whether he truly respects her or not, but I think, if anything, you should have confronted him about it and tried to get a better feel for the relationship before dropping that bomb on her \n\nHowever this ends for them, D definitely made his own bed with this one, but S did not deserve to have the rug pulled out from under her in such a way.", "This is so confusing to keep track of using letters instead of fake names", "YTA  Why would you do that!!!!!!   That was just so unbelievably cruel.  It was a stupid joke those guys did when they were young and immature.  He probably really liked her before he even asked her out and your boyfriend probably made this idiotic contract up to get him to do it.  There is a marriage with two innocent kids at stake here.  Geez!\n\nMy mother had a cousin who said that the sight of the boy next door made her want to throw up.  She secretly had a crush on him but didn't want others to know it.  They were married nearly 50 years when he died.", "I think YTA\n\nThe bet between them is vile, of course, but it was kids and it seems clear that at some point he fell in love with S. But you still chose to tell her something that you had to know would always be in her mind now and could very well ruin that relationship.\n\nThe guys are bad for what they did a long time ago, but I think you should have gotten more information, thought more about what you were affecting, and all that.", "NTA. She deserves to know. The only thing you did wrong was telling her in a public place. He probably fell in love with her after maturing and realizing that she is a human being with feelings and not just an object. Her marriage started in the most disgusting way, and your boyfriend helped with that. The contract must still matter if he bought them an expensive anniversary gift, made a joke as a way to cope with the amount of money he felt forced to spend, and then drunkenly admitted it to you. If you don\u2019t leave your boyfriend after this, then I\u2019d say you\u2019re just as bad as them.", "Yes! And did they grow up and fall in love and have kids or did they get pregnant and decided to build a life together or something in between.", "It's gotta. Who buys another couple a wedding anniversary gift. I've never gotten a single friend an anniversary gift for their wedding.", "Help them complete their real life *Taming of the Shrew*?", "Also it sounds like S had known something was off with their relationship anyway, given her own reaction. So, all OP has done is confirm it for her. The real arseholes are OPs boyfriend and S's husband. What OP needs to do is leave OP because who the hell wants to stay with someone who still thinks this is funny and okay, and support S as a good friend, not an extension of \"i know you through this guy\". She's put the cats amongst the pigeons and unfortunately even though she's done nothing wrong, she is involved now and needs to help sort the mess out.\n\nNTA", "Yep, the bf is giving HUGE red flags. What he does to others behind their backs is what he will do to you. Aka shit talking and making shitty comments.", "Strongly disagree with ths.  S had the right to know the truth.  She's making decisions that affect her entire future, such as having children, and D is too chickenshit to give her the information she needs to make empowered decisions, so someone has to do it.\n\nThe news probably crushed S's heart, but it also empowered her.  She now knows what her husband is.  It will allow her to choose her future in a way she absolutely cannot do while the wool is still firmly over her eyes.\n\nNot all pain is bad.  This pain brought with it liberation, the freedom to make informed choices in her relationship for the first time, and that's a powerful gift.  OP is NTA.", "Right? Let\u2019s say OP never said anything and S finds out years down the road that every time she was in a room with her three \u201cfriends,\u201d they all knew and had joked about this secret but never had the decency to tell her. It would also be a betrayal of friendship, not just the marriage. \n\nIt also speaks volumes that OP\u2019s bf just expected her to go along with the lie and to betray her own friend, seemingly indefinitely. OP, if you\u2019re reading this, please see this as the MAJOR red flag that it is. Your bf does not sound like a man of character and integrity.", "This!!!! I also don't think op was wrong in telling her friend. But if her bf was a good guy he would feel so ashamed about what he did. the fact that he still jokes with it shows he don't regret and he don't feel bad at all with being cruel to his friend's wife. I mean, she is not a random girl of his HS anymore with whom he had no relation. She is someone he must KNOW by this point, someone whose house he might go often and meet often, so the fact he still doesn't mind making a joke out of her is extra disgusting. If op continues with him knowing all of this..... well, it takes a lot of gut.", "Confused by all the \u201cNot The AH\u201d votes saying \u201cyou should have told D to come clean to S\u201d like yes let\u2019s tell the manipulator to be responsible & come clean to their victim & expect them to do so from a caring & gentle way.\n\nYeah no, OP is NOT an ass & I\u2019m shocked", "The bet ruined the relationship and bringing in someone else on it to, what, laugh about it? Don\u2019t kid yourself.", "Is this sarcastic?", "Honestly I agree with you, someone had to tell her and I think op is NTA", "If I were in this exact situation, no, I would not be mad. I would rather be left in the dark from something that took place 10 years ago.", "It\u2019s not about the dare. D could have come clean later on. I think it\u2019s really wrong that he didn\u2019t tell S the truth after they got serious.", "OP did not want to do the right thing. OP wanted to know if her BF had done the same to her. So she blew up another woman\u2019s life in the process.", "I wouldn't! This was at least 8 years ago (26-18), possibly longer. I don't want to know everything my partner says about me right now let alone 8 years ago. \n\nHigh school boys tend to be assholes, but most of them outgrow it. They say things they don't mean, especially with other male friends.", "The lengths men will go to to blame anyone else but themselves for their horrible actions never ceases to amaze me.", "THANK YOU I was looking for this! \n\nEarth to OP: YOUR boyfriend was the other half of this gross teenage bullshit. Were you just wanting your friend to feel the same pain you did on realizing that your boyfriend was a Grade-A Asshole in high school? \n\nI know misery loves company, but it wasn't your story to tell. If you absolutely HAD to stir the pot the thing to do would be to tell your boyfriend that you weren't comfortable carrying that secret and informing him that you would tell S by X date. \n\nAnd to everyone self righteously announcing that they would want to know: ask yourselves if you would want your partner to read a transcript of your terrible decisions/conversations in high school.", "R still has the physical contract from high school.", "Yeah it\u2019s disgusting really. I was almost doubting myself until I realized by some other comments that the bet is STILL ongoing, so clearly neither R nor D feels too bad about it. It\u2019s just a big inside joke to them. S deserved to know, and OP should break up with R since he obviously hasn\u2019t changed that much. Not a trustworthy person.", "Does it actually say that D is still enforcing the contract? Maybe he did tell R to throw it away years ago but R turned it into an anniversary present instead.", "Ya and they keep saying it was a happy marriage but is it? If it started from a dare I am sure D might not actually value his partner and may cheat on her if his mentality is that he\u2019s better than her and him dating her started as a joke.", "I can only state my opinion here; I'd like to know, no matter how miserable the truth might be.\nGuy , obviously, had no intention in coming clean.\nI mean, I don't understand the whole deal. He dates her as a joke, makes fun of her, marries her and has 2 kids with her.\nLike, wtf...when will the \" joke\" end? When they are both 80 something...\n\nHonestly, that guy should have married his manipulative mate. They'd make a perfect pair.", "Flippant.", "Not necessarily the husband. We have no idea how the husband feels about the cruel \"joke\" NOW. Her bf is a sad sack though.", "I think he married her for the reason most men marry : she was there and she agreed to it.", ">Right I\u2019m super confused on ppl saying she\u2019s the ah like I would want to know, who\u2019s to say D didn\u2019t just continue to be with her because he couldn\u2019t find anyone else? \n\nBecause no one who doesn't live in a sitcom would ever do that. Literally never.", "It's pretty heavily implied that the dare was the reason for the extravagant gift, meaning it *is* still going on.", "Her bf is the one holding onto it. Talking about it to others, holding into a high school piece of paper, and gifting them something as a continued joke. Hes the one thats currently the most f*cked up in my opinion. I bet D wishes his rich buddy would move the fuck on and likely regrets that that's how he started his life with the mother of his children.", "Yep. Fruit of the poisonous tree, as they say. I bet S is reevaluating the last 10 years based on this revelation. There may be other things she overlooked that she\u2019s starting to see (or is *willing* to see), now that the wool has been pulled over her eyes. \n\nNTA.", "At some point, when D realized he had something good with S he should\u2019ve gave the money back and tore up the contract. It\u2019s shady that R held onto the contract all these years and is either holding it over D or it\u2019s an ongoing inside \u201cjoke\u201d. D should have come clean a LONG time ago. The cruel words and jokes on it was awful too. Money being exchanged makes the marriage seem I dunno, fraudulent?! \n\nCould they really have had a happy marriage when it was based on a lie? A happy marriage based on key information they hoped S would never find out? Happy marriages don\u2019t have this level of deception in it.", "Yes. Having been cheated on and everyone around me knew and having to find out myself the hard way, I absolutely 100% would tattle on the cheater. I had a coworker debating whether they should tell their friend that her husband was sleeping with one of the bridesmaids from their wedding. I said if she\u2019s your friend, you should tell her. Then I was told by my other coworker that since I\u2019m not married I don\u2019t know what married life is like so should stay out of it. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my SO for over 22 years. We have a house together. The only difference between my relationship and theirs is I\u2019ve known my SO a LOT longer, been with them for almost as long as they\u2019ve been alive, and don\u2019t have a piece of paper certifying our relationship. But I don\u2019t really understand relationship dynamics because I\u2019m not married. /s", "Exactly. A deserves a life partner who treats her with love & respect. The \u201cjoke\u201d would probably just end when D meets a woman he wants. He\u2019d most certainly cheat on her down the line. S needs to get out of there ASAP", "If it was a girl he actually liked, why did the contract refer to her as \"Skinny Piggy\"?", "Sheesh", "Here\u2019s the thing. I have found out recently, that the husband of a friend of mine from college kissed another girl, while they were still together, when he was away during his study abroad. Thing is, this was  about 13 years ago at this point, most of the people in our friend group know about this, and have all kept it from her. They now have been married for 10 years, and have three kids together. She struggled with fertility issues and he was her rock during that time. They have a beautiful family together and seem to have an amazing life together. \n\nWhen I asked others why they never told her, they said it was because it was a drunken mistake he made over 10 years ago, he showed severe remorse immediately after, and it would only serve to hurt her, so they never told her. I see where they are coming from, and I can\u2019t help but agree. It is actively eating me up inside to keep this from her, but I feel that telling her would only be passing the buck to relieve my feeling of guilt of knowing this, and potentially cause huge problems in their lives. From what I\u2019ve been able to find out, he\u2019s never done anything like this before or since that one incident.", "I think the general agreement in the comments is that he genuinely seemed to have fallen in love with S, but the *dispute* is why even still have the contract. It says some pretty awful things about S, after all. \n\nPossibility 1 - he doesn't realize R still has the contract and refers to it, apparently, when buying gifts (if that is why the contract was brought up to begin with, to justify the price of the gift)\n\nPossibility 2 - he does know and is fine with his *wife* being remembered as \"skinny piggy\" and whatever else they wrote into it. \n\nIf I were OP, I'd tell D what has been revealed and drop R as a bf, because either possibility has R being complicit in carrying out the terms and still amused *to this day* about the awful things said about S. If he wasn't, why keep the contract at all? Throw it out or burn it.", "Tbh, I can't imagine still going out with R after he revealed this \"joke\".", "Right? Why do they even still have the contract or entertain any of it like it\u2019s a joke.\n\nD should have told his friend to rip the contract up and never speak of it again. He loves his wife and the dare was cruel and immature. \n\nWtf the contract is still even in existence for anyone to see is beyond me.", ">If my SO had called me things like that in the past and was hiding it from me, I don\u2019t care when it happened or what has happened since, I\u2019d want to know. That\u2019s disgusting and incredibly misogynistic behavior.\n\nYeah - I'm surprised why OP is still with her BF who was in on the joke and kept the contract.", "Exactly. I would want to know and OP says that S knew about it already. Sure S was acting vacant and different but that\u2019s not on OP. That\u2019s on D. \n\nOP is NTA\u2026R + D are for having this go on so long especially after them getting married and then kids coming into the question.", "Is it the husband, because I got the impression the only one that hadn\u2019t moved on was the BF? He\u2019s very clearly the biggest red flag, (unless the husband did in fact go through with a wedding and kids, which is in fact serial killer level).", "That doesn\u2019t matter to me I would still wanna know that my husband thought it was an acceptable \u201cjoke\u201d to participate in, to me D\u2019s character is in question that he would go along with calling me a bitch, piggy, and dating me for money. Maybe that\u2019s just me but I\u2019m not absolving D of anything just because she didn\u2019t hear it from him", "It\u2019s weird how so many Redditors are against the \u201cboys will be boys\u201d mentality, yet they\u2019re advocating for it in this exact post.", "Fingers crossed for that lady.", "So figure out your options including talking to the husband and/or figuring out of your friend falls in the \u201cwant to know\u201d or \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to know\u201d category. Ultimately, husband should be the one to tell the wife of his lapse in judgment and loyalty to his wife and vows.\n\nI can only speak to me: I don\u2019t care how remorseful my spouse is/was, we both know that that type of breach of trust is a deal breaker. It would be even more so if it had been actively hidden from me (or him) for years. It should be *my* choice whether I choose to end the relationship or try to rebuild the broken trust. But my husband (and every \u201cfriend\u201d that knew) effectively took my decision-making ability away from me. I don\u2019t like having my independence or autonomy taken away without my consent or knowledge. But that\u2019s just me.", "right? people can be shitty when they\u2019re young but this is a different level, honestly. i would view my partner differently if i found out he participated in something like this.", "This is what I can't get over. It's not even clear from this if D was the one saying bad things about S, clearly he liked her enough to marry her and have two kids with her.\n\nIt's R who's the AH for keeping that paper and showing the OP... for what reason? Because he thought it was \"funny\"?\n\nThe OP is clearly focusing on D and S's relationship and avoiding questioning that maybe she shouldn't be with this guy who, despite being a few years older than her, clearly has some maturity issues if he's still living in high school.", "No, he only has to pay it back if *he* breaks up with her. If she 'gets the hint' and breaks up with him, he's in the clear.", "My question is... WHY ON EARTH DID R still even have the contract?\n\nI genuinely think D fell in love with S, so surely the minute that happened, they should have chucked / burnt the damn thing!!", "Yeah hilarious joke. You married a woman you dated on a dare and we laugh out asses off about it on your anniversary every year.", "If I were S it would be hard for me to ever trust that a partner was being genuine ever again.  This is psychological damage.", "I don't know if OP was wrong for telling S the truth, but the fact that she's still dating her boyfriend - who apparently thinks this contract is humorous enough to continue making jokes about - really doesn't sit well with me. I know that Reddit jumps to \"dump him\" too quickly, but if I were in S's shoes, I would feel so horribly, horribly betrayed by all three of these people. Her marriage is built on a lie instigated by her husband's best friend, and OP, someone who she thought was her friend, continues to play nice with a guy who was *just recently* teeheeing over his mistreatment of her. I just feel so incredibly heartbroken for this poor woman.", "ok so it absolutely should not have come from OP but you're suggesting telling D that if he doesn't fess up to his wife about it then OP will? which is it?", "it's been presumably more than just 1 year. so $365 \u00d7 however many years since he asked her out", "That's not what the comment is saying though? The comment is saying literally everyone sucks, including both partners. It's just also pointing out how harmful it was to have OP be the person delivering the message instead of the people who were the original assholes", "OP is fine destroying a marriage with children but it's too inconvenient to break up with her bf. And the way she talks about this guy being so kind to her...", "This is what I was wondering. There is no indication that the husband is still referencing the contract, making jokes, etc. That's all OPs boyfriend. Husband could have told him off years ago about it, and boyfriend still does it as a joke without husbands knowledge. This would make all the difference to me in deciding to tell the wife or not.", "This is speculation regarding OP's motivation.\n\nPersonally, I would tell my friend because I believed in her right to information pertinent to her relationship, and I would feel betrayed by anybody who didn't tell me.\n\nTo me, it sounds like a lot of people do not want to approach difficult conversations for selfish reasons, and so they take the cowardly route of omitting them.\n\nThe problem is that you lose out on engaging more truly with your friends, and you will always lack the closeness this could have brought.\n\nI don't mean that everyone has to depose everything all the time, but I absolutely do think the husband should have told his wife, certainly before she became pregnant with his child. Now she feels traumatized, stuck, and unable to speak with her partner. I hope he knows he doesn't deserve her.", "Let me be absolutely clear.  The people who did the damage were D and the BF.  They bear 100% responsibility for their own attitude, the \"prank\" and any damage that was done.  The fact that the BF is still honoring the terms of this horrible high school mean girl \"contract\" says everything and it's absolutely disgusting.\n\nIn that situation S absolutely needs to know so that she can make informed decisions about what kind of man she's with and whether she can deal with D knowing who he is.  She has the right to get to make that decision, and knowing the truth gave her the privilege of making it.\n\nIf they can move past it, or they can't, entirely depends on how much D has grown in the relationship.  Personally considering he was still in cahoots with the BF (who looks the worst of anyone in all this and I hope is a STBXBF) I'm not that optimistic.  \n\nEither way, S deserves to be a knowing participant in what comes next, not the butt of a joke or the victim of a cruel prank.  OP did that for her.", "Also, isn't it $3650 by now? A dollar a day for ten years since high school?\nThat's why the boyfriend (in his drunken rambles) said he's broke after buying D an anniversary gift, right?", "He probably gives them a gift every year.", "I don't even believe S's husband dated her on a dare - I bet he secretly liked her but OP's husband was the dominant personality in the friendship and made him feel ashamed about it.", "So if her husband stopped joking about it, the wife doesn\u2019t deserve to know that her life is built on a lie and the man she loves and trusts used to say vile, cruel, misogynistic things about her? If he had been cheating but then stopped cheating, would you say the same thing?"]}
