She offered to take me out for dinner and planned other activities for us as well. Jenny told me that her mother Shannon (53 F) wanted to see me and also express her condolences as well but I was adamant beforehand that I did not want to meet her. Shannon and my mother never got along due to her treatment towards me. Shannon constantly made snarky remarks to my younger self. When Jenny and I were 14 we ultimately stopped being friends due to Shannon. Jenny had invited me over to her birthday party and at the time my mother did not have enough money to get Jenny a gift. This caused Shannon to become extremely upset and refused to allow me to eat any of the food at the party. She specifically told me that I 'did not bring anything to the table, and was not allowed to eat what she and others had purchased'. I called my mother who berated Shannon for her treatment towards me and left. Upon showing up to our dinner plans, Jenny's mother, Shannon (53 F) unbeknownst to me, was also invited to this outing. While I was upset I decided to not 'cause a scene'  and instead decided to stay and enjoy myself for once in a while. However when Shannon arrived her main focus was why Jenny and I had 'lost contact' she went on to say how Jenny was very upset by my sudden behavior and that it was unfortunate that we were meeting under these circumstances. Her comments annoyed me and I told her that Jenny and I did not speak due to a third party incident. Jenny looked at me surprised and Shannon seemed 'confused' by my statement. I then proceeded to tell her that Jenny and I stopped talking due to her treatment towards me at Jenny's birthday party. Shannon laughed it off and told me I should have 'let it go' as that was nothing more than adult banter. I told her she spitefully withheld food from a child because she expected a child to give her money. Shannon claims that that is not what happened and she would never have done that. They left and later that night Jenny texted me saying she knows her mother was wrong but I was and a**hole to bring that up. I don't believe I am in the wrong but I have to ask, was AITA?", "created_utc": 1672334502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyarfl/aita_for_saying_you_expected_a_child_to_give_you/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she didn't want to hear the answer, then she shouldn't have kept pushing for an answer. As long as you were truthful, then that's that. You're not the one who brought it up, and you tried to be tactful and dodge the question.", "Shannon showed up uninvited and used the opportunity not to make amends but to seek out ways to attack you for exiting a harmful relationship. And your friend ignored your boundaries to bring her mom along after you specifically stated you did not want her there. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nDon't ask questions if you're not willing to accept the answer. Shannon asked the question, you simply answered. Doesn't matter that she has lied to herself all these years about how she handled things. Tell Jenny that you're sorry her mother still wants to cause issues in your friendship. Add that you're still willing to be friends, but not if her mother is involved as you no longer want to have contact with her. If that's a deal breaker, then so be it.", "NTA your mother just died. You can bring up whatever you want. If they hadn't forced a meeting when you'd made it clear you didn't want to then this wouldn't have happened.", "\u201cI know she upset you but how dare you upset her.\u201d FFS\n\nAs if. F\u00a5<k that nonsense. She abused a child. Just respond \u201cyou witheld food from a child\u201d each and every time they make contact. The fact that Jenny wants to rug sweep tells you she\u2019s not a good friend. Write them both off. NTA", "NTA\n\nHer mother continued to push the issue as you tried to ignore and walk away.

She\u2019s supposedly an adult and continues to berate you even when you\u2019re mourning your Mother. This is not okay and you\u2019re right to have no contact with her. \n\nGood on you for standing up for yourself!\n\nI would stipulate this with Jenny as well, that her mothers behaviour AGAIN is not okay and you have a right to stand up for yourself, but unfortunately you may also need to limit this friendship again.\n\nAlso OP, I\u2019m sorry to hear of your loss.", "NTA  She knew exactly why as did Jenny.  Jenny sabotaged any possible relationship now by bringing Shannon without your input.  Dump them.", "NTA truth hurts. I would adv Jenny that event was traumatic to you and remind her you stated you did not want to see her mother. It almost sounds like Jenny is dismissing her mom's behavior.", "NTA. You warned her you didn't want to see her mother, and she did it anyway. She gets what she gets for that.", "I know you welcomed the support of an old friend during a very difficult time in your life, but these people are not your friends. You currently are a shiny object they can show off, due to your tragic circumstances. I don\u2019t mean to be harsh, but you deserve to protect yourself and be treated with kindness and compassion, but you won\u2019t find it from these people.\n\nETA: Absolutely NTA!", "NTA \n\n\u201cMy mother just died. I asked you respectfully to not bring your mom because of our history, and you did anyway. She asked a question, I answered, she tried to blame me, I responded. None of this was my doing, and if I\u2019m being honest at this point I don\u2019t really want to continue this conversation with you at all, and I don\u2019t really think we should be meeting up any time soon\u201d \n\nYou are SO NTA It isn\u2019t even funny. Her mother was rude and publicly humiliated you as a child. Your mom was right to try and protect you from their behavior because I obviously wasn\u2019t going to stop, and your \u201cfriend\u201d should have known better. It\u2019s her job to placate her mother if she wants to, not yours. I hope you have a better support system than her right now, and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You deserve to go through your grief without getting gaslit by a grown woman (Jenny\u2019s mom) trying to change the narrative and play nice after a death. She intentionally inserted herself where she shouldn\u2019t, she can deal with feeling stupid because of It on her own!", "NTA;  Shannon does not get to rewrite history especially of her actions and how the affected others.  I don't think you should have gone further into it than '3rd party incidents' but Shannon set herself up for the ambush.\n\nWas Shannon serious during the party in denying hospitality or joking to you?  I can imagine if it was joke this being a horrifying misunderstanding.", "We need a bot that translates text walls into paragraphs", "ESH\n\nYou got torpedoed by Jenny and Shannon when her mom was invited to dinner after you specifically said you didn\u2019t want to see Shannon. \n\nBut then you were an AH by publicly shaming Shannon in front of her daughter. \n\nI assume your intent wasn\u2019t to alienate your friend, but that\u2019s exactly what you accomplished. \n\nA much better way to do it would hve been to discuss your concerns about Shannon and your experience with Jenny immediately upon her making the invitation. Then have an adult conversation with Jenny about the situation. And if you get surprised in the future, you then have a good reason to get up and leave without comment. \n\nThe absolutely worst thing to do is to stick around when someone you don\u2019t like shows up, and then publicly berate them for being an AH 5 years ago *in front of their family*.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
