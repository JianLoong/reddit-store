She offered to take me out for dinner and planned other activities for us as well. Jenny told me that her mother Shannon (53 F) wanted to see me and also express her condolences as well but I was adamant beforehand that I did not want to meet her. Shannon and my mother never got along due to her treatment towards me. Shannon constantly made snarky remarks to my younger self. When Jenny and I were 14 we ultimately stopped being friends due to Shannon. Jenny had invited me over to her birthday party and at the time my mother did not have enough money to get Jenny a gift. This caused Shannon to become extremely upset and refused to allow me to eat any of the food at the party. She specifically told me that I 'did not bring anything to the table, and was not allowed to eat what she and others had purchased'. I called my mother who berated Shannon for her treatment towards me and left. Upon showing up to our dinner plans, Jenny's mother, Shannon (53 F) unbeknownst to me, was also invited to this outing. While I was upset I decided to not 'cause a scene'  and instead decided to stay and enjoy myself for once in a while. However when Shannon arrived her main focus was why Jenny and I had 'lost contact' she went on to say how Jenny was very upset by my sudden behavior and that it was unfortunate that we were meeting under these circumstances. Her comments annoyed me and I told her that Jenny and I did not speak due to a third party incident. Jenny looked at me surprised and Shannon seemed 'confused' by my statement. I then proceeded to tell her that Jenny and I stopped talking due to her treatment towards me at Jenny's birthday party. Shannon laughed it off and told me I should have 'let it go' as that was nothing more than adult banter. I told her she spitefully withheld food from a child because she expected a child to give her money. Shannon claims that that is not what happened and she would never have done that. They left and later that night Jenny texted me saying she knows her mother was wrong but I was and a**hole to bring that up.
