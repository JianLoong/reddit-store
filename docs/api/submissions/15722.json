This was because she had another job. Today she quit her second job without any notice and is now asking me for my overtime hours. I got these hours because someone at work went on vacation. \n\nI was unemployed for a short period of time and now bills are hounding me, so I was looking forward to working overtime to try and make up for that. \n\nI was supposed to work 19 hours overtime this week. She told me today how she didn\u2019t have a second job anymore, so I gave her 11 of my hours. She\u2019s super nice and sweet, so I could part with them for her sake. \n\nNow she\u2019s asking me for my last 8 hours. There will not be a chance to work overtime like this again for a long time, and if there is she will get them because she has seniority over me. \n\nI don\u2019t want to start issues by telling her no, but I also really need this money too. I am in debt.\n\nMy overtime day is tomorrow, and I\u2019m running out of time to give her my decision. She asked me last second. Our manager doesn\u2019t care who works this shift as long as someone works it. \n\nWIBTA if I tell her no? She doesn\u2019t have any other job. She\u2019s working these hours on top of 3 other days she worked (2 being coverages of the person who is on vacation). So she\u2019s going to get overtime benefits and I\u2019m not. \n\nNext week there will be no overtime and she\u2019ll only be allowed her one day. Maybe she does need these hours more than I do\u2026\n\nAm I being selfish?\n\nUpdate: I told her I would be keeping Wednesday. She\u2019s a reasonable and nice person, I assume she was asking out of desperation. I know she was having problems at her other job that lead up to her quitting, but I didn\u2019t think she would do so as suddenly as she did. She was with that company for 15 years. \n\nThank you everyone for encouraging me to stand my ground. I have trouble drawing a line between what is selfish and what is self-care. All I could see in the moment was that after this week she would have that one day of work a week left while I have all my normal days. I work in a field where compassion is super important for the job (I\u2019m a recovery tech at a rehab), so when it comes to anything regarding work, I start to think really hard about it. \n\nShe was nice when I said I would keep my day. I was scared she\u2019d get mad, but she was still very great full for the hours I did give her. I was scared I would not only upset her, but somehow screw her over, but that wasn\u2019t the case.", "created_utc": 1682503517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zcsog/wibta_if_i_dont_give_all_of_my_overtime_hours_to/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her quitting her primary job without a plan is HER issue.  I would have kept all of the overtime for myself if I needed the hours.  This is not your responsibility.  You have already given more than enough.  No is a complete sentence.  Use that.  YOU need the hours.  Perhaps she should have thought of the consequences of her actions before she left the other job.  She is not your friend.  She is a colleague.  Never sacrifice your necessary work and overtime for someone so selfish.  She will not help you with your bills.  She can never help you out in the same way because she only works one day a week.  You are allowed to keep this for yourself.  You are NOT being selfish.  If she cops an attitude, at least you only have to see her once a week.  Best of luck to you, my friend.", "NTA, dude. Solidarity goes both ways. It\u2019s simple. You gave her what hours you could afford to. Let her know you were happy to help out where you could, and you know times are hard. They\u2019re hard for you too, which is why you need the rest of your hours.", "YWNBTA...you've already been generous. You need the overtime--end of story.", "NTA\n\nThis is one of those \"you aren't required to set yourself on fire to keep another person warm\" situations.", "NTA. She did not plan properly and that\u2019s her problem. Instead of being grateful for the 11 hours, she\u2019s hounding you for the rest. Absolutely not. Make it clear that you\u2019ve already given her more than half of the overtime hours you had and can\u2019t/won\u2019t give her any more.", "YWNBTA - She's chosen to leave her second job and slice her income, she can plug the shortfall herself", "NTA. You are not obliged to sacrifice your finances for hers. Keep you overtime and get yourself out of debt. Trust me if it was reversed she wouldn\u2019t give you hers, this is based on the fact that keeps harassing you.", "No, YWNBTA. You already gave them over half your overtime, which is crazy generous. You deserve to prioritise yourself, it's not like you're hoarding the hours and you have a very good reason for wanting them.", "NTA ... This sounds like a her problem not a you problem", "NTA. This is a 'put on your own oxygen mask first' scenario. Tell her no to the remaining 8 hours, and next time, keep your overtime hours. You've already been generous enough.", "Definitely NTA - you shouldn't have to give anyone overtime hours. I can understand why you did that but you should never be expected to hand someone free hours because of their situation. You're not being selfish at all. You shouldn't be the solution to her problem.", "Nta.  Her lack of planning isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  She had a job, which she quit, through no action by you.  You have bills to pay, for which you took on these overtime hours.  You\u2019ve more than shared what was yours.  Stop now.  You just can\u2019t afford to give up even more hours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No. Her life desicions are not your responsibilities.

The nerve..you quit YOUR job and you go around asking for other people\u2019s hours? As if they don\u2019t need to survive and live and provide as well?

Hell no", "I get she was having trouble at her other job, but if quitting this suddenly meant she\u2019d be in great trouble financially, she was immature for doing so. As an adult, you need to plan things better.

You said she as seniority, therefore I\u2019ll assume she was offered those shifts before you and declined. YOU accepted them. If YOU need the money, they are yours a 100%. She needs to manage her decisions better. \n\nNTA", "You didn't have to give her anything so you have been generous. You do need to learn the art of standing up and asserting though. Her second job is not a you issue. NTA.", "NTA. At the risk of a down vote: Her poor life planning isn't your emergency. IMO, you went above and beyond even giving her some of the hours you were scheduled.", "NTA - you need the money too and you had the opportunity.  To split some hours with her was generous, but keep what you have now and take care of yourself.    People will walk all over you if you let them and IMHO she's walking.....", "NTA but I am surprised you company will let you pick up overtime when there is someone that  wants more hours that can fill it. Normally companies would rather not pay the overtime rate if they don't have to so I do question what your manager is thinking"]}
