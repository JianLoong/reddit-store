I (25F) have been making lego sculptures since I was a kid. When I was living there, I made a few big sculptures, one of which I made with my best friend when we were 16-17 of a big 3D rainbow with a pot of gold and a leprechaun sliding down it. We designed it ourselves. This is art to me. I recently moved out and hadn\u2019t had a chance to move all of my stuff yet. My best friend passed away in a car accident 2 years ago, and we had been friends literally since we were babies. We were like sisters. I have an older brother (32M) who brought my nephew (5M) over to stay at my parents house. He lives out of town and rarely visits. My mom decided it would be okay to let my nephew totally ruin the sculpture I made with my best friend. Not only did it take hundreds of hours, it is also irreplaceable. He broke it into a bunch of pieces and broke some of the pieces. I absolutely lost it at my mom. I told her she had no respect for me, and was a complete piece of shit for letting my nephew destroy one of the most important things I owned. I threatened to sue her. She said that legos are for kids anyway, and that since I moved all of my loose bricks already, he didn\u2019t have any to play with, which just upset me more. I honestly feel like cutting her out of my life, but I have to know, am I the asshole? I know it would take me a long time but I can and do intend to fix it.\n\nEdit: I moved out a little over a week ago, and planned to come for my 2 larger sculptures tomorrow. This sculpture was roughly 4\u2019x6\u2019.

I know how serious it can get. On top of that, it had sentimental value too", "Hey, something I'm qualified for!\n\nThe sculpture was in harm's way the longer it sat at mom's house. My entire collection/builds were sitting in my parents' garage for years during college, if they were destroyed, fair game. \n\nIf your mom knew the sculpture's significance, then you're NTA, she is. If not, then it's a Lego sculpture and cannibalizing it was just a matter of time.\n\nYour anger is justified, but the outburst makes this a ESH situation, in my opinion. Going nuclear and threatening a lawsuit, a bridge too far. \n\n> I know it would take me a long time but I can and do intend to fix it.\n\nFix the sculpture, you mean? Then you've got your plan right in front of you: fix it, strengthen it, get new pieces to replace the faded old ones, redo the details you never liked, and make it something marvelous and commemorative, but unchanged. You've been through a lot and now the sculpture reflects that.\n\nMore practical advice: Lego.com has a great pick-a-brick service, you choose the bricks, color, and quantity, and they mail it to you. I've ordered pounds of Lego from there, it's amazing, I feel like a drug smuggler every time a thick kilo-sized package arrives.\n\nAlso useful but slightly more frustrating is bricklink.com, a third-party seller with vendors all over the world. The merchandise depends on the vendor, so you kinda have to search around for pieces you need (and you gotta buy a lot, to make it worthwhile for the shipping fees and meet the vendors' own minimums).", "You are NTA but this isn't the sub for you. Check out r/raisedbynarcissists", "Soft Y T A. You no longer live there, but you left some Legos behind. Honestly, something you built with legos once with your friend about a decade ago that you left behind because of how important it was to you would likely NOT be considered a work of art by someone else. Your mom probably just saw it as a stack of Legos that you left behind. Toys, your mom saw toys, as did your nephew. It\u2019s unfortunate, because you appear to legitimately have emotions tied into that lego build, but understand that to anyone else it had no intrinsic value beyond being a stack of legos that a kid would play with.", "YTA mildly - I see why you are upset, and I would be too. However, if the piece was that important it should have been one of the 1st things you loaded into your car and moved. You are responsible for your own priceless things.... Personally, I don't think you should ever call anyone names, especially your mother, I dont believe in lowering yourself that much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand your mother is TA also as she knew it was yours and didnt bother to even check if it was ok for the nephew to play with the Legos.", "NTA. Yeah. She did it on purpose. If you can sue, I would. Check with someone about it, even its legal advice on reddit. But cut her off for now. It's the best thing you could do.", "NTA. Your mom is a big one and if you have been gone for a little over a week, sounds like she intentionally destroyed something meaningful to you. \n\nCherish the memories of your friend as that\u2019s what really matters, and consider the sculpture the unfortunate price you had to pay to realize your mom doesn\u2019t deserve space in your life.", "YTA. If you leave your toys at grandma's house, they get played with.\n\nYou should have moved it first if it was that important. \n\nSorry for your loss but that doesn't give you the right to be an AH.", "I think you need to LE-it-GO.  NAH", "YTA", "You put my feelings into words better than I did", "There is no court in the world that would convict a grandmother for letting her grandchild play with Legos that were left behind by the auntie who moved out years ago.

Would you feel differently if it was a painting?", "[removed]", "Would you say the same thing if it was a sculpture *not* made of LEGO?", "I moved out a week ago\u2026", "It would most likely be settled in small claims because it is a personal matter. I'd agree with you but the Lego set is 1) her property even if she had left it at her mother's home, 2) is irreplaceable so it's not like OP or her mother can simply buy another set to replace it and 3) it held sentimental value. OP didn't leave it as something to be forgotten, she didn't have a chance to move it with her. I'm sure OP can do her own research and do what's right for her. At this point, even if she chooses not to file a lawsuit, going LC with the mother seems like the next step anyway.", "Mom had noticed the sculpture in your room before and that it had never been altered in all the time she saw it there, yes?", "I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend, and for this fresh grief.
