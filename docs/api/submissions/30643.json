NTA in short terms he\u2019s abusive and is continually doing this to where she\u2019s walking on eggshells. She needs to go into NC and if ppl try to guilt her she needs to say no. I no longer want to feel the way he had been treating me. I had to do this multiple times to my own grandma and some other ppl about my mom. They usually try to tell me you only have one mother I usually go I still don\u2019t like the treatment and my mental health matters most to me. \n\nAnytime someone tries to pull that line I\u2019m just like and that\u2019s your only kid.

And don't misunderstand your mother guilted you into letting an abusive couple into your life threatening your mental health and happiness!

He showed you who he was.", "NTA\nI advise you to go NC with your father, it's hard it's so heavily pushed that no matter how family members treat you that you can't go NC because they are family. \nMy mother is literally garbage I could write a book about all the stuff she has done to me. Going NC with her has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. People try to guilt me over it, exp now since my Father had passed. But he was the only parent I needed and wanted in my life.

Stop being silent!\n\nAs for the money. No, there is no need in giving it back as it was a gift.
