When I was 10 Y/O my parents got divorced and my dad immediately got re-married. They decided that I would live with my mom and I only visited him during school breaks. Everything was \u201ccivilized\u201d enough till I was 16. My dad asked me to live with him which I completely rejected ( during my visits to him I was never comfortable and his wife did her best to always make me look like the bad person, my room was used as a storage room while I was literally staying in it and on multiple occasions I\u2019ve heard them bad mouth my mother) which took a toll on me but I was silent about it because I was a kid. After I rejected his request he raged at me calling me all types of names. Fast forward a couple of years later, he came back apologizing and after my mom urged me to, I gave him a chance. \nDuring college I had limited breaks so I split them between him and my mom ( one break at each house). During my visit to his house (first year of college). His wife said I did things I didn\u2019t. I tried explaining that but to no avail. Once again they used cruel words to describe me and my mom. I ended up being hospitalized for a week then I fell into a bad state for a year. After therapy I started recovering and because of my brother\u2019s wedding ( 31M) we met again. \nMany family members pushed for me to give him another chance and under pressure once again I gave him a chance. \nHis wife continued to talk badly about me and my mom and continued to do everything possible to affect me badly through the years. \nI\u2019ve dealt with it in silence for years but when it came to my wedding it was a big NO from me to her being involved! \nMy boyfriend had proposed and ofc my dad was included. One year later it was finally the time for the big day. He wasn\u2019t having my choice of not inviting her and it reflected on all his actions. \n(Note: he was always hot and cold, pay for my tuition but treat me badly. Get me a car then ask me to leave his house during a visit)\nHe gave 50k$ as a wedding gift but He showed up to my wedding late, with an angry face and kept talking badly about me to all the guests. His actions once again left me confused and gave me a whiplash of emotions. After that relatives told me that he was mad I didn\u2019t invite his WIFE!!!! \nHis wife took it to her social media describing my family in the worst words possible. Saying how ungrateful I was. \nI didn\u2019t respond but I decided I want to build a future that doesn\u2019t include rollercoaster emotions.\nI\u2019m being called out by some family members for doing that! But as much as his actions are a mess of good and bad, I feel I can\u2019t take it anymore. But now he\u2019s claiming to be sick and I\u2019m once again confused. AITAH?

Live the life you want and deserve, free from the roller coaster of negative emotions. You just have to say \"no\" to any pressure for more contact and you can have the life you want.

For multiple reasons, most of which is my maternal family doesn't want anything to do with him and I would rather have them and respect their wishes. Also, he was an AH my whole life. He doesn't exactly deserve to be directly involved in that kind of event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're NTA for deciding to keep his wife out of the picture. Personally, I wouldn't have invited him, but you did want him there. That's your choice. I would totally invite my father's family - I have a wonderful relationship with them, and I always have - and I'm sure he would understand that I wouldn't want him there.

It will never end until you end it. I'll keep you in my prayers.", "NTA, the money was a gift you don\u2019t need to give it back because then you\u2019re telling him his behavior can continue and he\u2019ll keep treating you like shit.

You are totally justified in avoiding your stepmother (dad's wife), and you should consider avoiding your dad, too, since being with him made you so ill you had to be hospitalized. There has to be a limit to such things! And yes, give his money back. If you keep it and set boundaries with him, he'll probably use it as an excuse to verbally abuse you and keep you hooked in emotionally. You absolutely deserve to lead a life free of this kind of manipulation and abuse.", "And go back to therapy, you need a good therapist who can help you navigate this difficult situation.", "Yep!!! I call it asshole tax!!", "This is the way.", "I\u2019m really sorry you had to deal with this, I know how it feels to be let go of for no reason. And I also know how it feels like to see your mom in pain. Thank you for sharing your story, and I hope you make a great life for yourself.", "Of course. It's always nice to know there are people around you who understand what you're going through. Growing up, I had one other friend that was raised by a single mom. She was the only one I truly confided in about my struggles, and I tried turning my pain into a joke for others around me.\n\nI guess that's why I tend to read a lot of these. They help me find others who understand. I hope you can try to at least patch this incident up with your father, even if you don't want to give him another chance later on. Don't let this drag you down! <3"]}
