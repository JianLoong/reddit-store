We\u2019ve basically been in no contact for 6 weeks now. I messaged her and asked her to send me my ticket and she refused. She said it was her idea and she deserves to have a good time with someone she\u2019s actually friends with. I told her that\u2019s not how it works as I\u2019ve been looking forward to the show and just cause she has both tickets in her possession doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re her tickets. After a bunch of back and forth I told her I\u2019ll send her husband screenshots of her admitting to her infidelity if she doesn\u2019t send me my ticket. \n\nMind you when we purchased these tickets Matt Rife didn\u2019t have the presence he has now. We purchased tickets for an intimate show for a ridiculously low price. He\u2019ll be back in town again in a couple months again and those tickets are for a much larger venue and going to cost more than $500 to purchase. \n\nShe sent me a message a couple days later saying we should go together regardless if we\u2019re friends because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I thought the issue was settled and we\u2019d go to the show and have move on with our lives. \n\nThat was until she texted me saying she tried to purchase tickets for another Matt Rife for her and her sister and she got scammed out of $300. She was wondering if I really wanted to go or if she could take her sister instead. I told her that I have planned on going and don\u2019t plan on giving away my ticket. \n\nAfter a couple days of silence she said that she\u2019s no longer taking me and is giving my ticket to her sister. She said that if I decide to tell her husband I\u2019ll have repercussions coming my way. \n\nI know that taking the high road is the mature thing to do, but I can\u2019t have the thought of her continuously stepping all over me after everything she\u2019s done to me in the past. Hoping this post will give me either clarity or validation.\n\nEdit - all the responses have been very eye opening, Ty. To be clear, the ticket was only $30. Even if I sued her there\u2019s no chance we\u2019d settle it before the show date to get my ticket back. They\u2019d award me $30 which is what it would cost to file a claim.", "created_utc": 1688767071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tks5w/aita_if_i_tell_my_ex_friends_husband_about_her/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You knew what kind of person she was and still remained friends with her.  When she was hurting someone else (her husband) you were fine with being friends with her.  Now that her behavior is negatively affecting you, you have a problem with her and feel the need to tell the husband out of revenge, not because it\u2019s the right thing to do.  He deserves to know.  She deserves to have things blow up in her face.  You should have known not to be friends with someone with low morals who doesn\u2019t respect relationships, so I don\u2019t feel bad for you.", "ESH. You should tell him, no question, but you should do it because it's the RIGHT thing to do, not because she is finally fucking you over the way she fucks over everyone, especially her husband.", "DO IT", "What is a Matt Rife?", "ESH\n\nYou're both literally criminals. \n\nShe's an AH, and a criminal, for refusing to give you a ticket that is legally yours, bought and paid for. It may be in her possession but it no longer belongs to her, and she has no right to use it or give it to anyone except its owner: you. \n\nYou're an AH, and a criminal, for blackmailing her. In case you've been living under a rock somewhere, blackmail is illegal. I get that you're angry with her and you have every right to be. What you don't have a right to do is blackmail her to get your property back. You can ask her for it; you can show up on her doorstep and demand it; you can try going to the cops and informing them that she is holding property of yours that you have paid for and refusing to give it to you; or ultimately, if she keeps the ticket and goes to the concert, you can take her to small claims court and try to get your money back (and maybe even damages for making you miss something you'd been looking forward to and had a de facto contract with her that you'd be going to). You cannot blackmail her.\n\nThat she is cheating on her husband is an entirely separate issue from the concert. Frankly, I also think that you're an AH if you know that someone's spouse is cheating on them and you don't tell them, and choose to hold back that information for personal leverage. That's her husband's entire life you're playing games with, which is horrifying. So you're an AH for that too. \n\nNeither one of you seems to care about anyone except yourselves in a situation where an innocent man's life is being used as leverage for stupid concert tickets. Shame on both of you. ESH.", "ESH. Might as well tell the sister that friend stole the ticket and see if that helps. And the husband about the cheating. But yeah.  You're friends with a crummy person and surprised now that she's crummy to you.", "Definitely tell the husband! \n\nTake extra precautions on your belongings /property to ensure that if they\u2019re damaged you have proof she did it. (Cameras hidden or in plain view, dash cams) I\u2019m sure she will also text you or call you and say the same thing after you air it to her husband. Make sure you document that too. She\u2019s in the wrong bc she agreed to go together then changed her mind. She knows you have the proof she just thinks she\u2019s intimidated you enough you won\u2019t air out her dirty laundry.

So you're okay with staying silent as she betrays her husband but her selling your Matt Rife ticket is where it crosses the line for you?!? That makes you look petty as hell, particularly since this a decision that will hurt an innocent party. If you start throwing dirt, expect some to be coming back your way. Did you really expect her to agree to sit next to you after you threatened to blackmail her?!?
