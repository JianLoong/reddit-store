When one of her investment properties was vacated unexpectedly, she asked me if I want to move in for, basically, free. It was a fully furnished Duplex Condo. As our lease ends in January, and one of my roommates Bill(25M) proposed to his girlfriend, I asked my other roommate Varun(22M) if he want to move in. He agreed to pay all the utilities and bills.\n\nMy plan was to ask my girlfriend Vedha(23F) to move in with me soon. Since she and Varun are distant cousins and the condo being pretty big, it wouldn't be a dealbreaker for her to share. But it all changed when Bill asked if he could move in with us till his wedding. Bill and his fianc\u00e9, Beth(23F), want to save up to put a deposit on bigger home. I agreed since it was only till the wedding which was in 9 months.\n\nThe final deal was, I won't charge them any rent and they will cover all the bills and utilities. We decide to keep our old place till the end of Jan and move in slowly.\n\nThe incident in question happened when a few of our friends got together in the new condo to party/break in the new home. Beth was in full on bride mode planning everything. As her MOH and few bridesmaids are in our friend group, our every get-together is turning into wedding talks, and this was no different.\n\nUnlike Varun, who was born in US, Vedha is here in states on L1 work visa. She adjusted well, but sometimes she's is like a fish out of water. Being a curious person, she politely either asks me or someone else to explain if she didn't understand something.\n\nBeth started bragging about how it's going to be a BIG wedding with 200 guests. V got genuinely confused and asked if it's really considered a big wedding. I said yes and left it at that, but one of the bridesmaids asked V if it's not considered big in India. She sheepishly said yes. When pushed further she said for her big weddings mean an upwards of 2k guests.\n\nThe bridesmaid got intrigued and started asking V about Indian weddings. V also got into in because she wanted to know more about American weddings. The topic turned to child free weddings and V said she never attended one. Apparently, Indian weddings are mostly never child free.\n\nI guess Beth got annoyed (she is having a child free), and started making snide comments such as how they(Indians) might not be able to afford babysitters etc.\n\nV grew uncomfortable. I finally had enough when Beth compared her own job with V's. I laughed in her face and said V makes more money than all of the others in the house combined, and asked her to leave.\n\nBill got involved and started making excuses about how she's stressed about the wedding, and if she leaves, V had to leave too as we share the house now.\n\nHere's where I might be the TA. I said no, we didn't sign any agreement yet and he can forget about it until Beth apologizes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Sorry a bit of confusion. V didn't move in yet. I wanted to ask V to move in with me after a few months, but as Bill asked me if he can move in, I decided not to ask her until his wedding.

Who the hell do they think they are!?!\n\nQuite frankly, I wouldn't let Bill and his bridezilla move in, even if they apologized. Beth has already demonstrated that she's in some kind of competition with Vedha, and that she's willing to disparage Vedha & her culture in order to elevate herself. Vedha doesn't need that, and you shouldn't allow her to be placed in a living situation where Beth has 24/7 opportunity to make snide, disparaging remarks to/about Vedha.\n\nBeth is 100% an AH, and so is Bill for thinking her behavior was even remotely okay.\n\n[Edited to correct typos ]", "NTA \n\nBeth was being unnecessarily rude.

That is just the beginning - she is going to go full bridezila", "NTA you also gave the opportunity to apologize, you're absolutely free of guilt", "NTA Beth was BEYOND rude and I\u2019m not sure how you could expect V to feel comfortable in your home after that. Stress is no excuse to be mean", "NTA. The racist micro aggressions are getting old. No it's not because Beth is stressed about the wedding, she's just upset she got called out for her heinous behavior.", "NTA. \n\nGood leadership taking control of the situation in a reasonable manner.", "NTA\n\nAsk them politely to find their own place if you want to stay friends, apology or not.

Its 9 months out its going to get so much worse. \nProtect yourself, your friendship and Vedha. \nBeth and Bill can get their own place. Its not up to you to help them save money ?", "NTA Please don't let them move in. Bill invited him himself to live free with you, with his fiancee. They will never move out. Save for a house? They first save for this 200+ people wedding. And then houses are fucking expensive now. Before they have enough money together she will be pregnant! And Bill showed already that he felt he have rights to say who can stay in YOUR house. If his fiancee must leave, yours must also go? Wtf?! Who do he think he is?! Living with them will be hell, they will behave as if it is their house!", "Okay, Beth was behaving rudely, ~~but essentially kicking her and Bill out with less than 2 weeks to find a new place to live is pretty callous of you too~~.\n\nEDIT: oops, my mistake. the lease on the old place runs to end of Jan so enough time.
