She may be watching you dote over a baby (as you should, and also sprinkle pancakes sound amazing) and being triggered because she didn't have that. Or feeling like she desperately wants to love you all and connect to you all but she can't because of trauma or attachment injury. \n\nI work with a lot of kids in foster care or family care, I see so much trauma and attachment issues. It's heartbreaking. Kids who've been with amazing caregivers for years who cry because they still don't feel truly loved, and some who say they're worried they never will actually *feel* love. I see them turn to substances or unsafe/unhealthy romantic and sexual relationships to fill that gap. \n\nI'd reach out to the social worker that was assigned and ask for help and support.

She did. She has a full time job at 17 and must be reasonably mature for her age as she has been promoted to manager. \n\nYou asked her to save. She has. She is saving to get out of your house at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYou asked her to get her GED, not go to school, which suggests things have happened in her teenage years that caused her to drop out of school. Now she is self studying things? Shows me maturity and wisdom.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to play happy family with you and your baby daddy. He is not your husband. He has expressed no interest in permanency or you would already be married. She does not want to participate in what might be viewed as yet another unstable family environment. \n\nAnd somewhere in the legal realm, OP, you\u2019re full of crap. If a child is placed with a family member in an official capacity, the family member gets support checks from the state.

More importantly, why was she handed over to you by OCS?", "I\u2019m more concerned with your lack of heart than hers. She is 17 and was until recently was in a super traumatic situation. Her interacting with the baby is about your feelings, it is not harming the baby in any way. I\u2019ve also got to say if you were pregnant 9 mo than ago you absolutely have zero reason to give a child that young pancakes with sprinkles, so they cen if she was rude about it she\u2019s not wrong. You are asking her to force a smile on and okay with your baby to make YOU happy, hat is a ridiculous burner to put on a traumatized teen. You can have rules about having to speak to you with respect but it is super unhealthy to try to force her to interact with the baby and will only hurt the relationship.", "YTA.\n\nWhy won't she interact with your kid?  She may be afraid that you're going to pass the baby off to her for her to take care of him.  She also might just not like babies or have some sort of trauma that the baby is triggering.  Babies cry, some cry a lot, and that might be causing issues for her.  \n\nShe's 17, she was in an unsafe if not abusive home, and she's a minor.  If you kick her out now, she'll have a hard time getting a safe place to live.  Kicking her out because she doesn't like your kid and doesn't want to interact with him is likely to mess her up worse.  She's not doing chores and she's overly critical at times - and you have a right to be upset about that - but I guarantee you that she'll see this as you threw her out because she didn't smile enough at your kid.\n\nMost teenagers push boundaries because that's part of growing up.  Kids with trauma tend to act out. Your sister is doing both.  Not a big surprise.

I think you are just overwhelmed at the moment. Please step back and look at the big picture. Her interacting with your baby is not the most important thing. She is bettering herself by getting her education. She is gainfully employed. You don\u2019t mention that she is a behavior problem with drugs or alcohol so she\u2019s a good kid. Most likely, she doesn\u2019t want to get too attached because of her traumatic experiences. Kids need safety and love. Would you kick out your baby because he wouldn\u2019t look at you or do a chore? Of course not. Your sister deserves the same because you are who she has. You are helping her have a successful adult life and that is so important. BTW, all 17 yr olds are difficult to get to do chores so this is a practice run for 16 yrs from now.", "Although you didn\u2019t have paperwork given to you by CPS, there is still paperwork on your case. The reason I mention that is because at 17 she is still a minor and was placed in your care. You cannot just kick her out because you don\u2019t like that she\u2019s having a hard time adjusting and dealing with everything going on. Your child is not her responsibility, and it\u2019s not her responsibility to make sure that she smiles and does whatever *you* feel is appropriate.

She needs to be seen by a therapist and if you're responsible for taking her and helping her get access to the mental health care that she needs then you are in the wrong because she is a minute and needs the help of an adult to do these things. You started in your post that she is doing well at her job and that she has her own car and while she stays with you, she also has the opportunity to save money so she can start her life right when it's time for her to move out. So you're going to take that away from her over a petty (on your behalf) argument about her not paying enough attention to your baby? She has been through a traumatic experience in being abused by her mother and removed from her safe (i use that term very loosely in this situation fyi) space and into a household with you. I understand that it was stressful for you as you had just had a baby but what kind of sister are you that you'd just toss her aside like that?

Does your sister have a case manger, was your mom going through the reunification process?\n\nFor an official placement, there is documentation, court order and benefits that can come with that (like psych evals, special Medicare enrollment to cover Healthcare expenses, referrals for mental health providers, a family caregiver stipend etc) \n\nIf you don't know, you need to call and ask. I understand that the timing was terrible. But in 9 months I would have expected you or your husband to try and get more information.  \n\nAnd don't pressure her about ignoring the baby. \n\nYour sister suffered physical abuse, is not in any mental health treatment and probably feels like the outsider to your perfect family.", "Time to discuss this with her CPS case worker/contact.

She'd rather isolate in her room all day and ignore the whole family for 12 hours because she knows you don't want her there.   She is working.  In my opinion she is going to move out the day she turns 18 years old because she is responsible enough to work and she is saving money.   Of course she should help you and yours.   You are providing a roof over her head and food in her belly.  Of course she should appreciate you but she doesn't want to be there anymore than you want her there.   Bide your time until she turns 18 years old.   It is wonderful that you are trying to guide her in the right direction so she can be self-sufficient.  Maybe tell her you love her.", "Would guess NAH you are frustrated with the o erall situation and due to that focused on the negatives,but she was taken from her home and that tends to be an indicator that something major has happened and she might be traumatized,especially getting confronted with a more healthy family life might trigger her even more.\n\nAlso sidenote would also Stoff a little to give a 9 months old something with sprinkles as there is a possibility of chocking hazard", "There's a lot of good comments in here but you are in for a **big** surprise with your own child if you're going, my sister was so badly abused by my mother, CPS removed her from her care, why doesn't she smile enough?\n\nWhere exactly do you think she's going to go? If you want her out because you're annoyed she's there, which sounds more truthful, are you looking for places for her? Why do you have a $160/month Internet bill?", "YTA She's going through a hard time as well, it's always a red flag when you see people you care about isolate themselves and your first instinct is to be mad at them and point the finger. Then when they end their lives it's \"I had no idea\".

She's not even an adult yet.", "I think people are missing the forest through the trees. Everyone is very focused on how the sister came from a traumatic childhood, but OP did as well.  In a different post she comments house she left the home at 13. You think that happened because their mom was kind and caring? The OP it's probably terrified that her child might get some kind of taste of what their childhood was like. Both of the sisters need to sit down and talk about real boundaries, as well as their wants and expectations from this arrangement.", "YTA. Ma'am, it's understandable that you think your baby is the best thing since spam, but not everyone does.  It appears your sister is one of those people.  Let her be.

Gently encourage occasionally, but otherwise leave the topic alone.", "YTA: She\u2019s not wrong about giving your baby sugary sprinkles at 9 months, I\u2019d judge that, too. You usually don\u2019t give sugar to an at until they\u2019re about 2! \n\nBut your sister is a young girl at a pivotal point in life, with what I imagine is an awful Childhood and upbringing. Kicking her out with no where to go sounds cruel. Nothing you described is particularly egregious. She\u2019s just a teen.

Honestly, as someone with PTSD from childhood trauma I want to say lower your expectations of her for now, learn about trauma and keep trying to gently encourage trauma therapy.\n\nHere is SAMHSA\u2019s guidance for a trauma-informed approach: https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/d7/priv/sma14-4884.pdf", "Did any of it involve reproductive coercion or losing a pregnancy or child?", "Sister or not, if you are living in my home and around my children you will treat us with basic respect or you are not welcome.", "And the child is not a random child either it's her nephew , and regardless if you are sharing space with people you should treat them with basic human decency and acknowledged their existence even if its a literal baby .", "Please do not get me wrong.  YOu are are great, and doing great by her.   You are justified in telling her to move.", "Yes, and she is also refusing therapy as per OP\u2019s comments. There\u2019s not a lot OP can do at this point, except ask her to leave or put up with a very difficult situation in her own home.", "Yes, just research them.", "Exactly! I\u2019m praising her for taking her sister in but her post basically says I want to kick her out which makes me incredibly nervous for this poor young girl. She\u2019s suffering and all this lady can talk about is getting her out of her house for not smiling at her kid. \n\nThe young sister is literally traumatized. She needs help and by rights, OP is responsible for making that happen.", "And we don't know her history with therapy or therapists. Not all therapists are good people and some of them can be legitimately traumatizing and make anyone feel gunshy about wanting to attempt therapy again.", "At 17 you can pretty much stay where you want as long as your parents don\u2019t object and even then it can be difficult to force somebody to stay with their parents.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s in her file and cps knows where she is but the mother officially has custody. Since the situation is resolved/safe in their eyes there\u2019s no need for further action.", "I don't get paid no. And our mom knows as well", "I apologize, i was pretty fired up about this post tbh and i directed my frustration at the wrong person.", "I don't think op knows what decompressing is. Or what ptsd is.", "I can definitely agree with all of that. Like I said, not arguing, I don't think the working amount changes it for me either way. Op might be be an AH - but definitely isn't doing their best to do what's right for a child she accepted care of.", "Right. Everyone talking about trauma, which is probably true for the isolating part, but some people just don't like kids. It doesn't have to something deep.", "No nothing like that", "I really commend you for taking her in. I wish you had asked for help on getting your sister real help rather than AITAH for kicking her out.\n\nSomeone above posted a really good article about getting a teen into therapy when they may not want to be there. I hope that you read that and are taking away something from it. \n\nLike I said, I really commend you, but your sister is struggling and she shouldn\u2019t be responsible for \u2018smiling\u2019 at your kid. She doesn\u2019t have much to smile about right now. \n\nShe\u2019s literally not homeless and that\u2019s the best she has at this moment. You clearly don\u2019t want her there. I\u2019m sure your husband doesn\u2019t want her there . Her mom is a mess and she\u2019s struggling. \n\nYet all you can do is think about her turning 18 and getting her out of your house. I just feel bad for her.", "How do you know? You said she refused therapy. There's a chance she is not telling you things.", "That you know of."]}
