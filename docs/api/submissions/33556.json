We split after a few years of his mother making my life hell and many miscarriages. Incidentally, i found out i was pregnant two weeks after we split. He begged me to get back together with him and even though i still loved him, i knew that we weren\u2019t going to last. \n\nI had our son this august and we\u2019ve decided to do Christmas together year for him. My ex had also gone NC with his family for the role they played in our split so i don\u2019t want him to be alone during the holidays. He\u2019ll be coming over to my mothers place on Christmas eve and leaving on the 26th as is normal to do in our family for christmas as we open presents on the eve, go to church on the day and then have dinner together that evening. \n\nMy ex also gets along really well with a lot of my male cousins and my older brothers so it hopefully won\u2019t be awkward.\n\n\nNaturally, this situation has been giving me a lot of stress. My ex still wants us to work it out, we\u2019re in the midst of our divorce, i\u2019m suffering from health problems from the birth etc. I\u2019ve been talking about this non-stop with my therapist and she coined the term \u2018co-parent christmas\u2019. I find the term funny and i guess when i put it like that, i can effectively compartmentalise what is stressing me out exactly between general holiday stress or my ex being there. I\u2019ve started using the term with friends and family too.\n\nMy ex came over yesterday to drop off his presents for my family members (my mom likes to get all the presents in her house when she\u2019s hosting by the 22nd so she can organize them properly, we have a huge family) and we discussed the arrangements a little. He comes over daily just to see the baby too because he\u2019s still exclusively breastfed. \n\nI used the term \u2018co-parent christmas\u2019 and he got a funny look on his face but never said anything. Later on, he called me to say that he didn\u2019t like the term as it reminded him of his failure as a husband and how it meant that he didn\u2019t get to experience any sort of family christmas this year. I felt absolutely awful and i even teared up as i apologized. I even lost a little sleep over it and i spoke to my older brother and he said i was an AH for not being mindful over how i spoke to my ex.

You do not need to be \"mindful\" to someone who was not mindful to you. It's not a family christmas because he is not your family. This is merely a consequence to his (lack of) actions. If he's struggling with coming to terms with the fact that he failed as a husband, those feelings are his to manage, not yours. NTA.", "NTA, but do yourself a favor and put some distance between the two of you.  Otherwise OP will continue to be stressed, family will be confused/make assumptions, and the guy will continue to use this \"in\" as a way to push getting back together.", "Setting a boundary that 1) you are getting divorced, and 2) you are no longer a family unit is not inapprpriate.  I get that it may sting for some, but, if said without malice or glee, it is not an inappropriate distinction to make.  \n\n\nYou need to have a conversation with your brother.  My guess is that he disagrees with your decision to divorce.  It would be best for you and he to air out that conversation", "NTA...I like the term!  In the same way you've had to seek help and get your mind around the situation, your ex needs to do the same.  He may have some emotional reaction to the term, but it IS the reality that he needs to face. He too may need to seek help to get through this.", "NTA\n\nI think the term is helpful. You are in the midst of a divorce, your ex wants to get back together, your figuring out what's best for your kid - this term establishes some boundaries. \n\nI wish you a merry Christmas and happy co-parenting year", "NTA, maybe if he had stood up for you when his mother was making your life hell, you'd be a family and not co parents", "NTA, but you're not doing him any favours stringing him along like this. Your kid is not even going to know it's Xmas so it's not worth doing for his sake. Get some distance.", "He did fail? Don't wanna be reminded, don't fail. He f Ed up , he pays the consequences", "NTA, especially from the outside looking in. I can see that it's the first year and you both are too close to the situation to get a good feel for it, but the idea of a \"co-parent christmas\" to me brings the idea of two individuals who are cordial and friendly enough and can communicate even though they can't live in the same house and be a \"couple,\" they can still have a united front for their child(ren). \n\nA team. Being on a team doesn't mean you sleep in the same bed as your teammates every day. You get together for training and games and then go back to your own lives, but when it comes to \"the game\" (in this case, raising a child) you're on the same page and sharing the responsibilities and aren't at each others throats.", "NTA. You and your ex are in different places. You used that term your therapist suggested because it helps you. It is not innately offensive or inappropriate. Your ex is struggling too but you don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. You are already trying to make it work primarily for him - because let's face it, a 4 month old doesn't notice of care if his parents are together for Christmas - and the idea that you have to also put on a whole charade pretending you're a happy family is, to me, a bridge too far. \n\nMore than anything it sounds like you're navigating a tough situation together, and there is a beauty in that. It wasn't fair for him to nitpick your choice of words OR the fact that - indeed - you see it as a coparenting endeavor not a 'happy family' endeavor, and your bro was an AH for choosing to critiicize you over it.", "NTA, he can learn to manage his own delicate fee-fees since he never gave a shit about how his family handled yours.", "Well he was a failure as a husband, so I don't see why you need to tip toe around his feelings.  You are way too enmeshed with your ex.  Either get a divorce and separate or go into marriage therapy and fix it.  This half in half out stuff is just hurting both of you.  You aren't having Christmas together for your son.  Your son isn't even a year old.  Your son doesn't give a fuck.  You are having Christmas together for your ex.  Be honest with yourself.  NTA, but you need to seriously evaluate where you are going in life.", "NAH\n\nLook, there are a lot of sensitivities to be negotiated here. But you are all doing your best. The term is not offensive or intended to be. You are co-parents working out what you need to do  together. Your hormones are still all over from giving birth and you are is a stressful situation. As is he which is why he is over-sensitive. You can't watch over every word.", "NTA.  But I do think it\u2019s weird that your husband is still exclusively breastfed.", "NTA what\u2019s with guys today, is everyone of them just a total child?  You did nothing wrong, and why does the husbands ass need to be kissed every 2 seconds.  Co parent is a reasonable term.  Part of it is the guys refusal to accept reality that the divorce is happening g so he\u2019s freaking out", "Oh fuck that. Your ex did fail and if being reminded of that hurts his widdle feefees he can cry himself a river.\nYou are NTA. \n\nYou are still recovering from being pregnant and childbirth. You are exclusively breastfeeding. You are going through the stress of divorce caused by abusive in-laws and your ex\u2019s failure to protect you and your relationship. Any way you are able to protect yourself and have boundaries is appropriate. \n\nCo-Parent Christmas for the win!", "It is a co-parent Christmas. Your ex isn't your family. It's not your problem he went No Contact with his family after your divorce. It's not your problem that he regrets your divorce. Next year your child will be old enough that you can spilt Christmas. Managing your ex-husband's emotions isn't your responsibility anymore. NTA", "Treat your divorce like a business transaction if you don\u2019t things will get muddy. What kind of parenting plan do you want to have when you\u2019re divorced?  Surely you\u2019re not going to allow daily visits?  What if he or you meet someone else how will that work?  You need to take emotion out of this process. Sorry to be so blunt but good luck with everything.", "I mean, I don't see why you couldn't just call it \"Christmas\" in front of your ex. NAH.\n\nAfter reading your comments, you need to set clear boundaries with your ex. You see him every day. That's not going to change unless you put your foot down.", "It is sad that it took you being emotionally brought down to the point your last straw broke for him to see the damage his family did and go NC. I love the term and think it is a gentle way to relay to him what this means to you. He, wanting to reconcile, could easily take the holiday and the fact that he gets along so well with many in your family to create a false hope that the time will be for reconciliation and building new family memories. He does not like the term because it does not fit his desire to win you back and reminds him of where your heart and head are.  It may hurt a little for him to hear it as it a reminder of what he lost, but to change it back to 'family Christmas' would likely give him a false hope that you are changing your mindset, and he has a chance. Better to give him the mindset of the reality of his symbolic place in your heart and mind so he can enjoy the time with people he gets along really well with, spend time with his son and enjoy being able to co parent with his son's mom and not look everywhere for signs and hope for something you are not able nor willing to give him.", "Could you start expressing milk so he can have one bottle a day so you don\u2019t have to see your ex partner when he comes over? Might make it easier on both of you to get some distance between you", "NTA - aww he still loves you and wants it to work. It\u2019s little therapy nuggets like that - well they feel like distancing tactics. And they are. He expressed how it hurt him, you felt his truth and that\u2019s that -  and just move on from it.", "Quit being a fucking doormat. This \"family christmas\" that is so stressing you out doesn't even need to happen because said baby he claims to be there for is only 4 months and couldnt give a single fuck about christmas if it wanted to. He also doesn't need to come over every day.\n\nGet a custody agreement on file with the court and stick with it. This whole post is a problem of your own making.", "NAH", "NTA. Your ex still thinks that you'll drop the divorce and get back together with him. He needs to understand that that won't happen. I think he wants to spend Christmas with you because he's hoping that it means you're open to reconciliation. That's why he got upset when you said that. But you shouldn't give him false hope; you didn't need to apologize.", "NTA. \n\nYou chose that term because it described your own feelings on the situation. \nHe voiced how it hurt and it seems you understand why, and feel bad about it. \n\nFeel bad for him though. He hasn\u2019t ever really had a family when you think about it. Anyone who would treat your wife like shit doesn\u2019t care much about you, so honestly this is a pretty natural conclusion to things. He will have to build one for himself.", "NAH - no one sucks here. There is no asshole. Just a difficult situation. Everyone is telling you to stop letting him come around so often. They are telling you that your baby won't remember his dad not being there. He will know when he sees the pictures and videos when he is older. You are doing something incredible for your child. You are putting aside your difficulties with your ex to make sure your son has both of his parents in his life. \n\nWhen your son is older he's going to be able to look back and see how his parents put him first and worked together to be good parents even though they weren't a good fit as partners. When you do eventually go to court to get your custody sorted it will also reflect well on you that you made efforts to include his dad even though you were breastfeeding. Breastfeeding does not mean automatic full custody.", "NAH\n\nYou are two imperfect humans with open wounds fumbling around trying to do the right thing, both for yourselves, for each other, and for your kid. Try as you both might, chances are you're both going to say \"ouch\" at least once through all this.", "NTA boundaries and setting them early days can suck.\nI get you trying separate things and frankly he's spending Christmas with his son who is his family so maybe pointing that out might help him feel better.\nI do understand it stinging for him tho but I want to ask, do you think he mentioned it because it feels bad and he would prefer something that doesn't or was it to guilt/ manipulate you? The first is okay but the second is a real issue and I'd suggest waaay more boundaries if you think that's the case.\nBut idk the dude, you do.", "Nta, your therapist recommended the term because is best for your mental health\n\nStop being so concerned about your ex feelings, I bet he didn't care about yours when his family mistreated you \n\nYou are divorced\n\nStart thinking about yourself", "NTA you plan to get back together with your ex.", "NTA: this is about your mental health. Not his. You worry about your mental health first. His comes in dead last. He wasn\u2019t worried about you until you wanted a divorce. \n\nYour top priority (after your mental health) is your son. You are not doing you or your son any favors by doing things that make you uncomfortable. If you start limiting contact with your ex, it will be normal for him growing up. You can\u2019t just go from seeing your ex everyday and every holiday to just not one day just because your child is older. You set those standards now. It\u2019ll be easier. You feel bad for your ex, but ultimately he made decisions to allow his family to treat you like crap for years. He hasn\u2019t earned the term family. \n\nCoparenting Christmas is a great term. Tell your brother to back off.", "NTA but don\u2019t let these people bully you into not allowing your ex the opportunity to bond with his child. It is imperative for that bond to start early for both baby and dad. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that your wellbeing or feelings should be pushed aside or belittled. It\u2019s unfortunate that he felt that way but actions have consequences and some of his previous actions led to this situation you all are facing now. It\u2019s hard and it\u2019s going to continue to be hard and the best thing to do is to focus on what you feel is best for your child and yourself. If that means distancing some from your ex then do that, if that means allowing him to see the baby do that.", "YTA he cut his family off and you basically drew a clear line pointing out that he is the outsider.", "NTA at all. Its good that you are trying to set boundaries. Ignore your asshole brother, he should have your back and make it clear to your ex that that is exactly what this is - co-parent Christmas.\n\nTime to start to distance yourself from your ex. When he visits the baby head out and grab a coffee or go for a walk (take advantage that as a single mother of a baby you can have some 'me time'). Reduce the overlap until its barely there is a good starting step. Get one of those co-parenting apps and put all communications through it. Explain to ex that you just want to keep a healthy boundary between you both as friendly co-parents but not actual friends.\n\nCome up with a plan with your therapist and a lawyer on how you can delicately adjust custody so you aren't seeing your ex every day while also try and prevent being accused of keeping him from the baby by the flying monkeys like your asshole brother.", "YTA", "YTA - It's unnecessarily passive aggressive at best, gaslighting at worst.", "Ya so your family loves your ex obviously. I think they think you'll get back with him and he thinks you will too if he wears you down enough. I in no way think your the ahole here but neither do I think he is. He did take drastic steps to try to get you back which is great but overall not what you want. You shouldn't feel bad about co-parenting. You should see if he would be willing to go to a therapy session with you so you both can discuss and find a way where you're new co-parenting relationship can move forward in a healthy way.

They aren\u2019t aligned so do yourself a favor: if he\u2019s an awful partner, don\u2019t create moments where you can be viewed as family.

Please stop trying to manage his emotions for him. You are no longer his wife. You are not his mother. It is not your job to make him feel better when he's hit with the consequences of his own actions.

He only had to sit with that guilt an hour or two before calling you and getting you to immediately apologize and take on all that guilt. \n\nYou were so close to setting a boundary, he didn't like it so he manipulated you into backing off and reassuring him. It might have been subconscious but that's what happened. Keep using Co-Parent Christmas.

You can restrict the time of day, you can designate only certain days for visits, you can even have visits be on neutral ground instead of having him come over to your place. Even with Christmas, he can stay Christmas Eve for presents, then go back home. It's not fair to you that he keeps disrespecting you by begging to get back together.

In theory he will eventually have some custody of baby, yes? So he needs some solo time with baby to bond. And so you can plan to meet up and hand over baby for an afternoon someplace like a coffee shop or library, and then you can go do your own thing while he bonds with baby. There, now you have the perfect excuse to stop \"playing happy family\" when he visits baby.", "Hey OP I know your getting a lot here, but infant child custody  schedule is totally a thing and your divorce lawyer should be able to help you out.

That's kinda part of being a parent. Sometimes that's just not an option. You do have a reason, he is overstepping. He's still fully convinced he can wear you down into taking him back.

I would keep in mind that this arrangement should be changed as soon as the baby isn't basically attached to you. Also, maybe putting some restrictions on his visits like you leaving the general area they are in while he's over or he takes the baby for a walk around the neighborhood. Then you're there if needed but don't need to interact with ex as much.", "the reason is YOUR mental health, which in turn affects your baby. your baby can tell when you are stressed and uncomfortable, and you don\u2019t need to put yourself through that EVERY single day", "Let him take the baby somewhere by himself then", "Yes, there is lot of reasons :  all the reasons why you are divorcing in the first place.\n\nListen, eventually, after some years you'll met another guy that you want to marry, and this guy will be a stepfather to your son.\n\nThe father will get at some point (if you stop your nonsense of seeing him everyday) that he too have look elsewhere, and will bring a stepmother in your big family picture. \n\nNow, in some healthy, sane blended families, the kiddos will bond with all the adults, considering them all as parental figure with some closers than other (and the closeness can be about sharing the same hobbies or the same humor between a kid and a co-parent). When adults are not playing the mean game of possessiveness, jealousy and manipulation with the kids, they grow up bonding with the adults they share the most with and respecting and listening everyone.\n\nMaybe it seems to you an unreachable situation, or maybe not even a desirable one. \n\nThe point is that \"bonding\" is essential for the baby as it needs it for psychological and emotional growth, but it doesn't need multiples adults to do so with. **And it can happens way later in life**\n\nBaby need a primary caretaker, that it will bond with, be fed by, and be emotionally *attached and dependent*. \n\nEmotionally dependent : like a sponge your baby is influenced by all your emotions, and as you are breastfeeding, he is actually absorbing your emotional state literally.\n\nStress-related hormones like cortisol are present in breast milk. When a mother experiences stress, her body produces cortisol, and some of it may enter breast milk. \n\nSo from the baby's point of view, because this situation is putting you under lot of stress, I think it would be better off by seeing his father *less*... and have a better milk quality ! \n\nFather will be able to bond by doing real parenting when the baby will be weaned, and participate in his education by taking care of the child alone for half days, then whole days, then every weekend or so (not before 2 or 3). But for now, for your sanity, and the baby we'll being, starting New Year, he should step out. \n\nI hope you'll read all this because I had to look for many words in English in order to express all that \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdited to stress a point.", "Then you hand him the baby and go upstairs and take a nap for the amount of time you've both agreed he'll stay with the baby, and then when his time is up, he leaves.

I have no problem with seeing him everyday lmao. A lot of people here are assuming that he\u2019s constantly begging me to get back together and that\u2019s not the case. It was back when we first split and i limited contact appropriately but he\u2019s behaving himself now. Contrary to popular belief, people can choose to be friends with their exes for the benefit of their kids. I grew up with divorced parents who did everything by a schedule and it was difficult to deal with. When they eventually became friends again, life got so much easier.

You need some separation for it to sink in for him that it's really over. You see it as him wanting to come see the baby, but it's unlikely that's his only reason for wanting to come over every day. By being there every day he can still play happy family. No one is saying you can't be friends with your ex, but in order for him to truly be your ex you need some time apart.", "The problem is that it seems to be allowing him to remain in denial about the split, and that's not good for either of you or the child.", "Okay, but you realize that failing to push back on long daily visits gives your ex the impression he's on the path to reconciliation with you, right? Establishing boundaries clarifies the fact that you've moved on from him.", "Ehh it seems the husband was the one at fault or op wouldn\u2019t still be divorcing him. He can want to see his kid everyday and I hope he does. But it\u2019s not realistic when you\u2019re not together. Unless he took the kid by himself for a bit but it seems that\u2019s not the case they are all just hanging at Ops home everyday.", "We had a long period of separation. We didn\u2019t speak at all (besides lawyers and divorce stuff) from when i found out i was pregnant till i was seven months along.
