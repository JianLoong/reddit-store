We split after a few years of his mother making my life hell and many miscarriages. Incidentally, i found out i was pregnant two weeks after we split. He begged me to get back together with him and even though i still loved him, i knew that we weren\u2019t going to last. \n\nI had our son this august and we\u2019ve decided to do Christmas together year for him. My ex had also gone NC with his family for the role they played in our split so i don\u2019t want him to be alone during the holidays. He\u2019ll be coming over to my mothers place on Christmas eve and leaving on the 26th as is normal to do in our family for christmas as we open presents on the eve, go to church on the day and then have dinner together that evening. \n\nMy ex also gets along really well with a lot of my male cousins and my older brothers so it hopefully won\u2019t be awkward.\n\n\nNaturally, this situation has been giving me a lot of stress. My ex still wants us to work it out, we\u2019re in the midst of our divorce, i\u2019m suffering from health problems from the birth etc. I\u2019ve been talking about this non-stop with my therapist and she coined the term \u2018co-parent christmas\u2019. I find the term funny and i guess when i put it like that, i can effectively compartmentalise what is stressing me out exactly between general holiday stress or my ex being there. I\u2019ve started using the term with friends and family too.\n\nMy ex came over yesterday to drop off his presents for my family members (my mom likes to get all the presents in her house when she\u2019s hosting by the 22nd so she can organize them properly, we have a huge family) and we discussed the arrangements a little. He comes over daily just to see the baby too because he\u2019s still exclusively breastfed. \n\nI used the term \u2018co-parent christmas\u2019 and he got a funny look on his face but never said anything. Later on, he called me to say that he didn\u2019t like the term as it reminded him of his failure as a husband and how it meant that he didn\u2019t get to experience any sort of family christmas this year. I felt absolutely awful and i even teared up as i apologized. I even lost a little sleep over it and i spoke to my older brother and he said i was an AH for not being mindful over how i spoke to my ex.

You do not need to be \"mindful\" to someone who was not mindful to you. It's not a family christmas because he is not your family. This is merely a consequence to his (lack of) actions. If he's struggling with coming to terms with the fact that he failed as a husband, those feelings are his to manage, not yours. NTA.", "NTA, but do yourself a favor and put some distance between the two of you.  Otherwise OP will continue to be stressed, family will be confused/make assumptions, and the guy will continue to use this \"in\" as a way to push getting back together.", "Setting a boundary that 1) you are getting divorced, and 2) you are no longer a family unit is not inapprpriate.  I get that it may sting for some, but, if said without malice or glee, it is not an inappropriate distinction to make.  \n\n\nYou need to have a conversation with your brother.  My guess is that he disagrees with your decision to divorce.  It would be best for you and he to air out that conversation", "NTA...I like the term!  In the same way you've had to seek help and get your mind around the situation, your ex needs to do the same.  He may have some emotional reaction to the term, but it IS the reality that he needs to face. He too may need to seek help to get through this.", "NTA\n\nI think the term is helpful. You are in the midst of a divorce, your ex wants to get back together, your figuring out what's best for your kid - this term establishes some boundaries. \n\nI wish you a merry Christmas and happy co-parenting year", "NTA, maybe if he had stood up for you when his mother was making your life hell, you'd be a family and not co parents", "NTA, but you're not doing him any favours stringing him along like this. Your kid is not even going to know it's Xmas so it's not worth doing for his sake. Get some distance.", "He did fail? Don't wanna be reminded, don't fail. He f Ed up , he pays the consequences", "NTA, especially from the outside looking in. I can see that it's the first year and you both are too close to the situation to get a good feel for it, but the idea of a \"co-parent christmas\" to me brings the idea of two individuals who are cordial and friendly enough and can communicate even though they can't live in the same house and be a \"couple,\" they can still have a united front for their child(ren). \n\nA team. Being on a team doesn't mean you sleep in the same bed as your teammates every day. You get together for training and games and then go back to your own lives, but when it comes to \"the game\" (in this case, raising a child) you're on the same page and sharing the responsibilities and aren't at each others throats.", "NTA. You and your ex are in different places. You used that term your therapist suggested because it helps you. It is not innately offensive or inappropriate. Your ex is struggling too but you don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. You are already trying to make it work primarily for him - because let's face it, a 4 month old doesn't notice of care if his parents are together for Christmas - and the idea that you have to also put on a whole charade pretending you're a happy family is, to me, a bridge too far. \n\nMore than anything it sounds like you're navigating a tough situation together, and there is a beauty in that. It wasn't fair for him to nitpick your choice of words OR the fact that - indeed - you see it as a coparenting endeavor not a 'happy family' endeavor, and your bro was an AH for choosing to critiicize you over it.", "NTA, he can learn to manage his own delicate fee-fees since he never gave a shit about how his family handled yours.", "Well he was a failure as a husband, so I don't see why you need to tip toe around his feelings.  You are way too enmeshed with your ex.  Either get a divorce and separate or go into marriage therapy and fix it.  This half in half out stuff is just hurting both of you.  You aren't having Christmas together for your son.  Your son isn't even a year old.  Your son doesn't give a fuck.  You are having Christmas together for your ex.  Be honest with yourself.  NTA, but you need to seriously evaluate where you are going in life.", "NAH\n\nLook, there are a lot of sensitivities to be negotiated here. But you are all doing your best. The term is not offensive or intended to be. You are co-parents working out what you need to do  together. Your hormones are still all over from giving birth and you are is a stressful situation. As is he which is why he is over-sensitive. You can't watch over every word.", "NTA.  But I do think it\u2019s weird that your husband is still exclusively breastfed.", "NTA what\u2019s with guys today, is everyone of them just a total child?  You did nothing wrong, and why does the husbands ass need to be kissed every 2 seconds.  Co parent is a reasonable term.  Part of it is the guys refusal to accept reality that the divorce is happening g so he\u2019s freaking out", "Oh fuck that. Your ex did fail and if being reminded of that hurts his widdle feefees he can cry himself a river.\nYou are NTA. \n\nYou are still recovering from being pregnant and childbirth. You are exclusively breastfeeding. You are going through the stress of divorce caused by abusive in-laws and your ex\u2019s failure to protect you and your relationship. Any way you are able to protect yourself and have boundaries is appropriate. \n\nCo-Parent Christmas for the win!", "It is a co-parent Christmas. Your ex isn't your family. It's not your problem he went No Contact with his family after your divorce. It's not your problem that he regrets your divorce. Next year your child will be old enough that you can spilt Christmas. Managing your ex-husband's emotions isn't your responsibility anymore. NTA", "Treat your divorce like a business transaction if you don\u2019t things will get muddy. What kind of parenting plan do you want to have when you\u2019re divorced?  Surely you\u2019re not going to allow daily visits?  What if he or you meet someone else how will that work?  You need to take emotion out of this process. Sorry to be so blunt but good luck with everything.", "I mean, I don't see why you couldn't just call it \"Christmas\" in front of your ex. NAH.\n\nAfter reading your comments, you need to set clear boundaries with your ex. You see him every day. That's not going to change unless you put your foot down.", "It is sad that it took you being emotionally brought down to the point your last straw broke for him to see the damage his family did and go NC. I love the term and think it is a gentle way to relay to him what this means to you. He, wanting to reconcile, could easily take the holiday and the fact that he gets along so well with many in your family to create a false hope that the time will be for reconciliation and building new family memories. He does not like the term because it does not fit his desire to win you back and reminds him of where your heart and head are.  It may hurt a little for him to hear it as it a reminder of what he lost, but to change it back to 'family Christmas' would likely give him a false hope that you are changing your mindset, and he has a chance. Better to give him the mindset of the reality of his symbolic place in your heart and mind so he can enjoy the time with people he gets along really well with, spend time with his son and enjoy being able to co parent with his son's mom and not look everywhere for signs and hope for something you are not able nor willing to give him.", "Could you start expressing milk so he can have one bottle a day so you don\u2019t have to see your ex partner when he comes over? Might make it easier on both of you to get some distance between you", "NTA - aww he still loves you and wants it to work. It\u2019s little therapy nuggets like that - well they feel like distancing tactics. And they are. He expressed how it hurt him, you felt his truth and that\u2019s that -  and just move on from it.", "Quit being a fucking doormat. This \"family christmas\" that is so stressing you out doesn't even need to happen because said baby he claims to be there for is only 4 months and couldnt give a single fuck about christmas if it wanted to. He also doesn't need to come over every day.\n\nGet a custody agreement on file with the court and stick with it. This whole post is a problem of your own making.", "NAH", "NTA. Your ex still thinks that you'll drop the divorce and get back together with him. He needs to understand that that won't happen. I think he wants to spend Christmas with you because he's hoping that it means you're open to reconciliation. That's why he got upset when you said that. But you shouldn't give him false hope; you didn't need to apologize.", "NTA. \n\nYou chose that term because it described your own feelings on the situation. \nHe voiced how it hurt and it seems you understand why, and feel bad about it. \n\nFeel bad for him though. He hasn\u2019t ever really had a family when you think about it. Anyone who would treat your wife like shit doesn\u2019t care much about you, so honestly this is a pretty natural conclusion to things. He will have to build one for himself.", "NAH - no one sucks here. There is no asshole. Just a difficult situation. Everyone is telling you to stop letting him come around so often. They are telling you that your baby won't remember his dad not being there. He will know when he sees the pictures and videos when he is older. You are doing something incredible for your child. You are putting aside your difficulties with your ex to make sure your son has both of his parents in his life. \n\nWhen your son is older he's going to be able to look back and see how his parents put him first and worked together to be good parents even though they weren't a good fit as partners. When you do eventually go to court to get your custody sorted it will also reflect well on you that you made efforts to include his dad even though you were breastfeeding. Breastfeeding does not mean automatic full custody.", "NAH\n\nYou are two imperfect humans with open wounds fumbling around trying to do the right thing, both for yourselves, for each other, and for your kid. Try as you both might, chances are you're both going to say \"ouch\" at least once through all this.", "NTA boundaries and setting them early days can suck.\nI get you trying separate things and frankly he's spending Christmas with his son who is his family so maybe pointing that out might help him feel better.\nI do understand it stinging for him tho but I want to ask, do you think he mentioned it because it feels bad and he would prefer something that doesn't or was it to guilt/ manipulate you? The first is okay but the second is a real issue and I'd suggest waaay more boundaries if you think that's the case.\nBut idk the dude, you do.", "Nta, your therapist recommended the term because is best for your mental health\n\nStop being so concerned about your ex feelings, I bet he didn't care about yours when his family mistreated you \n\nYou are divorced\n\nStart thinking about yourself", "NTA you plan to get back together with your ex.", "NTA: this is about your mental health. Not his. You worry about your mental health first. His comes in dead last. He wasn\u2019t worried about you until you wanted a divorce. \n\nYour top priority (after your mental health) is your son. You are not doing you or your son any favors by doing things that make you uncomfortable. If you start limiting contact with your ex, it will be normal for him growing up. You can\u2019t just go from seeing your ex everyday and every holiday to just not one day just because your child is older. You set those standards now. It\u2019ll be easier. You feel bad for your ex, but ultimately he made decisions to allow his family to treat you like crap for years. He hasn\u2019t earned the term family. \n\nCoparenting Christmas is a great term. Tell your brother to back off.", "NTA but don\u2019t let these people bully you into not allowing your ex the opportunity to bond with his child. It is imperative for that bond to start early for both baby and dad. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that your wellbeing or feelings should be pushed aside or belittled. It\u2019s unfortunate that he felt that way but actions have consequences and some of his previous actions led to this situation you all are facing now. It\u2019s hard and it\u2019s going to continue to be hard and the best thing to do is to focus on what you feel is best for your child and yourself. If that means distancing some from your ex then do that, if that means allowing him to see the baby do that.", "YTA he cut his family off and you basically drew a clear line pointing out that he is the outsider.", "NTA at all. Its good that you are trying to set boundaries. Ignore your asshole brother, he should have your back and make it clear to your ex that that is exactly what this is - co-parent Christmas.\n\nTime to start to distance yourself from your ex. When he visits the baby head out and grab a coffee or go for a walk (take advantage that as a single mother of a baby you can have some 'me time'). Reduce the overlap until its barely there is a good starting step. Get one of those co-parenting apps and put all communications through it. Explain to ex that you just want to keep a healthy boundary between you both as friendly co-parents but not actual friends.\n\nCome up with a plan with your therapist and a lawyer on how you can delicately adjust custody so you aren't seeing your ex every day while also try and prevent being accused of keeping him from the baby by the flying monkeys like your asshole brother.", "YTA", "YTA - It's unnecessarily passive aggressive at best, gaslighting at worst.", "Ya so your family loves your ex obviously. I think they think you'll get back with him and he thinks you will too if he wears you down enough. I in no way think your the ahole here but neither do I think he is. He did take drastic steps to try to get you back which is great but overall not what you want. You shouldn't feel bad about co-parenting. You should see if he would be willing to go to a therapy session with you so you both can discuss and find a way where you're new co-parenting relationship can move forward in a healthy way.

It's a start that he didn't say anything in the moment and called you later. It's an encouraging start that he recognizes that the term makes him feel a certain way, but he needs to keep going with that and dig deeper to get to the root of those feelings. Because that's what he needs to deal with. I can appreciate the regret he has now. And I can emphasize how difficult it must be right now without his family (you and his extended one). Consequences. They can suck. \n\nBut he can't hold your feelings hostage so his don't get hurt. I think a structured parenting agreement will do a world of good. It sounds harsh at first to draw a boundary of, for instance, only communicating about your child and only through a parenting app. However, it actually gives you both room to breathe. And that boundary doesn't always have to be there; it can move and flex with you both. It sounds like you would like to get to a place where the two of you can be friendly and co-parent closely. Being firm now and getting through the hard while your son is too little to know what's going on, may make it easier to get to a friendlier place when he's a bit older. \n\nAnd your brother needs to hush.

You're still sticking to your boundaries regarding the divorce, and that's what's really important. You might suggest co-counseling in the future to help you two communicate in a way that amicable so you have the tools in place for that.

But once the child has moved on from breastfeeding and i would suggest maybe looking at introducing formula (if you can find it, i have heard there have been issues) then using formula to allow your child to visit dad for longer periods is a good way to go. Then you need to work on just having amicable exchanges of the child, at a neutral, mutually agreed upon location.

Meaning he could only have the baby for up to 3 hours at a time.", ">It seems as though this ex is worming his way in deeper and deeper. Also if they didn't like him why would they invite him to Christmas.\n\nThey might like him to make OPs life easier tbf and yeah the brother is a bit of an idiot, and is showing his true colors", "Its not a quack term and it seems like your like OPs ex taking out their anger on people instead of owning your failures", "It's not really even meant to be a term. It's just kind of a play on words to lighten the mood, because it's alliterative and a little funny. It's not supposed to be a clinical term.", "You've got a mental blockage on this one.  Yeesh.", "They're past the 6 week mark, breastfeeding would be fully established by now she could pump and have bottles ready so easily, this would also allow OP to get a babysitter and go out if she so chooses, and if she doesn't trust her ex alone she can have a trusted adult sit in on his visits", "I think you misunderstood. He can have a relationship without having to spend time with OP.", "Tbh it doesn't sound like OP has clearly set boundaries", "But he\u2019s not happy about this divorce which you stated. He was upset by you saying coparent Christmas because it reminds him you don\u2019t want him. He is in denial that you\u2019re divorcing. The holidays is certainly a difficult time for these situations but once they are over you need distance. Otherwise why are you so concerned if you don\u2019t want him back?", "I would take back the apology you gave as you arent the reason for him feeling bad. Its on him because he caused the situation to become this way. He needs to deal with that himself instead of putting that on you.", "Question. If you split because of his family but now he\u2019s NC with them, then what\u2019s the reason you\u2019ve decided to stay split, since the reason for the split is no longer in the picture right?", "Again as I said that\u2019s still not seeing her ex every day is it? Plenty of other parents that are split up with breastfeeding babies manage it just fine. This is clearly affecting both op and ex and it\u2019s been proven this can also affect babies. In my case my now 2 year old cried every time his dad would start having a go at me, this turned into him sending when I was stressed after we split when my ex would send me harassing messages and my son would cry then. There\u2019s even co-parenting courses that state that even if you don\u2019t argue in front of the child or baby they can still sense somethings going on. Even if he wants to see their baby every day she can drop baby to someone else\u2019s to do hand over every other day. It cuts down the amount of time op and ex have to see each other because this is clearly affecting both of them mentally and that\u2019s not good for them or the baby. There\u2019s plenty of ways to do it. Doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s breastfeeding, go to someone mutuals house and time it so he picks baby up just after a feed and brings back just before. It really isn\u2019t hard to co-parent and not have to see each other all of the time. Social services didn\u2019t want my ex to be around me (loads of issues I won\u2019t go into) so there was a third party there for handover all the time until he completely stopped seeing our son. There is literally no excuse to not explore other options even with a breastfed baby. If he has to see the baby every day there are many options out there even with breastfed babies. Up until my ex had to be supervised with our son 3rd parties did hand over whilst I was in a completely different room. There are ways around it easily. I know you\u2019re not op but I hope op sees because there are tonnes upon tonnes of options there.", "He doesnt get to blame OP for the situation he caused it by his lack of stoping his mother's harassment. It is maliciousness to blame OP for using the term co parent christmas as a reminder of his failures. They are his failures not hers he does not get to put that on her", "> Or he genuinely wants to see his child?\n\nThen he'll be just fine if OP leaves the child with him for a while and goes to do something else.  Even if she's breastfeeding and has to stay close by, she can go in another room and do whatever.", "The mil wasnt the Problem, the ex was.", "I think for me though is why you apologized. You didnt cause this divorce his lack of action to rein in his mother is a cause of it. You shouldnt allow him to blame you", "It sounds like you're working on a way to balance parenting time for your son. I think what you missed is one of the greatest benefits of divorce: you do not have to do any emotional labour for your former spouse. He was upset when you used a very neutral term: co-parent Christmas. He can have emotions about that but they are his emotions to deal with. He could consider therapy to help him but you are definitely not his therapist nor responsible for his feelings. And it sounds like your male relatives feel bad for him. But they don't get to scold you. They can put that energy into supporting your ex if they really care about him. But hey, that's harder then just telling you it's your fault. All the best to you! It is a challenge being a single parent. Get solid, enforceable legal agreements for co-parenting time and child support. Believe me, it will make all of your lives a lot easier.", "I\u2019m not saying go to war with him. I\u2019m saying give both of you some healthy boundaries so you can start to process and mourn and heal from the breakup.", "No it\u2019s a quack term. Co-parenting, co-Christmas!!!!\nSorry, doing what us best for your child is called PARENTING. Plan and simple. Divorce means shit, if you have kids you need to be a parent and learn to get along and live them. That\u2019s called parenting, and loving your kid(s). Not co-parenting but parenting.", "Yes, \"I want a divorce\" followed by getting divided is incredibly unclear \ud83d\ude44", "I mean, after putting up with it for years, the family is no longer the problem, the husband is the problem. If he didn't stop their behaviour until OP had already left, then he didn't care enough to do it beforehand.", "I totally agree!\n\nBut its unfair to say hes only using the baby to get close to OP.", "I'm not saying that the husband is not at fault. I'm saying its unfair to assume that the only reason he wants to see the baby is because he's trying to manipulate OP.", "I mean, he cut out his family (still, it would seem, as he is alone at Xmas), not sure what else you want of the guy. Besides, none of that would make the guy a bad father or undeserving of seeing his son", "OP seems to be in denial about the fact that her ex wants to reconcile and refuses to acknowledge that the constant visits are not helping with his fantasy, nor is it helping her and her emotional wellbeing. Idk why she says it's reveling in discord when all people are doing is pointing out that she's STILL prioritising his feelings.", "Again what you dont seem to understand is that OPs ex is still trying to get back together with her even after the divorce. He is not understanding that they are no longer together. The term is being used so that he knows not to get his hopes up. They have a kid together by they are not longer husband and wife. \n\nYou seem to need help so get it"]}
