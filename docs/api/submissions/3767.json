I was sick of working a job with long hours with no thanks for it. I baked whenever I was off and sold it sometimes and it took off. After being miserable for years and long discussions with my husband, we decided I should at least try and follow baking full time. I did this for a year and I had relative success but could not keep up with the demand of just selling from out of the house. It was a huge gamble but we decided to open a bakery by renting out a retail unit and investing our life savings. It finally paid off and after five years, it\u2019s a successful small business and we\u2019ve actually made our money back. I run a small shop with 6 staff and I am a lot happier.\n\nMy bakery has a dining area for customers. We do the standard treats like cakes etc. but also morning rolls, sandwiches. I have also hosted local events in conjunction with local groups. For example, stuff like holding knitting nights, crafting nights etc. I\u2019ll either stay open a little later or allow them specific time slots. I do this all for free as it\u2019s a space for people to enjoy something and meet people and they always buy cakes and treats so it\u2019s not hurting anybody. Basically, if it\u2019s reasonable I don\u2019t mind holding events or promoting specific events via flyers or stuff but I will not let other people sell in here. My bakery is solely there to sell things from my bakery and I do not wish to have other businesses trying to solicit sales from within mine.\n\nMy sister has got into making crystals and jewellery. She is not having much luck and has told me it is her \u2018destiny\u2019 to do this after taking some classes. Anyway, she has asked if she can promote her business within my cafe. She wants to show samples and try and get some sales. I told her no and she says I\u2019m a hypocrite as I let other people host things in my bakery. I told her they are local events to bring the community together, most often people who are lonely and that if I ever promote or support a local cause or business, it\u2019s via by displaying flyers inside or over social media or something. None of this involves them selling stuff from my bakery.\n\nI also emphasised that the hobby groups only buy food sometimes and they come with crafting items or stuff and to meet with friends. Also emphasised my belief in supporting local businesses by displaying adverts for them but there\u2019s a difference between doing that and allowing them to sell in my premises.\n\nShe says I\u2019m a heartless AH who is not willing to help out another local business owner and advance her dream. My husband thinks she is delusional. My parents are on my back asking me to break my rule just once so my sister can reach more potential customers.\n\nETA: I did offer to display a poster/flyer for my sister if she had one to promote her but she refused. Idk if it\u2019s relevant but she quit her job as a lawyer to follow this dream. She was a very successful one but said she was miserable working her cases and was willing to sacrifice the pay for her happiness.  I do love and support her trying to make a career change, I just don\u2019t want her selling in my premises. She is 42 btw and I\u2019m 39F. Perhaps there\u2019s a little bit of resentment she\u2019s trying to do what I did and she isn\u2019t having success but idk.\n\nETA 2: idk if it\u2019s relevant but my sister worked in criminal law. Very well paid job and she was extremely successful at it but the cases were very heavy sometimes and it drained on her. She is also trying to launch a legitimate business, not an MLM I don\u2019t think. I think she just wants to try and make a crafting business that stemmed from liking the classes she took run by a legitimate local hobby group. I also did not ask her any legal advice related to my business as it\u2019s a completely different field to what she has experience in.", "created_utc": 1669993517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaoj9j/aita_for_not_helping_to_advance_my_sisters_dream/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People entering a bakery are most likely not there shopping for jewelry.", "As a customer, I get really annoyed to be solicited at a store to buy thing totally unrelated to the store. Don't do it. It could impact your business negativity. NTA", "NTA I am all for your sister having a business and I am sure you are too, but I don\u2019t think promoting something that has NOTHING to do with your business is a good idea.", "NTA as long as you\u2019re consistent. You allow community events but no external sales. As long as you\u2019re not allowing any other sellers in your bakery, then you are not in the wrong \ud83d\ude4c", "NTA.  As a potential customer walking into a bakery I would view having someone try to pressure me into buying unrelated items would be a huge turn-off.  There may also be some regulatory concerns, where I live you would need a different business license to operate as a bakery than you would need to sell arts and crafts retail.", "NTA. This just sounds exhausting.", "NTA - To quote the great Biggie Smalls \n\n>7, this rule is so underrated\nKeep your family and business completely separated", "NTA You'll only risk driving your customers away if you start trying to flog them jewellery.   Nice bread and crystals do not match.  You'd risk making your business look tacky and opportunistic.", "NTA- she's taking her angry about her lack of business out on you. You're not obligated to have her sell her products in your store", "NTA. You, as the owner of the bakery, make the rules and they're consistent: nothing for sale from outside businesses. Makes sense. Personally, I would never buy crystals or craft jewellery (ever, but that's just me) from a bakery. In fact, if a bakery sold that stuff, I wouldn't buy food from it either.  Your sister's dream is hers. She has to work hard to achieve it, just as you did for your bakery.", "Definitely NTA. I am not sure what she's expecting to do (like set up a table and try to talk to everyone who comes in, or hold an \"event\"?) but the last thing I'd want when going into a bakery is have someone trying to sell me something. I tend to avoid places with pushy sales folk (not sure if she'd be pushy or not, but just how I picture it). \n\nI think setting up flyers or sharing advertisements online is good enough, or maybe putting some on display and if people comment on it being pretty or ask about it - you could promote her, share a business card, etc. \n\nIf she had small items, like small necklaces or something - I may potentially offer to have a few on display to sell in shop if I got a % of the profits but meh, you're obviously not obligated to do that.", "Nta. Firstly im guessing she doesnt have a business licence or registry and probably isn't paying taxes etc and of course im sure she has nonintent to pay a portion of your store expenses for rent utilities etc  ... and by allowing her to piggyback/mooch in your space you may be violating your lease, your business insurance etc and exposing yourself to liability. Plus it will not only potentially cost you your customer base/sales because not only will many not appreciate being hounded to buy her doodads with their morning muffin but some customers will then demand you to allow them to promote/sell from your store as well. And finally...your store your rules. She is welcome to set up a table at Dunkin Donuts and see how they respond or she can do what many crafters do and research local markets and fairs and PAY to have a table to display her wares and take orders.", "NTA- and just tell parent \"no\" as parents who have raised children to adulthood, they ought to know well the danger that lies with \"breaking a rule just once\". Further- sister's reaction was uncalled for and if nothing else- I absolutely will take no part in rewarding that behavior.  Finally, as a successful entrepreneur I believe I know what is in the best interest of my business and the community that supports it. The pressure to counter that is at best disrespectful. Any more pressure would simply be adding insult to injury. So if you guys want to intervene then I suggest it should be to sister and explain how it was ok for her to make the request but that she needs to take the response maturely and respect my decision- and that she should apologize for her insults.", "NTA You are advancing your own dream. Your business is  not there to provide retail space for others. You can't/shouldn't make an exception for her as it would have a negative impact on your credibility and reputation in the", "NTA. Your decisions are logical and you are not required to upset the stability of your hard-won success for your sister's jewelry.", "NTA- if I walk into a bakery and some weird lady tries to sell me a Smokey quartz to bring balance to my life or some woohoo like that, I would never come back lol", "NTA, your sister's \"business\" is going nowhere and allowing her to peddle her twoddle in your store will drive customers away", "NTA. If aomeone was \"promoting\" their jewelry while I was trying to have a sandwich and a cup of coffee, I  would be pretty annoyed and never step foot in the shop again.\n\nPeople do not want a hard sell ever and they don't go to a bakery to buy jewelry. \n\nEven if she just wants to display some jewlery for sale, it looks tacky to do this and devalues your business to customers. You can tell when a business was pressured into doing something like this for a SO/family member/friend. They have the little display by the register w/ some random jewlery. Patrons wonder what the focus is. Is this business really about making good food or are they focused on selling this random jewlery?\n\nThere are craft fairs, street fairs, and stores that put this type of thing up for a commission, etc. Your sister needs to do the legwork and make the connections to get her stuff displayed in appropriate venues.\n\nThe reality is that she should have been hustling to get into one of the hundreds of Christmas craft fairs that pop-up this time of year.", "NTA. Its your store. You can do whatever you want. She can take her \"destinity\" attention grab somewhere else.", "NTA. You have a consistent policy. Maybe she could do a free community event around jewelry making where she could show off her skills through teaching others to gain name recognition? You\u2019d have to decide if her sharing her info about herself and business as part of it (but not selling right there) might be something you\u2019d be okay with.", "NTA \n\nAs a customer and someone solicits me for something unrelated to the restaurant I went to, I stop doing business there.

Then you have a flea market instead of a bakery.\n\nAnyway, it's apples and oranges.  Baked goods are bought by nearly everyone. Jewelry and crystals is a niche market, much harder to sell.

You have worked hard to make your bakery profitable. You have made it clear you allow small groups to gather in your bakery, that is part of your service to your business plan and community.\n\nYour sister and parents asking you to let her poorly planned out business piggy back on your hard work is absurd. Tell your sister to seek professional help with her business plan. There are groups that support new small businesses (like SCORE in the US) otherwise she may have to go back to being a lawyer to support her hobby. \n\nEither way it's not your problem.

Other creatives will want to sell paintings or photos, and on and on. Each of them will cite your having let one vendor in, and when you tell these others no, they will start talking shit about how unfair you are. \n\nThis is a sure fire way to ruin your reputation. If your sister wants to succeed, she can work from home, create an online shop on Etsy or other platforms, she can go to craft shows, farmers markets, or other general sells venues. She can get in touch with other local businesses that are in a similar line or have customers interested in similar products. She can leverage the network effect to build momentum. People buying cakes and treats aren\u2019t in the mood to shop for jewelry. Different purchase mindsets. \n\nYour sister is trying to shortcut the long road that it takes to build a business. If this is her passion and destiny, then nothing you, op, do can stop it or help it. Destinies happen regardless. It sounds like your sister has a case of difficulty equaling diversity. That thought that says, \u201cI put in the time and effort and did one hard thing, therefore other hard things will come without cost because I\u2019ve already paid my dues.\u201d Nope. \n\nNTA.

I ask because many MLM's teach their recruits to behave this way toward anyone who says \"no\" to them.  Using words like \"her dream\" and \"her destiny\" reek of MLM-speak, too.", "NTA. Your sister is barking up the wrong tree. I could see if she got into making chocolate, or roasting coffee or something that complements your business that you could purchase from her to resell, and promote, but asking you to carry a wildly different product, and presumably manage it, is out of line.\n\nIn your case, I'm imagining you getting the blame from her and your parents because her jewelry is not flying off the shelf, and what are you going to do about it?

She has not started mentioning a specific business or anything. From what I\u2019ve seen, she took a few classes hosted by a well known hobby group in our area and she found she likes it and is trying to go off on her own. Yes, I find her choice of words a bit weird but I\u2019m willing to give her some slack. No, she isn\u2019t a malicious person so idk if she\u2019s stressed or what.", "Additionally\u2026 I mean its like\u2026 really childish to expect to take off with self made jewelry and crystals.

I completely understand. I also completely agree with your policy.

I'd imagine if you let her have a display stand within the year you'll be her primary retail space through consistent family pressure. Best to cap that now.", "It was suggested but she rejected it", "Yea I still maintain you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s unreasonable for her to expect you to make an exception.
