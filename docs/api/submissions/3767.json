I was sick of working a job with long hours with no thanks for it. I baked whenever I was off and sold it sometimes and it took off. After being miserable for years and long discussions with my husband, we decided I should at least try and follow baking full time. I did this for a year and I had relative success but could not keep up with the demand of just selling from out of the house. It was a huge gamble but we decided to open a bakery by renting out a retail unit and investing our life savings. It finally paid off and after five years, it\u2019s a successful small business and we\u2019ve actually made our money back. I run a small shop with 6 staff and I am a lot happier.\n\nMy bakery has a dining area for customers. We do the standard treats like cakes etc. but also morning rolls, sandwiches. I have also hosted local events in conjunction with local groups. For example, stuff like holding knitting nights, crafting nights etc. I\u2019ll either stay open a little later or allow them specific time slots. I do this all for free as it\u2019s a space for people to enjoy something and meet people and they always buy cakes and treats so it\u2019s not hurting anybody. Basically, if it\u2019s reasonable I don\u2019t mind holding events or promoting specific events via flyers or stuff but I will not let other people sell in here. My bakery is solely there to sell things from my bakery and I do not wish to have other businesses trying to solicit sales from within mine.\n\nMy sister has got into making crystals and jewellery. She is not having much luck and has told me it is her \u2018destiny\u2019 to do this after taking some classes. Anyway, she has asked if she can promote her business within my cafe. She wants to show samples and try and get some sales. I told her no and she says I\u2019m a hypocrite as I let other people host things in my bakery. I told her they are local events to bring the community together, most often people who are lonely and that if I ever promote or support a local cause or business, it\u2019s via by displaying flyers inside or over social media or something. None of this involves them selling stuff from my bakery.\n\nI also emphasised that the hobby groups only buy food sometimes and they come with crafting items or stuff and to meet with friends. Also emphasised my belief in supporting local businesses by displaying adverts for them but there\u2019s a difference between doing that and allowing them to sell in my premises.\n\nShe says I\u2019m a heartless AH who is not willing to help out another local business owner and advance her dream. My husband thinks she is delusional. My parents are on my back asking me to break my rule just once so my sister can reach more potential customers.\n\nETA: I did offer to display a poster/flyer for my sister if she had one to promote her but she refused. Idk if it\u2019s relevant but she quit her job as a lawyer to follow this dream. She was a very successful one but said she was miserable working her cases and was willing to sacrifice the pay for her happiness.  I do love and support her trying to make a career change, I just don\u2019t want her selling in my premises. She is 42 btw and I\u2019m 39F. Perhaps there\u2019s a little bit of resentment she\u2019s trying to do what I did and she isn\u2019t having success but idk.\n\nETA 2: idk if it\u2019s relevant but my sister worked in criminal law. Very well paid job and she was extremely successful at it but the cases were very heavy sometimes and it drained on her. She is also trying to launch a legitimate business, not an MLM I don\u2019t think. I think she just wants to try and make a crafting business that stemmed from liking the classes she took run by a legitimate local hobby group. I also did not ask her any legal advice related to my business as it\u2019s a completely different field to what she has experience in.", "created_utc": 1669993517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaoj9j/aita_for_not_helping_to_advance_my_sisters_dream/", "score": 1916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally, I would never buy crystals or craft jewellery (ever, but that's just me) from a bakery. In fact, if a bakery sold that stuff, I wouldn't buy food from it either.

Firstly im guessing she doesnt have a business licence or registry and probably isn't paying taxes etc and of course im sure she has nonintent to pay a portion of your store expenses for rent utilities etc  ... and by allowing her to piggyback/mooch in your space you may be violating your lease, your business insurance etc and exposing yourself to liability. Plus it will not only potentially cost you your customer base/sales because not only will many not appreciate being hounded to buy her doodads with their morning muffin but some customers will then demand you to allow them to promote/sell from your store as well.

Further- sister's reaction was uncalled for and if nothing else- I absolutely will take no part in rewarding that behavior.  Finally, as a successful entrepreneur I believe I know what is in the best interest of my business and the community that supports it. The pressure to counter that is at best disrespectful. Any more pressure would simply be adding insult to injury.

Patrons wonder what the focus is. Is this business really about making good food or are they focused on selling this random jewlery?\n\nThere are craft fairs, street fairs, and stores that put this type of thing up for a commission, etc. Your sister needs to do the legwork and make the connections to get her stuff displayed in appropriate venues.\n\nThe reality is that she should have been hustling to get into one of the hundreds of Christmas craft fairs that pop-up this time of year.", "NTA.

Each step you maintained and income rather than just quitting your job and expecting instant success. \n\nYour sister should be working at least a few cases to support herself(at a lower standard of living than a Criminal attorney would normally make), saving up as much money as she can while she builds up her reputation and clientele for her crystals business.

Would I do this for my sister if she is struggling ? I would, in a heartbeat.", "Your story made me cringe as it reminded me of an incident I had earlier this year.  I was on a Spring break trip with my kids, my bestie and my niece (bestie's daughter). One night we stopped at a family owned Italian restaurant after looking at online reviews.  We were waiting to be seated and as we were waiting we saw a display case near the cash register area. We went over to take a look and realized it was handmade jewelry with price tags and some laminated photos with other jewelry samples and the name of the maker and his info.  My niece, a blunt person who sometimes forgets to think before speaking, blurted out \"Who sells jewelry at a restaurant? Thats so tacky!\" I privately agreed, but had the sense to keep it to myself. \n\nThe young lady at the register (which also doubled as reception area) looked very offended. She proceeded to tell us that the designer was her relative (her uncle if remember correctly) who was a veteran and because of Covid had fallen on hard times. My niece did apologize. Me and bestie made small talk with the woman as bestie is a retired disabled vet,and im also a veteran and married to retired vet. Long story short, we end up buying 3 of the pieces, totaling $70. Tbh, it wasn't because we actually wanted them. They were pretty, but I could've gotten something similar for cheaper online. We bought them,  because a) the young lady had been offended  by niece's out burst b) we wanted to support a fellow vet,  and c) we were too tired to go looking for another restaurant that evening and we didn't want to risk something being done to our food. Especially since the restaurant was a family owned one. \n\nIdk what bestie did with her pieces, but i ended up gifting the butterfly-esque pendant I bought to a  classmate of my son on a necklace chain (bought separately from a local store). My son has autism and the girl is similar.  They've been classmates for years. I did have to explain the story of the pendant to her parents though. I didn't want them to misunderstand why my son was giving their daughter \"jewelry\". (I do have a daughter but she's older and has never liked wearing jewelry. And the pendant was more youthful, like fairy or princessy type feel.)", "*She says I\u2019m a heartless AH who is not willing to help out another local business owner*\n\n**She's manipulating you** here, **insulting you**, and basically **showing you that you cannot rely on her to tell the truth**.  You aren't heartless, you have boundaries.  You are NTA, and are willing to help out, but your help is limited by your reasonable boundaries to protect your business. \n\n *and advance her dream.* \n\nThat's her job, not yours.  **You are not supposed to do her work for her.**  \n\nShe can look around and talk to business owners that sell things that are going to draw in a crowd for similar products.  She can go to craft fairs, look into online sales, and see if local \"gift\" shop owners might set up a cute little display with her products, for a percentage.  \n\n**It's not your job to use your business to promote hers.  That's like she wants to ride on your coattails, not make her own success, if she wants to use your space, your publicity, your sales people, your building,** etc.  She's trying to use you, and is probably not looking to pay rent for the privilege.  Very manipulative.\n\n*My husband thinks she is delusional.* \n\nYep.  She wants it, and thinks that is reason enough to try to force your compliance.  **Sounds like someone to protect yourself from, not someone to invite into your business space.**  I think your offer of a poster is reasonable and as far as you can safely go with this.  And she turned it down.  That's really interesting, because it makes me think she was thinking more of setting up a kiosk and having you pay for the overhead and staffing, not her.  As her taking up space in your building would also mean less seating for your own customers, it would have an effect on your success.  That's not how good business works, to stab your own foot.\n\n*My parents are on my back asking me to break my rule just once so my sister can reach more potential customers.*\n\n**They are wrong.**  Chances are you would lose customers, not her gain them, if you suddenly are selling something unrelated to your own products.  \n\n**They are wrong to insist that you subsidize her business by letting her invade yours.**  Have they looked into the overhead costs, the staffing, the rent that she would need to pay to have her stuff at your business?  Have they considered that for her to make any profit, she would need to sell X number of items per day, just to cover your costs for having her invade your space and use your building and staff?  \n\n**They are wrong to interfere in your business.**  You have good plans and instincts, and your customers appreciate your place like it is.  You are reasonable to not mess with what is working for you. \n\n**Sounds like your parents are easily swayed by what your sister wants.**  \n\nIt's okay to tell them, next time any of them bring this up, **that you \"aren't discussing this again.\"**  **You have made your decision about this, made an offer, that offer was refused, and therefore there is nothing else to discuss.**  You don't have to say this all, just say that you aren't discussing it again.  And if they won't respect this, hang up, end the conversation, or walk out.\n\n**Your sister's success is her own to achieve.  You can't give this to her.**  She needs to work for it.

She quit her job before it was realistic and put all her eggs in this crafting basket, which was a really bad idea (and probably a big factor contributing to her stress right now).\n\nIf you\u2019re open to helping her, but just not in the way she\u2019s asking, making suggestions for other ways you can help might make her feel a bit more supported, ease her stress so that she\u2019ll lay off of you, and keep your relationship in a good place.", "NTA. Not a good idea to mix business and family. Tell her to sell online, make up business cards with the crystals as a background picture and the website and have businesses carry her cards.

Explain that, and tell everyone the discussion is done. No more.

It's your shop, and you cultivate the atmosphere that you want.  And you are not treating your sister any differently than any other local business.  Your suggestion to put up a free advertisement for her products was completely reasonable and your sister is a huge entitled AH for refusing this.\n\nYour sister made a really stupid life choice, she is jealous of your success, and wants you to save her from her mistake.  Unless your sister has the skills of a professional jeweler, which is a serious form of art and one that people train for years to get good at, she has no hope of making a living doing this.  And if she did have the skills of a professional jeweler, she would be selling her products in jewelry stores.\n\nHowever, would your business really be negatively affected by having one little stand in the corner that has some jewelry for customers to look through?  Maybe the answer is yes.  Maybe it would severely disrupt your business or destroy the atmosphere you are trying to create, in which case, put your foot down.

Also, your sister sounds jealous and needs to have a reality check, quitting your job outright to make jewelry is not the same as slowly building a food service business as you have. Sure, you took a risk, but I don't think it's super typical for homemade jewelry businesses to get big enough to replace a full time job- it's quite hard to compete with the quality of luxury shops, or with the production speed of mass produced fast fashion lines.

You set your boundary that you only sell items from your business, hold that boundary OP!", "NTA. You have a local business that hosts local fun events. If she's REALLY gonna make it as a business owner, why doesn't she think creatively about a fun event she can host at your bakery? Instead of badgering you to do things \"her\" way?", "NTA. \n\nYour business, your rules. \n\nAnd yes, there is a difference between hosting a social event and displaying other people\u2019s products permanently. \n\n\nPlus: Let\u2019s be honest: Who is looking for jewelry in a bakery? I would find it very odd and probably assume that it\u2019s not high quality. \n\nI would buy anything food or bakery related in the bakery. Because this is their area of expertise, so I assume that the food or bakery-related products the bakery displays are very likely high quality. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t buy jewelry in a bakery just as much as I wouldn\u2019t buy shoes or clothes in a bakery or as I wouldn\u2019t buy cakes in a shoe store. \n\n\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t go together, does she not see that? \n\nPlus, if there\u2019s already arguments here, be prepared to a lot more if you actually really worked together. Better keep that separated \ud83d\ude48.", "NTA well done in succeeding with your bakery and giving your sister sone good advice. Maybe she could try Legal Novels - courtroom dramas perhaps. Much easier to stand out with if they're good.", "NTA", "NTA you decide....full stop", "She could do real estate law or draft wills and avoid 95% of that stress she had.  I'm a family law attorney and understand stress.  \nYour family's arguments for selling crystals & jewellery in your bakery are just nonsense. Let her go to some craft shows or artisan markets.   \nShe's not another local business owner, if she was, she could sell jewellery from her office.  Your parents need to butt out; you two are not in grammar school any longer.  \nCongrats on your business and marriage.", "NTA\n\nEtsy is right over there if she needs a storefront and she can make an advertisement flyer for it once it's set up.  She can reach a lot more people via the internet than she could through your shop alone.", "Sister can launch anything SHE can manage.  See how HER responsibility to HER craft is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.  Let her sink or swim on her own.  She didn't LIKE what you suggested, now SHE can make it work by herself.  **NTA**", "I know! You would think that\u2019s the obvious route when wanting to make a buck off of crafts/art/hobby talents. \n\nNTA, OP. Instead, have her set up her Etsy account and have her put flyers up \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nIf people truly want what she\u2019s selling, this would be the best way. Not by stumbling over her display case while ordering gingerbread cupcakes in your shop.", "Just an FYI, your sis should know that getting into trinkets is tough, much tougher than baked goods. Not saying it's impossible, just that it'll take a while to get anywhere. I do find it a bit concerning that she quit being a lawyer where she was making a load of money to do this. I'm not saying she's wrong to do so, but it would've been far smarter to start doing this as a side gig and build it up to full time gradually. But maybe she hated her job so much that she really needed to quit. I don't know. I just think she could be going about this in a better way.", "She knows her business will fail and is preemptively looking to soften the blow by blaming OP for \u201cblocking her dreams\u201d. Sister is a piece of work", "I sell jewelry but I do it through a local art shop that has several artist\u2019s work on display.", "the jewelers who sell out make those clay earrings and I  am sure others are learning and will fill up that market too", "NTA", "Maybe you could put out a few of her jewelery in a smaller glassed display frame with her ad as decoration where it looks good, in the main area or at the ladies restroom - in a way that it\u2019s not intrusive but blends in with the surroundings. If someone is interested, can take a look and ask about it/check her website but noone feels pushed into buying stuff (which would repel people)", "NTA. As a customer, I wouldn't expect other businesses to be actively trying to sell me stuff when I visited a local caf\u00e9/bakery - in fact it would make me feel quite uncomfortable. Your bakery isn't a market place, and your customers wouldn't expect that and might be put off. Flyers or adverts on a community noticeboard seem fine however - much less intrusive. I suppose it's worth considering if there are any other ways you can help or advise her, but stick to your guns on the no selling rule - if you allow her to set up shop in your premises even the once, you might be setting a precedent - will other sellers expect the same treatment? Will she become a permanent fixture?", "If she is not directly competing with you. Then there shouldn't be a problem. Working together actually could be more beneficial to both of you bringing more customers in.", "If I went into a bakery to enjoy some baked wheat and have a quiet moment only for the owner's sister to begin harassing me to buy her magic rocks I would not come back. NTA.", "NTA. I don't mind flyers/posters or even jewelry for sale on display around the bakery. I would absolutely hate though to be approached by someone trying to sell me something. that's a huge NO for me. I would never go back to a place that does that. I come to drink coffee and eat cake, not figuring out polite ways to turn down someone's sale offer.\n\neither way, your business,  your rules.", "I second this. I won\u2019t go into to details because my dad is a very private person but he went into business with my uncle, his sister husband. Flash forward about 20 years and it got so bad business wise that my dad doesn\u2019t talk to his sister anymore ( not like they talk a lot before) and has basically disowned her as a sister. Same goes for my uncle. This doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t care about his sister but that the relationship is just too damaged for them to talk. I still talk to her on my birthday and her\u2019s but that\u2019s it. So, yeah don\u2019t go into business with family members.", "I have seen this work in a bakery.  There was a separate area as you walk in to look at jewelry, prints and gift items that have an overall theme.  A separate pay station is set up with an iPad.  You let one of the workers know if you want to purchase something.  I\u2019ve gotten a few things.  Multiple artists contribute.  However, this is what works for this bakery.  OP has made it clear they want to keep things less complicated and has the same rules for everyone.  The space to display jewelry may not make sense for their setup.  There are other places sister can sell jewelry.  Etsy, art fair, holiday booth, farmers market etc."]}
