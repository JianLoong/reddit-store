I was sick of working a job with long hours with no thanks for it. I baked whenever I was off and sold it sometimes and it took off. After being miserable for years and long discussions with my husband, we decided I should at least try and follow baking full time. I did this for a year and I had relative success but could not keep up with the demand of just selling from out of the house. It was a huge gamble but we decided to open a bakery by renting out a retail unit and investing our life savings. It finally paid off and after five years, it\u2019s a successful small business and we\u2019ve actually made our money back. I run a small shop with 6 staff and I am a lot happier.\n\nMy bakery has a dining area for customers. We do the standard treats like cakes etc. but also morning rolls, sandwiches. I have also hosted local events in conjunction with local groups. For example, stuff like holding knitting nights, crafting nights etc. I\u2019ll either stay open a little later or allow them specific time slots. I do this all for free as it\u2019s a space for people to enjoy something and meet people and they always buy cakes and treats so it\u2019s not hurting anybody. Basically, if it\u2019s reasonable I don\u2019t mind holding events or promoting specific events via flyers or stuff but I will not let other people sell in here. My bakery is solely there to sell things from my bakery and I do not wish to have other businesses trying to solicit sales from within mine.\n\nMy sister has got into making crystals and jewellery. She is not having much luck and has told me it is her \u2018destiny\u2019 to do this after taking some classes. Anyway, she has asked if she can promote her business within my cafe. She wants to show samples and try and get some sales. I told her no and she says I\u2019m a hypocrite as I let other people host things in my bakery. I told her they are local events to bring the community together, most often people who are lonely and that if I ever promote or support a local cause or business, it\u2019s via by displaying flyers inside or over social media or something. None of this involves them selling stuff from my bakery.\n\nI also emphasised that the hobby groups only buy food sometimes and they come with crafting items or stuff and to meet with friends. Also emphasised my belief in supporting local businesses by displaying adverts for them but there\u2019s a difference between doing that and allowing them to sell in my premises.\n\nShe says I\u2019m a heartless AH who is not willing to help out another local business owner and advance her dream. My husband thinks she is delusional. My parents are on my back asking me to break my rule just once so my sister can reach more potential customers.\n\nETA: I did offer to display a poster/flyer for my sister if she had one to promote her but she refused. Idk if it\u2019s relevant but she quit her job as a lawyer to follow this dream. She was a very successful one but said she was miserable working her cases and was willing to sacrifice the pay for her happiness.  I do love and support her trying to make a career change, I just don\u2019t want her selling in my premises. She is 42 btw and I\u2019m 39F. Perhaps there\u2019s a little bit of resentment she\u2019s trying to do what I did and she isn\u2019t having success but idk.\n\nETA 2: idk if it\u2019s relevant but my sister worked in criminal law. Very well paid job and she was extremely successful at it but the cases were very heavy sometimes and it drained on her. She is also trying to launch a legitimate business, not an MLM I don\u2019t think. I think she just wants to try and make a crafting business that stemmed from liking the classes she took run by a legitimate local hobby group. I also did not ask her any legal advice related to my business as it\u2019s a completely different field to what she has experience in.", "created_utc": 1669993517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaoj9j/aita_for_not_helping_to_advance_my_sisters_dream/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally, I would never buy crystals or craft jewellery (ever, but that's just me) from a bakery. In fact, if a bakery sold that stuff, I wouldn't buy food from it either.

Firstly im guessing she doesnt have a business licence or registry and probably isn't paying taxes etc and of course im sure she has nonintent to pay a portion of your store expenses for rent utilities etc  ... and by allowing her to piggyback/mooch in your space you may be violating your lease, your business insurance etc and exposing yourself to liability. Plus it will not only potentially cost you your customer base/sales because not only will many not appreciate being hounded to buy her doodads with their morning muffin but some customers will then demand you to allow them to promote/sell from your store as well.

Further- sister's reaction was uncalled for and if nothing else- I absolutely will take no part in rewarding that behavior.  Finally, as a successful entrepreneur I believe I know what is in the best interest of my business and the community that supports it. The pressure to counter that is at best disrespectful. Any more pressure would simply be adding insult to injury.

Patrons wonder what the focus is. Is this business really about making good food or are they focused on selling this random jewlery?\n\nThere are craft fairs, street fairs, and stores that put this type of thing up for a commission, etc. Your sister needs to do the legwork and make the connections to get her stuff displayed in appropriate venues.\n\nThe reality is that she should have been hustling to get into one of the hundreds of Christmas craft fairs that pop-up this time of year.", "NTA.

Then you went from home based sales to a bakery.  Each step you maintained and income rather than just quitting your job and expecting instant success. \n\nYour sister should be working at least a few cases to support herself(at a lower standard of living than a Criminal attorney would normally make), saving up as much money as she can while she builds up her reputation and clientele for her crystals business.  Then when she has a firm handle on her business and how to make an income with it she can phase out her criminal practice and live off income from business and her savings.\n\nALL WITHOUT HASSLING YOU.", "NTA. Would I do this for my sister if she is struggling ? I would, in a heartbeat.", "Your story made me cringe as it reminded me of an incident I had earlier this year.  I was on a Spring break trip with my kids, my bestie and my niece (bestie's daughter). One night we stopped at a family owned Italian restaurant after looking at online reviews.  We were waiting to be seated and as we were waiting we saw a display case near the cash register area. We went over to take a look and realized it was handmade jewelry with price tags and some laminated photos with other jewelry samples and the name of the maker and his info.  My niece, a blunt person who sometimes forgets to think before speaking, blurted out \"Who sells jewelry at a restaurant? Thats so tacky!\" I privately agreed, but had the sense to keep it to myself. \n\nThe young lady at the register (which also doubled as reception area) looked very offended. She proceeded to tell us that the designer was her relative (her uncle if remember correctly) who was a veteran and because of Covid had fallen on hard times. My niece did apologize. Me and bestie made small talk with the woman as bestie is a retired disabled vet,and im also a veteran and married to retired vet. Long story short, we end up buying 3 of the pieces, totaling $70. Tbh, it wasn't because we actually wanted them. They were pretty, but I could've gotten something similar for cheaper online. We bought them,  because a) the young lady had been offended  by niece's out burst b) we wanted to support a fellow vet,  and c) we were too tired to go looking for another restaurant that evening and we didn't want to risk something being done to our food. Especially since the restaurant was a family owned one. \n\nIdk what bestie did with her pieces, but i ended up gifting the butterfly-esque pendant I bought to a  classmate of my son on a necklace chain (bought separately from a local store). My son has autism and the girl is similar.  They've been classmates for years. I did have to explain the story of the pendant to her parents though. I didn't want them to misunderstand why my son was giving their daughter \"jewelry\". (I do have a daughter but she's older and has never liked wearing jewelry. And the pendant was more youthful, like fairy or princessy type feel.)", "*She says I\u2019m a heartless AH who is not willing to help out another local business owner*\n\n**She's manipulating you** here, **insulting you**, and basically **showing you that you cannot rely on her to tell the truth**.  You aren't heartless, you have boundaries.  You are NTA, and are willing to help out, but your help is limited by your reasonable boundaries to protect your business. \n\n *and advance her dream.* \n\nThat's her job, not yours.  **You are not supposed to do her work for her.**  \n\nShe can look around and talk to business owners that sell things that are going to draw in a crowd for similar products.  She can go to craft fairs, look into online sales, and see if local \"gift\" shop owners might set up a cute little display with her products, for a percentage.  \n\n**It's not your job to use your business to promote hers.  That's like she wants to ride on your coattails, not make her own success, if she wants to use your space, your publicity, your sales people, your building,** etc.  She's trying to use you, and is probably not looking to pay rent for the privilege.  Very manipulative.\n\n*My husband thinks she is delusional.* \n\nYep.  She wants it, and thinks that is reason enough to try to force your compliance.  **Sounds like someone to protect yourself from, not someone to invite into your business space.**  I think your offer of a poster is reasonable and as far as you can safely go with this.  And she turned it down.  That's really interesting, because it makes me think she was thinking more of setting up a kiosk and having you pay for the overhead and staffing, not her.  As her taking up space in your building would also mean less seating for your own customers, it would have an effect on your success.  That's not how good business works, to stab your own foot.\n\n*My parents are on my back asking me to break my rule just once so my sister can reach more potential customers.*\n\n**They are wrong.**  Chances are you would lose customers, not her gain them, if you suddenly are selling something unrelated to your own products.  \n\n**They are wrong to insist that you subsidize her business by letting her invade yours.**  Have they looked into the overhead costs, the staffing, the rent that she would need to pay to have her stuff at your business?  Have they considered that for her to make any profit, she would need to sell X number of items per day, just to cover your costs for having her invade your space and use your building and staff?  \n\n**They are wrong to interfere in your business.**  You have good plans and instincts, and your customers appreciate your place like it is.  You are reasonable to not mess with what is working for you. \n\n**Sounds like your parents are easily swayed by what your sister wants.**  \n\nIt's okay to tell them, next time any of them bring this up, **that you \"aren't discussing this again.\"**  **You have made your decision about this, made an offer, that offer was refused, and therefore there is nothing else to discuss.**  You don't have to say this all, just say that you aren't discussing it again.  And if they won't respect this, hang up, end the conversation, or walk out.\n\n**Your sister's success is her own to achieve.  You can't give this to her.**  She needs to work for it.  If it's not working for her, she has other options and that's on her, too.", "NTA and good on you for standing firm and running your business with integrity.\n\nI think a lot of people in your position would do it, thinking it\u2019s not a big deal to put a little jewelry display by the register. And they\u2019re not entirely wrong, but the problem isn\u2019t with that part.\n\nThe problem is with all the other complications that arise from doing this, such as her expecting you to try to convince your customers to buy her jewelry, her blaming you if they don\u2019t sell well, you having to field requests from other hopeful entrepreneurs (and annoying MLMs), etc.\n\nOne suggestion that might ease some of the tension without compromising your principles: It seems like your sister is going about this whole thing the wrong way, and she could probably use some guidance and advice on how to have a better chance of making her business successful.\n\nFor example, you were doing your baking on the side while working and then only quit your job once things really picked up. She quit her job before it was realistic and put all her eggs in this crafting basket, which was a really bad idea (and probably a big factor contributing to her stress right now).\n\nIf you\u2019re open to helping her, but just not in the way she\u2019s asking, making suggestions for other ways you can help might make her feel a bit more supported, ease her stress so that she\u2019ll lay off of you, and keep your relationship in a good place.", "NTA. Not a good idea to mix business and family. Tell her to sell online, make up business cards with the crystals as a background picture and the website and have businesses carry her cards. And she can sell at craft shows. Crystals rarely have their own store, I see them more in book stores and craft  shows. You worked years on your dream, she just started. Explain that, and tell everyone the discussion is done. No more. It can't be the only thing your hit with when you visit, or visiting might have to stop.", "In fact, places where I see this happening kind of 'turn me off'. I want to see things I came for, not some jewellery.", "I also hate going into these businesses that are meant to specialize in one thing and get there bombarded by unrelated items. It\u2019s a bakery and cafe and should stay as such. It\u2019s not a general dealer", "If she wants to sell her jewelry inside your location she should pony up half the rent/insurance/overhead.", "That\u2019s a very reasonable boundary. NTA", "I would imagine there may be a legal liability if you do.  If your sister's jewelry causes an allergic reaction, are you liable because they bought it in your store?", "You want her to feel proud of what she\u2019s built on her own and not ever wonder if it was due to your involvement.", "Then you are not the problem im the situation she is."]}
