When it came time to telling my family, they congratulated us but after that they weren\u2019t very excited or even that interested. While I understand that no one is going to care about our wedding like we do, it still hurt that they just weren\u2019t excited at least initially. \n\nMy sister (25f) did ask to see my ring as she used to work in a jewellery store. When she saw that I have an emerald and diamond ring she got very snippy and said that as emeralds are her birth stone, I shouldn\u2019t have an emerald ring at all. I brushed this off because I just wanted to stay excited and happy but she kept on bringing it up and saying things like \u2018it\u2019s not even that nice of a ring\u2019. \n\nAs soon as she said that I saw red. My fianc\u00e9 got me the ring of my dreams and I know how hard he worked to save for it and find it for me. Her saying that \u2018it\u2019s not even that nice\u2019 made me so angry that I snapped back that at least I have a ring and I\u2019m not bitter and jealous because someone else got engaged and she\u2019s single. I also said that it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to just pretend to be happy for me for once. \n\nMy parents then stepped in and said that I was over the line and made it personal when it didn\u2019t need to be. \n\nAt this point we just left to go tell me grandma about the engagement and she was super excited for us! \n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to my parents or sister since and they haven\u2019t reached out either. I think I might have been TA by commenting on her relationship status, but my fianc\u00e9 says that she was repeatedly out of line and I just shut it down.

Did she make customers tell her their DOB before she'd sell them a stone?\n\nNTA, she's absurd and out of line. You totally nailed the reason why: at least you have a ring", "NTA - congratulations on your recent engagement!  Your ring sounds lovely, mine has an aquamarine.  You know how many times people have tried to gatekeep the March birthstone?  NEVER.  Your sister sounds awful, and I'm sorry that happened to you.  You tried to brush off her comments several times and she kept going there, so I wouldn't said something similar as well.\n\nJust focus on the people that are happy for you.

Here's to your family of choice!", "You'r sister sounds kinda jealous", "First: Congratulations, OP!  \n\n\nNTA. Your sisiter was bitter and jealous and trying to belittle your ring and engagement. The jabs would have kept coming, most likely well beyond just that one night.  You put her jealousy out in the open. Unfortunately, your parents chose to protect her from you in the process.  Go LC with them for a spell, and I'm sure they will reach out to make amends lest they be left out of your wedding. lol", "NTA I think your sister is jealous. I think she is jealous that you will beat her down the isle.  I figure that\u2019s why your parents are not happy either. They believe as the oldest she should get married first.

Denigrating your ring is really a problem.  I guess it isn't personal when your sister says it isn't a nice ring, but when you react, you are being personal.  Logic escapes people sometimes.

Also, you didn\u2019t make it personal, your sister did. She was just being passive aggressive and underhanded and you called it out. Keep wearing that rock solid spine of yours. This matter will only get worse as you plan the wedding. Good luck.", "NTA", "ESH. She was rude about your ring, you were rude about her relationship status.

You could have yelled at her and told her how mean and hurtful and hateful she was being. \nBut you joined the AH party when you picked something to be equally mean and hurtful about.

As for your parents, do they have a history of behaviour like this? Not caring/being excited about your accomplishments etc? Or is this the first time? And if it is, do you think they may got influenced by your sister, and this is something that could be resolved?\n\nI would try to talk about this to your parents, as I could imagine you would want your parents to be engaged in your wedding. But if they don't see their faults, make sure to prioritize your wellbeing over your parents/sisters snickering, it's still your and your fiances wedding, and it's not worth it for your day to be negatively influenced by them. Concentrate on the people who are happy for you.\n\nBest of luck to you and your fiance", "NTA.\n\nI encourage you to take this opportunity to examine your relationship with your family. I have a strong suspicion that you're about to finally figure out that your parents suck and your sister is the golden child...", "NTA, your sister isn\u2019t the only person to have ever been born in May. She doesn\u2019t own the month nor it\u2019s birthstone. Sounds like she\u2019s just jealous. On a happier note, congrats on the upcoming nuptials!", "NTA! God your sister is awful, so are your parents\u2026.. you were absolutely right to stand up for yourself and put her in her place. \n\nGet your grandma to walk you down the isle\u2026  it\u2019s clear your parents are bias towards your sister", "nta - she was totally out of line and needed to be shut down.", "NTA News flash for your sister: I own emerald jewelry and it\u2019s not my birth stone either! She is obviously jealous and owes you an apology for raining on your parade with her nasty comments. While you were also rude, I\u2019d say she deserved it.\n\nETA: wishing you every joy with your engagement and wedding!", "NTA and grats on your engagement.  Sounds like maybe your sister is the golden child.  Your sister made it personal.  Just tell your family if they think you made it personal then you will show them personal.  Just say unless YOU get an apology from them and sister NONE are invited to the wedding.  Tell your sister your fiance did NOT buy the ring with her tastes in mine as he is NOT marrying her.  He bought the ring with your tastes in mind.", "Nta- your family should be happy for you. When I told my family about my engagement I told them all to keep all negative comments to themselves or be removed my wedding invite list. I shut it down before it even started", "NTA and congratulations on your engagement! I would make sure your ring is insured and get it checked by your jeweler every year since emeralds are softer than diamonds and can take damage easily.  (Not all jewelry insurance covers repairs as well as replacements but I\u2019d look into finding a policy that covers both). I\u2019d also consider if you want even people at your wedding who are jealous and unsupportive.", "NTA.

It's going to be an eventful wedding lol.", "YTA for not speaking to your parents. They are just trying to keep the peace.", "NTA. Your ring sounds pretty and it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to make sure it is something that you would love. Your sister and parents, however; whoooooo boy. I'm stocking up on popcorn to read how eventful your wedding will be. I would say go LC with them for a bit and enjoy your engagement.", "NTA \nFirst off... Congrats! \nAnd since they don't care. Don't invite them to the wedding.", "Nta don\u2019t bother inviting them to the wedding at all if they arnt excited", "NTA. Congratulations on your engagement", "I have an emerald and diamond wedding ring and I love it.  NTA.

That\u2019s exactly what your sisters issue is. I used to have a friend like that. She got even worse when she finally met someone.

By that logic, does she just avoid being friends with people born in April? Lol", "Your ring sounds lovely, but your sister does not.
