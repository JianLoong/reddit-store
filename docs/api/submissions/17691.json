When it came time to telling my family, they congratulated us but after that they weren\u2019t very excited or even that interested. While I understand that no one is going to care about our wedding like we do, it still hurt that they just weren\u2019t excited at least initially. \n\nMy sister (25f) did ask to see my ring as she used to work in a jewellery store. When she saw that I have an emerald and diamond ring she got very snippy and said that as emeralds are her birth stone, I shouldn\u2019t have an emerald ring at all. I brushed this off because I just wanted to stay excited and happy but she kept on bringing it up and saying things like \u2018it\u2019s not even that nice of a ring\u2019. \n\nAs soon as she said that I saw red. My fianc\u00e9 got me the ring of my dreams and I know how hard he worked to save for it and find it for me. Her saying that \u2018it\u2019s not even that nice\u2019 made me so angry that I snapped back that at least I have a ring and I\u2019m not bitter and jealous because someone else got engaged and she\u2019s single. I also said that it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to just pretend to be happy for me for once. \n\nMy parents then stepped in and said that I was over the line and made it personal when it didn\u2019t need to be. \n\nAt this point we just left to go tell me grandma about the engagement and she was super excited for us! \n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to my parents or sister since and they haven\u2019t reached out either. I think I might have been TA by commenting on her relationship status, but my fianc\u00e9 says that she was repeatedly out of line and I just shut it down.

As for your parents, do they have a history of behaviour like this? Not caring/being excited about your accomplishments etc? Or is this the first time? And if it is, do you think they may got influenced by your sister, and this is something that could be resolved?\n\nI would try to talk about this to your parents, as I could imagine you would want your parents to be engaged in your wedding. But if they don't see their faults, make sure to prioritize your wellbeing over your parents/sisters snickering, it's still your and your fiances wedding, and it's not worth it for your day to be negatively influenced by them.

Sounds like maybe your sister is the golden child.  Your sister made it personal.  Just tell your family if they think you made it personal then you will show them personal.
