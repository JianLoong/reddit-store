{"id": 30997, "submission_id": "17vk0w1", "title": "AITA for feeling let down when something \"meant for me\" got taken over by my partner?", "selftext": "I (38m) have been struggling lately with mild depression. Stress at work, a cranky toddler, and some drama among my friend group have worn me a little thin the last few months, all the while I've been on a weight loss journey (down 85lbs!) so feeling some additional stress from reduced calories and moderating some of what we're my go-to favorite foods.\n\nThis past weekend, while talking with my wife (37f) I shared my stress and she asked what would help. I told her \"honestly just having pizza one night this week would cheer me up\". I said it half heartedly, but we both agreed it would be a great little pick me up, so we planned it out.\n\nI was told I got to pick where we got the pizza from and what kind of pizza to get (I was pumped). \n\nAnyway I picked the place and she agreed. We were gonna run a quick grocery trip then hit the pizza place (on the same street as the grocery store) right after. \n\nAs we're leaving the grocery store, she said she needed to go home to prepare a dish for her staff Thanksgiving the next day and that going to the place I selected would keep us out longer than she wanted. I agreed to just head home and order from a more local shop that delivers to our home.\n\nWe got home and I was browsing the menu and each time I pick something, I was told why we shouldn't get it. One pizza had mushrooms on it (I love, she hates them), so I pivoted. The next one was a Buffalo chicken pizza, but she will only do a pizza with red sauce. We went down the list and I started to feel kinda defeated. \n\nUPDATE: I've gotten a lot of feedback on going 1/2 and 1/2 in the pie. The issue there is she won't eat a pizza unless it's red sauce, so we couldn't split 1/2 red sauce, 1/2 a different type of sauce. She also wasn't a fan of topings she didn't like being only on half the pizza cause she didn't want to have to pick off any that may be on a slice she picks. Picky, but 11 years into this thing, I've come to work around it 99% of the time\n\nI wasn't mad at her, I was kinda bummed that this thing that she suggested we do to cheer me up turned from me picking the place and the pizza, to her   changing the restaurant and choosing what we got.\n\nIn the interest of peace,  told her she could order what she wanted and I would just eat left overs from the fridge. She ordered her pizza and I ate the left overs.\n\nAnyway we talked later in the evening and I shared my disappointment. I shared I was let down that my plans got dismissed, but that I wasn't mad at her, just hurt that this \"thing for me\" became a \"thing for her\". This is a conversation we've had a few times about a few different occurrences of this happening. \n\nAfter I shared how I felt, she told me I should have told her that I didn't want to go home and that I didn't want the pizza she wanted (which I kinda feel I did when I picked the place and picked the pizza, both of which got vetoed)\n\nAnyway, long story short, AITA for feeling that my wife hijacked what was supposed to be something for me, or should I have pushed back more?", "created_utc": 1700017378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vk0w1/aita_for_feeling_let_down_when_something_meant/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She acted selfishly and ignored your feelings and what you wanted to get out of this thing SHE decided with you to do together FOR YOU. I would be upset too.\n\nSounds like she's insensitive and was just focused on her own plans. She should never have agreed to go out for a meal if she knew she was going to be cooking something to bring into a work/social event the next day. That's bad planning on her part.\n\nThe fact she said 'no' to all your pizza suggestions and then accepted your offer to just eat leftovers and for her to get her way ordering whatever she wants suggests she's totally blind or dismissive of you. If I had been her I would then probably have realised \"Oh, wait this pizza meal is supposed to be for him and I already shat on the plans to eat out and now he's so annoyed with my unwillingness to pick a pizza we both want that he is now offering to eat leftovers so I can have what I want?! Sh\\*t, I better compromise or maybe I should offer to eat the leftovers so he can order whatever he wants since I am so picky in my food choice.\"\n\nWow she sucks. She isn't thinking about anyone but herself and isn't taking any kind of hints. You clearly need to be much more explicit to her about what you want and what you expect. I would also stop compromising so much so that you end up with leftovers and she gets to eat a take away meal that should have been for you...\n\nDoes this happen a lot in your relationship, where she acts as if you don't exist or your needs/wants don't matter or are just an afterthought to her getting her way?", "NTA - my heart sank for you when I read this part: \u201cshe ordered her pizza and I ate the leftovers\u201d. You two planned out the pizza dinner to cheer you up. Simple request, easy to accommodate. Then she suddenly and last minute realizes that she doesn\u2019t have time to do that with you because she needs to make Thanksgiving food for her coworkers. Poor planning and difficult to believe it was a simple accident. Then she vetoed every suggestion for pizza toppings you offered until she got exactly what she wanted. I would be upset too. \n\nNTA", "Could some of your depression and stress be from your partner not listening to you? Seems like it\u2019s a pattern with them, maybe be firmer with what you need? Take it easy on yourself as well. And congrats on the weight loss!!! Major accomplishment", "NTA \nSorry if I missed it but was there a reason you couldn't order two pizzas?  One that you wanted and one that she wanted?  Left over pizza for lunch is the one...", "NTA your wife was being inconsiderate and you communicated that to her. Congrats on the weight loss, you should get the Buffalo chicken, that sounds so good", "NTA- What really broke my heart was that she got the pizza she wanted and you just ate the leftovers. You've made an improvement to yourself with your weight loss, but still suffering from the mental and tedious struggles of life, and just wanted this one pick-me-up to help give you some form of happiness. Then she had to make it all about herself and her staff Thanksgiving. Nothing was for you or about you. \n\nIt sounds like a regular thing to where you've learned to expect it with her and that's really sad.\n\nCongrats on your weight loss, bro!!! Don't let anything get you down when it comes to that, at least.", "NTA and I get that money might have been an issue but why didn't you get 2:pizza? You clearly are not compatible for sharing so gt your own and have leftovers for lunch \nStand up for yourself and get your pizza tomorrow, she can fend for herself one night", "NTA. But you need to learn to go on an ego trip for small wishes like a pizza. Go out for a pizza on your own one day and put your phone on silence when you do it. Eat whatever you like and be happy about it. Then go home. Or order home a pizza for you. If she dictates what kind of pizza it should be and from where, tell her \"fine, order one for yourself, this is for me\".", "Your NTA but your partner is definitely a asshole\nYou stated that this is a normal occurrence and that is not a good relationship at all. Please get some counseling for both you and your partner you should not have a baby in this situation between you two it's a bad environment for them to grow up in", "NTA. You have a right to your feelings and she was rude by making this moment about herself. If she can't even show support over a pizza, what else will she show support for? If I were you, I'd get myself into therapy and reevaluate if this relationship is right for me. Nobody's got time for an unsupportive partner.", "NTA but maybe next time, instead of one large pizza, get two small ones.", "NTA for feeling let down but you need to stick up for yourself and communicate exactly what you want. She said she needed to make something for a thanksgiving thing at work so you basically let her put work above your needs. That's on you. Communication is key to success.", "NTA.\n\nShe has a history of doing this. You've communicated that MULTIPLE times, yet she still continues. Now she's blaming you for not speaking up?\n\nKinda seems like she doesn't respect you or is just extremely selfish.", "NTA. I could never order a meal and have my partner eat leftovers. WTF mindset is that. I\u2019m sorry but your wife is selfish, might need to talk about it.", "OP next just order two small or personal sized pizzas if compromising doesnt work. Or tell her that you're ordering x pizza and does she want a different one for herself? Whatever you do I would work to break this habit of giving in to her to the point where you're giving nothing to yourself", "NTA After 11 years together the occasional hijack is going to happen. What's not ok is your wife turning this back on you as if you did something wrong.", "Nta, could have ordered two small ones, so both had what they wanted", "NTA - Doing something for someone else means you subsume your own ego and be there for them. Your wife never let go of what she wanted and what would make her life easier. It went from her doing something for you to both of you doing things for her. Her response when you brought this up was to gaslight you and say it\u2019s your fault she didn\u2019t do anything FOR YOU.\n\nShe may have intended to do something for you but her own ego just did what it always does and took everything over, ruining your night.\n\nYou either need couple counseling to improve communication effectiveness and following through on that communication \u2026\n\n\u2026 or give up on her and start doing things for yourself without her. Go workout after work. Go see a movie by yourself. Go get a pizza and enjoy it with a friend. Rely on yourself for these moments of intimacy and calm because you can\u2019t trust her to give them to you if she won\u2019t change.", "INFO: why wasn't a compromise happening? For the first pizza, half could be mushroom half could be something else she'd eat.\n\nHonestly, this sound tiring. Is your wife also having stress that is causing her to be inconsiderate? Because the food thing seems to be a result of poor planning on her end.", "NTA. Your wife is inconsiderate and definitely did make this special thing for you all about her. Also\u2026If you were the wife in this situation, there wouldn\u2019t be so many \u201cE S H\u201d answers lol. Just saying.", "NTA. For the record I don't think she is a monster in any way, and it's good that you expressed yourself, but she does need some practice in active listening. I think your feelings are valid and you expressed them in a very mature way.", "NTA, but if you know your wife needs clear communication then that's what you need to do. It sounds like you had a very \"oh no it's ok, I dont mind\" attitude during the interaction", "NTA - She asked what would help, you gave an answer. She agreed to it. Then I guess she immediately forgot what she agreed to...? And somehow that is your fault. I am not following her logic. You sound very rational and she sounds inconsiderate. \n\nThis made me salty and I wish I could order you several mushroom pizzas.", "NTA. It's exactly as you described. She took a thing for you and turned it into a thing for her. I think the intention was there, but the execution was awful.", "NTA because she walked in with the knowledge that this was supposed to make you feel better and then didn\u2019t voluntarily defer to you on making the choices. But yeah, you should have said what you wanted. There are some people who just ask for what they want. And people like you and me sit silently feeling bad that we didn\u2019t get what we wanted instead or in addition to that. But reality is, most of those people? They assume we are going to say \u201cno I really want this pizza. I\u2019ll order quickly but I am still going\u201d or \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want red sauce. If you want to order your own pizza go ahead, but I\u2019m eating this.\u201d So they don\u2019t even register that they might be blocking us from having something. I\u2019ve spent a long time with a sibling who always asks and states her preferences while I have always felt that people should acknowledge the birthday person or the guest visiting from out of town or the person who is feeling queasy and whatnot. So basically I spent a lifetime quietly getting more and more frustrated and resentful. I\u2019m trying harder not to just be passive. I think you should too.", "NTA.\n\nShe definitely ruined it for you and made it about her", "NTA.  Man, you gotta stand up for yourself.  It\u2019s not necessary to make it into a whole thing or anything, either.   But what you definitely shouldn\u2019t do is just fold and go with someone else\u2019s flow.   \n\nIf you\u2019re not great at being super direct or you don\u2019t like shutting other people down, how about:   You want x?  That\u2019s fair\u2014then let\u2019s get 2 personal pizzas because I\u2019m splurging with my dream pizza come hell or high water!\n\nYou also may need to make your wife aware that she\u2019s \u201coverriding\u201d your preferences instead of working with you.  She may not be aware that she\u2019s steamrolling.  And she won\u2019t be aware if you just fold.", "NTA, but you need to speak up for yourself more in the moment. And if you can't do 1/2 and 1/2,  just order two small pizzas. It shouldn't be that complicated.", "Are you sure some of your depression isn\u2019t from a partner who doesn\u2019t consider you ?  Don\u2019t overlook that possibility.  She totally took over, then still put it on you. Some narcissistic tendencies.", "NTA, but your wife is. I'm really sorry, op. This could have been an easy to fix situation if your partner was more considerate of your feelings. She owes you an apology.", "NTA, but it seems like you married a woman who is oblivious to the feelings of those around her and that\u2019s a really big problem. \n\nI had a roommate like that. The other roommates and I kept getting upset with her because in our minds, a reasonable person would consider other people\u2019s feelings and she just didn\u2019t. When we confronted her after months of her behavior, she was appalled that we were offended and thought she was acting maliciously. She just expected us to confront her and tell her to stop. We expected her to not act like that. Our expectations of each other were completely different. \n\nYour wife is my roommate in this scenario. It\u2019s up to you to say, \u201cthis is my treat. It\u2019s may not be convenient for you or what you\u2019d choose. You don\u2019t get to veto it. If you don\u2019t like the pizza or the place or whatever else, it\u2019s on you to order something separately for yourself, but this is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Some people need confrontation and for you to spell it out. Stop trying to be accommodating and avoid confrontation. Take control. Otherwise, you\u2019ll never be happy.", "NTA. Your wife is beyond rude and a total arsehole. You can\u2019t tell me she\u2019s that packing in self awareness she had no idea what she was doing. And absolute arsehole act on her behalf and she should be embarrassed. She KNEW this was supposed to be for you. Obviously little mis has to have the limelight couldn\u2019t handle that. Far out pizza is not a huge ask.", "NTA. She disregarded your feelings and needs, then tried to blame it on you.\n\nOn the other hand if you always fold like wet paper without explanation it gets progressively harder for her to understand, especially if her listening skills are already not too notch.\n\nI think a bit of copule's counselling to improve communication could be useful to improve communication.", "Nta she's self centered she reminds me of my mother who make her favorite dishes for someone else's birthday", "Have you guys never heard of The Joey Special?", "I\u2019m literally the pickiest eater I know, like I won\u2019t eat stuff that had a pickle too close cause I can still smell it and I\u2019ll gag. Anyways, that being said, I still go 1/2 and 1/2 on pizza but have it cut in squares cause then you can avoid the pieces with overlap. Compromise my good people.", "NTA. Your wife is selfish.", "Nta", "NTA, especially since this sounds like a pattern. You might have to be a bit firmer when you really want something. Don\u2019t spend years getting a fraction of what you want because it\u2019s easier.", "Are you seriously asking if YOU are the asshole here?  Your wife is UNBELIEVABLY selfish and quite frankly I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve put up with her for 11 years.  You SHOULD be mad at her, it is so very clear that she cares only for herself.  Not only could you not go to the place you wanted (because that extra 10 minutes would be the end of the world), which you went along with without complaint, you also couldn\u2019t have the flavour you wanted, because it\u2019s not *her* 1st choice, and you couldn\u2019t even go 1/2\u2019s, because she is SO SELFISH she couldn\u2019t live with picking a couple of things she didn\u2019t like off her pieces IF they even ended up there in the 1st place.  Sounds awful when I say it like that, yeah?  That\u2019s because IT IS AWFUL.\nHonestly, I don\u2019t love how this sub is always like \u2018omg, divorce immediately!\u2019, but if I were you I would be *seriously* evaluating if this extreme selfishness is the norm for her and you\u2019ve just been putting up with it, and searching for your self esteem.", "And you can't order 2 small pizzas?

That really sucks.", "NTA, but dude, you\u2019re a middle aged man. Eat what you want. But also, some advice: Don\u2019t sabotage your weight loss by eating your feelings. If you have to splurge on a snack every now and then, go somewhere you can get a single big slice of pizza instead of the whole pie. Piecemealing cheats like this \u2014 if you\u2019ve got to cheat at all \u2014 is way better than pigging out. And it\u2019s much easier to control. Have a slice of pizza or a good burger (skip the fries) every couple of weeks and call it good. Your wife probably doesn\u2019t realize how jazzed you were for a piece of pizza because she\u2019s not on the same journey as you are.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is manipulative, selfish and probably a tad narcissistic. She's walking all over you and you are letting her to \"keep the peace\".  Fuck that! Couples are allowed to argue.

Your spouse is not a mind reader. When something bothers you, you owe to to both of you to speak up. It's also very easy to choose the easy path, and that's what you're doing here.

You didn\u2019t get pizza. And she doesn\u2019t care while she sits and eats pizza by herself. You know she doesn\u2019t care because her response was already unreasonable.

What I\u2019ve learned is that wallowing and waiting for my partner to realize I\u2019m sad and step up never works.
