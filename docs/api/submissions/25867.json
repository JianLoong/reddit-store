Do not expect them to love you you or treat you as their favorite aunt.", "YTA\n\nTo Niya, you are cool aunt OP.\n\nTo your other cousins, you are aunt who doesn't care OP.\n\nYou sound like you are spoiling this kid. \n\n>to me they all seem like little brats\n\nMaybe because you haven't actually spent enough time to get to know them????? Also bit rich to say about kids under 8 years old.", "So you won't even take the other kids to try? They \"seem\" like brats but since you don't see them you don't know. \n\nHow do you know the kids would create fuss if you never see them? Why don't you see them more often, is that your fault or the parents cause it sounds like yours.\n\nYTA by far.", "YTA. Make an effort.", "YTA, either take the others on trips, or quit taking your niece, you are showing favoritism and that will only hurt her with her other cousins.", "INFO: why do they have to be multi-day trips? You use that as an excuse to not bring your other nieces and nephews but don\u2019t really say WHY it has to be that way?\n\nYTA. I get it that you have a special bond with one kid, and I get that the circumstances are different, but the way you explain it you basically never gave any other niece or nephew a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of getting close to you. You brush them off as brats because they didn\u2019t instantly bond with you like Niya, but YOU only made the effort to see them a few times a year. It would be one thing if you did big group day trips then every once and awhile had a small thing with Niya. But to only take her on any trip is pretty shitty aunt behavior.\n\nThis is golden child by proxy. Be it a mother, grandmother, or aunt. You have more than one \u201cchild\u201d in the situation and you are blatantly and obviously treating one a ton better than any of the others because she \u201cdeserves\u201d it.", "NAH\n\nI get it, but at the same time, you\u2019re pushing your family away by doing what you\u2019re doing.  Try putting some effort in with your other family members.  Who knows, you may enjoy their company.", "If you never make an effort with the other kids, YTA.", "Since they are not siblings, honestly NTA. Life just happened this way. And i'm pretty sure that they also wouldn't want to spend so much time with you on trip if they don't know you well. Are the kids even close to each other? Probably they won't even notice you're showing favourism if their parents are not filling their heads with this. (and you and Niya aren't rubbing it in their face ofc)", "YTA. You are absolutely causing harm to the kids who see you favor your niece and neglect them.", "YTA - In doing this you\u2019re creating a rift between Nita and her cousins because they\u2019ll obviously grow resentful of the blatant favouritism.", "Could you not spend more time with your other nieces / nephews to get to know them better?\n\nI have a lot of nephews / nieces and I try to treat them equally regardless. It\u2019s not their fault and they will end up getting upset.", "If you are taking one sibling and not the rest, YTA.\n\nWhen they get to be teenagers, I can see when that would be fine, but not now at their age.\n\nIf her parents had any brains, they would start to limit your contact with your favorite.", "YTA, if you have time to take her to Disney, and on other trips, maybe you could use that time to get to know your other nieces and nephews. Try putting yourself in their shoes?", "YTA. They are kids. They are all different and unique and deserve an aunt. It's okay you prefer Niya because you are tight. But not making an effort to do something with the other kids is making a choice. They don't have to get trips to Disneyland - but what about the local fair? Do you go see their school plays if you do Niyas? Would the other kids be easier to handle if you took them one on one to build a relationship? Is there an activity better suited to who they are as individuals because you are purposefully not building a relationship with them and letting Niya has the older child advantage of being there when you were available. It's time to develop better relationships with the other kids and maybe scale her trips down a bit to allow time and money for the other kids. You don't need to make it 'equal' exactly - you do have a bond with Niya. But not making an effort with the other kids is pretty sad. You don't even say you can't handle them you say you don't want to try. Given the a chance in a way that is tolerable for you. Make their parents come for behaviour only. Do group outings.", "INFO: are you interested in trying to create better relationships with the other kids? I read that your other nieces and nephews live much further, so these trips might not be viable.\n\nI also noticed Niya is 8 and you say she's the first born after you, so the other kids are much younger. Are you open to the possibility of camping or traveling with the others once they get older? I'm not sure if Y-T-A or N-A-H, but I think treating Niya differently when she has parents in her life (I assume) will impact her relationship with her cousins.", "Wait, so all of these kids are siblings? Yeah, YTA. \n\nPut yourself in those kid's shoes. \"Why doesn't my aunt love me?\", \"Why does she love my sister more?\". Even if it's not true or your intention, that's what you are making them feel.\n\nFine, you have a bond with one and not the others. But if you are going to do something big and special like taking her to Disney, it's a dick move to leave the other kids out and not even wanting to include them.", "Completely NTA-  that is the advantage to not having kids of your own, you actually get to have favorites, unlike parents(if they're good parents, anyway). Besides, it's understandable you have a bond with Niya, you've spent a lot more time with her than the other kids. Your relatives are just jealous they don't get free stuff and childcare from you. You don't owe them anything.  I would say, however, to make sure Niya and you don't rub it in the other kids' faces.", "NTA, but you won\u2019t convince the other parents.", "NTA,   it would be different if they were your kids", "NAH-Everyone involved has a right to their feelings and really no one is wrong. As one of the cousins I'd probably be annoyed but I also understand that some people just have a special bond and that's ok too. \n\nCan y'all all try a trip together (parent included)and see how the other kids do? Also what about leaving the door open for when the other kids get a little older?", "NTA.\n\nYou're only an aunt--or perhaps an \"aunt once removed\"; you're allowed to have wildly different relationships with different nieces/nephews.  It's not like you're their parent.\n\n**Your closeness to Niya has NO BAD EFFECT ON THEM (other than jealousy, which isn't your problem and which you can safely ignore.)**\n\nYou might want to try a couple of short excursions with the other ones to be kind, but you don't need to id you don't want to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like no hit, slap, bite anything. The first time she tried, her mom said I would leave if she hit me. Everyone in my family tried to make her hit me, literally telling a 10 month old to hit.

Seeing them isn't as easy. We see at most at family functions or celebrations. Two three times a year. \n\nIf I go to the city they live for any purpose, I ofcourse visit them.

Its just the way they are.\n\nI was a youth tennis coach and despite only seeing them for an hour at a time most kids managed to annoy me at some point. Some learn faster than others. Some listen more than others. Just the vast majority are brats. \n\nNiya sounds like one of the rare cases when you get a great child to raise. Doesn't mean the others don't deserve your attention.", "MAYBE? Obviously you have unrealistic expectations. Toddlers don't have much control over their actions. They all misbehave. Niya sounds very unusual. Not in a great way, honestly. Just... she's not a normal child.\n\nIf you don't care about the other kids, keep favoring Niya.
