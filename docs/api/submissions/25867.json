I love my nieces and nephews though, (more accurately they are kids of my cousins).   One niece I am especially close to is Niya (F8). I have many reasons for it. She is first child born after me. I love her parents, and looked after her since she was a newborn. I stayed with them for months when I was studying which meant we really bonded. She would literally ditch her mom for me. \n\nWhen my other nieces and nephews were born, I was working and living away from them. I saw them like 3 times a year. I don't have much bond with them. \n\nHaving this bond meant I love taking Niya on trips with me. I take her to Disney, or camping or parks etc. I know her well and can manage her. I can't say same about other kids. While I am cool with them, I don't have the same kind of patience and to me they all seem like little brats. (Niya didn't even cry with me when she was small. I was her comfort space.)\n\nNow my cousins are lowkey mad I am taking only Niya on trips. I tried to explain to them whoever I take need to stay with me for entire trip. These aren't one day trips. Any of the other kids would create a fuss. \n\nThey tell me I don't know that till I try to take them. I don't want to be caught in that position. I get a headache even imagining it. \n\nThe family is split on this and calling me AH for showing blatant favourism with kids. \n\nAITA?\n\nFrom comments: I work in one city where none of my cousins live. I only get weekends off that I need to relax. One weekend a month or so I go to my hometown to visit my parents. Niya's dad's home is right next door to mine. She will mostly be there. Or she will be at her mother's house, 15 mins away from my parents house. \n\nI have 4 other cousins with kids. 3 of them live in various other cities. Cities I don't normally visit and is out of my way. They come home to my hometown (their parental homes) for celebrations or festivals. I meet them all at that parties. \n\nIf I go to the district they are in, I will make it a point to visit them. Give kids gift, hang out and play with them. \n\nLeft over cousin lives in another country and visits 2 months every two years (at most). \n\nNiya's dad isn't with her half the time. He works in merchant Navy. When her dad is here they go on trips as a family. \n\nHer dad, my brother has done a lot for me. I take her out on vacation when her dad isn't here. Mostly long trips. Sometimes she just comes over to my city and stays with me during work week. My mom also comes with us so she can keep an eye on her when I am working. \n\nNone of my cousins want this staying with me for weeks thing. I already gift them and take them out when they are in my vicinity. What they are demanding is to take the kids on long vacations too. My best guess is it's cause they don't want to pay to take kids on these kind of trips themselves. Disney and Hogwarts for example. \n\nThat's a no. For one , oldest one among these kids is 6 years old. Youngest is a toddler. They are too little for me to handle. \n\nI am not good with kids. I never wanted or liked kids. I am childfree myself, something I decided. Niya is the only exception for reasons I cannot even verbalise. We have a special bond. The kind where she asks for me before she goes to bed and when she wakes up. At 1 year of age. Even when I didn't visit for weeks. Her love for me is what keeps me with her, I guess. \n\nAnd even though she is 8, she doesn't make me feel like I am looking after a friend. I have a lot of childish interests too. We share them. And going with her isn't me taking her out, it's my vacation too. I love sharing it with her. \n\nI don't have excess time.\n\nNiya is my father's brother's son's only child. They live right next door to my parents house. I refer to her dad as my brother unconsciously (though he is my cousin too) cause I was mostly raised by our grandmother who always told me he is my brother. Don't call them cousins. I am an only child.

Your money and your time.", "It's your time and money and you can't force relationships that aren't happening naturally. NTA", "If OP doesn't care about those ties it doesn't matter.  Seems to me that they're not overly concerned, especially as a Childfree person.  Most of us (Childfree people) make other arrangements and don't expect to rely on family as a retirement/end of life plan.  It's not really relevant here.", "No way. OP has a relationship with Niya. The other cousins live in other cities. Why on Earth do you think that OP is some sort of commodity that can be freely shared?", "Are we really saying OP should just come pick up some kids that barely know her and take them on a trip, away from home, and for a few days even at that, and just hope by a miracle they don't suddenly miss their parents or something while being how far away from them? \n\nEven if OP didn't take them to Disney, etc, as a first-time thing but to her place. OP is still how far away from the kids homes, with some of them living in other city's. Will the parents take the trip and come pick up their kids if they start crying they want to go home? \nIt's kids under 8. Not 16 year olds.\n\nOP already commented that if she's in the town they live in, she visits. Brings gifts, etc. \n\nCome on. Think about how most kids would react being sent to a town how far away, with an aunt they barely know.\nThat's not the moment you gamble with it. Then, the cousins could take a vacation with OP and their kids for them to get closer first, and the parents are present.", "Sorry for correcting you when you are supporting me. But Niya is my cousin brother's kid too. He is my brother in my heart. His mom raised me half the time and grandma raised us both together. We lived in same house for years too. But by relationship, he is my cousin.", "The others either live in different cities or different countries, so how easy do you think it would be for OP to spend more time with them?", "Dear God you're getting some shit thrown at you.\n\nHow on Earth are you supposed to take a herd of young kids and toddlers around Disney or Hogwart's on your own and at your own expense? Who, among your cousins, would take half a dozen young children into a public space with no additional help.\n\nI don't have kids either, nor do I have siblings but I have over thirty cousins. I was closer to some cousins more than others and I have a small handful of cousins who I have not met for nearly fifty years. My oldest cousin is older than my youngest aunt (or was, they're both dead now).\n\nIt is as clear as the nose on your face that you are going to be closer to some of them more than others due to age, distance and frequency of contact. Anyone saying differently is talking a load of bollocks and, from your post, you do not neglect the other kids. You simply do not see them as frequently for many, perfectly reasonable, reasons.\n\nMaybe, as a compromise, tell the parents that if they stump up the money and at least two of them come, you'll take the kids to one of these expensive theme parks. The only down side, of course, is that you will have to be with a bunch of toddlers and really young kids at one of these expensive theme parks.\n\nNTA at all OP", "It really sounds like it's the parents that are upset at lack of free vacations and childcare.  If the other aren't close with Niya (which, living in different cities sounds likely) it's unlikely to be an issue.  And in any case, there's zero obligation required by OP here, she's simply being nice to the niece she considers more of a friend and not a burden (like other kids are) due to how they bonded.  Life's not fair, but OP's time and money are hers to spend how she chooses.", "I cannot believe how ridiculous folks are being about this. Different kids in different families get different opportunities. \n\nMy older half-sister grew up in the country with my retired grandparents. She got her own room, to pursue horse riding, to walk to school and other stuff I would have loved. But I never resented her for it, nor did my other sibs.", "Even if he isn\u2019t your biological brother the same rationale applies because that\u2019s how you see him and her. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you you are doing something wrong. You have e a very different relationship with her than you do the other kids and there is nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m sure this is more the parents making a fuss than it is the kids and they need to knock that shit off", "Technology is a great thing. I have family the other side of the world", "She didn't choose to have them? Just because they're family doesn't mean they deserve trips their parents clearly can't pay for.\n\n And it sounds like OP is pretty fine with not being everyone's favorite aunt. So, what exactly is the problem here? Her family is upset because they're not getting free trips and childcare for their kids that they *checks notes* chose to have themselves? Her entitled family is the AH.\n\nNTA OP, things aren't the same between you and your other niblings because the RELATIONSHIP isn't even close to the same.", "Spend time with them how? Some live in other countries. I literally haven't seen 2 of my cousins in more than 10 years because we don't travel across the country to see one another.", "That's true,  but face timing isn't the same as proximity."]}
