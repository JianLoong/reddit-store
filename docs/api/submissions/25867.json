I love my nieces and nephews though, (more accurately they are kids of my cousins).   One niece I am especially close to is Niya (F8). I have many reasons for it. She is first child born after me. I love her parents, and looked after her since she was a newborn. I stayed with them for months when I was studying which meant we really bonded. She would literally ditch her mom for me. \n\nWhen my other nieces and nephews were born, I was working and living away from them. I saw them like 3 times a year. I don't have much bond with them. \n\nHaving this bond meant I love taking Niya on trips with me. I take her to Disney, or camping or parks etc. I know her well and can manage her. I can't say same about other kids. While I am cool with them, I don't have the same kind of patience and to me they all seem like little brats. (Niya didn't even cry with me when she was small. I was her comfort space.)\n\nNow my cousins are lowkey mad I am taking only Niya on trips. I tried to explain to them whoever I take need to stay with me for entire trip. These aren't one day trips. Any of the other kids would create a fuss. \n\nThey tell me I don't know that till I try to take them. I don't want to be caught in that position. I get a headache even imagining it. \n\nThe family is split on this and calling me AH for showing blatant favourism with kids. \n\nAITA?\n\nFrom comments: I work in one city where none of my cousins live. I only get weekends off that I need to relax. One weekend a month or so I go to my hometown to visit my parents. Niya's dad's home is right next door to mine. She will mostly be there. Or she will be at her mother's house, 15 mins away from my parents house. \n\nI have 4 other cousins with kids. 3 of them live in various other cities. Cities I don't normally visit and is out of my way. They come home to my hometown (their parental homes) for celebrations or festivals. I meet them all at that parties. \n\nIf I go to the district they are in, I will make it a point to visit them. Give kids gift, hang out and play with them. \n\nLeft over cousin lives in another country and visits 2 months every two years (at most). \n\nNiya's dad isn't with her half the time. He works in merchant Navy. When her dad is here they go on trips as a family. \n\nHer dad, my brother has done a lot for me. I take her out on vacation when her dad isn't here. Mostly long trips. Sometimes she just comes over to my city and stays with me during work week. My mom also comes with us so she can keep an eye on her when I am working. \n\nNone of my cousins want this staying with me for weeks thing. I already gift them and take them out when they are in my vicinity. What they are demanding is to take the kids on long vacations too. My best guess is it's cause they don't want to pay to take kids on these kind of trips themselves. Disney and Hogwarts for example. \n\nThat's a no. For one , oldest one among these kids is 6 years old. Youngest is a toddler. They are too little for me to handle. \n\nI am not good with kids. I never wanted or liked kids. I am childfree myself, something I decided. Niya is the only exception for reasons I cannot even verbalise. We have a special bond. The kind where she asks for me before she goes to bed and when she wakes up. At 1 year of age. Even when I didn't visit for weeks. Her love for me is what keeps me with her, I guess. \n\nAnd even though she is 8, she doesn't make me feel like I am looking after a friend. I have a lot of childish interests too. We share them. And going with her isn't me taking her out, it's my vacation too. I love sharing it with her. \n\nI don't have excess time.\n\nNiya is my father's brother's son's only child. They live right next door to my parents house. I refer to her dad as my brother unconsciously (though he is my cousin too) cause I was mostly raised by our grandmother who always told me he is my brother. Don't call them cousins. I am an only child.
