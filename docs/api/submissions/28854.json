He got snapped at and went to touch it again? \n\nNTA. He needs to keep his hands to himself.", "NTA. He clearly didn\u2019t take the hint. Side note though, if you\u2019re doing billing you should have a more private working space.", "Orchards are fragile!!!", "I honestly think the issue here is your desk location and setup. In fact, it's concerning that you're doing billing at a location that's essentially a lobby, even if unused.\n\nI think rep was confused by the set up; maybe he thought you're sitting at what appears to be an admissions desk. But slight AH to him for attempting to touch the pot a second time after you told him it was yours. \n\nAs for you - I don't blame you. We all have our preferences. I happen to work in a suite with others so I kinda don't care if they occasionally borrow a pen or such (all the good pens are locked up).\n\nI think it's time to speak to your boss about a better and more private space. And due to the billing you do - likely a necessary step for liability reasons.", "Nta. It's like seeing someone about to touch something hot.  He could have damaged it", "NTA. \n\n>the the rep was a good guy overall\n\nIf this is true, then he can surely keep his hands to himself.", "NTA.  He should've mastered \"don't touch other people's stuff\" before age 10.

Truly everyone involved sucks a bit lol", "Personally I think YTA. I've seen lots of people touch flowers in office settings, and you snapped at him immediately. I think people on Reddit would give a lot more YTA answers if they pictured these exchanges going on in real life and how jarring and rude it would be.\n\nWhen he went to touch the pot, not the flower, at the end he was probably trying to turn it back around to how it was in the beginning before he disturbed it. I just think it was a really intense and not socially appropriate way to handle such a minor incident but that's just me.", "ESH. You could've been a whole lot nicer and not immediately just popped off. He had no right to touch your things especially the second time. If he likes orchids then I think he knows they're fragile.", "NTA.  Is the guy two?  Adults should.know how to look with their eyes, not with their hands.  Plus, it shouldn't matter if it's your personal property or the doctors', it's *not his* and so he shouldn't have touched it in the first place.", "ESH. He definitely should have stopped when you said something, but if your plant was on a counter/surface where it was accessible, then you have to expect people to touch it- people touch plants.

Or the internet?", "So maybe a bit harsh on delivery... but I understand the reasoning. I personally dont grow orchids because theyre too frustrating and slow for me. I have hibiscus and caladiums and herbs. Its odd though that he reached for it again after mentioning it... BUT also sometimes peoples with mental delays or disabilities just truly DO have processing problems. You could have maybe kindly said yes i like them too so im sure you know how fragile they are if touched? Also.... you need a real office. This is a hugely unprofessional set up. Maybe keep the orchid elsewhere untill a better location? Maybe get a fake one for the office instead if people are in and out right now? Try to maybe just be a but softer and kinder.... you can be direct without being so blunt or harsh..... sometimes it CAN make you come off as miserable and i know youre really not intending to do so. Not attacking you just trying to speak from experience. I personally avoid curt epople because they DO come off as harsh and a bit unwelcoming at times even if they dont intend to do so.", "[deleted]", "If it was your purse, or papers, or something of that nature, I'd agree with you but getting snippy over someone admiring a potted plant seems extreme.
