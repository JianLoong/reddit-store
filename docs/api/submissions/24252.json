I have 4 and 5 year olds, this is normal behaviour for the age, but it really messes with your sleep. As their parent it\u2019s mine my husbands job to look after this. It\u2019s not your job as their older sister to take on the responsibility of the nighttime needs of your siblings. It may take some time, but every time they come to your room, take them to your parents room and walk away. If your parents have any issue, you can tell them it\u2019s not your responsibility to care for them in the night, it\u2019s theirs. You can also recommend they look up what instrumental parentification is, because what they\u2019re doing here falls under that category.

Like- I get to do a lot of different stuff that others can\u2019t because of how much I do for my parents.", "I\u2019m already planing in going to a collage that requires freshmen to live in campus. So that\u2019s definitely solved. I\u2019m just trying to get good grades so that I can get some scholarships so that I don\u2019t have to pay for college on my own. And I can\u2019t do that with children in my bed.", "He has ODD. He can- and will- say anything he wants to get his way. Kids with ODD are known to say things just to manipulate adults and other kids to get their way.  And he already has a strong relationship with my parents. My room is just closer and more convenient.", "They say it\u2019s a \u201cfire hazard\u201d", "Homeschooling isn\u2019t abusive. I enjoy it more the public school. I also have school related issues that public school won\u2019t accommodate for unless I have an autism diagnosis. (Which I\u2019m in the process of getting but it could take a year.)", "Instrumental parentification is emotional abuse and OP\u2019s parents are definitely doing that to them here.", "I\u2019m hoping she has plans for post secondary education that is too far to live at home. Or move out, if possible.\n\nThey can\u2019t keep her there forever. Once she is an adult, she can leave.", "Can you give an example? Because I don't see that, everything you post just sounds more and more abusive. I'm sorry you're going through all that", "Definitely. Sounds good! How do your parents feel about that happening in less than a year, changing the kids\u2019 sleeping arrangements?", "They definitely care. They actively encourage me to go hang out with my friends, and invite them over to my house for parties, and I\u2019m out of the house at least twice a week more close to three times, and itll  be more soon with the school year starting.", "It\u2019ll actually be in 2 years. I got held back 2 years ago because I didn\u2019t maintain good grades. My mom said it was for the best because she didnt think I would be \u201cmature enough to survive collage\u201d by going when I was supposed to.", "And they have no plan. Just gonna see what happens I guess.", "That sounds like things normal kids get to do? That's pretty much the bare minimum you need to socialize and learn social skills", "I would still start your own planning, then. We recently had a post on this sub about a teen girl who was in a somewhat similar situation to yours \u2014 the caretaker of an infant relative while being homeschooled and her parents poo-pooing college.  \n\n\u201cGet out, this is not normal\u201d was our consensus advice.  You may not be at that point yet.  But planning now makes things easier."]}
