Kathy legally cannot prevent your daughter from contacting you. I'm an autistic mom of two autistic kids. What I recommend is having the psychologist who diagnosed Maddy write up a detailed list of her needs, including social ones. And I would deal with Kathy only through an attorney. You need to have a parenting plan in place that includes Maddy's sensory needs. When I got divorced, I had my attorney file an order for a parenting coordinator--another psychologist who could intervene if my kids' dad wanted to push them to do something they couldn't.

Maddy is now old enough to express her own wants, and right now, she does not want to see Kathy.  This was due to KATHY'S actions, not yours.  It is appropriate that you give Maddy some space and time.  When MADDY is ready, you might want to offer for Kathy to visit while you are present, so that Maddy feel safe and comfortable.  \n\nKathy's damaged and further crumbling relationship with Maddy is a result of her own choices and behaviors.  It is now on *her* to fix it, and to do so with the consideration that a child with several disorders including anxiety deserves.  Simply yelling at Maddy and then yelling at you does not indicate that she wants to improve her relationship with Maddy.  It just indicates that she wants Maddy to be a good doll, who plays the perfect daughter whenever Kathy deigns to drop in.\n\nYour job in this is to respect and care for your daughter.

Wow wow wow, the people that voted Y T A couldn't have read the same post that I did. Seriously I would like them all to reverse the genders of the parents in this situation, if OP was the bio mom instead of the dad all of them would have been praising her for protecting her child. They would be calling a man in bio mom's position a sperm donor not the \"real father\". That's just laughable, giving birth does not make you the \"real mother\"\n\nBio mom really really messed up by not taking Maddy home when she wanted to go and then made it so much worse by taking the phone away, that was just wrong. I do think you should try supervised visits if/when Maddy is ready but that needs to be up to her, not you, not bio mom.\n\n Bio mom needs to realize and understand that she broke Maddy's trust and confidence in her on their last outing and that she is going to have to rebuild that if she is truly interested in having a meaningful relationship with Maddy. \n\nThe fact that she signed her rights away will absolutely help you if she tries to take you to court but with 9 other children I can't imagine she would have time to even try that. \n\nI think you should stop saying that you are not allowing her to see Maddy because that's not really what's happening. Maddy doesn't want to spend time with her so start expressing it that way instead. You aren't keeping her from bio mom, you are simply respecting Maddy's wishes and allowing her to make that decision. When/if she is ready and actually wants to have time with bio mom you should allow it, you would only be TA if Maddy wanted that time with bio mom and you weren't allowing it. \n\nWhen/If she wants to start seeing her again I would definitely start with supervised visits first. If that works maybe bio mom can take her out under the condition that Maddy's phone is never taken from her again.

She went to spend time with her daughter and she's asking for another woman, calling her \"mommy\". All because you didn't talk to her about this entire situation over the years. How do you not do that?\n\nMaddy needs her mother in her life. It's not right to deny her access to her child. I really think the adults need to sit down and have a real discussion about this stuff and what's expected on visits. (Ex: let her call if she's having a bad day.)

A court can, and will, interfere if they think that in the interests of the child, and they will almost always think it in the best interests of the child to have as good a relationship as possible with each parent in the absence of risk/abuse to the child. That is what OP is facing. While you are right that it is about Maudie\u2019s best interests, you are wrong if you think that this means the same thing as \u201cwhat Maddie wants\u201d. It doesn\u2019t. It *is* in Maddie\u2019s best interests to have a relationship with her mother. OP most certainly has to worry about looking bad if he is not facilitating a relationship with her mother and alienating Maddie against her mother. That is the sort of thing that can have drastic consequences on custody arrangements. However, if he takes steps to try and facilitate that relationship, and helps Maddie understand things chances are that the Court won\u2019t interfere with the arrangements. *BUT* it does depend on him doing what is right for Maddie to help her have that relationship, within the bounds of what she can handle - hence the therapy and expert reports to help identify precisely what those boundaries are, and it also depends upon a sufficient relationship of trust being built up between Maddie\u2019s mother and OP. Supervised access should be possible at the very least, until trust is restored.", "I\u2019m not dictating anything- the English language does that. That is what the meaning of the word is. Outside of adoption, that is also the legal definition of the word. There\u2019s little point getting uppity with me for pointing it out. As much as you would like to redefine words, they have real meaning. Their meanings do not lessen the importance of any of the roles to kids.

Bio mom chose to visit Maddy at most once a month.  She prioritized the children in her home, and not Maddy.\n\nMaddy has now expressed fear around bio mom after bio mom's own angry behavior, and does not wish to see her.  OP is respecting the wishes of his emotionally fragile (and medically diagnosed) child.\n\nOP has provided a stable home life and has a partner that Maddy has securely bonded with.

Maddy barely knows her, compared to the parent she lives with every day.  Bio mom has not and can not provide a stable home environment.\n\nA court is always going to prioritize maintaining the stable home that the minor child has lived the majority of their life and the history of parental care.  While courts do not look fondly on parents who attempt to interfere with the other parent's custodial rights, OP has full custody, and the mother has rarely even exercised her visitation rights.  What you see as a ding against him in custody court is up against a giant wall of evidence that supports his case to retain sole custody.\n\nThe court MIGHT give the mother supervised visitation.  But that would be on a court approved schedule, which is unlikely to work for a parent who can currently only squeeze in once a month at a day's notice.  And if a court psychologist gets involved, it is equally likely that the court denies visitation.\n\nRegardless, OP was previously allowing visitation unsupervised at a day's notice.

Which in this case means that OP has been the sole guardian for FIVE years.  During which time, bio mom has infrequently chosen to exercise her right to visitation at all times.\n\nCourts look at history of care and prioritize maintaining the stability of the home the child has known. Maddy has no home with her mother. She has no room at her mother's house.  No regularly predictable visitation with her mother. All Maddy has is whenever Kathy decides to visit at a day's notice, which happens less than once a month.\n\nNo court is going to view removing Maddy from the stable home she has had for the past FIVE YEARS as being in the best interests of the child. OP's case for custody is as solid as it gets.\n\nCourts do not like it when parents interfere with the other's custodial rights.  But OP has full custody.  Based on the post, it doesn't even sound like the custody order gave Kathy visitation, it is just what he promised her.  And he gave it to her for FIVE years, while she barely exercised it.  An absentee mother who barely visits is, at best, going to get supervised visitation from the court.  Scheduled by the court, which is unlikely to work well for a mom who can't make the time, with all of her other children's schedules, to see Maddy once a month.  So again - the OP does not really stand to lose if this gets taken to court.  He had been allowing her visitation at a day's notice.

These actions are grounds for supervised visitation, because your daughter was that uncomfortable. \n\nNTA, protect your kid from her because she can\u2019t just decide and dictate terms when she\u2019s only a parent once a month.\n\nI\u2019m also a petty bitch and would take her to court for child support (if you\u2019re not getting any??) since the conditions of the custody agreement are because she wasn\u2019t putting your kid in situations that were in her best interest.", "OP you need to document all of this if you haven\u2019t, have your kid in regular therapy if you don\u2019t (unbiased opinions are great for court) and document every visit (1x month won\u2019t look good). Tell her to contact your lawyer. The fact that your kid hid herself in a cabinet was already enough to me. Your ex is a horrible excuse for a parent and if it were ME I would be going to court to make sure she has ZERO unsupervised visitation NTA", "NTA", "NTA at all.  You are way good.\n\nYou should however imho do what you can to help mend this situation between Maddy and her mom however possible\u2026.  I would even suggest a parenting coordinator, counselor or even guardian ad litem though to help establish rules though.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA\n\n...but get ready for the legal fees.", "nta", "NTA", "A few random thoughts from this post...\n\nAre you the A for wanting to safeguard your child? No.  You are, however,  right to be concerned for being a potential A since you are contemplating cutting off your child's relationship with her bio mother over concerns of comfort and not safety.  \n\nI definitely second the idea of getting professionals involved to structure appropriate visitation.  It sounds like Kathy tries to maintain contact, even if she stumbles on how she goes about it. I've heard nothing to say Kathy is a danger to your child,  wishes her harm or would fail to protect her. \nConsider the distinction between Kathy needing training to parent a special needs kid in a healthy way versus Kathy being a safety concern that requires supervision. \n Be cautious of acting unilaterally without legal authority to withhold your child from her mother. \n Oh,  and odds are,  a parent can legally withhold a cell phone from a child, absent further, specific court order.", "NTA this! Take preventive steps now.", "Fully agree and OP is NTA and a fantastic parent. \n\nIs denying Kathy visitation a legal worry, similar to denying Maddy the phone? Jw, not saying you would know this for sure", "Denying the opportunity to see her? He let them go to the zoo together and she somehow fucked that up.", "Go back and look at OP\u2019s title.  He didn\u2019t ask about what he already did. He\u2019s asking if he doesn\u2019t let her see the kid again (which he did when she came to his house ranting).  If OP denies the bio mom seeing her child he runs into legal issues.  He needs to stick to whatever agreement they had regarding custody because whether she\u2019s a crap mom or not, courts will hold it against him if he violates a custody order.  He needs to document things on his end if he wants to change that agreement and further restrict contact.", " When MADDY is ready, you might want to offer for Kathy to visit while you are present", "\ud83d\ude02", "The people who downvoted you have no idea how Family Court works.\n\nBest interest for the child is frequent and regular contact with each parent, unless a parent poses a safety concern.\n\nThe incident in the zoo would make the court more likely than not put a side eye on BOTH parents: on dad for having created a situation where he lets the child call a so \u201cmommy\u201d (which is not particularly liked in Court), and that is at least borderline gatekeeping/parental alienation (what can be euphemised as \u201cgiving a lifeline\u201d can easily be rephrased as \u201cyour mom is so dangerous; you need a phone when you are with her all the time and call me at the slightest sign of discomfort to rescue you\u201d); and at mom for having put the child in the middle by removing the phone from her.\n\nMore appropriate than not seems to be some Family therapy in addition to visitation, and individual therapy for both parents to improve their ability to coparent.", "Yeah buddy point is that ship sailed. The kids obviously got special needs when it comes to interaction let alone confrontation", "Preventing her from contacting her custodial parent in the way he arranged for her?", "Correct. In these circumstances, that would not, in any  jurisdiction be considered kidnapping."]}
