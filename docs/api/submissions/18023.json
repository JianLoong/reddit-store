Now I am extremely proud of Kate for everything,  she's a kind person, works a high end job, and has a lot of great qualities.\n\nHowever, during my visit I noticed a few things and mentioned them to Kate. For instance, I noticed even though she is the only one working right now (Rosalie's currently a SAHM), she takes more care of the kids than Rosalie doesn. She's the one who plays with them (my other grandsom is 3) bathes them, changes diapers, etc. Kate also is the one who cooks more than half of the time, and almost always when she can.\n\nI told Kate I'd noticed she was shouldering a lot of the responsibilities and that Rosalie maybe needed to help her a little bit more around the house. Kate is always tired because some nights she stays up to help the baby sleep and goes to work too.\n\nWhen I told her this, she took a lot of offense. Kate said she this was not a competition, that Rosalie gave birth twice and needed to regain her energy during this time, and be appreciated. She mentioned the simplest things Rosalie does around the house, like watering their plants (takes less than 10 minutes) and tried to convince me that she also does help out. She does help take care of the kids but still, Kate takes care of most chores and night time. \n\nI simply mentioned that Kate needed to think of her own health too. She told me she thought of herself and her family as a package and asked me to never comment about these things again. I agreed, and kept my word. I just watched as Kate got more and more tired every day while she helped out.\n\nEven after I came back, Kate hasnt been as warm towards me ever since. She calls every now and then, and is noticably still upset with me.

If she is working a job then she isnt home all the time so her partner would be taking care of the children too. Back off!", "YTA.  You meant well, but you basically insulted her wife and judged her life when she didn't ask your opinion.", "YTA\n\nKate is happy with how her home functions and it's not on you to disrupt that. \n\nAdditionally, all that stuff Kate is doing when she is home, Rosalie is doing when she is not. Pretty unkind of you to paint Rosalie as not doing her fair share.

And you say Kate cooks half the time, so who is cooking the other half? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s Rosalie, right?\n\nYou say Kate handles a lot of the night time stuff. Are you expecting that after spending all day taking care of the kids, Rosalie should also have to do the night routine stuff as well? When does she get a break?", "YTA. Isn't Rosalie the one who watches the kids all day while your daughter is working? They are 1 & 3 it's impossible that your daughter is working and doing the bulk of the childcare. She may be doing more in the evening but Rosalie has them all day. \n\nRosalie could also be dealing with physical or mental health (like PPD or PPA) issues that are absolutely none of your business. Lack of sleep can worsen those issues and so it may be necessary for your daughter to help more at night so Rosalie can get the rest she needs to have the kids all day.\n\nHonestly, whatever the reason they've chosen split their labor at home the way they have it's none of your business.", "YTA. It's not your place to say how their household should be run. Of course she's tired, she's a mom, a wife, and works. That doesn't mean it's her wife's fault, or that she doesn't do enough.\n\nYou owe her a sincere apology.", "YTA - Your submission read as judgmental with finite detail and that is what your daughter experienced. Follow her request to never raise the subject again. This is a clear boundary you'd be wise to respect.", "YTA\nKate should be taking on more of the responsibility of caring for the kids at night since Rosalie is home taking care of them all day. It\u2019s not your business to judge how they run their household.", "You are the sweet asshole.  You just overstepped. It happens to all moms of adult kids at some point or other. \n\nYour daughter is right though. It's not a competition. There are seasons where one person in the relationship does more than the other. Life is exhausting for everybody when the kids are this small. \n\nGone are the days where a SAHM does all the child rearing and housework. Now there seems to be more of a  division of labor after work hours, so cooking 50% of the time and bedtime routine sounds pretty fair actually. \n\nSo I want to say NTA because your intentions were protective and motherly, but I have to stick with YTA for overstepping.", "NTA you were looking out for your daughter.  You didn't tell her to get a divorce. You voiced your concerns and left it at that. She should be happy she has someone looking out for her. She'll appreciate it one day, I promise!", "YTA. Why are you butting in with your opinion on a couple's division of chores? Why did you feel the need to insult both your daughter and her wife over a situation you don't know all the details of? Why are you treating your 33-year-old as if she were incapable of discussing this with her wife if it bothers her? BTW, they're both working; one is going to a job and the other is providing child care, which for two under 3 could eat up a second salary. It sounds like Rosalie, who recently gave birth, is doing the child care work during the day while your daughter is working. If this works for them, why do you need to act like you know better?", "YTA. Clearly you don't like your DIL or respect their marriage.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
