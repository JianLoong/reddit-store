Now I am extremely proud of Kate for everything,  she's a kind person, works a high end job, and has a lot of great qualities.\n\nHowever, during my visit I noticed a few things and mentioned them to Kate. For instance, I noticed even though she is the only one working right now (Rosalie's currently a SAHM), she takes more care of the kids than Rosalie doesn. She's the one who plays with them (my other grandsom is 3) bathes them, changes diapers, etc. Kate also is the one who cooks more than half of the time, and almost always when she can.\n\nI told Kate I'd noticed she was shouldering a lot of the responsibilities and that Rosalie maybe needed to help her a little bit more around the house. Kate is always tired because some nights she stays up to help the baby sleep and goes to work too.\n\nWhen I told her this, she took a lot of offense. Kate said she this was not a competition, that Rosalie gave birth twice and needed to regain her energy during this time, and be appreciated. She mentioned the simplest things Rosalie does around the house, like watering their plants (takes less than 10 minutes) and tried to convince me that she also does help out. She does help take care of the kids but still, Kate takes care of most chores and night time. \n\nI simply mentioned that Kate needed to think of her own health too. She told me she thought of herself and her family as a package and asked me to never comment about these things again. I agreed, and kept my word. I just watched as Kate got more and more tired every day while she helped out.\n\nEven after I came back, Kate hasnt been as warm towards me ever since. She calls every now and then, and is noticably still upset with me.

Isn't Rosalie the one who watches the kids all day while your daughter is working? They are 1 & 3 it's impossible that your daughter is working and doing the bulk of the childcare. She may be doing more in the evening but Rosalie has them all day. \n\nRosalie could also be dealing with physical or mental health (like PPD or PPA) issues that are absolutely none of your business. Lack of sleep can worsen those issues and so it may be necessary for your daughter to help more at night so Rosalie can get the rest she needs to have the kids all day.\n\nHonestly, whatever the reason they've chosen split their labor at home the way they have it's none of your business.", "YTA.

It happens to all moms of adult kids at some point or other. \n\nYour daughter is right though. It's not a competition. There are seasons where one person in the relationship does more than the other. Life is exhausting for everybody when the kids are this small. \n\nGone are the days where a SAHM does all the child rearing and housework. Now there seems to be more of a  division of labor after work hours, so cooking 50% of the time and bedtime routine sounds pretty fair actually. \n\nSo I want to say NTA because your intentions were protective and motherly, but I have to stick with YTA for overstepping.", "NTA you were looking out for your daughter.

Why are you butting in with your opinion on a couple's division of chores? Why did you feel the need to insult both your daughter and her wife over a situation you don't know all the details of? Why are you treating your 33-year-old as if she were incapable of discussing this with her wife if it bothers her? BTW, they're both working; one is going to a job and the other is providing child care, which for two under 3 could eat up a second salary. It sounds like Rosalie, who recently gave birth, is doing the child care work during the day while your daughter is working.
