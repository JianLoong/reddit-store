We have a good relationship, we can talk about absolutely anything. She is the best friend I have ever had. Now she decided to go on a solo vacation to turkey this summer, she travels a lot. Offered to take me with her on the trip, offered to pay for it too. But I have a summer course and it just doesn\u2019t work. I am a full time college student and have a yearly salary around $6,000. Now she is at turkey right now, and sent me a message asking for me to pay for a business class flight home for her. That\u2019s around $2,000. No way is that smart for me to do, so I just offered to help out some. I said I would give her $500 towards it. Well apparently since she was willing to spend thousands of dollars on me and I only offered 500 that makes it a one sided relationship. I don\u2019t know but she makes 3k from disability per month + a full time job. While $500 may not seem like a lot to her it is a months salary for me. She is now resenting me when I\u2019ve only ever showed love to her. I take her out to dozens of restaurants, I take her to aquariums, the beach, you name it. We have good times.\n\nEdit: I have a high net worth for my age but I\u2019m trying to invest and save it, so I only use what I make. (She figured out by seeing my hobbies)\n\nEdit 2: She openly goes on dates with old guys for free food. \n\nEdit 3: She did give me a place to sleep at for a couple weeks, she has spent on me. \n\nEdit 4: I told her that I wasn\u2019t ok with her seeing other guys. Also said how I didn\u2019t like how she didn\u2019t appreciate my offer because it wasn\u2019t enough money. She said that the other guys she talks to don\u2019t disrespect her like that and I guess it\u2019s over now. It\u2019s crazy to me because those guys she talks to are absolute dirtbags. \n\nEdit 5: If anyone is able to talk with me for a little while that would nice.\n\nEdit 6: Thanks everyone, my heart isn\u2019t broken.

You're worth good things, though; everyone has intrinsic worth & value as human beings.\n\nIf meeting people IRL is hard, maybe try making friends online?
