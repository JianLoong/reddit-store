We have a good relationship, we can talk about absolutely anything. She is the best friend I have ever had. Now she decided to go on a solo vacation to turkey this summer, she travels a lot. Offered to take me with her on the trip, offered to pay for it too. But I have a summer course and it just doesn\u2019t work. I am a full time college student and have a yearly salary around $6,000. Now she is at turkey right now, and sent me a message asking for me to pay for a business class flight home for her. That\u2019s around $2,000. No way is that smart for me to do, so I just offered to help out some. I said I would give her $500 towards it. Well apparently since she was willing to spend thousands of dollars on me and I only offered 500 that makes it a one sided relationship. I don\u2019t know but she makes 3k from disability per month + a full time job. While $500 may not seem like a lot to her it is a months salary for me. She is now resenting me when I\u2019ve only ever showed love to her. I take her out to dozens of restaurants, I take her to aquariums, the beach, you name it. We have good times.\n\nEdit: I have a high net worth for my age ~60k but I\u2019m trying to invest and save it, so I only use what I make.\n\nEdit 2: She openly goes on dates with old guys for free food. \n\nEdit 3: She went to turkey for a nose job.

I'm not sure I would say the thing about investing, as it is true that we all invest our time and money (which is just a by-product of our time) into relationships hoping they will result in something greater, but in this context she will take it literally as you mean it and I think you're making the money the issue when it's really all the stuff behind the money that's the issue. Good luck (on your next relationship). I suggest you take a few months and reflect on what got you involved with such a person, what were the warning signs that you can learn from that will help you avoid getting hooked up with a person like this.
