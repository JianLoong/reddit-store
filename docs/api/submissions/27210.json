It would have been wrong for you to stay silent", "NTA - I fully expected this to be a \"You're a first year student, you have no clue\" kind of moment, but no, you came out the gate with a really good example of assholery. Good on you for reporting that shit, it's not funny, it's abusive of folks who are unable to defend themselves.\n\nYou seem to truly care for these people, and I hope you never lose that, they need folks like you to stand up for them against bullys and assholes like the ones you were shadowing.", "NTA you were absolutely right to say something. Imagine that this behavior has been going on for 3 years and nobody knew. You are taking care of people who rely on you/your colleagues for safety and care. This colleague, at a minimum, was showing extreme disrespect. At the worst, he could've actually caused bodily harm. Maybe he has in the past, and it was not witnessed.", "NTA.  The people he is doing this to have no means of filing a complaint on their own, so it's up to you. In addition, the fact that he did this during a shadow shift suggests he was testing your boundaries and that he's probably doing much worse.  You may have failed his test, but you passed the one that matters.", "NTA. \n\nIf it's genuinely a fun relationship he has with his clients then that will come out of the investigation. \n\nBut it could be something much worse and its good that you're advocating for people who may not know that this behaviour isn't necessarily okay.", "NTA! I completely support reporting abuse. Imagine what he does to those people when no one is looking!! You are a good person, op.", "NTA. I'd be concerned about a person who sees incapacitated people as fun play things having access to female patients. I'm glad you reported it as required by law.", "NTA\n\nReport them a second time just to be sure.", "NTA that is super inappropriate and should be disciplined. One of my sisters is fully handicapped and shit like this is why I hesitate over finding a care facility once my parents can't take care of her anymore.", "Nta. Better safe than sorry.
