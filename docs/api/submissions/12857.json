You need to leave.\n\nMe: oh, she's a service dog, so she's allowed to be in here.\n\nLady: stop lying. You're not disabled, so you don't need a service dog. You should give it to someone who's actually disabled.\n\nMe, trying to stay somewhat calm: she's a psychiatric service dog-\n\nThe lady interrupts me saying: it doesn't matter what kind of service dog she is. It's disgusting and you need to leave.\n\nSince I was basically finished with my meal, I decided to just go instead of getting in an argument. I nodded, stood up, waved to the staff and left to do some shopping.
