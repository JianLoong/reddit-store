But I suspect that doesn't legally qualify her as a dog under the legislation.  But I'm not a lawyer...so who knows.", ">*\u201cin the UK it\u2019s illegal to harm, harass, assault, or otherwise interfere with an assistance dog.

If they want to or encounters them again (hopefully not) OP at least knows their options now.", "She also followed her for no reason and that could classify as the definition of stalking", "NTA. You did nothing wrong, you just met a \u201c.  \u201c in the wild, and she accosted and assaulted you and your service dog. You showed so much restraint- I doubt I could have.", "NTA.  But the thing wrong you did was not clobbering her with your bag and knocking her on her .......  what the actual hell?!?  Are people JUST THAT dumb?", "NTA\nThis really pisses me off. I have epilepsy, I am lucky enough to have my seizures medically controlled & I \"don't look like I'm disabled,\" (whatever the hell that means). If i had a service dog and someone yanked him away from me, well let's just say that taking a ride through satans skidmarked skivvies would be preferable to the hellfire I would rain down upon them.", "NTA she clearly has problems and the moment she grabbed the harness you should have had her arrested considering the cost of a service dog you can argue it's grand theft.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA OP!  I hope that your stalker (going by the fact that she followed you from the cafe, I think that this is the right term to use for what she did) not only gets banned from the cafe, but that she is put on a watch list, so that other businesses in the area are alerted to what she might do.", "NTA. Unfortunately, in many scenarios in life there will be individuals who appoint themselves as minsters of protocol. It's her and her responsibility alone to say what should and should happen. What disability is real or imaginary. You did nothing wrong. It seems you were subjected to an ordeal that this officious woman made worse. I often see dogs in places where I am startled at finding a dog there. But the dogs are seated and quiet. I go about my business, no questions asked.", "I agree. What happened in the store may not have been attention seeking but OP's post is.", "Get the video recording from the shop immediately before it\u2019s deleted!", "I\u2019m very sorry this happened to you! It must have been so traumatic. The huge number of crazy/stupid people out there is disheartening! I can\u2019t imagine being fragile and and in public and some random weirdo screams at you and pulls on your dog. What a nightmare! Somebody sees you with your service animal, and based on no evidence whatsoever decides that you are taking advantage of the system. They just can\u2019t have that! They stand for truth! Full of outrage, determined to make the world a better place one fake service dog at a time, they march over to tell you that you don\u2019t LOOK disabled. What are you supposed to do now, share your whole medical history with a stranger, while they scream back at you that you\u2019re lying?? These smug shits who zero in on disabled people and their dogs are the lowest of humanity.", "Deep pressure therapy! Psychiatric service dogs are trained to use their weight and warmth to comfort their distressed human (per google!)", "It\u2019s super weird to try and diagnose and rank mental illnesses based on an AITA post.", "Kind of reminds me of that recent-ish AITA post where the OP left their service dog in the yard during a game night or something because of their rude ass \u201cfriend\u201d who also said they only had the dog for attention. And lo\u2019 and behold, the OP fainted with no alert from their medical device and hit their head on a table on the way down. \n\nThen there\u2019s *this* gem, lady was not only completely unhinged in general (both based on her interaction with OP and the fact that there\u2019ve apparently been \u201cother complaints about her doing stuff like this\u201d **wtf?!**), but also could\u2019ve literally caused another medical incident for OP.
