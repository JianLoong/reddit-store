Obligatory, on mobile.\n\nI was sitting in a local cafe having some lunch, with my service dog, Ruby, underneath the table and out of the way. I go there a lot so the staff either have met me or have heard of me having Ruby. I've had some complaints from the other customers about being in a cafe with a dog, but once I explain that she's a service dog, they normally smile, nod and then leave us alone. This wasn't the case today.\n\nAs I'm eating, a lady comes up to my table and huffs and puffs until I look up from where I was reading on my phone. This is how the conversation went:\n\nMe: can I help you?\n\nLady: yes, actually. Dogs shouldn't be in here. You need to leave.\n\nMe: oh, she's a service dog, so she's allowed to be in here.\n\nLady: stop lying. You're not disabled, so you don't need a service dog. You should give it to someone who's actually disabled.\n\nMe, trying to stay somewhat calm: she's a psychiatric service dog-\n\nThe lady interrupts me saying: it doesn't matter what kind of service dog she is. It's disgusting and you need to leave.\n\nSince I was basically finished with my meal, I decided to just go instead of getting in an argument. I nodded, stood up, waved to the staff and left to do some shopping. The lady followed me, for some reason, but I didn't notice until after. \n\nAs I walked down an aisle, an employee dropped something, which smashed. Ruby alerted before i even knew what was happening, leading me away from the broken glass. I sat down and Ruby did DPT until I was able to stand back up again without shaking. \n\nWhen I headed to finished my shopping, someone grabbed Ruby's harness handle and forcefully yanked it out from my hand. I, understandably, screamed at them to let go before I turned around and who do I see but the entitled lady from before. \n\nI yank the harness back towards me, all the while she was yelling about how I'm faking and just doing this to attention seek. I'm trying to stay calm and explain that you cant just take someone's service dog, but can't get a word in without being interrupted or talked over.\n\nThe security guard from before came to talk to everyone there. Since I couldn't say much apart from a simple yes or no, it took a while to get any answers. But the lady was escorted out in the end, still screeching and trying to make one last grab for Ruby.\n\nI finished my shopping in a sort of daze and took a taxi home, but am still wondering if I did something wrong during this whole ordeal.
