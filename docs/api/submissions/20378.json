Not sure what would be additionally expected of him to not be an A here.", "[deleted]", "Id suspect he's upset you're unemployed and hired a maid", "he works all day and you stay at home and you expect him to cook and clean for you too? maybe put your feet in his shoes and try and feel how tiring and exhausted he is, bc you already stated above that he\u2019s always tired.", "Cooking is a basic life skill. Learn! Your husband is putting in long hours to provide for you and you\u2019re okay with him coming home to cook for you and keep up with half the housework?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a matter of sex and gender roles but a fair division of chores. He\u2019s putting in his hours and you should, too. Watch some YouTube videos, learn a thing or two about cooking and step up. Keep the house tidy, prepare meals on the days he\u2019s working, and start contributing and be a team player.\n\nEdit: YTA.", "You have STARTED looking for a new job ?  Didn't you do that the end of last year ?\n\nI've found one for you...\n\nYou can be a maid !", "YTA. WTF are you doing with all your time if you're not working? You lost your job last year, so you've been free for about half a year. I don't see any mention of kids.", "Ooof someone\u2019s lazy. Hint\u2026it\u2019s not your husband.", "You're  home all day and still can't have dinner ready?  Instapot,  crackpot....it's  not hard\nYTA", "Then YTA.", "Okay, now tell us what you do all day. Are you looking for a job?", "Turns out she\u2019s unemployed and has been since the end of last year. Expecting him to do half the chores when he\u2019s working all day and 100% in charge of keeping them afloat financially is just ridiculous.", "Might have missed this, but it says nowhere in the text that OP doesnt have a fulltime job.\n\nIf she doesn't work, then ofc she is TA", "I don't know, where are you getting this info ?  Nothing about it in the OP.", "Uh no, you're making things up. My husband didn't have to 'take up' extra work to cover expenses, we're financially sound. He's an attorney and is currently working on a big case, so the extra time at work. He's not 'taking up' anything, this is just what his job's like.\n\nAnd I'm not expecting him to follow the chore distribution, I understand he can't keep up with it. Not once did I tell him he has to do the work. I only hired a maid to help out. I still do what I need to do", "Seriously ?  You're going to downvote me for what I wrote before anyone knew she was unemployed and refusing to take on some extra chores ?", "Relax from what, exactly? What kind of \"work\" are you doing, since you don't have a traditional job nor do you do housework?", "Does he get time to relax?", "How much time do you need to relax? You\u2019re lazy", "How much mess can two adults make? I have two adults, three tweens/teenagers, a dog and a cat and the housework doesn't take that much time. You literally have every hour of every day to relax. If you need a maid you should pay for it. He is already supporting you 100% and you don't want to do what can't be more than an hour of housework a day? You are lazy and entitled.", "bro you are a bum , either get a job or pay for it yourself", "Woman, come on, get your lazy ass of the couch", "ummmm NO, youre in the wrong here.", "What are you relaxing from?", "Yeah buddy, cooking and cleaning for your husband is STILL WOEK", "I wouldn't say it necessarily does. What else does she do? Are there kids in the house? Other responsibilities. Does she have a medical issue or injury that makes certain things difficult. There is a reason they previously had a split of chores, and that needs to be addressed rather than just \"she doesn't work\" because domestic labour *is* work. It's just only ever paid when it's outside help doing the work.", "Funny how she forgot to mention  she doesn't have a job ans is home all day", "Actually I think she should do all the household chores for a more equitable division of labour. Because on average, house hold chores take 3 hours every day which 21 hours per week and almost half the average working hour per perk. So OP already gets way more time to relax than her husband and it looks like that now the husband works more than an the average amount.", "Did the same thing, what are you doing all day if your not working and have no kids? And why is the house even getting so dirty if you have no kids? I am so confused unless this is some straight up mansion clean the house.", "For real. I'm also a woman and find this attitude ridiculous. It'd be another situation if they worked the same amount or if she also had kids to take care of. But it seems neither is the situation at hand.", "She's been unemployed for the last 6 months so there is that to be taken into account.", "and rightly so.", "Yeah, I hate cooking. But I know how to follow a damn recipe or I can always throw some pasta together. I'm lucky that right now my husband is a SAHD while I work, and he takes care of cooking, cleaning, and our child. When I get home, I take over watching the baby so he can go to the gym and then cook dinner. \n\nBut if/when he gets a job? That'll have to change. Whether I take on more cleaning or we hire someone will be a discussion, but either way I would never expect him to handle the household AND a job.", "I presume that may be why she lost her job.", "She addressed it in a comment. Not only does she not work, but she expects her husband to do much of the cleaning AND all the cooking. And she complains when he makes simple things like sandwiches.", "I was wrong about the husband taking up extra work but he does do extra work.....\nalso in the comments... OO mentioned that they still follow the chore distribution from when they were both working.", "You hired a maid with what money? You have zero income. So presumably he\u2019s paying for the maid, so he is 1) bringing in all the income 2) doing all the cooking 3) paying for the house to be cleaned while you\u2026\u201drelax\u201d. \n\nHow do YOU think this looks? Objectively? You tell me how you aren\u2019t a lazy freeloader in this situation, please tell us how you are contributing anything at all to the relationship?", "So you've been married for less than a year and you are already an unemployed bum hiring maids whilst you \"relax\"? \n\nIn future just sign up to a sugar daddy website or something instead of making this poor guy think he is in a real relationship.", "Oh I apologise for that but...The chore distribution was for when both of you were working, i.e both of you were exhausted from a long day of work. Now that you are at home, and do not work much, other than at home, you are expected to cover up for him. I mean, he's the only one earning now and you are not. Unless and until you're paying from YOUR own savings, which is not tied to your husband's, YTA.", "Obviously you do not do what you need to do because you've hired a maid instead. What you need to do is pick up the temporary slack while your husband is busy and you aren't working.", "Why are you only responding to comments about his behavior and none of yours?", "Yes, because deciding to pay a maid with your SO money without talking to him/her first, is already a A-hole move.", "yes but in the comments she\u2019s saying she wants HIM to do all the cooking (she\u2019s a bad cook) and still an equal amount of chores when he still has an exhausting job", "But...she doesn't do that. She's hiring someone to do it. That's the point.", "For two adults and no kids, that\u2019s like 2 hours at best every day", "I'm sure she would've mentioned if they had kids or she had some sort of injury.\n\nNo one is saying doing household chores isn't work. Before he got a heavier workload at his job, the husband worked full time + did half the housework. OP just did the other half, no other job. \n\nEven using your reasoning, the husband always did more work paid or unpaid. \n\nNow she can't chip in a bit more despite still having no job, while the husband works to support them both financially and still doing as much of the housework as he can.", "She is not doing domestic labor either, though. That's the problem. No kids mentioned, she can't do the housework, so what is she contributing to the household?? The average person has to keep up with housework on top of either working or taking care of children. She does NONE of the above and STILL needs to hire professional help. I think if there was a medical issue she would have mentioned it.", "She commented she needs time to relax, not the job search, not for her mental health she needs time to relax", "Woman here too.   \nPeople voting N T A just because of the gender are even more despicable than OP.  \n\n\nY'all give us all a bad name. This is NOT feminism. This is toxicity.  \n\n\nBe better.", "I just edited my comment.", "This sounds like reddit gold :) \n\nChecking these comments, *grabs popcorn*", "Yeah, that's in the COMMENTS, none of which was here when I started typing a response to her BRAND NEW POST. It's obvious by the time logs.", "she mentioned it in the post that the husband told her that if she wanted a maid then she should use her savings. She said that is unfair for her", "According to her OP, that never happened.  \n\nHer OP says that he said if she really needs a maid, just pay out of her own money.  That means they talked about it. \n\nAgain, I think she misrepresented the whole thing here.  I am not sympathetic to her tale of woe since getting more of the story. \n\nI just prefer you stop attacking me as if I did something wrong.", "I know", "Woman here as well. I'm a SAHW, soon to be a SAHM. When my husband was working (his doctor and I are currently trying to talk him into going on disability because of various health issues) I took over the household chores 100%. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, you name it. Now that he's home, we split the chores as best we can.\n\nI've always maintained that it's not about gender. It's about putting in your fair share of the work. The only time we considered hiring a maid was for right after I give birth and at the time it was under the assumption that my husband was still going to be working full-time. So, I don't get the people declaring OP as anything but TA. Cleaning up after two people isn't really that difficult.", "Going off OP's comments, she lost her job at the end of last year and she's been married for less than a year, so she's been unemployed for majority of the marriage. She also mentions her husband is an attorney and they're financially well off. And she's only started looking for a job now. I wouldn't be surprised if her plan was to become a SAHW (but without actually contributing anything to the household, because she can just hire a maid with the attorney money) and live the high life.", "Many of the people said N T A before knowing she's currently unemployed. \n\nI just checked the comments myself, and I'm inclined to say NAH. Y'all are being insanely harsh on the OP. \n\nAll these comments assuming OP is lazy is just gross. People can lose jobs for a number of reasons out of their control, and it isn't exactly easy to find a new one in the current market. Believe it or not, job hunting can take up time and energy. Maybe she had an injury or mental health issues - also believe it or not, but things like ADHD are often not properly diagnosed in women. \n\nNo one is saying she should be allowed to do nothing because she's a woman? She's *not* doing nothing. She's still doing her share of the chores. She didn't force him to work when he's tired, she just hired a maid. How does that harm anyone?", "\"I decided to...\"\n\nMy point stands. \n\n*lowering visor and take a running start to attack you*\n\nIt looks like we just have different opinions about this topic and it's fine to disagree. But if you feel attacked b  my comment, please take care of yourself while wandering around the Internet, it's dangerous out there.", "YTA: She shouldn't be committing that much of their joint money without asking him. That in itself makes her an AH. If she needed the help -- for which I offer no judgment; we have hired household help too, because with the various chronic illness is my household we probably *could*, with a lot of difficulty, get all the chores done ourselves, but none of us want to wear ourselves out that much. \n\nWe made that as a joint decision, with all adults in the household agreeing that we can afford it. Deciding it unilaterally and just doing it, without talking it over first with the other partner, is an AH move.", "If you are imagining reasons, then you want info and not make a judgement."]}
