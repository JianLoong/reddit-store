Just dumping the extra work on you and expecting you to just do it is not right.~~\n\n~~N T A~~\n\nSo OP not working now, and the division of labor being made while she was working changes... pretty much everything. \n\nSince the OP is not working outside the home, than she needs to take on the work inside the home. The division of labor may be 80-20 in terms of chorse, but you also then have to factor in work. She is doing 0% of the that labor, while her husband is doing 100% of it. So that then evens out all work being done. \n\nYTA", "The judgement in this comment section is laughable.", "NTA if you can afford to hire a maid. While you are both working, who wouldn't like this option to free up valuable time and avoid resentment?", "I wonder if people here realize how common it is to hire help to clean. Not everyone was raised to clean and pick up after another person. It\u2019s her own workload that she feels overwhelmed by and frankly, who are we to judge. If your husband is generally messy or expects you to cook (and clean up afterwards) then makes sense to hire some help. Husband asking you to go into your own savings is kinda individualistic for something that would benefit both of you. What do you need the maid for? To pick up here and there or to deep clean your home frequently? Also is your home fairly large? If we\u2019re talking about a 800sqft apartment or a 1200sfq home, hiring a maid may be overkill. \n\nNTA, husband sounds kinda rude.

With you not working right now, he might be expecting or depending on you to pick up the slack. You are both adults and have responsibilities. Morr than likely, he assumes that if he is supporting you financially, then for now, your job is the house. \nBut when you start working again, I suggest revisiting the need for a maid. \nThe fact that you haven't mentioned what chores you do or what you fill your day with leaves me with some reservations.\nTalk with your spouse about the division of labor around the house.

Sometimes, people forget what goes into maintaining a household.

Yet he freaks the F out if I even begin to suggest that he do even a TINY bit of the housework.  One of a million reasons we're getting divorced.", "Yes. I was sympathetic to her needing help when I was assuming she also had a full time job. I still was a mild YTA, though, because I think hiring help should be a mutual decision. She did it without discussing it first, which is not ok. There's the expense and there's also letting someone into your house. I think both partners need to agree on that.\n\nHer not having outside work put me very firmly in the YTA camp. If you're the stay-at-home partner, the house is primarily your job. There is room for flexibility in there, especially if the home load is high, like if you have small kids, or special needs kids, or other things that create a lot of work or stress, or if you have a disability. Nothing like that was mentioned.  \n\nI had a few months between jobs once. It's just my husband and me, no children. We also did have a cleaner that came every other week at this time as I normally worked 40+ hours a week. We still had her coming out of personal loyalty even though we didn't need her with me home, so this would be similar to OPs situation. My husband normally shares the domestic work, so I viewed my break from outside work as an opportunity for him to have a break from house work. I did all the cooking (more complex cooking than normal), all the daily cleaning. I gardened. I organized all the closets, the books, anything I could lay my mitts on, and it was still less than a part time job. The cleaner came for 4 hours every other week. Even if I took twice as long to do the same work, I would still be looking at maybe 25-30 hours a week of work keeping my house and garden pristine and super organized, cooking fabulous meals, without my husband lifting a finger. About 2 hours a day of that was the cooking, too. Plus, by the end of that time at home, I had run out of special cleaning projects and was in maintenance mode. If I hadn't been heading back to a job, I would've needed to pick up some more volunteer work or plant crops or something.", "SAAAME. I was like, \u201cWow! Why are people shitting on this poor woman? I bet when she finishes her own workday\u2014or she\u2019s been watching the kids by herself for hours\u2014she\u2019s exhausted. Let her hire a housekeeper, for goodness sake.\u201d But THEN I saw the comments, and I realized she had neither a child nor a job, and I was like, \u201cOoooh \u2026\u201d", "The only justification I could think of would be if she was disabled. That being said, considering that she seemed to be trying to hide that she\u2019s not working I doubt she is disabled to the point she can\u2019t do more housework.", "I\u2019m doing that right now. Start laundry. Go the grocery store at 7:30 am because it\u2019s quiet. Flip laundry. Clean. More laundry. Clean. After lunch, work on my Triumphs on Destiny. Lol.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ve worked too long but I\u2019d enjoy it. Plus I\u2019d end up cleaning before the cleaner got there.", "Same. \n\nI normally cook breakfast for my wife and kids, tackle the dishes from that while they eat, go to work for 8-ish hours, after work I either cook dinner or play with the kids while my wife cooks dinner, and typically whomever is not tackling bath time does the dishes.\n\nSure I make all the money, but damn if watching those kids all day probably isn't harder than my job, even if it's not a salaried position.", "This. Now if the chores take over 40 hours then there can some sharing if the remaining responsibilities. \n\n\nA relationship is a team. I get not wanting to do all the chores but if you aren't working then yeah it falls on you. Now there are some exceptions like if you don't know how to mix the oil/gas for a two stroke motor for a lawn maintenance tools.", "Same here. I\u2019ll let you borrow three cats that will exponentially increase your workload \ud83d\udc80", "Truth. My wife went away the other weekend, got home on monday, and while we were eating dinner made a comment that \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t get around to doing the vacuuming?\n\nI in fact had done the vacuuming on Saturday morning and Monday evening, I had just finished turning the vacuum off when she walked in the door, and packed it up in front of her while she was putting her bag down\n\nWe have a three year old who got her toys back out and scattered them around the house, got a handful of rice and threw it on the couch/ floor in the lounge while I was cooking, went outside and dragged some dirt in across the carpet (all in between the time my wife got home and we sat down to eat). The place was a complete mess again an hour after it was cleaned", "Toddler 1 planted some tomato seeds in a plastic cup and brought them home to gift to me. Toddler 2 literally jumped on top of the cup, for no reason I can describe. Toddler 1 was pissed, and tackled toddler 2. This happened while I was in the bathroom. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why my second floor looks like that and why I'm bathing the kids in the middle of the afternoon", "Not planning on pets, eh?\n\nThough, with dogs there\u2019s less butter on the floor but 2x as many sticks in places.\n\nMy dumbass has 3.\n\nDogs, I mean. I definitely have way more than 3 sticks.", "YTA- So, let's get this cleared up. Your husband is a busy attorney and works a lot. You are unemployed. You both contributed to chores. Now that he is busier then normal, you want HIM to pay for the maid (seeing as he's the only one with an income) because in a typical day you are unable to keep up doing the basic things that everyone is responsible for . Hell, a lot of people are single and have to do that all on their own without a partner while working one or even two jobs. What chores take more than a standard days worth of work for a standard 40 hour week.(The minimal full-time work week.. seeing as you don't have one). \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 This is comical.", "Typical AITA redditor who decides to bury the lede by leaving out important information in the original post to get people to tell them NTA.", "The sad part is it's not even that much work if you keep a generally clean house. Yes, you obviously have to clean everything every once in a while but if you do it regularly there are never any hard areas you have to use a lot of energy on.", "I'd caveat that I do want to see why the OP is not currently employed. My assessment of the situation would alter significantly if it's for medical reasons or some other 'cannot work' that would also likely inhibit household maintenance capability.", "Just leaving my two cents here. I don't have a job and I do the majority of the chores at home. However, I have been considering hiring someone for just one day for a single week of the year just so I can have a week off where I don't have to do anything. Like a short vacation for myself (though knowing me I will help out anyway).  \nI don't think that makes me an asshole.\n\nHowever, if you sit around all day with nothing else to do and you plan on hiring someone to clean for you as a regular thing? Yeah, that makes YTA.", "I was surprised to see the top comment being YTA.  Until I read it.\n\nReally, really misleading post.  Yes, you should be doing the housework.  And I fully agree it doesn't matter about gender.  Usually we see jobless men laying about here, forcing the wife to earn the money and do the chores.  I guess women can be just as useless.", "I was if anyone else was thinking that, so true", "I have chronic pain & this is me, too. It makes me mad when people say that they are jealous that I stay home all day. I just want to take a damn shower without being exhausted. I would do anything to have a full time job.", "Then she\u2019s definitely the AH.", "Lol I watch Mr Tov on Instagram and he said when he moved from Nigeria to England(?) he saw a casting call audition for BBC and when he went there, he found out it was not the BBC as in media but the other abbreviation.

Steamed Broccoli. \n\nNot being able to cook is the saddest excuse in the book. It's not like you have to go hunt a deer, manage a kill, drag it back without attracting other animals, then butcher the deer, salt the meat for preservation, then cook it in a fragile clay pot over a shoddy fire.\n\nCooking has literally never been easier in the history of humanity. If you can't whip up a dish in 1 hour, then you failed as a functioning person. The only exceptions are extreme cases of health related issues that could prevent you from operating a kitchen safely, like blindness, wheelchair-bound, or risks of falling or seizures. At that point, whether it was a fluke from God or their own dumbass decisions, disabled people cannot be blamed for their inability to cook. \n\nIf you can walk to the bathroom and operate a phone, then you can wash your hands and pull out a skillet. \n\nNot to mention being able to operate a fucking *broom*.", "Exactly. I live alone and work full time.

After medical things settled down and all kids  in school I went back to work. First part time (and division of chores went to more like 80/20) and then full time and we just hired full time help then.
