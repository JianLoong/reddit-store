Do women still say \"maid\"? Do normal men even say \"maid\" anymore? Last time I heard maid instead of cleaner or housekeeper was at least 20 years ago. Just way too blase: Basically, \"I'm a leech and a stereotype, AITA?\"", "~~If it's not much work, than he can do it, as he is the one slipping on doing it on the first place.~~\n\n~~And if he doesn't have the time, or is too tired to do it, than he pay to have the work done. Just dumping the extra work on you and expecting you to just do it is not right.~~\n\n~~N T A~~\n\nSo OP not working now, and the division of labor being made while she was working changes... pretty much everything. \n\nSince the OP is not working outside the home, than she needs to take on the work inside the home. The division of labor may be 80-20 in terms of chorse, but you also then have to factor in work. She is doing 0% of the that labor, while her husband is doing 100% of it. So that then evens out all work being done. \n\nYTA", "The judgement in this comment section is laughable.", "NTA if you can afford to hire a maid. While you are both working, who wouldn't like this option to free up valuable time and avoid resentment?", "I wonder if people here realize how common it is to hire help to clean. Not everyone was raised to clean and pick up after another person. It\u2019s her own workload that she feels overwhelmed by and frankly, who are we to judge. If your husband is generally messy or expects you to cook (and clean up afterwards) then makes sense to hire some help. Husband asking you to go into your own savings is kinda individualistic for something that would benefit both of you. What do you need the maid for? To pick up here and there or to deep clean your home frequently? Also is your home fairly large? If we\u2019re talking about a 800sqft apartment or a 1200sfq home, hiring a maid may be overkill. \n\nNTA, husband sounds kinda rude. Of course that depends on what duties the maid would be fulfilling.", "Op, you need to have a conversation with your husband about expectations about chores around the house. With you not working right now, he might be expecting or depending on you to pick up the slack. You are both adults and have responsibilities. Morr than likely, he assumes that if he is supporting you financially, then for now, your job is the house. \nBut when you start working again, I suggest revisiting the need for a maid. \nThe fact that you haven't mentioned what chores you do or what you fill your day with leaves me with some reservations.\nTalk with your spouse about the division of labor around the house. Write down every chore, and I mean every chore. Grocery shopping\u00d7 frequency, dropping off picking up dry cleaning, dusting, vacuuming, and laundry, to name a few and list who does what. Sometimes, people forget what goes into maintaining a household.

Mostly, this allows you to clear the air about assumptions.", "If you are both responsible for the mess: it should be mutual money that pays for your housekeeping services.
