You don\u2019t really say what your relationship with you ex is like, but if she\u2019s accusing you of putting down her (abandoned) dog to spite her, it\u2019s hard to imagine it\u2019s good. Even so, people responding that you are the AH do have a point.

The reality is, James became your dog when your EX moved overseas without him. Should you have told her? Probably. Asked? Nope.", "NTA. For 6 years it sounds like James was both of your dogs and she left him with you when she traveled overseas which effectively made him your dog. The fact that she wouldn't have even known how James was if you didn't run into her mom and her mom didn't alert her is indicative that she wasn't that invested in the wellbeing of James after she moved abroad so I don't know what else you could've reasonably done in that situation.", "NTA\n\nWhat did she expect? You made a terribly hard choice, one that greets almost every dog owner. And it was hard as hell.

Obviously not because she called you after she found out.\n\nTo me that makes you the asshole, regardless of whether or not she gets back to you quickly, you should have tried to make contact. \n\nAnd you didn't even let her know what happened after you did it.

You did the loving and right thing. \n\n*But after that, you needed to call her.* She should _not_ have found out because you happened to tell her mom, who then called her. \n\nESH.\n\nWhy the hell are so many people saying she abandoned the dog? Depending on the country, it can be really hard to bring in a dog and the travel and possible quarantine can be incredibly stressful.

She had an opportunity to take an overseas job that she probably thought was advancing her career.  When you had the discussion over her leaving and breaking up, did she literally dump the dog on you with no remorse?  Or, was she heartbroken over it, but the two of you decided that you keeping the dog was the best since she knew you would care for it and that you were \"bros.\"\n\nWithout that information, everyone dumping on your ex may be a bit unfounded.  It is possible she was torn leaving the pooch behind, but was reassured because she new he was in good hands.  We all have to make tough decisions in our lives sometimes, and this one may have weighed heavily on her... only you know how she felt about it.\n\nThe other complication is the state of the dog at the time of the diagnosis.  When the Vet gave you the bad news, was the dog in constant pain, suffering, and basically having no form of quality of life?  Or was it not able to eat, but not in pain or suffering, at least at that moment?  If it was suffering, then you had no choice but to act right away.  If it had been me, I would have called right at that moment and, if she didn't answer, would have left her a message stating you were at the Vet, that the diagnosis was the dog was suffering with only a slim possibility of recovery, and that you were going to do the merciful thing and have the dog put down.  I would have told her that you were going to have this done in an hour, unless you heard back from her before that time.  This would have shown her that you did want to get her involved, but weren't willing to make the dog suffer for hours or days waiting for her to call.\n\nIf the Vet had said the dog was not suffering and would have been OK for a day or two, I might have waited and made repeated calls to her, once again leaving a message like the one above letting her know that you need to hear from her by x number of days, otherwise, you're going to follow the Vet's advice and have the dog's suffering ended.  Then, if she had called, you could have let her know there was a slim possibility that surgery might help, and you wanted to know how she intended to pay for that surgery if that is how she wanted to proceed.\n\nThen, even if you had to put the dog down, after an hour or after a few days, I would have called back one more time after it was done, while with the Vet, and asked the Vet if he could leave his diagnosis in the message, as well, so she would know this was a professional medical opinion, and not you acting out of spite.\n\nOf course, it's easy for me to say this, since I get to sit here and think on it.  At the time, I'm sure you were also shocked and torn of the diagnosis and felt horrible... and did what needed to be done for your \"bro\" so he wouldn't suffer any more than necessary.\n\nSo, yes, you are definitely NTA, just a little sloppy in handling the communication.", "NAH\n\nYou probably should've called to let her know that he'd been put down. She's lashing out in grief and anger, probably because she abandoned James and you did everything you could to take care of him. But I can understand her grief. Losing a dog of twelve years is losing a family member - she's not going to be totally rational.", "NTA - people who abandon pets suck and by default are TA unless overwhelmingly proven otherwise", "NTA. I'm sorry for YOUR loss. Your ex doesn't seem like a good pet owner. Dog tax please.", "NTA- that\u2019s a tough one, you stepped up and took care of the dog when she abandoned it. That shows she didn\u2019t care too much about it. You didn\u2019t want to see it suffer.", "nta. She abandoned her dog. So, it became you're dog. you did nothing wrong. she the a-hole here for abandoning her dog on you and not taking her stuff immediately or soon after.", "INFO\n\nHow long between putting the dog down and seeing your ex's mom?\n\nYTA if it was literally days and you didn't even bother to contact your ex.", "NTA she abandoned that dog and you stepped up. You took care of him the best you could until he became too sick. If you had tried to reach out to your ex about the dog's surgery, he could have been left suffering for weeks, possibly for no reason. You did the best you could.", "She abandoned the dog. It would be one thing if she couldn\u2019t take James but still kept in frequent contact to make sure he was taken care of. People do that all the time. She did not do that. She was not paying for any of his maintenance or vet bills. She did not even text to ask for a picture. She gave up ownership of the dog when she abandoned him. If you drop your dog off for boarding and then stop contacting/paying the facility, your dog is considered abandoned and you no longer have any rights over the animal. If you ask your friend to watch your dog and then stop contacting them, that\u2019s abandonment.

She found out from her mom because she didn't bother to listen to it for a week.", "I left her a voicemail.", "OP stated the the ex takes days and weeks to get back to him.  What if that dog was suffering horribly?  What if every waking moment in that dog's life was sheer agony?  Could you sit there and watch a dog that you loved and cared for suffer while you waited for someone who may not return your call for weeks to call back, even if you left a, \"this is an emergency, the dog is in great pain\" message?\n\nI sure as heck couldn't.\n\nAs I said in my post, if the dog was suffering greatly, OP needed to make a decision quickly, with little time to think.  I might have called before having the dog put down and left a message stating I would wait one hour for a call and then was having the dog put out of its suffering, but that would be the extent of it.\n\nIt's sad, yes... but when a person goes MIA for days and weeks at a time and you are forced to make a decision based on quality of life, sometimes you don't have the benefit of waiting around.", "So, when someone abandons a animal to you. They're not giving up their rights over this animal? She clearly didn't care to bring this dog with her.", "About a week. She still hadn't bothered listening to the voicemail I left her about the situation. That is why she found out from her mom.", "Yes I see that but why hasn't she moved James out of your house when you broke up?", "NTA! There was no context before", "Then NTA.", "NTA then - you did what you needed to for what was now your dog. So long as you let her know somehow, youre good. And im also sorry for your loss, this is never easy.", "I dont think we know this was the case - this may have been a decision they reached together.", "It can be very difficult to bring a dog into another country, and very hard on the animal. Leaving it with the BF may well have been the most loving thing.", "I think he should have called to let her know the situation, but I don't think she needs to have a say in the decision. He's the one that has to deal with the choice.", "\"Maybe I could have contacted her to pay for the surgery but **she takes days/weeks to get back to me**.\"\n\nBloat (a twisted stomach) isn't a condition you can wait days or weeks until you deal with it. Bloat can also make the spleen twist and lose circulation, and block vital veins in the back that transport blood to the heart. Bloat is immensely painful for dogs and it can kill in a matter of hours without veterinary intervention.\n\nJames was fortunate that the OP recognized there was something wrong and took immediate action.\n\nAs tragic as losing James was for you, you took the right actions and ultimately made the kindest and hardest decision to help him over The Rainbow Bridge. My sympathies to you.\n\nNTA, OP lost his dog and a large part of his heart. His former girlfriend was totally out of line.\n\nEdited for lack of proofreading skills.", "NTA for putting him down. Probably YTA for not contacting her to just let her know. Whether she sees the message before it happens, or responds is up to her. But it's probably something you could have spent a few minutes to write to her about.\n\nOf course, if she had broken up with you in a horrible fashion, or just abandoned her dog, then eff her, but it doesn't sound like that's the case.", "Would it have killed you to let her know it was happening???   YTA for that.", "I'm gonna say YTA. \n\nYou probably made the best decision for James, and consulting with her probably wouldn't have changed that. However, it was her dog for 12 years, and she's only 4 months removed from him. I feel like you should have at least tried to get in touch to let her know what's going on. Hearing about it from an \"oh by the way\" phone call from her mom is kinda lousy. I don't think you did this out of spite but the right thing to do would be to at least give her a heads up", "YTA - you didn\u2019t just not consult her but you didn\u2019t even tell her.

When she left she basically abandoned this dog and it became yours.  It seems that you made the only decision you could.  Should you have let her know about this?  Perhaps, but James was now your dog.  She left his behind.", "This is probably the worst possible way to phrase the title. NTA after reading the story.", "NTA   You made a choice based on your loyalty to James not out of anger towards his previous person.", "I'm really sorry for your loss.\n\nNo moral judgement, but you absolutely should have told her. Even if just over text, that she's then free to ignore. I was once in a similar situation and my ex came to the vets with me to put her down; it was awkward but I'm glad we were both there to say our individual goodbyes. \n\nObviously, with her out of the country, she couldn't have come and you were in charge of all medical decisions for your dog. But you still should have texted her with the vet's advice & your decision, to cover your own back if nothing else.\n\nThe way she found out was pretty shitty, it should have been from you directly (or even through her mum, but deliberately so, rather than from a random meeting in the street).", "NTA\n\nWhen she left, James became your dog.

Surgery is expensive and is not a guarantee. You did the humane thing and gave the dog a peaceful passing.  My condolences.\n\nYou Ex is psised because she didn't know and her mother informed her not you.  She accuses you that you did it out of spite, I assume she is dealing with her own grief.  to her, this would seem sudden and unexpected.\n\nIf you still have the the bills, maybe you can show her what the vet said?  \n\nYou never asked her to pay for James. She left him with you, and didnt pay any bills going forward after she left.  For all intents and purposes, he was your dog.", "NTA I'm so sorry for your loss and that you had to make this very hard decision. A twisted stomach is very acute and need fast decision, and even young and healthy dogs often have bad prognosis for survival. It's not only the surgery that is risky, complication after the surgery can be fatal. You took the right decision for both you and the dog, euthanasia is never wrong for a sick or old animal.", "NTA - The gall of this lady, you leave her a voicemail after it happened, which she obviously didn't care enough to answer or listen to, and instead got her news from her mother.\n\nYou did the right thing bud, block her, never let her presence darken your mind ever again. After 6 years too, god damn what a woman.", "NTA \n\nForget the sentimental factor for a minute. These surgeries can cost thousands of dollars.

It can be incredibly traumatic for the pet, especially if a long quarantine is necessary. \n\nShe loved her dog and left it with someone who also loved it.

I can't believe you cannot see the difference. \n\nI agree the dog was very lucky to have OP and I agree he made the right decision to put it to sleep.", "I agree OP is NTA. He did good by James. I'm just asking why James was left with him in the first place.", "He did. She didn\u2019t bother to listen to the voicemail he left her. She went a week without listening to it.", "He did. She didn\u2019t bother to listen to the voicemail he left her. She went a week without listening to it.", "Her parents wouldn't take him. He was a big clumsy mutt.", "It's not fair to the dog (especially an older one) to move him out of his safe, familiar home to go to a new environment. The dog was happy there, OP was happy with the dog, why mess that up?", "Then by all means he was your dog. You did good for James. Because of you, he's in a better place without pain or suffering. Sorry for the loss. \n\nI stand by that your EX is an AH.", "I agree", "Nta, you did what's best for the dog. It was 12 years old, that's like 100 in dog years.", "Nta.  You did the right thing for the dog.  Keep that girl as an ex.  The dog became YOUR dog when she left him with you.  It was YOUR choice.  Sorry for your loss.", "Nta. Vet tech here. GDV or bloat or stomach torsion whatever you want to call it  is insanely painful and a risky procedure especially for an older pet. \nIm so sorry that its being spun this way. You did a kind thing for James and he was lucky to have been loved by you.", "NTA. A twisted stomach (I'm assuming this was bloat/GDV) is an incredibly painful, immediately life-threatening emergency, and there's no guarantee that the dog will be able to recover.. Even if you'd tried to get in touch with your ex, it's unlikely that you would have been able to do so in time, especially if she was overseas. You did the kindest thing for a dog you loved. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "I just recently learned that this is a problem with bigger dogs! Nta", "NTA, I think you did the best you could.  Maybe it would help to have the vet set the record straight about what happened.", "NTA. Twisted stomachs are horrific. You made the call that was right for James. I understand why your ex is upset; that\u2019s a heavy thing to find out like that. Even if she did abandon him, it probably would have been worth a phone call afterwards. But you did nothing wrong by making that decision", "NTA, but you should have at least attempted to contact her to let her know what was happening. You didn't have to wait for her to answer, just a courtesy.", "Nta, but maybe should have told her when it happened", "NTA\n\nI took my cat to the vet because she was limping and turns out we had 5 minutes to make the decision to put her down due to how bad the pain of blood clots were. My bf was devastated and in hindsight and wished we went through with the 8k surgery (after already spending 20k) but they said there was such little guarantee of her survival and the operation was complicated and would cause a lot of blood loss. Apparently when one blood clot develops, high chance others will too.\n\nI still think we made the right decision and you did too.", "You were really in a no-win situation here.  NTAH.", "NTA\n\nYou did what was right for the dog.\nJames was lucky to have you.", "ESH, you should have at least told her what happened, wtf?", "Bruh. Come on. You didn\u2019t even send her an email after the fact? That\u2019s cold. You\u2019re not an AH for doing the best thing for James, but not even mentioning it feels really cold and petty.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you lost your buddy James", "INFO:\n\nwhen she left him, did she discuss with you about care or if she would try to take him over?\n\nWas it his age that stopped her being able to take him with her?\n\n\n\n******** Why I ask:\n\nI ask because I, too, had to leave my pets with a friend while I moved overseas.  My first apartment wouldn't allow pets \n\nHousing in Europe is hard to find sometimes and takes time.  Alot of time. Really. \nIt was several months before I could get my other pet flown to me.\n\nThe other pet was elderly and not healthy.  It was advised by his vet that he was not healthy enough to travel on flights that long.  I elected to put him to sleep on a visit back once he started getting more ill.\n\nIf she thought or discussed still wanting to know or be part of her pets life.....you probably should have told her/notified her.  Also if he was that old and has GDV then yes recovery is very difficult on their organs and heart.  So euthanasia is not a bad option but I can understand she might have felt she wanted to know.\n\nFYI:  All those saying she abandoned her pet....it doesn't sound like it to me.  Some pets can't handle long distance flights and the stress on their cardiovascular system when old.\n\nIt sounds like she asked her ex to care for the dog when the dog was too old to travel.  That is a good owner.  So is the ex for agreeing. \n\nEither way:\nIf she gave him to you for the duration of the dogs life but no discussion of care was made:  NTA.\n\nif she gave you the pet/asked to watch him till he can travel or asked you to care for him but still be part of his care ....yeah I'm sorry but YTA if you didn't tell her about it \n\nYou should also, regardless of the above, ask the vet you saw to contact her and tell her about the diagnosis.  If that was GDV in an older dog....yes the right choice really was made.", "NTA", "Yeah, it\u2019s very odd that she leapt to that the conclusion. People usually end up outliving their dogs.", "The OP did the right thing to have the dog put down; torsion is incredibly painful and the poor animal would've suffered greatly. The OP showed his love for the animal despite the emotional pain he endured. NTA, OP, and thank you for caring for the dog with so much respect and love. I know the dog would thank you as well.", "NTA. You clearly loved that dog and had to make a tough decision. If your GF didn't want you to have James then she should've given him to her mom.", "This. She LEFT the dog behind. End of story. That removes any rights she might have had to the dog or to make decisions about the dog.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I'm sorry for *your* loss, too.", "He tried to call but had to leave a voicemail. OP says she won't bother to take his calls or won't respond to any kind of contact for weeks. She ended up not listening to the voicemail until a week later.", "Part of me wonders if her mom twisted the story.", "Where does he say that? Not in the post.", "It doesn't say he left a voicemail in the post?", "Thank you so much \ud83d\ude4f", "Speaking for myself, my husband and I chose not to buy pet insurance because we have enough money to self-insure. In this case, it obviously would've paid off to have it, but overall insurance companies make huge profits because most people pay more over the years than they will collect. For human health care, where one might spend hundreds of thousands of dollars with an unlucky diagnosis, it makes sense to have health insurance anyway, but with pets my husband and I would not spend more than we could comfortably afford.", "That's not how I read his initial post. It sounded like he just didn't bother because she never returns calls or messages promptly. He also said he believes she heard the news from her mother since he got the call after he talked to her mother. \n\nSo unless he clarified in another comment, it seems like he never tried to speak to her before or even after the vet visit", "Yeah, I didn't know that he left her a voicemail after he did it. He didn't put that in the original post.\n\nThere is just no way I wouldn't of texted or called at least a bunch of times in the span of 24 hours before making that decision, I understand you can't leave a dog in pain for over 24 hours, but he should have tried harder to call her before. \n\nHe never said he got in contact with her before hand to tell her what was going on, only that she never texts him back for weeks.", "OP responded to a similar comment.", "Wow, a personal attack all because of my opinion. I am not young, have lived overseas (including during COVID, if you really want to talk about quarantine), and still managed to keep my pets. \n\nLeaving your dog with your ex while you go live your best life is abandonment. Don\u2019t get a dog if you\u2019re not ready for the responsibility, including end of life care. There is no difference to me and many others. The dog just got lucky that he had someone there for him. You have such a trivial perspective on an animal\u2019s life and the responsibility that comes with ownership of one.", "When you abandon an animal\u2026 you\u2019ve abandoned that animal. If you don\u2019t like the word abandoned for some reason, okay, she gave up the dog and gave it to someone else. That\u2019s when it stopped being her problem.", "It was in multiple info comments.", "OPs really need to put that stuff into the actual post.", "That information was not in the original post so I could not possibly have known that.", "You're 24 - at least that's what you've said in another comment and I assume you're truthful. That's young. And what I wrote was not at all a personal attack.", "NTA. At this stage it was your dog, and you loved him and did what's best for him. If the dog was important to her she would have been checking up on him at least weekly", "Not TA for doing what the dog needed, but YTA for not even telling her after the fact.", "OP, I realize that you were the main caretaker of James and that you were no longer in a relationship with your ex. But James was her dog first and you really should have at least messaged her to let her know what was going on. For that reason, YTA.", "YTA. You have no excuse for not having contacted your ex to notify her of her dog's illness that might have led to prolonged suffering. If you could have contacted her to pay for the surgery, you could also have contacted her to notify her of  her dog's poor health and let her be a part of the decision to end her pet's life.\n\nI wonder at the vet allowing you to make a life or death decision for a pet that wasn't your own.\n\nYou behaved badly. You didn't do all you could to keep your ex in the picture where her dog's welfare was concerned. Being out of the US is no excuse. Virtually all the world is connected electronically these days.", "Not even gonna blame the onions...just owning that this brought me to tears. Many many tears.  OP I'm so sorry and wish I could hug you, this must have hurt so much.  I'm glad James was loved by you and I'm sure he was glad too.\n\nNTA", "First, I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. We never have enough time with our furry friends.\n\nSecond, all that mattered in that moment was what was best for James. And that\u2019s what you did. Even though it broke your heart.\n\nNTA.", "NTA just block her and be done", "If he was old, he likely wouldn\u2019t have survived the surgery. NTA but it would have been nice to tell her.", "NTA, you loved the dog (probably even more than her), he was old and in pain.  You did well, hugs to you for the loss of your dog", "Isn\u2019t it amazing how he was everyone\u2019s dog, but only you took care of him? How many times did they visit him?  You did right, ignore them.", "NTA. She just up and left her dog??? \n\nIf she was that concerned she should have made other arrangements for him but you were his carer and made the best decision for him", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss, it's only right to want the best for your pet- and he was YOUR pet by that point. He is no longer suffering.", "NTA. This is a very serious condition and unfortunately it is very painful and can be very difficult for elder dogs to come back from even with surgery. I don\u2019t blame you for opting the make the best choice for your dog. \n\nI understand that James used to be your ex\u2019s dog but she did end up leaving him with you, and unless she stated plans to bring him over\u2026he is otherwise your dog. I think you did your due diligence by trying to leave a voicemail for her, and that\u2019s not on you for her not answering your correspondence. Gdv isn\u2019t something you could wait on especially if she takes days and up to weeks to respond. I recently lost one of my dogs and it nearly broke me. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and it sounds like you were great to James.", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019m sorry about James. The way you write about him, it\u2019s clear you loved him.\n\nMy FIL was a Vet and often did his best to talk people out of expensive, painful procedures with poor potential outcomes, and emphasized allowing beloved pets to die in comfort. Sometimes people would insist, out of love and a refusal to accept the end was nigh. And final days would be not good. \n\nYou made a loving choice for James. \n\n Please put your a-hole ex out of your mind, block her and enjoy your life.", "NTA, sounds like James was your dog at the end. You did the right thing.", "NTA.  She chose to leave the dog behind with you.  You took great care of him, and made a necessary decision based on his health.  She\u2019s just being petty, trying to make you feel bad.  Even her mom understood why you did what you did.", "In a word, YES.....(you are the Ahole)..shame on you", "NTA but do edit the post to show you left a voicemail, because until then I was like \u2018well let her know\u2026\u2019\n\nYou loved James and did your best for him and cried for him, he had a long happy life with you. My brother\u2019s little dog just got hit by a train, and she was only two: I so wish she\u2019d got to live the life James did. \n\nAnd don\u2019t worry about the sucky breakup. She was an ass for assuming such a terrible thing about you, and you have a really good heart. A better individual will be along to snap you up in no time.", "NTA", "You are NTA. You did what was best for Jimbo. Thank you.", "NTA. \n\n>I did everything I could to keep him happy after she left. I didn't do this to hurt her. I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do for James.\r  \n\r\n\nI believe you. I'm sorry about James.", "I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nAnd nta.", "Sooooo.....\n\n Both the asshole and not the asshole....\n\nNot the asshole for putting the dog down, it sucks but it's apart of life.\n\nYou are the asshole because you didn't at least tell her. I am sure she has a lot of emotions she found out her dog died through the grape vine instead of from the person who was responsible for the dogs care. In the modern age there are so many ways to communicate abroad, you could have at least have made an attempt to let her know.", "NTA. Although you should have called or texted her at the time as a courtesy, leaving the dog in excruciating pain while she fails to respond wasn't an option. I can understand why she's upset but you did what was best for James.", "NTA.  I'm sorry for your loss (of the dog, not the gf).", "I don\u2019t think OP is the AH for putting the dog to sleep, but OP might be the AH for not contacting the ex with the news. It sounds like this was an amicable breakup necessitated by her relocation. I imagine leaving James behind was best for him considering his age. OP, have you been maintaining contact with ex prior to this? Was there ever a plan for her to return?", "He did, he said in another comment he left her a voicemail", "Some vets won't do it in older dogs due to the risk of the dog simply not waking up from the strain of the surgery or recovering from the surgery itself", "He contacted her after to let her know what happen, via voicemail. OP mentioned it in another comment. \n\nAnd a twisted stomach is a complication that can kill in as little as a few hours. \n\nShe takes weeks to respond. Whether it was amicable or not, they\u2019ve been broken up for 4 months and hasn\u2019t been checking in on the dog much or at all from the sound of it. That\u2019s more than enough time to say he\u2019s no longer her dog. \n\nIf she really wanted the dog she would have taken him, or mentioned plans to fly him over when she\u2019s settled in. He was healthy enough for the shock of his death to hurt everyone who loved him. \n\nYou\u2019re being amicable to both parties, but I don\u2019t think this was poor communication on his end or that complicated.", "He did, he said in another comment that he left her a voicemail", "He did call, and left a voicemail about what happened. He mentioned it in another comment.", "You don\u2019t have 24 hours with a twisted stomach. You\u2019re lucky to have two hours before deciding on surgery or euthanasia.", "And isn\u2019t that the kind of injury/ailment that once it\u2019s happened once, it\u2019s very likely to re-occur? So even if the surgery was a success, it would have just been a matter of time before it happened again, causing poor James even more pain and distress.", "All good questions- OP does note that she often takes days to weeks to respond to him and this does not sound like a \u201cwait and see\u201d choice.", "Leaving the dog behind might have been what was in his best interest given his age, not necessarily an abandonment", "Then you did everything you needed to do.", "To be fair and this is just in my personal experience. It actually depends on if they even cover it. I have a Great Dane and ended up not getting pet insurance just as so many don\u2019t cover gastric torsion/bloat (barrel chested breeds are more predisposed to it). Sometimes it is better to set aside money for an emergency than pay for an insurance that won\u2019t cover it anyways. Bloat is also a condition that can be very difficult for elder dogs to come back from even with surgery.", "I'm really getting from the comments that the dog was a large/giant breed mutt. 12 years is a miracle for huge dogs, and a flipped stomach is something that looms over every giant breed owner that hasn't shelled out the money for a gastropexy when they were young enough to handle it. There's no way she thought that a large 12+ year old dog would be waiting for her whenever she decided to return.", "Then OP had not choice in the mater.  He could never have contacted  his Ex.", "As a vet nurse, it's definitely something that needs a quick decision. I agree he should have let her know what happened though, rather than her finding out only because her mum randomly bumped into him.", "Oh, I don't think he needed to wait for her to approve the dog being put down, but putting her dog down for a medical necessity, then not sending ANY message, and then mentioning it to her mom because SHE asked about the dog?\n\nNo wonder the ex is pissed, that's a dick move.", "I don't think OP would be expected to wait weeks to make a decision, but they should have made the attempt to communicate what happened. Taking days/weeks is no excuse to not reach out at all...", "You're not wrong, and as we aren't given a timeline from what the dog was PTS and the ex being told by her mom\n\nThe fact that the mum had to tell the ex instead of checking in on her pet that she left is telling\n\nI'd be checking in and asking for pics regularly", "But it is not op dog. Are you crazy \ud83e\udd23?", "He mentions in a few comments that he called and left a voicemail. And she didn\u2019t listen to it until a week later when her mother told her what happened. \n\nAlso, she left the dog for 4 months to go to another country without checking on him. It doesn\u2019t matter how long she had him. James was OP\u2019s dog the moment she left. \n\nOn top of that the dogs condition is extremely painful, and could kill him in hours. How\u2019s he supposed to contact someone who doesn\u2019t respond for weeks?", "Yeah see that\u2019s the thing\u2026If I couldn\u2019t take my cat with me I\u2019d be driving his new person insane just wanting to know how he\u2019s doing. Like, I don\u2019t even know what the circumstances would have to be for leaving him behind would be; I\u2019d be heartbroken.", "I am not 24. Where did I say that, exactly? I don\u2019t see any comment that says that. That\u2019s pretty creepy to go through my comments just to try and assert your point that what\u2026 I\u2019m not emotionally intelligent enough because of the age you think I am? \n\nIt most certainly is a personal attack. At minimum, it\u2019s condescending and you can do better than that at your ripe age. I\u2019m not old enough to have a 21 year old, that\u2019s for sure. Congrats."]}
