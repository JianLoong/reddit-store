You don\u2019t really say what your relationship with you ex is like, but if she\u2019s accusing you of putting down her (abandoned) dog to spite her, it\u2019s hard to imagine it\u2019s good. Even so, people responding that you are the AH do have a point. Unless you just weren\u2019t on speaking terms you really should have at least let her know what was going on out of courtesy rather than let her find out second hand.", "NTA. The reality is, James became your dog when your EX moved overseas without him. Should you have told her? Probably. Asked? Nope.", "NTA. For 6 years it sounds like James was both of your dogs and she left him with you when she traveled overseas which effectively made him your dog. The fact that she wouldn't have even known how James was if you didn't run into her mom and her mom didn't alert her is indicative that she wasn't that invested in the wellbeing of James after she moved abroad so I don't know what else you could've reasonably done in that situation.", "NTA\n\nWhat did she expect? You made a terribly hard choice, one that greets almost every dog owner. And it was hard as hell.

Obviously not because she called you after she found out.\n\nTo me that makes you the asshole, regardless of whether or not she gets back to you quickly, you should have tried to make contact. \n\nAnd you didn't even let her know what happened after you did it.

You did the loving and right thing. \n\n*But after that, you needed to call her.* She should _not_ have found out because you happened to tell her mom, who then called her. \n\nESH.\n\nWhy the hell are so many people saying she abandoned the dog? Depending on the country, it can be really hard to bring in a dog and the travel and possible quarantine can be incredibly stressful.

She had an opportunity to take an overseas job that she probably thought was advancing her career.  When you had the discussion over her leaving and breaking up, did she literally dump the dog on you with no remorse?  Or, was she heartbroken over it, but the two of you decided that you keeping the dog was the best since she knew you would care for it and that you were \"bros.\"\n\nWithout that information, everyone dumping on your ex may be a bit unfounded.  It is possible she was torn leaving the pooch behind, but was reassured because she new he was in good hands.  We all have to make tough decisions in our lives sometimes, and this one may have weighed heavily on her... only you know how she felt about it.\n\nThe other complication is the state of the dog at the time of the diagnosis.  When the Vet gave you the bad news, was the dog in constant pain, suffering, and basically having no form of quality of life?  Or was it not able to eat, but not in pain or suffering, at least at that moment?  If it was suffering, then you had no choice but to act right away.  If it had been me, I would have called right at that moment and, if she didn't answer, would have left her a message stating you were at the Vet, that the diagnosis was the dog was suffering with only a slim possibility of recovery, and that you were going to do the merciful thing and have the dog put down.  I would have told her that you were going to have this done in an hour, unless you heard back from her before that time.  This would have shown her that you did want to get her involved, but weren't willing to make the dog suffer for hours or days waiting for her to call.\n\nIf the Vet had said the dog was not suffering and would have been OK for a day or two, I might have waited and made repeated calls to her, once again leaving a message like the one above letting her know that you need to hear from her by x number of days, otherwise, you're going to follow the Vet's advice and have the dog's suffering ended.  Then, if she had called, you could have let her know there was a slim possibility that surgery might help, and you wanted to know how she intended to pay for that surgery if that is how she wanted to proceed.\n\nThen, even if you had to put the dog down, after an hour or after a few days, I would have called back one more time after it was done, while with the Vet, and asked the Vet if he could leave his diagnosis in the message, as well, so she would know this was a professional medical opinion, and not you acting out of spite.\n\nOf course, it's easy for me to say this, since I get to sit here and think on it.  At the time, I'm sure you were also shocked and torn of the diagnosis and felt horrible... and did what needed to be done for your \"bro\" so he wouldn't suffer any more than necessary.\n\nSo, yes, you are definitely NTA, just a little sloppy in handling the communication.", "NAH\n\nYou probably should've called to let her know that he'd been put down. She's lashing out in grief and anger, probably because she abandoned James and you did everything you could to take care of him. But I can understand her grief. Losing a dog of twelve years is losing a family member - she's not going to be totally rational.", "NTA - people who abandon pets suck and by default are TA unless overwhelmingly proven otherwise", "NTA. I'm sorry for YOUR loss. Your ex doesn't seem like a good pet owner. Dog tax please.", "NTA- that\u2019s a tough one, you stepped up and took care of the dog when she abandoned it. That shows she didn\u2019t care too much about it. You didn\u2019t want to see it suffer.", "nta. She abandoned her dog. So, it became you're dog. you did nothing wrong. she the a-hole here for abandoning her dog on you and not taking her stuff immediately or soon after.", "INFO\n\nHow long between putting the dog down and seeing your ex's mom?\n\nYTA if it was literally days and you didn't even bother to contact your ex.", "NTA she abandoned that dog and you stepped up. You took care of him the best you could until he became too sick. If you had tried to reach out to your ex about the dog's surgery, he could have been left suffering for weeks, possibly for no reason. You did the best you could.", "She abandoned the dog. It would be one thing if she couldn\u2019t take James but still kept in frequent contact to make sure he was taken care of. People do that all the time. She did not do that. She was not paying for any of his maintenance or vet bills. She did not even text to ask for a picture. She gave up ownership of the dog when she abandoned him. If you drop your dog off for boarding and then stop contacting/paying the facility, your dog is considered abandoned and you no longer have any rights over the animal. If you ask your friend to watch your dog and then stop contacting them, that\u2019s abandonment.

She found out from her mom because she didn't bother to listen to it for a week.", "I left her a voicemail.", "OP stated the the ex takes days and weeks to get back to him.  What if that dog was suffering horribly?  What if every waking moment in that dog's life was sheer agony?  Could you sit there and watch a dog that you loved and cared for suffer while you waited for someone who may not return your call for weeks to call back, even if you left a, \"this is an emergency, the dog is in great pain\" message?\n\nI sure as heck couldn't.\n\nAs I said in my post, if the dog was suffering greatly, OP needed to make a decision quickly, with little time to think.  I might have called before having the dog put down and left a message stating I would wait one hour for a call and then was having the dog put out of its suffering, but that would be the extent of it.\n\nIt's sad, yes... but when a person goes MIA for days and weeks at a time and you are forced to make a decision based on quality of life, sometimes you don't have the benefit of waiting around.", "So, when someone abandons a animal to you. They're not giving up their rights over this animal? She clearly didn't care to bring this dog with her.", "About a week. She still hadn't bothered listening to the voicemail I left her about the situation. That is why she found out from her mom.", "Yes I see that but why hasn't she moved James out of your house when you broke up?", "NTA! There was no context before", "Then NTA.", "NTA then - you did what you needed to for what was now your dog. So long as you let her know somehow, youre good. And im also sorry for your loss, this is never easy.", "I dont think we know this was the case - this may have been a decision they reached together.", "It can be very difficult to bring a dog into another country, and very hard on the animal. Leaving it with the BF may well have been the most loving thing.", "I think he should have called to let her know the situation, but I don't think she needs to have a say in the decision. He's the one that has to deal with the choice.", "\"Maybe I could have contacted her to pay for the surgery but **she takes days/weeks to get back to me**.\"\n\nBloat (a twisted stomach) isn't a condition you can wait days or weeks until you deal with it. Bloat can also make the spleen twist and lose circulation, and block vital veins in the back that transport blood to the heart. Bloat is immensely painful for dogs and it can kill in a matter of hours without veterinary intervention.\n\nJames was fortunate that the OP recognized there was something wrong and took immediate action.\n\nAs tragic as losing James was for you, you took the right actions and ultimately made the kindest and hardest decision to help him over The Rainbow Bridge. My sympathies to you.\n\nNTA, OP lost his dog and a large part of his heart. His former girlfriend was totally out of line.\n\nEdited for lack of proofreading skills.", "NTA for putting him down. Probably YTA for not contacting her to just let her know. Whether she sees the message before it happens, or responds is up to her. But it's probably something you could have spent a few minutes to write to her about.\n\nOf course, if she had broken up with you in a horrible fashion, or just abandoned her dog, then eff her, but it doesn't sound like that's the case.", "Would it have killed you to let her know it was happening???   YTA for that.", "I'm gonna say YTA. \n\nYou probably made the best decision for James, and consulting with her probably wouldn't have changed that. However, it was her dog for 12 years, and she's only 4 months removed from him. I feel like you should have at least tried to get in touch to let her know what's going on. Hearing about it from an \"oh by the way\" phone call from her mom is kinda lousy. I don't think you did this out of spite but the right thing to do would be to at least give her a heads up", "YTA - you didn\u2019t just not consult her but you didn\u2019t even tell her.

When she left she basically abandoned this dog and it became yours.  It seems that you made the only decision you could.  Should you have let her know about this?  Perhaps, but James was now your dog.  She left his behind.", "This is probably the worst possible way to phrase the title. NTA after reading the story.", "NTA   You made a choice based on your loyalty to James not out of anger towards his previous person.", "I'm really sorry for your loss.\n\nNo moral judgement, but you absolutely should have told her. Even if just over text, that she's then free to ignore. I was once in a similar situation and my ex came to the vets with me to put her down; it was awkward but I'm glad we were both there to say our individual goodbyes. \n\nObviously, with her out of the country, she couldn't have come and you were in charge of all medical decisions for your dog. But you still should have texted her with the vet's advice & your decision, to cover your own back if nothing else.\n\nThe way she found out was pretty shitty, it should have been from you directly (or even through her mum, but deliberately so, rather than from a random meeting in the street).", "NTA\n\nWhen she left, James became your dog.

Surgery is expensive and is not a guarantee. You did the humane thing and gave the dog a peaceful passing.  My condolences.\n\nYou Ex is psised because she didn't know and her mother informed her not you.  She accuses you that you did it out of spite, I assume she is dealing with her own grief.  to her, this would seem sudden and unexpected.\n\nIf you still have the the bills, maybe you can show her what the vet said?  \n\nYou never asked her to pay for James. She left him with you, and didnt pay any bills going forward after she left.  For all intents and purposes, he was your dog.", "NTA I'm so sorry for your loss and that you had to make this very hard decision. A twisted stomach is very acute and need fast decision, and even young and healthy dogs often have bad prognosis for survival. It's not only the surgery that is risky, complication after the surgery can be fatal. You took the right decision for both you and the dog, euthanasia is never wrong for a sick or old animal.", "NTA - The gall of this lady, you leave her a voicemail after it happened, which she obviously didn't care enough to answer or listen to, and instead got her news from her mother.\n\nYou did the right thing bud, block her, never let her presence darken your mind ever again. After 6 years too, god damn what a woman.", "NTA \n\nForget the sentimental factor for a minute. These surgeries can cost thousands of dollars.

I can't believe you cannot see the difference. \n\nI agree the dog was very lucky to have OP and I agree he made the right decision to put it to sleep.", "I agree OP is NTA. He did good by James. I'm just asking why James was left with him in the first place.", "He did. She didn\u2019t bother to listen to the voicemail he left her. She went a week without listening to it.", "He did. She didn\u2019t bother to listen to the voicemail he left her. She went a week without listening to it.", "Her parents wouldn't take him. He was a big clumsy mutt.", "It's not fair to the dog (especially an older one) to move him out of his safe, familiar home to go to a new environment.

Sorry for the loss. \n\nI stand by that your EX is an AH.", "I agree"]}
