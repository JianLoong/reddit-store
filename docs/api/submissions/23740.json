That is one big plot hole. \n\nYou did your best for James and of course you had to put him down because it'll be just suffering for James even if you went ahead with the surgery. That wasn't petty at all. \n\nThe fact she thinks you did it out of spite is an AH thing to say.", "NTA - when she left James with you he became your dog - not hers - if she cared about the dog she would have taken him with her.", "NTA you loved that dog and did the best you could for him. You don\u2019t really say what your relationship with you ex is like, but if she\u2019s accusing you of putting down her (abandoned) dog to spite her, it\u2019s hard to imagine it\u2019s good. Even so, people responding that you are the AH do have a point. Unless you just weren\u2019t on speaking terms you really should have at least let her know what was going on out of courtesy rather than let her find out second hand.", "NTA. The reality is, James became your dog when your EX moved overseas without him. Should you have told her? Probably. Asked? Nope.", "NTA. For 6 years it sounds like James was both of your dogs and she left him with you when she traveled overseas which effectively made him your dog. The fact that she wouldn't have even known how James was if you didn't run into her mom and her mom didn't alert her is indicative that she wasn't that invested in the wellbeing of James after she moved abroad so I don't know what else you could've reasonably done in that situation.", "NTA\n\nWhat did she expect? You made a terribly hard choice, one that greets almost every dog owner. And it was hard as hell. You did what you thought was best for James and grieved his loss. \n\nAt the end of the day he was your dog. Not hers. She gave that up. And you did what was best for him.", "YTA\n\nhe might have gotten back to you quickly if it was about her dog dying though? In saying that, she left him with you which does entail that you are responsible for her, so if something like this comes up you have to deal with it.\n\nDid she ever text or call to check in on James when he still alive?\n\nDid you bother to call or text her after to let her know what happened? Obviously not because she called you after she found out.\n\nTo me that makes you the asshole, regardless of whether or not she gets back to you quickly, you should have tried to make contact. \n\nAnd you didn't even let her know what happened after you did it. You're trying to make out your this good dog guy who cares, while you may have loved James, you were did this on purpose to her I think.", "NTA for trying doing the most merciful thing for James, but YTA a little also for not at least calling her to inform her.", "I too had a dog with a \u2018twisted stomach\u2019, usually occurs in barrel chested dogs. Horrible, horrible death. First time I paid for the surgery. $1500 fifteen years ago. 7 months later it happened again. We had to put him down with limited time before the worst of the worst occurred. NTA. It was mercy and love.", "Edit: NTA!! You did the right thing by James, she deserted him in his golden years and you stuck it out to the end. When I posted this the text wouldn\u2019t load only the title and the first paragraph so with more context definitely NTA\n\nYTA", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou clearly cared for James and wanted the best for him.", "You should have tried to call her, ideally when the vet gave you the options. Clearly her mother was able to get hold of her. \n\nI'm thinking that the dog was in a fair amount of pain and you needed to do something quickly. So I don't fault you for making the decision to euthanize an old, very sick dog in pain without waiting to talk to your ex. You did the loving and right thing. \n\n*But after that, you needed to call her.* She should _not_ have found out because you happened to tell her mom, who then called her. \n\nESH.\n\nWhy the hell are so many people saying she abandoned the dog? Depending on the country, it can be really hard to bring in a dog and the travel and possible quarantine can be incredibly stressful. An elderly dog may not survive it - and I'd hate my beloved pet to die in a quarantine facility. The ex probably did the best thing for the dog by leaving it with OP, who also loved it.", "NTA.\n\nShe left James with you. She abandoned James. He was no longer *her* dog, James became *YOUR* dog.  Your cared for him. A twisted stomach is a nasty thing for a dog to have, and it's extremely difficult and painful for a senior dog to endure, *if* they even survive surgery. Price or not, you made the correct choice. You chose a humane, peaceful end, you did not let him suffer. He was your pet, not hers. Let her be a petty AH. She wasn't there to make the hard choices. You were.", "Info: why didn't you try to call your ex to see if she wanted to pay for surgery vs euthanasia, or at least alert her to the situation\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. My dog just died from volvulus (twisted stomach) yesterday despite our paying $10K for emergency surgery", "NTA\n\nShe was out of line saying it was to spite her. You did the best you could while the dog was in pain. She abandoned him and obviously wasn't checking in. Just not ok", "Yta. You should have said something to her before. Even if it wasnt her dog anymore, it was for 12 years.", "YTA. You should have at least contacted your ex and told her what was happening.", "NTA , she abandoned the dog and went to live her life , you took care of him and are his owner now ! Your pup your decision", "Info - did you contact her after to let her know?", "NTA - she left you with an elderly dog with no easy way to get in touch with her. The dog would have been suffering in pain until you reached her. You acted in the best interests of the dog. How long was it between your very sad loss of a friend and her Mum asking about him? It doesn't seem like he was top of her mind.", "NTA\n\nThough it would have been nice to send her a voicemail, text, or email of the situation letting her know what had to be done (if it takes forever for her to get back to you that\u2019s on her).\nYou did nothing wrong and you were looking after the well being of YOUR dog.", "NTA - she up and left her dog. Clearly she doesnt care all that much about the poor thing.", "NTA for doing the humane thing and putting the dog down, however...\n\nYTA for not telling her straight away.", "NTA, I do think you should have told her before you was gonna do this but she left james with you so you have the right to put down a poorly dog the right way", "Gonna go with ESH.\n\nEx shouldn\u2019t have abandoned the dog and you should have at least told her before euthanising it.", "I'd say YTA...it's clear that you loved and cared for the dog, but you should have called Ex as soon as you took the dog to the vet and you should have come to a conclusion together...", "NTA\n\nBut this one is close and complicated.\n\nFirst off, we don't know how amicable your split with your ex was at the time.  She had an opportunity to take an overseas job that she probably thought was advancing her career.  When you had the discussion over her leaving and breaking up, did she literally dump the dog on you with no remorse?  Or, was she heartbroken over it, but the two of you decided that you keeping the dog was the best since she knew you would care for it and that you were \"bros.\"\n\nWithout that information, everyone dumping on your ex may be a bit unfounded.  It is possible she was torn leaving the pooch behind, but was reassured because she new he was in good hands.  We all have to make tough decisions in our lives sometimes, and this one may have weighed heavily on her... only you know how she felt about it.\n\nThe other complication is the state of the dog at the time of the diagnosis.  When the Vet gave you the bad news, was the dog in constant pain, suffering, and basically having no form of quality of life?  Or was it not able to eat, but not in pain or suffering, at least at that moment?  If it was suffering, then you had no choice but to act right away.  If it had been me, I would have called right at that moment and, if she didn't answer, would have left her a message stating you were at the Vet, that the diagnosis was the dog was suffering with only a slim possibility of recovery, and that you were going to do the merciful thing and have the dog put down.  I would have told her that you were going to have this done in an hour, unless you heard back from her before that time.  This would have shown her that you did want to get her involved, but weren't willing to make the dog suffer for hours or days waiting for her to call.\n\nIf the Vet had said the dog was not suffering and would have been OK for a day or two, I might have waited and made repeated calls to her, once again leaving a message like the one above letting her know that you need to hear from her by x number of days, otherwise, you're going to follow the Vet's advice and have the dog's suffering ended.  Then, if she had called, you could have let her know there was a slim possibility that surgery might help, and you wanted to know how she intended to pay for that surgery if that is how she wanted to proceed.\n\nThen, even if you had to put the dog down, after an hour or after a few days, I would have called back one more time after it was done, while with the Vet, and asked the Vet if he could leave his diagnosis in the message, as well, so she would know this was a professional medical opinion, and not you acting out of spite.\n\nOf course, it's easy for me to say this, since I get to sit here and think on it.  At the time, I'm sure you were also shocked and torn of the diagnosis and felt horrible... and did what needed to be done for your \"bro\" so he wouldn't suffer any more than necessary.\n\nSo, yes, you are definitely NTA, just a little sloppy in handling the communication.", "NAH\n\nYou probably should've called to let her know that he'd been put down. She's lashing out in grief and anger, probably because she abandoned James and you did everything you could to take care of him. But I can understand her grief. Losing a dog of twelve years is losing a family member - she's not going to be totally rational.", "NTA - people who abandon pets suck and by default are TA unless overwhelmingly proven otherwise", "NTA. I'm sorry for YOUR loss. Your ex doesn't seem like a good pet owner. Dog tax please.", "NTA- that\u2019s a tough one, you stepped up and took care of the dog when she abandoned it. That shows she didn\u2019t care too much about it. You didn\u2019t want to see it suffer.", "nta. She abandoned her dog. So, it became you're dog. you did nothing wrong. she the a-hole here for abandoning her dog on you and not taking her stuff immediately or soon after.", "INFO\n\nHow long between putting the dog down and seeing your ex's mom?\n\nYTA if it was literally days and you didn't even bother to contact your ex.", "NTA she abandoned that dog and you stepped up. You took care of him the best you could until he became too sick. If you had tried to reach out to your ex about the dog's surgery, he could have been left suffering for weeks, possibly for no reason. You did the best you could.", "She abandoned the dog. It would be one thing if she couldn\u2019t take James but still kept in frequent contact to make sure he was taken care of. People do that all the time. She did not do that. She was not paying for any of his maintenance or vet bills. She did not even text to ask for a picture. She gave up ownership of the dog when she abandoned him. If you drop your dog off for boarding and then stop contacting/paying the facility, your dog is considered abandoned and you no longer have any rights over the animal. If you ask your friend to watch your dog and then stop contacting them, that\u2019s abandonment. If you dump your dog on the side of the road you don\u2019t get to be upset at the people who rescue them because they didn\u2019t ask you first. \n\nNTA", "James has lived in my house for five years.", "Dog is no longer her property. She left he paid for everything, she has no case. Obviously she never called to check up on the dog.", "If she cared so much about the dog she wouldn't have left it with the guy she broke up with to leave the country. The dog was sick. NTA, wild you think this was a spite move lmao, regardless of whether or not he told her(which he has said he left a voicemail so)", "Why?", "I left her a voicemail. She found out from her mom because she didn't bother to listen to it for a week.", "I left her a voicemail.", "OP stated the the ex takes days and weeks to get back to him.  What if that dog was suffering horribly?  What if every waking moment in that dog's life was sheer agony?  Could you sit there and watch a dog that you loved and cared for suffer while you waited for someone who may not return your call for weeks to call back, even if you left a, \"this is an emergency, the dog is in great pain\" message?\n\nI sure as heck couldn't.\n\nAs I said in my post, if the dog was suffering greatly, OP needed to make a decision quickly, with little time to think.  I might have called before having the dog put down and left a message stating I would wait one hour for a call and then was having the dog put out of its suffering, but that would be the extent of it.\n\nIt's sad, yes... but when a person goes MIA for days and weeks at a time and you are forced to make a decision based on quality of life, sometimes you don't have the benefit of waiting around.", "So, when someone abandons a animal to you. They're not giving up their rights over this animal? She clearly didn't care to bring this dog with her.", "About a week. She still hadn't bothered listening to the voicemail I left her about the situation. That is why she found out from her mom.", "Yes I see that but why hasn't she moved James out of your house when you broke up?", "NTA! There was no context before", "Then NTA.", "NTA then - you did what you needed to for what was now your dog. So long as you let her know somehow, youre good. And im also sorry for your loss, this is never easy.", "I dont think we know this was the case - this may have been a decision they reached together.", "It can be very difficult to bring a dog into another country, and very hard on the animal. Leaving it with the BF may well have been the most loving thing.", "I think he should have called to let her know the situation, but I don't think she needs to have a say in the decision. He's the one that has to deal with the choice."]}
