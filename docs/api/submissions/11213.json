It's not like she could miss it either, it was black text on a luminous orange sticker \n\nI saw her mouth opening and losing like a fish gasping for air, I walked up to the window with a huge grin, and gave her a wave, before removing said sign and walking away. \n\nHopefully job done and something to look into wrt privacy film.", "Not op but going to check this out.

Thanks!", "Yep, and she's most definitely an asshole.", "You know, in the same place, as it would be considered criminal what she\u2019s doing. Like literally a peeping Tom maybe look into that next?", "Get a really visibly camera-ish camera, and every time you see her, pick it up and aim it at her. Or just set it up with a little sign that says \"recording in progress\" you don't actually have to record or take pics, but give her a little taste of being observed.", "It's socially acceptable to look into people's windows in the country I live in. I put the film on my windows and it eliminates the possibility during the day. I walked around in my underwear all through Covid with complete privacy. Good luck.", "It's called Privacy Window Film. I had a professional company install it in San Francisco. All you need is degreasing soap to get any adhesive residue off the window after removing it. It had a 10-year warranty.

Peeping in peoples windows can get you arrested in some places.", "NTA. But you should look into a glaze for the bottom part of the window. I've done it by mixing glue with a little water and then brushing it on. ITs also easy to remove (its also a good hack for when you are painting the window frames. Paint then peal off the glue).", "NTA and I love it.", "Put reflective mirror tint on the window, so she can watch herself be an ass!", "NTA\u2026.flash her every time she looks in.   Or moon her.  That will stop her.  Hold up a sign\u2026\u201dcan I help you?\u201d  Or This is not a mirror\u201d.  Or any crazy thing you can think of.

Here\u2019s an idea next time she does it and no one else is out there if you have nowhere else to be just walk around in boxers(or if female bra and underwear) if she complains just say \u201csorry if your so interested in my home life thought I\u2019d give you a show\u201d (extra points if you answer the door still in your undergarments)", "NTA get a camera and also the window clings that blur inside of your home", "There is a window film you can put up that is reflective.

If so - Ffs. If not - the fried dumplings rock. And the hazelnut vodka shots!)\n\nAlso, Ashoka restaurants are great for curry.

Or pop up and yell boo at her. Like make her feel weird about doing this.", "Go to Walmart for a dollar in hardware with spray paint you can get a can of window froster.
