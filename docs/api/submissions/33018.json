I mean an 18-year-old is not usually emotionally equipped to deal with a large influx of cash and resources.

Quality time with someone goes a lot further than just throwing gifts and money at someone. Now your girlfriend is a walking red flag and you need to end that nonsense now.

What you did for your daughter has nothing to do with the future you and your girlfriend are looking at, yet your girlfriend is furious with you for something that was done prior to the relationship and worried about her and her daughter being taken care of? Why doesn't she have a house? All I can see in this is a woman looking for a sugar daddy and she thought you were it.

I mean with that you helped your daughter start a business and are by the sounds of it still guiding her financially which I find reasonable despite the extreme circumstances. I however think you should talk to your girlfriend about her reaction. It felt kind of off because she\u2019s asking about her child\u2019s well-being who she\u2019s been financially supporting without your help I\u2019m assuming and your future children that don\u2019t even exist yet, after hearing you gave what you had to your daughter before even meeting her. Which I get it being in your 30\u2019s and hearing someone is essentially starting all over again is terrifying she\u2019s allowed to feel shocked by that and I can see being upset and angry because she feels blind sided. But what\u2019s not ok is acting like money is owed to you. During those 10months she didn\u2019t question your assets or y\u2019all didn\u2019t have that financial talk but are talking marriage? But you also stated you live a well off lifestyle, which sounds like she also has benefited from. Seems like she expected to be a well kept woman without communicating that and is upset that the ideal lifestyle she planned isn\u2019t going to happen. It\u2019s not wrong to fantasize about a life together. But I think it\u2019s a red flag that she is upset about money that isn\u2019t even hers to question since it\u2019s been your daughter\u2019s for a year now. Besides whose to say your time frame of marriage and when especially after 10 months it\u2019s not a year yet still relatively very new. You also mentioned she has been unfaithful before. So you had to restart essentially to also get over that betrayal. I think maybe you two should sit down and lay it all out including how you both see your lives playing out from here on.

Do you have a backup plan if that does happen?  I think you and your GF should've discussed this once things got serious, but I don't blame her in a way for being irate.

I don't think A H is applicable, how about colosal moron.", "I don't entirely get so many people calling you idiotic or moronic. Yes, it's weird if you look at it like you gave an 18 year old too much at once, but that's not how I see it. The way it looks to me, is that you basically said \"I gave you (daughter) up for all of this, and now I want to show you that I both regret that decision and you are worth more than all these things, so I'm giving them up for you now\". \n\nI don't really see deception to your gf here, but I do think it's a bit worrysome she is this bothered by it. She's not with you for your things and your money (I assume), and you've shown you work, have a reliable and steady income, and have goals you are working toward (like buying your own home), so she should really not have this much of an issue with this. Yes, it's weird because it's not the norm, but that doesn't mean you did something bad or stupid.\n\nSo because of her reaction, I'm saying NTA instead of N A H, and because I think it's really telling that your daughter doesn't like her. Maybe it's wise to have a conversation with your daughter about that, see if you can find out why she dislikes your gf so much and see if there is more behavior you might have overlooked or missed.", "NTA, not exactly.  I think it was a very *unwise* move to give your daughter all that.  She needs to learn the value of money, how to save and budget, etc etc - and that's hampered by handing her wealth on a plate.  But it wasn't in any way an *AH* move, and it was spurred by good (if misguided) intentions.\n\nAs for not telling your gf?  Eh, no obligation to do so when you first met, probably reasonable to tell her before thinking about getting married - which you've done.  So I don't think she has any real reason to be upset here.  Honestly, it sounds like she is just bitter because she thought she was marrying into money, and isn't - which isn't such a great look for her.", "NTA. You are giving your daughter a bright future where she doesn't need to worry about having a roof or a car, which is more than most people can say. And you're doing it because you care about her. I don't love that your girlfriend reacted in a, \"what about me\" way when you have already said you make enough to buy these things again.  It sounds a little like jealousy and that she doesn't understand the dynamic with your daughter.  It's worrisome that your daughter doesn't like her, too. Is there a reason she isn't a fan?", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 get rid of the GF.

I\u2019d call you impulsive with your heart in the right place. NTA", "NTA and your girlfriend doesn't seem like a very nice person at all espically as she's already cheated on you once already", "I appreciate the impulse but this is a dumb idea. She doesnt need all your worldly possessions, she needs a parent. The only way to make up for past neglect is to be there for her.", "Nice story bro", "Do you think your daughter has chosen to grow closer to you for the purpose of knowing you will give everything you have to her? Coming from someone who is not close with their father at all. Has it ever occurred to you that you may be being used??", "I understand her wanting to make sure future kids are provided for, but it kinda makes her sound like she\u2019s only with you for her stuff. You need to have a sit down conversation about it all and explain to her your future goals and plans. \n\nAs for your daughter not allowing you to live in the house after you\u2019re married, that\u2019s one thing she has to realize is a potential possibility. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for wanting to provide for your kid, but no ale sure that relationship is being built too and it\u2019s not just the stuff you e given her.", "not ta for wanting to give your daughter a lot but YTA for giving her everything and not telling your gf this. Couple reasons - number one owning a home is a big responsibility. Will she have the mortgage in her name / be taking on payments? Will she be able to deal with maintenance, taxes, etc?\n\nDoes she need a car or is the home in a convenient location? I feel like it would\u2019ve been better to just give her a lot of $$$ for college / her career and help her find a home she wanted. That way you\u2019re doing something together & getting her things that best support her goals. I\u2019d reconsider this a little.\n\nAlso, considering your gf is considering living with you idk why you didn\u2019t give her a heads up.", "You're sending a bad message to her by handing over everything you own because you feel guilty about something YOU did. \n\nWhen these new adults go out into the real world, there are a lot of great lessons and learning experiences from getting a job, working your way up and earning your possessions that way. It's perfectly fine to help out and be supportive, but handing her everything before she's actually experienced adult life is a bad precedence to set.\n\nAs parents, we aren't supposed to just give our kids everything we own. We are supposed to help guide them through life so they can learn to be good people. \n\nWhen it comes to your gf I can't blame her for being upset. She sees your guilt from putting your daughter in a very unfavorable situation years ago and you're kind of disregarding her and her daughter because of that. She wants what's best for her and her daughter and I can understand why the idea of starting over again in terms of finances and a home could be very unfavorable.\n\nI wouldn't call you an A-Hole, OP. But this isn't great parenting.", "You're setting yourself up for heartache.  \n\nWhat your daughter wants most is a loving, supportive parent (likely, you may need to work with her in family counseling to get past the anger and hurt first).\n\nDo give your daughter what you owe her for past child support (not all at once. Make sure she knows how to manage money.)\n\nDo Not stay in a relationship with a woman who does not like your daughter if you want a chance of keeping her in your life. \n\nDo keep enough finances to support yourself.  Your time and love are more important than money.", "Not smart. The best gift to give your kids is being able to take care of yourself when you're older. Be generous but don't be foolish due to guilt", "This post screams bad Netflix script lol", "NTA  Run run as fast as you can find somebody better positioned on the \"hot crazy scale\" and start all over", "So your gf liked you when she thought you had a house and car and money n now she's mad you don't. And you gave your young daughter the responsibility's most adults (yourself included) can't handle.\n             Not the as hole for giving things to your daughter. But you are the as hole for how you went about everything you should have talked to your possibly future wife first. And you should have eased your daughter into it. Like start with the  car then have her go over bills with you so she understands the importance of paying bills then once you felt she could be trusted enough to take over then give her the house etc etc you just did everything wrong.", "NTA- I can understand that you're fealing a bit absent, because of the fact you weren't helping her in her young stages. but I also think that it's a bit extreme to give your daughter everything.\n\n I do think you should have told your girl friend once relationship got serious so she understood that financially all you can bring to the table is a good job and good salary. That being said you need to communicate if the relationship continues - she asked about her kid. You are not responsible for her almost adult child. But you need to think about the fact that maybe you would've kids with her you would need to backup financially same as you were backing up your daughter, and now there are so many questions you need to answer, and my best advice is just to communicate and see where everything goes.\n\n In conclusion I think you didn't behave bad in any case, You just wanted to bring your daughter all the things you weren't been able to give her before.", "This reminds me of how a lot of celebrities turned out, especially those that were in poverty before they made it big, and made it big as young adults.", "I'm so surprised I had to scroll so far for an NTA.  \n\n\nOP was not in his daughter's life for 13 years. Since then they have gotten close and built a relationship. Five years later he was doing quite well financially and decided to set her up in a way many people on reddit could only dream of by giving her a solid investment (property), savings, and a car. Everyone is constantly complaining how they can't afford a house these days, he just gave one to his daughter! He is employed, he makes over six figures, he still has some savings and has been saving the two years since he did all this. Their relationship was already good at the point when he did this. Eccentric, sure? But this isn't exactly out of your mind behavior. They work on the finances together and he teaches her, but most importantly, he and the daughter's relationship isn't what he's asking about!   \n\n\nThe question is if he's an a h for not bringing it up to his gf until now, I say no. You're ten months in, talking about marriage, now is the time to discuss your finances as you're thinking of what your life may look like together.", "His gf already cheated on him as per the comments and he\u2019s talking marriage now.

At that age it's easy to get into toxic relationships... even toxic friendships and be taken advantage of which is part of the reason why they usually recommend a trust until 25+. You way want to have a discussion with her about putting that money away somewhere safe. I know you think your daughter is mature and better than you and im not doubting that but i also know how stupid 19 yr olds can be. At the very least i would have her meet with a financial advisor.", "Nice of you to put that on her", "i like the principle but the execution was horrible.  you should have gotten professional advice.

He IS a giant idiot.", "I think it\u2019s jumping the gun to say the 18 year old is too immature to handle money. It really depends on the individual. At age 18, I had already saved enough to buy a car, had decent savings, and was earning enough through part time jobs and scholarships to live independently. I was also filing my parents taxes, paying my own bills and doing all the paperwork for the family home such as paying property taxes. And I never felt that it was hard, because I\u2019ve been raised to take over those responsibilities gradually. Saying that 18 year olds can\u2019t do it takes away agency from these legal adults, and actually sets the expectation that they don\u2019t need to be responsible for that stuff, when actually it\u2019s good training for them. \n\nMy parents involved me in adult stuff since I was 15. I sat in all discussions with lawyers when my parents bought our family home. My name is on the home mortgage since I was 20, even though my parents pay it, so I learnt how mortgages work.

He has more than enough time to rebuild. He will presumably have a higher salary as he gets older, and this will, on the whole, not really matter. He makes a lot of money, and nearly all the money he is going to make will happen in the latter half of his career.", "She offered, heck she suggested, a prenup lol so nice try but nope. \n\nThey\u2019re talking about commitment and this guy just showed that he\u2019s impulsive and with poor judgment to boot. He also presented himself as someone with assets so she assumed some degree of stability on his end. \n\nWanting a partner with a certain degree of assets, stability, and good decision-making skills is not \u201cgold digging\u201d lol", "Yeah the better thing would be him paying for all that now that he created the it.", "So why didn\u2019t you buy her a house of her choosing, buy her her own vehicle etc?", "Ok. So all the upkeep, repairs, upgrades \n\nYou\u2019re paying for all of that indefinitely?", "What is there to reconsider, less gold for you to dig?", "Idk that's the kind of stuff that ends relationships, I'd rather get all that out ASAP.  Again, if we disagree 4 years from now that's 4 years I'm losing.", "It\u2019s really not embarrassing, it\u2019s just a mistake. We all make them. Thanks for being so open to learning something new (or remembering something).", "He just tossed his financial security away.

For a woman with a child of her own to consider, who apparently is considering having more children with him, how would that not be a red flag?\n\nThis isn't about digging for gold. This is about someone who hasn't been clear about their own security while actively planning a future with another person.", "Cool and sure it\u2019s nearly impossible for her to feel comfortable ever asking you to leave", "So you\u2019ve guilted her into having you in her life", "He also gave what savings he had.", "I'm also wondering how much was left on the mortgage when he gave her this \"gift\"? I'm guessing he gave her the mortgage so he could just live for free. Same thing with the car. Hopefully his daughter figures it out and tosses him and his girlfriend does the same. In the meantime he's presenting himself to everyone as a generous dad, and getting pats on the back, when the reality is that he's taking advantage of his kid."]}
