You refused to be there for her because of money and you think giving her all of your money will absolve you of your abandonment. Money is not the same as love.

I get that you want to make a big gesture to show your daughter you care and that you're trying to do better, but, giving her everything may not be as valuable as you think.

I mean an 18-year-old is not usually emotionally equipped to deal with a large influx of cash and resources.

Also, money, absolutely does not fix the emotional bond between you and your daughter. Which is the real problem. That being said, it\u2019s your money, you can do with it what you want. I don\u2019t think your girlfriend is an AH either. If you\u2019re going to marry someone, you should absolutely understand their financial situation,.

Quality time with someone goes a lot further than just throwing gifts and money at someone. Now your girlfriend is a walking red flag and you need to end that nonsense now.

Because of this money she got to open her own business which was her dream and I'm here to help her whenever she needs it. She is now way ahead of people her age and yes she gets to have fun and go to adventures like other people her age because she knows I'm here for her and she doesn't need to worry about anything", "I gave it to my responsible and loving child not some random guy on the street", "I have my job, which pays well and I have 2 years worth of saving so I wouldn't say I have absolutely nothing. 35 is not as old as you think a lot of 35yos don't have houses or fancy cars", "Giving away everything you own so that you have nothing for yourself is being broke from your wife's perspective", "You\u2019re employed, yes, but also broke", "But if that job goes what will you have, no home of your own, no car and no income. You're middle aged and have nothing.", "You\u2019ve made a very bizarre decision, jobs can go very easily. If you have the attitude that you can just \u201cget another job\u201d easily, you don\u2019t seem to have matured at all", "Which is still an extreme decision that most of us have never even seen anyone make", "Forget fancy car.  35 should be on the way to owning a paid car and bother retirement and future house savings.\n\n2 years isnt much\n\nYour gf thought you were doing well mid 30, nothing to do with rich at a measely 100k\n\nShe finds out youre a mid 30 with no asset just like anyone either below average or squandered everything for the last decade.\n\nShe was hoping for a partner of somewhat equal standing", "I'm currently living rent free at my daughter's home and I use her car and I'm a healthy man with a good degree so I'm sure I can find a job", "To be fair my wife is also in her mid 30s and doesn't have many assets", "Your future wife or your ex wife?", "Future wife. I forgot to add the \"future\".\n\nI don't have an ex wife", "Wouldn\u2019t want to start a debate but if she doesnt have alot of asset.  Shes still looking for someone who is a doing good 35.  She have good looks? She can land a doing good 35\n\nYou basically \u2018catfished\u2019 her not the right word.  Presenting yourself as a doing good 35 yo and after a year and talking of marriage drop the bomb that you have barely 2 years of savings and living in someone elses house.  Not sure if she knew you didnt own since people rent houses\n\nYoure right alot of 35 yos fall below this line and its sad.  But she can aim higher if she wants\n\nPlenty of 35 sadly dont have $100k in assets. Plenty of 35 should be upwards half a mil by this age between retirement and asset", "I don't think she's a future wife"]}
