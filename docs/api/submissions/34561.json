That is so wildly unnecessary.  \n\nWe allowed our kids a small amount of screen time watching educational stuff on tablets for sheer survival but that was our parenting choice.  It seems like you\u2019ve made a different one and that\u2019s totally valid.  Even if you change your mind later - 65\u201d is overkill and impractical both in its size and lack of portability. \n\nI think it is perfectly valid to return the gift but I\u2019d do it graciously.  \u201cThank you so much for the extremely generous gift.  It was more than we could have ever expected.  However, we don\u2019t really have the space to accommodate it and we\u2019ve made the choice that we are not going to have screen time for baby for the foreseeable future based on our research.

You have specifically mentioned to everyone it sounds like your desire to have limited screen time, and then father in law happens to buy your 5 month old the largest tv in the house.   \n\nAnd your husband is worried about offending his dad?!?\n\nHis dad did this on purpose, to show you he thinks your rule is ridiculous and shove that tv literally in everyone\u2019s face in objection.  He needs to be shown fast that kind of stuff won\u2019t cut any ice. And don\u2019t let your husband say \u2018my wife said\u2026.\u2019.

I wonder if the present was given as a deliberate attempt to put you in a no win situation", "INFO: Is your husband refusing to get rid of the TV, or refusing to return it to his dad? If he thinks it'll keep the peace better for you to sell or donate the TV than to ask his dad to take it back, I think that's legit.

Boundaries definitely need to be set with your in laws and your husband needs to step up and do it now!  If he doesn't do it now it will just get worse! He should simply explain the TV is too large.  Offer no other explanation.  I wouldn't mention limiting screen time.  It will end up being a discussion about you FIL thinks kids should be raised and I doubt you want to have that conversation.\n\nBefore her birthday, I would suggest making a list of gifts for baby.  Like a membership to a zoo or museum, photoshoot in honor of her birthday.  Things like that.  When she is old enough steer them to \"adventures\" for gifts.

That gift gets returned no matter what, even if you have to return it yourself.\n\nNTA", "nta sell it and put the money in a bank account for baby every time they buy something you don\u2019t want/agree with sell and put in the bank account. maybe when child is 18 she will have enough money for college mol", "NTA -- if there have been boundary issues, and im assuming youve addressed them before, you need to enforce them here. This is a great place to start if you haven't addressed these boundary issues before. There's also a very nice way to go about this returning the TV that can keep the offense to a minimum.

How much you and your baby watch it is up yo you. That\u2019s an awesome gift for your family.", "OP opt for a compromise that for both sides since it's the first grandchild and that you mentioned surpassing boundaries in the gift giving, it would be beneficial that you suggest that instead of such lavish gifts like a 65\" screen tv that the opportunity of starting a 529 Education Plan for her would be a much better idea. It may sound ridiculous and impractical for children to get an overabundance of gifts that they may never have a chance to wear out, but it'll be a great start for her education with a nice tax deduction for the grandparents.", "NAH - Can you give it away or sell it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Since they gifted you so generously I understand you don't want to offend them. The way I see it you have two choices:\n\n\\- make a statement early on or they will continue to push you boundaries more as the child becomes older. They might do that anyways though\n\n\\-sell or return the TV for cash and spend it on something more appropriate for the child.
