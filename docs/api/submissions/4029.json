{"id": 4029, "submission_id": "zdemio", "title": "AITA for making my daughter miss her Homecoming Dance to help her sister?", "selftext": "I have four children but this involves just my two daughters.  My oldest daughter (24) is in college in another state that's a two day car trip away.  She's always had some difficulties growing up handling the transition to adulthood.  She also always tends to get into bad relationships.  Well her most recent relationship fell apart recently and she needed to move to a new apartment since she was being kicked out of the complex after the guy left and she couldnt afford rent.\n\nThe apartment was also really dirty and she needed me to help clean it up since they had a pet parrot uncaged and didn't have the money to pay damages.  I planned on doing the drive down to her university to help with the move but she needed to move the weekend of my other daughter (17) homecoming dance.  Daughter 17 was in the homecoming not as a queen but she was voted attendant.  I made my youngest cancel her plans and do the trip with me since I needed help driving and she could drive while I napped.  She's also on her learners permit so the experience was a good lesson for her.  She made mistakes but I think she learned a lot like the right way to pump gas after it spilled on her.  She's still mad at me for having to miss the dance and the gas issue and says she \"constantly\" is giving up experiences for her other siblings.  Yes, it can be hard to be the youngest but that's just how it goes.  She blabbed about her feelings to my brother and he said he's disappointed in me.  AITA?  I think this is just how it goes some times.  Family has to support each other.  Helping her sister is more important than a dance in the end.\n\nPlease stop messaging me hate.\n\nTo answer questions.  I'm divorced.  My eldest children's father travels for work and now that they are older than 18 I really have no contact with him.  He doesn't have much of a relationship with my sons or eldest daughter but he paid for college tuition.  My younger daughter has a different dad and he's not around much.\n\nWe drive everywhere because I don't like flying especially nowadays.\n\nNo, it was not my youngest daughters last dance.  She still can go to prom in the spring and will probably be voted to court as well.My sons are older and busy with their lives in other states.  They also don't need to know about their sisters private issues.  That would embarrass her further and hurt their relationship.\n\nNo, I don't have a favorite child.  I love them all equally and expect them to support each other.\n\nNo my youngest has never had to miss a major event before.  She's been unhappy because she had to spend so much time at her siblings events and practices growing up.  I know that wasn't the most fun for her, but she got to spend a lot of time reading and now she has excellent grades.

You could have planned better. You could have left earlier, stopped at a motel part of the way through to nap, and kept going. \n\nYou punished her for your other daughter's mistakes.

Let you child be a child. Let your adult daughter be an adult. If it was life altering, sure, take her with you. But it was due to your irresponsible daughter needing help cleaning an apartment?

Bad situation for your older daughter. But doesn\u2019t she have any friends that could help out? If you can\u2019t make the two day car trip on your own, just fly or take a bus or train. What is wrong with you? Act like that more often and you and your older daughter can share a place because your other kids will go no contact.

How is you failing to raise a competent adult, then jumping in to clean up her mess have anything to do with your 17 y/o daughter? \n\nForcing her to miss a very important event in her life so you can nap on a trip (illegal since she is still on a learner's permit and you must be attentive at all times) fair?\n\nYou're being a terrible parent.", "YTA \u2026. You will not need to worry about helping this daughter in a few years\u2026. She will be NC WITH YOU", "YTA. Your youngest daughter should not be cleaning up her older adult sister's messes.

My oldest daughter (24) is in college in another state that's a two day car trip away.  She's always had some difficulties growing up handling the transition to adulthood.  She also always tends to get into bad relationships.  Well her most recent relationship fell apart recently and she needed to move to a new apartment since she was being kicked out of the complex after the guy left and she couldnt afford rent.  \n\nThe apartment was also really dirty and she needed me to help clean it up since they had a pet parrot uncaged and didn't have the money to pay damages.  I planned on doing the drive down to her university to help with the move but she needed to move the weekend of my other daughter (17) homecoming dance.  Daughter 17 was in the homecoming not as a queen but she was voted attendant.  I made my youngest cancel her plans and do the trip with me since I needed help driving and she could drive while I napped.  She's also on her learners permit so the experience was a good lesson for her.  She made mistakes but I think she learned a lot like the right way to pump gas after it spilled on her.  She's still mad at me for having to miss the dance and the gas issue and says she \"constantly\" is giving up experiences for her other siblings.  Yes, it can be hard to be the youngest but that's just how it goes.  She blabbed about her feelings to my brother and he said he's disappointed in me.  AITA?  I think this is just how it goes some times.  Family has to support each other.  Helping her sister is more important than a dance in the end.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Cut the umbilical cord with your oldest and let her figure her own stuff out and leave the youngest alone. You are not being a good mom and have lost all sense of priorities. It\u2019s not your daughter\u2019s responsibility to help you with this or help her sister because she doesn\u2019t have her sh*t together and she definitely doesn\u2019t owe you or her sister anything because \u201cyour family \u201c that\u2019s BS.", "YTA and this isn't \"just how it goes\" sometimes.

She was being kicked out of the apartment because she couldn\u2019t afford rent after the guy left\u2026..why did she not realize she couldn\u2019t afford it when he left and contact her landlord to terminate her lease without her having to get **kicked out**. The apartments a mess, okay, usually people have to clean up when they move out. They also don\u2019t usually call their mommies/daddies to help. Because most adults who are responsible enough to live alone don\u2019t have a freaking damage causing parrot flying loose around the apartment. \n\nInfo: how does your adult manage to feed, bathe, and clothe herself with you living two days drive away? It seems she missed out on many basic life skills. \n\nYour child was voted as a homecoming attendant. That\u2019s a big deal to most high schoolers. And unless things have changed a lot, don\u2019t they not announce the queen until either the dance itself or the football game the day before? Presumably you were already driving the day before, meaning she wouldn\u2019t have been able to be at the game if that\u2019s where it\u2019s announced. Even if they do announce it ahead of time now, you ruined one of her last high school memories. Better tell your adult to find a new guy now so they can break up just in time for you to ruin prom too. \n\nMore info: you have two sons?? why couldn\u2019t they go with you??? If they\u2019re younger, who stayed and took care of them, and why couldn\u2019t that person go with you to baby your adult? If your child is old enough and responsible enough to drive with her learners permit across several states while you take a nice little nap, surely she\u2019s responsible enough to watch your sons (if they are in fact younger.) \n\nAlso just had the realization that you allowed your daughter to drive across the country meaning interstates/highways/etc while you were snoozing, yet she didn\u2019t know how to get gas\u2026..soooo I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t have nearly enough driving practice in to be doing highways unsupervised. \n\nUgh I could go on and on and on.

Why couldn\u2019t you have told your eldest \u201cthat\u2019s just how it goes\u201d when she needed to move when her sister wasn\u2019t available to help? You\u2019re teaching your eldest that she doesn\u2019t need to make good choices because there\u2019s a really convenient safety net in place. You\u2019re also signaling to her that she is more important than others and should expect loving relationships to come with a sacrifice. If her younger sister loves her, she must be willing to give up the dance she was really excited for to help out, right? What does that teach your eldest about what love looks like? I\u2019d bet she keeps dating these terrible partners because she\u2019s modeling her behavior and expectations on what you\u2019ve shown her to be acceptable.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even talking about what this favoritism does to the youngest daughter. You\u2019ll be lucky if she chooses to stay in contact with you as she ages.

Life isn't 100% responsibility and work and your mental health and the moments that make life time memories are worth prioritizing is a good parenting message.\n\nMissing school to spend 4+ days wiping the poop up from an uncaged bird and driving mom while she naps is just deprioritizing the young girl's views on her own responsibilities and school work to drive home the message that someone will come save you no matter how bad you fuck up. What a bad message for a parent to send."]}
