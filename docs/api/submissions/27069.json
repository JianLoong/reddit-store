A few days ago it was her brother's (George) wedding and we attended. \n\nUs and a few of our friends were at the same table later at the venue. Turns out my girlfriend's half sister (26f), let's call her R, was invited and was assigned at the same table as me and my gf. \n\nI have to note that R is my mother in law's daughter she had right before she had Alexa and then completely abandoned R with her dad to live her life with Alexa's dad. They hadn't found out about R's existence until mother in law confessed to George that she had a daughter before them. So George reached out and found R and she was happy to maintain a relationship with them, but Alexa was completely against it and didn't even want to meet her. That's why R and Alexa don't get along. That was 4 years back. I also have to say that i have met R and we got along well.\n\nSince R didn't know anyone else at the wedding George put her at the same table as me and Alexa and our friends. The second Alexa saw her , her mood changed. She kept throwing little \"innocent\" insults at her and then said she was just joking. R didn't really seam to mind until Alexa said \"So , R how's your dad?\" I almost lost it then. R's dad passed when she was 15 and everyone knew. R didn't say anything but just looked at her with an almost pitiful look. She then excused herself and went to get a drink. \n\nI turn to Alexa and tell her that if she doesn't stop being a bitch and apologizes I will leave her right there and then. Alexa got defensive saying that I'm defending R because I'm attracted to her and that i want to give her a \"pity f@ck\" because she's the poor orphan. She said all that in front of everyone.\n\nI ignored her for the rest of the night and when it was time to leave i left her at home and went to sleep at my house.\n\nATAH?\n\nSorry for bad English I was never good at essays\n\nEdit:when I said i would leave her i didn't mean break up i meant leave the venue and leave her without a ride home", "created_utc": 1694964734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l3o6z/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_to_stop_being_a/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your girlfriend is a classic bully and mean girl. She sounds absolutely insufferable. She is upset because she's no longer her mother's oldest child and is completely jealous of her half sister for no reason at all. The half sister did not ask to be born or to literally be abandoned by her own mother. And your girlfriend instead of being compassionate and a decent person, is exactly what you called her. Do you really want that kind of person as your girlfriend, a potential future wife, and mother to your own children?", "Is the type of person you want to spend your life with?  YWBTA if you don\u2019t break up.  It was cruel of your soon to be ex girlfriend", "NTA.  Honestly, Alexa sounds very petty and mean spirited, mixed with her likely jealousy.  I find her behavior beyond remotely acceptable and personally wouldn't care to be around someone like that.  God forbid if she turns this behavior on you at some point, but know that you have seen it firsthand and have been forewarned.", "NTA. What's wrong with your girlfriend?", "You'd be an AH for staying tbh lol", "Why in God\u2019s name have you not broken up with this person?", "NTA- she\u2019s incapable of empathy for someone who was literally abandoned by her mother and orphaned at 15?! I\u2019m thinking she showed you and everyone at your table the horrid person that she is and she probably takes after her mother.", "NTA. As a qualification, I would say calling your girlfriend a bitch isn't exactly the best move. That qualification aside, your girlfriend is unfairly penalizing R for their mother's actions (which I am going to refrain from evaluating since that's not the point) and acting viciously (making jabs all night; asking R how her deceased father is doing). I think it was fair for you to call that out. I also think your girlfriend's response to you is likewise vicious. Your girlfriend is misplacing her anger and it sounds like she needs to have a longer conversation with her mom rather than taking it out on R (who was abandoned by their mom).", "NTA. Honestly, if she wants to act like that, do you really want to be with her? She sounds like a selfish brat.", "Your GF is gross. R showed admirable restraint when faced with awful treatment. You are NTA but GF is a massive one", "NTA \n\nWow. She is showing you exactly the kind of person she is. I think you need to believe her and leave her.", "NTA. You should have threatened to leave-leave her!  What an asshole!  See all the spite she directs at her half-sister?  That could be directed at you one day!  A little of it was that night, it seems.  Defending the poor girl, publicly humiliating you?  Oh no, sweetheart, get out while you still can. You\u2019re dating the wicked stepsister (half sister)!!!", "I don't get it.\n\nAlexa's mom left R practically right after birth to be with Alexa's dad.\n\nNeither R nor Alexa had anything to do with that, but if anything, R is the one who could have been sour towards Alexa as Alexa got to spend her life with their mother.\n\nThe very mother who ABANDONED R.\n\nThere's NO REASON AT ALL for Alexa to behave like this towards R.\n\nNTA\n\nINFO : Is this an example of Alexa's normal behaviour? \n\nIf it is, you might want to reconsider being with her. \n\nIf not, you might want to sit her down and get to the bottom of this.", "R is a better person than me for letting that shit slide", "holy shit NTA your girlfriend is horrible", "NTA, but just barely because I feel you SHOULD have left her at the wedding after her comment about you being attracted to R.  I am also giving you a side-eye for being with a shitty person like this for **three years** which I am guessing means you are okay with her terrible behavior towards others.", "NTA\n\nToss this stinky fish back in the sea. She is a passive aggressive instigator of drama. Life is too short to deal with that kind of stench. \n\nI know it is a complicated family thing, but that was just shitty behavior. She can't even control herself through one meal. Nor does she have the emotional intelligence needed to realize that her half sister did not ask to be born. R is in no way responsible for the events or choices that your GF is mad about. \n\nThat's the real problem. She takes out her negative emotions on innocent people. Take note. She is showing you who she really is. Is this the kind of viper you want around children? \n\nHowever, the person who did the seating arrangement was either the real AH or an accidental saint for letting you know just what type of person your GF is.", "Def not the AH. You're calling your gf out on unacceptable behavior. It's one thing not to like someone but its a whole other things to be openly hostile", "NTA. It seems like ur girlfriend is little jealous on her step sister and you guys getting along well probably made her feel even more insecure", "NTA, you should hook up with R.", "NTA. Alexa was mean and you were right to point it out. I wouldn\u2019t have used that choice of words, but you got your point across.\n\nWas R, Alexa and George\u2019s mother at the wedding? You don\u2019t mention whether there was any kind of reconciliation between her and R. As the child who was abandoned it must have been hard to show up, R has my respect.", "Your girl sounds like she\u2019s jealous. \n\nI feel bad for R. Being unwanted by her mother to the degree her new family knew nothing of her. Her father passing away when she was young and now being bullied by this adult brat. Heartless.", "Nta. What kids do you expect to raise with this person?", "That particular thing that you told your girlfriend to stop being one of?\n\nHere's the news flash for you: she's a raging one.

Leave that relationship IMMEDIATELY. I don't need to say any more on it. If you still stay with someone who would make such remarks, that becomes a reflection on you. Don't be that guy", "NTA -  Why are you with someone so insufferably callous?\n\nYou seem like a caring person, respectful, who isn't attacking someone else for no reason (unlike that GF of yours) so... is she blackmailing you to stay with her?? Because I cannot even imagine being around someone twho acts like that, let alone *dating them*. Knowing they treat others that way would be the absolute biggest turn-off for me.\n\nThis absolute hag just accused you of being attracted to, and wanting to pity F, her half-sister... because you were polite and civilized to her. Because you called your (terrible)GF out on her poor and embarrassing behavior. Wow.", "NTA\n\nThe kindest act R\u2019s mother ever did was staying out of R\u2019s life so she wouldn\u2019t become a toxic adult like Alexa.", "Like mother like daughter. Her mother has conditioned her daughter to act like an asshole. It\u2019s not R\u2019s fault that their mother abandoned R to be with Alexa\u2019s father. It was very cruel of Alexa to treat R that way. When you ask yourself where did she get her shitty behavior? Welp, the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree with mother. You may want to reevaluate your relationship with Alexa and see if that is someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. I would say no, because it has bothered you in such a way that you have given her the cold shoulder. With good reason, I would\u2019ve done the same thing. \n\nI think you get along with R better, but I am just reading a few paragraphs from you, I don\u2019t know if you were just trying to be nice and come to R\u2019s aid, or you may like her? I would like to see that play out much better. I think Alexa is just downright rude and they say you are the company you keep. So, with that being said, you were definitely NTA for dropping Alexa off and going to your own house. I personally would\u2019ve broken up with her right then and there. You deserve to be happy, OP.
