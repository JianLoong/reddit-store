A few days ago it was her brother's (George) wedding and we attended. \n\nUs and a few of our friends were at the same table later at the venue. Turns out my girlfriend's half sister (26f), let's call her R, was invited and was assigned at the same table as me and my gf. \n\nI have to note that R is my mother in law's daughter she had right before she had Alexa and then completely abandoned R with her dad to live her life with Alexa's dad. They hadn't found out about R's existence until mother in law confessed to George that she had a daughter before them. So George reached out and found R and she was happy to maintain a relationship with them, but Alexa was completely against it and didn't even want to meet her. That's why R and Alexa don't get along. That was 4 years back. I also have to say that i have met R and we got along well.\n\nSince R didn't know anyone else at the wedding George put her at the same table as me and Alexa and our friends. The second Alexa saw her , her mood changed. She kept throwing little \"innocent\" insults at her and then said she was just joking. R didn't really seam to mind until Alexa said \"So , R how's your dad?\" I almost lost it then. R's dad passed when she was 15 and everyone knew. R didn't say anything but just looked at her with an almost pitiful look. She then excused herself and went to get a drink. \n\nI turn to Alexa and tell her that if she doesn't stop being a bitch and apologizes I will leave her right there and then. Alexa got defensive saying that I'm defending R because I'm attracted to her and that i want to give her a \"pity f@ck\" because she's the poor orphan. She said all that in front of everyone.\n\nI ignored her for the rest of the night and when it was time to leave i left her at home and went to sleep at my house.\n\nATAH?\n\nSorry for bad English I was never good at essays\n\nEdit:when I said i would leave her i didn't mean break up i meant leave the venue and leave her without a ride home", "created_utc": 1694964734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l3o6z/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_to_stop_being_a/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your girlfriend is a classic bully and mean girl. She sounds absolutely insufferable. She is upset because she's no longer her mother's oldest child and is completely jealous of her half sister for no reason at all. The half sister did not ask to be born or to literally be abandoned by her own mother. And your girlfriend instead of being compassionate and a decent person, is exactly what you called her. Do you really want that kind of person as your girlfriend, a potential future wife, and mother to your own children?", "Is the type of person you want to spend your life with?  YWBTA if you don\u2019t break up.  It was cruel of your soon to be ex girlfriend", "NTA.  Honestly, Alexa sounds very petty and mean spirited, mixed with her likely jealousy.

As a qualification, I would say calling your girlfriend a bitch isn't exactly the best move.

I think it was fair for you to call that out. I also think your girlfriend's response to you is likewise vicious. Your girlfriend is misplacing her anger and it sounds like she needs to have a longer conversation with her mom rather than taking it out on R (who was abandoned by their mom).", "NTA.

She is a passive aggressive instigator of drama. Life is too short to deal with that kind of stench. \n\nI know it is a complicated family thing, but that was just shitty behavior.

You may want to reevaluate your relationship with Alexa and see if that is someone you want to spend the rest of your life with.

A mature woman would discuss things privately not causing a scene, and to not humiliate the other person that they are with and to be respectful towards herself, and others around her. She also did try to humiliate R in front of everyone, that is incredibly immature, does she not care about the words she says out of her mouth in public?
