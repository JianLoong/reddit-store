This is a living situation built on deception. You\u2019re living with another couple, their pet, and then a baby at some future point. They\u2019ll be dominating the space before you know it and you\u2019ll be in the way of them playing house. \n\nIf possible, I\u2019d try to remove yourself and your boyfriend from the lease and find another place to live. I could be wrong about the situation and things will be fine, but there\u2019s no way there won\u2019t be tension.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t feel like an AITA topic bc there\u2019s not an argument", "NTA. She has completely manipulated you and the entire situation. Move out as soon as possible and consider cutting ties altogether. She\u2019s not the kind of person you need in your life.", "NTA, but also - your living situation will become unmanageable soon. You have an extra dog and soon a child at home. The whole space will be overtakenby baby things and the kid crying and their routine (or lack of one) WILL impact your life, don't delude yourself into thinking it won't.\n\nI'd rethink the living situation.", "NTA  \nAnd I think you should try to move out with your bf ASAP, because your best friend, her bf, child and pet will continue to dominate the space in the house, and if you continue to confront her, it'll be a big mess and I don't think you can handle that, which make you'll soon regret.  \nIf you want her to pay back for lying to you, then just move out and live a happy life, that's the best revenge.  \nIn my life, I've heard a lot of stories that have the same situation as you, and the end for the \"confronting till the end\" kind never be happy ever after.", "NTA and don't move in a couple with kids that isn't related to you if you don't want trouble in your life.", "NTA. How do you plan to divide rent now that her boyfriend is also moving in? Let her keep the main room if you plan on continuing with this arrangement but be sure to enforce boundaries and stick to them. e.g. being kind enough to take care of puppy, future babysitting, helping with food, etc. because clearly, she will exploit your friendship to the highest degree.", "NTA- get off that lease ASAP they made their bed they can lie in it.  Literally and figuratively.", "When people starts lying and act like fine - RUN! \ud83d\ude48 that\u2019s one thing i dont like sharing places .", "NTA. Also don\u2019t move in with this couple, you will regret it and it will be a shit show.", "Find another place move on she is shitty", "This isn\u2019t TikTok, we are adults, you can spell out the word \u201ccondom\u201d here. \nNTA", "NTA. \nYou\u2019re best friends, she shouldn\u2019t have lied to you to get her way. If that was something she really wanted she should\u2019ve been honest and told to about it rather than lie to you and manipulate you to get her way. \n\nThey planned to have baby. I can\u2019t imagine not telling my best friend that. Instead, she lied and cried and made out as if she didn\u2019t want the child to gain your sympathy to get the Master bedroom and have her boyfriend live with you with a puppy. \n\nYou\u2019re in for a rough ride, a puppy and a baby in one house, good luck! Expect damage, noise, and faeces. I bet she\u2019ll lean on you for a lot of support with dog/baby sitting and dog walking too. She seems selfish. \n\nIt\u2019ll only get worse from here, I speak from TP experience. Cancel the plan and get a home nearby instead, don\u2019t share. You\u2019ll want your space and boundaries. \n\nAlso, definitely address the situation!", "NTA, but ignore the other comments here and have a serious conversation with her before you take drastic action.", "NTA .\n\nyour friend's a liar , light her pants on fire . dont let her get away with this", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
