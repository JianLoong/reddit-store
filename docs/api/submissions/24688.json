This is a living situation built on deception. You\u2019re living with another couple, their pet, and then a baby at some future point. They\u2019ll be dominating the space before you know it and you\u2019ll be in the way of them playing house. \n\nIf possible, I\u2019d try to remove yourself and your boyfriend from the lease and find another place to live. I could be wrong about the situation and things will be fine, but there\u2019s no way there won\u2019t be tension.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t feel like an AITA topic bc there\u2019s not an argument", "NTA.

The whole space will be overtakenby baby things and the kid crying and their routine (or lack of one) WILL impact your life, don't delude yourself into thinking it won't.\n\nI'd rethink the living situation.", "NTA  \nAnd I think you should try to move out with your bf ASAP, because your best friend, her bf, child and pet will continue to dominate the space in the house, and if you continue to confront her, it'll be a big mess and I don't think you can handle that, which make you'll soon regret.  \nIf you want her to pay back for lying to you, then just move out and live a happy life, that's the best revenge.  \nIn my life, I've heard a lot of stories that have the same situation as you, and the end for the \"confronting till the end\" kind never be happy ever after.", "NTA and don't move in a couple with kids that isn't related to you if you don't want trouble in your life.", "NTA. How do you plan to divide rent now that her boyfriend is also moving in? Let her keep the main room if you plan on continuing with this arrangement but be sure to enforce boundaries and stick to them. e.g. being kind enough to take care of puppy, future babysitting, helping with food, etc. because clearly, she will exploit your friendship to the highest degree.", "NTA- get off that lease ASAP they made their bed they can lie in it.

I can\u2019t imagine not telling my best friend that.

Expect damage, noise, and faeces. I bet she\u2019ll lean on you for a lot of support with dog/baby sitting and dog walking too. She seems selfish. \n\nIt\u2019ll only get worse from here, I speak from TP experience. Cancel the plan and get a home nearby instead, don\u2019t share.
