You not only insulted them, you calculated the most hurtful way you could insult them, and worse, picking a demographic trait.\n\nFinally, when your manager rightfully reamed you out for your shocking offense, your response was something short of an acknowledgement of fault or a willingness to learn.\n\nI think you *should* have been fired on the spot.", "This is the way!
