That's totally fine. But I think what your manager should have communicated to you (calmly, because you are a person and therefore deserving of civility) is that in service-oriented fields, it's usually not about who's \"right,\" but rather, about doing what it takes to keep a customer's business. In this case, the church lady did NOT deserve an apology, no. But, just smiling and nodding and keeping your snarky comment to yourself would have made it so that your manager didn't have an excuse to go off on you. Again, not that it was your fault per se\u2014but actions have consequences and you are undoubtedly going to come up against this again and again in future jobs, even white collar ones, because customers and clients are the same at every level.\n\nSo, pick your battles. You could afford to lose this job\u2014okay. But in the future, it may be your desire to make a snarky comment vs you keeping the job you need to pay your rent/utilities. If nothing else, you don't want future supervisors having reason to think you don't have the temperament for promotions or raises over what is, at the end of the day, a petty lady showing her ass over a late pizza delivery. Some battles aren't worth the consequences, so learn to choose wisely going forward.", "Nta", "NTA and I completely agree with calling the church and telling them what happened.

Your report would not matter because you are not one of the \"good people\".

And it was obviously pre-meditated on her part because she constantly called and let her anger fester the whole time.", "Sorry I think there might be some confusion I wasn\u2019t talking about OP at all, I was saying a lot of customers in this situation react the same way as the church lady.

She was told it would be a late delivery, if she didn't like that, she could have ordered from anywhere else. She then was rude to the driver, who wasn't responsible for the food being late, and didn't have the authority to magically not make it be late, because she already knew if she took that tone with someone with authority her order might be canceled and she might be banned.\n\nWe all have those thoughts in customer service jobs, the trick is that we don't say it out loud, as much as I sympathize and think we should get to put rude customers in their place. So you were a little bit ah, but fully justified.", "NTA and as a Christian, your response to her was very laid back and not knocking her religion, it was showing a mirror to how she was acting compared to how the bible asks us to react. I would have said the same thing to her and then pull out scripture to add emphasis.", "NTA. Your manager is the AH.", "NTA\n\nYou were not mocking her religion you were mocking her.  But so many of those types of \"Christians\" have completely un-Christ-like behavior.\n\nYou were a little rude, but she was completely off the rails rude.  You should have responded with \"I am terribly sorry, but I had to feed the sick children first.\"  That may have shut her up.", "NTA. If God cared, he would've given them food. He didn't. That's why I haven't died yet.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even call this mocking. You\u2019re just correct", "NTA I'm a Christian and am appaled by her behavior (though unfortunately not surprised). She wasn't living out the tenants of her own faith and you called her on it. Good for you!", "Y T A for being nice and waiting to quit until the end of your shift...NTA for everything else", "NTA I suggest giving her church a call, on the off chance that maybe they actually won't want to condone such behavior.", "NTA, I'm sick to death of people like her. They don't practice what they preach, it's always rules for thee not for me. They act like just because they're religious it automatically makes them a good person when half the time they are the rudest, most judgemental and entitled people you will ever meet and then they cry persecution when you call them out on it. It's no wonder churches are finding their pews empty these days.", "fuck religion nta", "And this woman deals with children!

Being screamed at and hurled verbal abuse.

You want 10 pizzas, 3 dozen tacos, or 15 sandwiches by x time, call a few days ahead, so things can be prepped, staff can be adjusted if necessary etc.... this lady was a complete ass cursing out staff for her failure to plan. Between customers and managers like this is the reason the food industry is so short staffed.", "I have to agree. It seems like OP would rather say nothing than apologize, which sucks because it's not their fault, but it's really never a smart idea to cop an attitude back at a grumpy customer.

It's the boss's fault for yelling at her employee. Or, oh, wait, no, it's the fault of the hospital for making a big order without pre-arranging it so as to not disrupt usual business operations. Or is it the fault of the children at the church for wanting pizza?\n\nPeople are responsible for their own actions and choices. Not some random temper-tantrum someone else throws."]}
