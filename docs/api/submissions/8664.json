It is illegal for businesses that serve the public to discriminate on the basis of religion, and by pairing a comment about the customer's religion alongside what to them was a negative experience (your slow delivery), you could have created the impression that the *reason* you were slow was because your store did not like their religion. That could have greatly harmed your employer.\n\nThat's before we get to you mocking your customer. You not only insulted them, you calculated the most hurtful way you could insult them, and worse, picking a demographic trait.\n\nFinally, when your manager rightfully reamed you out for your shocking offense, your response was something short of an acknowledgement of fault or a willingness to learn.\n\nI think you *should* have been fired on the spot.", "This is the way!

For sure. ESH\n\nIt doesn't mean you weren't a dick for what you said. She was a child, and you had an opportunity to be the bigger person and walk out of there extremely Christ like.
