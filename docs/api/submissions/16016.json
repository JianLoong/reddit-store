{"id": 16016, "submission_id": "1337f8h", "title": "AITA for breaking a promise and attending my stepdaughter's graduation?", "selftext": "I\u2019ll start by explaining some backstory. I (54M) lost my first wife when my son (25M) and daughter (22F) were ages 9 and 12, Both my kids took it as hard as you would expect and to this day have a poor relationship with both my current wife \"Doreen (49F)\" and my stepdaughter \"Amy (18F)\". I started dating Doreen about 4 months after my first wife passed, as such my kids believe I cheated on their mom. Amy was 5 when we got together and as such I see her as my own daughter.\n\nOn to the actual story, 4 years ago, two days before Kay's high school graduation, Amy got very ill while visiting her grandparents and ended up needing emergency surgery. My wife and I rushed to be with Amy and admittedly I did not communicate well with Kay. At the time Kay didn't pick up my calls, so I left her a voicemail and several text messages explaining what happened and telling Kay I was sorry but I would make it up to her. A few hours go by and I get a call from Kay, she is in hysterics telling me what a terrible father I am and stated that if I did not attend her graduation I would be dead to her. I chose to support Amy.\n\nTrue to her words, Kay did not contact me on the day of her graduation. And when came home Kay's things had been moved out of the house with a note explaining that we were no longer family and to never contact her again.\n\nLuckily Kay and I were able to reconcile, however, I promised her I would give her absolutely anything in the world to make her forgive me. She said that she would forgive me as long as I refused to attend Amy's graduation as this was the only way to make it fair. I agreed at the time thinking she was just joking or angry and would soon forget. \n\nThis leads me to now. Invitations for Amy's graduation went out, and despite all the hostility Amy wanted to make sure Kay got one. Kay called Amy later that day and said she would be unable to attend as she and I would be spending the day together per our agreement. Amy broke down into tears asking me why I was missing her graduation, I assured her I was not and that I would speak to Kay. Later I explained to Kay that I simply could not miss Amy's graduation. Kay launched into a tirade about how I was a liar and an asshole and how could I do this to her again. I told her that we would talk when she calmed down and she said we would never talk again.\n\nMy son, and several of our extended family have all taken Kay's side saying I didn't see how hurt she was at graduation. My wife believes I am the asshole for even promising that in the first place as I should have known it would only upset one or both girls. And Amy is just sad and confused wondering why Kay hates her. I know keeping my promise and not attending Amy's graduation is probably the only way to salvage my relationship with Kay, but no matter how I look at it I would feel like I'm punishing Amy for having a medical issue, so am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682804151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1337f8h/aita_for_breaking_a_promise_and_attending_my/", "score": 1697, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re clutching at straws here in the hope that someone will validate your poor parenting choices. \n\nShe moved out all those years ago - YOU\u2019RE ALREADY ON YOUR SECOND CHANCE.\n\nYou provide Amy with two parents all the time and you choose to leave Kay with no parents. Every time you choose Amy over Kay you orphan her.\n\nThe only way you get to keep three kids is to skip Amy\u2019s graduation as promised and you should have told Amy about this long, long ago. However, you being the poor excuse for a parent that you seem to be you thought that you\u2019d just blank this promise to the child whose graduation you skipped.\n\nIf you break it, you lose Kay and you\u2019ll likely lose your son too.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: and let\u2019s not even bother going down the new woman while your children are still grieving the loss of their mother route.

Now YTA for prioritizing the step daughter again. 5 months in a new relationship after your wife died was also probably another YTA moment not giving your kids enough time to grieve with your support- you created that poor family bond yourself. So yup YTA all the way around. Leave Kay alone she deserves better.", "YTA - you replaced your kids mom with a new family 4 months after she died!  Your kids lost their mom so young and you don\u2019t seem like you prioritized their feelings or helped them deal with things, instead you moved on fast. \n\nKay didn\u2019t have a mother to attend her graduation and she needed you there.  Could you not have driven to the grad then back to the hospital?", "YTA\n\nWas Amy in an unstable condition? Was she still critically ill? If she got ill 2 days prior to the graduation, and admitted that day, she should be feeling better after 2 days. And her BIOLOGICAL mom was there with her. \n\nWho was there for Kay? NOT YOU\n\nNow Amy's graduation is coming up, and that will probably be a day where Kay will remember how YOU let her down.\nIt sounds like the only way to somewhat save your relationship with Kay is to not attend Amy's graduation - and Amy will still have a parent there; her mom. That is still better than what Kay had.", ">I started dating Doreen about 4 months after my first wife passed, as such my kids believe I cheated on their mom.\n\nSo you don't deny it. Okay.\n\n>Amy got very ill while visiting her grandparents and ended up needing emergency surgery.

You consistently put your step daughter above Kay. You shouldn\u2019t have promised Kay that at all, you knew you would not keep the promise but gave it anyway! Why would you do that? It shows you don\u2019t value keeping your word to Kay. Also your step daughter is 18 show her this post so she understands its you that is the issue not her.

You definitely were!", "YTA\n\nAnd have been for years. You are a bad father. Kay is correct. You are a liar. You've done nothing to prioritize Kay ever since your new family rolled in. Your relationship with your daughter is dead and the blood is on your hands.", "YTA for making a promise that you're now going back on. What were you thinking? Say anything to get her to talk to you again? That's a bad thing and you likely just totally torpedoed your relationship with both your daughter and your son.\n\nStop saying things and making promises that are convenient in the present that you don't intend to honor in the future. It's probably too late for your older kids. But you should keep that in mind so you don't mess up your relationship with your current wife and stepdaughter.", "YTA. You shouldn't have promised something you weren't willing to follow through on. \n\nAlso, why wouldn't you go to Kay's graduation ceremony while Doreen was with Amy, then return to see Amy after the ceremony? \n\nIt does sound like you are choosing Amy over Kay, and you created this monster by starting to date so soon after your wife's death. \n\nYou aren't thinking about how your actions affect your kids.", "4 months later after your wife passed  ?

That\u2019s not normal or ok. Kay was old enough to take care of her basic needs, but you just abandoned her for 3+ days.

Your second AH moment was choosing to stay with your step daughter when she had her mother and grandparents with her, and leaving your own daughter without a parent at graduation, which was obviously very important to her. Your third AH moment was promising her you wouldn't go to your stepdaughter's graduation and then going anyway. You've shown her over and over that her feelings don't matter.

Both of my parents died relatively early and missed milestones, so I have a sense of what Kay is feeling.

Kay, who was already missing her mama at this event, felt abandoned and completely alone. This was 100% your fault due to your choice to prioritize Amy over Kay. Subsequently, you made a promise to Kay to try and get back in her life. It was ill-advised and perhaps even idiotic to say that you\u2019d not attend Amy\u2019s graduation. But dude, you did it and now you get to lie in the bed you made. The idea of Amy\u2019s feelings being hurt is too much of a burden for you to bear, but you seen to have completely ignored the great hurt you CHOSE to inflict on your actual daughter.

First, don\u2019t make promises you won\u2019t keep. Second, it wasn\u2019t a reasonable as k from Kay and you should have just said no from the start. That\u2019s probably more what Kay was looking for, tbh. It sounds like she just needed another reason to kick you out of her life for good. Instead of focusing on the graduation, look back at her entire childhood and try to be honest with yourself about every decision you made that hurt Kay and every time you prioritized your wife and Amy over her. This situation calls for brutal self-honesty and you need to be ready to take ownerships of your mistakes. She may still not want a relationship with you.

I usually don't judge people on for moving on quickly after a partner passes, but it's different when you have children who've lost a parent and are struggling. This is a situation where I believe they should have been prioritized until they got out of the worst stage of grief. 4 months is FAST in the context of losing a mom.\n\nThen, with missing your daughter's graduation, it's difficult to judge from this post how severe the situation was, and whether you could have made the graduation. I'm not going to pile on and say you absolutely should have gone without knowing the full story. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my wife alone with a child in a life or death situation, so I won't judge. That being said, there's no way that you should have made that promise to Kay, especially with no intention of keeping it. There were I'm sure other ways of salvaging things. And then having made that promise, you should have alerted Amy to the situation instead of blindsiding her so close to her graduation.\n\nAt this point, in your situation, I would probably go to Amy's graduation, since I'm assuming she sees you as her father. Not going would be punishing her for no good reason, and destroying another relationship. It's up to you to figure out how to fix things with Kay. She's going to see you as a liar, perhaps rightfully so, but hopefully you'll be able to show that you care about her regardless. I'd suggest maybe a trip with just the two of you, and maybe her brother as well if he's interested. She's definitely being spiteful here, but it's probably coming from a place of hurt.

I (54M) lost my first wife when my son (25M) and daughter (22F) were ages 9 and 12, Both my kids took it as hard as you would expect and to this day have a poor relationship with both my current wife \"Doreen (49F)\" and my stepdaughter \"Amy (18F)\". I started dating Doreen about 4 months after my first wife passed, as such my kids believe I cheated on their mom. Amy was 5 when we got together and as such I see her as my own daughter.\n\nOn to the actual story, 4 years ago, two days before Kay's high school graduation, Amy got very ill while visiting her grandparents and ended up needing emergency surgery. My wife and I rushed to be with Amy and admittedly I did not communicate well with Kay. At the time Kay didn't pick up my calls, so I left her a voicemail and several text messages explaining what happened and telling Kay I was sorry but I would make it up to her. A few hours go by and I get a call from Kay, she is in hysterics telling me what a terrible father I am and stated that if I did not attend her graduation I would be dead to her. I chose to support Amy.\n\nTrue to her words, Kay did not contact me on the day of her graduation. And when came home Kay's things had been moved out of the house with a note explaining that we were no longer family and to never contact her again.\n\nLuckily Kay and I were able to reconcile, however, I promised her I would give her absolutely anything in the world to make her forgive me. She said that she would forgive me as long as I refused to attend Amy's graduation as this was the only way to make it fair. I agreed at the time thinking she was just joking or angry and would soon forget. \n\nThis leads me to now. Invitations for Amy's graduation went out, and despite all the hostility Amy wanted to make sure Kay got one. Kay called Amy later that day and said she would be unable to attend as she and I would be spending the day together per our agreement. Amy broke down into tears asking me why I was missing her graduation, I assured her I was not and that I would speak to Kay. Later I explained to Kay that I simply could not miss Amy's graduation. Kay launched into a tirade about how I was a liar and an asshole and how could I do this to her again. I told her that we would talk when she calmed down and she said we would never talk again.\n\nMy son, and several of our extended family have all taken Kay's side saying I didn't see how hurt she was at graduation. My wife believes I am the asshole for even promising that in the first place as I should have known it would only upset one or both girls. And Amy is just sad and confused wondering why Kay hates her. I know keeping my promise and not attending Amy's graduation is probably the only way to salvage my relationship with Kay, but no matter how I look at it I would feel like I'm punishing Amy for having a medical issue, so am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her mom was present, and I assume her grandparents probably were too, so you didn't *have* to be there and leave your daughter alone.\n\nThird, given you already have fucked up with your daughter's graduation, you should've been upfront and explained why you couldn't go to Amy's graduation.  Your wife and stepdaughter were probably going to be upset, but you needed to own up to your prior fuck up, and prove to Kay that you can follow a promise and spend time with her now to make up for then.  \n\nAlthough, as for your wife calling you TA for making that promise, she's TA herself for dismissing why Kay asked you to make that promise.

She was a child and so many of the things she was dealing with were caused by you and your new wife. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve had an emergency appendectomy - you did not have to stay the extra two days, she was recovering not in any danger.

You started dating your wife\u2019s best friend four months after she passed? No wonder everyone thinks you cheated. No way you two weren\u2019t having at least an emotional affair prior to her death. \n\nYou\u2019ve seriously let your older children down horribly.

You pulled THE WORST MOVE. I don't know why widowed men can't seem to understand that you cannot replace your dead wife/children's mother WITH HER BEST FRIEND and expect it to be all good and copacetic. My dad did this shit 2 months after my mother died and I HATED him for it. Just because you needed to avoid your grief and decided to fill the emotional hole that was your dead wife, with her best friend (which is also sus looking af), doesn't mean your kids wanted her there to alleviate their grief. They wanted THEIR mom, not some lady that said she was their mom's friend and is now trying to be theirs because she wants to kiss their dad. You definitely need to learn to how to actually deal with things and not just worry about your own feelings and getting everything you want.

You already shown your two kids where they stand in your new family you are a terrible father first you moved on a way to soon then you choose your stepdaughter over your own daughter.

You definitely prioritize Amy above your daughter. \n\nI\u2019m curious, did you take your kids for counseling after their mother died. Did you take them to visit their mother\u2019s grave on her birthday and special holidays. Did you take into account how they would feel when you started dating after grieving for 4 months. Did you care more about your happiness than your kids wellbeing and emotional health. \n\nYou need to look towards the past to really understand why it was so important for you to attend R\u2019s graduation.

I'm guessing this is the result of you making her feel insignificant for basically her entire life, but she is being a huge asshole to her step sister for no good reason. It's not like her step sister decided to get emergency surgery on purpose and in all likelihood she probably didn't even ask you to be there for her, and if she did its still OK because she was still young and scared and wanted/needed her parents. I would expect more maturity from a 22 year old on this subject. Even if she is mad and hates you she shouldn't be putting her step sister in the cross fire. The real issue is between you and her, and she is the asshole for involving an innocent 3rd party.

Probably not, BUT you agreed to it. You need to be a man of your word and stick to your word for Kay or be prepared to miss more milestones in her life like walking her down the aisle, her kids, etc. Kay probably at this point feels like an orphan with no parents left while you play hero to her step sister.

Either you risk losing Kay forever (I'd bet good money that you will) or you hurt Amy's feelings. If you only look at the numbers, choosing to spend the day with Kay is the \"best\" choice, but that doesn't make it the right choice either.\n\nTbh you should have been looking into family therapy before you even started dating, and then doubled down after you did start dating Amy's mom.", "YTA \n\nWhat an asinine promise (that you had no intention of keeping).

You also should never have made such a promise to Kay to skip Amy's. Doing so only reinforced her false belief that this is somehow Amy's fault and only punishing her will make it fair.

Then four months later, you told them that they would see you sucking face with their Aunt Doreen. It does not matter if you did not \u201ctry\u201d to replace your first wife. To your kids\u2019 perception, you did exactly that for all intents and purposes whether you meant to do it or not. Your intention does not matter to them. Your actions did.\n\nYou say you offered them therapy, you gave them space, you never pushed them to open up if they didn\u2019t want to. I think the reality is that you actually ignored the complicated and raging feelings in Kay for YEARS hoping that she\u2019d just get over it so daddy could finally be able to play \u201cbig happy family\u201d without his moody daughter. By claiming to give her space and giving her control of how she grieved or how she opened up to her replacement mom, in actuality you allowed her resentment to fester because you did not feel like doing something difficult as a parent and father like having a tough conversation with your kids. And it\u2019s utterly despicable that you\u2019ve allowed it to spread to Kay and Amy\u2019s relationship with each other because you were too afraid to confront the uncomfortable situation that you created. You did not grant them independence, you abandoned them in a time with they needed an adult figure to help them sort out their feelings. It should not have been a therapist\u2019s duty to do that. \n\nYou want to make it seem like you\u2019re sacrificing so much by being a father to Amy. \u201cOh she\u2019s like my very own daughter.\u201d You already have a daughter. Her name is Kay. You want to be seen as a good person so bad that you\u2019re willing to highlight your relationship with Amy so that it overshadows your mistreatment of Kay. \u201cOh Amy had surgery and she wanted me there, I had to be a good stepfather and stay with her. I absolutely had to!\u201d No, you didn\u2019t. She requested that you be there along with her mother and her grandparents. You did not need to be there. You made a choice to be there. Don\u2019t you dare try and absolve yourself of your role in this by passing off the blame to your stepdaughter. Rather than having to face the possible disappointment that Amy would not be able to see you for at most one day, you decided to abandon Kay during a major milestone in her life that her brother and grandmother were able to attend, but that her father CHOSE not to attend. Your hands weren\u2019t tied. You were not stuck between a rock and a hard place. You made a conscious decision to not attend Kay\u2019s graduation. Her mother couldn\u2019t be there. You didn\u2019t want to be there. \n\nAnd then just when I thought the bad decisions couldn\u2019t get any worse, you agree to Kay\u2019s misguided attempt at karma by promising not to attend Amy\u2019s graduation. No, you did not think she was joking. Stop lying. You decided to ignore and hope that she would forget or change her mind; that she would get over it like when she lost her mother and you immediately started knocking boots with Doreen. Amy thinks that Kay hates her because of your choices. You caused that to happen.\n\nStop trying to absolve yourself of your role in all of this. This is no one\u2019s fault but your own. You caused all of this. Be an adult and start making amends with everyone. Do not try and ignore it and hope that everyone gets over it for a third time. Learn from your own mistakes.", "YTA - I really hope she cuts you out for good, for her own sake and mental health. Do you even like your daughter?", "YTA. There's way more to this story than you're willing to admit. Children don't go no contact with their parents for an isolated incident. You've clearly made Kay feel inferior enough times throughout her life that she's fed up with it. \n\nI also agree with your wife that your fatal mistake was to even agree with Kay's request in the first place, instead of putting in the effort to actually discuss the situation and *listen* to Kay and how she was feeling.\n\nYou're just a shit father all around. I wish Kay all the luck and happiness in the world.", "YTA for dating 4 months after your wife passed on. So you couldn't be a father and parent to your own kids but want a do over once Amy and her mother come into your life? Fucking useless person you are among other things.", "YTA. Stay away from Kay.

What an awful feeling for Kay", "YTA  you may not have slept with Doreen before your late wife died but you definately were having thoughts about it while your late wife was alive. I doubt no emotional affair took place.\n \nYTA for abandoning your daughter on an important day. She didn't have a single parent to attend. You also broke her promise to to attend Amy's graduation. You made a false promise. You are a really bad father. \nLet kay move on and stop trying to ruin her life. You just keep letting her down.", "YTA you are a lying liar who lies. And a shot excuse of a parent to your daughter.", "YTA. You left your child who had no other living bio parents to go through graduation ALLONE\u2026.\nYour step daughter would have been FINE with just her mother there. Instead you ditched your daughter who had to watch all her friends and classmates have people there, cheering for them, giving flowers and taking photos, and your child was alone. Hurt. And angry. \n\nNo wonder she wants to make not only you but her step sibling hurt like she was. \n\nThis is something you can never make up. \n\nNot only that but you are going to hurt your daughter or step daughter either way. And you wife won\u2019t be happy either. \nYou my dear are royally screwed without lube.", "YTA and a horrible father. You don't deserve a 3rd chance with your daughter.

Why would you promise a child some thing that you knew you would never have the intention of following through? What did you think would happen?", "YTA.

You could have gone back for the graduation and been back at Amy's bedside within 24 hours, but you stayed because Amy wanted you there, ignoring the daughter who needed you there. A few phone calls isn't going to cut it.\n\nFor making a promise to your daughter and then breaking it. It wouldn't be fair to punish Amy for a medical episode?

But most people are completely ignoring that i.e. the entire reason he posted asking for judgment because they are focused on the 4 months and nothing else.", "What did he lie about?", "4 months\u2026 wife\u2019s bestie\u2026 yeah, totally not suss in any way.", "[deleted]", "There is absolutely unhealthy and bad ways to grieve what are you talking about? Over eating is an unhealthy way to grieve, excess drinking and drugs or any hard drug use, disturbing your family dynamic in a volatile time, bringing a new person into your kids lives and house while they\u2019re still actively grieving, sleeping around recklessly, making impulsive major decisions like selling your house or throwing away all of a deceased persons things, adrenaline seeking by doing new dangerous things, being controlling to things or people because you feel out of control, gambling or excess spending/shopping, and many more examples.\n\nGetting into a new relationship too quickly, and especially doing so when you have kids, can be very unhealthy and problematic for everyone involved. It can cause distress, depression, anger, abandonment, anxiety, etc in the kids, it can cause an unhealthy dependence or obsession on the new partner due to using them as a crutch or distraction, it can cause the new partner to feel obligated, trapped, anxious, or even powerful/needed (which is also an unhealthy relationship dynamic).\n\nThis is grief 101. One of the most important parts of a loved one or professional helping someone during the grieving process is making sure they are coping and dealing with it in a healthy and safe way. No risk taking behavior, isolation, obsessing over the loss, drug or alcohol abuse, denial, over/under eating or self harm, controlling or obsessive behavior to people or things around them.\n\nThe step daughter didn\u2019t do anything wrong but the dad did, and while the daughters demand was unfair and punishing the wrong person if the dad was so against it he should\u2019ve put a stop to it the moment she said it, not a couple weeks before the graduation. The daughter would not have been put in the situation to make clear cut demands or boundaries if the father had made better choices from the start. The dad is the asshole here."]}
