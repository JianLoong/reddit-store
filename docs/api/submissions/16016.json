{"id": 16016, "submission_id": "1337f8h", "title": "AITA for breaking a promise and attending my stepdaughter's graduation?", "selftext": "I\u2019ll start by explaining some backstory. I (54M) lost my first wife when my son (25M) and daughter (22F) were ages 9 and 12, Both my kids took it as hard as you would expect and to this day have a poor relationship with both my current wife \"Doreen (49F)\" and my stepdaughter \"Amy (18F)\". I started dating Doreen about 4 months after my first wife passed, as such my kids believe I cheated on their mom. Amy was 5 when we got together and as such I see her as my own daughter.\n\nOn to the actual story, 4 years ago, two days before Kay's high school graduation, Amy got very ill while visiting her grandparents and ended up needing emergency surgery. My wife and I rushed to be with Amy and admittedly I did not communicate well with Kay. At the time Kay didn't pick up my calls, so I left her a voicemail and several text messages explaining what happened and telling Kay I was sorry but I would make it up to her. A few hours go by and I get a call from Kay, she is in hysterics telling me what a terrible father I am and stated that if I did not attend her graduation I would be dead to her. I chose to support Amy.\n\nTrue to her words, Kay did not contact me on the day of her graduation. And when came home Kay's things had been moved out of the house with a note explaining that we were no longer family and to never contact her again.\n\nLuckily Kay and I were able to reconcile, however, I promised her I would give her absolutely anything in the world to make her forgive me. She said that she would forgive me as long as I refused to attend Amy's graduation as this was the only way to make it fair. I agreed at the time thinking she was just joking or angry and would soon forget. \n\nThis leads me to now. Invitations for Amy's graduation went out, and despite all the hostility Amy wanted to make sure Kay got one. Kay called Amy later that day and said she would be unable to attend as she and I would be spending the day together per our agreement. Amy broke down into tears asking me why I was missing her graduation, I assured her I was not and that I would speak to Kay. Later I explained to Kay that I simply could not miss Amy's graduation. Kay launched into a tirade about how I was a liar and an asshole and how could I do this to her again. I told her that we would talk when she calmed down and she said we would never talk again.\n\nMy son, and several of our extended family have all taken Kay's side saying I didn't see how hurt she was at graduation. My wife believes I am the asshole for even promising that in the first place as I should have known it would only upset one or both girls. And Amy is just sad and confused wondering why Kay hates her. I know keeping my promise and not attending Amy's graduation is probably the only way to salvage my relationship with Kay, but no matter how I look at it I would feel like I'm punishing Amy for having a medical issue, so am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682804151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1337f8h/aita_for_breaking_a_promise_and_attending_my/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re clutching at straws here in the hope that someone will validate your poor parenting choices. \n\nShe moved out all those years ago - YOU\u2019RE ALREADY ON YOUR SECOND CHANCE.\n\nYou provide Amy with two parents all the time and you choose to leave Kay with no parents. Every time you choose Amy over Kay you orphan her.\n\nThe only way you get to keep three kids is to skip Amy\u2019s graduation as promised and you should have told Amy about this long, long ago. However, you being the poor excuse for a parent that you seem to be you thought that you\u2019d just blank this promise to the child whose graduation you skipped.\n\nIf you break it, you lose Kay and you\u2019ll likely lose your son too.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: and let\u2019s not even bother going down the new woman while your children are still grieving the loss of their mother route.

Now YTA for prioritizing the step daughter again. 5 months in a new relationship after your wife died was also probably another YTA moment not giving your kids enough time to grieve with your support- you created that poor family bond yourself. So yup YTA all the way around. Leave Kay alone she deserves better.", "YTA - you replaced your kids mom with a new family 4 months after she died!  Your kids lost their mom so young and you don\u2019t seem like you prioritized their feelings or helped them deal with things, instead you moved on fast. \n\nKay didn\u2019t have a mother to attend her graduation and she needed you there.  Could you not have driven to the grad then back to the hospital?", "YTA\n\nWas Amy in an unstable condition? Was she still critically ill? If she got ill 2 days prior to the graduation, and admitted that day, she should be feeling better after 2 days. And her BIOLOGICAL mom was there with her. \n\nWho was there for Kay? NOT YOU\n\nNow Amy's graduation is coming up, and that will probably be a day where Kay will remember how YOU let her down.\nIt sounds like the only way to somewhat save your relationship with Kay is to not attend Amy's graduation - and Amy will still have a parent there; her mom. That is still better than what Kay had.", ">I started dating Doreen about 4 months after my first wife passed, as such my kids believe I cheated on their mom.\n\nSo you don't deny it. Okay.\n\n>Amy got very ill while visiting her grandparents and ended up needing emergency surgery.

You consistently put your step daughter above Kay. You shouldn\u2019t have promised Kay that at all, you knew you would not keep the promise but gave it anyway! Why would you do that? It shows you don\u2019t value keeping your word to Kay. Also your step daughter is 18 show her this post so she understands its you that is the issue not her.

You definitely were!", "YTA\n\nAnd have been for years. You are a bad father. Kay is correct. You are a liar. You've done nothing to prioritize Kay ever since your new family rolled in. Your relationship with your daughter is dead and the blood is on your hands.", "YTA for making a promise that you're now going back on. What were you thinking? Say anything to get her to talk to you again? That's a bad thing and you likely just totally torpedoed your relationship with both your daughter and your son.\n\nStop saying things and making promises that are convenient in the present that you don't intend to honor in the future. It's probably too late for your older kids. But you should keep that in mind so you don't mess up your relationship with your current wife and stepdaughter.", "YTA. You shouldn't have promised something you weren't willing to follow through on. \n\nAlso, why wouldn't you go to Kay's graduation ceremony while Doreen was with Amy, then return to see Amy after the ceremony? \n\nIt does sound like you are choosing Amy over Kay, and you created this monster by starting to date so soon after your wife's death. \n\nYou aren't thinking about how your actions affect your kids.", "4 months later after your wife passed  ?

That\u2019s not normal or ok. Kay was old enough to take care of her basic needs, but you just abandoned her for 3+ days.

Your second AH moment was choosing to stay with your step daughter when she had her mother and grandparents with her, and leaving your own daughter without a parent at graduation, which was obviously very important to her. Your third AH moment was promising her you wouldn't go to your stepdaughter's graduation and then going anyway. You've shown her over and over that her feelings don't matter.

Both of my parents died relatively early and missed milestones, so I have a sense of what Kay is feeling.

Kay, who was already missing her mama at this event, felt abandoned and completely alone. This was 100% your fault due to your choice to prioritize Amy over Kay. Subsequently, you made a promise to Kay to try and get back in her life. It was ill-advised and perhaps even idiotic to say that you\u2019d not attend Amy\u2019s graduation. But dude, you did it and now you get to lie in the bed you made. The idea of Amy\u2019s feelings being hurt is too much of a burden for you to bear, but you seen to have completely ignored the great hurt you CHOSE to inflict on your actual daughter.

First, don\u2019t make promises you won\u2019t keep. Second, it wasn\u2019t a reasonable as k from Kay and you should have just said no from the start. That\u2019s probably more what Kay was looking for, tbh. It sounds like she just needed another reason to kick you out of her life for good. Instead of focusing on the graduation, look back at her entire childhood and try to be honest with yourself about every decision you made that hurt Kay and every time you prioritized your wife and Amy over her. This situation calls for brutal self-honesty and you need to be ready to take ownerships of your mistakes. She may still not want a relationship with you.

I usually don't judge people on for moving on quickly after a partner passes, but it's different when you have children who've lost a parent and are struggling. This is a situation where I believe they should have been prioritized until they got out of the worst stage of grief. 4 months is FAST in the context of losing a mom.\n\nThen, with missing your daughter's graduation, it's difficult to judge from this post how severe the situation was, and whether you could have made the graduation. I'm not going to pile on and say you absolutely should have gone without knowing the full story. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my wife alone with a child in a life or death situation, so I won't judge. That being said, there's no way that you should have made that promise to Kay, especially with no intention of keeping it. There were I'm sure other ways of salvaging things. And then having made that promise, you should have alerted Amy to the situation instead of blindsiding her so close to her graduation.\n\nAt this point, in your situation, I would probably go to Amy's graduation, since I'm assuming she sees you as her father. Not going would be punishing her for no good reason, and destroying another relationship. It's up to you to figure out how to fix things with Kay. She's going to see you as a liar, perhaps rightfully so, but hopefully you'll be able to show that you care about her regardless. I'd suggest maybe a trip with just the two of you, and maybe her brother as well if he's interested. She's definitely being spiteful here, but it's probably coming from a place of hurt.

I (54M) lost my first wife when my son (25M) and daughter (22F) were ages 9 and 12, Both my kids took it as hard as you would expect and to this day have a poor relationship with both my current wife \"Doreen (49F)\" and my stepdaughter \"Amy (18F)\". I started dating Doreen about 4 months after my first wife passed, as such my kids believe I cheated on their mom. Amy was 5 when we got together and as such I see her as my own daughter.\n\nOn to the actual story, 4 years ago, two days before Kay's high school graduation, Amy got very ill while visiting her grandparents and ended up needing emergency surgery. My wife and I rushed to be with Amy and admittedly I did not communicate well with Kay. At the time Kay didn't pick up my calls, so I left her a voicemail and several text messages explaining what happened and telling Kay I was sorry but I would make it up to her. A few hours go by and I get a call from Kay, she is in hysterics telling me what a terrible father I am and stated that if I did not attend her graduation I would be dead to her. I chose to support Amy.\n\nTrue to her words, Kay did not contact me on the day of her graduation. And when came home Kay's things had been moved out of the house with a note explaining that we were no longer family and to never contact her again.\n\nLuckily Kay and I were able to reconcile, however, I promised her I would give her absolutely anything in the world to make her forgive me. She said that she would forgive me as long as I refused to attend Amy's graduation as this was the only way to make it fair. I agreed at the time thinking she was just joking or angry and would soon forget. \n\nThis leads me to now. Invitations for Amy's graduation went out, and despite all the hostility Amy wanted to make sure Kay got one. Kay called Amy later that day and said she would be unable to attend as she and I would be spending the day together per our agreement. Amy broke down into tears asking me why I was missing her graduation, I assured her I was not and that I would speak to Kay. Later I explained to Kay that I simply could not miss Amy's graduation. Kay launched into a tirade about how I was a liar and an asshole and how could I do this to her again. I told her that we would talk when she calmed down and she said we would never talk again.\n\nMy son, and several of our extended family have all taken Kay's side saying I didn't see how hurt she was at graduation. My wife believes I am the asshole for even promising that in the first place as I should have known it would only upset one or both girls. And Amy is just sad and confused wondering why Kay hates her. I know keeping my promise and not attending Amy's graduation is probably the only way to salvage my relationship with Kay, but no matter how I look at it I would feel like I'm punishing Amy for having a medical issue, so am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her mom was present, and I assume her grandparents probably were too, so you didn't *have* to be there and leave your daughter alone.\n\nThird, given you already have fucked up with your daughter's graduation, you should've been upfront and explained why you couldn't go to Amy's graduation.  Your wife and stepdaughter were probably going to be upset, but you needed to own up to your prior fuck up, and prove to Kay that you can follow a promise and spend time with her now to make up for then.  \n\nAlthough, as for your wife calling you TA for making that promise, she's TA herself for dismissing why Kay asked you to make that promise.

She was a child and so many of the things she was dealing with were caused by you and your new wife. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve had an emergency appendectomy - you did not have to stay the extra two days, she was recovering not in any danger.

You started dating your wife\u2019s best friend four months after she passed? No wonder everyone thinks you cheated. No way you two weren\u2019t having at least an emotional affair prior to her death. \n\nYou\u2019ve seriously let your older children down horribly.

You pulled THE WORST MOVE. I don't know why widowed men can't seem to understand that you cannot replace your dead wife/children's mother WITH HER BEST FRIEND and expect it to be all good and copacetic. My dad did this shit 2 months after my mother died and I HATED him for it. Just because you needed to avoid your grief and decided to fill the emotional hole that was your dead wife, with her best friend (which is also sus looking af), doesn't mean your kids wanted her there to alleviate their grief. They wanted THEIR mom, not some lady that said she was their mom's friend and is now trying to be theirs because she wants to kiss their dad. You definitely need to learn to how to actually deal with things and not just worry about your own feelings and getting everything you want.

You already shown your two kids where they stand in your new family you are a terrible father first you moved on a way to soon then you choose your stepdaughter over your own daughter.

Yeah your an asshole millions times", "They weren't comfortable with her in the position in their lives that you decided to put her in.

You definitely prioritize Amy above your daughter. \n\nI\u2019m curious, did you take your kids for counseling after their mother died. Did you take them to visit their mother\u2019s grave on her birthday and special holidays. Did you take into account how they would feel when you started dating after grieving for 4 months. Did you care more about your happiness than your kids wellbeing and emotional health. \n\nYou need to look towards the past to really understand why it was so important for you to attend R\u2019s graduation.

And you wonder why Kay hates Amy? Amy knew it was Kay\u2019s graduation but she still chose to tell you to stay at her bedside? She isn\u2019t as innocent as you think she is. I guarantee she asked you to stay because she wanted you to miss the graduation and now she\u2019s playing victim. I bet she\u2019s constantly rubbed it in Kay\u2019s face how you love her more Kay.
