The eldest David is addicted to cocaine. He started using when he went to uni and left after one year because of it. Despite us doing everything we can David continues to be addicted. He is 36 years old. He has spent 9 of the past 18 years of addiction in prison. Not all at once but over several different periods. All due to drug use or trying to get money to pay for it. Unfortunately David has been able to get drugs even when he is in prison and even being there is not enough to have him sober. He has been into inpatient and outpatient rehab several times too. Both on the NHS and private.\n\nMy mum and dad want to stage an intervention for David. Both me and Stephen live near mum and dad. My mum told me Stephen said he wouldn't be coming to the intervention. He said it is \"a waste of time\" and that David is a \"lost cause\" and a \"selfish bastard\". I was shocked when I heard this. I understand David has done things because of his addiction, but addiction is a disease and David isn't choosing to be an addict. Stephen thinks this intervention won't work because the ones we have done in the past will not.\n\nDavid's addiction has also been hard on my parents. Mum is 57 years old and dad is 61. Dad wants to retire in the next few years but I know their finances are affected by Harry's legal fees, fines and rehab costs. Our grandparents are in their 80s now and they live in Tynemouth so there is no one else, we have no other family. My mum said their Vicar and his wife agreed to come to David's intervention but Stephen is not coming. He says he is moving all to Sunderland (we live in Bristol) and wants nothing to do with David ever again.\n\nWhen I heard about this from mum I was shocked. I told Stephen he is the horrible one not David and I told him he is abandoning our family when David needs him the most. David needs our help and our compassion. I am just angry at Stephen but I realize I may have been too hard on him and I could have convinced him to be there without losing my temper. I will accept it if I am told I am wrong for what I said. Am I the asshole for how I spoke to Stephen and what I said to him?", "created_utc": 1676924250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117jb6o/aita_for_saying_my_brother_abandoned_our_family/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see why you might feel abandoned, one brother has checked out on your family through his addiction, the other is moving away. But really, that is what happens, people grow up, move away, and might reduce contact as a result. \n\nBut from your own words, Stephen wants nothing to do with David (or is it Harry?) - this does not mean Stephen wants nothing to do with you, or your parents, and it doesn't mean he is abandoning the family as a whole, it simply means that Stephen is cutting contact from your drug addicted, criminal brother. \n\nIn calling Stephen worse that David, you've added more bricks to the wall that was being built Stephen and you & the other members of your family.", "YTA\n\nYour brother isn't entitled to anything from anyone.

Every family member has their own breaking point, and you can\u2019t force them into supporting the addict or attending an intervention. If the rest of the family feels inclined, that\u2019s great. But you have to respect the other brothers boundaries of not joining in.\n\nI should mention, I know how you feel. Ive been in the position of trying to coax family into being supportive of my brother, and I\u2019ve been on the opposite end - saying I\u2019m done w it.

If you\u2019ve tried in the past to help David with no luck it may be healthy to take Stephen\u2019s approach by cutting him out. You can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t actually want help.

The best thing you can do for your brother is allow him to hit his own rock bottom. There is a reason addiction is the lonely mans disease as no one can or should be around active addicts who steal and cause harm to others. \n\n\nDapl Uk do a program for friends and  family of addicts it will open your eyes to the role you are playing in his addiction and how to handle his addiction better. \nYou also owe your brother an apology, you should all follow his lead as addicts will destroy everyone in their cahos of addiction.

Yes, but people have proven over and over again that we can do hard things in order to better our lives.", "YTA \n\nStephen is allowed to cut ties and disengage from a toxic family member, if you want to play rescuer with David then have it but he\u2019s not obligated to", "YTA.

Stephen does not owe you or David anything. And being more angry at the innocent brother is quite icky.", "YTA -  Stephen's choice is Stephen's choice. Having watched his eldest brother destroy himself for years I'm sure there is a component of this which has traumatized your brother and made his life difficult. Stephen probably needs a great deal of help to deal with his issues resulting from David's addiction...", "Yes, YTA. Stephen has made his decision about his relationship with his brother. Good on him for protecting himself.", "YTA- Stephen doesn\u2019t owe it to david to be there in any shape or form. addiction is difficult, absolutely. But no one should have to just take the actions that someone with addictions dishes out with no recourse. \n\nStephen is doing what is best for him. You absolutely cannot fault him for that.", "YTA\n\nStephen doesn't owe David anything. While addiction is a battle, it is hell for those around him.  18 years is a lot of hell and David isn't entitled to Stephen's forgiveness.\n\n\nConsidering it has been 18, I am beginning to wonder if you and your family are enabling David. David has to want to get better and he has to do it for himself. You can't do it for David.", "YTA \n\n>I understand David has done things because of his addiction, but addiction is a disease and David isn't choosing to be an addict.\n\nDavid might not necessarily have chosen to be an addict, but he doesn't sound like he's choosing to get better either. The family can only do so much for him. In Stephen's case, he has reached the point where he has no more energy to give in regards to David. He is not horrible for walking away. If you love Stephen as much as you love David, you'll respect his choice. \n\nLook. My oldest sister is an addict. She's been clean for years now, but she screwed up badly and burnt a lot of bridges before she finally got sober. It was hard for her. And it was hard for the family to watch her relapse and go to prison multiple times. I know from personal experience that sometimes you got to walk away for your own wellbeing.", "Does David want to get clean?\n\nYou can't fix people. You can help them fix themselves, but you can't do it for them.\n\nIn Stephen's case, it seems as though there's some significant history between him and David. You don't say what this is, but it wouldn't be unusual if David had repeatedly stolen from Stephen, and quite possibly stolen things of significant emotional value, or in other ways taken significant advantage of him.\n\nYou seem to be completely dismissing Stephen's feelings about this. Yeah, David's an addict. That motivates his crimes and whatever else he has inflicted on Stephen, but it doesn't mean that those things didn't happen. The harm that David has done to Stephen, and the feelings that Stephen has about it, are real. They don't go away just because David is an addict.\n\nYTA", "yta. after 18 years what he gonna discover in this intervention? that drugs are bad? no surprises there, you brother is totally in his rights to move on and quit these enabling the cycle of additon of your brother, i'm sure these is not the first intervention a very much doubt it will be the last, you are a awful for accusin your brother of leaving the family behind, he has the right to find happyness away from the addict cycle.", "A gentle YTA. Addiction is a family disease, and Al-Anon is a great tool to help you navigate that.", "Soft YTA - Look, I've been in very similar shoes as you - sibling addict, jail, ruining parent's finances, etc. And after many, many times beating my head against the wall with discussions and attempted interventions, I realized I was doing more work than the addict themselves. And I had zero boundaries, letting it almost consume me with worry.\n\nYou're affected by the dynamics addiction has had on your family, to the point you could possibly even be an enabler. It sounds like your other brother has figured out his boundaries, even if he expressed them in a way you find offensive. Look into how addiction affects families and reflect on your own part.", "YTA - I understand that addiction is tough but there is no requirement that a parent or sibling attempt to support another person perpetually.  The sad fact is that a lot of people in David's case may end of dead and while you obviously don't want this to happen Stephen is protecting himself and others near him from being hurt and traumatized further.  \n\nYou have already said that your parents are struggling financially because of David and will you take up the responsibility for David if your parent's pass away?  Will you accept David into your house if you have a family?  It is unlikely because you aren't really being burdened by David yet.", "YTA.  You are a textbook case of co-dependency.\n\nYes,  David has a serious medical condition.  Yes, he deserves compassion and good medical care.\n\nNo,  an 'intervention' will not work.   Obviously.    David will not get better unless David makes that choice.\n\nSteven is not responsible for David.   Steven is responsible for Steven.      David has been a trainwreck for his \\*entire adult life\\* and has spent more than half of it in prison.   This means Steven has only known a trainwreck, abusive criminal since childhood.\n\nYour insistence on Steven being somehow an asshole for creating a healthy, grown up boundary shows that this is not about helping Steven at all.  This is about your martyr complex.       You should talk to someone about this because people like you are why Al-Anon was invented.\n\n(Edited to fix name swap)", "Soft YTA - \n\nI'm all about having compassion on addicts, but you cannot decide when someone else has given enough of themself and their compassion to David. Everyone has a limit. Stephen has reached his. \n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to Stephen. It's an emotional time and you were under a lot of stress, so hopefully he understands. Keep him lightly informed on your brother's status, but do not push it. He might come around again. Addicts have a way of tearing everybody's world apart around them. Stephen just might need some time to heal from that. Don't cause your family further harm by putting this on his shoulders. Have some compassion for both brothers.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nYour brother is a lost cause, and he will sink your whole family. Your other brother is saving himself, because he sees what is coming. Good for him.\n\nFor what it's worth, one thing to consider is that very few junkies ever get clean and stay clean if they keep living in the same place. The success rate is much higher if they leave. They need to remove themselves from temptation, which usually requires total detachment from everyone and everywhere they know. Otherwise, they just fall back in to the same cycle, because it's easy. I would suggest, if your parents plan to retire anyway, that they move, and take junkie bro with them. It might be what makes it stick this time. Assuming your brother wants to get clean that is.", "YTA - Stephen has decided to cut his losses and bow out. Seems like he's the wise one.\n\nAnd, who is 'Harry'?", "YTA. Your brother is a realist, knows you have tried all this before and failed. \n\nYou would be better off getting your parents to STOP funding David, enabling him and hurting themselves.  Only if David hits rock bottom will he be likely to change.", "YTA, but I understand why you reacted that way.  However, everyone around the addict gets to decide when to disengage to save their own mental health and it sounds like Stephen has reached that point.  \n\nYou should do some reading on addict family dynamics and codependent behavior.  It sounds like you are more angry at Stephen than you are concerned that David is causing all of these problems for your entire family, which is a bit misplaced.  Part of a standard intervention is a bottom line - Go to rehab immediately or X about your life will change.  That's usually, no more money, no housing, no legal help, no contact unless it's to go to treatment.", "YTA. It's been 18 years. Your brother is tired and does not want to deal with it. He doesn't want to be nurned anymore after all this time. Your brother's addiction has ruined your family, and yet you all act like your brother is the bad guy because he wants to move away and be done with this cycle.\n\nYes, addiction is a disease, but your brother is not blameless. In the end, Stephen does not want to keep enabling his brother and have to pick up after him when your parents die.", "> I told Stephen he is the horrible one\n\nI'm sorry, this is someone *you're* asking for a favor?  YTA, and look up what \"abandon\" means", "YTA you don't get to decide when someone is done and Stephen is done it sounds like for good reason. Yes David needs help for his issues but he has been given it countless times and thumbed his nose at it all. At some point people are done and addicts (or whatever their issue is) have burned their bridges. You were out of line for lashing out and saying that to Stephen. Who has done nothing wrong and is protecting himself from an addict brother who doesn't care about anyone or himself. You've had multiple interventions? Okay. Why didn't they work and how will this one be any different?", "YTA. An addict won't get help until they're ready. The truth is, sometimes you have to take a few steps back and let the chips fall where they will, it sucks. Your parents deserve financial security and peace, so does your brother.", "YTA. At this point David has made his bed. If he wants to lie, steal, and ruin your parents that\u2019s not Steve\u2019s cross to carry. You should be taking your anger out on David. He is the cause of all your problems and now that Steve is over it he\u2019s the bad guy? I didn\u2019t read the part where Steve fucked everyone over multiple times. Respect his choice and you should probably follow his footsteps.", "Soft YTA because you're in a hard an horrible situation.\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot save someone that doesn't want to be saved from addiction. Considering this has been going in through several interventions I cannot fault your brother for setting a boundary. It is actually necessary to keep yourself sane and healthy. \n\nAlso, yes, addiction is a disease and being addicted and on the hunt for your drug will severely skew your perspective of what is acceptable to do to other people. It doesn't make it okay though. I understand there comes a point for everyone, where enough is just enough.\n\nMaybe look up codependency and find help and support, for your parents rather than the addicted brother that doesn't seem in a place to acceptor want  help at the moment. Maybe even get therapy for them/the lot of you. I'm sure your other brother would actually be on board and supportive with that.", "YTA  Stephen has reached the level of trauma he can take and you've added to that.  To an extent he's right, an intervention is a waste of time.  You can't help David until David wants to help himself.  While he's unwilling to do the work to change you're just going to keep getting hurt.  I'm not saying turn your back, just let him hit rock bottom and be there for him when he truly is ready to change his life.  Having a loved one that's a drug addict or alcoholic is horrific.  Wanting them to be sober, you'd try and do anything for them, including hurting others and yourself.  At some point you have to stop and make them take accountability otherwise it destroys you as well as them.", "YTA, coming from a family where I\u2019m a Stephen with his own David for a brother so I might be biased. Yes, his addiction is a disease and he\u2019s certainly suffering from it, but we\u2019re not martyrs. We don\u2019t have to suffer just because they do, I won\u2019t pretend to know your family so I\u2019ll tell you about mine. My David convinced my dad to co-sign a mortgage with him, got addicted to heroin and then fucked off to who knows where for years with his wife and kids before my sister in law divorced him and moved back to our area. Obviously my dad couldn\u2019t afford two mortgages, so my dad got a foreclosure on the nearly perfect credit score he\u2019d spend decades building. Sounds like you\u2019re not American so you might not know, but that\u2019s a brutal hit. Not that I know how things work where you\u2019re from, but I can\u2019t assume it\u2019s much better. Since his ex wife and kids moved back, he\u2019s seen his kids maybe 5 times in the last 8 years, if that. \n\nMy parents have taken him to and paid for rehab at least 6 times that I know of, probably more. Every single time he leaves the program early. I can only come to two possible conclusions: right now he is either unwilling or unable to overcome it, regardless of how much help he receives. Until he can, he\u2019s going to keep sinking further and further, no matter who tries to help him. Maybe even dragging them with him. So yeah, until he gives me damn good reason to believe otherwise, I\u2019ve effectively given up on him. My family knows not to bother giving me updates about him, and I don\u2019t ask. \n\nSo yeah, YTA for berating Stephen for putting himself first this time. What\u2019s the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.", "YTA. Steven sounds like the smartest out of the whole lot of you. He believes David to be a lost cause. I don\u2019t know him, but from what is written here, he\u2019s probably right. He does not owe his time to David, nor any other lost causes. \n\nIf you were a bit smarter, you\u2019d consider a different intervention. One for your parents to stop banging their head against a wall and bailing out someone who doesn\u2019t deserve their money.", "Al-Anon might be helpful to you and your parents. It's helped a lot of people whose family members are addicted, and not just to alcohol.", "NAH\n\nAddiction is one of those situations where I hardly judge anyone's reaction to it or anyone else feelings toward that person as well. Addition is crippling to everyone and I don't blame Stephen about cutting contact to David either. Your reaction to Stephens position on your brother is valid because personally I would never give up on a family member.", "ESH.  \n\n1.

The eldest David is addicted to cocaine. He started using when he went to uni and left after one year because of it. Despite us doing everything we can David continues to be addicted. He is 36 years old. He has spent 9 of the past 18 years of addiction in prison. Not all at once but over several different periods. All due to drug use or trying to get money to pay for it. Unfortunately David has been able to get drugs even when he is in prison and even being there is not enough to have him sober. He has been into inpatient and outpatient rehab several times too. Both on the NHS and private.\nMy mum and dad want to stage an intervention for David. Both me and Stephen live near mum and dad. My mum told me Stephen said he wouldn't be coming to the intervention. He said it is \"a waste of time\" and that David is a \"lost cause\" and a \"selfish bastard\". I was shocked when I heard this. I understand David has done things because of his addiction, but addiction is a disease and David isn't choosing to be an addict. Stephen thinks this intervention won't work because the ones we have done in the past will not.\nDavid's addiction has also been hard on my parents. Mum is 57 years old and dad is 61. Dad wants to retire in the next few years but I know their finances are affected by Harry's legal fees, fines and rehab costs. Our grandparents are in their 80s now and they live in Tynemouth so there is no one else, we have no other family. My mum said their Vicar and his wife agreed to come to David's intervention but Stephen is not coming. He says he is moving all to Sunderland (we live in Bristol) and wants nothing to do with David ever again.\nWhen I heard about this from mum I was shocked. I told Stephen he is the horrible one not David and I told him he is abandoning our family when David needs him the most. David needs our help and our compassion. I am just angry at Stephen but I realize I may have been too hard on him and I could have convinced him to be there without losing my temper. I will accept it if I am told I am wrong for what I said. Am I the asshole for how I spoke to Stephen and what I said to him?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Stephen has had enough trying to help his brother\u2026his brother who doesn\u2019t want to get help! You can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want it! These are David\u2019s choices, he is choosing to be an addict! His family has tried and helped him for the past what, 18 years!, and he *chooses* to continue doing drugs! \n\nDavid is the selfish and horrible brother who has abandoned his family, not Stephen! You\u2019re family could have a million interventions and it won\u2019t do a damn thing for David. HE needs to make the decision that he wants to quit and get help, you and your family can\u2019t do it for him! All you can do right now is NOT enable him by condoning it or giving him money, and let him know you\u2019re there to support him if and when he\u2019s ready to actually change. HE needs to hit his rock bottom. He may or not not ever get to that point. \n\nI think your angry at Stephen because you know he\u2019s right. Your anger should be directed at David for all that he\u2019s done and put your family though. Having another intervention isn\u2019t going to do shit, and it definitely does not make Stephen a horrible person for not coming when it is useless", "Soft YTA.

Everyone copes on different ways, and for him, setting boundaries might be his way of dealing in a healthy way.", "YTA\n\nStephen seems to be the only person that realizes that helping your eldest brother is an exercise in futility. He has had half of his life to fix his troubles, with help from his family, and he has made no progress because he doesn't want to progress. He doesn't want to get better. He's going to drag all of your family down with his sinking ship, and Stephen is the only one that decided to cut that lifeline.\n\nTake a look at brother again, realize that he is done with this absolute farce, and then apologize for what you said.", "Who is Harry? This isn't William is it?", "YTA.", "INFO: Has David given you any impression of wanting to get sober recently? If not, Stephen is correct that this intervention will fail too.\n\nIn any case, this isn't Stephen's problem. Really, it's David's problem, because David is the only one who can fix it. If David isn't willing to put in the work to fix his addiction, you're wasting your time, and your parents are doing worse than wasting their time by enabling him.", "Lol YTA. You can\u2019t drown saving other people", "YTA  having grown up with an alcoholic I can tell you that you had no right to speak to Stephen like that. David's addiction probably destroyed his childhood and its hard to stay patient with someone who just keeps taking and taking and only cares for themselves. Stephen is right, you can rehab, intervention, etc but until David decides to change he'll just keep destroying everyone around him. Leave your poor brother alone after you apologize to him.", "Yta. And I want to tell you to stfu. Stephen went to one intervention already, it didnt work. He doesnt want to do it anymore. Leave him along you asshole", "YTA. David has been to rehab. David has been to prison. He knows how he has hurt everyone around him already. An intervention is not going to make him do anything differently. The best you will get out of him is an agreement to let your parents throw more money at him while he pretends to take what you are saying seriously, but continuing doing drugs.\n\nYou need to face reality: Your and your parents are enablers. You are allowing him to continue his habit by all the support you are giving him. Your brother is never going to get clean for you or your parents. He is too far into addiction for that. He will take absolutely everything from you to feed his habit. He will lie, cheat, steal and worse to keep taking drugs until there is absolutely nothing left to beg, borrow or steal to get drugs.\n\nStephen is the only one doing the right thing here. You need to cut David off completely. When he finally realizes you are serious and says he's changed and wants to go to rehab, don't believe him. Make him work for it himself.

First and foremost, addiction may now be classified a disease however David chooses to be an addict.  No one put a gun to his head the very first time he chose to use drugs.  It was a choice he chose to make.  From there it went down hill.  Second, you state in your post that he\u2019s done things that he shouldn\u2019t have.  There are consequences for such actions.  Third, when there\u2019s someone in the family who has mental issues it will inevitably effect all members of that family in some way or another.

Hmmm, don't hate to say this, but at this point, you HAVE to ask yourself, does David EVER intend to SUCCESSFULLY complete a rehab stint? IMO, with all of the rehabs, not once has he CHOSEN to get clean. An Addict can ONLY get clean if they are WILLING to do the hard work and stay clean.

I've known people that have got disowned from their parents for less, because they were considered an embarrassment and brought \"shame to their family\".\n\nWe had to disown my Uncle, because his \"habits\" put my grandma in physical danger with loan sharks. That was the wake up call that scared everyone in my dads family to disown him completely.

Maybe the cocaine was what helped him to unlock the ability to think things that no sane person in the history of our entire species ever thought.", "It definitely makes more sense than many other theories I\u2019ve seen posed, lol!", "YTA\n\nDavid has to help himself. You need to accept your help/intervention is not going to work if he doesn\u2019t want it. Stephen can see that and can see you\u2019re all wasting your time and lives. I don\u2019t blame him for choosing to move and not get involved in your madness. \n\nYou anger is misplaced, it should be at David. He\u2019s ruining his own life and dragging you all down. Stephen is the only one seeing sense and refusing to waste his life. You owe him an apology.", "YTA\n\nTwo things can be true at once: Addiction is a disease, but David also needs to take responsibility for his addiction. You are the soft hearted one and you want to do everything and anything you can for your brother and I understand that, Stephen is the opposite and when it comes to matters of addiction, that's OK. David has to want to get better and right now he doesn't and if you want to pour yourself into someone that isn't ready to pour into themselves that's on you, but Stephen doesn't have to. \n\nAddiction causes you to do a lot of damage in your family and David has done that. David has got to do the work and get back anywhere close to your brother wanting to speak to him again and you can't fix that and it's not your job.", "YTA and you and your parents are enabling this behavior. Check yourselves in an Al-Anon or similar group because you\u2019ve got to get a grip. Stephen owes you or his brother nothing.", "YTA\n\nDavid isn't entitled to Stephen's help and nor are you. David is fragmenting your family and you still continue to stoke his pyre with your body. You need to accept that Stephen has given all hope and wishes to remove himself from the environment that is causing him pain.\n\nAnd honestly, I personally think what Stephen is doing is more beneficial than what you are doing. The key to getting out of an addiction is *wanting* to get out. What reason does *David* have to push himself out of his addiction? None. He gets *shelter, food and clothing*. The only thing he doesn't get is cocaine which he seems to be happily acquiring himself. He literally has no reason to want to treat his addiction, he would gain nothing except having to work and pay his own taxes so for him, its in his best interest to remain addicted.", "As a person in recovery, Stephen is the only sane person in this story. As an adult the addict is responsible for getting help. Not the people around him. In fact tough love would dictate doing this intervention and then letting go of David. He is doing it to himself, and doesn't want to quit. You live in Britain, I know there is help in Britain for addiction. He chooses not to do it. Every person with an addiction has to face that truth, and put down the drugs and alcohol....Everyone. 20 plus years for me. No one was helping me at the end.

If you want to help David, you are free to, just as Stephen is free not to.", "Have you ever joined a support group for family members of people with addictions? I'm sorry to say this, but I think that is needed most of all. \n\nHere is another harsh thing that you need to hear.  Some people say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. You said you have had interventions before. Why do you think this time will be different? \n\nMaybe having people cut him off will be the best thing for David. It might get through when nothing else has. If you go this route, you will need your own support group even more. \n\nSoft YTA for what you said. I know this is incredibly hard for you, no matter what you decide.", "YTA. You have no idea what pain David has caused Stephen. There might be things you don't know. Stephen has watched the pain and stress everyone in his family has gone through because of David. He doesn't want to be apart of that pain anymore. You have no right to judge him. He has every right to feel the way he does and for his mental health has decided to stop. Just stop helping someone in his eyes doesn't care about the damage and pain he's caused others through his actions. \n\nYou have to respect his decision.", "tough situation, I'm sorry your Stephen does not want to be apart of the intervention.  Maybe he thinks tough love is best, because helping in the past did not work.  I hope Harry is able to overcome this disease.", "YTA - David's addiction is not Stephens problem he doesn't owe you or the family anything if he doesn't want to be part of it.

Until David is ready and willing to quit, all the interventions in the world will not work. Your anger is misplaced and you feel safer venting at Stephen rather than acknowledging the harm David has done and will continue to do to himself and your family.

Family comes before everything else.", "I can understand both sides but I side with you Stephan was wrong to say that but if he doesn't want a part in this then that's fine but shouldn't have worded it like that I have seen a drug addict be rehabilitated he's in the wrong here", "YTA. Stephen is correct; the intervention will be a waste of time and money.\n\nThe way an intervention works is that the addict is threatened with a serious consequence if they don\u2019t check into rehab. David has suffered the consequence of incarceration which hasn\u2019t stopped his drug use. \n\nEven if there was a chance that intervention would work, David\u2019s addiction and recovery aren\u2019t Stephen\u2019s responsibility.", "YTA. \nAddiction is a disease, but that doesnt mean anyone has to help get your brother better. \nIt's like saying that you *have to* make chicken soup for stephen when he has the flu.

It's a nice thing to do, but it isnt an obligation, especially when there are negative feelings and emotional/mental hurt (which is often the case with addiction).", "YTA. Sorry to say this but David sounds like a complete lost cause. He has spent half his life as an addict, I promise you an intervention won\u2019t even go though David\u2019s head. Stephen knows that.

May I suggest moving abroad for rehab. The lack of network , the fact that it's more expensive here ,the fact that it's not common practice here ...all these factors helped . \nI still get urges if I hear someone has it ... Making it hard to get has been the biggest help.\nThere are boot camps and rehabs all over the world , I realise they can't cost but .. they are worth looking into. U can also just move to a country..plz avoid Holland, everything(drugs) is too cheap there.\n\nIf he dosnt see it as a problem he won't fix it . If u constantly attack him and make him feel small about it he will dig his heels in deeper. \n\nYTA because u can't force anyone to put themselves through this experience, it's mentally taxing and u should be able to quit if u can't do it anymore. It's not fair ofc but we all have our individual right to a private life with private goals.", "YTA. I say this as the daughter of addicts/alcoholics, granddaughter of alcoholics and niece of alcoholics. While the chemical dependency may be a disease, using substances is a choice. Every time David was in rehab and decided to leave/use was a choice. Every time David decided to continue using in prison was a choice. Every time he stole/committed a crime to support his habit was a choice. \n\nI have had my things stolen by family members. I have seen them get sober and then decide to use instead of getting the help they\u2019ve sought before to get sober. Addiction is a disease but also a lot of choice made to feed the disease. \n\nStephen is tired of being on the merry go round. You\u2019ve tried time and again having interventions and sending David to treatment and it hasn\u2019t worked. Do you know why? Have you and your parents actually sat down to discuss why those attempts haven\u2019t been successful? I\u2019m being serious not sarcastic. \n\nI think it\u2019s because you and your parents haven\u2019t actually followed through with any repercussions given during any of the prior interventions. Typically during an intervention you tell the addict how much you love them and care for them but also how their addiction has impacted you and your relationship and you life negatively without holding back and you also explain how moving forward your relationship will change with actual consequences for the addict\u2019s actions. I have a feeling you and your parents are not following through with the last part.\n\nDavid needs to lose people and support as an addict in order to hit his rock bottom. He needs to feel the true consequences of his actions. Not just going to prison but not having anyone to pay any legal fees or anyone to call or a place to lay his head down when he\u2019s run through his other options. He needs to feel the pain and the weight of his addiction. He won\u2019t feel the true loss of his life if he never loses it. \n\nYou and your family have to offer support if and only if he is to be sober. No one night on the couch. No meals. No money for a hotel room that he won\u2019t use for a hotel room. If David calls and the first words from his mouth are not \u201cI\u2019m ready to go to rehab\u201d then you hang up. You cannot help an addict get sober by ALWAYS supporting them. \n\nStephen is tired of doing the same thing and expecting a different result. He is tired of putting himself in a vulnerable place and being hurt time and again. It\u2019s his right to give up on David because David has proven he cannot be counted on to change. Stephen is making peace and moving on with his life. It\u2019s his right to do so. It\u2019s unhealthy and emotionally draining to continue dealing with an addict. Every time you do this you put your life on hold and hold your breath waiting to see if this time will be different. \n\nYTA because you\u2019re assuming that Stephen doesn\u2019t care. He does but he\u2019s also entitled to move on. If David does ever get sober, Stephen is still entitled to not want a relationship with him. \n\nYou and your parents need to speak to a specialist/therapist who deals with families of addicts. By not being firm with David your are doing him no favors. I say this again as someone who comes from a family full of addicts. You cannot help David if he doesn\u2019t want to help himself. And you cannot help him if you are willing to enable him no matter what. And that is what you and you parents are doing-enabling him.\n\nI do hope you and everyone in your family get the help that you need. Truly. But this does not begin with David\u2019s intervention; it ends with it until he decides to get sober.", "YTA. Stephen is not incorrect. He does not owe David anything, and he has a right to his opinions about David's behaviour. He is protecting himself from what is, ultimately, a futile exercise. David is the only one who can change himself, and so far he has shown no inclination to do so. David is fully aware of how his actions hurt others and he does not care. Yes, addiction is a disease, but it's one that the victim has some agency over. David could choose better, and he doesn't. What will this intervention achieve? David gets scolded, and your parents continue to bleed money that should be going to their retirement?", "NTA. While it's understandable that he's tired as shit of your bro, he doesn't have to disparage him and you for hoping that this time he will change, especially if it really is true that he's a selfish bastard (tbh, pretty likely if he does coke) because you all know it.\n\nYou cannot control how other people behave or make you feel, but you can control your actions in regards to them. He's allowed his brother to make him into a less supporting, lesser brother, which tbh is letting him win. The right move is still to keep your arms open and hope that he will actually grow and improve.\n\nOn the other hand, are you helping David or are you enabling him? At what point are interventions just a \"waste of time\" as Stephen says? Can you see that maybe it\u00b4s the frustration and hurt that David has inflicted on him speaking? You may be a bit harsh to the brother who is still there and does care about your family, because if he didn't care, he wouldn't have gotten hurt by Davids actions.", "They are all enablers.", "[removed]", "Honestly even if David did become clean that long period of use is gonna mean he isn't going to be the same david he was before the drugs", "OP is free to help David but he can't just go off at someone who isn't willing to.
