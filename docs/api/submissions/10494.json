The eldest David is addicted to cocaine. He started using when he went to uni and left after one year because of it. Despite us doing everything we can David continues to be addicted. He is 36 years old. He has spent 9 of the past 18 years of addiction in prison. Not all at once but over several different periods. All due to drug use or trying to get money to pay for it. Unfortunately David has been able to get drugs even when he is in prison and even being there is not enough to have him sober. He has been into inpatient and outpatient rehab several times too. Both on the NHS and private.\n\nMy mum and dad want to stage an intervention for David. Both me and Stephen live near mum and dad. My mum told me Stephen said he wouldn't be coming to the intervention. He said it is \"a waste of time\" and that David is a \"lost cause\" and a \"selfish bastard\". I was shocked when I heard this. I understand David has done things because of his addiction, but addiction is a disease and David isn't choosing to be an addict. Stephen thinks this intervention won't work because the ones we have done in the past will not.\n\nDavid's addiction has also been hard on my parents. Mum is 57 years old and dad is 61. Dad wants to retire in the next few years but I know their finances are affected by Harry's legal fees, fines and rehab costs. Our grandparents are in their 80s now and they live in Tynemouth so there is no one else, we have no other family. My mum said their Vicar and his wife agreed to come to David's intervention but Stephen is not coming. He says he is moving all to Sunderland (we live in Bristol) and wants nothing to do with David ever again.\n\nWhen I heard about this from mum I was shocked. I told Stephen he is the horrible one not David and I told him he is abandoning our family when David needs him the most. David needs our help and our compassion. I am just angry at Stephen but I realize I may have been too hard on him and I could have convinced him to be there without losing my temper. I will accept it if I am told I am wrong for what I said. Am I the asshole for how I spoke to Stephen and what I said to him?", "created_utc": 1676924250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117jb6o/aita_for_saying_my_brother_abandoned_our_family/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see why you might feel abandoned, one brother has checked out on your family through his addiction, the other is moving away. But really, that is what happens, people grow up, move away, and might reduce contact as a result. \n\nBut from your own words, Stephen wants nothing to do with David (or is it Harry?) - this does not mean Stephen wants nothing to do with you, or your parents, and it doesn't mean he is abandoning the family as a whole, it simply means that Stephen is cutting contact from your drug addicted, criminal brother. \n\nIn calling Stephen worse that David, you've added more bricks to the wall that was being built Stephen and you & the other members of your family.", "YTA\n\nYour brother isn't entitled to anything from anyone.

Every family member has their own breaking point, and you can\u2019t force them into supporting the addict or attending an intervention. If the rest of the family feels inclined, that\u2019s great. But you have to respect the other brothers boundaries of not joining in.\n\nI should mention, I know how you feel. Ive been in the position of trying to coax family into being supportive of my brother, and I\u2019ve been on the opposite end - saying I\u2019m done w it.

If you\u2019ve tried in the past to help David with no luck it may be healthy to take Stephen\u2019s approach by cutting him out. You can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t actually want help.

The best thing you can do for your brother is allow him to hit his own rock bottom. There is a reason addiction is the lonely mans disease as no one can or should be around active addicts who steal and cause harm to others. \n\n\nDapl Uk do a program for friends and  family of addicts it will open your eyes to the role you are playing in his addiction and how to handle his addiction better. \nYou also owe your brother an apology, you should all follow his lead as addicts will destroy everyone in their cahos of addiction.

Yes, but people have proven over and over again that we can do hard things in order to better our lives.", "YTA \n\nStephen is allowed to cut ties and disengage from a toxic family member, if you want to play rescuer with David then have it but he\u2019s not obligated to", "YTA.

Stephen does not owe you or David anything. And being more angry at the innocent brother is quite icky.", "YTA -  Stephen's choice is Stephen's choice. Having watched his eldest brother destroy himself for years I'm sure there is a component of this which has traumatized your brother and made his life difficult. Stephen probably needs a great deal of help to deal with his issues resulting from David's addiction...", "Yes, YTA. Stephen has made his decision about his relationship with his brother. Good on him for protecting himself.", "YTA- Stephen doesn\u2019t owe it to david to be there in any shape or form. addiction is difficult, absolutely. But no one should have to just take the actions that someone with addictions dishes out with no recourse. \n\nStephen is doing what is best for him. You absolutely cannot fault him for that.", "YTA\n\nStephen doesn't owe David anything. While addiction is a battle, it is hell for those around him.  18 years is a lot of hell and David isn't entitled to Stephen's forgiveness.\n\n\nConsidering it has been 18, I am beginning to wonder if you and your family are enabling David. David has to want to get better and he has to do it for himself. You can't do it for David.", "YTA \n\n>I understand David has done things because of his addiction, but addiction is a disease and David isn't choosing to be an addict.\n\nDavid might necessarily have chosen to be an addict, but he doesn't sound like he's choosing to get better either. The family can only do so much for him. In Stephen's case, he has reached the point where he has no more energy to give in regards to David. He is not horrible for walking away. If you love Stephen as much as you love David, you'll respect his choice. \n\nLook. My oldest sister is an addict. She's been clean for years now, but she screwed up badly and burnt a lot of bridges before she finally got sober. It was hard for her. And it was hard for the family to watch her relapse and go to prison multiple times. I know from personal experience that sometimes you got to walk away for your own wellbeing.", "Does David want to get clean?\n\nYou can't fix people. You can help them fix themselves, but you can't do it for them.\n\nIn Stephen's case, it seems as though there's some significant history between him and David. You don't say what this is, but it wouldn't be unusual if David had repeatedly stolen from Stephen, and quite possibly stolen things of significant emotional value, or in other ways taken significant advantage of him.\n\nYou seem to be completely dismissing Stephen's feelings about this. Yeah, David's an addict. That motivates his crimes and whatever else he has inflicted on Stephen, but it doesn't mean that those things didn't happen. The harm that David has done to Stephen, and the feelings that Stephen has about it, are real. They don't go away just because David is an addict.\n\nYTA", "yta. after 18 years what he gonna discover in this intervention? that drugs are bad? no surprises there, you brother is totally in his rights to move on and quit these enabling the cycle of additon of your brother, i'm sure these is not the first intervention a very much doubt it will be the last, you are a awful for accusin your brother of leaving the family behind, he has the right to find happyness away from the addict cycle.", "A gentle YTA. Addiction is a family disease, and Al-Anon is a great tool to help you navigate that.", "Soft YTA - Look, I've been in very similar shoes as you - sibling addict, jail, ruining parent's finances, etc. And after many, many times beating my head against the wall with discussions and attempted interventions, I realized I was doing more work than the addict themselves. And I had zero boundaries, letting it almost consume me with worry.\n\nYou're affected by the dynamics addiction has had on your family, to the point you could possibly even be an enabler. It sounds like your other brother has figured out his boundaries, even if he expressed them in a way you find offensive. Look into how addiction affects families and reflect on your own part.", "YTA - I understand that addiction is tough but there is no requirement that a parent or sibling attempt to support another person perpetually.  The sad fact is that a lot of people in David's case may end of dead and while you obviously don't want this to happen Stephen is protecting himself and others near him from being hurt and traumatized further.  \n\nYou have already said that your parents are struggling financially because of David and will you take up the responsibility for David if your parent's pass away?  Will you accept David into your house if you have a family?  It is unlikely because you aren't really being burdened by David yet.", "YTA.  You are a textbook case of co-dependency.\n\nYes,  David has a serious medical condition.  Yes, he deserves compassion and good medical care.\n\nNo,  an 'intervention' will not work.   Obviously.    David will not get better unless David makes that choice.\n\nSteven is not responsible for David.   Steven is responsible for Steven.      David has been a trainwreck for his \\*entire adult life\\* and has spent more than half of it in prison.   This means Steven has only known a trainwreck, abusive criminal since childhood.\n\nYour insistence on Steven being somehow an asshole for creating a healthy, grown up boundary shows that this is not about helping Steven at all.  This is about your martyr complex.       You should talk to someone about this because people like you are why Al-Anon was invented.\n\n(Edited to fix name swap)", "Soft YTA - \n\nI'm all about having compassion on addicts, but you cannot decide when someone else has given enough of themself and their compassion to David. Everyone has a limit. Stephen has reached his. \n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to Stephen. It's an emotional time and you were under a lot of stress, so hopefully he understands. Keep him lightly informed on your brother's status, but do not push it. He might come around again. Addicts have a way of tearing everybody's world apart around them. Stephen just might need some time to heal from that. Don't cause your family further harm by putting this on his shoulders. Have some compassion for both brothers.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nYour brother is a lost cause, and he will sink your whole family. Your other brother is saving himself, because he sees what is coming. Good for him.\n\nFor what it's worth, one thing to consider is that very few junkies ever get clean and stay clean if they keep living in the same place. The success rate is much higher if they leave. They need to remove themselves from temptation, which usually requires total detachment from everyone and everywhere they know. Otherwise, they just fall back in to the same cycle, because it's easy. I would suggest, if your parents plan to retire anyway, that they move, and take junkie bro with them. It might be what makes it stick this time. Assuming your brother wants to get clean that is.", "YTA - Stephen has decided to cut his losses and bow out. Seems like he's the wise one.\n\nAnd, who is 'Harry'?", "YTA. Your brother is a realist, knows you have tried all this before and failed. \n\nYou would be better off getting your parents to STOP funding David, enabling him and hurting themselves.  Only if David hits rock bottom will he be likely to change.", "YTA, but I understand why you reacted that way.  However, everyone around the addict gets to decide when to disengage to save their own mental health and it sounds like Stephen has reached that point.  \n\nYou should do some reading on addict family dynamics and codependent behavior.  It sounds like you are more angry at Stephen than you are concerned that David is causing all of these problems for your entire family, which is a bit misplaced.  Part of a standard intervention is a bottom line - Go to rehab immediately or X about your life will change.  That's usually, no more money, no housing, no legal help, no contact unless it's to go to treatment.", "YTA. It's been 18 years. Your brother is tired and does not want to deal with it. He doesn't want to be nurned anymore after all this time. Your brother's addiction has ruined your family, and yet you all act like your brother is the bad guy because he wants to move away and be done with this cycle.\n\nYes, addiction is a disease, but your brother is not blameless. In the end, Stephen does not want to keep enabling his brother and have to pick up after him when your parents die.", "> I told Stephen he is the horrible one\n\nI'm sorry, this is someone *you're* asking for a favor?  YTA, and look up what \"abandon\" means", "YTA you don't get to decide when someone is done and Stephen is done it sounds like for good reason. Yes David needs help for his issues but he has been given it countless times and thumbed his nose at it all. At some point people are done and addicts (or whatever their issue is) have burned their bridges. You were out of line for lashing out and saying that to Stephen. Who has done nothing wrong and is protecting himself from an addict brother who doesn't care about anyone or himself. You've had multiple interventions? Okay. Why didn't they work and how will this one be any different?", "YTA. An addict won't get help until they're ready. The truth is, sometimes you have to take a few steps back and let the chips fall where they will, it sucks. Your parents deserve financial security and peace, so does your brother.", "YTA. At this point David has made his bed. If he wants to lie, steal, and ruin your parents that\u2019s not Steve\u2019s cross to carry. You should be taking your anger out on David. He is the cause of all your problems and now that Steve is over it he\u2019s the bad guy? I didn\u2019t read the part where Steve fucked everyone over multiple times. Respect his choice and you should probably follow his footsteps.", "Soft YTA because you're in a hard an horrible situation.\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot save someone that doesn't want to be saved from addiction. Considering this has been going in through several interventions I cannot fault your brother for setting a boundary. It is actually necessary to keep yourself sane and healthy. \n\nAlso, yes, addiction is a disease and being addicted and on the hunt for your drug will severely skew your perspective of what is acceptable to do to other people. It doesn't make it okay though. I understand there comes a point for everyone, where enough is just enough.\n\nMaybe look up codependency and find help and support, for your parents rather than the addicted brother that doesn't seem in a place to acceptor want  help at the moment. Maybe even get therapy for them/the lot of you. I'm sure your other brother would actually be on board and supportive with that.", "YTA  Stephen has reached the level of trauma he can take and you've added to that.  To an extent he's right, an intervention is a waste of time.  You can't help David until David wants to help himself.  While he's unwilling to do the work to change you're just going to keep getting hurt.  I'm not saying turn your back, just let him hit rock bottom and be there for him when he truly is ready to change his life.  Having a loved one that's a drug addict or alcoholic is horrific.  Wanting them to be sober, you'd try and do anything for them, including hurting others and yourself.  At some point you have to stop and make them take accountability otherwise it destroys you as well as them.", "YTA, coming from a family where I\u2019m a Stephen with his own David for a brother so I might be biased. Yes, his addiction is a disease and he\u2019s certainly suffering from it, but we\u2019re not martyrs. We don\u2019t have to suffer just because they do, I won\u2019t pretend to know your family so I\u2019ll tell you about mine. My David convinced my dad to co-sign a mortgage with him, got addicted to heroin and then fucked off to who knows where for years with his wife and kids before my sister in law divorced him and moved back to our area. Obviously my dad couldn\u2019t afford two mortgages, so my dad got a foreclosure on the nearly perfect credit score he\u2019d spend decades building. Sounds like you\u2019re not American so you might not know, but that\u2019s a brutal hit. Not that I know how things work where you\u2019re from, but I can\u2019t assume it\u2019s much better. Since his ex wife and kids moved back, he\u2019s seen his kids maybe 5 times in the last 8 years, if that. \n\nMy parents have taken him to and paid for rehab at least 6 times that I know of, probably more. Every single time he leaves the program early. I can only come to two possible conclusions: right now he is either unwilling or unable to overcome it, regardless of how much help he receives. Until he can, he\u2019s going to keep sinking further and further, no matter who tries to help him. Maybe even dragging them with him. So yeah, until he gives me damn good reason to believe otherwise, I\u2019ve effectively given up on him. My family knows not to bother giving me updates about him, and I don\u2019t ask. \n\nSo yeah, YTA for berating Stephen for putting himself first this time. What\u2019s the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.", "YTA. Steven sounds like the smartest out of the whole lot of you. He believes David to be a lost cause. I don\u2019t know him, but from what is written here, he\u2019s probably right. He does not owe his time to David, nor any other lost causes. \n\nIf you were a bit smarter, you\u2019d consider a different intervention. One for your parents to stop banging their head against a wall and bailing out someone who doesn\u2019t deserve their money.", "Al-Anon might be helpful to you and your parents. It's helped a lot of people whose family members are addicted, and not just to alcohol.", "NAH\n\nAddiction is one of those situations where I hardly judge anyone's reaction to it or anyone else feelings toward that person as well. Addition is crippling to everyone and I don't blame Stephen about cutting contact to David either. Your reaction to Stephens position on your brother is valid because personally I would never give up on a family member.", "ESH.  \n\n1.

The eldest David is addicted to cocaine. He started using when he went to uni and left after one year because of it. Despite us doing everything we can David continues to be addicted. He is 36 years old. He has spent 9 of the past 18 years of addiction in prison. Not all at once but over several different periods. All due to drug use or trying to get money to pay for it. Unfortunately David has been able to get drugs even when he is in prison and even being there is not enough to have him sober. He has been into inpatient and outpatient rehab several times too. Both on the NHS and private.\nMy mum and dad want to stage an intervention for David. Both me and Stephen live near mum and dad. My mum told me Stephen said he wouldn't be coming to the intervention. He said it is \"a waste of time\" and that David is a \"lost cause\" and a \"selfish bastard\". I was shocked when I heard this. I understand David has done things because of his addiction, but addiction is a disease and David isn't choosing to be an addict. Stephen thinks this intervention won't work because the ones we have done in the past will not.\nDavid's addiction has also been hard on my parents. Mum is 57 years old and dad is 61. Dad wants to retire in the next few years but I know their finances are affected by Harry's legal fees, fines and rehab costs. Our grandparents are in their 80s now and they live in Tynemouth so there is no one else, we have no other family. My mum said their Vicar and his wife agreed to come to David's intervention but Stephen is not coming. He says he is moving all to Sunderland (we live in Bristol) and wants nothing to do with David ever again.\nWhen I heard about this from mum I was shocked. I told Stephen he is the horrible one not David and I told him he is abandoning our family when David needs him the most. David needs our help and our compassion. I am just angry at Stephen but I realize I may have been too hard on him and I could have convinced him to be there without losing my temper. I will accept it if I am told I am wrong for what I said. Am I the asshole for how I spoke to Stephen and what I said to him?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Stephen has had enough trying to help his brother\u2026his brother who doesn\u2019t want to get help! You can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want it! These are David\u2019s choices, he is choosing to be an addict! His family has tried and helped him for the past what, 18 years!, and he *chooses* to continue doing drugs! \n\nDavid is the selfish and horrible brother who has abandoned his family, not Stephen! You\u2019re family could have a million interventions and it won\u2019t do a damn thing for David. HE needs to make the decision that he wants to quit and get help, you and your family can\u2019t do it for him! All you can do right now is NOT enable him by condoning it or giving him money, and let him know you\u2019re there to support him if and when he\u2019s ready to actually change. HE needs to hit his rock bottom. He may or not not ever get to that point. \n\nI think your angry at Stephen because you know he\u2019s right. Your anger should be directed at David for all that he\u2019s done and put your family though. Having another intervention isn\u2019t going to do shit, and it definitely does not make Stephen a horrible person for not coming when it is useless", "Soft YTA.

Everyone copes on different ways, and for him, setting boundaries might be his way of dealing in a healthy way.", "YTA\n\nStephen seems to be the only person that realizes that helping your eldest brother is an exercise in futility. He has had half of his life to fix his troubles, with help from his family, and he has made no progress because he doesn't want to progress. He doesn't want to get better. He's going to drag all of your family down with his sinking ship, and Stephen is the only one that decided to cut that lifeline.\n\nTake a look at brother again, realize that he is done with this absolute farce, and then apologize for what you said.", "Who is Harry? This isn't William is it?", "YTA.", "INFO: Has David given you any impression of wanting to get sober recently? If not, Stephen is correct that this intervention will fail too.\n\nIn any case, this isn't Stephen's problem. Really, it's David's problem, because David is the only one who can fix it. If David isn't willing to put in the work to fix his addiction, you're wasting your time, and your parents are doing worse than wasting their time by enabling him.", "Lol YTA. You can\u2019t drown saving other people", "YTA  having grown up with an alcoholic I can tell you that you had no right to speak to Stephen like that. David's addiction probably destroyed his childhood and its hard to stay patient with someone who just keeps taking and taking and only cares for themselves. Stephen is right, you can rehab, intervention, etc but until David decides to change he'll just keep destroying everyone around him. Leave your poor brother alone after you apologize to him.", "Yta. And I want to tell you to stfu. Stephen went to one intervention already, it didnt work. He doesnt want to do it anymore. Leave him along you asshole", "YTA. David has been to rehab. David has been to prison. He knows how he has hurt everyone around him already. An intervention is not going to make him do anything differently. The best you will get out of him is an agreement to let your parents throw more money at him while he pretends to take what you are saying seriously, but continuing doing drugs.\n\nYou need to face reality: Your and your parents are enablers. You are allowing him to continue his habit by all the support you are giving him. Your brother is never going to get clean for you or your parents. He is too far into addiction for that. He will take absolutely everything from you to feed his habit. He will lie, cheat, steal and worse to keep taking drugs until there is absolutely nothing left to beg, borrow or steal to get drugs.\n\nStephen is the only one doing the right thing here. You need to cut David off completely. When he finally realizes you are serious and says he's changed and wants to go to rehab, don't believe him. Make him work for it himself.

First and foremost, addiction may now be classified a disease however David chooses to be an addict.  No one put a gun to his head the very first time he chose to use drugs.  It was a choice he chose to make.  From there it went down hill.  Second, you state in your post that he\u2019s done things that he shouldn\u2019t have.  There are consequences for such actions.  Third, when there\u2019s someone in the family who has mental issues it will inevitably effect all members of that family in some way or another.

You have no right to judge him for wanting to live his own life and no longer deal with David. \n\nIt sounds like Stephen has done his part in past interventions and has tried to help. He has likely been screwed over by David more times to count. I have two addicts in my immediate family. At some point, they are too much to deal with. All they do is harm their friends and family. All o have to show from my attemps to help them is stolen money and valuables, broken promises, and disappointment. Stephen doesn't owe David, or you, or the parents any further effort to try to save someone who appears to not want to be saved.\n\nIf you and your parents still have the patience and energy to keep trying to help, God bless you. But Stephen reached his limit, and you need to respect that.", "Addiction sucks & addicts destroy their family systems. Your brother is done. That's good for him. He's reached the end of his patience. He's taking care of himself. Do not guilt trip him. He will go low contact with you. He may go no contact if you keep trying to rope him into the intervention you're planning. You may lose 2 brothers.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nFamily guilt won\u2019t undo a problem that nine years in prison won\u2019t fix. \n\nStephen is a realist, while you think the combined powers of love and guilt can kick a debilitating addiction. \n\nUntil David is ready to fix his shit, no one can help him. \n\nA get together at your parent\u2019s place won\u2019t change that.", "Coming from an addict, YTA.", "I\u2019m an addict and YTA. \n\nYou asked Stephen and he said no. All that means is that his threshold is different than yours. \n\nLook, it\u2019s a fine line between being supportive and getting run over. Between setting no boundaries, too many boundaries, and healthy boundaries. \n\nStephen is dealing with the situation the best he can, just like you are. Have the intervention without him and don\u2019t hold it against him. Apologize and move on. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA. \n\nI may be the outlier here. But I am the firm belief addiction is not a disease. It\u2019s a habit, which can lead to a chemical dependency. But I digress. \n\nHarry/David is shit. It is what it is. And Stephen doesn\u2019t owe anyone nothing. \nI have plenty of these situations in my own family, and at a certain point\u2026 they are a lost cause.", "YTA. If Stephen is done with David, that\u2019s his prerogative. Addiction impacts everyone differently. I commend you for being so understanding of David, know I\u2019d urge you to extend that same compassion to Stephen as well.", "YTA - you were a huge AH to the brother that isn\u2019t ruining your family.", "YTA- Just because you choose to stay doesn\u2019t mean Stephen has too, that\u2019s a you problem. Stephen just reach his maximum capacity to handle David\u2019s poor choices and behaviour. At some point everyone has to understand you can not help or change those who don\u2019t want to help themselves, until David chooses to change nothing you do will work.  I wish Stephen the best in the future.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to decide how your brother reacts to David and his actions.", "YTA. Addiction is a choice, not a disease. I have an incurable disease and don't compare us.", "YTA. I\u2019m a former alcoholic and people certainly abandoned me. A couple of people still refuse to have any contact with me despite being sober almost 2.5 years. People are allowed to have boundaries. When someone hurts others so much, it is healthy to set a no contact boundary. Even during an intervention. \n\nStephen has been so hurt by David\u2019s actions (and we can assume D has stolen from S), that he is no longer willing to be a part of it. Interventions are mentally draining and can leave people damaged for years if the addict doesn\u2019t accept help, or drops out and goes right back to using. Stephen doesn\u2019t want to feel that hurt anymore and has every right to reject any thing to do with David.", "YTA. Stephen doesn't owe anyone anything because of David's addiction. As the sister of an addict who has tried everything, there is a point where there is no reason to be involved. I gave up a long time ago and I certainly wouldn't go to any intervention for her. People have boundaries and it is okay and doesn't make them horrible. David will not stop until he wants to no matter what you do. Your parents need to stop paying for David's bad decisions.", "It\u2019s really difficult to have an addict family member, especially if they refuse to get help or keep falling back into the mess over and over again. It\u2019s not just a matter of finances, it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI have a sibling with many issues. I tried to help. We all did. It was too much, having to call around to hospitals, chase them around the city, getting messages at all hours of the night and worrying whether the next phone call was going to tell me my sibling was dead. They ran away from treatment so many times. They stole. They lied. They are abusive and unhinged. After I had a nervous breakdown, I had to distance myself. I had to protect myself.\n\nI cannot fault anyone for giving up on a sibling who doesn\u2019t want to change. I think help should be given, but it has to be taken\u2026and you have to know when to stop carrying their bad choices on your back.\n\nYou should apologize to Stephen and let him be. David has had many, many years of help and chances and does not want to get better. Stephen doesn\u2019t need to put himself through the pain of trying to help someone who doesn\u2019t want to be helped.\n\nYTA for not respecting Stephen here.", "What everyone else is saying. It\u2019s hard to see a family member struggle with addiction but most addicts will continue until they genuinely, truly believe they need to change. All the love and good intentions of the world won\u2019t change this. As such, a healthy outlook is \u201cIl here to give you anything you need in the service of helping you beat the addiction you no longer want to be a slave to, but YOU need to do the work and tell me what help you need. \n\nThere\u2019s a cynical saying I\u2019ve see become reality too many times- the rescuer becomes the victim. \n\nYour brother may be a selfish asshole who is unfair to your addicted brother, OR he might be emotionally exhausted from the rollercoaster ride and NEEDS to check out for his own mental health. \n\nAddicts are famous for taking advantage of the kindness they are offered by their loved ones; I\u2019ve seen addicts literally bankrupt their parents and shorten their lives and health. \n\nYou each need to do what you want/need to do, but your brother is not wrong in prioritizing his own mental health over a decades long battle with his brother\u2019s addiction.", "YTA It\u2019s been 18 years and you don\u2019t get to dictate when a family member is done supporting someone\u2019s addiction. I\u2019m glad you still have compassion but everyone has different limits. I\u2019ve seen so many addicts in and out of treatment until their family and friends finally burn those bridges. I watch them change from so cocky because they think their family will never let them down. To suddenly sober when they are completely cut off. When they are completely cut off is the only time I hear them say \u201cI need to find a way to get clean.\u201d You\u2019re right it is the addiction that that makes them this way but that addiction shouldn\u2019t be allowed to ruin the whole family. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re family is going through this.", "NTA. You are a good brother and son but you spoke out of frustration and anger. You were wrong but your heart being in the right place is what is paramount here. What else is worthy of complete sacrifice and effort if not your own blood? Don\u2019t rationalize turning away from your family because the rest of the world will be all too glad to do it when someone gives them a reason to. Apologize to your brother and continue to fight the good fight. Good luck and take care.", "Sorry OP but David has lived half his life as an addict. His entire adult life. Your family doesn\u2019t need an intervention; they need 12 step therapy to accept the situation. David may have to hit rock bottom. \n\nNAH", "Exactly. I\u2019m in the process of doing the same as Stephen, moving in part to get away from my brother\u2019s meth addiction and family\u2019s enabling.

In the meantime, Stephen\u2019s gotta look out for number one; no one else is.", "I understand that getting hooked on at 18 can be put to \"bad choices\" of a young person. However he is 36 now, very very much a adult. If he isn't actually seeking help for himself there is very little a intervention like this would help.\n\nI can't blame Stephen, because if OP's parents are struggling then I can only imagine the things Stephen had to endure or sacrifice, because of David. It sounds like a lot of frustration and resentment has built up over the years and I can't blame him for it.\n\nYes, addiction is a disease but it's not a excuse or a \"free-pass\"  for all the wrong and pain he has caused. it doesn't magically erase things or fix things.\n\nYou talk about being compassionate to David but you seem to be lacking compassion for your other brother? It's obvious that it's more self-preservation, why should he give more of himself and sacrifice more of himself?\n\nI think after 18 years of sacrifice, you should of been more graceful and showed him compassion and support in his decision to walk-away, because as easy as it sounds. Walking away from a family member in need is not always easy, and takes a lot of determination and strength.

My life is so much calmer.", "You essentially told Stephen that he was worse than all of the collective pain your brother has caused over the years, including the pain that Stephen himself felt, watching your other brother become someone else.
