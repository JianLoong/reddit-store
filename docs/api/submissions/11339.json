If you're okay with that, then keep on doing what you're doing, as long as you understand that it might hurt you professionally.  \n  \nAnd I'm not saying you have to be on call 24/7 - It's important to have reasonable boundaries - but a tiny bit of flexibility can really go a long way.  Let's say you finish work at 5: if you spend 5 minutes checking your emails when you get home from work before settling down to start your evening, then that can make a huge difference. If an email can't be responded to in once sentence, you could respond with \"I'll take a look at this first thing tomorrow\".  It would go a long way.  \n \nThis is reddit though, so all the antiwork crowd are going to downvote me to hell.  I don't think what I'm suggesting is unreasonable.
