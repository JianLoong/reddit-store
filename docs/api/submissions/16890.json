I don't have any idea what I did but she'd always treat me like dirt, always finding some new personal jab at me or screaming at me over minor things. The worst was when she was in charge of scheduling. Most of the time she'd give hours to people she liked while the rest of us would get the bare minimum, and when I mentioned I would like to pick up some more hours, she went off on me, and complained to our general manager (who turned a blind eye to her because she reminded him of his late daughter). I finally found a job in my field and quit the bookstore ASAP. I'm doing much better now, I really like my job and I'm on track to get a promotion soon.\n\nThe other day I was at the mall, and I saw Ashlee at a distance in the parking lot.

Revenge is best served with a cold shoulder. This person made your work environment toxic and you don't owe her any more of your time.", "NTA! Ashlee was merely a coworker, not a friend, not even an aquaintance, she made your life miserable, you owe her absolutely nothing. So what you didn't let her catch up with you. You're allowed to not want someone in your life. NTA. What goes around comes around. If Ashlee were a better person, she wouldn't evoke such responses from folks.", "NTA.\nI have a lot of anxiety around seeing people I went to school with as I was treated poorly. Holding grudges is part of the problem and I think you can acknowledge someone without having to pretend to be nice for the sake of being polite. However, I think this was a minor interaction that will be of little significance for her. People don\u2019t move on overnight and you dealt with it how you felt fit. I\u2019m future you may move on or not but you felt hurt and behaves accordingly. In my opinion you pretending not to know her was better than causing a scene or directly ruining her day.", "NTA. We all have the right to avoid toxic people.", "NTA - and that \"someone else\" needs therapy.", "Asshole? Nah, but pretty pointless. I mean, really, what did it accomplish?\n\nIt probably took you longer to stand there and deny you knew her than to say, \u201ccan\u2019t talk\u201d and bounce or just turn and leave. And if someone else you work with \u201ccaught wind of it,\u201d at some point so will Ashlee. My guess is she already realizes it was you and you looked like a weirdo to her, but if for some reason she actually fell for your bit, she\u2019ll hear about it later and probably won\u2019t think your behavior reflects on her at all. Seems like a lot of effort.", "You can be polite and acknowledge that you knew her without her getting into your life.  Just seems odd to play like you don't know her instead of just being polite for 30 seconds and then moving on.
