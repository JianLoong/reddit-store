Your brother doesn't take this seriously. He doesn't have a hunting or firearm license. Hunting is dangerous and I assume you don't want to be out there with someone who wants to skirt the rules and potentially doesn't know what they are doing. So there's a legal issue and potential safety issues.", "You get to decide for whom you accept responsibility.   Your brother can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t try to, decide that you are responsible for him while he is breaking the law. \n\nWhether or not your brother helped care for your father doesn\u2019t matter, so don\u2019t mention it when discussing this IRL. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Many states including the one I live in require a license to hunt even on your own land with only a few exceptions. Game wardens in my state have vast powers and can even come onto private property if they hear shooting and think hunting is going on. Your land and your rules but depending your jurisdiction it could actually be illegal for him to hunt without a license.", "NTA I would suggest putting up several no trespassing signs so if he were to sneak on to hunt and get hurt you kinda have a CYA.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to hunt, he needs to start with the basics.  Hunters Safety course and a license just to start.  \n\nThe last thing anyone needs is the game warden showing up", "NTA obviously your brother thinks the rules don't apply to him.

Decided to take LandLORD to the next level huh?", "ESH- I was totally in your favor until you just got to the point where you said...\"I don't want my brother out there with me\".   So really, the excuses about the tags and the license are irrelevant- as you could provide those as requirments, that once met- \"you just really don't want him out there\"  So that's the real issue. You got the land and the guns and you don't want your brother there.  Unless there's more context that fully justifies that, you don't get a pass.  \n\nYour brother sucks because he's trying to skate appropriate laws and regulations, and expects to be provided for in regards to gear.", "Hunter education courses are required for hunting licenses (including bow hunting) in every state I've lived in, although some states waive the course for members of the military.", "I\u2019m currently holding them as my brother doesn\u2019t have the proper licences to carry a firearm. There is a stipulation in the will that if he gets his licence with in one year I am to give him his guns. I fully intend to do that .

Not so much with my brother .\nHe maybe hunted twice with us in the last 15 years . He\u2019s never made an effort to maintain trails or take care of the property that was left to me to do.

I think this is the answer- you roadmap it for him clearly as to what is required and then stick to your guns (see what I did there?). \n\nSo what if he got his licensing THIS season?", "Correct , he could shoot if he is under my direct supervision and a single firearm is used between us . The problem arises that he wants his own firearm which if caught I could lose not only that firearm but my own licence and firearms.", "Dude you do know hunting without a license is illegal right?", "If he had his firearms licence it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.

As a fellow ethical hunter, I understand where you're coming from.  I hate hunters that don't take the sport seriously and make no effort to be proficient with their weapon.  The worst of these are archery hunters who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn but won't hesitate to fling an arrow at an animal they'll likely seriously wound, but not kill.  The types who can't be bothered looking more than 200 yards for the animal they just shot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou probably have a lot of fond memories with your dad and the ethics and skills of hunting he instilled in you, whereas your brother sounds like the type to roll out of bed at 9am and walk through the middle of a field without a care for interrupting the hunting of others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that being said, think of how your father would want you to handle this situation.  Yes, your brother is a grown man.  Yes he's been briefed on the requirement to own a firearm.  I'm assuming you're in Canada and not the US due to your comments on a firearms license.  So why don't you go the extra mile and help your brother get his firearm license so he can inherit those heirlooms.  Maybe this is an opportunity for you and your brother to form a relationship over something your father clearly enjoyed.  Maybe this is the very reason your brother wants to hunt all of a sudden - to honor your dad and deal with the grief of losing a parent.

Plus the class teaches more than people think.", "NTA this sounds like the plot of a telenovela for your brother to pull a Dick Cheney and get your property. Like no recent gun experience. No license for the guns. No hunting license, you still need those on private property. And you are just opening yourself up to a wrongful death on your property. For which you would be liable.", "NTA. where i live you could get in serious trouble for letting him hunt on your property. that\u2019s on top of the legal trouble he could get in himself. not to mention the added danger of him not having proper qualifications.", "NTA. Don't let this guy hunt on your property. You have knowledge that he isn't taking reasonable care. If he hurts someone they would come after you. Might not win but that won't make it any fun.", "*Plus you could be liable for letting him hunt without a license should something happen.*\n\nI was wondering about this.

Here in Canada you need 2 courses to hunt with a fire arm , then another for owning a hand gun or restricted firearm . My brother took the test years ago and just never filed his paperwork which pissed myself and my father off", "Game Wardens will wreck your day even in the US with our gun culture.
