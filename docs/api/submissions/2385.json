Brother sounds highly likely to hurt someone or himself with his high excitement low knowledge approach.", "NTA.  Not really sure why you\u2019re doubting yourself, to be honest.  If he wants to hunt, he can get his damn license and convince you he\u2019s not going to land you in trouble when he inevitably does something stupid out of carelessness and/or lack of preparation.", "NTA. This sounds like an firearms accident waiting to happen.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s not registered, he\u2019s out of practice, doesn\u2019t have his own bow.

Nostalgia and regret and all. It would be kind of you to help him get his license and walk him through getting tags and such for next season so he can. \n\nI understand it's not your responsibility and it's too late for this season anyway, but a little understanding and empathy could probably get everyone happy with your decision. \n\nAgain: NTA. He is not a safe or legal hunter at the moment so theres no way you should let him hunt this weekend, period, the risks for everyone do NOT outweigh your brothers feelings.", "NTA - He cannot take possession of the firearms without a license. He cannot hunt without tags. He cannot hunt with a bow if he doesn't own one. So sounds like he is SOL if he wants to hunt on his own. \n\nTell your brother he is welcome to hunt on your property if he has all the proper licenses, tags, and equipment. Tell him he also has to take a hunting safety class (I assume that exists). This is your property, don't let him bulldoze you. It is your responsibility to make sure any hunting done on your property is done safely and legally.", "Your reasons for hunting make perfect sense, but your comment of \"he did very little to care for our ailing father\" makes me feel this is about more than that and you have some unresolved issues here  \n\n\nIf your dad left him guns in his will, and it sounds like you accept that as fact, your not giving him the guns feels like more punishment.   \n\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother doesn't take this seriously. He doesn't have a hunting or firearm license. Hunting is dangerous and I assume you don't want to be out there with someone who wants to skirt the rules and potentially doesn't know what they are doing. So there's a legal issue and potential safety issues.", "You get to decide for whom you accept responsibility.   Your brother can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t try to, decide that you are responsible for him while he is breaking the law. \n\nWhether or not your brother helped care for your father doesn\u2019t matter, so don\u2019t mention it when discussing this IRL. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Many states including the one I live in require a license to hunt even on your own land with only a few exceptions. Game wardens in my state have vast powers and can even come onto private property if they hear shooting and think hunting is going on. Your land and your rules but depending your jurisdiction it could actually be illegal for him to hunt without a license.", "NTA I would suggest putting up several no trespassing signs so if he were to sneak on to hunt and get hurt you kinda have a CYA.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to hunt, he needs to start with the basics.  Hunters Safety course and a license just to start.  \n\nThe last thing anyone needs is the game warden showing up", "NTA obviously your brother thinks the rules don't apply to him. He doesn't have a license to hunt that's crazy and he doesn't have his firearm license. Nope I wouldn't chance that..", "Nta at all, and he had better buy his own bow and practice for 6 months to a year before trying to hunt anything.", "NTA thank you for being a **responsible** gun owner, when your brother is not.", "YTA. Decided to take LandLORD to the next level huh?", "ESH- I was totally in your favor until you just got to the point where you said...\"I don't want my brother out there with me\".   So really, the excuses about the tags and the license are irrelevant- as you could provide those as requirments, that once met- \"you just really don't want him out there\"  So that's the real issue. You got the land and the guns and you don't want your brother there.  Unless there's more context that fully justifies that, you don't get a pass.  \n\nYour brother sucks because he's trying to skate appropriate laws and regulations, and expects to be provided for in regards to gear.", "Hunter education courses are required for hunting licenses (including bow hunting) in every state I've lived in, although some states waive the course for members of the military.", "I\u2019m currently holding them as my brother doesn\u2019t have the proper licences to carry a firearm. There is a stipulation in the will that if he gets his licence with in one year I am to give him his guns. I fully intend to do that . Currently he doesn\u2019t have the licence so he legally can\u2019t carry a gun in our area.", "I\u2019m from Ontario , Canada . \nYou can have a hunting licence since bows are not considered fire arms , but you need a secondary licence to use a firearm. In this case he has a hunting licence but doesn\u2019t have the firearms licence.", "Lol you're a nut if this is a serious comment.", "Nope safety concerns", "Yes I don\u2019t want him out there this season with me that isn\u2019t to say I wouldn\u2019t let him out there once he gets his licensing done. \nHunting was a huge part or my relationship with my father. Not so much with my brother .\nHe maybe hunted twice with us in the last 15 years . He\u2019s never made an effort to maintain trails or take care of the property that was left to me to do. My father was gravely Ill for the last 3 years and each season could have been his last and my brother never came to take him out with me .

Good going landlord!", "It was unclear in the original post that you would feel differently if he did all the necessary things. I think this is the answer- you roadmap it for him clearly as to what is required and then stick to your guns (see what I did there?). \n\nSo what if he got his licensing THIS season?", "Correct , he could shoot if he is under my direct supervision and a single firearm is used between us . The problem arises that he wants his own firearm which if caught I could lose not only that firearm but my own licence and firearms.", "Dude you do know hunting without a license is illegal right?", "If he had his firearms licence it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019d just tell him he could hunt a particular parcel on the property . Both my dad and I had been after him for years to get it but he never filed his paperwork until 2 months after my dad died", "Definitely NTA. You should probably set up cameras on your property in case he decides to hunt on it anyway."]}
