As a fellow ethical hunter, I understand where you're coming from.  I hate hunters that don't take the sport seriously and make no effort to be proficient with their weapon.

Yes, your brother is a grown man.  Yes he's been briefed on the requirement to own a firearm.  I'm assuming you're in Canada and not the US due to your comments on a firearms license.  So why don't you go the extra mile and help your brother get his firearm license so he can inherit those heirlooms.  Maybe this is an opportunity for you and your brother to form a relationship over something your father clearly enjoyed.
