This is a learning experience. Confrontation is a necessary part of life but it doesn\u2019t have to be a negative experience when handled correctly. And you are completely within your rights to walk away if the other person is aggressive or if you need time to cool down. But it\u2019s something even adults have to relearn or even learn for the first time sometimes. Let him know he can use your other nickname but this one is sentimental to your mom and sister. Even if he were you birth father that would be a valid request unless you were specifically doing it to be mean. But i don\u2019t think you are. I think you\u2019re processing hard emotions and it\u2019s coming out bc this is really sentimental to you. Younger brains take longer to adjust to big life changes, so your feelings are normal.

Everyone around *him* is calling you \"Lizzy.\" Even if your friends are calling you Beth, that's not who he's primarily interacting with.

That by using this nickname, he becomes part of your extended family. \n\nYou telling him not to use it, is also telling him that he's not family. That is absolutely an OK thing to happen. That is a boundary you are 100% entitled to assert. \n\nBut there are ways of doing it that hurt less. \n\n\"Please don't call me X, only family can call me that\". Ouch. \n\nVersus\n\n\"Please don't call me X, please call me Y instead. That's what friends call me\". \n\nThe first one says, \"I am hostile to you\".

But it's only my nephews (or family say it when referring to me to the boys). I said to him it's a special name only they call me as their aunty. Everyone else calls me by my name, but it's special that they have a different name for me. Still similar to my name but just a tad different. \nSo I get the sentimental side of your nickname. Your mums boyfriend isn't part of that. \nI would try having a polite word with him.

You don't mean any offence by it, and you're happy for him to call you by the nickname your friends use, but youd rather he not use the name that is special between your mum and sister etc. Or Maybe he would like to come up with a new nickname for you?

And offer that he can call you by your friends nickname or maybe choose a new one if you're comfortable with that. \n\nI'd try not to be angry with him when you have this conversation, because to him he doesn't realise its upsetting you or why it's upsetting you. He hears your mum and sister call you it so has caught on to it but I don't think he means offense by doing it, so I'd try and remember that when you talk to him and stay calm and friendly. That way he shouldn't be too offended.\n\n If he were to refuse to stop calling you it and become awkward, I would ignore him when he calls you by the name, don't respond, and if he still doesn't get the hint, then I'd have a firmer word with him saying you will not be responding to him when he calls you that because you've already explained why, and he has no right to call you that and he should stick to your real name. \n\nHopefully he'll be fine and understand your reasons though and stick to your other nickname your friends call you. \n\nGood luck.", "Relax.

So tell him kindly.\n\n\"My name ______ is a special name just for Mom and my sister. Please call me ______. I appreciate your respect about this.\" Or words you like.\n\nMen like to be respected. If needed, ask if he would feel respected if you used a name he didn't like.\n\nRepeat if he does it again. Again, kindly. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA - because you haven\u2019t addressed him directly. You don\u2019t like this person so this is a way you can keep him separate from your \u201creal\u201d family.", "YTA\n\nSo you complained to your mom. \n\nBut you\u2019ve said nothing to HIM about it. Like it not, he\u2019s part of your family right now. He doesn\u2019t know that you don\u2019t want him to call you that. The fact that he has used the nickname could be two things: it\u2019s either what he hears most and doesn\u2019t even notice he\u2019s used it, or he feels closer to you now. Neither of those are malicious. \n\nDon\u2019t snap at all. Just be kind. \u201cHey, youve called me X a few times lately. Please don\u2019t, that\u2019s a nickname only Mom and sis get to use. It\u2019s a personal connection with them and I don\u2019t let anyone else call me by it. Even my friends only call me by Z, which you know you could use too if you wanted.\u201d\n\nJust use your words and have a conversation. He can\u2019t read your mind.", "Inappropriately seasoned beef", "NAH\n\nJust tell him that that nickname is only for your sister and mother.", "There\u2019s very few people in my life who can address me by my nickname, and I go off big time on the ones who don\u2019t know me enough to address me by that nickname.  NTA OP.", "It's very important for you to start communicating what you want and need clearly and directly.  If you don't want your step-father to call you by a certain nickname, tell him.  Tell him politely but firmly.  If you want your mother to ask your step-father not to call you by a certain nick-name, tell her how you feel and ask if she'll convey it to your stepfather.  \n\nIt's completely fine for you not to want him to call you the nickname.  But it's not fine for you to be playing games, and not responding, and becoming silent and hostile when the poor man likely has not idea that his use of that name bothers you so much.\n\nI'm going to say gentle YTA, not because you don't want him to use that nickname, but because of the way you've been handling it.", "NAH, my brother is named after my dad, so he was Junior which very quickly became Juni. The only ones who call him that is our siblings, the niblings (Uncle Juni), and my parents. Even my dad\u2019s wife calls him Junior. It\u2019s weird for him to assume he can, but on the other hand, if the only people he\u2019s around use that name for you, I could see how he could think it\u2019s your preferred nickname. If he knows you don\u2019t want him to call you that, and he continues to do so, well, then he\u2019s the asshole.", "He needs to know that you\u2019ve outgrown your nickname, and that your mom & sister call you that out of habit, but that you don\u2019t like it. He can\u2019t read your mind.", "Yeah mom was a bit of an AH here but OP and mom\u2019s partner each did nothing wrong", "NTA. Pick a totaly random name that doesn't fit him at all, something obviously wrong. Maybe change to a random one each time, maybe call him a lover's cheesy name (actually, I like that best). When he calls you by the name you don't want him to use reply, \"Yeah, [WrongName] ...\" or \"Yeah, SexyBaby, ...\" \n\nDon't acknowledge the name swap unless he acknowledges his mistake.", "NTA. I get it - I feel you should be INVITED before you use a nickname\n\nMy favorite cousin gave me a nickname when we were little because he couldn\u2019t say my name. He was a Marine who died in Kuwait in 2003.  All through my childhood, my baby cousins used this nickname and still do at times. My aunties all use it when telling me they love me.  My nieces and nephews all call me Tia NICKNAME\n\nMy surgeon husband\u2019s former nurse started using it. It\u2019s an easily seen nickname (think Missy for Melissa), but she started using it not knowing my family uses it - like she thinks she gave it to me. She uses it on Facebook, text messages, any time we talk (thankfully not often now). I seriously cut this woman out of my life over this - also because she made fun of Biden\u2019s stutter knowing my daughter has a speech impediment.  I did call her out on her FB post on that \u201cHow dare she do that knowing \u2026. Then claim to love my kids as family and that I hoped my daughter never knew what she said\u2026.\u201d\n\nNicknames are invited or created by someone you have a deep relationship with.  Like I have a friend James who goes by Jay, and if he didn\u2019t introduce himself as Jay, I would have called him James.", "NAH\n\nI hundy percent get you with this one BUT he might feel that you\u2019re comfortable enough around each other for him to use the nickname too. Just let him know and I doubt it\u2019ll be a huge deal", "I will only respond to 2 people that call me that, and you are not on that list."]}
