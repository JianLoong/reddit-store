My son looked at him and said my name isn\u2019t Jimmy it\u2019s James and if you don\u2019t call me by my name I won\u2019t respond.  \n\nI know it\u2019s not exactly the same but OP needs to stand up for herself and tell the stepdad that isn\u2019t the name they want him to call her.  It is basic respect to call someone by their preferred name.  I don\u2019t care if someone said I want you to call me poopy mcbuttface mcgee (I call my dog this) if that\u2019s what they wanted to be called then that\u2019s how I would address them.", "Problem is she hasn\u2019t told him not to use it, she just keep catching an attitude when answering or ignoring him and just giving him a nasty look. She hasn\u2019t set that boundary she just expects him to be a mind reader and know that\u2019s not OK and to use the other nickname.", "There's no reason to phrase it like that. None at all. A simple \"that's a name only my mom and sister use\" is fine", "I understand that but, you\u2019re causing a bigger issues by sending mixed signals on the situation. As adults we need to be upfront and clear about our feelings. People aren\u2019t mind readers. Your step father may just see you as a rebellious teen rather than someone who\u2019s genuinely upset by something he may not know is wrong. Sometimes we have to act like grown ups (even if we don\u2019t wanna) and confront people, but do it in a way that\u2019s not rude, just express how you feel but don\u2019t be mean about it. Like \u201chey, can we talk? You\u2019ve been using x name a lot and it\u2019s a name that is sentimental from childhood and I\u2019m only ok with mom and sister calling me that. Could you use y name or z name instead?\u201d", "Agree with the comment above. I would phrase it like \"I only want my mom and sister to call me this\" rather than \"this is my family nickname and you can't use it,\" because implying that after 5 or 6 years he's not part of your family would be hurtful. I'm sure you carry resentment based on the breakup of your parents, and that's extremely natural and normal, but I think you'll feel better if you state your needs directly and kindly rather than resentfully being passive aggressive.", "By not confronting it and instead just giving attitude and ignoring them when they say your nickname, you are starting beef.", "So you\u2019d rather sit there and scowl at the person without expressing a reason? That really sound better than having a mature conversation?", "My brother once explained that I got to call him his child nickname becasue I was there when he was a child and to me that was his name.  No one else had earned that right and never would, as he was an adult now.  \n\nOn the other hand he could be feeling left out and feel more connected as a family member using the nickname.  I would be gentle when you explain it.   The worst is when something festers and builds and you explode on someone when you never even told them it was a problem.  That usually always makes you the asshole by not communicating what you actually want.", "I\u2019m the same but sometimes it must be done. Probably easier to bring it up when he *hasn\u2019t* just used the nickname, because then you won\u2019t feel so emotional about it.", "You don't need to \"confront\" anyone. You just need to let him know that you'd rather keep that name for your mum and sister.", "He\u2019s an adult, it\u2019s highly unlikely he\u2019ll be upset about it. Though I understand your concern, i didn\u2019t like confrontation at that age either, but you get better at it, you have to.", "please explain how glaring at somebody and complaining to your mom about it instead *isn't* starting beef.", "That's the real issue to be addressed and the name is just the manifestation of the lack of closeness you feel. I wonder what that's all about for you?", "I'm not going to say you're the AH in this situation but consider that he may not know before getting annoyed with him. Maybe there's a way you can explain it without it feeling like a confrontation - like, \"Hey, you've called me X few times and I know you've heard others do it, but I'd really prefer if you'd stick with Y.\"\n\nNAH", "Sometimes you have to confront a situation to move past it.", "You're 16 and you've known this guy 5 years. You can't expect mom to run interference between you 2. I saw you don't like confrontation but there's no reason this needs to be confrontational. Just casually say hey I know you hear mom calling me xxxxx but that's from when I was little. I really don't like anyone else doing it. All my friends call me yyyyy, so that's cool if you want to use it. Then give him a bit of grace he's likely to slip up now and then since he hears the other being used.", "if your tone is right, he should be understanding and i deff understand wym though \n\nMy family pronounces my name in a certain way and it\u2019s not even that it\u2019s on purpose it\u2019s just culturally, the way they pronounce it is different from english. On the very rare occasion someone calls me by my Spanish name, it does catch me off guard but i usually don\u2019t really care. i just laugh and say \u201chaha that\u2019s only how my family says my name\u201d", "Then he gets sad. Most likely he will move through that sadness and it will only be momentary.\n\nHe will be far more sad if you start acting cold towards him and he doesn\u2019t understand it\u2019s because of the name.", "if you don't like it it's on you to tell him. not sure what you're expecting otherwise. if you just rely on \"sounding annoyed\" when he addresses you it wont solve anything, just make your relationship bad for (as far as he knows) no apparent reason. you have to communicate if you want him to address you a certain way and not other ways.", "You need to tell him that. If it\u2019s been 5/6 years, then you should be able to at least tell him you don\u2019t like it and tell him what you preferred to be called. He\u2019s not a mind reader so giving him dirty looks is not going to do anything but cause frustrations on both sides. \n\nA simple \u201chey, I know we\u2019ve know each other for a few years, but I just want to let you know I\u2019d prefer if only mom and sister call me X because it\u2019s a special nickname only they use for me. I don\u2019t mind being called a,b,c though!\u201d", "I was 5.5 when my brother was born. As an infant/toddler, he could not say my real name (3 syllables, a mouthful) and he gave me a very simplified 2 syllable name that he could say, and which caught with my dad and then the little brother that came after that little brother. \n\nWhen my youngest brother had his first kid, I was 34. He wondered what that kid would call me, and lo and behold, I became Aunt Stupid Childhood Nickname. I now have 6 nieces and nephews and they ALL call me that name. I don't mind it now and I think it's sweet that my baby brothers, now 36 and 37, still use that affectionate name for me. \n\nThis is all to say, that name ain't going anywhere, more new people will probably use it in the future, and it's probably worth figuring out what this guy did to get relegated to the not-my-family-never-will-be-my-family zone. He's been around a while. Might be worth talking with your mom about it?", "Yeah thats 100% true", "Honestly this is the only correct response. Totally valid to not want him to use it but you\u2019re not sure he knows it\u2019s an issue. I\u2019ll even go as far to add he\u2019s also an adult and must\u2019ve noticed it was something only your mom and sister say so he should\u2019ve asked before he used it. But i don\u2019t think either of you are truly an AH. Just a little thoughtless. It\u2019s not like you exploded on him, a moody teenager is age appropriate. And I\u2019m not saying moody to be dismissive, your brain is still developing impulse control, there\u2019s puberty, hormones, etc. It doesn\u2019t mean your feelings aren\u2019t valid, you\u2019re just still learning and developing better ways to react to them. This is a learning experience. Confrontation is a necessary part of life but it doesn\u2019t have to be a negative experience when handled correctly. And you are completely within your rights to walk away if the other person is aggressive or if you need time to cool down. But it\u2019s something even adults have to relearn or even learn for the first time sometimes. Let him know he can use your other nickname but this one is sentimental to your mom and sister. Even if he were you birth father that would be a valid request unless you were specifically doing it to be mean. But i don\u2019t think you are. I think you\u2019re processing hard emotions and it\u2019s coming out bc this is really sentimental to you. Younger brains take longer to adjust to big life changes, so your feelings are normal. You just need to work on how you react to them. And that will be an ongoing lesson throughout life."]}
