Beyond that Jews are very anti prosthelytic & if you're forcing your child to attend their services it may step on their beliefs & feet a bit. Many synagogues DO welcome guests & do want to teach & share, but they may not be as open to unannounced guests as a Catholic mass. so be mindful\n\nalso, I don't think attending services is gonna fix this. services are generally like... the most boring aspect of any religion you're not a part of. I would really suggest instead an event or activity that there may be religious people at that she might already want to go to. The best way to normalize religion is NOT through forced participation in the religion itself, but instead normalizing them as people just like she is. if she brought something important to school & someone broke it that wouldnt be okay regardless of religious beliefs.", "Who knew rosemary was so controversial", "\n\nI mean, breaking the rosary, and bullying, is not ok.  \n\nExcept you\u2019re just making her sit there, she\u2019s not learning anything about why religions do certain things and why and what they believe. You\u2019re essentially just letting her watch a foreign film with no subtitles. \n\nPersonally I think all religions are a piece of crap. That being said I would question if other peoples house of worship are an appropriate learning tool for your kid. Especially with violence happening in places two strangers might give regulars unnecessarily worry. \n\nI get what you\u2019re trying to do, so I\u2019ll go NTA, but find a better way of doing it.", "But religion tolerance isn't even necessarily the point. She took an item belonging to someone else and broke it. The item was a family heirloom. Take out the religion, it was still shitty behavior on your daughter's part and she most definitely did something wrong.

If you want her to respect the general idea of organized religion, forcing her to attend services is probably the fastest way to achieve the exact opposite.", "YTA - Religion = Punishment. is not the lesson to be teaching here.

This made me hate church and religion and to this day I dont fuck with them at all because its all bullshit. But im sure that wont happen with your plan....", "YTA. All you are doing is making her hate religion even more.

All this shows your daughter is that if you disrespect someone's religion you deserve to then have that religion shoved down your throat. This just isn't the way to solve this problem. The issue is half religion and half her not respecting other people's property.", "YTA if you want her to respect religious beliefs by using religion as a punishment. I can guarantee she absorbed nothing from Catholic Mass and will get even less from going to a synagogue. \"Respect all this boring droning about things you have no context for and have no background information on.\" \n\nYou're just reinforcing her belief that it's a stupid waste of time and she should be allowed to hold that belief. She just shouldn't be allowed to attack people for their beliefs and damage their property. The punishment doesn't fit the crime.", "NTA.\n\nI think this is a good way to show her that the world consists of more ideas than her own.\n\nI would check and make sure she's not a bully in other ways though. Sometimes despite our best intentions, kids bully people because of the peer group they are in.", "YTA. As someone who spent her childhood having religion shoved down her throat, this is not the way to go. Find another to show her the different religions but please, don't just drag her around from place to place. It isn't gonna teach her anything other than to just hate these places.", "YTA you can punish her without making her sit through sermons of toxic ideologies", "nta, but idk if taking her on a tour of religions is going to help. the issue is that shes a bully. it doesnt matter if she respects religion or not, it matters that she respects peoples autonomy and personal property", "NTA, however I'm not sure that this is going to be as effective as you think it will. This has just as much potential to backfire and make her resent religion more because it's being forced on her. The big problem here is that she's a jerk, and at that age where it's easier to make fun of people for being different than accept them. Granted, I am coming from an anti-religious bias having escaped from a toxic evangelical religion myself. So of course, I'm going to advise not stepping foot in a church as I think the institution itself is toxic. Maybe instead of taking her to Catholic mass, you can punish her in other ways like taking privileges away and requiring she apologize to this girl. Again, I think you're going to have a hard time doing anything where you're not \"the jerk\" because she's at that defiant age where everything anyone ever does is stupid.", "as a Jewish person, you really can\u2019t just randomly show up at a synagogue.

Probably wouldn't be the route I would go but I don't see anything cruel about it. \n\nMight want o fix the typo unless Catholics have changed a lot  \n\n\\>Maggie brought in her grandmas rosemary", "ESH\n\nFirst, the problem isn't TOTALLY about religious intolerance, though that is definitely a problem.  She's also just a bully with absolute disregard to other people's property. You need to address this first.\n\nSecond, just sitting in on a service isn't going to teach her why things like rosaries are sacred and deserve respect, even if you personally aren't Catholic. It's just a matter of respect.\n\nThird, from a Jewish person, don't just show up to a synagogue. You can call, set up for a Rabbi to talk to her, but we got enough going on and most synagogues have crazy high security right now. Safety beside the point, a church/temple is usually a religious person's safe place, and a stranger bringing someone into that space who hates me would not make me feel good.\n\nThere are better ways to go about this, most religious leaders would be happy to talk to your daughter, but until you deal with the first point, the fact that your daughter has no respect for others, taking her all these places can do a lot more harm than good.\n\nEdited for clarity", "Nta. If your gonna be an ass about religion you should at a bare minimum know what you are talking about first.\n\nIts also not a bad thing to be exposed to different views.

The parents were told that the boys did not have to take religious classes, but my sister put them in anyway, because the courses covered various religions. She thought it was a good idea so they would learn something about how the world ticks and also helps them to understand history as well as current events.\n\nThe kids enjoy the courses because they talk about the subject with friends from different religions, but mainly they like the course because they find it easy and it does wonders for their grade averages. \n\nI sent my own kids to Sunday school so they would learn something about religion. Religion plays a huge part in world events, so every human should know a little about it. My youngest son wants to be Pope.", "NTA, punishment fits the crime so good job on that. Do be aware though that she may start associating religion with \"bad\" so don't make it go on too long.", "NTA - this is a great approach. You aren\u2019t just punishing her for doing something stupid, you are using it as a teaching opportunity and opening her mind.", "NTA - let your daughter know that it's ok for her to be atheist, but (so long as it's not anything harmful) people are free to have their own faiths, and taking and destroying other people's property is not acceptable. \n\nI honestly think it's more important than ever to teach children especially about Judaism and Islam, as both those religions are often weaponised or used to spread intolerance, when fundamentally they're just faiths like any other and the majority of people who follow them are just ordinary people trying to get by. \n\nI will say I doubt she'll thank you for it now, but I hope one day she'll get it.", "NTA... this is a good way to teach her to respect people of different beliefs.

You definitely need to educate her, but I would hate you, as well, if you force religion on me. \n\n(And this is coming from a person who have read lots of big sized religious books and was forced to always go to church when I was in kindergarten and elementary school (back when my grandpa is still alive) )\n\nTry a different approach", "Yoir daughter likely deliberately broke the other girl's rosary. It's a blessed devotional item. A proper punishment would be to learn about the rosary.", "NTA.

Being religios could benefit the person. \n\nBut I don't think your way to teach your daugther is the right one. Masses are boring for teenagers. It is also often just the commercial form of religion. Better would be to show her things, where religion brings people together. Like volunteering work from the religius people, talking to people who got through hard times with help of their religion (I myself saw the importance of religion during a volunteer year, where people of all religions in small villages came together when the priest visited for a mess. Because it showed them, that they are also important - but this is another thema)", "NTA - I did EXACTLY this when my kid turned 7 (the age of reason).  Religion is supposed to have meaning to the individual and if she chooses to be religious, she has the right to experience, learn & either choose a religion that she truly identifies/connects with or to make the educated decision that she doesn\u2019t connect with any of them.\n\nI was raised in a Catholic household, lived an agnostic life during most of my lates teens & early 20s & became a Buddhist in my late 20s.
