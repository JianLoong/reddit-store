Beyond that Jews are very anti prosthelytic & if you're forcing your child to attend their services it may step on their beliefs & feet a bit. Many synagogues DO welcome guests & do want to teach & share, but they may not be as open to unannounced guests as a Catholic mass. so be mindful\n\nalso, I don't think attending services is gonna fix this. services are generally like... the most boring aspect of any religion you're not a part of. I would really suggest instead an event or activity that there may be religious people at that she might already want to go to. The best way to normalize religion is NOT through forced participation in the religion itself, but instead normalizing them as people just like she is. if she brought something important to school & someone broke it that wouldnt be okay regardless of religious beliefs.", "Who knew rosemary was so controversial", "\n\nI mean, breaking the rosary, and bullying, is not ok.  \n\nExcept you\u2019re just making her sit there, she\u2019s not learning anything about why religions do certain things and why and what they believe.

She took an item belonging to someone else and broke it. The item was a family heirloom. Take out the religion, it was still shitty behavior on your daughter's part and she most definitely did something wrong.

This has just as much potential to backfire and make her resent religion more because it's being forced on her. The big problem here is that she's a jerk, and at that age where it's easier to make fun of people for being different than accept them. Granted, I am coming from an anti-religious bias having escaped from a toxic evangelical religion myself. So of course, I'm going to advise not stepping foot in a church as I think the institution itself is toxic. Maybe instead of taking her to Catholic mass, you can punish her in other ways like taking privileges away and requiring she apologize to this girl. Again, I think you're going to have a hard time doing anything where you're not \"the jerk\" because she's at that defiant age where everything anyone ever does is stupid.", "as a Jewish person, you really can\u2019t just randomly show up at a synagogue.

She's also just a bully with absolute disregard to other people's property. You need to address this first.\n\nSecond, just sitting in on a service isn't going to teach her why things like rosaries are sacred and deserve respect, even if you personally aren't Catholic. It's just a matter of respect.\n\nThird, from a Jewish person, don't just show up to a synagogue. You can call, set up for a Rabbi to talk to her, but we got enough going on and most synagogues have crazy high security right now. Safety beside the point, a church/temple is usually a religious person's safe place, and a stranger bringing someone into that space who hates me would not make me feel good.\n\nThere are better ways to go about this, most religious leaders would be happy to talk to your daughter, but until you deal with the first point, the fact that your daughter has no respect for others, taking her all these places can do a lot more harm than good.\n\nEdited for clarity", "Nta.

It is also often just the commercial form of religion. Better would be to show her things, where religion brings people together. Like volunteering work from the religius people, talking to people who got through hard times with help of their religion (I myself saw the importance of religion during a volunteer year, where people of all religions in small villages came together when the priest visited for a mess.
