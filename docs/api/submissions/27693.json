If you both live in Scotland and are committed to being part of it (wherever you were born) you're Scottish, and if not, you aren't.  This is pretty much the SNP's line on who gets to  be a Scottish citizen at the time we split from the UK.", "NTA.

It\u2019s odd that the mother didn\u2019t know where her daughter was for all those years. Did she ever mail a care package or a greeting card that she had to address?

So I sometimes call Brits, Americans and Australians all English as in English speaker. \n\nSo while I get where you\u2019re coming from, and I mostly think she should just accept your wishes.
