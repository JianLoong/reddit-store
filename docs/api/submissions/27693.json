If you both live in Scotland and are committed to being part of it (wherever you were born) you're Scottish, and if not, you aren't.

It\u2019s odd that the mother didn\u2019t know where her daughter was for all those years. Did she ever mail a care package or a greeting card that she had to address?

So I sometimes call Brits, Americans and Australians all English as in English speaker. \n\nSo while I get where you\u2019re coming from, and I mostly think she should just accept your wishes.

There's a separate country called Northern Ireland?", "I\u2019ve met her before this, and she seemed perfectly reasonable up until now. I did know she has occasionally blown things slightly out of proportion but it\u2019s never been described as anything like this so I am a little surprised.", "Definitely not English, I wouldn\u2019t mind if she had been telling people I\u2019m British bc I am.", "Thank you!

But not meaning offence doesn\u2019t take offence out of it. \n4. Emma did interject, as I said in the post.\n5.

She's showing ignorance.", "This is so weird. She has a PhD and can't handle being corrected? Like I said in my other post, this is so bizarre. Especially that she has taken to blowing up your phone over a very short conversation that didn't have to be anything other than a correction. \n\nIt's like if someone told someone else that I was Puerto Rican and corrected that I'm Dominican. It's a common mistake, but usually the other person would just say oh okay, my bad!", "He needs to start calling her by the wrong name, then insist she's got it wrong, her name actually *is* Dolly, or Shaniqua, or Crystal.
