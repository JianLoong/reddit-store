It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that an established company, especially construction where I assume they produce a ton of trash, would so careless as to use a dumpster that isn\u2019t theirs. NTA and petty AF rock on bro", "NTA. Isn't what that company did actually illegal? And that construction company should have better sense in any case.", "NTA but in the future call the cops and get them fined so they don't pull shit like that to other people. Let them know it's illegal dumping and you have evidence.", "NTA - I volunteer for a group that cleans up trash in the bush. They find papers like you did; and gives them to the cops/conservation. You did good.", "It's called \"theft of services\" - NTA. Next time, though, I'd go or call them to give them the opportunity to get their stuff out of the dumpster. If they didn't I'd report it to the police, have my employees take it to the dump, then go to small claims court for the employees wages and costs. That hopefully will give you a no nonsense reputation in the neighborhood, if you don't have one now. There's no reason to be a doormat.", "NTA. I've done the same several times. In most areas it's illegal to put trash in someone else's receptacle. I tried calling the company but I've never gotten a satisfactory response.

This is funny", "NTA.\n\nGood for you.", "NTA\n\nTrash collection costs money. The dumpster is for the business(es) paying. You may need to start locking it if this problem persists.", "NTA. I think what you did was fair. The construction company FAFO'd. Your wife is wrong.", "NTA - construction companies are the same as any other- required to take care of their own trash. Sounds like the owner was trying to save a few hundred dollars by using dumpsters they found. Depending on where you are, it\u2019s also illegal, and can result in huge fines for each item. \n\nYou may need to invest in locks, and lock the dumpster up at night if it persists.", "NTA. This made my skin itch. Where I live we have shared dumpsters in an alley behind our houses. It's supposed to be 3 houses per, each house allotted 1/3 of the dumpster. Well ours is always full. And it happens to be outside of our wall, so we get to stare at mountains of trash roughly 2-3 times a week.

Its even worse knowing that it wasn\u2019t even me that put most of that trash in there. I\u2019ve had to fight off trash pandas because I had to put trash bags beside the bins.
