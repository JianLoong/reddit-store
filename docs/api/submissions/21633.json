My dad tried to *over* help by doing things we never asked or wanted him to do. He'd come over everyday for the first week at random times. He'd help himself to whatever.

I asked him several times to just slow down, and let us get a handle on things first. After I told him it was annoying me he said \"I'm not just *anyone*, I'm your *father*\". I told him that if I needed help I'd ask and I'd appreciate it if he stopped coming by unannounced as I wanted my privacy and to enjoy my space freely.

Yes he\u2019s in the wrong but no need to let it get worse.", "NTA. I'm guessing that he was living out his ranch life fantasy. He wanted to help, but he also wanted what *he* wanted. If you lived in an apartment and he was just turning up all the time to visit it wouldn't be okay. It doesn't make a difference that he's being \"helpful\".\n\nIf he thinks being able to do whatever he wants, leaving a mess behind, and disrupting your enjoyment of *your own home* is a necessity to be \"welcome\" I wonder about his manners. Petty me says next time you're at his place you hang random pictures on the wall or start rearranging the kitchen cabinets to be \"helpful\" (petty me is also an AH)."]}
