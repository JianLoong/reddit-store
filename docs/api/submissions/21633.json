He might feel like he is being sidelined and needs to prove his worth.\n\nWhat he needs to know is that you\u2019re an adult and need room to grow for yourself.

While I know that you know how to do all the things, we were really looking forward to getting to that stuff ourselves, and getting to figure it out together.  We made plans, and I was disappointed when you had taken the task on.  It was new for all of us, so I must have come across pretty harshly, and I\u2019m sorry.

I just closed on a ranch with my new husband. My dad tried to *over* help by doing things we never asked or wanted him to do. He'd come over everyday for the first week at random times. He'd help himself to whatever. For instance, he opened my husband's brand new weedeater and just started going to town. My husband was excited to use it! He'd also not been putting tools back. I asked him several times to just slow down, and let us get a handle on things first. After I told him it was annoying me he said \"I'm not just *anyone*, I'm your *father*\". I told him that if I needed help I'd ask and I'd appreciate it if he stopped coming by unannounced as I wanted my privacy and to enjoy my space freely. He apologized and said he understood. \n\nI've invited him over twice now for dinner. This was his response this evening: \"After the reception received last time, I no longer feel very welcomed, so I won't be coming over again.\"\n\nI replied with: \"I'm sorry you feel that way.

Your father doesn\u2019t understand that u are grown up and has ur individual life", "NTA but take him out to lunch and communicate.  Yes he\u2019s in the wrong but no need to let it get worse.", "NTA. I'm guessing that he was living out his ranch life fantasy. He wanted to help, but he also wanted what *he* wanted. If you lived in an apartment and he was just turning up all the time to visit it wouldn't be okay. It doesn't make a difference that he's being \"helpful\".\n\nIf he thinks being able to do whatever he wants, leaving a mess behind, and disrupting your enjoyment of *your own home* is a necessity to be \"welcome\" I wonder about his manners. Petty me says next time you're at his place you hang random pictures on the wall or start rearranging the kitchen cabinets to be \"helpful\" (petty me is also an AH).", "NTA. this is the battle that i also have to dealt with.  at least he is not MIL.", "I'll probably catch hell for this, but YTA. \n\nI get it about your husband wanting to play with his new tools... but honestly... your dad just wants to feel needed and helpful. I'd give anything for my dad to be able to annoy me by doing yard work. He'd love that too, but his body is failing him these days and he can't do stuff like he used to. \n\nTime flies. Life can be fragile. You can send your dad to my place, my husband would gladly accept the help lol. You'd sure miss him if he was gone. That's all I mean.", "YTA. Your dad did chores that\u2019s your husband was so excited to do that he didn\u2019t.", "NTA- he was trying to help but he overstepped bigtime and wore out his welcome. Give him time to cool off and have a conversation with him. Thank him somewhat but set boundaries", "NTA. Your dad isn't all there. He obviously took a great interest in your ranch and took it too far. About the only thing you could have done is redirect his energy into something useful, or at least harmless, like you would a 5 year old.\n\nNow that he is insulted, butt hurt, you might entice him with a chore that only he can do (change a spark plug or something), with a reward of fresh pie or something he cherishes. In asking, just tell him that you were stressed with the move and you are sorry that you were a little abrupt. He might grudgingly accept but that is up to you. On the other hand, you might want to enjoy the peace for a bit.", "NTA. Also my dad did the same thing,  so I started randomly showing up at his house to vaccuum.  He got the message.", "the general rule is to not do anything to a new home for 6 months so you can figure out what really needs to be done and what is not so bad after all.\n\nmanplain to him that he's welcome as long as he doesn't do or say anything because y'all got to work it all out.  give him a notebook so he can log his ideas with the understanding you're not going to look at it for 6 months.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMy mom likes to pull that passive aggressive and temper tantrum bullshit too.  Try not to let his pettiness ruin the vibe of your new home.  \n\nCongrats on your ranch!!!  I hope you and your husband have a lot of fun!", "No, you are NTA.", "Lol NTA.  I think you showed great restraint with your response.  I'd have been all, \"Promise?\"", "NTA Absolutely not. Let him sulk, he\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA being your father carries no privilege or entitlement, you are an adult which makes you peers and deserving respect as such.", "It\u2019s so passive aggressive", "Uh no. Dad wildly overstepped and is experiencing the discomfort of realising this. Let him have his learning opportunity so their relationship can become better for it.", ">but honestly... your dad just wants to feel needed and helpful\n\n\nThen wait to actually offer the help they will need you for? \n\n\n>I'd give anything for my dad to be able to annoy me by doing yard work.\n\n\nWhat a life. Unfortunately, you aren't the Op of this story."]}
