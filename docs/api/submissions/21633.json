I just closed on a ranch with my new husband. My dad tried to *over* help by doing things we never asked or wanted him to do. He'd come over everyday for the first week at random times. He'd help himself to whatever. For instance, he opened my husband's brand new weedeater and just started going to town. My husband was excited to use it! He'd also not been putting tools back.

Your father doesn\u2019t understand that u are grown up and has ur individual life", "NTA but take him out to lunch and communicate.  Yes he\u2019s in the wrong but no need to let it get worse.", "NTA. I'm guessing that he was living out his ranch life fantasy. He wanted to help, but he also wanted what *he* wanted. If you lived in an apartment and he was just turning up all the time to visit it wouldn't be okay. It doesn't make a difference that he's being \"helpful\".\n\nIf he thinks being able to do whatever he wants, leaving a mess behind, and disrupting your enjoyment of *your own home* is a necessity to be \"welcome\" I wonder about his manners. Petty me says next time you're at his place you hang random pictures on the wall or start rearranging the kitchen cabinets to be \"helpful\" (petty me is also an AH).", "NTA. this is the battle that i also have to dealt with.  at least he is not MIL.", "I'll probably catch hell for this, but YTA. \n\nI get it about your husband wanting to play with his new tools... but honestly... your dad just wants to feel needed and helpful. I'd give anything for my dad to be able to annoy me by doing yard work. He'd love that too, but his body is failing him these days and he can't do stuff like he used to. \n\nTime flies. Life can be fragile. You can send your dad to my place, my husband would gladly accept the help lol. You'd sure miss him if he was gone. That's all I mean.", "YTA. Your dad did chores that\u2019s your husband was so excited to do that he didn\u2019t.", "NTA- he was trying to help but he overstepped bigtime and wore out his welcome. Give him time to cool off and have a conversation with him. Thank him somewhat but set boundaries", "NTA. Your dad isn't all there. He obviously took a great interest in your ranch and took it too far. About the only thing you could have done is redirect his energy into something useful, or at least harmless, like you would a 5 year old.\n\nNow that he is insulted, butt hurt, you might entice him with a chore that only he can do (change a spark plug or something), with a reward of fresh pie or something he cherishes. In asking, just tell him that you were stressed with the move and you are sorry that you were a little abrupt. He might grudgingly accept but that is up to you. On the other hand, you might want to enjoy the peace for a bit.", "NTA. Also my dad did the same thing,  so I started randomly showing up at his house to vaccuum.  He got the message.", "the general rule is to not do anything to a new home for 6 months so you can figure out what really needs to be done and what is not so bad after all.\n\nmanplain to him that he's welcome as long as he doesn't do or say anything because y'all got to work it all out.  give him a notebook so he can log his ideas with the understanding you're not going to look at it for 6 months.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMy mom likes to pull that passive aggressive and temper tantrum bullshit too.  Try not to let his pettiness ruin the vibe of your new home.  \n\nCongrats on your ranch!!!  I hope you and your husband have a lot of fun!", "No, you are NTA.", "Lol NTA.  I think you showed great restraint with your response.  I'd have been all, \"Promise?\"", "NTA Absolutely not. Let him sulk, he\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA being your father carries no privilege or entitlement, you are an adult which makes you peers and deserving respect as such.", "It\u2019s so passive aggressive", "Uh no. Dad wildly overstepped and is experiencing the discomfort of realising this. Let him have his learning opportunity so their relationship can become better for it.", ">but honestly... your dad just wants to feel needed and helpful\n\n\nThen wait to actually offer the help they will need you for? \n\n\n>I'd give anything for my dad to be able to annoy me by doing yard work.\n\n\nWhat a life. Unfortunately, you aren't the Op of this story.", "NTA\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if you end up regretting it. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda the weird thing with enthusiasm. When you have it yourself about something others just abruptly thrusting themselves into your space feels like encroachment. \n\nWhen your own enthusiasm dies down a little or you need a bit of help for whatever reason you realise how damn hard it is to find someone that has the time or resources to help, let alone enthusiasm. People with enthusiasm for something that doesn\u2019t belong to them or doesn\u2019t actually pay off in any way for them personally? That so rare it\u2019s generally confined to family.  \n\nBasically I tend to avoid deliberately squashing enthusiasm towards something in general so long as it isn\u2019t insane or illegal. Squashing the enthusiasm in someone, particularly family, who wants wants to help me directly when it\u2019s of no benefit to themselves?  I will do my utmost to avoid that. If it was really that difficult to manage you may have been way better off directing the enthusiasm into a specific area or project to contain it until things settled down and of course being grateful as hell. \n\nBut you know, you went a different way\u2026", "NTA at all...you are doing great", "NTA- Is your dad a Boomer generation? I have had similar issues w my parents and lack of boundaries/offense at any boundary setting.", "NTA for me. Coming over and doing things (even if its helpful) unannounced is not acceptable even if you're family. And if you're gonna be a drama Queen when you got reprimanded the problem is your attitude.", "Your father is being manipulative. \n\nHe should not be taking tools and acting as if he owns your home. \n\nTo punish you for raising this he is cutting off his nose to spite his face.\n\nNTA", " \n\nYour father has obviously taken a great interest in your farm and carried it far.", "You do claim to be an \"asshole enthusiast.\"", "Thank you", "I think about the death part. I've had huge death losses in my life. That shouldn't be a factor in how you let someone treat you, though, IMHO. Everyone dies. Just because my dad will die eventually doesn't mean I have to let him walk all over me.", "Agreed. I also think NTA but the thought of my dad (also no longer with us) feeling not welcome at my house makes me feel a bit teary.", "I get your point, totally, but unfortunately, that's not the dynamic here. \n\nMy dad wanting to feel needed and helpful isn't my problem. I've tried to involve my dad and have a relationship with him, but I'm done sacrificing myself in the process. I've given a lot to him over the years, just as he has me. He needs to respect my boundaries and privacy, though.. Of course, I want him to come over and help! Of course I want to hang out with him and I value time with him, but he can't come over whenever he wants and use stuff like it's his, because it's not.", "I even asked him if I could make him a \"list\" and times he could come by. At first, he was totally agreeable and understanding. Now he's barely talking to me.", "I see your point, but I didn't squash enthusiasm. I set a boundary. Big difference.", "I'm enjoying the peace ha", "Agreed", "Your dad reminds me a lot like my dad. Just petty and self centered for no reason NTA", "I had to have this conversation with my in laws after my daughter was born. They would just be \u2018happening\u2019 to be visiting my neighbors (who are their friends) and then knock on my door after, in the middle of nap time when I have three dogs\u2026. My husband was at work\u2026. It\u2019s annoying and honestly rude\u2026.. you did the right thing and your dad is just being passive aggressive. Just stand your ground, he will get over it if he wants to be part of your life", "NTA. Comment elsewhere.", "NTA. My husband and I closed on our farm last year and my family is already starting the \"Family Farm\" thing, and how they can't wait to \"help\"... I've been stressed for a year about this exact thing happening!\n\nToo bad your dad throws a tantrum when you enforce normal, reasonable boundaries.", "Could you send your dad over to my house now that your dad has some free time? I would welcome and gladly appreciate the help.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say YTA. Before my Dad died he always wanted to help but he was nearly completely blind and of course he made mistakes but I let him and then did it over without him knowing. I think your Dad just wanted to help and feel helpful and you\u2019ve really hurt him.", "NTA", "NTA. You deserve to have your space respected.", "NTA", "I sometimes think my dad wants to buy me a house just so he can do shit to it. Never dreamed about me getting married. Just being a homeowner. I mean he did pretty much say as much, but wants me to buy the house.  I didn\u2019t say anything, but I was like in my head nope. That man takes his time and everything would be a mess in the in between", "Nta\u2026 he needs to chill.", "Dude acts like an 11 year old. He should cry about it lol", "NTA are you sure we are talking about your adult father and not an 8 year old?", "Think about it this way. When your dad passes and can't be around anymore how much guilt would you have thinking back to this day? Was it worth an argument? I think he just wants to spend time with you. I'd give anything for my dad to do that with me.", "NTA. He is a giant baby. He wants it all his way on his own time. He does not want to give you the respect you deserve.", "NTA, it's your house, your rules as so many parents loved to say when we were kids", "NTA. My husband and I had the same problem with both it dad's last year when we bought our first house. My Mil was the one who got them to stop by telling them they had to wait to be invited instead of coming over whenever they felt like it", "Thank you", "Yep classic boomer behaviour. My mom was the same for a long time. \u201cI do what I want and if you don\u2019t like it you\u2019re ungrateful and hate me\u201d. Took years but she is better now, but they have to want to listen to you", "Yup, I keep putting off my parents coming over. They decide I need help gardening and don't ask hey do you like that bush, or like the grass that long. They will randomly go to the bathroom then 30 mins later I find they went to the garden and started hacking down what they don't like and choosing for me what I want my garden to look like, it's frustrating as fuck.\n\nthey like manicured lawns, I like wild grass/flowers and hate manicured lawns. Nothing worse than 'help' you didn't want in the first place where people come over and try to make things look they way they like them without asking what you want done.\n\nAsk people if they want help, ask what they want help with and do what they ask you not what you think they'll want.", "Classic boomer behaviour.", "Thanks for the reassurance that I'm being reasonable. \n\nGood luck with the farm life. It is A LOT of work, but it's work I enjoy and *want* to do. I don't see my dad's name on the deed, so I feel I'm totally justified in saying, \"Yo, dad, can I please have some privacy with my new husband at me new house?!\" I feel like he treats me like I'm 13... I shouldn't have to ask to be alone with my husband at the house I bought, and he shouldn't be pissy about it.", "Stop this. My dad's dead too, and I miss him like hell. That doesn't give me the right to shit on other people for having negative feelings about their parents.", "It was nice of you to do that for your dad. Sure, my dad wanted to be helpful, but only wanting to be helpful on *his* terms is not ok. If someone truly wanted to help someone, they'd ask for specifics. You dont just go into someone's house and start doing whatever you want... and him being my \"father\" doesn't give him free-for-all access to my place. Also, me setting boundaries is a new thing, and I'm starting to see how much my dad *doesn't* really respect me or the boundaries I set.", "This is wildly unacceptable, controlling, and juvenile behaviour. I have a sulky dad too. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That's an automatic rating applied by the sub - every time you get the top comment on a post, you get a point and different number sof points get different flairs.

We do goats and hay, yall?\n\n I feel you 100%. My step-dad has been watching hoof trimming on YT and seems to think it's all easy and we have fancy turning stalls and hoof clompers to keep them still.... like no buddy. We're wrestling 200lb goats old school on a stanchion. \n\nYour dad trying to enforce authority on your equipment, in your home, is asinine.", "Yes boundaries and respect are very important. It sucks when the parent is the one pouting but I\u2019m sure a phone call to share perspectives might help (assuming the exchange above was via text) or even a neutral - we obviously have different views here but let\u2019s move on sooner than later.", "I didn\u2019t shit, just shared my perspective.", "Yeah I\u2019m maybe clouded by my own feelings, I apologise. I realise we don\u2019t all have the same relationship with our fathers.", "Ugh. It sucks.", "Good to know!", "We have some cattle and hay fields. We also have chickens, horses, and pigs, too. Goats are crazy!! And definitely not easy. Invite your step-dad over to trim their hooves if it's so easy, then. Lol.", "Of course we don't. I wish I had a relationship with mine like it sounds you may have had with yours.", "Yeah. I go NC until he\u2019s done and calls me. Sometimes it\u2019s a full year. Long history of ridiculousness. I love him though. He just has no coping mechanisms and a huge secret ego. Wonderful when it\u2019s good though.", "Oh he was sexist and tried to tell me what to do in my own home although he was living with me because I was his carer in his final years.

I\u2019m not disagreeing that he\u2019s being pouty, but maybe he\u2019s just having a hard time letting go? Dads can sometimes really struggle with their little girls not depending on them anymore. You mentioned new husband, new house, basically a whole new season in life. I would put money your dad is just having a hard time keeping up with the changes and wants to ensure his place in your life and heart. Cut the man some slack, remind him that he\u2019s loved, but he has to let you settle and enjoy the newness. Once the dust has settled, find a project that you \u2018need\u2019 help with. He will get to feel useful, you\u2019ll get to smile knowingly.", "This could all have been avoided if you had just walked around naked all the time. Easy peasy.

Half the fun (for my husband and me, at least) of a new home is working on it together and feeling the satisfaction of turning it into what we want. It\u2019s awesome to have supportive family members who can pitch in when we need extra help, but someone else coming in and trying to take over is not cool. Just the misplaced tools would drive me crazy. Now it sounds like on top of initially swooping in and trying to dominate your new home experience, your dad thinks you should come groveling and begging him to come back and do it again. Nope. Your response was perfect.", " Give him time to cool off and have a conversation with him. Thank him somewhat but set boundaries", "Maybe so. I hope he comes around and shows me a little more respect.", "As I've said in a previous reply... I have experienced tremendous loss through death. Everyone dies. That inevitable fact doesn't excuse him to act any way he wants and disrespect me.", "If Dad's real motive were to spend all possible time remaining w/OP, he wouldn't be turning down invitations to come over. By doing so, he's showing he values having OP in a subordinate position more than their company as an equal. He's sulking over OP's refusal to take that subordinate position - something no parent has the right to demand of their adult child. OP has the right to ask for boundaries, and if Dad values his ability to ignore his child's boundaries more than he actually enjoys his child's company, it's his loss if he decides to forgo his child's company in the service of his precious sulk.", "Yes! When my spouse and I bought our first home, my dad totally overstepped boundaries too. He went all up and down the street, introducing himself to all the neighbors. People thought he was the one moving in. \ud83d\udc80 \n\nThen he gave me the full report in a phone call like he was just the best dad ever. I couldn\u2019t believe he would ruin his adult child\u2019s moving in experience like that.
