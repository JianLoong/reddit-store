Or the three that stayed together more of a group separate from the other three?", "NTA. \n\nAre you sure these 3 of your friends?", "Don't feel.bad about kicking out as bridesmaids. They decided to have their own vacation on you and your in-laws dime. Chalk it up to a life lesson and have a beautiful wedding without those three lack of support. NTA.", "INFO: how long was the total trip, and how many of the items on your potential itinerary were major expeditions like snorkeling, etc?\n\nBasically, if you were trying to pack the trip to the gills with activities I think it\u2019s fair for them to opt out at times, or have their own ideas. If it was a few small things over a spacious amount of time, not so much.", "Nta,  wnbta. It's pretty clear they used you for their own vacation.  These are not friends.", "Light ESH here.  Overplanning a boozy girls trip like this is a recipe for disaster, but if you haven't learned from experience as I have, it's understandable. \n\nThe point is to have fun.  On girls' trips though, people have different ideas of what's fun. Last girls trip I went on I and my BFF bailed on a wine tasting that one of the organizers was dead set on everyone attending.  I told her beforehand that I wasn't sure if I was up for it, because it was only 3 days and we'd rented a villa with a pool and I wanted pool time.  I paid for my portion of the wine tasting even though I didn't go just to smooth things over and I still caught some shit for it - whatever.  So in this regard I can sympathize with your friends - maybe they just wanted to chill and have fun.  A vacation can be exhausting when someone is planning every minute and they spent their money to be there, too.  It's fine to ask for one night of a bachelorette to be just about the bride, but a longer vacation that they spent significant amounts of their own money on?  Nah, that's probably the biggest trip they take all year.  You have to give them time to do what they want to as well.  And it's cool they got along to that degree. \n\nYour wedding is the celebration of you getting married.  A 5+ day trip?  that's not going to be all about you.  It's supposed to be about you and your friends spending time together and it probably would have been better to make sure everyone was really on board with all these plans first.\n\nActually now I'm leaning soft YTA.  Girls trips are difficult (I have friends who have sworn them off entirely) and it's fine to not have anticipated this but they still took time from work and spent money to come, and you're mad they didn't make it all about you?  IDK girl that's just not how it works.  You can uninvite them from the wedding but you better be prepared to never speak to these girls ever again if you do so.  They also might find it a relief, just saying.", "INFO: why is your username FutaFarm?", "I'm going with a very gentle YTA. Yes, it was supposed to be your celebration, and yes, it sounds like some of your friends blew you off on certain days. But, they spent their own money to get there and back, participate in events, etc., yet you expected them to adhere to only your schedule for 7 full days. That's simply not reasonable.", "\"destination bachelorette\" means YTA", "No you are definitely not the asshole. Your bachelorette is where you are supposed to have fun with your friends and they didn\u2019t even try to meet you half way even though you were providing them with an amazing trip. And if this is how they behave on your trip imagine the wedding. I would 100% support you kicking them out and staying with the bridesmaids who actually made an effort to make you happy.", "YTA - You left them behind on the FOURTH DAY? How many days was this? This is way too much. It sounds like something between an assignment and an ordeal. Bridesmaids are not hostages.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I feel like I gave my girls a great experience \" .. gauging their reaction, not that great of an experience - IF they actually had followed your plans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"And WIBTAH for kicking them out of the bridal party?\" .. It is pretty good a characterization of the bride's character when you look at how many bridesmaids (and friends) she manages to lose in the months up to her wedding.", "YTA If you're talking about events on the fourth day, that means that you asked your bridesmaids to take at least four or five days off of work. You asked them to spend $500 for flights. You asked him to spend money for activities. No offense, but there's no friend in the world that I would devote every waking minute to for 5 days. These are human beings, and each have their own inner worlds and personal priorities. Of course they acted like this was their vacation. Let's say they spent 5 days with you, and $1,000. A lot of people don't get that much more time off from work in a year, and when I was young, I probably didn't have much more than $1,000 to spend in a year on vacations. Give these women a break. They devoted a lot of time and money to you.", "NTA. If they were like this here what are they going to be like on your wedding day? Get rid of them.", "YTA. That sounds like a very expensive trip so I can completely understand why your bridesmaids wanted to select how they spent their time. How much celebrating do you require? The people I know are perfectly happy with a girls night out.", "They clearly used you for a free vacation, I would remove them from the bridal party because if they\u2019re not willing to celebrate with you you can\u2019t rely on them and being constantly late isn\u2019t a good sign for your wedding day either", "NTA.  ONLY $500 for airfare for this???  I wish you had invited me!", "NTA.  You were used for them to have a low-cost vacation.", "NTA", "NTA and you should kick them out of the wedding sooner rather than later.

None of the activities seem boring in the slightest and I believe the itinerary was shown to the bridesmaids beforehand as well. The bride organized a lavish trip for her and her bridesmaids to enjoy but those 3 were just bringing down the mood.

For them to be successful requires a lot of chill attitude and I'm not getting that you were super chill here.", "That was $800 they could have spent doing something else and they chose to spend it on your bachelorette trip. You could have been a lot more flexible with the itinerary so they could spend some time doing what they wanted to do.
