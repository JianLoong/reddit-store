Overplanning a boozy girls trip like this is a recipe for disaster, but if you haven't learned from experience as I have, it's understandable. \n\nThe point is to have fun.  On girls' trips though, people have different ideas of what's fun. Last girls trip I went on I and my BFF bailed on a wine tasting that one of the organizers was dead set on everyone attending.  I told her beforehand that I wasn't sure if I was up for it, because it was only 3 days and we'd rented a villa with a pool and I wanted pool time.  I paid for my portion of the wine tasting even though I didn't go just to smooth things over and I still caught some shit for it - whatever.  So in this regard I can sympathize with your friends - maybe they just wanted to chill and have fun.  A vacation can be exhausting when someone is planning every minute and they spent their money to be there, too.  It's fine to ask for one night of a bachelorette to be just about the bride, but a longer vacation that they spent significant amounts of their own money on?  Nah, that's probably the biggest trip they take all year.  You have to give them time to do what they want to as well.  And it's cool they got along to that degree. \n\nYour wedding is the celebration of you getting married.  A 5+ day trip?  that's not going to be all about you.  It's supposed to be about you and your friends spending time together and it probably would have been better to make sure everyone was really on board with all these plans first.\n\nActually now I'm leaning soft YTA.  Girls trips are difficult (I have friends who have sworn them off entirely) and it's fine to not have anticipated this but they still took time from work and spent money to come, and you're mad they didn't make it all about you?

These are human beings, and each have their own inner worlds and personal priorities. Of course they acted like this was their vacation. Let's say they spent 5 days with you, and $1,000. A lot of people don't get that much more time off from work in a year, and when I was young, I probably didn't have much more than $1,000 to spend in a year on vacations. Give these women a break.

They probably figured that if OP left without them she wouldn\u2019t care if they stayed at the house for the rest of the day. It\u2019s not like they went sightseeing or did some other activity on their own. They basically has a girls day in until the rest of the group returned.", "And it would be insane to ask your friends to pay $2K for a destination bachelorette, so I don't know why you think this is such an important point. Your parents paying for part of the cost of an extravagant bachelorette party for an entire week in another country is not relevant to your bridesmaids' behavior. Did the nice house mean they had to all fall in line? Unless your friends have unlimited vacation time from their jobs, no family obligations of their own, and can easily cover all of the costs that you describe (how much for the wedding itself?), consider that maybe not everyone was as excited as you expected them to be about this trip. They did it for you and you complained that they weren't attentive enough.", "It costs thousands and tbh you really don't want an official diagnosis of Autism. You can't immigrate anywhere you want, and other discrimination..", "I just got back from a 7-day Alaska cruise, and I spent a lot of afternoons lying in the bed of my cabin, staring out at the water, reading novels. \u263a\ufe0f I travel a lot, and one of my favorite parts of traveling is the afternoon nap.", "I'd agree with your interpretation, IF the scenario was that OP offered a vacation and this financial setup, and then when everyone arrived, then she dropped the bachelorette itinerary on them. However, this was a well planned and forethought trip. There was, as OP stated, about 8 months of pre-trip discussion, or at least it was started 8 months prior. The trip was for OP, that was the context, that was the intent. There is no \"feel obligated\". It was the entire reason for the trip. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I agree to go on a trip like that, and then I don't follow through and leave prepaid activities on the table and excise myself from the person the trip was planned around, I'm an asshole.", "If they didn\u2019t want to make the whole bachelorette party about the bride then they shouldn\u2019t have gone. Some people in this comment section are audacious af", "It doesn\u2019t matter how far in advance the trip was planned. What matters is OP\u2019s motivation for paying a large portion of the costs. If OP didn\u2019t tell her friends they wouldn\u2019t have the right to occasionally do their own thing on this trip, she can\u2019t get mad at her friends for not wanting to do everything she wanted to do. OP still got to do all of the planned activities on the trip so I don\u2019t get what the big deal is. Her friends chose not to be part of her entourage for one day, how did that take away from the purpose of the trip?", "I think it's audacious to assume a 7 day trip should be all about you, but that's just me. If it was 1 or 2 days, of course! And sometimes not going is easier said than done."]}
