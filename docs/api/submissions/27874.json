She's never put a label on her sexuality but she has said she's attracted to everyone. Ever since we were in high school, she'd often flirt with girls I was interested in. She'd also flirt with my friends when they'd come over to hang out. Sometimes Hailey would even come into my room without knocking just to talk to them. It was very uncomfortable and some of my friends even stopped coming over to my house because of it. This made me really angry and I told our parents (45M and 42F) but they'd always say I'm being homophobic and to leave her alone. So she'd always get away with it. A few months after she graduated, she moved out of the house and I haven't had to deal with her flirting with my friends anymore.  \nSeven months ago I met my now girlfriend 'Layla' (18F) and we really hit it off. We've been together a little over four months. One thing to note about Layla is that she's really shy, so she's never voices any concerns until after the fact. Well I really wanted her to meet my parents so we set up a quick dinner at a nice restaurant on Tuesday night. Without even telling me, my parent's invited Hailey (who was almost 30 minutes late). For the better part of the dinner, she would constantly flirt with my girlfriend. She'd give Layla compliments about her clothing, body, facial features, and even offer her number multiple times. My parent's would just laugh along with her antics saying it's just how she normally is. But I could clearly see Layla was uncomfortable so I paid my side of the bill and took her home.  \nWhen we got to her house, I asked if I could spend the night and she said yes. And that's where I've been for the past few days. My parents and Hailey have been blowing up my calling me all sorts of names, which has me thinking I was in the wrong. I haven't answered any of my sister's messages but I told my mom where I am. When I asked Layla about it she said the compliments were nice at first but she got uncomfortable.\n\nSo AITA for making a big deal out of my sister flirting with my girlfriend?\n\nETA: I didn't put my reasoning, sorry. My parents think I'm an asshole for ignoring my sister's messages, and an even bigger asshole for walking out of the restaurant. They say I was entitled and rude.

And it\u2019s awful that your parents are enabling this and saying you\u2019re homophobic for calling her out and trying to protect your gf. \n\nAs someone in the LGBT community, it terrifies me how often others in the community get away it. Calling out someone\u2019s harassment towards the same sex is NOT homophobia.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a creep and your parents are more than happy to turn a blind eye to her awful behavior.", "NTA\n\n>This made me really angry and I told our parents (45M and 42F) but they'd always say I'm being homophobic and to leave her alone.\n\nNo this isn't about being homophobic. Its about respecting peoples boundaries. These are your friends, not hers. Its polite to say hi but they came round your house because you asked. If she wants to hang out with them she can ask them directly not when they are over to see YOU.\n\nAlso very good job noticing your partner being uncomfortable and removing them from that situation.\n\n>They say I was entitled and rude.\n\nHow are you entitled? I get potentially rude but what?", "NTA\n\nHer not labelling her sexuality does not give her a free pass to flirt with everyone, especially your girlfriend. \n\nYour parents are 100% enabling this behaviour. It is not normal. It is weird and very intense; I can imagine it made your friends/ Layla feel very awkward. It's also kind of creepy.\n\nShe sounds like she gets off on trying to entice them away from you. You definitely need to try and set some boundaries with her if you can.", "NTA. Your sister is disrespecting your relationship, you, and your gf. Your parents just enable her behavior. How does she not realize she\u2019s making people uncomfortable and what kind of sibling flirts with their brother\u2019s partner. Smh. You\u2019re not the AH Op.", "Would your parents think it was so cute and harmless if you flirted with Hailey 's dates? I bet not. They need to rethink their position on their lecherous daughter. Her sexuality has nothing to do with it. NTA.", "So leaving the restaurant after your sister made your girlfriend uncomfortable and your parents laughing at it like it is some sort of joke is rude and entitled? Your sister is beyond entitled on the other hand. She is not owed a reply by you. and it is not rude to remove yourself and your girlfriend from a situation where you're being made to feel uncomfortable.  NTA.", "NTA you need to have a serious convo about your sister and her lack of boundaries or respect.", "Why is everyone who is so obviously NTA did nothing wrong, always convinced by their families who ARE the assholes, that they\u2019re assholes?! \n\nYou are NTA. I suggest if you still hang out with your sister, to cut her off at the start telling her to stop. Does she even know how to be nice and make casual conversation without flirting? She sounds hypersexual or something, nonstop with literally everyone for years.", "These are the very same people who will be calling you an AH when you distance yourself because of your sisters' antics and their lack of respect for you and your gf.\n\nThese are also the same people who would be overjoyed if your sister ever steals a significant other from you and label you an AH for not being happy for your sister.\n\nOP you do not, and I mean DO NOT have to accept this from anyone. Your sister should be ashamed of herself for this. Your parents also, for approving of such horrible behavior. They are the AH and butt hurt you wasn't down for the BS anymore. Until they get with the program continue to walk out and if it doesn't stop limit contact. NTA, but your folks are. EHHHHHH I'd hate ever bringing anyone around my sibling if they did this throughout my life.", "NTA. Your parents and your siter art the aholes, using homophobia to justify her childish/shitty behavior is so wrong and manipulating, some people just don't have boundaries.", "NTA!\n\nYour sister displayed creepy behaviour traits. It's one thing to flirt and be open but being flirty with your GF to the point of making her uncomfortable that's red flag behaviour right there.\n\nNot just your sister but your parents are TAs as well for not stopping your sister's advances and for calling you rude and entitled.\n\nIf I were you, I would go LC with your sister and if need be, parents too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister deserves to be called out on it, if your sister was a man doing those things people would be screaming sexual harassment. Gender/sexuality doesn\u2019t entitle you to pressure people and make them uncomfortable no matter what.", "NTA but it sounds like your sister is hypersexual, and could benefit from an evaluation. Coming on so strongly to everyone she meets is not healthy behavior.", "Wow! It's obvious who the Golden Child is in that family, and it's certainly not OP. The parents are AH for secretly inviting the flirtatious sister, who made a dramatic, late entrance so she could, once again, hit on her brother's date. Sister is chief AH in the bunch. You were good to remove your girlfriend from the awkward situation. Your family sucks, best go low contact with parents, no contact with domineering sister. And block parents if they continue to always side against you.", "It frustrated me a lot when my parents would use that excuse because it didn't have anything to do with her sexuality. It was just about her making me and my friends uncomfortable. It does make me sad though because we used to be pretty close until this all started happening. After she came out it just seemed to be her fall back when my friends wouldn't flirt with her.", "Thank you. My parent's always use the homophobic card whenever I would bring the issue up so it never really got talked about. I'm pretty sure they just didn't want to deal with the drama it caused.", "They told me I was entitled for inviting them out and then only paying mine and Layla's share when I left. They said I was rude for leaving before dinner was over.", "One thing I am very curious about is if this behavior is exclusively towards the people OP brings around as a weird act of jealousy/sabotage/whatever, or if she is like this towards anyone she finds attractive.\n\nBecause if it\u2019s the latter, one of these days she might upset the wrong person while her parents aren\u2019t around and be in for a very rude awakening.", "When her flirting first started, I tried talking to my parents about it, but they'd always tell me I was being homophobic and that I had to accept who she was. This is the only time I really put my foot down because I really care about Layla.", "Hailey has never been in a relationship long enough for them to meet our parents, which is why I think she has so much fun flirting with everyone. It just makes me angry when I can visibly see my friends and gf getting uncomfortable with it. A few told her to stop before but she didn't.", "Thank you.", "I've tried multiple times when it first started, but I'd always be told I'm being homophobic. That really bothered me because some of my closest friends are in the LGBT community.", "Gaslighting is a time honored and effective strategy used by assholes and creeps throughout history.", "It\u2019s time to not put up with it any longer and I\u2019d stand up to your parents on this as well, now that you are all adults. If they cannot respect you and your partner then you need to be firm, push back and set boundaries or put distance between them.", "Do you have any lgbt female friends yourself? You could always have one of them say something to Hailey, because then she can\u2019t claim homophobia.", "Sexuality has nothing to do with it. If your male brother was flirting with and hitting on your partner it would be just as gross and inappropriate", "Yeah you're all good in my eyes. \n\nIf I were to pay for a dinner for my parents. I wouldn't pay for theirs if they invited an additional person. I was hosting and I didn't invite them.", "Yes exactly. Seems a bit of a coincidence to me that it's OP's friends and partners. \n\nWould be interesting to know if it's anyone else, like if she's just stopping random people in the street!", "Good on you for sticking up for Layla. Now it\u2019s time for you to stick up for yourself. I\u2019m sorry that your parents overlook the extent of your sister\u2019s behavior. She\u2019s way out of line. Weird how she only picks your friends/gf to pick on, where\u2019s her relationship since she loves flirting so much. You need to be firm with your parents + sister. And you\u2019re not being homophobic. Your parents are enablers\ud83d\ude2d", "Hailey seems to enjoy the preliminary chase, more than an actual relationship. Very sad.", "F that\u2019s super difficult! It\u2019s hard to explain to parents and sister, but they need to imagine your sister as a heterosexual male.. maybe they\u2019d feel a different way if it was your Pervy brother creeping on your girlfriends. Sorry you\u2019re going through it, but glad you and your girl are all good. \n\nIt\u2019s also tough because your sister and you are pretty much the same age so i get the flirting with your friends, it\u2019s the boundary of creeping on your girlfriends that\u2019s a consistent red flag for me, especially if the girlfriend is uncomfortable by it. Some girlfriends would state directly to hailey that they are not interested.", "Hailey just seems to enjoy making people uncomfortable, she's not \"chasing\" her siblings partner"]}
