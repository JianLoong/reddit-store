She's never put a label on her sexuality but she has said she's attracted to everyone. Ever since we were in high school, she'd often flirt with girls I was interested in. She'd also flirt with my friends when they'd come over to hang out. Sometimes Hailey would even come into my room without knocking just to talk to them. It was very uncomfortable and some of my friends even stopped coming over to my house because of it. This made me really angry and I told our parents (45M and 42F) but they'd always say I'm being homophobic and to leave her alone. So she'd always get away with it. A few months after she graduated, she moved out of the house and I haven't had to deal with her flirting with my friends anymore.  \nSeven months ago I met my now girlfriend 'Layla' (18F) and we really hit it off. We've been together a little over four months. One thing to note about Layla is that she's really shy, so she's never voices any concerns until after the fact. Well I really wanted her to meet my parents so we set up a quick dinner at a nice restaurant on Tuesday night. Without even telling me, my parent's invited Hailey (who was almost 30 minutes late). For the better part of the dinner, she would constantly flirt with my girlfriend. She'd give Layla compliments about her clothing, body, facial features, and even offer her number multiple times. My parent's would just laugh along with her antics saying it's just how she normally is. But I could clearly see Layla was uncomfortable so I paid my side of the bill and took her home.  \nWhen we got to her house, I asked if I could spend the night and she said yes. And that's where I've been for the past few days. My parents and Hailey have been blowing up my (edit:phone) calling me all sorts of names, which has me thinking I was in the wrong. I haven't answered any of my sister's messages but I told my mom where I am. When I asked Layla about it she said the compliments were nice at first but she got uncomfortable.\n\nSo AITA for making a big deal out of my sister flirting with my girlfriend?\n\nETA: I didn't put my reasoning, sorry. My parents think I'm an asshole for ignoring my sister's messages, and an even bigger asshole for walking out of the restaurant. They say I was entitled and rude. Does this make me TA?\n\nEdit #2: Thank you so much to everyone who commented, since there's a lot of you in such a short time. Any advice given is greatly appreciated even if I can't reply to them all. I'm going to message my parent's later tonight and let them know I'll be going no contact with them until both of them and my sister apologise to my girlfriend. I'll also be mentioning how Hailey's behaviour is sexual harassment and that they're enabling her. Whether they apologise or not is up to them, but I refuse to let my gf go without one.

Regardless of gender sister has crossed into sexual harassment. This is 2023, same as men, women can be charged or get beaten up for unwanted harassment. Before this happens, she needs to learn to understand the word no, same as they taught you. Being bi and and a woman is no protection or excuse in a gender equal society. Tell them you love her and are upset at how risky her behaviour is and how  it\u2019s escalating.

Point out she is getting a reputation as someone to avoid as she doesn\u2019t understand when a person is feeling uncomfortable and says no to being inappropriately touched or harassed for their phone number. No one wants to get physically involved in stopping her, but  chances  are sooner or later she will accost the wrong person and they will fight back physically to protect themselves. For her safety, she has to learn to read body language and to understand that no means stop, back off, quit asking for attention both physically and verbally.\n\nAnother response\nApproach a relative with the issue, forward this text to them first and ask for their opinion on how to stop her? Approach with the concern that she is going to get herself charged or jumped  by someone at some point if it keeps escalating. Ask this relative to approach your parents and maybe sister with you.\n\nParents don\u2019t like to think of their children as having inappropriate creepy behaviour, so this may not work but your conscience will be clear.

When/if your parents ask why they don\u2019t see your friends anymore, say they refuse to come over because of sister\u2019s sexual harassment. Not because of her being bi, but because she ignores the word no and being told they aren\u2019t interested in dating her. They won\u2019t meet anyone.

I was in a telegram group, and there was a gay guy who constantly flirted with a straight guy. I privately messaged the straight guy and asked if he was uncomfortable, and he said he was. So I called the gay guy on it and basically got yelled at and told I just didn't understand the group's dynamic. \n\nYea, sure. The group's dynamic of sexual harassment, right? The guy being harassed doesn't stick up for himself cause he doesn't want to upset anyone. It's sad how some people are.", "Dude I am a super flirty person and I would NEVER flirt with my siblings partners or their friends without an established friendly relationship.

Or even if they didn't, the self hate is real) \n\nBasically most people who do bad things have had bad things happen to them, or are compensating for some insecurity. This doesn't excuse the action but given you guys had a good relationship and you have some interest in repairing it, acknowledging that she might be acting out in some way could actually encourage an apology\n\nAlso, acknowledging that you miss what you two had, and letting her know that an apology and change in her behavior could repair things between you two...\n\n\nSuch as:\n\n \"I'm your brother and miss how close we were before you started driving me away with this behavior. I wish you could acknowledge it and apologize so that maybe our relationship could be repaired. I know Mom and Dad are hesitant to call out the behavior for fear of seeming homophobic. Actually, I think it's more homophobic to ignore it and act like women can't sexually harass people or like women being creepy to other women is less serious than men being creepy to women. But, I do understand that maybe you have some reason for behaving the way you do, even if it's not right. I have empathy if you're compensating for some insecurity or the invisibility of living in a heterosexist world, or...I don't know.
