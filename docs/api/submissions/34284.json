We\u2019ve known each other since 2nd grade, and I love her a lot.

They met at work, when Liz was working at Five Guys and Tim was her manager. At the time, I was also 18 and extremely naive, so while I thought the age gap was a bit strange, I trusted her judgement. I never met him personally until the beginning of 2022, since Liz is a very private person. (Though she did mention he said \u201cI love you\u201d a couple months after they got together, and that they started being intimate after that.) I thought he was loud and obnoxious, and I resolved not to see him again.\r\n\nThis worked until the beginning of 2023, when Liz told me they broke up. Through her sadness, Liz revealed that during their relationship Tim had made sexist comments (\u201cwomen have it a lot easier than men these days\u201d), doubted her bisexuality (\u201chow can you be attracted to women if you have me\u201d), started smoking and done a lot of drugs. But those weren\u2019t the breaking point; apparently, Liz\u2019s friend had sent her proof that Tim had been cheating on her for over six months, and that was the act that finally got her to leave. This left me very disgusted at Tim, and glad that Liz had gotten away.\r\n\nFor about 6 months, all was fine, until one day I was staying at her place, and she suddenly said Tim was dropping by. I was shocked, and asked her why. All she said was that they were \u201cstill friends\u201d. That entire evening, he was very touchy with her, i.e. hugging her constantly, snuggling with her on the sofa and getting her to sit in his lap. This left me very uncomfortable and worried for her, but she maintained they were broken up. They ended up getting back together by the end of the month, with Liz claiming Tim gave proof that he never cheated on her at all. I\u2019ve got no idea how he managed it.\r\n\nSkip to a month ago, I\u2019d organized a dinner with my friends. But when I was only 10 minutes away, Liz told us (she didn\u2019t ask, and I never invited him) that Tim would be joining us. For me, the evening was instantly ruined. We should have been catching up, but suddenly the evening was about Tim\u2019s unfunny jokes, loud interruptions and explicit jokes about him and Liz\u2019s intimate life. He even asked everyone for their ages, and upon discovering two of us were younger than Liz, joked \u201cI don\u2019t feel so bad about dating you anymore.\u201d\r\n\nNow my birthday is coming up, and I want to invite everyone out for dinner, including Liz. However, I really don\u2019t want to risk Tim appearing again with no warning. I want to tell Liz I don\u2019t want him there, but it feels like an AH thing to do.

There's no way to stop him from entering a public place, even if he sits across the room and glares at you for your whole dinner.\n\nPerhaps you could have the dinner catered in your home, or a friend's home, and make sure that no one lets him come inside.
