When we had our child we only dated briefly and I moved to my current state with in one year of being born. I\u2019m still a very active father and we have a relatively smooth understanding of our situation now. About five months back me and my Ex happened to hook up during a weekend I spent while gathering our child for my time. Two months later, she informed me that she is pregnant. I wasn\u2019t necessarily disappointed about this but of course I wasn\u2019t ecstatic either. I did let her know that I would want a DNA test as she said it was mine, but due to how much distance there is, I don\u2019t know if I can fully trust it and I\u2019m sure she has \u201cfriends\u201d as we don\u2019t hook up regularly at all. Well three days ago, we received the results from the prenatal DNA test, and the child is determined to be mine. I figured we would adjust our custody with the new baby once it comes but today she dropped a bomb on me. She informed me that she wanted to give up custodial rights to the new baby and I raise it as my own while we continue to have a coparenting relationship for our first child. I told her this was absolutely ridiculous because I would still have to make arrangements for our first child while leaving our new child out which can cause a lot of challenges and heartbreak in their future. She then informed me that if I didn\u2019t want to accept this arrangement she would actually put the baby up for adoption as she did not want to be a full-time mother again. I am hurt by this because I don\u2019t see a way out of it. If she decides to give up her rights I am absolutely still going to take on my child but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that she\u2019ll have to give up the rights to her first child. To give her credit she is an amazing mother and I know she was not planning to have a child at this time but I feel like there\u2019s so many complications that can come with this dynamic.  I told her if she gives up her rights to the new baby I will fight her in court to get full custody of our first child as well to lessen the complication. She informed me that she would fight back and I can either except or do what I need in court . Again to give her credit. She\u2019s an amazing mother to our first child. I\u2019m just really at a loss of what I could or should even do here. Neither of us planned for this child and I\u2019ve never wanted to force parenthood on anyone but I feel like this is such a tough situation.  Give up neither or Both  !
