So when they want to throw a big party (birthdays, holidays, just because) they just go ahead and use my home. I have no problem with this, since we dont use it often (it still has rooms that need to be remodeled), and also as I married into a big family, and it makes sense to use our home.  Now, my issue is, I don't like the smell of cigarette smoke. And ALL the men, and some women in the family smoke. That's fine, cool, do whatever you want, no judgment. Just do it outside. \n\nThe event was at 9:30am, and we didn't get there until 11, because I have a baby. I walk in to the smell of cigarette smoke, and see at LEAST 9 people smoking at the breakfast table. I say nothing, continue on with the event, and sit with my baby by the fireplace. People come and go, and some decide to stop by the fireplace, & light up a cigarette. At this point I'm visibly annoyed, and they see it. \n\nI later see my mom and MIL sitting together chatting, so I asked my MIL why she's allowing her guests to smoke, to which both of the moms reply \"oh, don't get mad, you can't really stop anyone from smoking, and it would be rude to tell them to go out into the cold.\" I'm not asking anyone to stop smoking, I'm just asking that they don't smoke indoors. And I get it, it's a party, they're eating, drinking, dancing...so I get wanting to smoke. But I cannot fathom someone walking into someone else's house, and without asking, lighting up a damn cigarette. So I told them that if that's how they see it, I can't continue allowing events at my home if they (my inlaws, as my parents have never used my home, they use their own) cannot enforce that 1 rule I ask of them. They both said that what I said was shameful, that I was being an asshole, and that I should say nothing to keep the peace, since it's not my place to speak because these aren't my guests.
