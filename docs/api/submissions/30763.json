They knew how much time, money, and effort you put in and I doubt they made any offers to repay you, correct?", ">Am I the asshole for not attending the wedding.\n\nNTA. She changed her mind about you being her MOH after you've done so much for her and spent so much money, so you get to change your mind about attending the wedding. Simple as that.\n\nINFO. Did she give you a reason for why she asked you to step down?", "I N F O: did you ask anyone to financially compensate you after you were asked to step down? This feels like a gross bait-and-switch.\n\nEdit NTA this is some bullshit.", "  \nNTA  \nGirl, you are so not the A-hole here! You poured your heart and cash into making your bestie's wedding epic, and then she pulls a switcheroo on you? That's majorly messed up. Of course, you're hurt and upset! It's not about being a drama queen; it's about being treated with respect after all you've done. Her family and friends need to see the bigger picture instead of calling you out. Stand your ground, girl, and let them know you're hurt, not just causing drama. You deserve better vibes! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc94", "NTA but I\u2019d bill her for everything I paid for. She essentially used you to fulfill the duties and when it was all done gave the position to someone else. Send her an invoice.", "NTA. Being blindsided like that would be really tough on anyone. And it was really uncool of your friend to do that to you. She clearly knew her future SIL and still asked you to be her MOH. To change that up last minute is not only uncool, it\u2019s insulting. It would be one thing if you weren\u2019t taking your MOH roll seriously, but that\u2019s clearly not the case here. \n\nAll that being said, I would highly encourage you to talk to your friend. You two have been best friends for over 2 decades and not going to her wedding would likely cause permanent damage to the relationship. I\u2019m not saying you need to go, just that a relationship like that deserves another, much more calm discussion where you two can have a heart to heart and express how you both feel in a non-judgmental way. \n\nHer SIL becoming the MOH at the end sounds like it\u2019s likely coming from her future in laws family, and less from her, so it\u2019s possible she\u2019s being pressured into it. But obviously I\u2019m lacking more context to be able to fully claim that. Really hope things work out for the better. Good luck!", "Nta She did you dirty. You don't swap MOH or best man. Unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nBride is a dick for springing this on you so close to the wedding.\n\nNo doubt shes being pressured into this, but the least she could do was confide in you about the real reason for this last minute change.\n\nNow all she has is drama and the loss of her best (?) friend.\n\nSorry.", "NTA. It is rude of your friend to go back on her decision, especially after you had already done so much for her and spent so much money. You can apologize for the things you said in anger, but the cause of the conflict clearly lies with your friend.", "NTA.  All the time and money you spent. No way would I go and the Friendship would be over.", "NTA. I probably would have quietly walked away from both the wedding and from our friendship. That was a nasty, hurtful thing to do. The bride was no doubt under a lot of pressure from her family to have SIL in the wedding, but she should have stood up for you and say it wasn't fair as you had already spent a fortune on your MOH duties. \n\nDid they still want you to be in the wedding as a bridesmaid? Was SIL originally asked to be bridesmaid?", "So the bride used you as her unpaid wedding planner, your out of pocket money for a bachelorette party, did you pay for the MOH dress in addition? That since you are being demoted you won\u2019t be allowed to wear or are you supposed to hand over the dress to the SIL also without reimbursement? Respond on SM to her and all her flying monkeys everything you\u2019ve listed here and then go NC with this person who is clearly not your friend. I\u2019m so sorry and quite offended by her treatment of you. NTA", "NTA kinda sounds like they used you because they knew you made the most money. or I should say, the story is framed in a way that gives that vibe.", "NTA. I'm sorry hon but that's not your best friend. Do you know her parents? I would ask for at least some money back and be done with her.", "So I have been a bridesmaid in 5 weddings since 2020. I have to ask:\n\n>I spent nearly $700 on her Bachelorette party, buying cute outfits for everyone and renting a party bus with all you can drink drinks. The other girls pitched in but I'm the most finicially stable so the majority fell on me.\n\nWhy would you do this? Every bridal party I have been a part of, the bride is in the loop just enough in case there are any issues (e.g. \"We can't go far, Stacey just lost her job and can't afford to fly right now\") and then the MOH comes up with plans and then sends out to make sure everyone can split and afford it. You absolutely should not have been covering for other people. Kind of set up for resentment, there.\n\nINFO: Did she say why her MOH had to change so suddenly and last minute? What did you say during the argument? You're not including a lot of details.\n\nYou're not an asshole for being hurt at all, that's extraordinarily shitty. I'm just wondering if there were some family/in-law politics at play?", "NTA  \nYou went all out for your bestie, dropped serious cash, and poured your heart into making her wedding dreams come true. Then, out of the blue, she kicks you to the curb? That's messed up! Of course, you're upset, who wouldn't be? And now everyone's acting like you're the bad guy? Nah, sis, you're totally justified in feeling hurt and pissed off.", "INFO: Did the bride say why the SIL was taking over?  I'm leaning NTA since it sounds like the bride was taking advantage of your time, effort, and money, but if she was getting pressure from the groom's family then maybe it was \"just\" a coincidence.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou got used and now you are being insulted. Should you go, you would be angry and leave early. What then is the point.   \n\n\nDo not go. Do not contribute anything as you already have.", "NTA get your money back and break away.", "INFO: you've left out all the details about the conflict. Did she give a reason for why she wanted to change things? What did she say and what did you say?\n\nWas there ANYTHING at all that might be related here?\n\nAt 29, I would expect her to be pretty aware of social conventions, especially if she was aware enough about the MOH throwing the bachelorette party and so on. So just assigning the role to someone else at the last minute seems like there is a story there.", "NTA she had you do all the grunt work, then SIL swoop in for the fun part. That\u2019s just wrong.", "NTA. Imho, don\u2019t try to get your money back. $1k is a very cheap price for that bullet. Let it go and cut this nice bride forever.", "NTA \nThey must pay you back, this is revolting. And how they all attack you like this & belittle you, yikes. I would have cut contact honestly. \nExpecting that someone else should pay that kind of money and no one else and kick them down, no just no. Really shows their true colours, especially since they dont wanna pay you back.", "NTA in any way, shape, or form!   No way I would attend after this.   The bride is not your friend\u2026.she\u2019s the AH, not you", "Why are they so stuck in gender roles? If it is so important to grooms family, why can\u2019t she be \u201cbest woman\u201d and stand for groom?\nnTA", "NTA\n\nShe used you. This was the plan all along. \n\nIf you paid deposits, get your money  back. Skip the wedding.", "NTA. If I were you, I think I would just own it. Say something like: You're right. I do need to get over it. I was way too excited about (Bride)'s wedding. I invested far too much time, emotion and money in helping to create her perfect day. Then I discover that she's not worth it. I should have seen that ahead of time. Now I need to get over it. Thanks for bringing that to my attention.", "Here's the big problem...you built up the MOH role in your mind, embraced it, and then proceeded to expend a lot of money in good faith based on that role.  You've now had that role taken from you suggesting you're no longer a tight friend as well as being out of the money.  I think the only real remaining question is how close were she and future SIL before this drama unfolded?  Was she super close, getting there, or did she capitulate to her fiance/or his family's pressure?\n\nDon't go if it bothers you...but know full well this likely means the end of your friendship and potentially damages any co-friendships the two of you share.\n\nSince you sort of asked...I wouldn't go.  She obviously doesn't think of you as close a friend as you hold her.  In the end...I personally think it's in incredibly poor tasted and a crappy thing to do to abandon you so near the wedding.", "NTA. Tell them to pay you back. Your so-called \"best friend\" is massive AH though. \n\nIf I were you, I would step down and cut ties with all of them.", "What\u2019s her reasoning? Is it something cheesy but (kind of) understandable like the families are coming together so they\u2019ve chosen to SIL to be MOH?\n\nStill NTA as even if that is the case she should have explained but interested to know", "Whoa. This really feels like you were used in a big way. I would consider attending as a guest only and ducking out early but that\u2019s even being more gracious that the situation calls for.", "NTA. \n\nAnd if you can, I would cancel the bachelorette party, if you can get your money back. Tell the new MoH she can plan something", "NTA. Ask for the money back. She literally used you to fund everything and as soon as it was done, she didn't need you anymore.", "NTA", "Send her a bill for all that you spent see what happens.", "NTA. Good riddance to her and everyone else who is telling you that you are a DRAMA QUEEN. The girl used you and made you do everything for her. I hope it was worth it for her to take advantage of her best friend and lose that relationship. Who tells someone to drop down as MOH two weeks before the wedding? It's crazy that you still call her your best friend it should be your ex-best friend. I wouldn't be surprised if this was planned between the bride and groom's family all along. Regardless, don't go. I wouldn't give her the satisfaction and allow me to look like a fool at the end of the day. I would tell everyone to stop contacting me as it is harassment and block them all, and then I would plan a fun away weekend for myself during the wedding. It isn't about you, so you are recusing yourself from the wedding and the friendship. She's pathetic. I'm also petty LOL. I would quickly find and retrieve receipts for everything wedding-related and invoice her. You were her unpaid bridal planner. She has to reimburse you for your services and yes my behind would take things legally. Not everyone is me though. Get rid of trash people in your life who show no regard for you. She showed you who she is and how little she values you. Leave her in the past.", "NTA I\u2019d be angry too. You\u2019re not creating drama but being treated disrespectfully. The people criticizing you think it\u2019s just about being the first bridesmaid down the aisle etc.. They\u2019re not understanding the work and money you\u2019ve already put into this as MOH. \n\nIt is a shame she is caving to pressure from fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family. My in-laws did speak to my husband to make sure my SIL was a bridesmaid, but if my husband\u2019s family had asked me to make her MOH, I would\u2019ve told them all to go pound sand. \n\nI would try to have a calmer heart to heart with her one more time. Besides pointing out how hurtful and unfair this is of you, try to get her to see if she lets her in-laws push her around on this issue, they will continue to meddle in her and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s lives dictating their preferences on them. She needs to nip that in the bud. \n\nOnly you can decide what to do after a calmer discussion. If you get a sense she\u2019s under a lot of pressure from in-laws and feels awful about doing this, I\u2019d at least give it some thought about still going. If she\u2019s being insensitive and acting like this is no big deal, and you have no right to be upset, then I\u2019d probably not go. Edit: And end the friendship or at least go extremely low contact. \n\nI do think whether you refuse to go, or are extremely gracious and accept being demoted to bridesmaid, your friend will regret this someday.", "NTA & you\u2019re letting them get away with a lot. I would call & see if you could cancel some stuff & tell her that her new MOH can help her now", "NTA - clearly got used and now they\u2019re gaslighting you to your friends.", "INFO: did she explain why she was dropping you? Were you demoted or removed from the wedding party? Did she ask you to spend all that money? Have you asked for reimbursement?", "NTA. You also deserve your money back.", "It honestly blows my mind how much people spend on bachelor/bachelorette parties.", "NTA. That means you did all the work, paid for all the stuff, and she did....what? No. If my BF \"thanked\" me like that? A real friend wouldn't toss you away like that.", "NTA. Your so called friend used you for time and money. She was always going to have her future SIL be the MOH. But she knew that her SIL couldn\u2019t be a MOH like you could. The bride is a shitty friend and you should send her a bill for your services. She\u2019s a user big time. You aren\u2019t a drama queen or money hungry. They are huge AHs. Friends don\u2019t treat friends like this.", "Time to find a new best friend.", "Did she ask you to still be a bridesmaid?  If so it's only a title let it go. Everyone knew you did all the stuff.   This isn't a royal wedding. \n\nIt's his family pressuring her.", "Hey OP? Before you 100% burn a bridge here, consider the very outside chance that her in-laws are beginning the subtle process of isolating her and erasing her support system by eliminating friends in favor of their family, a future move that takes them closer to his family and away from hers. There may be a time a few years in the future when she needs you for a ride and die escape plan but is too embarrassed to ask for help because you got offended now and burned the bridge. Be offended. Don\u2019t burn the bridge.", "I would be publicly posting all of those private messages from SIL on social media. I would then say.

Paramount to decision on whether you are the AH. Based on what you provided,  you are not. Her retraction is clearly very painful to you. And I am sorry to see that happen to anyone. Hang in there.", "NTA- it feels a bit fishy that after you did so much work and spent so much money, time and energy you\u2019d just be pulled from the position so close to the wedding day. That is no best friend of yours and if you have to step down you\u2019d have to be compensated for your time money and efforts. \n\nIt\u2019s shady that they waited until the work was \u201cdone \u201c to make a decision like that.

She used you for your money. So did her sister in law.", "NTA- It\u2019s very unlikely your friendship will be the same after this. Give it couple days and meet in person at a public place. It\u2019s very inconsiderate for her to ask you after you have spent so much time and money. If she can\u2019t agree then don\u2019t go.

They took your time, money and effort then when all the work was done replaced you with the sil. \n\nHate to say it but I think this might have been the plan all along and they either didn't trust sil to do the work or just knew you'd do it better, so used you until they'd got what they wanted.", "NTA. What you need to ask yourself is:\n\n1, did you give all these people your phone number?\n2, if not, what sort of \"friend\" does that make her?\n3, is it really worth feeling unhappy about how she's treating you?", "So clearly, OP, you are NTA.\n\nHowever, I don't know if the bride is the asshole here either. You don't really know why she made this change, and she may be unwilling to discuss it in detail at this point in the wedding planning.\n\nIf you want to keep this person as a friend, take your new role as a bridesmaid, write off all the expenses as a wedding gift, and sit down with her a few weeks after the wedding to talk it over. \n\nI speculate that her fiance's family has been pressuring her to give over wedding party spots to their family. If so, she may be between a rock and a hard place, and was hoping you would \"take a dive\" so that she didn't end up on the rocks with her new husband's family. It's shitty, but she may be reacting out of desperation rather than malice.", "NTA but if you do end up going, just go as a guest. Enjoy the party.

Is that why you got so upset? \n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nTo me, this is an \"actions have consequences\" scenario. \n\nIs the bride entitled to change her MOH in this scenario: sure. \n\nIs she entitled to zero blowback making the change after all her supposed best friend had already done in the MOH role? No. \n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see it as the OP being asking to carry the burden of \"keeping the peace\" without her consent. That's not main character syndrome as the family texts suggest, that's just not wanting to get dumped on. Those people don't give a fuck about the OP, they're just upset that the bride is upset.", "On the question at hand - are you AH if you don\u2019t attend the wedding - then yes, sadly you are.  This is a 20-year friendship and not attending it will nuke it.  There is something happening behind the scenes that you are not seeing.  Your friend is likely being pressured by her future in-laws to choose SIL as MOH.  That her marriage is going to get off on such an awkward start portends a possible future of emotional abuse and control.  She will need your support at some point in the future.\n\nYou have a right to be upset but let yourself calm down and reach out to your friend to find out what\u2019s really going on.  Then celebrate her day.", "NTA. You need to get a new friend.", "I really think there is more to this.  Did she remove you completely from being a bridesmaid or usher?  That said, without more details, I think not attending the wedding is a nuclear bomb too far on your friendship.", "So by the numbers the BF shouldn't have asked OP to be MOH if she wasn't absolutely sure. There are plenty of family politic reasons for having to have the future SIL be the MOH, so I get the ask but that is still on the bride here. Then OP got lost in their feelings and it became an argument rather than going \"OK. Here's what I expect to be reimbursed for, when can I hand off the work I've completed?\".\n\nESH. I'd say 60/40 leaning toward the bride on this one.\n\nEdit: Just read the \"money hungry\" post from OP and this is sounding more like a shakedown from a \"friend\". ESH 80/20 unless the story evolves.", "I\u2019m gonna go with ESH. Oddly enough, I\u2019ve been in both of y\u2019all\u2019s shoes. At my wedding, I named a family member to be my MOH, while my best friend really did all the usual MOH work behind the scenes. I did this WELL in advance though and never had any expectation of help from my friend (I hired a wedding planner, hired vendors myself, and took care of invitations and everything.) She didn\u2019t need to do anything and the stuff she helped with was because she wanted to. Mostly my friend helped with the bach and day-of stuff. And man, I was so grateful she was there. \n\nOn the flip side, I\u2019ve now been a bridesmaid at two weddings where the brides chose not to name a MOH at all. But duties do not get distributed evenly among bridesmaids even when there\u2019s no MOH. And in both cases, I was the one planning (and paying for) the bach, helping with wedding planning (not to the extent you\u2019ve described), and managing day-of logistics, comforting the brides, etc. so I kinda get feeling unappreciated in those circumstances.\n\nBut you know what? For one thing, I never took on what you took on as a bridesmaid, and as a bride, I\u2019d NEVER have let one of my bridesmaids (MOH or otherwise) take on that level of work. I cannot understand why your friend would do this except to take advantage of your free labor. Even if you offered to do it, it\u2019s an inappropriate level of time and effort for a wedding that\u2019s not yours. I think she\u2019s an AH for letting you go above and beyond MOH duties and then pulling the rug out from under you. That\u2019s not okay and I would suggest that y\u2019all don\u2019t have the type of relationship you seemed to believe you had. \n\nBut for another, I never said a damn thing to the brides about not being MOH and my friend never said a damn thing to me before, on or even after my wedding day. Because weddings are not about the MOH, they are about the couple getting married. \n\nGiven what I know about weddings, neither of you handled this well. And you, especially, need to re-evaluate your friendship with the bride and set healthier boundaries for yourself.", "YTA. This is petty. Do sit down and tell her how you feel (without fighting\u2014just get it said), and then shut up and go to the wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right to wait until the emotions have calmed down never talking with your friend about it, especially if there is a possibility that she has been pressured into it.  I note you haven\u2019t said that the bride hasn\u2019t messaged you, just other friends, her family and her SIL.\n\nYou are understandably very hurt and angry and you have been treated appallingly, but until you get to the bottom of why this has happened, don\u2019t make any big decisions based on emotion.\n\nThis is, up until now, your best friend that you were inseparable from for most of your life.  Has anything like this happened before?  Has your friend been a friend to you in the past (it sounds like she might have as you mentioned paying your rent when you needed help)?  Have you been there for each other when needed? Is the friendship worth throwing away without knowing why?\n\nBest friends are gold and count amongst the most important relationships you can have, but like all relationships, they can occasionally need work, and they sometimes run their course as you become different people.\n\nIf you can put your hurt to one side, go to the wedding as a guest and celebrate her day as close to how you would have before this happened.  \n\nOnce the wedding is done and the dust is settled, talk to your friend, try to remain calm and explain how much it hurt you to be replaced, especially at the last minute after you had done so much as MOH.  Depending on what she says, you can decide whether to remain friends or walk away.", "Kjmmll", "Hmmmm. This feels ridiculous. Like you\u2019re leaving something out or distorting the truth. Why do you need clarification if yta or not? Seems like a no-brainer. I feel like maybe you\u2019re in denial of something and you need reassurance that you did nothing wrong? My guess is you went out of your way to be favored by the bride, and that maybe you took a little too much control of the wedding, more insisting that you take care of all the details more so than the bride genuinely relying or wanting/needing you to do these things for her. Reminds me of living with a roommate who spends all his/her extra energy cleaning the kitchen and taking out the trash, constantly, before someone else can even do it, so that they then feel as though they can rant and rave and make demands whenever they want or else everyone else sucks for not appreciating what said roommate does for everyone else.\n\nEdit: Further more, if you are being honest and transparent about the situation, then in 20 years you would have seen this girl\u2019s true colors.

This is a nonstarter. \n\nIf they refuse, put it out there for the world to know what a self-center little worm SIL thinking she can ask you to foot HER bill. Don\u2019t mention the friend other than to say she asked you to step down. It\u2019s not worth blowing that up as you don\u2019t know what kind of pressure she\u2019s been receiving from him or his family.", "that\u2019s because most people don\u2019t switch out their MOH at the last minute. it\u2019s not like you knew she was going to do that, so of course you didn\u2019t tell her it was conditional. but that\u2019s how it should be. nobody would spend tons of money on something if they knew they would be swapped out. im sorry your best friend is being so shitty to you. \ud83d\ude1e", "If you're in the US, you might want to brighten her day with a small claim lawsuit.  You had an agreement.  You would be the MOH in her wedding, and in exchange, you were expected to pay for certain things.  She pulled out of her end of the deal after you spent the money.  Odds are, you can get that back, especially if you kept receipts.  Your friend stole from you, possibly knowing the entire time that she intended to do it.", "She did not tell you that being made of honor was conditional either.  Conditional upon her whim.\n\nFrom what you say, you were her richest friend. Even if she considered you a friend, your relative wealth was an important factor in her deciding to be your friend and the only reason she asked you to be the MOH. She obtained your services and financial assistance under false pretenses. She is a fraudster and probably lacks the self-awareness to know who she really is.\n\nShe has never liked you as much as she has pretended, even to herself, to like you. Because she has never really valued your friendship, she can't understand why you would be so hurt at this negating of it.  I would feel very hurt and used if I were you.  I wouldn't want anything else to do with her ever again. Don't send a gift and don't explain yourself to her family. They have to choose her -- even if they think she was wrong.  Good riddance to people like her.", "I would just not get them any wedding gift at this point and if asked, say that the bachelorette was her gift.", "I mean yes it's conditional, but from the other side: you didn't volunteer the money just because she was your friend, but because she'd asked you to shoulder a specific role that comes with expectations. You fulfilled the expectations of hard work/money, and she yanked the rug from under you and told you that you'd done all this just for someone else to effectively get the public credit.", "Did you make these plans with her in the loop or did you do it all on your own? The way you went about this makes no sense to me as someone who has been in many weddings as a bridesmaid.", "Talk to each of the bridesmaids individually and let them know what happened and ask them to pay their share. Also reach out to SIL asking her to pay you since it was her financial responsibility. Basically, reach out to everyone else. At minimum, everyone will realize what a user she is and maybe some of the people will send you money to offset your losses.", "You don\u2019t know if those people were told the truth or a story about why you are no longer the MOH.

I\u2019m sorry you lost a friend.", "That is tacky. Why do people feel the need to get involved in a problem that's between two people? Grown ass adults acting like they are still in high school. \n\nIt's nothing to do with them, but they just love drama, so they are stirring.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t even call her for coffee to talk it out.  At first I also wondered if the family was pressuring her, but the excuse that an 18 year old might never be a maid of honour is pretty weak. I believe a close friend would be extremely apologetic when asking you to step down and would mention the pressure she getting from the family.  But she didn\u2019t.  And when you didn\u2019t fold as she thought you would, she accused you of being money hungry and is getting everyone to send you nasty messages.  You feel bad for saying some choice things to her but it sounds like she started it when you gave some rightful pushback.", "Going forward, just settle debts with cash. It\u2019s so much less complicated.", "I think you need to talk to your friend a little more, especially if you\u2019ve been close for this long and and she\u2019s never shown mean tendencies before.\n\nSeems like she spotted your rent in college and never even asked for it back, so she doesn\u2019t seem like a non genuine friend.", "Forget the money and walk away.

It\u2019s possible she\u2019s feeling like she has to keep that outspoken and stubborn part of her held down for the sake of relationship with her new in laws. That being said, I still absolutely disagree with her choice. The MOH, just like the BM, is supposed to be the person outside of your future spouse that you rely on the most and have the strongest relationship with. It\u2019s not meant to be someone you wouldn\u2019t normally pick in order to appease others. She chose you because you two are best friends. My best friend was my BM at my wedding. My wife\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t even on my groomsman list, because we weren\u2019t close. In my personal opinion, your friend\u2019s future SIL should be a bridesmaid at best. But, that\u2019s my opinion. I hope you two are able to work it out", "NTA, but you should have a talk with her when you are less emotional.  It feels like she was using you, but reality she was pressured and she chose her fianc\u00e9 family pressure over you.  She\u2019s been your friend too long to skip her wedding.  What\u2019s missing is that she really owes you a huge apology for what\u2019s she\u2019s done\u2026 and fianc\u00e9 family should also realize that this was cruel towards you as well\n\nEdit to add\u2026 depending on what exactly you said, it\u2019s likely you owe her an apology as well", "Why couldn\u2019t she just have two maids of honor?", "Stress shows peoples character.

Usually alterations are done more in advance and if store or bride has it I would be questioning if this wasn\u2019t the plan in place for a while because two weeks is really late to do the alterations.", "I know it is hard to part from a long time friend, but you shouldn't prioritize the feelings of someone that didn't care about your feelings.\n\nEven if she was pressured by her in-laws, she didn't give you the actual reason why she is changing MOH and instead told you some BS. She used you then discarded you, she proved she isn't your friend anymore.", "Brides and apparently pregnant women for some reason", "Sorry but this is bullshit\u2026 you make your sil a bridesmaid as the pity move, not the MOH. And especially not right before the wedding after your \u201cbest friend\u201d has poured time and money into your wedding unless something egregious has happened. You have to wonder was this the plan all along since SIL obviously wouldn\u2019t have had the financial means to do what you\u2019ve done for the wedding. Heavy NTA. \n\nIf I were you, I would feel completely taken advantage of and incredibly hurt. I think you really need to consider are you hurt enough that you\u2019re willing to end the friendship, bc that is what skipping the wedding will essentially do. \nQuestion: is this a pattern for the bride? Have you seen her use others in the past?", "NTA -It'd be one thing if SIL was added to the bridal party, as a bridesmaid. Replacing you as MOH after all you've done and spent? Hell no.\n\nIt's sad, but time to write her off. If you want to be petty add up all the expenses and send her a bill. Not that you should expect repayment, it would be just to make a point.", "I\u2019m in no way defending here. I\u2019m also VERY stubborn, and when I know what I want, it\u2019s a pretty insurmountable task to get me to change my mind (if it\u2019s harming someone else, that\u2019s totally different). \n\nI can kind of understand making a decision to include future family, or to appease them, to keep the peace, or start things off on a \u201cgood\u201d foot with the new family. \n\nHowever, and it\u2019s a big one, I wouldn\u2019t do my best friend dirty like that. Personally, I\u2019d have asked you to coffee or lunch, explained that it\u2019s not what I want, but I\u2019m trying to give a little. I\u2019d also have offered, unprompted, to reimburse you for anything you spent/wanted me to. \n\nThe only advice I have is to have a conversation with your friend, after a little time has passed, and everyone has calmed down. Then based on her response, adjust your friendship expectations to suit.\n\nAs for the peanut gallery. They very well may have been lied to, or only given partial truth. It\u2019s up to you if you want to set the record straight.

She ignored all of my mom\u2019s opinions but went out of her way to make her in laws happy even though my parents paid for the entire wedding and her in laws paid for nothing. \n\nI\u2019m saying this to defend your friend. What she did was totally wrong. I\u2019m just saying that marriage sometimes causes people to behave in way they wouldn\u2019t otherwise. Hopefully your friend eventually wakes up and realizes that she should be free to do what she wants and her partner needs to support her.", "I don\u2019t like to think they did it on purpose but she\u2019s an introvert, you handled every social and financial aspect and then you are asked to step down?

And why is being someone\u2019s MOH seen as some sort of mandatory life experience they have to cheat her way into? Plenty of people are never anyone\u2019s MOH, and their lives are not worse because they haven\u2019t had that experience. Why does she *have* to have that role in at least one person\u2019s wedding?

She was used.", "Even if she was pressured, you're her best friend and theoretically the person she wanted to have as her MOH, theoretically someone she should be able to trust and go to through life's challenges. \n\nWhy on earth would she lie to you about the reason?

She says you're a self centered jerk for wanting the money back you paid for their wedding after they switched you out as MOH 2 weeks before the wedding... \nThat's pretty self centered of her I'd say :( I'd try hard to get all/most of the money back and just block her/them.\nShe clearly doesn't value your friendship anymore, only your wallet.\n\nNTA big time", "> Most of the money I don't mind not having paid back because I was paying her back for when she paid my rent in college one month, but I did ask for some of the money back and she called me money hungry.\n\nI mean, you're 28, so presumably you've owed her \"most of\" the $700 you spent for years now. Was this the only way she could get it back?...\n\nBut yeah, I can see how asking for money back immediately after owing her a larger sum for years would seem like you were being money-hungry.\n\nSo really, how much are you actually out? (Add a reasonable amount of interest to that rent loan as well...) \n\nAre you ACTUALLY financially aggrieved here? And look, the swap-at-the-last-minute sucks. It definitely will change the relationship you had with your friend.\n\nBut I'd just move on with my life, TBH. If you want to mend things, apologize and say that your feelings were hurt.

It is wrong to expect her to pay.  I would cancel and get my money back and would be done.

She paid for some clothes and a party bus (pre wedding stuff). OP also helped make some arrangements with vendors for the bride. If OP cancelled those arrangements, she could cause damage to the bride for which OP would be liable. OP has every right to not do further work for the bride, not be the point of contact with vendors, etc, but cancelling the bride\u2019s arrangements is not something she has the right to do and would be a terrible idea.", "There is no way I would take the time to call/ communicate with vendors to give them her number.

Let me say this again: she did so *on behalf of the bride*, not on her own behalf. If OP cancelled the bride\u2019s wedding arrangements because she is no longer MOH, she could be sued by the bride for any damages that caused.
