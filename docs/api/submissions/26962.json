{"id": 26962, "submission_id": "16jzuu6", "title": "AITA for accidentally not bringing enough money into the fair and causing an argument with my boyfriend because of it?", "selftext": "For some background info: I am 25F. My boyfriend is 31M. He is in the process of building a house and has been very stressed over not only the process but the money it is costing him. I am in graduate school. I don't have much money right now but the money I do have is mostly going towards school. We have been dating for a year. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went to the state fair tonight. I expressed to him how excited I was to go and get this specific food that I only get once a year at the fair. I grabbed some cash from my car and threw it into my purse before we went in. I paid for both of our admission tickets and an order of curly fries we shared. He bought us two hot sausages. Then, we went over to the stand that I was most excited for, but he was not getting anything from this stand. The line was very VERY long. We waited for about a half hour.. He expressed a desire for us to just leave and not wait any longer, but I said I really wanted this one so we waited. He also mentioned that he wanted me to take it to go, but I said I really wanted to eat it at the fair while it was still hot. It is the kind of food that isn't good after sitting for a while. \n\nWe finally got to the front of the line and I reached into my purse to pay when I realized I didn't have enough cash left. I thought I had grabbed more than I did from my car. I would never do this on purpose. I said to him... \"I messed up and didn't grab enough money. Is there any way you could give me $5 and I will pay you back when we get back to the car?\" He was immediately disgusted with me and couldn't believe I would not bring enough money into the fair but he gave me the money. Then I realized I actually needed one more dollar so I asked if I could have just one more dollar and reiterated that I would immediately pay him back when we got to the car. He was VERY disgusted with me at the point and snapped at me \"for WHAT?\" because he couldn't understand why I needed another dollar. His tone of voice immediately made me tear up. When the guy working the stand asked if it was for here or to go, I told him to go, and we left. The WHOLE reason we went to the fair was for me to get something from this stand because I love it, and I ended up crying and having to take it to go. \n\nWe walked to the car silently and I immediately reached into the glove box to pay him back and he wouldn't let me open it and said just to drive. That he didn't want me to pay him back. He said (loudly) that I am completely ridiculous and a baby. I told him I was already nervous to ask him for the money in the first place and then his response just made everything worse, and he could not believe I said I was afraid to ask him for money. I said well look at the way you responded... why wouldn't I have been? He claimed that he thought I was \"joking\" when I asked for the extra dollar and that's why he acted the way he did.. But I don't believe it. You could tell in the moment it was genuine irritation. AITA?\n\nEdit: the food I wanted was a Stromboli. It was 9.50, and I had 4 dollars left in my purse.", "created_utc": 1694844393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jzuu6/aita_for_accidentally_not_bringing_enough_money/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend is a controlling and abusive individual, no well-adjusted person would do what he did.

This might help you understand what's going on here.", "NTA.  Frankly, it's embarrassing that at 31 year old man couldn't scrape together $5 for you. He didn't think you were joking, he was being a dick. I sincerely hope he reflects on himself about this but I doubt it. I would very seriously reconsider a relationship with someone who wouldn't even give their girlfriend 1 dollar. I know he ultimately did, but that shit is ridiculous", "NTA. \n\nGirl, this is not a dude you want as a partner. He is an angry fellow with a short fuse and when there are roadbumps in life, this is just a preview of how he will be.\n\nMen who break under stress are men who should be tossed.", "LOL leave him this is clearly an abusive relationship", "NTA\n\nTime to call this relationship over and done with. This dude doesn't respect you and sounds controlling AF.\n\nGet out while you still can.", "NTA\n\nThe moment he called you a baby you should have pulled over and kicked him out of the car, he sounds abusive \n\nHe overreacted after you paid the admission and drove there, he should have been happy to pay for what you were buying and not be mad you didn\u2019t bring enough money \n\nPersonally I would dump his sorry behind before you end up having to pay for his house and not being on the deed", "[deleted]", "Sounds to me that your bf is more stressed about life/money than he's letting on. \n\nHis response was out of proportion and unjustified under the circumstances- if this is out of character you need to talk to him about what's really going on. NTA", "Leave. \nTrust me, my mind was already made up, but calling you a baby cemented it. I spent 8 years with a man like that and it destroyed me, never let anyone dim your shine, next time take a friend who you know will make magical memories the way you deserve.", "NTA\n\nHow he acted is not how a healthy non abusive partner acts. He seems to already have you on edge. If you have to ask if his behavior is okay then he has already started to negatively impact you and your ability to gauge what is reasonable behavior. \n\nLeave him.

I would walk backwards through Hell to make sure my partner had her favorite foods whenever she wanted it. \n\nThis guy needs to go lol", "NTA.  This guy ruined your whole day at the fair over $6.  He made you feel awful and then mocked you for being \"a baby\". He behaved like a sulky baby and blamed you for it.  \n\nI guarantee you that he refused to let you pay him back so that he could hold that $6 over you forever. It will come up every time you have an argument or he wants to make you feel lousy again. And he will. It keeps you off-balance and apologetic, and it sounds to me like he likes it that way.\n\nRun away, OP.  This guy is not a keeper.  He went out of his way to make you miserable, and no matter what his excuse was, that's all you need to know.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is taking his money issues out on you.", "Ummm... why haven't you dumped this guy yet?\n\nHave you so little self respect?\n\n**Its not about the money, he's just fucking abusive!**\n\nIf this is a one off (which i doubt), then he needs to grovel and apologize...\n\nIf he doesn't, YTA to yourself for staying with him...", "NTA. Those are some bright red flags. No amount of stress can justify the way he made you feel. Its 6 dollars, please.", "He's cheap. Have some self respect find someone better.", "NTA he is clearly abusive get out while you can", "ESH really.\n\nHe's overreacting as fuck, very obviously.\n\nYou reiterate how the main reason for going to the fair was this food, yet you somehow spent you money prior to even getting there. Kind of a weird mistake to make. I guess you're more of a AH based on carelessness than malice tho.", "YTA.  You wrote multiple paragraphs to explain that you weren't responsible for having insufficient money because you wanted the food so much.  Then you ramped up the emotion when it turned out to be a problem.  That said, we all make mistakes and if you would just say that you screwed up and didn't have enough money, then your behavior would have been fine.  \n\nYour boyfriend is another kettle of fish though.  We all have favorite things and when people like us, they indulge us.  It doesn't sound as though you make a habit of taking money from your boyfriend and not paying him back so I don't understand why he wouldn't just lend you the dollar until you arrived back at the car.  Or why he was so ungracious about waiting in line.  Or why he called you a baby.\n\nHe sounds awful.  You need to stop and think.  People are usually on their best behavior when dating.  WHY would you want to stay with such a miseryguts?  Imagine adding to the stress by including kids or a house payment.  He has shown you who he is and I think you need to pay attention.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly I would rather be single than to put up with instances like this.

You made a mistake, nothing more. His response though, to berate you in public, OVER SIX DOLLARS?! That shit needs to be addressed. It really sounds like he did not want to be there with you, and he was determined to be aggro and ruin your date. He better explain himself for real, not that \"thought you were joking\" BS, or you should reevaluate the relationship.\n\nNext time, go to the fair with a good friend who won't be a Buzzkillington.", "NTA - This all really boils down to a grown man having a hissy fit over six bucks.  \n\nYou should never, for any reason under the sun, feel nervous about borrowing a few dollars from your boyfriend. It's not like you were asking for a 20K loan or an elephant ear covered in gold leaf and served on a silver platter. \n\nThe fact that he tried to play it off as a joke is a load of shit, or he would have said so in the moment.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry he was so mean to you\n\nAlso I don\u2019t understand why men in their late 20s to early 30s date women 5 years + younger than them and then get angry, surprised, annoyed that they\u2019re less mature.

Sorry- no clue why I acted like it was a secret \ud83e\udd23", "Is it? Could be... I've read a few posts today, of abused OPs that make me angry for them/at them... so could be that I'm not being very sensitive here...\ud83d\ude11\n\nBut seems painfully obvious that this relationship is abusive to OP...", "I mean, to say OP has no self respect and pretty much making them feel ridiculous for still being together with this guy is not really the way to go about it. I dont know if this relationship is abusive or not, but it can be very difficult to step away from it or any relationship in general. The obvious \"just break up\" is usually not that simple. Calling OP an AH to themself is also not a really kind and helpful way of wording it. On top of OPs boyfriend making them feel like an idiot, you're kind of doubling down.\n\nI know your comment comes from a good place, in stark contrast to OPs boyfriend, but I'd word it differently."]}
