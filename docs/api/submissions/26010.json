I can't blame you though - she gave you every reason to be spiteful by purposely sabotaging an event you wanted to. She was either lying about the reason she wanted to leave or just unbelievably hypocritical. \n\nBottom line is, you don't want to go to the concert she wants to. Whatever the reason, it's the truth. You're at least giving her advanced notice and it's clear she can go with someone else, you're not stopping her or making her cut out way too early. She's the AH for pushing this.", "Well, if she wants to go to the concert, make sure she spends *her* money on the tickets, so if/when if you have to leave five minutes into the opening act, *you* won\u2019t be out of pocket. \n\nAnd\u2026 *standing* tickets? Like standing room only, not even an assigned seat to retreat to? Is that what she bought? That would give *my* claustrophobia a twinge for sure!\n\nBut, yea, this does sound suspicious AF. I would keep an eye on this supposed \u201cdiscomfort\u201d. Maybe she was just \u201cuncomfortable\u201d being around smart people.

Was there someone at the table she had history with? Did someone say something rude about her that she is embarrassed to share?", "NAH.\n\nI actually get where your girlfriend is coming from; being in a room of strangers is different from being at a concert because of the atmosphere. You're kind of anonymous at a concert, while it's not quite the same when you're sharing a table with strangers. \n\nThat said, it was unfair of her to ask you to leave because she was uncomfortable, especially as she knew you were very excited about the event. There's no reason why she couldn't have left on her own. It was also very unfair for her to get upset and blame you for being understandably disappointed. \n\nWhile you were a bit out of line for accusing her of lying about being uncomfortable so she could leave your event, you absolutely have every right to not want to attend her concert. You're right, you can't have one partner getting to do what they enjoy, but not the other. \n\nOnce things have calmed down, maybe have a discussion about these kinds of things going forward. Ask your girlfriend if she really doesn't want to attend events with you then just be honest about it, rather than setting you up for disappointment.", "YTA, it's pretty clear that you are just being spiteful and only doing it because of the quiz because when she brought that up, you immediately continued to be spiteful because of the quiz. you really can't understand that being at a concert for an act you're really passionate about, surrounded by other fans who love the same thing you do, in a venue that regularly accommodates tons of people, is different from being crammed at a bar table with strangers for trivia?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
