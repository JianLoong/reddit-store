I had a situation 2 years ago where I was parked on the street at my apartment just after graduating so I was unemployed (actively looking for a job, found one a few weeks later!) and I caught COVID (no idea from where as literally the *only* place I'd been that week was an outdoor farmer's market and I stayed long enough to buy a few veggies, it was like 10 min) and the next morning I woke up to move my car but I was so shaky and feverish and sick I couldn't make it out the door to move it. So I got a ticket. First parking ticket ever in my life. And paying that ticket meant I couldn't afford to buy more cough and cold medicine bc I was on the job hunt so I got to suffer. Do you think I deserved all of the consequences that followed that ticket? How do you think I should have solved the situation for a better outcome? It's nice that 40 bucks doesn't mean shit to you, but not everyone is you. I didn't have a garage space, I was new to the area so I didn't have anyone to ask, and my bf was out of town on a work trip. So it's not like I was careless, everything just was inconvenient at the same time. This is life. There is not a lot of parking in my city and there was even less back then because the restaurants were all doing that thing where they expanded into the street with tables for the 6ft requirement so people visiting were all parking in the neighborhoods, so it's not like there was a non-street sweeping spot I could have parked in. Again, I'm not saying OP's bf is right bc I don't think he is, but I am saying you could improve your empathy *a lot* because some situations are not so clear cut.", "It\u2019s probably more that I understand that I\u2019m responsible for making sure I\u2019m parked properly and to check the signs near my vehicle, actually.", "Yep.... the BF had to drive on the street...past all those signs.  So there was no need for her to warn him about the traffic rules.", "Yes, you're right. You are responsible. It's just a nice thing to do with visitors to your home to warn them about the peculiarities of parking on your block.", "Yes, she doesn\u2019t HAVE to, but it\u2019s a courtesy. Someone is coming and staying at your place, it\u2019s a courtesy to give a heads up."]}
