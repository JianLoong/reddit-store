There is not a lot of parking in my city and there was even less back then because the restaurants were all doing that thing where they expanded into the street with tables for the 6ft requirement so people visiting were all parking in the neighborhoods, so it's not like there was a non-street sweeping spot I could have parked in.

Anyways, the driver didn't have the money for the parking ticket and wanted to pay it in person right then because it was cheaper so she made each of us in the car give her a couple of dollars.

The fact he is even bothering to argue about this and blames you is pathetic. Do you want to listen to him whine and moan about every little inconvenience he doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for?", "They do it in my north Austin neighborhood about every other month but they don\u2019t really tell us. It just shows up and they drive around the cars like you said.", "No, OP expects those who drive and park in their neighbourhood to read the street signs. She doesn't need to know the information at all, as she doesn't park on the street. Holding OP accountable for his inability to read the signs is bull.", "No one really deserves that kind of humiliation.", "In case you're interested, CoA has a [service map](https://www.austintexas.gov/streetsweeping) with areas and dates linked on their site. \ud83d\udc4d", "I'm not saying she's fully accountable. I'm saying they're a slight asshole. They don't have to be one in the same much like someone can see someone about to step on some nails. They aren't accountable for their well-being but if you know about it and know they park in the same area often why wouldn't you bring it up?", "It's not that hard to read a sign. Things like this get posted all over the place. If this was downtown and not residential how does your logic apply? You want business owners to stand outside and say \"no parking here to the street!\" like grown adults can't read?", "To your first question: easily. I've known a number of folk who live in city centers and don't drive at all. They could care less about the parking regulations, and I would never expect them to advise me on it when I drive to see them. It's not a basic courtesy for a great many folk. Not at all.", "How about because they park in the same area often, and I expect them to have already read the signs... \n\n\\*sheesh\\* I'll say good night here. You and OP's boyfriend expect more than is reasonable.", "Depends on the area. Some post every few feet, other areas are lucky to have one sign within several block 'for the area' and usually get away with it by hoping nobody challenges them on tickers or will put blanket statements into bylaws.", "Sometimes there aren't even nearby signs and OP won't answer the INFO question someone else posed about it. There have definetly been areas neglected where 'you're just supposed to know'and bank on people not challenging them. Or adding it broadly in some bylaw as a catch all.", "Ironically I actually know the street signs better when I walk since they're in my peripheral for a longer time, though if I walked or drove the same paths frequently it would even out. If people don't think it's a basic courtesy then I think they need to up their game. We just have different thresholds it seems.", "Signs are placed on every block in every major city I've been in... I'm capable of walking to the nearest sign to double check, and based on the narrative I'm sure OP's boyfriend is, too. I'd bet you are as well. It's your responsibility to check as the driver. \n\nOthers have commented about New York and Austin. I'll add Toronto, Vancouver, Portland, Seattle, and San Francisco. They have so much parking signage that you'd have be wilfully ignorant to miss it. Vancouver is the worst by far, and there are signs on every  block.", "Oh, I agree it's a courtesy. I disagree that it's a basic one by any means, or that OP should be taking responsibility for her boyfriend's behaviour and the resulting ticket. \n\nThe funny thing for me: I do give folk advice of where to park in my neighbourhood, and always have. For years in Vancouver, I'd move my car into a street so guests could use my off-street parking and avoid the hassles faced by non-locals. But - and this is a big but - it was never expected, and the folk who received advice or my parking space expressed gratitude, not entitlement. \n\nI don't have an issue with your position as much as I do with the entitlement that your position in this discussion represents. OP is not wrong to not have offered the courtesy, nor is she responsible for the parking ticket."]}
