I had a situation 2 years ago where I was parked on the street at my apartment just after graduating so I was unemployed (actively looking for a job, found one a few weeks later!) and I caught COVID (no idea from where as literally the *only* place I'd been that week was an outdoor farmer's market and I stayed long enough to buy a few veggies, it was like 10 min) and the next morning I woke up to move my car but I was so shaky and feverish and sick I couldn't make it out the door to move it. So I got a ticket. First parking ticket ever in my life. And paying that ticket meant I couldn't afford to buy more cough and cold medicine bc I was on the job hunt so I got to suffer. Do you think I deserved all of the consequences that followed that ticket? How do you think I should have solved the situation for a better outcome? It's nice that 40 bucks doesn't mean shit to you, but not everyone is you. I didn't have a garage space, I was new to the area so I didn't have anyone to ask, and my bf was out of town on a work trip. So it's not like I was careless, everything just was inconvenient at the same time. This is life. There is not a lot of parking in my city and there was even less back then because the restaurants were all doing that thing where they expanded into the street with tables for the 6ft requirement so people visiting were all parking in the neighborhoods, so it's not like there was a non-street sweeping spot I could have parked in. Again, I'm not saying OP's bf is right bc I don't think he is, but I am saying you could improve your empathy *a lot* because some situations are not so clear cut.", "It\u2019s probably more that I understand that I\u2019m responsible for making sure I\u2019m parked properly and to check the signs near my vehicle, actually.", "Yep.... the BF had to drive on the street...past all those signs.  So there was no need for her to warn him about the traffic rules.", "Yes, you're right. You are responsible. It's just a nice thing to do with visitors to your home to warn them about the peculiarities of parking on your block.", "Yes, she doesn\u2019t HAVE to, but it\u2019s a courtesy. Someone is coming and staying at your place, it\u2019s a courtesy to give a heads up.", "NTA\n\nI work in Denver.  The metermaids are no joke.  You have to read all the signs around a street to make sure you know when to park(some lanes become parking lanes after a certain hr, otherwise you can drive in them), how long to park, where to park and which direction to park.  That is at normal time. When street sweeping starts, you should already know because you have read ALL the other signs. \n\nIf he can't or won't read the signs, that is his fault.\n\nIt doesn't matter that his city doesn't have street sweeping.   I am sure that they have signs about parking requirements.", "NTA\n\n\nThis reminded me of when I moved states to be closer to my sister, I took her to the city while she had to do something, I didn\u2019t read the sign that said it was paid parking, copped a $30 fine. She felt so bad, but as I said to her, it\u2019s on me as the driver to read it. \nTbh i was so used to small towns (less than 2,000 people) I didn\u2019t even think about the differences.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault but as someone who lives in an area that is heavily ticketed with strict parking rules, I do try to look out for visitors who park around our home. Eg make sure they have a guest pass, are parked on the right side of the street when it\u2019s street sweeping etc. It\u2019s a courteous and helpful thing to make sure they are adhering to the parking rules.

My friend's car got towed from my house because I didn't read the parking rules properly. 100% my fault. I insisted on paying.

No. I feel like we are partners who look out for each other.", "Austin here, no idea street sweeping was a thing but I\u2019m kind of anal about checking for signs.

We were in three cars and the car I was in parked over the line (the driver did this because - for some weird reason - they wanted all the cars parked next to each other in the parking garage). Anyways, the driver didn't have the money for the parking ticket and wanted to pay it in person right then because it was cheaper so she made each of us in the car give her a couple of dollars. Well, I only had $5 for lunch so I ended up buying something like a hamburger and water. I was starving by the time I got home and my parents were PISSED that the driver forced us to pay for her mistake.", "Seriously.

Either way NTA.", "Yeah, I was only addressing \"Austin\" specifically as OP referenced it in their post.", "Preferably on Judge Judy for all of us to enjoy.", "Issues like this is why there is a growing movement to make parking tickets and infraction fees income-based. The argument is that the current method only really punishes the poor and those who live paycheck to paycheck. The wealthy aren\u2019t actually punished by a fee that they can pay without any impact on their lifestyle. In too many cases that has led wealthy individuals to knowingly break laws since they can easily afford to pay the related fines for doing so. \nI\u2019m really sorry that you had to go without necessary medication when you were sick."]}
