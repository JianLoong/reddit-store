This cottage is in another country (it's in Canada, we are from the US), so on top of it being a 4.5 hour flight away, it requires a 3 hour drive and then a 30+ minute ferry ride, as the cottage is located on an island that is ONLY accessible by boat. Last time we stayed at the cottage, there was no hot shower water for the entire 5 days. Before that, I was exposed to bats in the sleeping room and had to drive to New York to get vaccinated for rabies. Before that trip, we lost power and had no hot water and I had food poisoning (the water is unfiltered from the lake). It's always something going wrong and I'm just so, so, sick of it. I told him I'd stay for 2-3 nights next year, but I don't want to stay 5 nights again. It's also very difficult with a toddler who never sleeps through the night. This cottage means a lot to my husband (he has fond memories of being there with his family and friends when growing up), but it has always been a source of intense anxiety and discomfort for me. From the bugs, to the bats, to the lack of basic amenities (we often lose power or hot water), I just always get stressed and dread being there. Every single year I dread it. My husband knows this and has been working on \"fixing up\" the cottage, but it's just very uncomfortable for me and he knows this. I have put up with it for years but I'm tired and want to limit how long I will stay there in the future. \n\n Now he is threatening to take our 2.5 year old son there for a week+ without me, which I find unacceptable. I have never threatened to take our son anywhere without his consent, much less to another country. Our son is afraid of flies (screams and cries whenever they get near) and doesn't sleep through the night. I don't think he will enjoy this trip that he's too young to consent to, especially with his mom gone. \n\nAITA for telling my husband that I won't allow him to take my son to a different country without my consent?", "created_utc": 1693503701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166hnhq/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_take_our_toddler/", "score": 4809, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bats that bite you in the night requiring that you drive to New York for rabies shots (yikes!) Untreated water that causes food poisoning. \n\nThis is not a safe place for a 2.5 year old. Period.\n\nIf your husband wants to make this the family getaway every year then HE needs to get off his butt and put some energy into fixing the place up FIRST. So he needs to fix the water situation, and if the water that comes into the house can't be made safe, then he needs to ensure there is enough bottled water for everyone to use. He needs to get the cabin completely sealed up so that no bats can get in. If he says \"that's impossible\" then he can go there on his own and be a wild grizzly mountain man, but it's not a safe place for wife and toddler. Sorry, dude. Wtf? I would make a list of what needs fixing at the cottage, and ask him to make the repairs or pay someone to make the repairs and once the cabin is safe for human habitation, then you and your son will go spend time there, not before.", "NTA\n\nIt's a remote island cabin. If something goes wrong, help is *not* getting there in time. And OP elsewhere in the comments posts that her husband has ignored issues with their son multiple times and those issues turned out to be legit after a visit to the doc's office, therefore, she doesn't fully trust his judgment in situations where something might be going wrong with a kid.\n\nI mean, in a general sense it is assholish to *forbid* a spouse from doing something. But in this case it's justified, and perhaps is even her duty as a parent.\n\nBesides, kids don't really start to form memories that last until sometime after 3...", "NTA  \nIf there is a legitimate health concern (unfiltered water, no heat without sufficent other heat sources, rabies, etc.) Then it would be very irresponsible to take a child younger than 5 there for an extended period, especially without both parents.\n\nAdditionally, threatening to take a child somewhere against the wishes of the other parent is a dickish thing to do without extreme extenuating circumstances. \"I wanted to\" is not extreme extenuating circumstances.\n\nThat being said, if he really wants to go, and you would be willing to for a short period, I would advise treating it more like a camping trip (bringing extra heaters, sleeping bags, backup power/propane stove/etc) and possibly staying in a hotel with the kiddo for a day or two/flying out later so he can get there and clean out any pest creatures first. This is clearly important to him, so it's a good idea to be flexible, but make it clear that if he tries to take your child out of the country you're GOING to have an issue with that", "NTA. The multiple incidences of guests at this cottage needing rabies shots due to contact with bats, the unfiltered water, and the remote location make this appropriate for adults and older kids only. A toddler can't tell an adult if a bat landed on him or accurately describe symptoms of illness. These are legitimate safety concerns. One day your son and husband can spend father son time in the batty buggy luxury-free North, but not yet.", "If there are bats living in the cabin, then bat guano is my #1 concern. It\u2019s dangerous for respiratory problems. \n\nBeyond rabies, bats also carry other nasty infectious issues. \n\nThis is a hard NO. \n\nLet him go alone. Spend the week working to fix the place up. Once it\u2019s actually inhabitable then you can consider it.", "NTA. Wtf is up with your husband **threatening to abscond with your child** to a remote and potentially dangerous cabin outside of the country? That\u2019s like instant-divorce words. It\u2019s literally illegal for your husband to take your son out of the country without your consent. Maybe let him know that. \n\n*** anyone that wants to argue the cabin isn\u2019t potentially dangerous, spare me. If anything goes wrong there\u2019s no way they\u2019re getting any level of medical attention in less than an hour, and the cabin has bats and unclean water. Not a suitable or safe place for a toddler.", "Omg NTA even a little. I can't believe some of these comments!! Bats don't have to be symptomatic to expose humans to rabies. If one even gets in your house, doctors recommend rabies shots, let alone if one actually bites you. And I'm sorry, but lack of POTABLE WATER would be a full stop no for me - if mom got food poisoning from the water, little guy is that much more susceptible. Plus when she expresses discomfort with the idea, dad threatens to take him anyway?! Insane. Major parenting decisions like this are two yeses one no.", "NTA.\n\nNot only would your son likely not enjoy it, he certainly won't remember it.\n\nYou are aware that a minor child is not supposed to leave the US with just 1 parent without written, notarized consent of the other parent?", "I would let him take the toddler because after a few days and nights of screaming he wont rush to do.it agsin...", "NTA. I think you are right to be concerned, as it sounds like a lot can go wrong, and traveling with a toddler can be trying at the best of times. It's sounds so isolated in case of an emergency.\n\nAnd frankly, if you hate the cabin so much, just stop going! Don't \"put up with it\" for 2-3 days. Just don't go.\n\nMy dad would take us camping w/o mother at times (she didn't like camping). But we were older...5th/6th grade.\n\nUnless one goes camping a lot, and knows how to deal with things, I wouldn't take a toddler that young on such a trip.", "What the fuck, unfiltered lake water? That\u2019s just stupid and lazy. Take some freakin purification tablets. Boil it. Buy a water filter. Something.\n\nNTA. The cabin and remoteness aren\u2019t the problem. Sharing the cabin and the drinking water with wildlife is the problem.", "If your kid has never been so much as camping overnight, then a week effectively camping in a cottage in the middle of nowhere is unlikely to be a great introduction.\n\nBut for people in a relationship, you two don't seem to be doing very much talking to each other, so I'll call you ESH.", "YTA \n\nYour son will probably enjoy being at the cottage without his mother freaking out over every little thing.   \n\nBuy them a brita filter for the drinking and cooking water, and ease up a bit.   You seem to be wound super tight.", "YTA \n\nI get that most of Reddit will side with you but it isn\u2019t unsafe, at all, your just very demanding with your creature comforts. What really bothers me is you forcing your neuroses on your kid. Suck it up and spend a week at your husbands childhood cabin. By all means help make improvements so you feel better and more comfortable but bailing on it because you have to go a week without TikTok is bad, forcing your kid to go without is worse.\n\nGod so much of this is terrible, you acting so entitled with a luxury unavailable to 99% of people on earth, forcing those unjustifiable fears (flies? Seriously) on your children. \n\nNobody would side with you if they had the full context of the situation", "YTA. You aren\u2019t making any effort to compromise with him because YOU don\u2019t like the cabin. Most of the things you mention are no big deal to handle - no hot water? So what? You can heat water on whatever cooking method is used or over a campfire. No power is the same thing - so what, plenty of campers deal with that on the regular. If it\u2019s close enough to the US border to drive to NY then it also isn\u2019t in the back of beyond, so emergency evacuation is quite possible via helicopter or similar. \n\nThe only thing that is at all a concern is the bats, but you aren\u2019t talking to him about how to address that issue, as I\u2019m sure it can be dealt with.", "YTA. You sound much too precious about yourself and now you're projecting onto your husband and son. If your husband wants to take your son and will take all due care to keep him fed, healthy and happy there really shouldn't be an issue. BTW, what does \"exposed to bats\" mean to the point of you needing a rabies shot?", "Lol yes your the a YTA \u2026 don\u2019t go if you\u2019re miserable but why stop them ? Do you think he\u2019s gonna stay there forever?", "YTA, commenters saying NTA are babies. He is trying to create similar childhood memories as he had and you are ruining that opportunity by being scared of roughing it a little.", "Honestly I think this is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. It seems like your hatred for the cabin is clouding your perception and leaving your husband few options to enjoy his hobby with his son, and your husband is pushing back too hard. I do think the situation you describe is a veto-power one (both parents should be on board) but I just don\u2019t get any sense that you are or trying to want to make this work. \n\nAnd now you\u2019re playing tug of war with your son. I think you two need more than an AITA judgement.", "NTA\n\nYou not liking the place aside, why would your husband want to take a tiny tot that doesn't sleep through the night there? Sounds miserable. I know he is excited to share this cabin and memories with his kid but he is just to young right now. \n\nI had a very similar story to this actually. A friend of our family has a similar cabin on a lake in Canada. On an island, can only get there by boat, hot water is a maybe along with electricity. My father, younger sister and I went with them one summer. I was in 2nd maybe 3rd grade. I don't know because *I remember very little about the trip*. Even with the help of photographs I just do not have many concrete memories of the place and what I do have might be made up. \n\nI know I had a good time, milk in a bag was so odd to my American ways. I remember the leeches on my legs from the lake and how bitter cold the water was even in summer. \n\nBut I don't remember much more than smells (pine trees) or sensations (freezing cold water seeping through my tiny wetsuit). And I wasn't 2.5 years old. \n\nIt would just be a waste of time and energy and your husband would probably not enjoy himself as much as he thinks.", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nI would be extremely hestitant about  bringing a LO so young, to such a difficult place to get to and stay at.\n\nThe cabin must be a very important place for your husband. Is there any way to explain to him that your LO is too young to actually *participate* in the various cabin activities? If he can wait until your kiddo is 6 or 7, he'd be richly rewarded.\n\nPlus, is your husband aware of the shenanigans a toddler can get into? I'm talking about unsafe, dangerous, risky stuff...", "YTA!", "YTA for the way you've framed this.\n\nHe's going to Canada, not North Korea. He's not \"threatening,\" he's saying what he wants to do. You're acting like he intends to kidnap your kid for Pete's sake. \n\nYou've expressed your hatred for the place and you refuse to go. So don't. Your son doesn't sleep through the night = not your problem. No showers = everyone will be stinky for awhile. WTF cares? The only real health issue you identified is the bats. Has that been dealt with? If so--you should let them go and have a relaxing time by yourself while they're out roughing it.", "YTA. You don\u2019t like going there. Your husband found a solution. You stay home. Unless you\u2019re legitimately concerned that your husband is going to forget to feed or change the kid, let him take his son to his cabin. They are probably going to be spending time there throughout the kid\u2019s childhood. Look at it as a week to yourself. Read a book, binge Netflix, relax.", "YTA. Roughing it has been happening since the beginning of the human race. No different than camping.", "What is going to happen? Really what\u2019s going to happen?

If anything, he will learn how good he has it back in the city.\n\nAlso, wow all these commentators are just weak. 5 days without electricity or being a little cold doesn\u2019t kill anyone. I would switch dangerous with uncomfortable.", "YTA.  What a bunch of helicopter mom doomsday bullshit. Probably far more likely to have a incident requiring medical care at home, hit by a bus, etc.", "YTA- as a Canadian camper your son will be fine especially this time of year. Also Canada has a treaty with the US, you don\u2019t have to worry about him taking your kid and not bringing him back. We are not some foreign country. \n\nBut let\u2019s discuss the cottage shall we, so based on what you\u2019re saying I have a feeling it\u2019s near or around Manitoulin Island, you are exaggerating about how remote it is. I\u2019m thinking Georgian Bay Area? This time of year the bugs are done, so that is a stupid argument. Also shall we discuss the other multimillion dollar cottages in the area.\n\nListen you don\u2019t like camping, here are things that will make it more enjoyable.\n1. Always bring your own water, you had what we like to call beaver fever. You can fill it at the local Home Hardware on you way to the cottage. Use this water for cooking and to consume. Always!!!! \n2. Your husband needs to invest in a good Honda generator. They are quiet easy to run, and run for hours.\n3. Buy citronella oil bug spray for you and kiddo, and buy a bug zapper that looks like a tennis racket, you can find them at one of the many outfitters along the way. Also bring children\u2019s allergy meds, not Benadryl something like reactine or Claritin. If you child has a bad reaction to bug bites, this will clear it up.\n4. And one suggestion is your hubby goes and opens the cottage ahead of time, maybe send him a week beforehand to air it out, clean it. So when you come it\u2019s more comfortable for you. \n\nListen just because you hate it, doesn\u2019t give you the right to take that experience away from your child. Going to the cottage is the few times in life when kids can really disconnect from the internet and be kids.  Your son is very lucky to be able to have that experience.", "NAH - no assholes here IMO. You hate the cabin and have concerns about how your kid is going to take it, husband wants to expose your kid to new experiences. Let this be a FAFO experience for your husband - f*ck around and find out. You\u2019ve expressed your concerns you think your child is going to have a difficult time, and your husband wants to insist on them going. Let them. How much do you want to bet that on hour 3 of a screaming toddler who doesn\u2019t want to sleep is going to change his mind fast and they\u2019ll be home earlier than planned? \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wrong and kiddo learns to love it and enjoy the new experience? Great! Daddy/toddler bonding experience, mom gets a mini vacation. Win/win all around.", "NTA - the water issues are bad enough, but now your mother-in-law is getting rabies vaccines as well because of bad exposure there? I'm terrified he would take your son, and with his cavalier attitude, refuse to even acknowledge If the child was bitten and would fail to get him care. Then you are left having to take this kid for rabies shots every time he goes to that cabin. I promise, you do that more than once, and the kid will throw such a screaming fit that your husband won't even be able to get him in the car!", "I just want to ask. What would the difference be if he was in Canada vs the other side of the US?", "This cabin legit sounds like the house I grew up in, in Canada. Travel insurance exists for medical emergencies, you can haul potable water to the cabin on the ferry. They also sell water purification tablets to make drinking water available. There is literally a solution to each problem you listed. You can have your child vaccinated for rabies before the trip. And also, a parent wanting to take their child somewhere isn\u2019t a threat. Quit being so damn dramatic.", "YTA. Okay, can we stop saying foreign country as though you would expect the Mounties to team up with Samoli pirates? You have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed about vaccinations and clean drinking water so make sure you kid is vaccinated and your husband uses a water filtration system for all drinking and cooking uses.", "YTA. Dad wants to share something he loves with his child. There are bats all over the USA. Canada has vaccines. Canada also has air ambulances.", "NTA. Since you and your husband are still married and both custodial parents, I'm not sure if it's legally wrong to take your son out of the country but it's morally wrong to do it without your consent. Where is your son's passport - can you secure it?\n\nYour concerns are not unfounded. The cabin is not safe for a toddler. It's alarming that your husband doesn't see that and that his love for this cabin is outweighing his love and responsibility as a parent. \n\nI would die on this hill and make counseling a requirement for the health of your marriage.", "YTA for using the word \u201cletting\u201d in this context. Your shared child is not only yours to consent or not to travel. It comes off as condescending and controlling. \n\nEither you have chosen to have a child with a responsible adult or you haven\u2019t. Parents absolutely parent differently, and that\u2019s a good thing. Dad being a bit more lax while camping is not damaging. Hot showers while camping are not required. Many people camp off grid all the time. A little bit of dirt is good for both the immune system and resilience. Dealing with mosquitos is part of life and I\u2019m sure some bug spray is available. And ensuring that only bottled or imported water is used is a reasonable compromise. Food poisoning can happen, and while not at all fun, is usually a relatively minor issue. \n\nBut if you\u2019ve gotten yourself into a situation where you can\u2019t trust your husband to parent appropriately, that\u2019s your biggest problem. \n\nMost of your complaints are not serious \n\nBats in or around the cottage are two different things.

I think you\u2019re just a drama queen. \n\nAnd about the water. You can\u2019t drink it if you\u2019re not used to it. Your husband probably can because he grew up with it. To bad you got sick. But why not just bring bottled water for you and for cooking?\n\nI just think your a spoiled city girl who can\u2019t stand to be out in the nature without all that you are used to from home. \n\nBut why take the experience away from your child just because you don\u2019t like it?", "Yta", "YTA for the language you use.

If that is the case, why did you have a child with him?", "NTA. Outside of all safety concerns, there is absolutely nothing for your kid there.

This cottage is in another country (it's in Canada, we are from the US), so on top of it being a 4.5 hour flight away, it requires a 3 hour drive and then a 30+ minute ferry ride, as the cottage is located on an island that is ONLY accessible by boat. Last time we stayed at the cottage, there was no hot shower water for the entire 5 days. Before that, I was exposed to bats in the sleeping room and had to drive to New York to get vaccinated for rabies. Before that trip, we lost power and had no hot water and I had food poisoning (the water is unfiltered from the lake). It's always something going wrong and I'm just so, so, sick of it. I told him I'd stay for 2-3 nights next year, but I don't want to stay 5 nights again. It's also very difficult with a toddler who never sleeps through the night. This cottage means a lot to my husband (he has fond memories of being there with his family and friends when growing up), but it has always been a source of intense anxiety and discomfort for me. From the bugs, to the bats, to the lack of basic amenities (we often lose power or hot water), I just always get stressed and dread being there. Every single year I dread it. My husband knows this and has been working on \"fixing up\" the cottage, but it's just very uncomfortable for me and he knows this. I have put up with it for years but I'm tired and want to limit how long I will stay there in the future. \n\n Now he is threatening to take our 2.5 year old son there for a week+ without me, which I find unacceptable. I have never threatened to take our son anywhere without his consent, much less to another country. Our son is afraid of flies (screams and cries whenever they get near) and doesn't sleep through the night. I don't think he will enjoy this trip that he's too young to consent to, especially with his mom gone. \n\nAITA for telling my husband that I won't allow him to take my son to a different country without my consent?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "If you are concerned about rabies, have your 2 year old vaccinated.

If you are concerned about flies, bring a fly swatter or fly paper.  Honestly, doesn't sound worse than camping.  I think you should take a family trip and both of you work on fixing up the cabin and showing your kid that roughing it can be fun!", "No. And the biggest problem being, if the baby has a medical problem, there is no where to go and no way to get to anywhere else on a reasonable amount of time.", "Yta.

The bats thing is really worrying as rabies is still fatal if not treated and a small child may not have the words to tell you they've been bitten. Bats aside, the lack of clean water, heat, and electricity make this a rustic experience that only a seasoned camper or someone looking to truly \"rough it\" would enjoy.

Could he even manage a fussy toddler for a week, with all that travel, by himself?", "Soft YTA. You don't want to go, you don't have to go.

But drinking unfiltered lake water is NOT something any reasonable person does by choice when camping and the potential to suddenly lose power also needs to be compensated for. If he was planning a trip to a national park and he said \"we'll drink out of streams and not bother cooking our food/bringging soap, and who needs sleeping bags when we have a tent and faulty electric heater\" I think we'd all agree that the increased risk of illness/hygene issues this causes aren't \"universal\" safety issues, they're the result of poor planning.\n\n3. absolutely is an issue with outdoor activities, although steps can and should be taken to mitigate them. Especially for a child. If there are vermin in the area you plan to camp (whether a cabin or a campsite) and you know that, you need to be prepared for it, especially if there's a child involved. Children also need greater supervision when around potentially hazardous wildlife, which one adult may not be sufficent for.\n\n4. is tricky in the USA. Yes, you can sometimes take a child to another country if you are not the sole guardian, and that isn't technically illegal everywhere. But some places will require you to provide proof that the other parent gave permission and you cannot travel with a child without it. Some jurisdictions consider what he's suggesting doing literal kidnapping (since it's explicitly against her will). That's a problem and would be a problem no matter where he was going leaving the country, but would not be one with a domestic national park. There's a reason that getting a passport requires consent from both parents for under 18s, and it's because you SHOULD NOT be taking a child to another country without joint parental consent. \n\nSo overall...yes, some of this may be risks that would occur to some degree in outdoor activities. But he's very clearly not mitigating the risk enough for the adults involved (otherwise, OP would not have gotten sick), much less for a child. Maybe he's bluffing or maybe he genuinely thinks it would be fine, but it's still unnecessary and borderline negligent risk taking. If he provided OP with a very comprehensive and well thought out plan to mitigate any and all such risks, then maybe it would be less so, but it sounds like these are all ongoing problems.\n\nAnd none of that affects the fact that OP told him no. As a parent, you get 'veto' powers over the actions of another parent sometimes. Things like taking the child to another country, getting them an unnecessary major medical proceedure, marrying them off, putting them up for adoption, etc. are all things where if one partner does not agree the other shouldn't just go ahead with them (and it may be illegal to do so). She doesn't believe this is safe, she told him no, and his response was \"well, maybe I'll just kidnap our kid then\" which is shitty behavior on his part.", "Our last names did match on the passports so maybe that\u2019s why.

When there is no direct contact with a bat, the risk of rabies is extremely rare and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is not recommended. In an adult, a bat landing on clothing would be considered reason for intervention only if a bite, scratch or saliva exposure into a wound or mucous membrane cannot be ruled out. In a child, a bat landing on clothing could be considered a reason for intervention, as a history to rule out a bite, scratch or mucous membrane exposure may not be reliable. When a bat is found in the room with a child or an adult who is unable to give a reliable history, assessment of direct contact may be difficult. Factors indicating that direct contact may have occurred include the individual waking up crying or upset while the bat was in the room or observation of an obvious bite or scratch mark.\" \n(https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-18-rabies-vaccine.html#p4c17a5b2) \n\nUS CDC policy:\n\"Bat bites can be very small so a person might not always know when they have been bitten by a bat. PEP should also be considered when direct contact between a person and a bat might have occurred, and a bite or scratch cannot be confidently ruled out. For example, if you wake up with a bat in your room, you may have been exposed to rabies and should see your doctor or call your health department, even if you don\u2019t feel a bite. Healthcare providers will conduct a risk assessment to determine if you need rabies vaccination. If there is no clear explanation for how the bat got into your home, you may also need to consult a bat remediation specialist to determine if bats are living in your home.\" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/bats.html#:~:text=Rabies%20can%20spread%20to%20people,and%20tests%20negative%20for%20rabies.)", "Nope.

Backcountry in a tent? (The horror!). A boat access cabin with even intermittent electricity and hot water (and I'm guessing a wood stove) is much cushier than that. Just because you find life intolerable without city amenities doesn't mean it's unsafe, and your SO has acknowledged that you have no interest in being anywhere less developed than your home.\n\nLearning to live in a more rustic environment and enjoy the outdoors (or unimproved cabins) is a useful life skill and many of us have great experiences of doing this with our parents from as young as we can remember. Your SO is offering to solo parent while giving your kid this privilege you were clearly denied.\n\nBy car then boat it would be completely straightforward to bring everything needed to do this with no unusual safety risk (as safe as walking your child to school along sidewalks, at least). To address your safety concerns one by one:\n\n-Lake water can be boiled, run through a backpacking filter, or purified with iodine or chlorine tabs. Zero problem.\n\n-Bats don't bite unless provoked. Lots of us have coexisted outdoors with bats our whole lives, including the occasional indoor intruder. Portable kid beds with bug nets would protect from both bats and flies. I'm sorry something very rare happened to you, although I'll note rabies exposure is both vanishingly unlikely and treatable. They can bring a tent as backup if a severe infestation has rendered the cabin uninhabitable (guano, noise, etc).\n\n-Remoteness is not inherently dangerous. Anywhere within 3h of an international airport in Canada is within less response time than that to search and rescue, and a sick or injured kid will get a helicopter dispatched no problem. Get an InReach satellite transponder if it's not on cell networks, they work anywhere in the world. Make sure you have travel insurance that will cover Medevac (usually standard for 14 days with travel credit cards).\n\n-Power outages don't hurt you, particularly if you happen to have backcountry gear on hand.\n\nThe reason I'll say ESH instead of YTA is that it sounds like your SO has previously done this trip without adequate prep, which is irresponsible.

While I understand the nostalgia of a certain place, your husband fails to realize how dangerous it could be for your child. \n\nHim \"fixing it up\" should be extensive before you take your child there. \n\nRegarding your own discomfort, I'll say whatever. You're an adult so deal with it or don't go if you don't like it.  But for a young child who's much more susceptible to everything, I'd say this is wrong.", "NTA. Bats, bugs, bad water and food poisoning?  Yikes!  Doesn\u2019t sound fit for human habitation.  I\u2019ve done better in a tent.  Hubs needs to get serious about fixing up the place to be fit for humans.  I wonder if it even meets local building and safety codes for occupancy.", "NTA. Something seems off. \n\nIf his intentions are good work on a plan and timeline to make the cottage bare minimum livable. And help him work towards that goal so you can all enjoy a cabin vacay in the summers. \n\nIf that bothers him I\u2019d call it a red flag", "NTA.  The wilderness is inherently dangerous, and it's up to adults to keep toddlers safe.  Is your husband going to watch him well enough that he doesn't wander into the woods, or down to the lake?  The man doesn't have the sense to treat *lake water* before he drinks it.  You aren't confident he'll bring your child home in one piece, and unfortunately that sounds damn reasonable.\n\nI don't think an out and out confrontation is going to go the way you want, though.  Saying  \"I absolutely forbid it\" is a nuclear move.  If he says \"Too bad, I'm doing it anyway\", what's your next move?  \n\nI get the vibe you do most of the caring for your son.  How involved is your husband in the day to day routine?  Does he know all your son's little rituals - his favourite toy, plate, clothes, bedtime routine?  How to cook meals he enjoys?  Help with his bath and nappies/ toileting?  Because if the answer is \"no\", there's your pressure point.  \n\nExplain that routine is incredibly important to toddlers, and if he just whisks your son off to the cabin without any preparation, it's going to be extremely miserable for both of them.  *For your son's benefit*, your husband needs to gradually take over his daily care so that it's not too jarring a change.  \n\nStart with him joining you in the bedtime routine, then working up to you going away for a weekend and leaving them alone together.  Because if your husband can't deal with a solo weekend with your toddler in their own home, a solo weekend in a crusty bat infested cabin is going to be a nightmare for all involved.  \n\nThere's three likely outcomes. \n\n1.  Your husband steps up, proves himself competent, becomes closer to your son, allays all your fears and the two of them have a wonderful bonding weekend\n\n2.  He realises the weekend would be a LOT more work than he's willing to do and quietly drops the idea\n\n3.  He neither steps up nor gives up the idea.  \n\nIf you get 3, you're still ahead of where you'd be if you  go Nuclear right now.  You can point to (more) concrete examples of why it's a bad idea.  You've put the focus on your son's comfort and safety, rather than simply calling him a shitty parent.  You were reasonable, sensible and have the high ground.  It's much more difficult for your husband or his supporters to make you the bad guy. \n\nSome people might see this as manipulative, that you're setting your husband up to fail.  It's not.  You're trying to ensure your son *and husband* have a positive experience on their cabin trip.  If your husband fails at *basic parenting in his own home*, that's not your fault. \n\nPlan what you'll do if he DOES insist on this trip without preparation.  I think it would be VERY dangerous.", "Kid died in Florida from rabies. Children are much more susceptible to rabies than adults are. And they don't know not to touch creepy crawlies and they may not even tell you they've been bit. Spiders are another problem. While rare, they do come in to find warmth and have a way of crawling into blankets. Guess what happens then? It gets infected and your baby has a big scar and open wound. No fun.", "NTA the trip alone would keep anybody with an intact brain from doing it with a toddler.", "NTA\n\nThat's just irresponsible. Very. If anything goes awry with the toddler? He's a long way from any help. Given it sounds remote and toddlers get into everything? There actually is a definite chance of something going badly. The child being bitten by something etc\n\nStick to you guns. DO NOT let him take a small child to such a place. Nope. No way.\n\nfwiw. I'm from Outback Australia and grew up remotely. I know the risks and dangers of remote places. I'm sensible. MOst country people are. It's just common sense to weigh up pros and cons and try to minimize dangers as much as possible. for example. I would take my kids to a decent propery / house in the Outback...but I wouldn't take them camping!", "Wow not the a hole. The kid is afraid of flies this is fucking serious.", "Absolutely not . \n\nThat Cabin is a safety hazard in every sense of the word ! Not only is it incredibly isolated from everything and I\u2019m guessing a lot of people , so I\u2019m the event your son or husband need medical care they are SOL .", "Nta I\u2019d call the police for kidnapping if he even tries it, it\u2019s not somewhere to take a 2 year old from the sounds of it", "Yes, OP, if he's serious about taking your child there without your consent, you should remind him that you can call the police on him if he does it. It's kidnapping (idk if everywhere allows defining kidnapping by one parent running off with the child, but some places do), and it's endangering and neglecting a very young child.", "Totally agree! Your husband has his head up his ass and is getting carried away with his own childhood nostalgia vs. thinking like a responsible parent! He\u2019s acting from that exact childhood place and throwing a literal tantrum because he can\u2019t get his way. As others have said, taking your little one without your consent could absolutely be considered kidnapping. What is his problem?? He needs to take a breath, take a step back, and think about how he can make his nostalgic vision a reality by putting some work into the cabin and prepping it for the next generation to safely enjoy. Yikes.", "Yeah. Not very smart, IF they were forced to drink Lake water, everyone should know to boil the F out of it first.", "Quit being dramatic? Are you an actual dunce? Cause ya sure do seem like it.

A toddler getting food poisoning (norovirus or the like) with no medical care nearby would be a very serious thing. Would he just be like \"guess Jimmy wasn't tough enough for our duck dynasty lifestyle?\"", "This isn't a cabin problem, it's a relationship problem\n\nNow I'm not gonna pretend that money can't ever fix relationship problems. Money can solve countless logistical issues that create or exacerbate relationship problems. Money can pay for therapy. Money can solve other kinds of stressors and issues in your life that make relationships harder\n\nBut money has its limits\n\nAll it does here is serve to express the depth of his not giving a flying fuck\n\nHow many years of visits and disasters did she experience? And he never once took it seriously enough to fix the property up. He didn't do it before taking her up there. He didn't do it after the first disaster experience. Or the second. Or the third\n\nHell he didn't even do the shit that people without that kind of money do. Her first trip there she gets sick because they're drinking unfiltered lake water. Are you freaking kidding me? This mans not even buying bottled water? \n\nHe loves the place. He wants to share that with her. And yet every time she comes she's not only miserable but made physically ill due to basic safety issues. And he does nothing\n\nThen they have a kid, a child he really wants to experience and love the cabin and have amazing childhood memories there. And he does nothing\n\nHe has had a million opportunities to do something about the cabin but didn't. Logistics wasn't the issue, finances weren't the issue\n\nSo it's hard not to come away with the conclusion that he didn't do anything because he doesn't actually care about the safety and well-being of his wife and child\n\nMaybe he's somehow foolish enough to think that none of these things are *actually* dangerous because he didn't die so what's the harm? Like boomers bragging about how they survived without seat belts. But that's still a massive disregard for the well-being of people he loves. And frankly if he is that foolish, he shouldn't be left alone with a toddler because he can't protect them. You cannot proactively protect someone from dangers you refuse to recognise\n\nAnd all that's BEFORE he threatens to take their toddler son out of the country, without her consent (kidnapping), and take him somewhere that he's done nothing to make safe for adults, much less a toddler\n\nThis is not a cabin problem, it's a relationship problem\n\nAnd it's the type of relationship problem that money can only solve one way: hiring fucking lawyers", "He\u2019s an assh*le", "Maybe, but he certainly fucking sealed the deal by not fixing it up earlier\n\nPeople are generally willing to tolerate a certain amount of discomfort to make their loved ones happy. They're especially willing to do this if that discomfort is paired with enjoyable experiences. Just on an incredibly selfish level, if something that was really important to me, something that I really wanted to share, made someone I loved miserable, I would be highly invested in fixing that\n\nYou try and identify the biggest sources of their discomfort and address them, especially if addressing it doesn't negatively impact your experience in any way. And on some stuff you probably compromise\n\nYour partner doesn't especially love camping. Maybe that means putting some extra effort into making the sleeping arrangements more comfortable for them even though you're not thrilled about that. Maybe it means bringing foods they really love. Maybe that means scheduling trips to avoid weather that makes them especially miserable\n\nThis guy can't even bother to address actual safety issues\n\nNot only do I care about the safety of my loved ones, but getting sick from drinking unfiltered water may change how they feel about the experience I want them to enjoy and be willing to repeat yearly\n\nGetting bit by a bat while sleeping indoors and having to spend hours trying to get emergency medical care and then having to return to the ER repeatedly for more injections is gonna put a fucking damper on things\n\nAnd not only are these experiences likely to significantly change how she sees the place, but that he doesn't take these issues seriously and do anything about it is also going to change how much she trusts him and how she experiences the place. If she's sitting around just waiting for the other shoe to drop, even if nothing goes wrong, she's gonna be miserable\n\nMaybe she'd never have really liked the place but he did just about everything possible to ensure she hates it.
