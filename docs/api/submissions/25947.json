This cottage is in another country (it's in Canada, we are from the US), so on top of it being a 4.5 hour flight away, it requires a 3 hour drive and then a 30+ minute ferry ride, as the cottage is located on an island that is ONLY accessible by boat. Last time we stayed at the cottage, there was no hot shower water for the entire 5 days. Before that, I was exposed to bats in the sleeping room and had to drive to New York to get vaccinated for rabies. Before that trip, we lost power and had no hot water and I had food poisoning (the water is unfiltered from the lake). It's always something going wrong and I'm just so, so, sick of it. I told him I'd stay for 2-3 nights next year, but I don't want to stay 5 nights again. It's also very difficult with a toddler who never sleeps through the night. This cottage means a lot to my husband (he has fond memories of being there with his family and friends when growing up), but it has always been a source of intense anxiety and discomfort for me. From the bugs, to the bats, to the lack of basic amenities (we often lose power or hot water), I just always get stressed and dread being there. Every single year I dread it. My husband knows this and has been working on \"fixing up\" the cottage, but it's just very uncomfortable for me and he knows this. I have put up with it for years but I'm tired and want to limit how long I will stay there in the future. \n\n Now he is threatening to take our 2.5 year old son there for a week+ without me, which I find unacceptable. I have never threatened to take our son anywhere without his consent, much less to another country. Our son is afraid of flies (screams and cries whenever they get near) and doesn't sleep through the night. I don't think he will enjoy this trip that he's too young to consent to, especially with his mom gone. \n\nAITA for telling my husband that I won't allow him to take my son to a different country without my consent?", "created_utc": 1693503701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166hnhq/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_take_our_toddler/", "score": 861, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bats that bite you in the night requiring that you drive to New York for rabies shots (yikes!) Untreated water that causes food poisoning. \n\nThis is not a safe place for a 2.5 year old. Period.\n\nIf your husband wants to make this the family getaway every year then HE needs to get off his butt and put some energy into fixing the place up FIRST. So he needs to fix the water situation, and if the water that comes into the house can't be made safe, then he needs to ensure there is enough bottled water for everyone to use. He needs to get the cabin completely sealed up so that no bats can get in. If he says \"that's impossible\" then he can go there on his own and be a wild grizzly mountain man, but it's not a safe place for wife and toddler. Sorry, dude. Wtf? I would make a list of what needs fixing at the cottage, and ask him to make the repairs or pay someone to make the repairs and once the cabin is safe for human habitation, then you and your son will go spend time there, not before.", "NTA\n\nIt's a remote island cabin. If something goes wrong, help is *not* getting there in time. And OP elsewhere in the comments posts that her husband has ignored issues with their son multiple times and those issues turned out to be legit after a visit to the doc's office, therefore, she doesn't fully trust his judgment in situations where something might be going wrong with a kid.\n\nI mean, in a general sense it is assholish to *forbid* a spouse from doing something. But in this case it's justified, and perhaps is even her duty as a parent.\n\nBesides, kids don't really start to form memories that last until sometime after 3...", "NTA  \nIf there is a legitimate health concern (unfiltered water, no heat without sufficent other heat sources, rabies, etc.) Then it would be very irresponsible to take a child younger than 5 there for an extended period, especially without both parents.\n\nAdditionally, threatening to take a child somewhere against the wishes of the other parent is a dickish thing to do without extreme extenuating circumstances. \"I wanted to\" is not extreme extenuating circumstances.\n\nThat being said, if he really wants to go, and you would be willing to for a short period, I would advise treating it more like a camping trip (bringing extra heaters, sleeping bags, backup power/propane stove/etc) and possibly staying in a hotel with the kiddo for a day or two/flying out later so he can get there and clean out any pest creatures first. This is clearly important to him, so it's a good idea to be flexible, but make it clear that if he tries to take your child out of the country you're GOING to have an issue with that", "NTA. The multiple incidences of guests at this cottage needing rabies shots due to contact with bats, the unfiltered water, and the remote location make this appropriate for adults and older kids only. A toddler can't tell an adult if a bat landed on him or accurately describe symptoms of illness. These are legitimate safety concerns. One day your son and husband can spend father son time in the batty buggy luxury-free North, but not yet.", "If there are bats living in the cabin, then bat guano is my #1 concern. It\u2019s dangerous for respiratory problems. \n\nBeyond rabies, bats also carry other nasty infectious issues. \n\nThis is a hard NO. \n\nLet him go alone. Spend the week working to fix the place up. Once it\u2019s actually inhabitable then you can consider it.", "NTA. Wtf is up with your husband **threatening to abscond with your child** to a remote and potentially dangerous cabin outside of the country? That\u2019s like instant-divorce words. It\u2019s literally illegal for your husband to take your son out of the country without your consent. Maybe let him know that. \n\n*** anyone that wants to argue the cabin isn\u2019t potentially dangerous, spare me. If anything goes wrong there\u2019s no way they\u2019re getting any level of medical attention in less than an hour, and the cabin has bats and unclean water. Not a suitable or safe place for a toddler.", "Omg NTA even a little. I can't believe some of these comments!! Bats don't have to be symptomatic to expose humans to rabies. If one even gets in your house, doctors recommend rabies shots, let alone if one actually bites you. And I'm sorry, but lack of POTABLE WATER would be a full stop no for me - if mom got food poisoning from the water, little guy is that much more susceptible. Plus when she expresses discomfort with the idea, dad threatens to take him anyway?! Insane. Major parenting decisions like this are two yeses one no.", "NTA.\n\nNot only would your son likely not enjoy it, he certainly won't remember it.\n\nYou are aware that a minor child is not supposed to leave the US with just 1 parent without written, notarized consent of the other parent?", "I would let him take the toddler because after a few days and nights of screaming he wont rush to do.it agsin...", "NTA. I think you are right to be concerned, as it sounds like a lot can go wrong, and traveling with a toddler can be trying at the best of times. It's sounds so isolated in case of an emergency.\n\nAnd frankly, if you hate the cabin so much, just stop going! Don't \"put up with it\" for 2-3 days. Just don't go.\n\nMy dad would take us camping w/o mother at times (she didn't like camping). But we were older...5th/6th grade.\n\nUnless one goes camping a lot, and knows how to deal with things, I wouldn't take a toddler that young on such a trip.", "What the fuck, unfiltered lake water? That\u2019s just stupid and lazy. Take some freakin purification tablets. Boil it. Buy a water filter. Something.\n\nNTA. The cabin and remoteness aren\u2019t the problem. Sharing the cabin and the drinking water with wildlife is the problem.", "If your kid has never been so much as camping overnight, then a week effectively camping in a cottage in the middle of nowhere is unlikely to be a great introduction.\n\nBut for people in a relationship, you two don't seem to be doing very much talking to each other, so I'll call you ESH.", "YTA \n\nYour son will probably enjoy being at the cottage without his mother freaking out over every little thing.   \n\nBuy them a brita filter for the drinking and cooking water, and ease up a bit.   You seem to be wound super tight.", "YTA \n\nI get that most of Reddit will side with you but it isn\u2019t unsafe, at all, your just very demanding with your creature comforts. What really bothers me is you forcing your neuroses on your kid. Suck it up and spend a week at your husbands childhood cabin. By all means help make improvements so you feel better and more comfortable but bailing on it because you have to go a week without TikTok is bad, forcing your kid to go without is worse.\n\nGod so much of this is terrible, you acting so entitled with a luxury unavailable to 99% of people on earth, forcing those unjustifiable fears (flies? Seriously) on your children. \n\nNobody would side with you if they had the full context of the situation", "YTA. You aren\u2019t making any effort to compromise with him because YOU don\u2019t like the cabin. Most of the things you mention are no big deal to handle - no hot water? So what? You can heat water on whatever cooking method is used or over a campfire. No power is the same thing - so what, plenty of campers deal with that on the regular. If it\u2019s close enough to the US border to drive to NY then it also isn\u2019t in the back of beyond, so emergency evacuation is quite possible via helicopter or similar. \n\nThe only thing that is at all a concern is the bats, but you aren\u2019t talking to him about how to address that issue, as I\u2019m sure it can be dealt with.", "YTA. You sound much too precious about yourself and now you're projecting onto your husband and son. If your husband wants to take your son and will take all due care to keep him fed, healthy and happy there really shouldn't be an issue. BTW, what does \"exposed to bats\" mean to the point of you needing a rabies shot?", "Lol yes your the a YTA \u2026 don\u2019t go if you\u2019re miserable but why stop them ? Do you think he\u2019s gonna stay there forever?", "YTA, commenters saying NTA are babies. He is trying to create similar childhood memories as he had and you are ruining that opportunity by being scared of roughing it a little.", "Honestly I think this is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. It seems like your hatred for the cabin is clouding your perception and leaving your husband few options to enjoy his hobby with his son, and your husband is pushing back too hard. I do think the situation you describe is a veto-power one (both parents should be on board) but I just don\u2019t get any sense that you are or trying to want to make this work. \n\nAnd now you\u2019re playing tug of war with your son. I think you two need more than an AITA judgement.", "NTA\n\nYou not liking the place aside, why would your husband want to take a tiny tot that doesn't sleep through the night there? Sounds miserable. I know he is excited to share this cabin and memories with his kid but he is just to young right now. \n\nI had a very similar story to this actually. A friend of our family has a similar cabin on a lake in Canada. On an island, can only get there by boat, hot water is a maybe along with electricity. My father, younger sister and I went with them one summer. I was in 2nd maybe 3rd grade. I don't know because *I remember very little about the trip*. Even with the help of photographs I just do not have many concrete memories of the place and what I do have might be made up. \n\nI know I had a good time, milk in a bag was so odd to my American ways. I remember the leeches on my legs from the lake and how bitter cold the water was even in summer. \n\nBut I don't remember much more than smells (pine trees) or sensations (freezing cold water seeping through my tiny wetsuit). And I wasn't 2.5 years old. \n\nIt would just be a waste of time and energy and your husband would probably not enjoy himself as much as he thinks.", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nI would be extremely hestitant about  bringing a LO so young, to such a difficult place to get to and stay at.\n\nThe cabin must be a very important place for your husband. Is there any way to explain to him that your LO is too young to actually *participate* in the various cabin activities? If he can wait until your kiddo is 6 or 7, he'd be richly rewarded.\n\nPlus, is your husband aware of the shenanigans a toddler can get into? I'm talking about unsafe, dangerous, risky stuff...", "YTA!", "YTA for the way you've framed this.\n\nHe's going to Canada, not North Korea. He's not \"threatening,\" he's saying what he wants to do. You're acting like he intends to kidnap your kid for Pete's sake. \n\nYou've expressed your hatred for the place and you refuse to go. So don't. Your son doesn't sleep through the night = not your problem. No showers = everyone will be stinky for awhile. WTF cares? The only real health issue you identified is the bats. Has that been dealt with? If so--you should let them go and have a relaxing time by yourself while they're out roughing it.", "YTA. You don\u2019t like going there. Your husband found a solution. You stay home. Unless you\u2019re legitimately concerned that your husband is going to forget to feed or change the kid, let him take his son to his cabin. They are probably going to be spending time there throughout the kid\u2019s childhood. Look at it as a week to yourself. Read a book, binge Netflix, relax.", "YTA. Roughing it has been happening since the beginning of the human race. No different than camping.", "What is going to happen? Really what\u2019s going to happen?

If anything, he will learn how good he has it back in the city.\n\nAlso, wow all these commentators are just weak. 5 days without electricity or being a little cold doesn\u2019t kill anyone. I would switch dangerous with uncomfortable.", "YTA.  What a bunch of helicopter mom doomsday bullshit. Probably far more likely to have a incident requiring medical care at home, hit by a bus, etc.", "YTA- as a Canadian camper your son will be fine especially this time of year. Also Canada has a treaty with the US, you don\u2019t have to worry about him taking your kid and not bringing him back. We are not some foreign country. \n\nBut let\u2019s discuss the cottage shall we, so based on what you\u2019re saying I have a feeling it\u2019s near or around Manitoulin Island, you are exaggerating about how remote it is. I\u2019m thinking Georgian Bay Area? This time of year the bugs are done, so that is a stupid argument. Also shall we discuss the other multimillion dollar cottages in the area.\n\nListen you don\u2019t like camping, here are things that will make it more enjoyable.\n1. Always bring your own water, you had what we like to call beaver fever. You can fill it at the local Home Hardware on you way to the cottage. Use this water for cooking and to consume. Always!!!! \n2. Your husband needs to invest in a good Honda generator. They are quiet easy to run, and run for hours.\n3. Buy citronella oil bug spray for you and kiddo, and buy a bug zapper that looks like a tennis racket, you can find them at one of the many outfitters along the way. Also bring children\u2019s allergy meds, not Benadryl something like reactine or Claritin. If you child has a bad reaction to bug bites, this will clear it up.\n4. And one suggestion is your hubby goes and opens the cottage ahead of time, maybe send him a week beforehand to air it out, clean it. So when you come it\u2019s more comfortable for you. \n\nListen just because you hate it, doesn\u2019t give you the right to take that experience away from your child. Going to the cottage is the few times in life when kids can really disconnect from the internet and be kids.  Your son is very lucky to be able to have that experience.", "NAH - no assholes here IMO. You hate the cabin and have concerns about how your kid is going to take it, husband wants to expose your kid to new experiences. Let this be a FAFO experience for your husband - f*ck around and find out. You\u2019ve expressed your concerns you think your child is going to have a difficult time, and your husband wants to insist on them going. Let them. How much do you want to bet that on hour 3 of a screaming toddler who doesn\u2019t want to sleep is going to change his mind fast and they\u2019ll be home earlier than planned? \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wrong and kiddo learns to love it and enjoy the new experience? Great! Daddy/toddler bonding experience, mom gets a mini vacation. Win/win all around.", "NTA - the water issues are bad enough, but now your mother-in-law is getting rabies vaccines as well because of bad exposure there? I'm terrified he would take your son, and with his cavalier attitude, refuse to even acknowledge If the child was bitten and would fail to get him care. Then you are left having to take this kid for rabies shots every time he goes to that cabin. I promise, you do that more than once, and the kid will throw such a screaming fit that your husband won't even be able to get him in the car!", "I just want to ask. What would the difference be if he was in Canada vs the other side of the US?", "This cabin legit sounds like the house I grew up in, in Canada. Travel insurance exists for medical emergencies, you can haul potable water to the cabin on the ferry. They also sell water purification tablets to make drinking water available. There is literally a solution to each problem you listed. You can have your child vaccinated for rabies before the trip. And also, a parent wanting to take their child somewhere isn\u2019t a threat. Quit being so damn dramatic.", "YTA. Okay, can we stop saying foreign country as though you would expect the Mounties to team up with Samoli pirates? You have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed about vaccinations and clean drinking water so make sure you kid is vaccinated and your husband uses a water filtration system for all drinking and cooking uses.", "YTA. Dad wants to share something he loves with his child. There are bats all over the USA. Canada has vaccines. Canada also has air ambulances.", "NTA. Since you and your husband are still married and both custodial parents, I'm not sure if it's legally wrong to take your son out of the country but it's morally wrong to do it without your consent. Where is your son's passport - can you secure it?\n\nYour concerns are not unfounded. The cabin is not safe for a toddler. It's alarming that your husband doesn't see that and that his love for this cabin is outweighing his love and responsibility as a parent. \n\nI would die on this hill and make counseling a requirement for the health of your marriage.", "YTA for using the word \u201cletting\u201d in this context. Your shared child is not only yours to consent or not to travel. It comes off as condescending and controlling. \n\nEither you have chosen to have a child with a responsible adult or you haven\u2019t. Parents absolutely parent differently, and that\u2019s a good thing. Dad being a bit more lax while camping is not damaging. Hot showers while camping are not required. Many people camp off grid all the time. A little bit of dirt is good for both the immune system and resilience. Dealing with mosquitos is part of life and I\u2019m sure some bug spray is available. And ensuring that only bottled or imported water is used is a reasonable compromise. Food poisoning can happen, and while not at all fun, is usually a relatively minor issue. \n\nBut if you\u2019ve gotten yourself into a situation where you can\u2019t trust your husband to parent appropriately, that\u2019s your biggest problem. \n\nMost of your complaints are not serious \n\nBats in or around the cottage are two different things.

I think you\u2019re just a drama queen. \n\nAnd about the water. You can\u2019t drink it if you\u2019re not used to it. Your husband probably can because he grew up with it. To bad you got sick. But why not just bring bottled water for you and for cooking?\n\nI just think your a spoiled city girl who can\u2019t stand to be out in the nature without all that you are used to from home. \n\nBut why take the experience away from your child just because you don\u2019t like it?", "Yta", "YTA for the language you use.

If that is the case, why did you have a child with him?", "NTA. Outside of all safety concerns, there is absolutely nothing for your kid there.

This cottage is in another country (it's in Canada, we are from the US), so on top of it being a 4.5 hour flight away, it requires a 3 hour drive and then a 30+ minute ferry ride, as the cottage is located on an island that is ONLY accessible by boat. Last time we stayed at the cottage, there was no hot shower water for the entire 5 days. Before that, I was exposed to bats in the sleeping room and had to drive to New York to get vaccinated for rabies. Before that trip, we lost power and had no hot water and I had food poisoning (the water is unfiltered from the lake). It's always something going wrong and I'm just so, so, sick of it. I told him I'd stay for 2-3 nights next year, but I don't want to stay 5 nights again. It's also very difficult with a toddler who never sleeps through the night. This cottage means a lot to my husband (he has fond memories of being there with his family and friends when growing up), but it has always been a source of intense anxiety and discomfort for me. From the bugs, to the bats, to the lack of basic amenities (we often lose power or hot water), I just always get stressed and dread being there. Every single year I dread it. My husband knows this and has been working on \"fixing up\" the cottage, but it's just very uncomfortable for me and he knows this. I have put up with it for years but I'm tired and want to limit how long I will stay there in the future. \n\n Now he is threatening to take our 2.5 year old son there for a week+ without me, which I find unacceptable. I have never threatened to take our son anywhere without his consent, much less to another country. Our son is afraid of flies (screams and cries whenever they get near) and doesn't sleep through the night. I don't think he will enjoy this trip that he's too young to consent to, especially with his mom gone. \n\nAITA for telling my husband that I won't allow him to take my son to a different country without my consent?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "If you are concerned about rabies, have your 2 year old vaccinated.

If you are concerned about flies, bring a fly swatter or fly paper.  Honestly, doesn't sound worse than camping.  I think you should take a family trip and both of you work on fixing up the cabin and showing your kid that roughing it can be fun!", "No. And the biggest problem being, if the baby has a medical problem, there is no where to go and no way to get to anywhere else on a reasonable amount of time.", "Yta.

The bats thing is really worrying as rabies is still fatal if not treated and a small child may not have the words to tell you they've been bitten. Bats aside, the lack of clean water, heat, and electricity make this a rustic experience that only a seasoned camper or someone looking to truly \"rough it\" would enjoy.

Could he even manage a fussy toddler for a week, with all that travel, by himself?", "Soft YTA. You don't want to go, you don't have to go.
