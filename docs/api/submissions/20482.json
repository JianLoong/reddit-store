You didn\u2019t go for a joy ride, rev the engine, go through anything, change settings, etc. You snapped pictures of their nephew to make him happy that he could sit in a cool car. It was impossible to predict that this would have been their reaction to this situation. With this said, like adults, this could have been easily resolved with a simple discussion about boundaries since you already apologized. No harm, no foul. Yet, lesson learned is that your SIL has different boundaries than your family when it comes to personal property/possessions. Going forward, just let your son know that auntie would like to be asked first before taking pictures with her awesome luxury privileges. Furthermore, if you catch non-verbal communication that you and your family aren\u2019t genuinely wanted around, set a boundary for yourself that you and your fam with either stay at nearby lodging or pass on the opportunity.

When you decided to do it without permission, you also removed the opportunity for her to share her cool thing. Adults aren't that different from children except we have more sophisticated ways of getting in trouble-taking away someone's show-and-tell robs a little joy they might have in sharing it themselves.

He used someone else\u2019s belongings without asking permission, obtaining consent, or even giving warning.

It\u2019s not their responsibility to tell you to leave things that aren\u2019t yours alone.

Like maybe SIL might have said yes to \u2018a\u2019 photo if they asked politely and respectfully, and even if she said no, they\u2019d still be at the beach house.
