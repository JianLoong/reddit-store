Not a big ask.", "\"My ex has now started harassing me and my employer that we should figure out a way to get him to work.\" Tell them you have, it's called having basic hygiene and not dumping garbage in your vehicle. NTA in any way", "NTA, his own poor choices are his problems alone.", "NTA\n\nYou put someone in a position to succeed, and they are choosing not to take the opportunity seriously. You told him exactly what the problems are, and he refuses to do anything about them. \n\nWhat else can you really do? It's frustrating when this kind of thing happens, but it happens.", "NTA. It\u2019s a sad situation, the kid may need professional help, but you don\u2019t have an obligation to facilitate it.", "Is his situation sad? Yes. Are you the asshole? No. Tell the kid to wash his ass and his cloths, it's fucking gross.", "NTA\n\nHe either needs to realize that he is isolating himself with his stench, or he knows what he is doing and is doing it out of depression or some other reason. I am so sensitive to this-I feel your pain. I can't tolerate it.", "NTA. You don't owe him a ride.", "NTA - First of all you don't have to drive your ex's son regardless of his scent and habits, but yeah with those in mind you are 100% not the A.", "NTA, it\u2019s possible he\u2019s clinically depressed. He needs help and acting as of nothing is wrong won\u2019t fix it.", "NTA - the fix is so simple. He is being a pig human and there is absolutely no good reason (physical disability, language barrier, no access to a shower or clean clothes) for this. It's a hard lesson, but there is no path forward unless he learns it.", "More info: has anyone had a talk with him? Does he realize how big of an issue it is? I recently had to call a store I frequent to complain about the cashier having such bad body odor that I couldn\u2019t stand there until he got my things ring up; when I called they said it\u2019s been an issue for a while but after I told them that someone needs to have a talk with him and TELL him, he has been there and hasn\u2019t stunk like that again. People can\u2019t always smell themselves. If no one has tried to talk to him, it\u2019s a different story than if he realizes.", "NTA if he's under the age of 18, he is ex's problem; if over, he is his own problem.

He laughed and said \"i manage his fuel receipts, hes honest.\" And hung up on her.

I'm a woman, I live alone and work from home, and sometimes I go two (even three!) days without a shower if I don't have to leave the house or see anyone. But I know I'm a bit smelly and greasy after 48 hours and I feel like the only person in the world who doesn't shower daily or twice daily and enjoy it (I really don't like showers, it's a minor sensory issue but mostly just feels like a chore - plus long hair, it's wet and annoying for hours.)\n\nNot showering for weeks at a time is really dysfunctional and I'd be concerned about his state of mind. Doesn't mean you have to give him a ride to work (or not fire him - if he's making the workplace awful for everyone else, that's not cool) but something is up there.", "NTA. And I get why she is your ex."]}
