His failure to accept your backing out of an earlier promise leaves him seeming like an entitled individual. His arguing and his long text were way out of line.\n\nYou, for your responses, which come off as needlessly judgmental of his family, how many people are in it, and how their kids behave..  I fail to see how the guest list -- which either would have been the same across both sites or which needed a change of venue to accommodate everyone -- should have been relevant to your decorating plans.  You could have used materials and made decorations where their survival does not matter. After all, the party and the people being honored are supposed to be the center of attention, not the decorations.

Its sounding like you volunteered your time, money, and supplies for one thing but then without even consulting you the situation completely changed. It's a bit unfair of them to expect you to deliver all the same things after a big change like that.\n\nHowever, is it possible to find a compromise? Maybe still help but not to the full extent that you originally planned and have them chip in a little more money for the cost. Like they buy the supplies for you to make new arrangements or something? I mean doing something like that is totally optional and whether you do or not doesn't effect my NTA vote, I'm just one of those people who like compromise lol", "Im still making the cake that was originally my compromise though I see what you mean. I\u2019ll ask some of my contacts maybe I can buy a cheaper dinner set and offer it to them. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a"]}
