I walked out of a restaurant without paying for drinks, and left a bad review implying the waitress was ableist.", "selftext": "This happened last night. Me (26M) and my boyfriend A (23M) decided to go out to eat because we didn\u2019t feel like cooking. We went to a local place where we\u2019ve had good experiences in the past. \n\nFor context, A is deaf and we both speak ASL. He does talk but it can be hard to understand what he\u2019s saying sometimes, especially if you\u2019re not used to it. \n\nAnyways the waitress (50s F) came and asked what we wanted to drink. A got a soda and I got water. That being said the bill was probably under $3 at this point. \n\n5 minutes later the waitress came back to take our order. I told her mine, then A told her what he wanted. She looked confused and said \u201cwhat?\u201d So A said his order again but also pointed to it on the menu. \n\nHe kept pointing but the lady would not look and just got more confused. This went back and forth a couple of times before she rolled her eyes and said to me \u201ccan you just tell me what he wants, I have other tables.\u201d \n\nI said \u201che\u2019s literally pointing at it\u201d and told her what he was saying. She asked me what kind of cheese, so I signed to A asking what kind he wanted. \n\nWhen we were signing the waitress sighed loudly and gave us a really pissed look while putting her hands on her hips. Keep in mind it would take about 10 seconds to ask him. Then she said \u201ccome on\u201d under her breath. \n\nI thought it was really rude and the lady was being unreasonably impatient. I didn\u2019t want to deal with this lady for the rest of dinner, so I just said \u201cactually we\u2019ll go somewhere else\u201d \nI signed to A that I wanted to leave so we got up and started walking out. \n\nThe waitress yelled at us that we had to pay for our drinks, but I just ignored her. I admit that was probably wrong of me, but it\u2019s not like we walked out after we got our food. The only thing we got was a soda and water. \n\nWhen we got in the car I was pretty mad. I used to work at a restaurant and I know waitressing is not an easy job. I don\u2019t expect them to kiss my ass, but I do expect people to take a couple extra seconds out of their day to accommodate a deaf person. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable. \n\nIn the heat of the moment I left a one star review on google. I basically just said what I did here. I didn\u2019t remember her name but I said she was a middle aged woman with blonde hair. I did call her out and also implied she was being ableist. \n\nThis morning I was thinking about it, and considered deleting my review. As rude as she was I don\u2019t want to cause anyone to loose their job or get in trouble. I\u2019m still not sure, was I justified or am I the ass hole?", "created_utc": 1677528481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dlesx/aita_i_walked_out_of_a_restaurant_without_paying/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\n\nThe restaurant might be out $3 in soda, but you gave the owner and manager an invaluable review.", "NTA. It sounds like you didn't even drink the drinks, and they cost cents to the restaurant. \n\nShe was definitely rude and impatient. I mean how often do people hm and haw at the menu when the waitress is there? That seems more annoying than trying to understand a deaf person's order, yet it's an accommodation made all the time.", "NTA - she was rude AF. Absolutely no reason to act like that to anyone ever. I would have left without paying for a soda too. And left a bad review.", "NTA. You didn't even have the opportunity to enjoy your drinks due to the ableism. Don't delete your review, she was being discriminatory and rude.", "NTA. I wouldn't have paid for the soda either. I order a soda to enjoy with my meal. If there's no meal then the soda was pointless. It cost them like cents per soda anyways.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't causing anyone to possibly lose their job. That's on her. You did the right thing and should definitely leave the review.", "Maybe she couldn't read ;-)\n\nNTA", "NTA. The soda is worth 10 cents, the restaurant will be fine.", "NTA - and she can pay the $3 for your drinks for being a jerk.", "NTA. And you don\u2019t owe them for the drink. It isn\u2019t like you sat there milking a drink and then refused to pay. You were discriminated against and treated poorly resulting in you walking out. Even if he\u2019d finished the one on the table, that\u2019s on her. Leave the review and she deserves to be fired.", "NTA, if you had sat there for a multi course meal and walked out on a $100 bill, then I would have voted differently, but walking out on sodas is not a big deal given the way the waitress was acting.", "NTA\n\nYou cost them $0.10 worth of soda but she cost them a repeat customer.", "NTA but I would suggest calling to find out when the owner would be there, go back to pay for the drinks, and tell the owner exactly what happened. If they care about their business at all, they need to talk to that waitress.", "NTA. I\u2019d be petty and ask her if she could read.  I would have even called the restaurant the next day to complain. She may have just been having a bad day in general, but still no excuse for how she treated you and your friend. \n   Sorry your friend went thought that. There is no reason they should ever have issues ordering from a restaurant.", "NTA\n\nShe was ableist and rude. It took 3 seconds to look on the menu to understand what your bf wanted to eat.", "NTA. Soda and water cost cents, if the business wants everyone's money then they need to be accessible and not discriminatory.", "NTA. That person sucks. I do think a call to restaurant management would be more effective than a Google Review, as this was a single waitress and (hopefully) not indicative of the entire establishment. If this was a small business I would consider taking it down, but I wouldn't say you're necessarily wrong for it either.", "Nta- don't feel bad about a thing. The waitress who was being daft can pay for your soda as a last act before she gets fired.", "NTA. I wouldn't have paid for the soda either.", "NTA. She absolutely was being albeist. That said, if it were me, I probably would have spoken with a manager and gotten the drinks squared away properly rather than just dashing out on them.", "NTA - I don\u2019t blame you for getting offended and needing to leave. I\u2019d leave your review up. I\u2019d also write an email to the restaurant.", "Nothing burns my biscuits more than being disrespected or being treated rudely when I'm spending money.\n\nIt does sound like she was being very rude to you and to your husband. There's no excuse for that. Sometimes things just take a little longer for whatever reason. Her job is to make you have an enjoyable time. It's really not a necessary service she should at least be kind.\n\nAs far as the review, that's up to you. I personally wouldn't. I would never want to get anybody fired. But her behavior was completely inappropriate\n\n\nEdit: I ABSOLUTELY would have left without paying for the drinks too!", "NTA. Walking out like that is a baller move, and I 'm super impressed. You should feel proud for taking such a stand. Don't feel ashamed for not paying for the soda. It's a low cost that the business can eat. Hopefully it'll bring their employee's bigotry to their attention. Think of it as 'compensation' for having to do DEI work for them.", "NTA!  This waitress showed terrible service skills.  She also contextually mixed easy cues making her ableist, and lacked the patience or wit to find a solution like MAYBE using a piece of paper.  A 1 star review is warranted.\n\nI have eaten with people using ASL, pointing at menu, and post it notes to order from a menu and it is pretty straightforward for competent waitstaff.", "NTA.\n\nShe was exceptionally rude and yes, ableist. You were fully justified in walking out. Soda and water cost them almost nothing, so I wouldn't worry about that at all. As for the review, it was earned by that service. And good restaurant managers will regularly go over their reviews on big sites, and try to reach out to unsatisfied customers. So keep an eye out for a reply to your review - you can always take it down if the manager lets you know they've handled the situation.", "Nta. Leave a review and call the place.

I was a server for years and can't imagine being that rude to a customer, esp one who literally couldn't help the communication barrier. Whenever I had deaf customers I would just get out my phone to use the notes app to communicate about whatever couldn't be resolved by pointing at the menu", "NTA.  About the only thing I would have done different is I would have asked to speak to management, but, like others have said, maybe you can call?", "NTA. Don't feel bad about not paying for the soda. It's the cheapest thing in the restaurant. They probably only lost a few pennies on it.", "NTA anyone who treats customers that way shouldn't be working in a restaurant anyway. If you do feel guilty about not paying maybe pop back to the restaurant explain everything to the manager and offer to pay the $3. They'll probably tell you not to worry about it.", "The amount of people getting hung up on three dollars on this page would make you think we're still in the 1920s. \n\n3 Dollars isn't even what it cost the restaurant to put that drink on the table. And if y'all are telling me you've not 'stolen' 3 dollars worth of something in your life then I'm a purple dinosaur. \n\nAlso NTA, nothing wrong with expecting to be treated with respect, and giving her the same respect she gave you.", "NTA this is a good reason to get reprimanded or fired. Otherwise you're enabling this treatment toward others. Leave the review up.", "NTA- you had previous good experiences at this place which means the issue is wth the waitress not the restaurant. Leaving a 1 star review will impact the restaurant. I\u2019d of started with the owner or manager first. I\u2019d definitely I\u2019ve followed it up", "NTA. Leave the review. If she's being an ableist dick, and it sounds like she is, she deserves to lose her job.", "NTA- How inconsiderate can a person be? I used to work in the service industry and it's horrible she treated you and your boyfriend so badly. I would've asked to speak to the manager because it is unacceptable.", "NTA, did A even finish his soda? If he barely drank any then you didn't steal anything anyway. Even if he mostly finished his drink the amount of money is insignificant. You were discriminated against and that waitress needs to be retrained or fired.
