I walked out of a restaurant without paying for drinks, and left a bad review implying the waitress was ableist.", "selftext": "This happened last night. Me (26M) and my boyfriend A (23M) decided to go out to eat because we didn\u2019t feel like cooking. We went to a local place where we\u2019ve had good experiences in the past. \n\nFor context, A is deaf and we both speak ASL. He does talk but it can be hard to understand what he\u2019s saying sometimes, especially if you\u2019re not used to it. \n\nAnyways the waitress (50s F) came and asked what we wanted to drink. A got a soda and I got water. That being said the bill was probably under $3 at this point. \n\n5 minutes later the waitress came back to take our order. I told her mine, then A told her what he wanted. She looked confused and said \u201cwhat?\u201d So A said his order again but also pointed to it on the menu. \n\nHe kept pointing but the lady would not look and just got more confused. This went back and forth a couple of times before she rolled her eyes and said to me \u201ccan you just tell me what he wants, I have other tables.\u201d \n\nI said \u201che\u2019s literally pointing at it\u201d and told her what he was saying. She asked me what kind of cheese, so I signed to A asking what kind he wanted. \n\nWhen we were signing the waitress sighed loudly and gave us a really pissed look while putting her hands on her hips. Keep in mind it would take about 10 seconds to ask him. Then she said \u201ccome on\u201d under her breath. \n\nI thought it was really rude and the lady was being unreasonably impatient. I didn\u2019t want to deal with this lady for the rest of dinner, so I just said \u201cactually we\u2019ll go somewhere else\u201d \nI signed to A that I wanted to leave so we got up and started walking out. \n\nThe waitress yelled at us that we had to pay for our drinks, but I just ignored her. I admit that was probably wrong of me, but it\u2019s not like we walked out after we got our food. The only thing we got was a soda and water. \n\nWhen we got in the car I was pretty mad. I used to work at a restaurant and I know waitressing is not an easy job. I don\u2019t expect them to kiss my ass, but I do expect people to take a couple extra seconds out of their day to accommodate a deaf person. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable. \n\nIn the heat of the moment I left a one star review on google. I basically just said what I did here. I didn\u2019t remember her name but I said she was a middle aged woman with blonde hair. I did call her out and also implied she was being ableist. \n\nThis morning I was thinking about it, and considered deleting my review. As rude as she was I don\u2019t want to cause anyone to loose their job or get in trouble. I\u2019m still not sure, was I justified or am I the ass hole?", "created_utc": 1677528481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dlesx/aita_i_walked_out_of_a_restaurant_without_paying/", "score": 441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
