By ordering her groceries so early in the day, at a time she knows she isn\u2019t at home, she is intentionally forcing you guys to take care of her stuff.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing a nice gesture for her, which does not benefit you in any way. Why would you be expected to get up and bring her stuff into her house when you aren't feeling well. \n\nMaaaaybe you could have messaged her and let her know you weren't feeling good beforehand but I still say NTA", "NTA, while a nice gesture, it's not your responsibility to be home for her packages. She should check with you to see if you're available for it before ordering something, not the day of delivery, so she can set up an alternate time or pick up point if you're not availably", "NTA: just because someone is typically available to collect her deliveries doesn't mean someone is always available. \n\nShe's come to the assumption that you or others in your family are always available for her to notify last minute.", "NTA - she can schedule stuff when she\u2019s at home, she can\u2019t just rely on other people for stuff like that if she wants everything to go right 100% of the time", "NTA. You aren't her personal sorting office. You won't always be available to collect her packages/deliveries and she has no right to harass you or your family if you aren't available for any reason, particularly since she's only a tenant.", "NTA. Her money, her choice, her parcel, her problem. She is clearly taking what you offered as a nice gesture as something for granted. It\u2019s not like you stole the parcel yourself or hired someone to steal it. She could have ditched work and driven home to pick it up but she chose not to. She chose to deliver it at this hour to inconvenience you instead. You and your mother were unwell and needed rest. There is no wrong in taking care of yourself first.", "NTA. But it would be nice to give her a heads-up that you won't always be available in the future so she can plan accordingly.", "NTA. Being unwell and sleeping through the doorbell is a perfectly legitimate excuse. I don't really think it's a huge offense to actively ignore a phone call when you're sick and you certainly don't bear any responsibility for the driver choosing to leave the parcel at the gate or the person choosing to steal it. \n\nI'm curious, has she actually had a go at you for this?", "NTA-you\u2019re doing her a favor. She should have given you a heads up ahead of time. Per your edits & responses, you weren\u2019t aware of the nature of her calls (intentionally, but still not aware). I\u2019m pretty sure one can schedule grocery delivery at specific times. She should have given you a heads up when it was scheduled, not when it arrived. She should not assume last minute would be fine & you\u2019d be home.", "NTA\n\nThe delivery driver who left it outside to be stolen is. There seems to be an expectation is you accept all their parcels while they are out, which of course in unreasonable for many reasons. \n\nCould say soft yta but as you said you were ill I'm willing to let you lie in bed and get some more rest. Overall delivery driver is AH. Friend could also be one but I think they are just annoyed something of theirs got stolen. \n\n>but part of me was annoyed because she ordered food so early and she only arrives home late afternoon, it didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThis also.\n\nYou aren't their reception you are their neighbour.", ">I told her not to feel bad to ask me for favors/help etc\n\nNTA.  She should have asked if you were available **before** she placed the order.  Just because you are usually home does not mean you are always available.\n\nAND, it was an AH move on her part to have groceries sent to your home.  That means you would have to sort through her groceries and make sure the frozen food and perishables were put in your freezer and fridge, putting more work on you.  If you still feel generous enough to take in her packages, tell her do not send groceries your way as it is an inconvenience.", "NTA - The tenant is following a risky strategy by having stuff delivered and assuming you will be there available without checking first.  This time it didn't work out, and they were lucky the times that it did work out.\n\nIt might be useful to tell them while you don't mind helping out in limited instances when you are given advanced notice, handling delivery cannot be a routine occurrence for you anymore. And for items like groceries, they should schedule deliveries later in the day when they are home.\n\nPicking up the packages, handling the communication about the packages, receiving multiple phone calls while you were home trying to sleep sick are all inconveniences for you and distractions from your work from home job.", "INFO.  Did you know groceries were being delivered before you shut your phone off and went back to sleep?  Yes, YTA.  No, NTA.", "As far as your tenant knows, your phone was on silent allll day. You can do that, you aren\u2019t a doctor on call. You can turn your phone off.\n\nThat\u2019s your story and you should stick to it. Just to avoid drama. How would your tenant even know you are lying. \n\nBut, yea, you should have gotten  your lazy and feeling unwell butt out of bed and gotten the package. How many yards would you have had to treck alll the way out to the gate to retrieve it. Just to be a courteous person. I roll my eyes. YTA", "You\u2019ve set the standard and the explicit expectation that you can be relied upon to perform a duty for your tenant. You chose to ignore them because you were napping. \n\nWhen you set an expectation and then fail to meet it, you break the trust that you built. When someone trusts you based on your behavioral history with them, that\u2019s not an unreasonable thing to do. \n\nYou broke that trust, on purpose, because you didn\u2019t feel like doing what it required.

Going against the grain here.

Given that, there\u2019s more complexity here. Surely OP isn\u2019t obliged to damage themselves and isn\u2019t on-call 100% of the time. At the same time, setting up an expectation like this informally can lead to problems when things break down, as in this case. I suppose that, in a situation like this, the onus was on the person who suffers when things break, so that would definitively promote OP to a non-AH", "That wasn't my question. Did you read (or listen to) her message? Did you know she was having something delivered and ignore it?", "What does \"No\" communicate that hanging up the phone does not?  Any plans the tenant would have made to correct the situation would be the same with either response.", "How is ESH? It isn't op responsibility to collect someone else's packages and last time I checked, you can actually schedule deliveries around times you will be home or even hold them at the facility to be picked up at your convenience. If it's groceries, you can actually set a drop off time as well.", "Nope, she sent a message with my name \nThen multiple missed calls", "OK, you asked....\n\nTenant was AH for scheduling delivery in the middle of the time that she (tenant) would not be home.  For reasons you state yourself.\n\nOP was AH for knowing there were groceries sitting outside, but turning off phone and going to sleep.  That was AH because (not surprisingly) groceries got up and walked away.  But even if they hadn't, it's likely that some food would have gone bad from being outside.\n\nWhile I understand it's not OP's responsibility to collect groceries for tenant, the time to discuss that with the tenant is long after the groceries have been properly stored.  It's a PITA, but deal with it now and talk about it later."]}
