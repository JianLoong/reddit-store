I don't think he minds them on other people, and has even thought about getting one himself, but he finds me more attractive without them. I have a couple times now wanted to get another one but didn't because he felt uncomfortable. Now I again want to get one (forearm tattoo) and he again would prefer I didn't. I've tried to compromise: I am getting two tattoos taken off so that the overall real estate (i.e. open skin) is not decreasing, and I am growing my hair out (he also prefers long hair cause it's more feminine) to try and balance things out. I am struggling to balance the \"my body my right\" vs. \"compromise in relationships\" (which I do really believe in compromise and he makes sacrifices for me so I should make some for him, right?).

But he doesnt have to like your tattoos. He\u2019s not doing anything other than having an opinion. He\u2019s not an AH for his opinion. \n\nIt is also most certainly your choice to get another if you want and youre not an AH for getting one even if your husband isn\u2019t a fan of them.", "Tattoo removal is long and painful and may not leave you with pristine skin. Unless you hate them, that\u2019s not a trade off. It\u2019s an expensive concession on your own body. \nNo verdict from me tho.", "But if I understood well, it\u2019s just that he would prefer you not doing it, but he is not implying it would be a problem. So I don\u2019t know what the problem is?", "NTA - I do not like tattoos on anybody and I prefer women with long hair. My wife has short hair and has been thinking about getting a tattoo. I love her regardless of her appearance. If she wants a tattoo I'm not going to try to stop her. I will be honest with her if she asks my opinion, but I don't get a say on what anybody else does with their own body. \n\nI think you are giving up autonomy by trying to compromise with your husband. He doesn't have a say in what you do with your body. Is this a deal breaker for him? He knew you had tattoos before he married you, it's not like it's a surprise you threw out there on your wedding night.", "Info: When you say \"my husband doesn't like it\" has he expressed that to you about your body? Or is that just his general opinion on tattoos? \n\nBecause there is a big difference between voluntarily compromising on your personal autonomy for someone you love and being forced to. \n\nLet me give you an example. \n\nMy ex loved long hair. If I even suggested getting it cut, he would get upset. I never cut my hair until my divorce. Then I kept it shorter for years. What I viewed as compromise was really him controlling my behavior through his reactions. \n\nMy husband of 20+ years,  met me with shorter hair. Never had an opinion other than I'm beautiful. My hair went through many color changes and length changes in the first ten years we were together. He never made a negative comment. We were married 10 years when I asked him what he thought about me growing my hair out again. That was the first time he said \"I love when you have long hair\" my hair has been long ever since. That's voluntary compromise for someone you love. \n\nCan you see the difference? \n\nYou shouldn't feel the need to give something up about your bodily autonomy to keep your spouse happy. It shouldn't cause any personal strife. They are supposed to love you, the entire person. The only way compromise works is when both partners approach it with love. \n\nSo my concern is more about the relationship in general. \n\nYes everyone is entitled to preferences. Yes we do things for or because we love our spouse. However it's important not to lose ourselves to make our spouse happy. Tattoos are typically part of our identity. They are deeply personal for many. \n\nI'm very concerned about any relationship that requires physical changes (tattoo removal) to keep a partner happy. (Of course there are exceptions to this as well, like an exs name might be a reason to have a tat removed or altered but again that should be an independent decision)", "NAH\n\nOn one hand it's your body so your choice.  But equally beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  \n\nHe doesn't have to like your decision however he does seem to respect it and doesn't sound as though he is trying to change your mind at all.  But you are doing this knowing he doesn't like it but want to do it anyway. \n\nI suppose it boils down to what's more important to you.  Your husband's feelings or your desire for a new tattoo.", "NTA, but honestly, do your hair the way you want it, not the way he wants it. And get the tattoos without having to remove others if that's what you want. He can state his preference, but it's your body and unless you're telling him what to do with HIS body (how to wear his hair, etc), he doesn't get to tell you what to do with yours. Also, this is super weird that he likes tattoos on other people and has considered getting one himself, but not on you. Super weird and nonsensical.", "You're changing your appearance to be more attractive to him? Did he not find you attractive before getting married? Did he marry you for you or for your potential to live up to his standards? I'm really confused...", "NTA, and as you said, it's your body. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to get it.

I understand posters saying the husband is allowed his feelings, but he doesn't have to bring them to OP or use them to try to control OP's behavior.\n\nMy partner got a haircut I don't like. They are really feeling it and into it, so I am not shitting on their joy. It really isn't that hard. My attraction to them is deeper than a haircut.\n\nSame with tattoos, they want some tattoos that I don't love. But I love THEM and this is how they want to authentically express themselves. I don't expect them to adhere to an aesthetic for me. Love and attraction are, and should be, more than that.", "How does he know he finds you more attractive without tattoos if you already had them when you met him?\n\nAnyway, NAH.", "Imo, NTA. Saying he won\u2019t like if you get a tattoo is fair, but I feel like if he cared that much he shouldn\u2019t have married someone that already had multiple tattoos unless you explicitly stated you wouldn\u2019t get more. And asking you to grow your hair out isn\u2019t reasonable since your hair length makes more of a difference in your daily life (like how short hair is easier to dry, lighter, requires different styles than long hair, etc).", "INFO: what types of sacrifices and compromises is he making?", "NTA but girl come on\u2026 stand up", "NTA.\nAny man who wants to control your body is the AH. \n\nIf you're  placating  him this way I wonder what else it extends to. You should  not have to feminised yourself  for love.", "It kinda sounds like maybe your husband isn't really into you. You don't have to change everything about yourself for someone to love you. NTA.", "i grew my hair out and didn't get more tattoos for a man once. it was the worst. be fully yourself the way you like to be, and if he doesn't like it, he was never that into you.", "NTA but I don't like the control factor here. Your hair is subject to his tastes, instead of yours? Your ink is his to comment on? \n\nDoes he handle his appearance to your desires too? Or is this one sided?", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why you would change your physical appearance for your partner if you weren\u2019t neutral about it or wanted it as well. (Not getting tattoos until now cause your husband might not be comfortable is\u2026)\n\nAs others mentioned I get your husband not liking them but if my SO wanted something that would make them happy, I would support them cause it\u2019s something that makes them feel good, even if I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it.", "NAH. He has preferences, so do you, he isn't claiming you don't have the right to look how you want. But he also doesn't have to pretend he likes tattoos if he hates them, etc. You aren't going to change his mind, but it's up to you what matters more. I wouldn't get any tats or piercings my wife would hate, personally.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your body.  Do what you want with it.  Nobody else should control what someone does to their own body or how they dress/do their hair.  \n\nBut also, you need to be ok with him possibly not being attracted to what you do with it and deciding he wants out.   Because that is also ok for him to do.", "I try hard to not actively do permanent things that make my wife less attracted to me.", "I\u2019m a bit weirded out that you\u2019ve said:\n\n> but also is kind and doesn\u2019t say anything about the ones that are there. \n\nThat\u2019s not being \u201ckind\u201d or some great action on his part worthy of mention. That\u2019s just the bare minimum, assumed standard of behavior to not be a jerk about somebody else\u2019s body and autonomy, particularly concerning things that occurred before you knew him. \n\nYou\u2019re making all these compromises on your appearance and choices for him while hes compromising **nothing** and literally pouts about it, which btw, **is** a manipulation tactic. Why isn\u2019t he making compromising here? Why is it only you? Are either of you aware that compromises involve **BOTH** parties making concessions\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. So what\u2019s he actually doing? He\u2019s the one with the issue, which ftr, the tattoos isnt the problem, the real issue is his inability to accept that he doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do with *your body*, nor does he get to be \u201csad/upset, dejected and forlorn\u201d about a *conversation* about you getting a tattoo or anything else for that matter. He can state an opinion ***respectfully*** (which he\u2019s not doing) but ultimately it ends there and no matter the outcome he needs to accept your decision without being so damn ridiculous about it.", "NTA and honestly I think it's *deeply weird* that you even considered tattoo removal as part of a \"compromise,\" unless you already wanted those tattoos gone. I would have gone with NAH if your husband had simply said 'okay that's fine, I'm not a huge fan but it's your arm,' but bargaining how much of your skin can be inked or w/e...that's bizarre. You get to keep some of your skin to yourself and he gets the rest?", "NTA to want more tattoos but seems to me your husband has made it clear that he does not find them attractive.  Many things in a marriage are compromises and maybe this is one you will make, or not.  Your feelings are important and his feelings are important.  Seems that he's not making a big fuss about your getting more, but he is definitely letting you know how he feels about your getting more.  \n\nYou too seem considerate of his desires in that you'll let your hair grow out because he likes it that way.  Some would call this controlling, but not me.  You are choosing to grow your hair out, he's not insisting on it.  I've had things in my marriage that I do for my husband and things that I don't because I don't want to.  It's all a matter of what you feel okay about doing when you know your spouse's preferences.  I'm NOT speaking of his controlling you, simply your knowing his preferences and your choosing to accommodate them because you like making him happy.  I think husbands and wives should do this for each other out of love and caring, NOT from being forced.  I don't sense you are forced to do anything here.  \n\nIn the end, the final decision is yours and yours alone.  It IS your body, your choice.", "NTA. Your husband can express his opinion about what he prefers, but ultimately it\u2019s your body, and it\u2019s good for you to feel comfortable and confident about it. IMO If he doesn\u2019t like tattoos, he doesn\u2019t have to get them himself.", "Nah, he just married the wrong girl", "NTA. A happy and healthy long-term relationship requires that both parties are able to have their own bodily autonomy and self-expression. Spouses should strive to support each other in their interests of self-expression, and something as trivial as a haircut or a few tattoos shouldn\u2019t be dictated by them. They can express their opinion, and you can take their opinion into account, but ultimately your decision shouldn\u2019t make or break your marriage. If he needs to take time to process, he should do that on his own time and really get to the bottom of why he feels so strongly about these things, especially if they make you happy! If he needs to talk through it with a therapist, he should. And there\u2019s absolutely no reason why you should have your preexisting tattoos removed for his sake. It\u2019s costly, painful, and not even something you personally want done. You\u2019re being way too accommodative to his whims.", "Compromise is great and very important in relationships. But what I get tattooed on myself and the length/style/color of my hair is not up for debate. And this goes both ways. For example my husband has recently grown a beard. It\u2019s not my favorite look on him, (to put it nicely) but I respect him enough to give him the same respect and leeway for personal choices as he gives me.  And so it\u2019s a non-issue. I don\u2019t think anyone is TA here. But I do think that you should re-evaluate what things about yourself are off limits when it comes to pleasing your guy. A relationship is not about changing the person you are with to be what you want, it\u2019s about loving the person you are with and accepting them for who they already are.", "NTA\nNO ONE gets to tell you what to do with your own body. Removing tattoos as a compromise?!? NO! Only if YOU want that done. He gets absolutely ZERO to say about it, or he can GTFO.", "NTA Your body not his.

Seems like a bad idea.", "NTA but...\n\nIn some of your responses I find issues I'd like to sum up, to my understanding.\n1.) Your husband has told you about his physical preferences for you, and you have none for him in return.\n2.) He makes the majority of the income and handles more of the childcare load.\n3.) You are removing two tattoos currently.\n\nHave you had the conversation about the financial impact that getting and removing tattoos has? Neither of those things is cheap, and maybe it's not just the physical preference he has about tattoos that's making him dislike your idea of getting a new one?\nAlso, you mention your job is high stress - are tattoos how you deal with stress? I had a friend like that, and she chose tattoos over therapy for a very long time.\n\nI don't think you're an AH here, and the only reason I think he may be is the personal preferences thing. But sometimes men choose to talk about things that bother them in the 'least upsetting to their audience ' way (ie maybe financial talk with you is avoided in an effort to not hurt your feelings). I'd advise a proper adult conversation about the placement, design, idea behind, cost, and your want of this new tattoo. Then also his objections to or input on all of that. Maybe you all can come to a better understanding of each other's view points, if nothing else. \n\nGood luck, you both at least appear to be trying to be in a functional relationship!", "NAH.

It is not legitimate to sulk and try and prevent them from cutting their hair by guilting them about it, and it is not legitimate to act up if they choose to go ahead with it. Ultimately, you should love the person, not just their physical body, so even if they make a choice that is less attractive to you, that doesn't mean you'll suddenly be repulsed by them (if so you never loved them in the first place).\n\nYou're NTA, but you have several choices to make. You can dig into why he's sulking so much, whether he really hates tattoos to this extent or if he's trying to manipulate you. You can get the tattoo and see where his behaviour goes. You can not get the tattoo, and hope that making a choice about your body for someone else instead of yourself doesn't weigh on you.

So you decide what you care about. \n\nAnd I guess he might have his feelings a bit hurt if he thinks you don\u2019t care about his attraction towards you.

I know he's not enthusiastic about my personal expression but he's never sullen or distant about it. Because he loves who I am and wants me to be happy with myself. \n\nI don't know if your partner is TA here but there are some pink flags like treating you differently when he doesn't like your appearance.

Great partner, provider, and dad. Stuff you don't see often around here.

If he was lying to placate her that would be a bad sign of how he feels she treats him when they disagree on something, would it not?", "I'll let my wife know that some random Redditor thinks she's a bad spouse for wanting to be thinner than I tend to prefer. I'm sure it'll change her mind about the tummy tuck.\n\nGood luck out there.", "This is such a gross comment", "Redditors also like to derail a conversation with irrelevant pedantry, probably because nobody in their real life will let them get away with it regularly \ud83d\ude06", "In the context of competitive sports (like football/soccer, as well) a yellow card or yellow flag system makes perfect sense. The reason being that there are regulated standards and specific, enumerated, rules enforced by objective (in theory) third parties.\n\nI'd be concerned about applying such a concept to interpersonal relationships. The immediate example that springs to mind is situations involving reactive abuse. Even the most passive, forgiving among us has a breaking point...and none among us would want to be judged by the worst of ourselves.", "He\u2019s gone beyond just sharing his opinions, and that indicates he wants to change her mind.", "You get to feel however you want. You don\u2019t get to make your feelings someone else\u2019s problem. Especially about something that doesn\u2019t really affect you.", "Well he would certainly be a hypocrite if he bitched about her tattoos and then gets that. What\u2019s your point?", "She knows where he stands because he\u2019s told her repeatedly. She\u2019s real clear about how he feels, and has tempered her behavior because of that. Is the \u201ccompromise\u201d that she never gets a new tattoo? Because she says his response has been the same when she\u2019s wanted to get one up to and including now.", ">It isn't manipulation to show emotion while discussing things.\n\nIt is if the emotion is out of proportion to the things being discussed. Sad? Really, he got the sads about his wife possibly getting another tattoo? She already has tattoos.", "That's definitely true, and you're definitely correct about reddit... if she cried because she didn't understand why he was being so extra about her skin and hair, people would also jump to her being manipulative.", "Yeah and that's fucked up, dude.", "You must be a blast at parties.", "Getting a tattoo is a personal decision. You don't go out of your way you just go your way. \n\nAnd he's trying to condition what she does with her body, and already got her to remove two of them. \n\nSo his \"opinions\" do in fact have an impact on her. \n\nHe wants her to go out of _her_ way to avoid doing what she likes and finds fulfilling.", "Weight is an entirely different beast because it\u2019s a health issue.", "\u201cPutting your spouse\u2019s needs and desires ahead of your own is gross.\u201d\n\nGood luck ever having a healthy relationship with that attitude.", "I suppose if my earlier point wasn't expressed clearly enough, I'll put it this way: all parties in a relationship should feel safe expressing themselves openly and sincerely. The issue comes when Person B displays a consistent pattern of expecting their partner to regulate Person B's emotion's *for* them through some act of self-sacrifice. (Not getting a desired tattoo, for instance)", "I think you're just thinking too much into it. If someone says something is a red flag for them then it means it's a hard boundary. If they say it's a yellow flag that means it's cause for concern but not necessarily a hard no. Your personal feelings on how the phrasing would make more sense to you if it were different is completely irrelevant to the reality of how the terms are used.", "I mean yeah? He doesn\u2019t like the idea of another tat, he\u2019s trying to get her to change her mind by expressing his feelings. That\u2019s not manipulation. If anything, it\u2019s emotional transparency. Manipulation would be giving a hard ultimatum or punishing her in some way for even considering it, like insulting her for wanting one or making snide comments, things OP has said he does not do. Being sad about something isn\u2019t punishment, it\u2019s allowing yourself to acknowledge and express that feeling. Again, he\u2019s said that ultimately he won\u2019t take any direct action to stop her, like threatening divorce. THAT would be manipulation. \n\nI really hate the completely black and white stance people take towards disagreement in relationships, it\u2019s a hallmark of an emotionally immature person.", "OP asked him tho? He *wasn't* expressing his feelings about it *until* she literally asked for his input. Are you supposed to suppress your emotional response *even when it is asked for?* Fucking yikes.", "OP asked their husband about this, it was and has been a dialogue. Are you now saying people should lie to their partners? \n\nSome of ya\u2019ll are really way out there on a limb to try and call this guy an AH.", "Once again, just because he is sad about it doesn't make it manipulation. Yes, he doesn't want her to. She wants to. They may just not be compatible.\n\nShe has to decide what she wants more just like he will if she gets it. Honestly, I don't think the two of them should've been dating but he probably doesn't dislike them as much as me.", "We don't know the BF, we don't know the tattoo, we don't know the others, and we don't know what he finds acceptable. \n\nWe know they have discussed it, it will make OP happy, it will make his wife less attractive to him, and he is sad about the thought but not enough to try and convince her to stop past his general stance.\n\nSure, it could be manipulation or it could be honest discussion. OP even says they are struggling with balancing the sacrifices they have made as an individual for the couple and wether or not the get the tattoo.\n\nThis doesn't sound like manipulation to me as much as healthy communication and OP wanting more neutral opinions(her friends are going to side with her, his with him). \n\nEdit: having missed the part about removing tattoos. I dunno, that part makes me double take. I still stand by what I've said but I can understand why people are jumping to manipulation.", "What is? A person taking their spouse's feelings into consideration before making a decision? Oh the horror", "You must be a blast in relationships. As in you blow them up.", "She chose to get them removed. She said he never asked her to, that she chose to. Is it only bodily autonomy to choose to get a tattoo and never if you choose to remove one? Is bodily autonomy not at play when one chooses, of their own accord, to do something because it'll make their partner happy?\n\nOf course his opinions have an impact on her, and vice-versa, they're married. When you're married you can still choose to do whatever the hell you want, but often choose to/not to do something because of how it could affect your partner and your relationship with them. My wife isn't violating my bodily autonomy because she'd be upset if I fucked someone else and thus I choose not to. She also wouldn't be violating my autonomy if she had an opinion on me getting a tattoo or changing my hairstyle. She's even allowed to offer those opinions unsolicited, because she's my wife, but this guy isn't even doing that, only answering truthfully when asked.", "Oh, you're one of those. How am I not surprised lmao.\n\nMy tattoos are a health issue, too, in that case. They keep me from sh and suicide attempts. People finding ways to feel comfortable in their own bodies is incredibly important. \n\nTreating an aesthetic preference as more important than someone's comfort in themselves is missing a way bigger picture.", "My husband and I are very happy. I'm not sure he'd be happy if I told him how I prefer him to look or pouted when he did something I didn't like. He doesn't like his facial hair as long as I do. He doesn't like his hair as long as I do. But my attraction towards him hasn't changed. \n\nIt's shallow for a spouse's attraction to be conditional. Yeah, people like what they like, but if her getting a tattoo is so upsetting he's going to mope around the house for a few days, then that's shallow and childish. Being married does not mean only doing things your spouse likes."]}
