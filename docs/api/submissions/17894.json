She didn't have a clue how to pay the bills or what their budget had looked like. My father did all of that for her. We had NO problem helping her with whatever she needed. We have been extremely involved and willing to help her with these huge life changes. \n\nEarly on she asked if she could potentially live with us temporarily if she found herself in a situation where her house sells and she hasn't yet found an apartment. Our answer was along the lines of: \"Well of course, we wouldn't leave you on the streets. But our house is cramped so the longest we can help is a few weeks to a month.

But that's me. Objectively you're not an a.h but subjectively your desicion would make you not my cup of tea as a friend or a relationship partner. Then again idk your relationship with your mom.", "I might be cut from a different cloth, but I would take my parents in on a heartbeat. I have 3 sisters, and we all agreed long ago that when our elderly parents can no longer live on their own for whatever reason they can come live with any one of us for the rest of their lives. We would make them comfortable, and will continue to enjoy the close relationship and bonding that they have with the grandkids. SMH cause YTA!!!", "NTA. You\u2019re not leaving her to her own devices, just holding boundaries.", "Yes.  Sometimes it's not about the number of bedrooms or size of living space.  My mother is my best friend, but I could not live with her.  I have a good sized house, but I need personal space and the ability to live with my own family without my mother around.", "[deleted]", "That's lovely that you have such a positive relationship with your parents and that you are in a position to respond to the demands of caring for elderly people. Not everyone has this relationship and even the most patient and compassionate people can be pushed to the brink from carer exhaustion. You've been judgemental of the OP here, which is unkind, considering the manipulation tactics her mum is using against her.", "I wonder if you have a family/ spouse and kids of your own. As I would wonder how they feel with all of this. That if you choose your extended family (parents/siblings) than your own spouse and kids\u2019 needs wants", "There\u2019s \u201ccan make it work in a pinch\u201d and \u201clive comfortably\u201d. I have 4 bedrooms and 3 kids, and letting the kids share a room ends in bed time drama and early wake ups. Even with babies, there can absolutely be reasons why giving them their own room can be preferable. Working from home and the need for workspace at home is common these days - and with young kids, that needs to be a separate space realistically. I\u2019d really let the OP be the judge here of what they do or do not have space for.", "Just like my parents took care of me in my young age I too will take care of them in their old age. Makes no difference to me if I am in the position to take in my parents or not, they will always be welcomed to live in my home. I\u2019m sure when my sisters & I were young they suffered, struggled & sacrificed for us, but that\u2019s what family does, we look out for each other and we take care of each other. My parents would never be a burden on me or my sisters, nor would we make them feel like they are a burden. I simply gave my thoughts & opinion, regardless if you agree or not.", "[removed]", "I love how everyone either assumes OP to be American or has an American sensibility of space, it\u2019s hilarious to think that bed time drama is a reason for kids not to share a room, keep these takes to yourself lol. 2 kids under 5 sharing a room isn\u2019t exactly the dilemma everyone is making it out to be, plus the youngest must still be in a crib, very easy to shift a crib into the parents room if it\u2019s that big of an issue", "It's lovely that you had parents who took care of you. If they had abused you, would you still take them in to your home and care for them? My point is that you have judged OP as though she had the same nurturing experience as you did. I doubt that's the case based on how her mum is behaving. \nEven if OP's mum was a self-sacrificing angel, the reality of having an elderly parent living in your home changes all kinds of dynamics, and isn't a decision to be undertaken lightly, or just because \"that's what families do\". That's an ideal from a past era. There's a lot of dysfunction out there, and most people aren't living in an episode The Waltons.", "Little kids grow up (hopefully). They won\u2019t want to be sharing a room in 10 years time. If the OP doesn\u2019t move or renovate in that time, there will be no room for them all. They cannot comfortably live in that house for the next 20 years if mom comes to live with them.", "Sure but they haven\u2019t grown up right now. My only point here is that this is not a space issue, it\u2019s a willingness issue. OP does not want her mother to stay with her for whatever reasons but it\u2019s convenient for her to pick space since that excuses her from any moral accountability. Her father died in Jan, her mother probably lost a life partner of several decades 5 months ago, she\u2019s clearly distraught and probably not in the right headspace. OP has chosen to highlight her contribution of decluttering her house and holding her hand trying to figure out if she could AFFORD TO RETIRE?The woman is 67 years old. All OP seems to be interested in is fast tracking the process of how her mother is no longer her problem.", "NTA She unfriended you on facebook though, I don't know how you come back from that.", "NTA but remember grief makes people act kind of crazy. How long were your parents together? She\u2019s probably panicking at so many big changes - death, retirement, moving home. Your dad paid all the bills and organised their life, now he\u2019s gone, that safety is gone too. All that at once is enough to make anyone irrational.  You\u2019re her daughter, she feels safest with you, so she\u2019s dragging her heels. \n\nAgain, NTA, but I doubt anyone else would be acting more reasonably than your mother is right now, if they were in her shoes", "NTA\n\nYour mom hasn't lived on her own in a long time, if ever, and she has no intention to start now. It's why she's trying to manipulate you into letting her move in. Do not give in. If she moves in, you'll never get her out.", "NTA\n\nYour mother never had any intention of finsing herself a place. She was waiting until she called your bluff and that backfired.\n\nShe fully expects and assumes that you will let her move in permanently. Stand your ground. Your live will never be the same.", "NTA she definitely just wants to stay with you. I understand she\u2019s heartbroken, but she lives so close! And you all are being so supportive! Great job keeping firm boundaries, don\u2019t waver.", "NTA\n\nTime to let Momma ride the couch, though.", "NTA\n\nLooks like she needs therapy to help her handle this change in her life. She\u2019s gone from being super dependent to being forced into independence.", "NTA\n\nHold the line. Insist on seeing a rental agreement before you let her move in. I feel for her, but this is excessively dependent and manipulative  on her part.", "[deleted]", "NTA but from reading this it makes it sound like your mum is lonely. She just lost her husband. By no means do you have the space in your house but maybe a little compassion for her?", "Yes!! You are the Asshole! I hope your kids treat you the same exact way!!!", "NTA. Yeesh your mom is manipulative. She'd be dangerous if she was actually any good at it.", "NTA from my cultural perspective. \n\nIn my culture, it is very rare that elderly parents live with their adult children. They downsize to a smaller place, maybe closer to their children so they can see each other often but still have their own space and independence. When they get too weak to live on their own, they get daily visits from caregivers, and whean that is no longer enough they move to a care home. \n\nSo for me, it would be a hard no for my mother to move in. She would not even ask it. Everyone would be so surprised if she even asked.\n\nMaybe OP has other cultural background. But the verdict is a NTA from me.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t want an apartment she wants to move in with you so you can take care of her.\n\nYou need to hold your ground. Do not let her guilt manipulate you in any way. She wants you to support and take care of her for the rest of her life.", "NTA. She\u2019s taking the piss and she knows it. If you gave into this you would never be rid of her", "Your mother has exactly zero intention of living on her own. Moving in with you has been her plan from go. NTA.", "NTA but I'm going to suggest that your mother is still grieving and she probably doesn't want to tell you that she's scared to live alone. Honestly, she's probably really f-ing terrified. You've done everything you can to help your mother with the practical stuff, but what she probably needs right now is some therapy.\n\nI'd try approaching things again with maybe a more compassionate tone. Does that mean letting her live with you for more than the stated time? HECK NO. That's not feasible for you. Is she being manipulative? Absolutely. But I think it's because she's afraid.... probably terrified of what her life now looks like without your dad.", "Yes, help even with her limited means ....", "[deleted]", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", ">By no means do you have the space in your house but maybe a little compassion for her?\n\nFor the next 20 years? She is never going to move out.", "What do you call all the support her daughter has given her till now?", "You mean help her within their possibilities?", "Maybe OPs mom needs more guiding than OP is willing to take on. There\u2019s also the consideration of the moms stuff. Maybe OP and her husband cannot afford to help out with storage of the mom\u2019s belongings while she waits for this new build apartment. Maybe OPs kids have special needs and need the space. There is a lot left out. Even if she is from a different culture than American (and I do agree that we tend to read things in a way that suits our cultural beliefs and cut people off/out of our lives for trivial things), there are many background details that could help people decide. I agree that this sounds like more of a lack of desire to help the OPs mom rather than a lack of space\u2026 unless this is a very tiny house.", "NSH. I don',t know your mother, but I worked with elder people. You're right, you tried to help your mom and it don't work. But she just lost her partner and her house. It's traumatic. Maybe she isn't a manipulative, she's lost. Keep giving her support after she move away to a new home even if she's angry. You apparently are a good daughter, I hope that time heal your loss for your father and helps your relationship with your mother", "NTA, ohhhh no thats all kind of red flags. I dont get why people think proving they would be inconsiderate is going to change anyone's mind that they would be inconsiderate... as if you'd want to live with her retaliation? Shes showing you that your support isn't appreciated and that she would exploit the opportunity if you let her cross your boundary. You are being a good parent, she is not.", "NTA if you let her move in she will never leave", "NTA. Make her sign a lease. You can add a section that it is for a set time in order to find her own housing. Makes it easier to evict her, because after reading this, I bet that is what will happen.\n\nEdit: also make sure she has to pay an amount, even a symbolic amount of 1 dollar would suffice.", "Your mom has to learn basic independence now that your father passed away. She is scared and probably doesn't even want to go through the process. I understand her point of view but I also understand yours. So I say NTA.", "How long has it been since your father passed away?\n\nHow many talks have you had with your mother over her grief?\n\nNTA for the living situation. Your mom didn't need to sell the house faster than necessary. And if your place is too small, it's too small.\n\nBut, I have to wonder if maybe a part of it is...she's lonely? Not only losing her husband of however many years, if it was in part due to old age then she also is gonna be thinking about how it's probably almost her time as well.\n\nAnd I can tell you from experience (medical reasons on my end), having to face that you could die any day...it makes life incredibly lonely. Even if you have some ppl around, it's not quite the same as family.\n\nI can't say for sure, but I wonder if the reason she's being difficult is because she wants to stay around her family. Again, not saying you have to house her, but some understanding may help?", "NTA. She had no plans to move on. You did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nI understand and can empathize with your mother. She's had someone doing all the \"serious\" stuff like bills and financial guidance for her her whole life. Most women have a deep need to be secure. Through their own actions or those of their mates. Financial security affects most things in the material life, so it's a leading cause of fear. \n\nOut of your mother's fear, she is trying to manipulate you and the situation. Force it to a given bandage shape that will heal the injury left by the loss of her husband. \n\nWhile having great empathy for her, and expressing love to the best of your ability, you can help her navigate this through financial classes. Whether those be taught by you or some organization. You are already willing to do quite a bit to assist her and I applaud you for that. \n\nLike the drowning person who will slap away a flotation device, then put the rescue swimmer in a bear hug, unwittingly trying to drown you both, you'll need to create a healthy distance between you to help her. This distance shouldn't come from a place of frustration, anger, or fear on your part, but because you love yourselves enough to help but not enable. \n\nWhatever that looks like for you, I wish you patience and empathy in this experience. Remember, mom may not understand that what you're willing and able to do is you showing love. As long as you remain loving of yourself, your home and her, things will work just fine for you and it will work out however your mother decides it will for herself.", "NTA and it\u2019s awesome you\u2019ve set boundaries, sometimes that can be hard when it comes to family.", "NTA. She has zero intention of ever leaving if she moves in. She would rather live in her car than in a temporary apartment while waiting for the one she actually wants is finished, and I bet something would have gone wrong and she wouldn't be able to get in when that time came.", "NTA I\u2019d never allow this either. You have a life to live with your husband and family. Your mom had her time with her family and raising her kids, not it is your turn to do that. You are not obligated to take her in at all. One month is very generous. \n\nShe\u2019s manipulating you by threatening to live in her car. Just go along with it and tell her things like \u201cokay well if that is a suitable living arrangement for you than that\u2019s fine\u201d or be like \u201cwell I don\u2019t support that but that doesn\u2019t mean you are moving in with us\u201d \n\nWhen she asks who doesn\u2019t want her there, just say something like \u201cWE are not taking anyone in because that is not what is best for our family.\u201d Stay united in this one. I\u2019m so sorry that you lost your dad. I hope you have had a chance to grieve without your mom acting this way. But your mom is not your burden to bear like this.", "NTA, it seems you've shown compassion while clearly communicating your boundaries from the start. You've done nothing reproachable in my opinion.   \nI don't know if your mother has a habit of victimizing herself / expecting others to solve her issues, or if this is a direct symptom of her grief, but it sounds like she needs help with changing her mindset. Perhaps she can benefit from grief counseling / therapy?", "NTA\n\nGood for you for setting the boundaries. I don't think your mom is trying to be difficult tho. I think she's scared to be alone and on her own for the first time in over 30 years.\n\nYour plan for the future and boundaries are absolutely valid. I would suggest sending mom to a grief counseling or support group for widows and widowers. \n\nOn the other hand have you considered selling your appartment and buying a new bigger one jointly with mom? (Ofc that is not for everyone - I love my mom, but for 5 generations of my family, no daughter was able to live conflict free with her mother. Not to mention OPs siblings and issues of inheritance)", "You can always help her make a choice faster by showing her retirement homes\u2026 \n\nI know it\u2019s kind of mean, (as she is only 67yo) but you can build is on community of people with things in common.", "Okay, so, NTA. \n\nHowever, it is also worthwhile taking a step back. Has your mother *ever* lived on her own? Considering her age, it's not farfetched to think that she went straight from her parents' house to the marital house, and then her husband seems to have handled most of the slings and arrows of daily life since then. Now she's 67, and everything has been upended. \n\nWhat is your relationship with your mother like outside of this? This particular interaction does not sound super-positive, but it's also a fraught situation. You have two very young children. It is possible that there would be some benefits to having grandma around in this situation. Free childcare, for one. \n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean she has to live in the house with you. You do say you have a house, which implies property... what are the zoning laws like in your area? I know that you say she doesn't have much to retire on, but is there enough to build a one-room tiny house on the property, or get an RV? Would this be permissible in your area? You could become her landlord. You can buy tiny house kits for pretty cheap. She'd have a place to sleep, a kitchen, a little living space, and could come visit. \n\nIf she's toxic/clingy generally and you just can't imagine the idea of having her that close, then that's also totally fair, and don't even suggest it. But it also sounds like this is a very charged situation, and there are potential alternative solutions that do not involve her living in the same building as you. Even if she's not great with paying bills or managing that side of life, I do imagine she knows how to cook, maintain a living space, and deal with children. You could potentially work something out.", "NTA\n\nYou told her up front she needed to have a plan. She is purposely trying to seem like she has a plan so she can stay with you. With that, your mom sounds a bit scared and lonely. You don\u2019t mention her friends other than asking them for lounging, her siblings or family, her husband\u2019s siblings or family, or her other children. It doesn\u2019t sound like she has anyone to support through her grieving at the level she needs. It also sounds like she did nothing in way of being a functional adult when she got married. Her husband took care of it all. She might be dealing with grief and the reality that she has to act on her own behalf now. You don\u2019t have to house her to support her, but I\u2019d suggest making sure she gets into therapy that assists with grief and life skills. Also, I agree with you in this moment. But please don\u2019t tell her she can\u2019t stay with you during this but ask her to babysit.

Also just the idea of living alone could be seriously daunting and terrifying after living with a partner for so long, especially one who took care of everything.

But from where I'm from, the kid of relationship OP is mentioning isn't enough to tell her to leave in 2-3 weeks. \n\nAgain, it's just different culture. In our culture everyone helps everyone and it's more about community then individualistic thing. Both ways have their pros and cons but yeah.", "Culturally, you Americans and your personal space look at things differently.  OP has a great relationship with their mother, or they wouldn't tolerate helping her through so much, that's not what's impinging on their mental health if they moved in together. \n\n\nI get it, it's uncomfortable living with a third wheel,  but there are cultures out there where the personal boundaries are smaller and is culturally accepted as so, and in fact celebrated to have a \"boisterous household\", but those cultures also have a lower bullshit threshold - everyone being in everyone else's business keeps the trouble makers somewhat in line", "I guess that could be it. I always find it amazing how sharing a room becomes a big argument here. Like everytime I've seen a post about folks not allowing families to stay with them during need because the children will have to share a room, I've just internally wondered wow. Because growing up  having a personal room was a luxury not exactly a necessity. I think most everyone would let folks stay even if they struggled because the idea has always been that any struggle you get from living with people is less compared to folks not having a home at all. \n\nAnother thing I find strange is how small small things are considered as gaslighting. Like, having expectations from partners and families and trying to convince them turns into an abusive relationship that needs to end. \n\nIdk how folks live like this. We here help our neighbor's, families and friends all the time even if it's inconvenient and the thing is it's almost always reciprocated too. You just don't leave people alone. It's always a community in here to help you if you need it. \n\nI just feel so sad for the mother because she's so old and while OP did help her a lot, it must be so had to deal with all this. Posts like these just makes me feel very lonely.", "> Anyway, NTA. Edit: she also owns a car and is on social media but doesn't know how to pay bills? Really? \n\n\nThat is INCREDIBLY believable.\n\nI worked as the office girl for a 300-apartment complex for about a year.

I really hope that the mom gets the support she needs and learns to live her best life in this new chapter. \n\nI might be biased though because I lost my mom at a young age. I cared for her for over a year as she was dying from cancer when I was only 20. It required a lot of sacrifice, but I\u2019d do it all again.
