My husband and I spent many hours over multiple weekends to help her declutter, dispose, donate, and sort of all of the contents of her large three bedroom house. I might add that their house hadn''t been decluttered 30 years. Her house is about a 40 minute drive from ours. \n\nWe also held her hand through trying to decide if she could afford to retire (not comfortably but maybe if she pinched pennies). She didn't have a clue how to pay the bills or what their budget had looked like. My father did all of that for her. We had NO problem helping her with whatever she needed. We have been extremely involved and willing to help her with these huge life changes. \n\nEarly on she asked if she could potentially live with us temporarily if she found herself in a situation where her house sells and she hasn't yet found an apartment. Our answer was along the lines of: \"Well of course, we wouldn't leave you on the streets. But our house is cramped so the longest we can help is a few weeks to a month. If you require more than that please reach out to a friend.\" \n\nHer response was grateful at first. As some time went on she would ask questions like, \"Why don't you want me to stay with you?\" Or \"Which one of you doesn't want me to stay?\" (referring to my husband and I) Her tone was interrogative. \n\nAround this time we noticed she was not looking for a place besides putting in an application that covered three or four apartment buildings where there is a substantial wait-list for. We begin to tell her that she can still stay with us but ONLY if she's actively looking for a place to live. \n\nNow her house is going to sell and she has to be moved out by May 31 and she doesn't have an apartment. She called us with only 11 days until she has to move out. It happened a bit faster than anticipated but she gave the OK for the increased timeline. She told us the apartment she wants is a new building that hasn't opened yet and she is on the wait-list for. She \"thinks\" it will be available in one month. There is no absolute date for it opening. She is making a ton of excuses why she won't look for another place, such as: this is the only place she feels safe and she needs a washer/dryer in- unit and a garage for her car in the winter. \n\nWe told her she cannot live with us unless we help her find an apartment to live that is available right now or very soon. She said she would rather live in her car with her cat and shower at a gym then find another place to live. After I clearly and calmly set my boundaries her final words to me were, \"Okay fine, I bet your father is smiling down on you.\" And she unfriended me on Facebook.", "created_utc": 1684733966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ohq4v/aita_for_not_letting_my_recently_widdowed_mother/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But that's me. Objectively you're not an a.h but subjectively your desicion would make you not my cup of tea as a friend or a relationship partner. Then again idk your relationship with your mom.", "I might be cut from a different cloth, but I would take my parents in on a heartbeat. I have 3 sisters, and we all agreed long ago that when our elderly parents can no longer live on their own for whatever reason they can come live with any one of us for the rest of their lives. We would make them comfortable, and will continue to enjoy the close relationship and bonding that they have with the grandkids. SMH cause YTA!!!", "NTA. You\u2019re not leaving her to her own devices, just holding boundaries.", "Yes.  Sometimes it's not about the number of bedrooms or size of living space.  My mother is my best friend, but I could not live with her.  I have a good sized house, but I need personal space and the ability to live with my own family without my mother around.", "It\u2019s her decision but with a 3 bedroom house and only 2 small kids, they do have room to house her lol", "That's lovely that you have such a positive relationship with your parents and that you are in a position to respond to the demands of caring for elderly people. Not everyone has this relationship and even the most patient and compassionate people can be pushed to the brink from carer exhaustion. You've been judgemental of the OP here, which is unkind, considering the manipulation tactics her mum is using against her.", "I wonder if you have a family/ spouse and kids of your own. As I would wonder how they feel with all of this. That if you choose your extended family (parents/siblings) than your own spouse and kids\u2019 needs wants", "There\u2019s \u201ccan make it work in a pinch\u201d and \u201clive comfortably\u201d. I have 4 bedrooms and 3 kids, and letting the kids share a room ends in bed time drama and early wake ups. Even with babies, there can absolutely be reasons why giving them their own room can be preferable. Working from home and the need for workspace at home is common these days - and with young kids, that needs to be a separate space realistically. I\u2019d really let the OP be the judge here of what they do or do not have space for.", "Just like my parents took care of me in my young age I too will take care of them in their old age. Makes no difference to me if I am in the position to take in my parents or not, they will always be welcomed to live in my home. I\u2019m sure when my sisters & I were young they suffered, struggled & sacrificed for us, but that\u2019s what family does, we look out for each other and we take care of each other. My parents would never be a burden on me or my sisters, nor would we make them feel like they are a burden. I simply gave my thoughts & opinion, regardless if you agree or not.", "Again my thought and opinions, you don\u2019t have to agree, or like it, frankly I don\u2019t care if you do or not. Go work on your parent issues with someone else\u2026like maybe a therapist.", "I love how everyone either assumes OP to be American or has an American sensibility of space, it\u2019s hilarious to think that bed time drama is a reason for kids not to share a room, keep these takes to yourself lol. 2 kids under 5 sharing a room isn\u2019t exactly the dilemma everyone is making it out to be, plus the youngest must still be in a crib, very easy to shift a crib into the parents room if it\u2019s that big of an issue", "It's lovely that you had parents who took care of you. If they had abused you, would you still take them in to your home and care for them? My point is that you have judged OP as though she had the same nurturing experience as you did. I doubt that's the case based on how her mum is behaving. \nEven if OP's mum was a self-sacrificing angel, the reality of having an elderly parent living in your home changes all kinds of dynamics, and isn't a decision to be undertaken lightly, or just because \"that's what families do\". That's an ideal from a past era. There's a lot of dysfunction out there, and most people aren't living in an episode The Waltons.", "Little kids grow up (hopefully). They won\u2019t want to be sharing a room in 10 years time. If the OP doesn\u2019t move or renovate in that time, there will be no room for them all. They cannot comfortably live in that house for the next 20 years if mom comes to live with them.", "Sure but they haven\u2019t grown up right now. My only point here is that this is not a space issue, it\u2019s a willingness issue. OP does not want her mother to stay with her for whatever reasons but it\u2019s convenient for her to pick space since that excuses her from any moral accountability. Her father died in Jan, her mother probably lost a life partner of several decades 5 months ago, she\u2019s clearly distraught and probably not in the right headspace. OP has chosen to highlight her contribution of decluttering her house and holding her hand trying to figure out if she could AFFORD TO RETIRE?The woman is 67 years old. All OP seems to be interested in is fast tracking the process of how her mother is no longer her problem."]}
