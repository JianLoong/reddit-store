The topic had come up about how one of my previous managers had been creepy and would touch some of us women at work. I mentioned how the manager had sent me into a panic attack the one day after coming up from behind me, slinked around, grabbed my microphone (that sits between my boobs, attached to my shirt), and proceeded to talk directly into my chest like an inch away. \n    Male friend who I will refer to as M, immediately asked why I had my mic there in the first place (That\u2019s where they attach for all employees). That doing things like that is okay at work since he was the manager and I had no right to be upset and I should\u2019ve expected it. I was shocked he had the nerve to say that and explained that in no instance is it okay for a manager to touch a worker especially without permission. Female friend (A) agreed it wasn\u2019t okay to do. M kept going and aimed it at me for being upset in the first place. I admit I got heated and said that if he keeps defending men who touch women and saying sexist things no woman will want to be with him. Eventually conversation changed. \n    That leads to today, I saw M and tried to say hello. He didn\u2019t say anything so I figured he didn\u2019t hear me. I went over and he told me to go away and leave him alone. I was confused and didn\u2019t even know what he was upset at. He told me I insulted him. I was confused because he never told me he was upset and last I saw him everything was fine. Later, A told me that after I left the table the other day M said about how mad he was at me for saying what I did. She stuck up for me to him and told him he can\u2019t just say things like that and that I had a right to be mad. \n Now everyone seems pissed at me but no one is upset at M for what he said .

What your manager did was sexual harassment.  I would consider losing M no loss at all.  Hopefully if tries that stuff at work he will get fired and/or a lawsuit against him and the company.

Don\u2019t let him gaslight you. You deserve support and protection, not a friend like M.", "NTA, we have these yearly sexual harassment prevention training and your manager is one of the prime examples in these videos. Definitely report it to HR. If you get revenge for your report, bring it to commission of human rights/ human rights and relations.", "NTA. He is probably just embarrassed he got called out.", "NTA. You are definitely correct. \n\nI'm guessing the attitudes are coming from the fact that you took a high level conversation about appropriateness at work (I know it was a specific anecdote but it was in the context of a larger conversation),  and made it personal, saying that no one would date him. And I'm guessing that really hit an insecurity of his.", "NTA, but why are you friends with this dude?", "Info: Is he a person of the involuntarily celibate variety?", "Not the asshole. You\u2019re wrong though, plenty of women date/marry/fuck sexist assholes.", "NTA\n\nM is not only sexist but an idiot.  Hopefully he will never be a supervisor as he will be a disaster for his employers and a menace.\n\nYou were correct in your statements, he just doesn't like his true personality being outed unflatteringly.  Possible Incel?\n\nI DO hope you report your manager.  He made you uncomfortable and touched you.  Two big No No's.  Report it, document that you report it.  If nothing is done to correct the action, take it up a level.  His manager can be personally liable if he does not correct it (see the Ford case).\n\nYou do NOT have to put up with that behavior.  AS for M.  He is not worth your time if he feels in any way you were wrong and that \"you should have expected it\".  My guess, he victim blames SA victims also.", "NTA. Its not your job to make apologists feel better. I hope he learns his lesson", "NTA ditch this AH as friend he is not worth anything", "NTA eewww why are you friend w him? omg your manager is clearly a f harasser and this man just said 'hes right' it's a f mess omgg", "NTA, no manager has the right do what they did regardless of their sex. M and F are not allowed to touch any of their employees, and what he did was considered sexual harassment. As for your male friend, he's only mad because what you told him rings truth. He's possibly not being lucky in finding someone in his life and somehow hit him hard. If he got mad? GOOD! LET HIM. He needs to understand that if it was his daughter, girlfriend or wife, he would not like that another man would get too close and personal like that with them. You should ask him how he would feel if that ever happened to his future partner or children. If he doesn't think anything wrong, ditch him as a friend, he's toxic even though he already showed you he was toxic to begin with, but give benefit of doubt to try and see if he can see reason first.", "NTA", "I'm not sure about this. I think he was wrong about the issue (perhaps he wasn't emphatic due to not having boobs, or maybe he was ignorant, can't really say without being there). But you've finished the conversation with a personal attack targeting his ability to get laid. Other than being hurtful, don't you think it's demeaning to both sexes? \n\nI don't think people should be hiding their opinions about what's appropriate and what's not in order to get laid (though a lot of people seem to fake opinions in order to do that), rather I think they should openly talk about these things to reach conclusions, and learn from each other. \n\nOn the other hand, I don't think women have sex with men as a favor for not being sexist, in fact many sexist men have both long and short term relationships, and there are even women out there who are sexist against women themselves, going as far as blaming rape victims.\n\nIt seems to me that he hurt your feelings by being inconsiderate, and you wanted to hurt him on purpose in return. I honestly don't think that's helpful to anyone. I haven't seen the entirety of your interaction, so I can't be sure, and you have every right to choose your friends however you see fit. But speaking for myself, I wouldn't respond to a comment I see as ignorant or sexist with a personal, sexist attack.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Duck him for being sexist but honestly what you said is not entirely true.

But the scary thing is that some women might actually want to be with him.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t go out of my way to be around him . Up until this point I had never heard him make a remark like this.

There\u2019s no argument for her being an asshole for commenting on a sexist viewpoint and calling it out. She\u2019s right, no woman would want to sleep with someone like that.", "He\u2019s not someone I go out of my way to be around. He\u2019s just a familiar person that I\u2019m friendly with and has a similar friend group. We talk friendly here and there. Up until now I had never heard him say something like this. \n\nAs for my manager I did report him to another higher up and at the very best he had been scolded. The other managers were understanding to me but overall nothing happened. Luckily a few weeks later the place I worked closed down due to the lease of the building ending and Applebees\u2019 parent company no longer wanted to pay for it. So I no longer work for them or around that guy", "When I read your post it was just screaming \"entitled incel got put in his place!\"", "We don't know if he is actually not getting laid. It might've also angered him, because it's obviously an insult coming from a friend. Commenting or calling out on something isn't the same as insulting someone. And finally, do you really believe that sexist men don't get laid? There many men and women belonging to right wing. \n\nThere are also people who have sex with people of opposing values because either they don't know (people don't walk around with notes stuck on their forehead saying they're sexist), or they care about having sex more at the moment. People of opposing political or social opinions even get married sometimes. Seriously be honest, have you never seen a sexist dad? Have you never heard of a woman saying \"These terrible things wouldn't have happened if she was dressed more appropriately?\" Have you never seen any women having a short or long term relationship with a sexist man? Do you think your assumption that generalizing all women in all situations is realistic?\n\nI've definitely seen many examples of sexist men being with both sexist and not so sexist women. Even in my family. One of my cousins (who was a feminist btw), started hanging out with this guy, texted me fairly often about how he was so sexist and insufferable, and fell in love with him in literally a couple of days. Attraction and feelings (or reactions to them) aren't always prevented by values. Another similar example related to values (but not sexism) I've seen was an incredibly racist Polish girl getting together with an Indian guy after making rude comments about his race and country the whole night.", "Right, up until now, but now that you have why do you still want to associate with him?

I wonder if you are trying to find your way out of these long paragraphs of yours cos you don't seem to have any grasp on the reality of Op's question.", "I don\u2019t want to anymore after all this", "That's not an argument, nor a counter argument. OP asked about people's opinions, and I've responded with mine. I didn't say that she was the AH (not that it matters). I just said I wasn't sure (didn't realize that there was a 'correct' answer to a question about opinions that I had to pick in order not to be held in contempt). I've explained my reasons for that, responded with arguments and questions. Maybe you should respond with something valid focusing on the actual contents of those paragraphs instead of an ad hominem fallacy criticizing my style of writing (which I find unfair). Can you not argue your points like a civilized person, instead of throwing passive aggressive attacks at someone who doesn't seem to automatically agree with you completely? Though it's interesting, because it's related to my point. I think people should be able to debate about things."]}
