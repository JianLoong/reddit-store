You Dad did not make any deals or special arrangements regarding the 'skipped' holiday, which happened because of HIS own plans. He is wrong to assume he gets a make-up holiday, especially when this was never even discussed at the time or in any of the days since then.

When you and your siblings have children and spouses, neither your mum or dad will get every other Xmas unless they agree to spend \u2018their Xmas\u2019 together as a foursome.", "NTA. However, do you live far away from your dad? If not could you go see him around New year's? Or even around the Christmas holiday?", "NTA your dad got thanksgiving this year and it wouldn\u2019t be fair if he also got Christmas, meaning your mom would get no holidays this year. He chose to go off on vacation last year with his girlfriend and gave up his turn for Christmas, that\u2019s his own fault.", "NTA", "See him when you can . This was his choice.", "NTA. Your dad chose girlfriend last Christmas he missed his chance.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHAve those holidayds with friends, or with your partner. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVisit xour parents for dinner the days after christmas. THat will stop the discussions, and you will do that at some point anyway, when you have your own family.", "NTA. Your dad made his choice last year and it wasn\u2019t you. Now he has to live with the consequences.", "NTA", "NTA, you are not holding their trip against them but you are holding them to their actions. If Xmas was so important to him....maybe he should have taken his trip this year (which could have also saved them money by booking things so far out, but that don't matter now) then doing it on the year his kids where supposed to be with him. \n\nI do understand where he is coming from though, but again, this then should have been discussed last year. \"We want to go on a trip for Xmas this year. Would you be ok going to your mom's this year and spending it with me next year?\" Would have made everything simple.\n\nSomeone said it in a comment on another post. Like 99% of the issues brought to AITA could be solved if people would simply communicate with each other. Again though, it's always easier said then done especially when it's an outsider giving their opinion on the issue.\n\nDon't change your plans, they had a whole year + to talk about this, you already made plans. However, maybe there is something you and your siblings can do, like grab lunch together, one day while everyone is there. That way you can still see each other even if it's not a whole specific day. But definitely tell him and gf that it's not your problem they didn't think about this sooner. They have had more than enough time to bring it up and talk about it. Waiting until it was that close to the day in question, was a bit immature. The reaction of gf is incredibly immature. Things need to be communicated in advance, especially if they are assuming something that hasn't been talked about with anyone.", "NTA. Your dad knows the schedule and chose to spend it with his girlfriend instead. That\u2019s on him.", "As some one who has lots of divorced family members, thank you for NOT changing the plan. Its always such a hassle trying to organise and if you have a plan that works, for God's sake please stay with it. Your father made a choice on his own to miss Christmas last year, and if it was so important to him to have you switch, he should have brought it up before making the plan.\n\nTo quote a favourite saying of mine, a lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. Definitely NTA, and he would have been fine if he had just accepted your no. The guilt trip is unbelievable.", "NTA, so your father chose his partner over you, and lashed out at you for not \"making up\" for your brother not seeing him for thanksgiving. Your father is a grown man who should be keeping score and expecting you all to jump at his desires.\n\nIt is especially inappropriate that his girlfriend has now gotten involved to call you up and shame you. Honestly that seems like a big enough issue that I wouldn't go spend holidays with him at all anymore, not only is he acting childish but he is creating a relationship with his partner that says she is allowed to treat you with disrespect. That's not a place to visit", "he is interpreting this in a very child like manner.  Last year your father and his gf decided to skip the family christmas.  I presume all the work involved in preparing the house and meal for guests was more work than either of them wanted to do.\n\nthis year they got thanksgiving?  What's wrong with that?\n\nNTA", "Wtf is dad going to do when these people get SOs and children and have in-laws to visit etc?", "Especially since Dad 100% could have made it a New Year's trip with his girlfriend after seeing his kids for the established Christmas celebration and he made the choice to cancel Christmas plans in favor of the trip anyway.\n\nThe only reason the girlfriend is guilt tripping OP now is probably because she talked him into the trip last year and now she feels guilty that he's moping. Actions have consequences.", "This!", "It sounds less an issue of flexibility than Dad wanting control to rearrange a schedule that he disrupted. \n\nHe didn\u2019t ask, he assumed, and got upset when people were going with the normal plans.  \n\nGood relationships are built on flexibility when there is respect all around. Dad and gf are not showing that.", "NTA.  Your dad knew the schedule when he made his vacation plans.  It was his choice to skip his turn, not yours.", "NTA. Dad sold his Christmas last year to his girlfriend. He ain\u2019t getting mum\u2019s this year. Please ask your dad\u2019s girlfriend to  call you only if there\u2019s an emergency with your dad, not to meddle in his adult children\u2019s plans with your mother. The audacity! Please set a boundary now.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t holding his choice against him. He forfeited last Christmas and made other plans. That doesn\u2019t mean he can co-opt this year\u2019s Christmas.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is the one who chose to give up his Christmas with his children.", "NTA\n\nAre your mom and dad in different cities so it would be difficult to meet your dad for a couple of hours for dessert?  Or on the 26th?\n\nYes, it is your mom's turn this year.  But if possible, I would make the side trip to see my dad.", "You\u2019re an adult. You can choose where to spend your time. It\u2019s as simple as that. You don\u2019t owe either of them anything. It\u2019s really kind of you to try and see them an even amount, but your father who is also an adult, chose to spend last Christmas with his girlfriend which was his choice. This year is a mom Christmas year and you are choosing to stick to that. Its pretty simple", "NTA\n\nYour dad made his choice last year and has to live with the consequences, maybe he'll think more clearly in the future"]}
