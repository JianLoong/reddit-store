We have been married almost 20 years and for the most part I have a good relationship with her.

I specifically asked that this weekend we stay in, order take out, and watch Xmas movies which she loves. She was super excited about it BUT she told us a couple hours ago she has signed us up to go caroling tomorrow night. I had had it and told her she is more than welcome to go but I wouldn\u2019t be attending. She looked at my husband for support and he said he wasn\u2019t interested either. Here are where things went very wrong. She told me since we decided to never have children we don\u2019t understand the importance of the holidays and how her son would have been a wonderful husband if I wasn\u2019t so selfish. Neither of us have ever wanted children! I got so angry I told her that if she couldn\u2019t respect us and our decisions she can get the first flight out tomorrow. She started to cry and went to pack. Then threw a major fit I didn\u2019t immediately ask her to stay.

She's lucky you didn't tell her to stay away until 2025", "Oh damn she crossed a line. You guys not having or wanting children is completely irrelevant. Absolutely NTA", "NTA.  Technically you did not tell her to leave.  You said if she can\u2019t respect you and your decisions she could leave.  Apparently her choice is not to respect you and your decisions because she chose to leave.

You need to have a serious conversation with your husband though \u2014 it\u2019s unacceptable that he is protecting his mother when she is bullying you both in this way.", "NTA. Her remarks were WAY out of line.", "NTA. All she had to do was apologize. Your husband should have your back about this, and in fact he could speak to her and urge her to apologize to your both.", "NTA\n\n1. MIL was a poor guest to decide that you were on vacation for her entire month-long vacation.\n2. She was flat-out rude to sign you up for an activity that ignored your stated plans/need for some downtime.\n3. She was over-the-top rude to argue against your refusal to join her in the caroling.\n4. She used emotional blackmail and blamed you for not giving in and letting her have her way AGAIN, over something not even really important to her.\n5. She opted to leave instead of apologizing for treating her DIL host so outrageously.\n6. To hubby: But, sure, hubby. Let's blame OP for putting up with your mom (and your lack of spine) for 3 weeks and not being willing to continue being insulted and run roughshod over for another week. Way to stand up for your wife!", "NTA. It is one things that she wanted to pack as much as possible during this time together and didn't realise the effect on you, but it is another to throw unwarranted personal attacks.", "NTA\n\n>She told me since we decided to never have children we don\u2019t understand the importance of the holidays and how her son would have been a wonderful husband if I wasn\u2019t so selfish.\n\nThis was a relationship-burning outburst. You responded appropriately. She indicated that she wanted the relationship to stay burned.\n\nIt seems clear that she resents you because the two of you don't have children. She thinks that you ruined your husband's life. \n\nDoesn't your husband see that her visit became untenable after her outburst? The only thing that might have saved it was an abject apology on her part. The blow-up wasn't your doing.", "She was intrusive and rude. Belittling for no reason. It\u2019s not your job to entertain her. Especially when you both work full-time. She was way out of line. You lasted longer than I would\u2019ve. NTA", "NTA. She's overbearing and crossed the line. If she wants to celebrate with kids so much,maybe she should foster some kids in need,Im sure they would love it.", "ESH\u2026.

I get that she wants to have some fun around the holidays, but anyone is going to be tired after a long week of work. One weekend of relaxing is not a lot to ask and if she can't accept that then it's on her. Her comment about children was also uncalled for. I'd ask your husband to help support you and talk to her about the expectations if she is going to stay with you moving forward or in the future. She shouldn't talk to you like that no matter what and shouldn't expect constant attention from her adult son with his own life.", "Nta be your most helpful and pack for her print a list of motels for the night. wish her happy Christmas", "NTA why would you two want a baby when she's already behaving like one ?", "Now me personally, I would have to let my husband decide to kick her out. That isnt your mom.", "Wow, manipulative behaviour does should not get rewards, if she can't deal with your life as you both chose to live it then keep packing, you made a simple request in your own home for crying out loud.", "NAH.", "The irrelevancy points to it being the core of her resentment. \n\nThe carols were the catalyst to the outburst, the lack of kids is the cause.", "Really? There's crossing boundaries and then there's being unnecessarily nasty towards and insulting someone in their own home when they've been so kind to let you stay with them for over a month. They politely told her they weren't interested and MIL flew off the handle. That's not okay and OP's response is not, in any way whatsoever, out of line.\n\nOP didn't put her hands on her MIL, she simply told her that she can take her judgemental ass on home and MIL threw an even bigger fit. MIL could have, at any point, apologized and tried to make things better but it doesn't sound like she did.\n\nMIL and (to a much lesser degree) OP's husband suck, but OP definitely does not.\n\nEdit to clarify: Husband sucks a tad bit because he didn't immediately have wife's back and told her that she should have put up with that abuse until after Christmas instead of doing the right thing and telling his mother that she was way out of line and needs to apologize."]}
