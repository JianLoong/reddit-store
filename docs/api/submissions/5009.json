I get that she wants to have some fun around the holidays, but anyone is going to be tired after a long week of work. One weekend of relaxing is not a lot to ask and if she can't accept that then it's on her. Her comment about children was also uncalled for. I'd ask your husband to help support you and talk to her about the expectations if she is going to stay with you moving forward or in the future. She shouldn't talk to you like that no matter what and shouldn't expect constant attention from her adult son with his own life.", "Nta be your most helpful and pack for her print a list of motels for the night. wish her happy Christmas", "NTA why would you two want a baby when she's already behaving like one ?", "Now me personally, I would have to let my husband decide to kick her out. That isnt your mom.", "Wow, manipulative behaviour does should not get rewards, if she can't deal with your life as you both chose to live it then keep packing, you made a simple request in your own home for crying out loud.", "NAH.", "The irrelevancy points to it being the core of her resentment. \n\nThe carols were the catalyst to the outburst, the lack of kids is the cause.", "Really? There's crossing boundaries and then there's being unnecessarily nasty towards and insulting someone in their own home when they've been so kind to let you stay with them for over a month. They politely told her they weren't interested and MIL flew off the handle. That's not okay and OP's response is not, in any way whatsoever, out of line.\n\nOP didn't put her hands on her MIL, she simply told her that she can take her judgemental ass on home and MIL threw an even bigger fit. MIL could have, at any point, apologized and tried to make things better but it doesn't sound like she did.\n\nMIL and (to a much lesser degree) OP's husband suck, but OP definitely does not.\n\nEdit to clarify: Husband sucks a tad bit because he didn't immediately have wife's back and told her that she should have put up with that abuse until after Christmas instead of doing the right thing and telling his mother that she was way out of line and needs to apologize.", "NTA. Having children especially this generation is not easy. Your MIL shouldn't be making plans like that and trying to force you and your husband to participate. It's not ok.", "When she announced that your selfish desire to be childfree ruined your husband's life, he stood there silently? He didn't jump in with \"hey mom, I didn't want kids,\" and instead he was completely silent? Because first of all, that makes me seriously wonder if he does want kids on some level. And second, it makes me confident that he's never going to do any of the relational work with any mutual friend or family member. He will step back and make it your problem. And if he doesn't like the way you handle the problem, he'll tell you that you did it wrong. But he still won't do any of the work himself. \n\nEntitled MILs are a dime a dozen. You have one and so do the rest of us. You also have an entitled husband, and that's the bigger problem. \n\nYTA for not dragging him into participating in that conversation the second she brought him up. She's his mom and making him explain his reproductive choices to her would have been more appropriate than doing it for him. \n\nThey both sound exhausting.", "NTA- I will never get my head around people thinking someone should dedicate the bulk of their best years to raising kids for them to play with a few hours a week or days a year. I certainly don't get the idea that you should compensate her for not doing that. Lord knows if she's that keen to spend time with kids you must be related to or know at least one person who'd love some free childcare!", "NTA\u2026but your husband should be dealing with his mom, not you.

YUCK.", "NTA, boundaries are good. She had a chance to recognize her wrong, apologize and attempt amends but she chose to pack.

She was trying to force options on you guys and when you revolted, she resorted to insults.", "NTA. Visitors and fish both stink after 3 days", "NTA \n\nYour husband should have defended you when his mom made that jab about your selfishness. He is failing you on this.", "NTA - So I am looking for where your husband stood up like a HUSBAND and told her to stop wrongly accusing you of something that was a joint decision. I... am not seeing that.\n\nYour MIL is a pain in the but, but you have an SO prob lem. he isn't defending you, he is enabling her nonsense, and you are left alone to act like an adult while he enables this all.\n\nHe needs to strap on his boots and explain to his mother what she did was wrong, from the accusations that are B.S. to signing you up for events without asking.\n\nOtherwise, HE can go with her and do what she wants. She wants holidays to be about kids? Well, he is behaving like one and she is bossing him like one so... there ya go, they can BOTH go off alone for the holidays until one of them grows a pair and stops enabling the others.", "NTA, but why didn't your husband stick up for you and the decisions you made together?", "NTA. To quote Benjamin Franklin \" Guests, like fish begin to smell after three days. \"\n\nYour MiL stayed far too long, on top of which she sounds exhausting.

MiL can kick rocks.", "NTA  Since you allowed her to run you ragged and make the decisions, she felt that it was okay.  It was time to put your foot down.  Make sure you put a limit on future visits.  Three days max.", "NTA. Set that boundary. I wish my spouse would set a boundary with her parents", "It IS her house though", "NTA, she directly insulted you after being confronted with taking advantage of y'all's time and demanding y'all jump through incredible hoops to keep her happy.\n\nNo it wasn't something to let go until after christmas, she said her son would have been a \"wonderful husband if you weren't so selfish\". She may have done the loop around Cape Horn but she was calling you a bitch. Ask your husband, is he okay with his mother insulting you?

She accused you of being a bad influence, yes, but it sounds like she was just lashing out about her idea to go carolling being (understandably) turned down. She wishes she had grandchildren and hasn\u2019t accepted that her son doesn\u2019t WANT grandchildren. But you absolutely should not have let her get your back up like that. You fucked up big time by getting angry at her outburst. You should have sucked it up through the holidays. \n\nShe should realize she\u2019s being imposing and maybe with a little gentle guidance she would have. But instead you blew up at her and threw her out of the house?? I hope you\u2019ve since apologized.\n\nAnd now that she\u2019s spoken of it, your HUSBAND needs to set her straight that he doesn\u2019t nor did he ever or would ever want kids. He shouldn\u2019t let her think that\u2019s on you!!", "She didn't just schedule plans without asking.  She canceled plans that were made and tried to force something else.", "Exactly this.

She insulted you straight to your face and he is saying you should have let that go? You really need to dig into this, how much bullshit is he expecting you to take from his mother?", "Indeed, you absolutely should be having a confrontation with your husband about letting his mother mistreat you, and ask him where the line is. She directly insulted you and went after you for choosing not to have children, is he okay with that?", "It becomes slightly less irrelevant when you understand that this was a passive aggressive way of punishing them for not giving her grandbabies. Narcissistic behavior with weirdly illlogical justification. \n\n\"I don't understand why they don't want babies... they must not understand the magic of the Christmas season! If I just shove tinsel down their throats, they'll come around to my way of seeing things!!\"", "Indeed, basically she saying that you are a villain and that she doesn't want her son married to you.

Gosh yeah, how could anyone take *that* personally?? \ud83d\ude44 And anyway, you don't have anything to let go of. You could have said \"get out\" and I'd still argue that was justified, but no! You actually still gave her an opportunity to back the fuck off by providing her the choice to a) stay, but act respectful, or b) go. **She chose \"go\".** Sounds like she's the one who can't let go of her disrespect of you as anything but an on-command babymaking machine/entertainment center.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your husband should have immediately jumped in to put her in her place!", "NTA. \n\nShe took the very lowest road in what should have been a slight disagreement.

Instead, she went ahead and insulted you and your marriage of 20 years, and expected that to....encourage you to go caroling?\n\nYour husband should have fully handled it himself, and them maybe she could have stayed until after Christmas.
