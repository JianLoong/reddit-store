Save some other poor saps.", "NTA. \n\nWhy do it surreptitiously?", "Absolutely. Also if you're in the U.K. there is a law about how much notice they have to give you about viewings. \nI had a landlord like this, he told us the estate agent would do the viewings, but  told the estate agent we would so he didn't have to pay them for it. My roommates caved and showed people around but after the 10th viewing I broke and just made them stand in the front garden calling them estate agent. When the estate agent came I kept correcting her, 'no that actually belongs to us and isn't included' for all the electronics- tv, dryer, microwave ect. \nIt took him forever to rent it, and I found out that he actually got in trouble with the council for not having the house to proper standards and the house got condemned. \nWe were students at the time and didn't know any better, but moved across the street to a much nicer place for cheaper rent!", "Do your fellow renters a solid and warn them (subtly if you need to). \n\nDon't let someone else get suckered into moving into the sh\\*thole. \n\nAnd for sure, you can hit the landlord up with a list of issues. But it might be safer to go through whatever the process is where you live for reporting/filing a complaint about a landlord not keeping to the contract and not keepinng a place habitable. \n\nLandlord can just ignore your list (again) and could get mean about it. Whereas if you go the formal complaint route you have a record of the problems and (hopefully depending on your tenancy laws) some protections. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut forget discretion.

Your landlord doesn\u2019t want to take care of the property and putting your health at risk ( black mold ) then I\u2019d absolutely say it in front of them.", "NTA but yes be upfront about it!\n\nWe were doing some house viewings over the summer and saw a beautiful one in the area, the viewing was arranged but without the landlord or the agent. The flat was being rented so the guy showed us around - and told us every single thing that was wrong with it! And boy was it a long list\u2026 which he had complained about constantly and fruitlessly. He even wanted us to tell the agent about the whole story, which we happily did because the place was super overpriced. And it still hasn\u2019t sold!!!!", "Nta at all", "NTA and I'm not sure why you want to be subtle about it. Confront them directly in front of the potential residents!\n\nAlso, call the local housing authority or consult a lawyer because the landlord ignoring health violations is against the law.", "NTA, you have a slumlord.", "Defo WNBTA ! Also, since it seems you are in the UK: I was once in a similar situation, after some digging my flatmates and I discovered that our flat was not properly licensed and we got an RRO and about \u00a36,000 each. Worth looking into it.", "NTA\n\nBut DON\u2019T be discreet, Why do you think this person is a slumlord?

List dates of when you\u2019ve emailed management about the issues. Make it VERY LOUD. They\u2019ll want you to shut up and go away, so they may offer to fix things if you take down the reviews. Tell them fixes first, then reviews might come down depending on the quality of the work. \n\nThey may also offer to let you out of your lease. Tell them that not only do you want out, you want to be fully reimbursed for every month that these issues have been around. A broken toilet might be an issue for a day or two, but longer? No. Same with hot water. You may have the right to sue them, or stop paying rent based on your state.

And your landlord can go chew an iron bar by himself, the only AH here is the landlord. \n\nAlso, is it possible your sickness is caused or aggravated by the neglect of the landlord? I suggest VERY STRONGLY for you to get your closest friendly lawyer and ask what exactly are your rights. You were screwed over for months.
