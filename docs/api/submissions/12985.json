You violating her trust because you were given the slightest amount of BS was also AH behavior. Not sure why, but in telling the truth you are simultaneously the AH and not the AH. You\u2019re the AH for cracking under pressure and you\u2019re also sort of alright for spilling the beans, which may well lead your counterpart on a road to recovery. \n\nYou are not a hero. You\u2019re lucky your counterpart is also an AH for this judgement.", "ESH\n\n\u201cSaw some red flags but dismissed them\u201d.... well then that\u2019s on you. Unleashing on her parents is a little immature. Your issue was with your roommate & you decided to tattle to her parents. Who cares what her parents think, you don\u2019t live with them. If they want to babble on about nonsense, that\u2019s their problem. \n\nYour friend is just an all-around mess & very creepy.\n\nEdit", "NTA\n\nYou are seriously hard core! And that butt plug statement was just amazing. That should go into the burn hall of fame!\n\nBottom line, when someone acts like an asshole, they will be called out. You did just that in the most creative and amazing way possible.", "ESH but I don't blame you erupting that way. She was creepy and a liar.", "NTA. sucks that you had to lose a friend because of her", "Additional context I worked 2 jobs (one full time and one part time) and a graduate student. I wasn't just being lazy to be messy. Also, I helped her family take care of her dog. I faithfully gave my schedule each week so I could help them.", "So I wouldn't have necessarily gone down that ugly route because I am always respectful to people's family. However, they were basically coming after me for not being their daughter's cash cow until her house sold.", "Yeah, it kind of feels that way. I just worked really hard at that time with a 2 jobs, grad school, and taking care of my parents. So my messy ways should not have been their issue and they could have talked to me.\n\nI took a paid day off and they picked at me for that. I wasn't living life and I went off.", "I would have told her. She wouldn't talk to me. Her parents talked for.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude05 I wish I could have been a better person in it. I was just exhausted and thrown into a loop.", "Yeah. That friend I met one time. I met her off of bumble bff. We met and she came over drunk/wasted. I gave her food and water to help her sober up. She was feeling better and my roommate came to hangout. It seemed fine and they seemed to vibe a lot. I left and when I woke up that girl blocked my roommate and I on everything. \n\nI texted this to my roommate and she immediately called me and said \"wow that's weird. I wonder why? She seemed weird.\" I had to push and push my roommate for her to finally tell me they hooked up. She said \"she knew what she was doing.\" It was awful. I feel terrible because of it", "It\u2019s ok. Just because you have been judged an AH in this moment is not a permanent failure of your personality. It\u2019s odd how there is a line where if you don\u2019t spill the beans, you\u2019re enabling an addict. If you do spill the beans, the results vary. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you met the parents, sat them down and said \u201cI\u2019m worried about your daughter.\u201d You were given a slight bit of grief and then unloaded reality onto their lap, lashing out like a caged animal. One way of informing them is rooted in genuine care, the other is throwing a tantrum.", "A better person doesn't mean being a pushover and accepting abuse like that. And if your roommate's mom wanted to get involved in a contract between the two of you, that's on her. It's not like you searched her out on Facebook just to rat her out because of her drug use and butt plugs. She could have kept the beef between you two only between you two without involving mom. Once she did, any fallout between them is on her.", "Err what? How does that equate to predatory behaviour? What is her \u201cdrug\u201d use exactly? Smoking weed everyday?\n\nA friend who \u201cno longer speaks to you\u201d who you also didn\u2019t speak to before, and isn\u2019t a friend or have any kind of actual relationship, just some person who you met on an app once?\n\nHuh? I\u2019m thinking ESH but conflating a random hookup with being a sexual predator is by far the worst thing here. Like if you said that to the wrong person about your former roommate, like a potential employer, she could sue the living shit out of you and you would deserve it. But maybe I\u2019m misreading things. Telling her family that she is a sexual predator is a whole level of fucked up if you\u2019re actually calling that out as sexual assault or something along those lines.\n\nHow exactly did she predate a delivery driver?"]}
