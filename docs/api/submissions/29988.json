And while majority of times I was able to ignore original issue, the scene was impossible to ignore and did spoiled the experience more.\n\nI was not there, so I do not want to judge, but just consider there might be something of teachers feedback.", "NTA\n\nI would understand the behavior if it was like a science museum, but it's the Holocaust museum, a place that commemorates the darkest chapter of the 20th Century.\n\nCalling them out was the right choice. The fact the professor scolded you for this is just ridiculous.", "NTA. Their behavior was disrespectful and totally out of place. Also, you weren't loud on purpose. Calling them out was appropriate here.", "NTA  \n\n\nThere are less and less social norms and repercussions for bad behavior. Speaking up is a part of society. Getting into a screaming match in the middle of a museum (especially that one!) would have been too much. But you reacted properly. The teacher is striving for control, not quiet, IMHO.", "NTA and I commend you.", "You could\u2019ve maybe handled it better but I\u2019m surprised by the amount of people saying E S H. Someone needed to call their behavior out", "ESH. The girls were being disrespectful, but yelling and causing a scene is also disrespectful. You don't want the cure to be worse than the symptom.", "NTA \n\nI mean seriously, I've been there, they literally tell you to keep the talking to a minimum and to be respectful\n\nTalking about going to a party is the opposite of respectful, and your actions were justified", "NTA\n\nTime and place.  I would be horrified if someone was giggling and chatting about a party in the face of the awful things that are in the museum. Your professor should have talked to the whole class before or pulled them aside, apparently, they have never been taught the gravity of certain things.  Some places deserve and have earned reverence.", "YTA. If they were that disruptive, the professor would've corrected it. Sounds like you were just eavesdropping and are jealous, and wanted to virtue signal.", "NTA.\n\nAge is never an excuse for being shitty. Good on you for calling them out. \n\nThe one downside is now they have a villain for the story they will inevitably tell at the party about the trauma they experienced at the Holocaust Museum.", "NTA. Well done for calling out their behaviour. I was recently in a war museum in Arnhem, Netherlands, and had a similar experience with school kids running through the exhibits etc, and we had to talk to their teachers. It's so disrespectful.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s horrible behavior on their part. It would have been better if you were more subdued about your calling them out, but it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of your being an A.", "Nta really. You were right to call them out but you shouldn't have sworn nor raised your voice there.", "NTA. Your prof was just embarrassed. I bet the museum staff appreciated your intervention.", "ESH. I'm betting you were more distracting to everyone than they were. This just sounds like virtue signalling.", "ESH\n\nThey were being disrespectful but considering how loud you spoke you were disrespectful to the people around you as well.", "NO YOU ARE NTA THOSE MFS HAVE NO EMPATHY", "Was it really a \"scene\" or was the professor just embarrassed? I find that people are more and more uncomfortable with confrontation, and any amount of speaking up is considered a \"scene\".", "NTA.\n\nThey deserved to be called out. Their behaviour was unacceptable in a HOLOCAUST museum. That was really uncalled for from them. (sorry if the English was bad,it's not my first language)", "Listen. I have been to plenty Holocaust sites. I live in Europe. They aren\u2019t that far away if you live in Europe.\n\nTo me those places are like cemeteries. Or churches (even tho I am an atheist). Any behaviour that would be considered a faux pas in cemetery or a place of worship, should be abstained from in camps and holocaust museums. Most of them have or should have a dress code (for example, covered knees and arms) and they have a specific decorum that shouldn\u2019t be disturbed out of respect for those that have been victims of this horrendous crime.\n\nSo thank you for calling out that behaviour. No, it wasn\u2019t too loud. The more people heard it, the better.\n\nNTA.", "ESH. They clearly were in the wrong and needed to be called out but it sounds like the way you did it might have made everything worse/caused more of a distraction.", "YTA calling out others bad manners is not cool. Let their behavior linger like a fart.", "NTA, absolutely NTA.", "ESH.", "ESH. They suck for obvious reasons but you're further taking away from the reverence of the moment by being loud.", "YTA for yelling in a museum, full stop.", "YTA. Mind your own business. You aren\u2019t in charge of what is and isn\u2019t allowed to be said at a museum.", "ESH\n\nYou're not in charge of how others act. Yea, they should've been respectful and wait till later to talk about a mixer but again, you're not in charge of others.", "ESH\n\nThey should have waited on that conversation, but who died and made you the morality police?", "ESH.\n\nI mean... you couldn't have shushed them? That's typically how we ask people to be quiet and respectful in museums. \"Show some respect FFS!\" sounds equally disruptive. And then you argued with a professor? \ud83d\ude12 (And btw, I double-majored in History & Judaic Studies so I've been in this situation more than once. I've been to Shoah museums all over the world.) Bad behavior from one group doesn't excuse bad behavior from another. And comparing this to selfies in a CC is simply false equivalency. Keep your voice down in a museum FFS. Other people are trying to learn and have an emotional connection to the exhibits, many of which are interactive, and you yelling and arguing back with your prof was just as disrespectful to them.

Listen, you were probably in the right, but execution wise, maybe could have been more discretion. \n\nRegardless- no good deed goes unpunished\u2026\n\nBTW-Sociology was one of my favorites classes in undergrad.", "YTA.

That's who.", "Well, depending in the situation we have to call out this behavior\nWhen I went to a concentration camp, the guide was telling us to be respectful and that it's a common responsibility for everyone to make sure people respect this sites and memorials and museums. \nAbhorrent behavior needs to be called out.", "Only if they end up the top rated comment. That's something I learnt recently. Beforehand, I thought the bot tallied up all the votes from all comments, but apparently not.", "Thanks. I always forget to do that", "Taking selfies is a very obvious and attention drawing act. All they were doing was talking. Also, this was a school trip that they probably had to go on for a credit. They're not allowed to chat during it??", "Sorry, no.  That's a terrible argument.  She's not in charge of shit and doesn't get to just yell at people in a museum.", "I thought it was 6 million? Does your number include combat deaths or something?", "> Abhorrent behavior needs to be called out.\n\nFortunately, there is this entire range of options between saying nothing and yelling at people and causing a scene..  A stern \"Guys, not here\" would have sufficed."]}
