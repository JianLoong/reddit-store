One huge issue with camps selfish is that many people interpret it as act of approval over what happened there.

Grow up.", "Wow okay bruh you sound like a fun guy", "Ooh how much other stuff do you make up in your head?", "Even if OP screamed at those two idiots, it is a proportional action.

If you think the abstract honor of the dead justifies violence, you have some very weird morals.\n\nAnd we'll have to agree to disagree on the proportionality of the action; the way I see it, there are no 22 year old holocausts survivors, any offense is one taken up in the name of a long-dead third party.\n\nIn that case, it's disrespectful, but it's disrespectful in the abstract sense, kind of like someone wearing shorts and flip-flops to a courthouse is showing contempt for the justice system as a whole but not anyone specifically.\n\nAt that point, action is justified, but it must not be more extreme than the initial slight.
