{"id": 10578, "submission_id": "118lec0", "title": "AITA for not wanting my wife to be a SAHM?", "selftext": "My (28m) wife (28f) recently decided that we wanted to try for a baby, we found out that she was pregnant two months ago which was very exciting news. A few days ago she sat me down and told me that she wanted to be a sahm. \n\nShe does not want to rely on others for childcare which I understand but is not fully convincing for me. Both of our parents live nearby and have expressed that they would be more than happy to help out when needed, I do not intend to rely on them or overburden them with childcare but I do not see an issue with having them to help sometimes.I told her I did not like that idea for the following reasons:\n\n1.) We both make very good money ($200k from me, a bit less from her) and even though I could support a family with only my salary we could afford a lot more with her working.\n\n2.) She will likely make more money than me eventually as I am pretty much capped out in my field and she has more room to move upward in hers.\n\n3.) I simply don\u2019t believe that this lifestyle will result in any good for our family as I have seen so many issues arise with sahp and things like parenting and finances.\n\nAlso, I told her that if she really wanted someone were to stay home and take care of the kid (and eventually 1 maybe 2 more) I would rather do it. I don\u2019t think it would be fair for one of us to leave our jobs as we both generally dislike our work and we both would find it more rewarding to spend time at home with our child (I\u2019m not discount the amount of work that goes into this). She responded to this by saying that it just makes more sense for me to work because I am a man, this kind of ticked me off, and she seemed even more ticked off that I was ticked off about it. \n\nShe has pushed this idea on me several more times since and is beginning to get more and more upset with me as I continue to express my concerns. She seems like she has already made up her mind.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate:\nShe has always been very ambitious and career oriented, we never discussed the possibility of a sahp because it seemed obvious to me that we were both heavily invested in our careers and she never mentioned anything about it.\n \nI see a lot of people saying 200k is more than enough; it is enough to live comfortably. However, we live in a very expensive part of California and will need to buy a bigger house especially if we have more children. We also agree that we want to send our children to private schools and will pay for their college, the double income will go a long way towards this and maybe even grad school if they choose.\n\nTo be clear, I want us both to continue working. I only say that I would rather stay home if she insists that somebody must do it because I think it sounds more appealing and rewarding to spend time with my children. I am not saying it is easy or underestimating the amount of work that goes into it.\n\nUpdate 2:\nI do not WANT to be a sahd, I simply said that if she insists that it is better to have one of us sah then I would rather do it because it seems like the more appealing option and I would be willing to prove it by doing so, and only if we both agreed. \n\nI realize the cost of childcare, what I don\u2019t understand is now people can say it\u2019s going to be expensive to put the kid in daycare when what is going to be even more expensive is losing half of our income; daycare costs nowhere near 200k a year\u2026\n\nSome people are also assuming we have not though things out, we may have been shortsighted on some things (mainly the topic at hand), but just because I did not specify every detail of our plan in my post does not mean we haven\u2019t thought things through.\n\nEdit 3:\nI am not forcing her to get right back to work right after the baby is born like some people are assuming. We have already discussed with her employer and she will get 6 months maternity leave which I understand is more than normal. This is also why this is so surprising to me, she asked her employer about it a month ago and now wants to be a sahm. I also realize there will be tough times when she goes back to work.\n\nI realize that I might need to make some compromise here but I worry that if she leaves her job it will be much harder to find another after a few years of being unemployed.\n\nIn both my family and hers both parents worked full time and led very successful careers, both of us and all of our siblings turned out just fine, I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t be the same.", "created_utc": 1677029805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118lec0/aita_for_not_wanting_my_wife_to_be_a_sahm/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then it's your turn! (You'll get all the screaming & tantrums & potty-training, lol.) And then, once the sprog starts school, you can pick up WFH or part-time work and still be the primary SAHP but also start contributing financially. And best of all on this plan, the kid gets a SAHP there for them the whole time.\n\nIt's worth considering, yes?", "Usually after you get pregnant alot of your thinking changes. I'm sure she is thinking about the baby and worrying alot about the future. You really need to be more understanding here. It's not about she wants to quit her job because she doesn't like it and more about her priorities have changed. You all need to have conversations concerning this but yr response of you should be the one to stay home is petty because the reason behind it. Yr wife genuinely wants to be with her child. Can you say the same? Or do you just want to quit? Everything is a give and take but I would advise you that she is going through so many changes physically mentally emotionally. Be understanding and supportive. You can also split it where she takes a year or 2 off then you do. There are compromises.", "Post-nup.

Once your parents realize they're being taken advantage of, you're probably looking at a good chunk of your income for 5+ years going to daycare or a nanny. My kid is 16yo and we were paying 24K/year for daycare back when he was an infant in a HCOL area that is still no where close in cost to CA. \n\nOnce you have all these details, you need to sit down and talk through what makes the best sense for you.

Adjust your lifestyle to your income and put the right priorities in front!  \n\nWe were much poorer when we had our first kid and much more well off now.  Material things pale in comparison to having our kids raised by us, with our values.  It did require some disciple to not live like we had 2 incomes or like some of our lidless friends.  We both believe it is the way family is meant to be regardless of what our current culture says.

At that point the amount we were putting in to childcare and the stress we were under was no longer worth it and we mutually decided that it would be best if one of us stayed home. \nI feel like there\u2019s a compromise here.

You will not have to go through the pumping sessions every few hours while trying to cope with work. You also won't be going through the hormonal changes she will go through post delivery.

I appreciate you preferring to be the SAHP but the first 6 months (sometimes longer if you breastfeed), it truly is difficult to emotionally detach where mom ends and baby begins.

A few days ago she sat me down and told me that she wanted to be a sahm. \n\nShe does not want to rely on others for childcare which I understand but is not fully convincing for me. Both of our parents live nearby and have expressed that they would be more than happy to help out when needed, I do not intend to rely on them or overburden them with childcare but I do not see an issue with having them to help sometimes.I told her I did not like that idea for the following reasons:\n\n1.) We both make very good money ($200k from me, a bit less from her) and even though I could support a family with only my salary we could afford a lot more with her working.\n\n2.) She will likely make more money than me eventually as I am pretty much capped out in my field and she has more room to move upward in hers.\n\n3.) I simply don\u2019t believe that this lifestyle will result in any good for our family as I have seen so many issues arise with sahp and things like parenting and finances.\n\nAlso, I told her that if she really wanted someone were to stay home and take care of the kid (and eventually 1 maybe 2 more) I would rather do it. I don\u2019t think it would be fair for one of us to leave our jobs as we both generally dislike our work and we both would find it more rewarding to spend time at home with our child (I\u2019m not discount the amount of work that goes into this). She responded to this by saying that it just makes more sense for me to work because I am a man, this kind of ticked me off, and she seemed even more ticked off that I was ticked off about it. \n\nShe has pushed this idea on me several more times since and is beginning to get more and more upset with me as I continue to express my concerns. She seems like she has already made up her mind.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Lots of us do have those talks in advance of parenthood, but good partners always work with each other to allow for change. Also, I would NEVER recommend that either parent fully drop from the work force. In a few years, your child will start school and she or you will likely want to reenter the work force, but will then be at a huge disadvantage. College, a bigger home, and other parenting expenses will make that second income essential, especially in a high cost of living area. You are lucky that both of you are ready and willing to spend time at home with kids; this allows for flexible schedules on both of your parts or taking turns with extended leaves, which is the parenting partnership ideal. Just be patient and flexible with each other and take things as they come without doing something drastic, like full on quitting a job. Our kids had high quality day care a few days a week and they were happier and smarter for the structured peer socialization.", "NTA.

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for you wife who WANTS it. You stated yourself that your preference is that you both keep your jobs. Do you know how hard it is to grow and deliver a whole person and then be forced to leave them before you and the baby are ready? Just because the world we are in forces women and babies to deal with it, doesn\u2019t mean that it is in any way natural for a mom to be separated from her baby or a baby to be separated from their mother. I think there is a compromise that could at least be a conversation. If you force your wife back to work before she wants to, she won\u2019t forget it. This would be an entirely different conversation if you couldn\u2019t afford it or if your stance had been I REALLY want to stay home with our baby, but my wife also wants to stay home with our baby! But that\u2019s not what it is\u2014you don\u2019t want her to stay home and have that time with your baby because you don\u2019t want to be the only one that has to go back to work\u2026that\u2019s different than why SHE wants to do it, and I guarantee you she won\u2019t forget it.

I had the most intense instincts to behave a certain way, do certain things, and those instincts have been honed over the course of millions of years of evolution for women. I remember watching my foster cat have kittens once, she was a first time mom, and she went off in a tiny, dark, isolated \u201ccave\u201d in my closet to do it, ate the placentas, etc\u2026 and I thought it was so odd that she just instinctively knew to do that without training until I got pregnant. I\u2019d never felt compelled to do anything in quite that way before. It was like there was the same biological programming that causes dogs to fetch a ball or salmon to swim up stream, and fighting those urges caused a tremendous amount of anxiety and distress. Being with my newborn 24/7 in the first few months and even beyond that was one of those things. Some women and many men, and you are included in this from the sound of it, just don\u2019t really get the same instincts at this stage.

I can understand her wanting to stay home. She\u2019s about to share a body with this child, push it out, and then run back to work when everything is barely healed (depending on her maternity leave at work. US has notoriously bad maternal leave) and her hormones are a mess. The way she worded \u201cbecause you\u2019re the man\u201d was stupid and sexist I\u2019ll give you that. Technically, yes it makes sense that she stays at home at first for awhile if she wants to breastfeed and just the fact she\u2019s about to deal with a lot medically. Of course after she\u2019s had time to heal and if she doesn\u2019t want to breastfeed, it really doesn\u2019t matter who stays at home. What I don\u2019t like is the \u201cbecause your the man you should work.\u201d I would suggest both of you sitting down and REALLY discussing all the ins and outs.

It\u2019s normally best that one parent stay home if you can afford it. That way the child can be taken care of by one of his/her parents. Obviously, both of you want to stay with your kid. Now, you need to make the decision that is best for your child. Not what you want or what your wife wants. Give your wife time to heal at least. If she wants to stay at home for a year to breastfeed, I would let her. You can then take over for her if you want to be the stay at home parent. Any kind of plan like that that works for both of you. Something that feels like a compromise instead of one person winning and the other losing. You both really won\u2019t even know what you want until the baby comes. She may find taking care of a baby mentally exhausting and want to work. You may find it a joy and want to stay home.

You can't accommodate that.  See if there is a compromise.  Where she can go part time for the next several years and work from home on the days she works (if her line of work will allow this).  At some point that 2nd income is going to come in handy (think college and when they start driving).  And you won't feel like you are solely responsible financially.  Staying home is freaking HARD.  I did everything.  Cook, clean, laundry, shoveled, mowed, paid bills, doctor appointments - EVERYTHING.  I did this so my husband could concentrate on earning enough for us to live comfortably on.  He also helped out A LOT b/c he could work from home and if I was sick, he'd take over or if I needed a break, he'd take the day off so I could.  But all of that stuff fell on me.

Don't take away her choice. Doing so will cause resentment so deep it will almost certainly drive a wedge between you. You will be seperating her from something she cares about more than life itself. The depth of the emotions involved are hard to wrap your head around before having a child. Like if someone tries to come between you and your baby you feel like you could rip them apart with your bare hands  - it is INTENSE. I urge you to continue discussing this with her and come to an agreement you can both feel good about. Maybe she WFH and you get a nanny, maybe she cuts back to part time.

I was driving pretty well career-wise, making more money than I ever had. I never planned on having kids, nor was I ever very nurturing or motherly in general. My husband and I could have afforded daycare easily, and I was fully prepared to put kiddo into daycare at 6 weeks and go back to work. As my pregnancy progressed, the thought of returning to work seemed more and more bleak. I was laid off when I was 8 months pregnant, and emotionally, it was the best thing that could have happened to me. I believe I would have been \"a danger to myself,\" as the professionals say, (I'm not sure what can get me banned) if I had gone back to work. In my experience, there are few things more powerful than the bond between mother and baby. Pregnancy and postpartum hormones are no joke. \n\nSo it could be a mental health issue if your wife goes back to work, especially if she's feeling a desire to stay home, when she previously was very ambitious and career driven.

I still say she\u2019s not TA either because, although I would never want to do it, I would never blame a parent for wanting to stay home.", "Uhh some people don\u2019t love being parents and some people like their jobs. I was a stay at home parent and I MUCH prefer working", "Or she\u2019s pregnant now and her feelings have changed.", "Or maybe just maybe your priorities change when you get pregnant? Have you ever been pregnant?", "yeah i feel like \"decided we wanted to try for a baby\" should include discussions like this because it's literally one of the biggest things. makes me wonder if the conversation was solely \"wanna do it raw and have a mini us\"", "The only thing that makes financial sense is sending the kid to daycare so they can both keep their well paying jobs.", "She can't make that decision on her own. It's not entirely her call.", "It's not a red flag. People's priorities change once they actually have a baby on the way. Just like people are indifferent about kids than all the sudden they meet the love of their life and can't imagine not having kids with them.  I doubt if it was some master plot that she was going to spring on him. When you have a baby inside you, your emotions change. Unfortunately I lost my baby but my priorities completely changed in unexpected ways.  I would agree that she stays home while the child is an infant. There's no better care out there than a loving parent. And see how things happen. She might be starved for adult conversation and as the baby becomes less dependent as far as a predictable sleep schedule and breastfeeding gets farther apart, she might decide to do some consulting freelance from home or something like that around the baby's schedule.  And it can grow from there..", "I mean\u2026 will he be nursing the baby and recovering from pregnancy? \n\nHim being the one that won\u2019t be nursing and birthing the child do play into things.", "I think it\u2019s prob more to do with the fact only she can breastfeed, will need recovery from birth etc.", "Him saying that is to show how hypocritical she is. She doesn't care about her reasoning of think one person should stay home. Her actual reasoning is that she just wants to be a sahm for herself. If her reasoning she was spouting out was true, she'd discuss and consider her husband being the one to stay home or switching. Her immediately denying it shows what her true feelings are. Yeah I agree she should have discussed this instead of trapping him, but then well the trap wouldn't have worked. It's reasonable for OP to assume a career driven woman who's never talked about wanting to be a sahm would continue working.", "and if only one of you could get out, it should definitely be her because \"you're the man\" right? lol", "CA is ridiculous. I know people making 150K, and still can\u2019t afford to buy a house. I\u2019m in CA. I was a SAHM.

Long breaks in employment absolutely destroy future earning potential, and if the working partner loses the ability to work through illness/death/etc. down the road it could absolutely devastate a family financially because the stay-at-home partner will not be able to pick up where they left off.

Some fields are more flexible and a year may not impact too much, if it does, what level of impact is acceptable or fair trade to be able to stay out longer, where consequences would be mamageable long term, but its worth it to them.  It shouldn't always come down to money,  some things are priceless and can't be equated to finances, especially when we are talking about his one income being higher then most two household incomes already at his age. She may be comfortable with a slightly lower standard then he is, hence a continued discussion needs to take place....they have several more months to come to a compromise.  She may be ok with a temporary career set back, for example.\n\nAlso, sometimes 'plans' go out the window when we are faced with parenthood, hormones are raging and maternal instincts can be VERY strong pull, the most laid out plans can go out the window when you are pregnant and feel a fierce desire to be with your child, and even stronger once that bundle is in your arms.  I always knew I would go back to work, but I did everything in my power to budget/save so I could stay out longer then most....I felt completely guilt ridden and was a hot mess when it was time to go back to work, It was harder the 2nd time when I returned after 4 months instead of 5, I felt he was SO little...and my MOTHER who I trust with my LIFE was going to be watching them.  It was a deeply personal struggle, I cried for weeks, I often felt guilt and a longing to stay with them longer, and i knew they were cared for with the utmost love, that of a doting grandmother.  I did pay my mom a monthly fee, lower then daycare, but it is what we agreed on, and it's what she wanted to do, she was also able to take extended breaks to travel w/my dad where I found alternate care with other family/friends.  In my case, if I was able to afford a nanny, I might have chosen that so grandma could be grandma, kwim?  But families pull together and do what we have to for our loved ones. \n\nShoot, I struggled when they started a 2-3 day a week morning little pre-k, and they were 3 and 4 lol.  Looking back, my ex was never financially stable, and it's a good thing I stayed at my job, because we divorced soon after, but I remember being envious and jealous of those with stable marriages/incomes that could stay home for a while or until the kids were in school, I would have loved to have it work out like that.   \n\nI'll be the first to admit, that's not the kind of grandparent I want to be lol-but I also still work fulltime, my mom did not and was open/honest that she was 100pct on board.\n\nMy brothers, his wife stayed at home as he worked his way up, 3 children later, my SIL started nursing school full-time when her youngest was in elementary, my brother fully supported their family and her school, she has worked full-time ever since as an RN.  My younger brother did similar, his wife stayed home until the youngest started pre-k and she went to work (still does) part time and it isn't lucrative but they manage.  I wish I had chosen someone with my brothers characters as a father to my children, I would have stayed home w/out hesitation, alas, my life turned out differently lol", "A lot of breastfeeding moms (at least all the ones from my life) pump on a routine because of the pain they feel if they get out of routine, which makes there be extra bottles ready for when they\u2019re not taking care of the kid.

Obviously not every woman is going to be the same, but OP\u2019s wife said her reasoning \u2014 and that had nothing to do with how the baby was being fed. I don\u2019t know, I think OP\u2019s NTA because something like that requires two yes\u2019s in my opinion and he has every right to say he doesn\u2019t agree, but they definitely need to sit down and have a conversation that doesn\u2019t end in an argument.\n\nEdit: typo", "which, in their situation, doesn't mean much.

Saying OP shouldn't do it solely bc he's a man makes the wife sexist.", "Also he said he\u2019s capped out and can\u2019t make more in his field while she isn\u2019t and could earn more than him so if you want to strictly go by numbers it would make more sense for him to be a sahp then for her to be one . And he also wants to spend time with his children so honestly I think either they both keep working or maybe they both go to part time and so they can each have a week with the baby kinda thing like the first part of the week it\u2019s mommy home then the second part is daddy or vice versa or whatever kinda compromise works but other than that she can\u2019t just be like nope this is what I\u2019m doing cause personally I would leave or septic my future husband did something like this where it\u2019s like oh I\u2019m going to unilaterally decide this is what should happen and I\u2019m going to keep telling you this because I want it and your thoughts and concerns make no difference to me. At least that\u2019s how I would feel if they kept bringing it up and to me that\u2019s just selfish and honestly I dont know if I would want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t consider my feelings or concerns when it comes to decisions stones that should be mutual decisions. \nI understand her wanting to be a sahm I want to be one as well but I\u2019ve told my potential partners this and I\u2019ve also said it depends on our finances and if they make enough that we can be comfortable and I can stay home till their 18 I would love to do that but if financially it doesn\u2019t work and I can only do it for a couple years while they are young then I\u2019m ok with that as well or if financially I can\u2019t at all then that\u2019s also ok does it suck ya it would but I also wouldn\u2019t just bring it up while I\u2019m pregnant especially if it\u2019s something we\u2019ve never discussed before cause this is a decision that needs time and to be thought out now some men are very this is what I want and some want the opposite and they want to be the stay at home parent and some like  op seems to be is he would do either he wants to be with his kids and be a sahp but he also would work so he\u2019s ok doing either.", "Men also don\u2019t have to go through all of the bodily changes, injuries from giving birth, breast feeding for however long she decides to breast feed for, and hope that her and baby have no health issues along the way.

I get arguing against long term, but a year or two is nothing and if a family can swing it one on one care from a parent who wants to do it is the best care. As a man you are equally capable of caring for a child, it's BS for her to claim otherwise, but you don't want to so it's a moot point. \n\nYour mind is about to be blown my how much kids get sick, especially if they go to daycare. My son started part-time at a year and hardly managed to go the first couple months and illness goes on for years. Unless your support network is 100% rock solid someone is going to take a hit at work sometimes. Can the grandparents care for a sick child? Risk getting sick? What about 5 years from now?

And seemingly, plenty of income. I've been married, had a child & both of us worked full-time. Our moms took turns babysitting. When my maternity leave was up (8 weeks--nearly 16 years ago), my MIL (@ the time) constantly reminded me how important it was that my husband get a full night's sleep, b/c he had to get up so early (3:30 AM). Meanwhile, the baby was eating every 3 hours. I also had to work. Nobody ever took into consideration that while I was the one taking care of the baby all during the night, I was still sleep-deprived. And driving with the baby to go to either of our moms. Dangerous. I've been divorced & still worked full-time. Got into a relationship, later had twins & worked full-time. Albeit, my job performance plummeted. To the point that I received numerous verbal & written warnings. Got mandated to counseling (company paid for it). Got demoted. Was put on a 6-week probation period, meaning I wasn't allowed to make 1 mistake during that time. Unfortunately, I did. I was fired just 9 days shy of my 13th work anniversary. I've been a SAHM for 6 years now. No matter if you work or stay home, both are hard. The SAHP needs a full night's sleep, too (talking about when baby is born). PPD is very common.

I plan on going back to work when my baby is older. \n\nThe only thing I am questioning is if your wife and/or yourself needs to evaluate your careers. First, you don't enjoy your jobs, even though you are paid decently. But what is your current WLB?\n\nBefore I became SAHM, I worked in public accounting. Long hours, high stress. I decided that staying in that job with a baby would be detrimental to my mental health and marriage. \n\nI am concerned that your wife is working a demanding job right now and is just trying to figure out how caring for a newborn is going to fit into your lives.\n\nDo you have plans for daycare/after-hours babysitter/house cleaners/lawn care? Do your jobs have maternity/paternity leave? Does her job provide opportunities for her to pump breastmilk, if she plans on breastfeeding? How \"available\" are your in-laws? Are they only available for (planned) date nights, or are they willing and able to care for a sick baby that has been bounced from daycare for having a fever? \n\nFinally, are you prepared to be an equal parent?

I am coaching in the spring though to continue some of my passions as encouraged by my husband. \n\nThere is a chance that she wants to be home to experience the baby. Working moms really struggle emotionally with missing milestones, bonding time, etc. I worked for three weeks and was miserable calling my husband and grandma every ten minutes. Working moms sacrifice a lot to keep their job, and that may be her driving force. You also don\u2019t know what her postpartum experience will be like or how long she will be committed to breastfeeding. \n\nI think you should take this in to account before flat out tell her it\u2019s a bad idea.

It\u2019s physically impossible to just transfer the entire burden to a man.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like OP and his wife both just want out of their careers lmao. Maybe it\u2019s time for them to explore career changes instead if they hate it that much, or maybe OP just has rose-tinted glasses on about the sort of (very unrelenting and sometimes very gross) work that goes into taking care of an infant.", "ETA: Your edit is ridiculous. You want to do it because \u201cit\u2019s the most appealing option.\u201d Your wife wants to do it to be there with your baby during a very important time for her to be there. A time that she can never get back, and 6 months doesn\u2019t cover it. You made it worse. You are being so ridiculously selfish.", "True; however, those are not poverty wages.", "I had a friend that wanted so badly to be a SAHM and she discussed this with her husband several times before getting pregnant. She had planned to quit shortly after coming back from maternity leave. Then she had her baby and on top of what was probably some postpartum depression realized she really did NOT want to be a SAHM and that she appreciated getting the break from her child. Another friend of mine was super ambitious and career oriented. Then she had her first kid and wanted nothing more than to be home with the baby. She still feels this way after kid 3, but works full time for the sake of having more financial stability. She does prioritize her family life when it comes to making career decisions. I've had OBGYNs and pediatricians tell me you won't know until you actually have the baby, but idk I'm sure everyone's experience is different. I think the biggest thing is to try to get on the same page with each other and you may need to do that with a therapist who can offer an unbiased and productive environment to have that conversation.", "It\u2019s understandable that when pregnant, your wife is now thinking about the realities of childcare. \nYou should consider an Au pair, or nanny. It would give you the flexibility to have the kids home with you or your wife, and allow the grandparents to take them for fun and not responsibility. \nYou don\u2019t mention the field that you or your wife work in, if it will simply be hard for whoever stays home to reach full earning potential or if the career would be closed after leaving.", "I guess we flip a coin and decide which parent gets to watch them grow up.", "DAYUMMMMMM! Now he\u2019s 100% TA. He\u2019s using his wife to pay alimony and child support. What a sneaky turd.", "There are other compromises, they could both go to part time or working from home. Honestly this should have been discussed and decided before they got pregnant.", "I don't disagree. That's largely why I haven't judged this, because I think there's a lot more nuance to this than meets the eye.\n\nMy point is that they actually have the financial means to do this, which is an absolute privilege. Does that mean Mom automatically gets to be the stay at home parent? Of course not. It absolutely needs to be a discussion. No doubt.\n\nBut mom is also a mess of hormones right now and will be after the baby is born. I feel like OP is looking at this from the point of view of \"I'd also like to stay home and not go to work\" as opposed to \"there is an additional biological component here that I need to be cognizant of when discussing this with my wife\".", "If you plan on being a SAHP then it's on you to tell your partner that. It's an asshole move to spring it.\n\nNTA", "It's on both of them for not discussing their expectations ahead of time. ESH"]}
