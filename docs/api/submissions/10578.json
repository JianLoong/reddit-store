A few days ago she sat me down and told me that she wanted to be a sahm. \n\nShe does not want to rely on others for childcare which I understand but is not fully convincing for me. Both of our parents live nearby and have expressed that they would be more than happy to help out when needed, I do not intend to rely on them or overburden them with childcare but I do not see an issue with having them to help sometimes.I told her I did not like that idea for the following reasons:\n\n1.) We both make very good money ($200k from me, a bit less from her) and even though I could support a family with only my salary we could afford a lot more with her working.\n\n2.) She will likely make more money than me eventually as I am pretty much capped out in my field and she has more room to move upward in hers.\n\n3.) I simply don\u2019t believe that this lifestyle will result in any good for our family as I have seen so many issues arise with sahp and things like parenting and finances.\n\nAlso, I told her that if she really wanted someone were to stay home and take care of the kid (and eventually 1 maybe 2 more) I would rather do it. I don\u2019t think it would be fair for one of us to leave our jobs as we both generally dislike our work and we both would find it more rewarding to spend time at home with our child (I\u2019m not discount the amount of work that goes into this). She responded to this by saying that it just makes more sense for me to work because I am a man, this kind of ticked me off, and she seemed even more ticked off that I was ticked off about it. \n\nShe has pushed this idea on me several more times since and is beginning to get more and more upset with me as I continue to express my concerns. She seems like she has already made up her mind.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate:\nShe has always been very ambitious and career oriented, we never discussed the possibility of a sahp because it seemed obvious to me that we were both heavily invested in our careers and she never mentioned anything about it.\n \nI see a lot of people saying 200k is more than enough; it is enough to live comfortably. However, we live in a very expensive part of California and will need to buy a bigger house especially if we have more children. We also agree that we want to send our children to private schools and will pay for their college, the double income will go a long way towards this and maybe even grad school if they choose.\n\nTo be clear, I want us both to continue working. I only say that I would rather stay home if she insists that somebody must do it because I think it sounds more appealing and rewarding to spend time with my children. I am not saying it is easy or underestimating the amount of work that goes into it.\n\nUpdate 2:\nI do not WANT to be a sahd, I simply said that if she insists that it is better to have one of us sah then I would rather do it because it seems like the more appealing option and I would be willing to prove it by doing so, and only if we both agreed. \n\nI realize the cost of childcare, what I don\u2019t understand is now people can say it\u2019s going to be expensive to put the kid in daycare when what is going to be even more expensive is losing half of our income; daycare costs nowhere near 200k a year\u2026\n\nSome people are also assuming we have not though things out, we may have been shortsighted on some things (mainly the topic at hand), but just because I did not specify every detail of our plan in my post does not mean we haven\u2019t thought things through.", "created_utc": 1677029805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118lec0/aita_for_not_wanting_my_wife_to_be_a_sahm/", "score": 331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then it's your turn! (You'll get all the screaming & tantrums & potty-training, lol.) And then, once the sprog starts school, you can pick up WFH or part-time work and still be the primary SAHP but also start contributing financially. And best of all on this plan, the kid gets a SAHP there for them the whole time.\n\nIt's worth considering, yes?", "Usually after you get pregnant alot of your thinking changes. I'm sure she is thinking about the baby and worrying alot about the future. You really need to be more understanding here. It's not about she wants to quit her job because she doesn't like it and more about her priorities have changed. You all need to have conversations concerning this but yr response of you should be the one to stay home is petty because the reason behind it. Yr wife genuinely wants to be with her child. Can you say the same? Or do you just want to quit? Everything is a give and take but I would advise you that she is going through so many changes physically mentally emotionally. Be understanding and supportive. You can also split it where she takes a year or 2 off then you do. There are compromises.", "Post-nup.

That's not as needed. That's an additional full-time job that your parents should be paid to do.\n\nYou also need to look at the prices of daycare and nannies in your area. Once your parents realize they're being taken advantage of, you're probably looking at a good chunk of your income for 5+ years going to daycare or a nanny. My kid is 16yo and we were paying 24K/year for daycare back when he was an infant in a HCOL area that is still no where close in cost to CA. \n\nOnce you have all these details, you need to sit down and talk through what makes the best sense for you.

Material things pale in comparison to having our kids raised by us, with our values.  It did require some disciple to not live like we had 2 incomes or like some of our lidless friends.

Although I\u2019ve been defending OP, I\u2019m not sure that I agree with them\u2026 at all. Having a consistent and present caregiver is important, and with all that disposable income you got, having a SAHP might be for the best.

My husband and I met in college and had the exact same job. Legitimately exact same job. We were even hired the same place after graduation. I worked until my second was six months old. At that point the amount we were putting in to childcare and the stress we were under was no longer worth it and we mutually decided that it would be best if one of us stayed home. \nI feel like there\u2019s a compromise here. Maybe take as much time off as her job allows. Some places that is 3 months or more.

She's got a really outdated view on this sorta thing. You have legit reasons for being concerned and she seems like she isn't even taking your concerns into consideration.

You will not have to go through the pumping sessions every few hours while trying to cope with work. You also won't be going through the hormonal changes she will go through post delivery.

I appreciate you preferring to be the SAHP but the first 6 months (sometimes longer if you breastfeed), it truly is difficult to emotionally detach where mom ends and baby begins.

A few days ago she sat me down and told me that she wanted to be a sahm. \n\nShe does not want to rely on others for childcare which I understand but is not fully convincing for me. Both of our parents live nearby and have expressed that they would be more than happy to help out when needed, I do not intend to rely on them or overburden them with childcare but I do not see an issue with having them to help sometimes.I told her I did not like that idea for the following reasons:\n\n1.) We both make very good money ($200k from me, a bit less from her) and even though I could support a family with only my salary we could afford a lot more with her working.\n\n2.) She will likely make more money than me eventually as I am pretty much capped out in my field and she has more room to move upward in hers.\n\n3.) I simply don\u2019t believe that this lifestyle will result in any good for our family as I have seen so many issues arise with sahp and things like parenting and finances.\n\nAlso, I told her that if she really wanted someone were to stay home and take care of the kid (and eventually 1 maybe 2 more) I would rather do it. I don\u2019t think it would be fair for one of us to leave our jobs as we both generally dislike our work and we both would find it more rewarding to spend time at home with our child (I\u2019m not discount the amount of work that goes into this). She responded to this by saying that it just makes more sense for me to work because I am a man, this kind of ticked me off, and she seemed even more ticked off that I was ticked off about it. \n\nShe has pushed this idea on me several more times since and is beginning to get more and more upset with me as I continue to express my concerns. She seems like she has already made up her mind.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Lots of us do have those talks in advance of parenthood, but good partners always work with each other to allow for change. Also, I would NEVER recommend that either parent fully drop from the work force. In a few years, your child will start school and she or you will likely want to reenter the work force, but will then be at a huge disadvantage. College, a bigger home, and other parenting expenses will make that second income essential, especially in a high cost of living area. You are lucky that both of you are ready and willing to spend time at home with kids; this allows for flexible schedules on both of your parts or taking turns with extended leaves, which is the parenting partnership ideal. Just be patient and flexible with each other and take things as they come without doing something drastic, like full on quitting a job. Our kids had high quality day care a few days a week and they were happier and smarter for the structured peer socialization.", "NTA.

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for you wife who WANTS it. You stated yourself that your preference is that you both keep your jobs. Do you know how hard it is to grow and deliver a whole person and then be forced to leave them before you and the baby are ready? Just because the world we are in forces women and babies to deal with it, doesn\u2019t mean that it is in any way natural for a mom to be separated from her baby or a baby to be separated from their mother. I think there is a compromise that could at least be a conversation. If you force your wife back to work before she wants to, she won\u2019t forget it. This would be an entirely different conversation if you couldn\u2019t afford it or if your stance had been I REALLY want to stay home with our baby, but my wife also wants to stay home with our baby! But that\u2019s not what it is\u2014you don\u2019t want her to stay home and have that time with your baby because you don\u2019t want to be the only one that has to go back to work\u2026that\u2019s different than why SHE wants to do it, and I guarantee you she won\u2019t forget it.

I had the most intense instincts to behave a certain way, do certain things, and those instincts have been honed over the course of millions of years of evolution for women. I remember watching my foster cat have kittens once, she was a first time mom, and she went off in a tiny, dark, isolated \u201ccave\u201d in my closet to do it, ate the placentas, etc\u2026 and I thought it was so odd that she just instinctively knew to do that without training until I got pregnant. I\u2019d never felt compelled to do anything in quite that way before. It was like there was the same biological programming that causes dogs to fetch a ball or salmon to swim up stream, and fighting those urges caused a tremendous amount of anxiety and distress. Being with my newborn 24/7 in the first few months and even beyond that was one of those things. Some women and many men, and you are included in this from the sound of it, just don\u2019t really get the same instincts at this stage. I remember breaking down even at the thought of having to leave him, knowing that many mothers are forced to.

I can understand her wanting to stay home. She\u2019s about to share a body with this child, push it out, and then run back to work when everything is barely healed (depending on her maternity leave at work. US has notoriously bad maternal leave) and her hormones are a mess. The way she worded \u201cbecause you\u2019re the man\u201d was stupid and sexist I\u2019ll give you that. Technically, yes it makes sense that she stays at home at first for awhile if she wants to breastfeed and just the fact she\u2019s about to deal with a lot medically. Of course after she\u2019s had time to heal and if she doesn\u2019t want to breastfeed, it really doesn\u2019t matter who stays at home. What I don\u2019t like is the \u201cbecause your the man you should work.\u201d I would suggest both of you sitting down and REALLY discussing all the ins and outs.

It\u2019s normally best that one parent stay home if you can afford it. That way the child can be taken care of by one of his/her parents. Obviously, both of you want to stay with your kid. Now, you need to make the decision that is best for your child. Not what you want or what your wife wants. Give your wife time to heal at least. If she wants to stay at home for a year to breastfeed, I would let her. You can then take over for her if you want to be the stay at home parent. Any kind of plan like that that works for both of you. Something that feels like a compromise instead of one person winning and the other losing. You both really won\u2019t even know what you want until the baby comes. She may find taking care of a baby mentally exhausting and want to work. You may find it a joy and want to stay home.

You can't accommodate that.  See if there is a compromise.  Where she can go part time for the next several years and work from home on the days she works (if her line of work will allow this).  At some point that 2nd income is going to come in handy (think college and when they start driving).  And you won't feel like you are solely responsible financially.  Staying home is freaking HARD.  I did everything.  Cook, clean, laundry, shoveled, mowed, paid bills, doctor appointments - EVERYTHING.  I did this so my husband could concentrate on earning enough for us to live comfortably on.  He also helped out A LOT b/c he could work from home and if I was sick, he'd take over or if I needed a break, he'd take the day off so I could.  But all of that stuff fell on me.  I also love to shovel snow and mow (and clean).  It's very relaxing for me.  With 3 kids, I took my me time however I could get it.  haha. But it is a lot.

If her job allows, could she take an extended leave, around 6 months or a year?   Some places are more flexible then others, but in my industry I've seen this done.  When I had my sons, long time ago, we lived an a fraction of that, but I worked overtime in pregnancy, we budgeted and I was able to take off 5 months with my first, and 4 months with my second.  As hard as it was going back even then, I could not fathom how parents to go back when their babies are 6-8 weeks, and frankly I would have preferred to take 6 months both times at minimum if we could, a year would have been my ideal.  \n\nWould she be open to an extended leave, and then hiring a nanny?  There are many ways to vet them, including safety measure as cameras, background checks, etc.  \n\nHere's another idea, she takes 1 year, you take the next, and rotate until they start school (if it's easy to enter/exit your respective work field). Or even her take 2 years, you the next 1 or 2, getting you to pre-k age (of course this could extend longer if you have another child).  \n\nI think the argument of 'my pay tops off' isn't really valid, as you can realistically adjust your budgets, living conditions to whichever salary you are both living on.  Some women think like she does, that the guy should be working, it's just how society is set up, with moms being seen as the more 'nurturing', especially during the time they are babies/toddlers.   I think that you should also be open to hear her out more, if it's affordable and all in agreement, personally I feel having one parent at home is an ideal situation, and a luxury many people don't have, but if you CAN afford it, why not?

If someone wants to breastfeed then formula is a hard no.      \nI'm merely pointing out that for many women, pumping doesn't work, making you wrong.", "A good pediatrician would only care that the child is being fed, whether it was from breast milk or formula.", "They\u2019ll recommend breast but ultimately don\u2019t care as long as the baby is healthy", "Why can't he do what he feels is best for his baby?   He can always go back to work after the kid is in school too.", "No, not for \"many women\". For YOU, and your generalizing your experience onto the population.", "False. A good pediatrician would encourage breast feeding first and foremost. Formula if mother won't or can't. Yiur kind is not one I'd let near my children.", "Yes, they do care. But you know that. Don't you?", "Would it not make more sense for her to stay at home, care for the baby, and heal from her pregnancy? He said he wants to stay at home because he hates his job, she wants to stay at home to take care of their kid (and heal I presume). His justification doesn\u2019t sound all that convincing if we are worried about the level of care the kid will receive. Especially if he thinks caring for a newborn is going to be more enjoyable than his current form of employment. This is their first kid, I don\u2019t think he knows what he\u2019s in for.", "\" For many women\" is correct", "[removed]", "Yeah they care the baby is fed either way and healthy", "She can heal in a couple of months. That's family leave. Then she can go back to work and he can take over for the next five years.   \n\nWhy does SHE think that caring for a newborn is more enjoyable than HER current form of employment? Why isn't she being asked that question? She doesn't want her child raised by caregivers. He's as much a parent as she is.  Problem solved.", "Many women can't breastfeed at all.  Therefore breastfeeding is totally irrelevant to who stays home with the kid.", "[removed]"]}
