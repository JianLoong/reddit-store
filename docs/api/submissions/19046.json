My family is disappointed in me after my sister\u2019s wedding weekend extravaganza\u2026", "selftext": "TL/DR: Family very disappointed in me for leaving post-wedding lunch \u201cearly\u201d, after having done so much leading up to the wedding.\n\n\nMy older sister\u2019s wedding was last weekend. For context, my parents favor the heck out of her more than me. She can\u2019t do anything wrong, they always provide an excuse for her, etc. Fast forward and I quite literally planned her husband\u2019s engagement because he doesn\u2019t plan anything, took free engagement pictures and have done nothing but listen about this damn wedding for 1.5 years.\n\n\nWedding day comes and it\u2019s just a lot. Went from 8am to midnight non-stop with pictures, ceremony, more pictures and the reception. It was a really, really long day. My parents wanted to have a follow-up party at their house the next day. My SO and I were completely drained, but still went of course because it\u2019s my sister. After being there about 2.5hrs, we said our goodbyes and went home. Walking out the door, my sister calls me out in front of the remaining people there for \u201cleaving early during her wedding weekend.\u201d She said I was being a bad brother, etc.\n\n\nToday I get a call from my parents saying they are not mad, just very disappointed in me, and how I made the family look bad for not being there for my sister. Now I feel like my family looks down on me even more, even after how much I feel I\u2019ve done for my sister and how much money I\u2019ve put towards the wedding and her gift. \n\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1685979776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141ilwp/aita_my_family_is_disappointed_in_me_after_my/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good on you for getting the hell out.", "Even a command performance for the queen only lasts a couple of hours. NTA", "NTA.  It's called a wedding day, not a wedding weekend.  If they want to celebrate over that long of a time frame, that's their prerogative to do so. But they cannot insist that others join them.", "NTA at all. This happened to me. I basically put together a whole wedding in 24 hours because the bridal couple was shit at planning. I barely slept. After the ceremony was over and the reception had begun, I left because I was completely exhausted and pissed. The bride was \u201csoooo sad\u201d I left early. \n\nYou stuck it out way longer than I could have. Let them be disappointed. Their problem.", "NTA at all. \n\nOP you need to start saying no to these expectations. If your sister picked a bf that can't plan out his engagement then let his engagement fail. You can not pick up the slack of others and run yourself drained. You seem very kind for offering so much but that is too much for any person. In the future you should start setting up boundaries when there are major events.", "It is her party, but people should not be held hostage for a weekend!  She and your family are wrong for trying to guilt or shame you.  She can celebrate her wedding as she sees fit, but not everyone has to be included. NTA!!", "NTA \n\nSend your sister a bill for all the pictures and work you put in. If she wants to treat you like hired help, you should at least get paid.", "NTA - It's an AH move to call people out for \"leaving early\" after they've been at a party for 2.5 hours after an all day wedding.", "Please don't feel bad\n\nAlso...please consider going low to no contact with your family\n\nThey are never going to change\n\nPerhaps its time you focused on your life instead of desperately hoping your family will ever be anything other than what they have always been\n\nSo cut them off\n\nBut if I were you, I would send them a detailed list of every single time you felt slighted because of how they favored her over you.\n\nPut it all out there in the open and make it clear that until they apologize and make amends, you see no real reason to keep them in your life\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that they created a monster in your sister and without you to pick up her slack...they are going to realize pretty quickly that they can only count on one kid and it's the one they ran off\n\nNTA", "NTA but no amount of money or time commitment is gonna make your family treat you better. You sound like you\u2019d be better off focusing on yourself and your SO going forward Vs your family", "NTA  it sound exhausting in every way! You deserve a break, the wedding was over.  They can F off for not being understanding that you were burned out.  It was incredibly rude of your sister to say anything.  \n\nIf you want to be petty show her what a bill for the photography would be and tell her that you \"leaving early\" was in lieu of charging her.", "NTA.  You put in enough of an appearance to be polite.  If they were worried about looking bad, it was the night after a wedding that went until midnight.  They could have just said that you had a hangover.", "INFO: Did you also photograph the wedding? It's a little unclear from your post.  \n\nNTA. You've given more than most could. Let them be disappointed.  You aren't required to light yourself on fire to keep your family warm.", "NTA. My response to that level of \u201cdisappointed\u201d (code for unwarranted criticism) is to say \u201cI\u2019m disappointed you\u2019re disappointed and let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201d They will never understand so no point in attempting to defend yourself. Lower your expectations (and contact if necessary) and live your life. Sorry they are AHs.", "NTA. A wedding weekend is just too much.", "NTA. Fun stuff.", "Your sister and parents behaved badly. Ignore whatever nonsense they say about this. \n\nOne thing to think about, though: you may have done more than you wanted to, more than you could afford (financially or emotionally) and set yourself up to feel unappreciated. Your participation went far beyond anything I would have done, especially in light of how your parents favor your sister over you.", "NTA.", "NTA apparently you needed to pass out at the party for them to accept that you were exhausted and needed to go", "NTA.\n\n\u201cDear family,\n\nI am so pleased that Sister\u2019s wedding went off without a hitch, and SO and I were proud and happy to celebrate with the family and the happy couple. Congratulations, Sister and BIL! You have our sincere love and earnest blessings.\n\nWe wish we could have stayed longer at the afterparty, and we are so happy we came. Thank you for a wonderful wedding weekend. Unfortunately, we had a lot of household prep to do before returning to work this week, and we hope you can appreciate that.\n\nMazel tov!\n\nOP and SO.\u201d", "NTA. Obv.  Your family can go pound sand.", "NTA. Stop trying to please these people.", "Big time NTA. \n\nSince the family already looks down on you, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll miss you when you go no contact for a while and work on yourself. And by working on yourself, taking a vacation away from them would be a good start. \ud83d\ude00", "NTA, you do realize you don't have to acquiesce to their every demand right? You did more than your part for someone else's wedding even if that someone else is your sister. They sound ungrateful as all get out.

You don't specify.", "YTA - close family members are the last to leave.", "NTA. Why the hell wasn\u2019t she on her honeymoon? \n\n2.5 hours sounds like a super long lunch.", "NTA Send an itemised list of your time and money that was used for this wedding. Then ask how much more should you have invested, how much is enough to not be constantly shamed in their eyes.\n\nTell them as you\u2019ve just been treated like staff ask for the money back and for payment of your time and state if they aren\u2019t willing to do that then you are quite happy to cut them out of your life.\n\nThen go your own way and live your life out of their shadow as you know damn sure they will never take your side.", "OP took hours of photographs for his sister and yet his family is still complaining he didn't do enough and is a disappointment . Looks like they don't want those photos OP - may as well delete them!", "NTA. Stop bending over backwards for your asshole family. Stop caring what they think and go low contact (grey rock them).", "NTA- you didn\u2019t leave the wedding early just the after after party, you went stayed for 2.5 hours. What was the expectation for goodness sake!", "DEAR GOD WHEN WILL WEDDING SEASON BE OVER?!?", "NTA! You did a lot for her wedding did anyone thank you? Or did they just give you a hard time for leaving? Sometimes it\u2019s okay to just do what\u2019s best for you. Obviously, whatever you do to help them will never be enough to put you in their good graces. I learned a hard but true lesson. Just because your related by blood doesn\u2019t mean you have to like those relatives! Don\u2019t let them guilt you anymore!", "NTA I can\u2019t people for as long as you managed", "Stop it...just stop...stop doing so much for them. They are ungrateful", "With that attitude, Sister will be looking for your help on wedding #2 in no time.  Take some joy in sitting that one out completely.  NTA", "Seriously, a rehearsal, rehearsal dinner plus a 16h+ wedding day is enough. She's lucky OP even turned up to the after party, if I were in OPs shoes I wouldn't have even gone to the after party because I would be too exhausted.", "Haha I love this.\n\n\nSpot on\n\nOp NTA", "Then go your own way and live your life out of their shadow because you know they will never take your side.", "Jfc, my scenario doesn\u2019t even compare to yours! Kudos to you for the work you put in.", "I appreciate it Essay. That\u2019s my plan moving forward. It\u2019s just disappointing because I know that when my engagement and wedding day comes, I know my family won\u2019t give nearly as much of a shit for that day as they did for my sister\u2019s.", "Are you serious?\n\nBro put all that energy into the wedding and didn\u2019t say he regretted it or that anyone abused him. He just said he\u2019s done now.\n\nSure, anyone *can* go low/no contact at any time but we have been given no reason to think he wants to or should. If he has grievances, he could try communicating them.\n\nI think perhaps you\u2019re projecting.", "Wondering the same thing\u2026", "I messaged my family and said \u201cSorry for being a disappointment for the whole family\u201d haha. I\u2019m so done with this shit.", "Did not photograph the wedding. I planned the engagement and took pictures of it happening, then pictures of them with the ring and whatnot.", "Definitely not in that culture.", "That tradition seems a bit of being an AH as well, unless the country lets you off for an entire week with pay", "Lol who are you, the sister?\n\nListen OP you are NTA. I don't see how you being at that party another X number of hours helps add to your sister's feeling of being the center of attention in a practical sense.\n\nHas the same vibe of a dead kings guards getting murdered to be buried with him. Thr king doesn't need to see it, but just knowing it will happen is enough to make him feel good for a second.\n\nYour sister doesn't need to see you at the party, but she does need to know she has complete control or else she won't get maximum pleasure from the event.", "Even after the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner, 16+hr wedding day AND the post-wedding party?", "Nah, not in my extended family. The last group is the close friend age-mates of the bride and groom (which would arguably also include OP).\n\nBut even if it were true, that\u2019s for the wedding day. Not the hangover party or whatever that the parents of the bride insist on throwing. There\u2019s no special etiquette around that.", "Accidentally took a 2hr nap after the post-wedding party\u2026and I don\u2019t nap lol", "I find yours worse! A whole ass wedding WEEKEND? After 1.5 years of wedding talk and planning? Even as a simple guest I\u2019d have bailed after the first day. Shit\u2019s exhausting.", "don't invite them. cut them from your life. life is better when you cut assholes from your life.", "You should read the very first sentence after the tdlr\u2026OP makes it clear their sister is the golden child of the family and has always been put first. \n\nReading comprehension", "As you should be! Hope you got a nice looooong nap in.", "Don\u2019t. You\u2019re so much more than this. Tell them they truth;  I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed but after arranging an engagement, 1.5 years of planning and 16 hours of picking up all the problems, I think I deserve more. A thank you maybe? A take a nap, you deserved it? \n\nSo NTA. But you deserve that thank you", "Still...that is a loooooong day. And then for them to come back the next day and say \"you should have given us MORE of your time\", ridiculous.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong. You were totally there for your sister. If they can't see that, they are the ones with issues.", "No, this person is bonkers. Even if it were the actual wedding day, I'd disagree with this. Most of the weddings I've been to, the bride and groom stayed up partying with friends and close family went to bed.\n\nNTA but do yourself a favour and stop trying to please these people. I can tell you from personal experience that nothing you will do will ever be good enough. Focus your energies on people who value you and appreciate your efforts. You deserve better.", "It\u2019s an unsaid rule, close family stays till the end and are the last one to leave. Just because you haven\u2019t heard about it, doesn\u2019t mean squat", "I know what you mean, I don't nap either so when I very rarely do, it means I'm beyond exhausted lol.\n\nYou did more than enough, and over an entire weekend too.\n\nBesides it's a party *invitation*, it's not a legal *summons*. Your family needs to learn the difference.", "For context, I didn\u2019t plan the wedding weekend. Just the engagement and engagement pictures. I was a groom, so was still involved for rehearsal and the whole wedding day and post-wedding party.", "Second sentence.\n\nI read every word.\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t mean that OP is being abused to the degree that no contact is wanted or needed. OP doesn\u2019t indicate that in any way. He\u2019s just tired out after the wedding. That\u2019s all.\n\nThere can be less-than-ideal family dynamics without there also being the scorched earth approach of no contact. People are complicated.", "Thank you!", "It means it\u2019s not an actual rule. I\u2019m not the only one who said it doesn\u2019t work that way in weddings around them.", "Oh yeah I know, it\u2019s just a super long event and with everything else you contributed leading up to it - there\u2019s just no way you\u2019re at fault here.", "You must have missed it. Read it again. Also, I said it was the first sentence AFTER the tdlr (that pesky reading comprehension again). \n\nYou are wrong.", "There is nothing wrong with taking a sabbatical if you don't feel valued.  See how you feel after the 30-60 days.", "Much appreciated!", "It\u2019s the second sentence after. The first sentence after is \u201cMy older sister\u2019s wedding was last weekend.\u201d The period is the end of that sentence.\n\nI frankly don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bothering to write this comment. There\u2019s nothing useful that will come of talking to you further."]}
