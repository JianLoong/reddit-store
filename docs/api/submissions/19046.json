For context, my parents favor the heck out of her more than me. She can\u2019t do anything wrong, they always provide an excuse for her, etc. Fast forward and I quite literally planned her husband\u2019s engagement because he doesn\u2019t plan anything, took free engagement pictures and have done nothing but listen about this damn wedding for 1.5 years.\n\n\nWedding day comes and it\u2019s just a lot. Went from 8am to midnight non-stop with pictures, ceremony, more pictures and the reception. It was a really, really long day. My parents wanted to have a follow-up party at their house the next day. My SO and I were completely drained, but still went of course because it\u2019s my sister. After being there about 2.5hrs, we said our goodbyes and went home. Walking out the door, my sister calls me out in front of the remaining people there for \u201cleaving early during her wedding weekend.\u201d She said I was being a bad brother, etc.\n\n\nToday I get a call from my parents saying they are not mad, just very disappointed in me, and how I made the family look bad for not being there for my sister. Now I feel like my family looks down on me even more, even after how much I feel I\u2019ve done for my sister and how much money I\u2019ve put towards the wedding and her gift. \n\n\nAITA here?\n\n\n*Edit: Forgot to mention that no friends were invited to this post-wedding party and almost none of the bridal party came.\n\n\n*Edit 2: I took pictures of the *engagement*, NOT the wedding itself.", "created_utc": 1685979776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141ilwp/aita_my_family_is_disappointed_in_me_after_my/", "score": 1928, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's been saying \"no\" ever since, and the past 5 years have been ten times happier than our first 10.\n\nThat last ridiculous request: My BIL was cooking a family dinner at my MIL's (which required my MIL to spend $750+ on groceries for 8 adults and 3 toddlers - a common way my MIL pampers her spoiled little brat, despite bitching to us about him over that stuff after every visit), and threw a tantrum over the pasta brand.  He insisted my wife and I drive out of our way, and show up 30 minutes late, so she could buy him 5 boxes of imported pasta ($14.95 each).  He did this exact same thing once before, cooked two, only needed one, and brought the other three home (of course!).  I was fucking pissed the first time he did this, and kept telling my wife to call back \"No, you need to go yourself\". We fought a lot about it over the following week - we have long work hours, so the 30 minutes on a weekend is really precious and I don't like wasting it in a car and parking lot.
