Plus, op may need physical therapy after the surgery.", "NTA but GET YOUR CREDIT MONITORED (like equifax and such)  because pretty sure she is trying to do identity theft and open credit cards/ lines/ loans in YOUR name and ruin your financial future. \n\nBTW you don't need her and cutting her will provide you with immense peace and wellbeing, consider it.", "NTA. Don't hand over that birth certificate.  I hate to say it but it's very possible she's setting you up for a \"stolen identity\" scenario and the next thing you know you'll have a massive credit card debt.", "Yes you are ungrateful because what has she done for you to be grateful?  If you are a disappointment to her, she is an even bigger disappointment to you.  NTA.  Don\u2019t give her any of your personal information because she is not to be trusted.  She really will only bring you down as you are starting your adult life.  She is privileged that you have not cut her off.", "Hey as far away from her as fast as you can. NTA", "While you are nta - if she is paying for \"family health insurance\", and you need her to, that is something to think about. \n\nBut - its probably best to cut off all dealings w her - esp in light of the apartment issue.", "NTA just ignore your mother. She and your brother are beyond help. Be more careful in the future. You don't want another avoidable injury. Also freeze your credit report and always monitor your credit on credit karma.

If she wants your birth certificate she can get it from the government.  You don't have to participate in her scam.  No contact would be my advice.  NTA", "NTA. If she has that kind of debt, she may be **trying to get credit in YOUR name.**  In the US if someone has your Social Security number and birth certificate they can open up credit cards in the name of the person.  It's IDENTITY THEFT.  I'm not sure where you are, but her wanting YOUR birth certificate seems suspicious.  I personally would definitely NOT be giving it to her because Identity Theft can be done no matter what country you are in and it can ruin your life, your credit and affect your job prospects, your ability to own or even rent a home, get a car or so many other things.  \n\nKeep saying no and stay strong.  If her work \"needs the information\" ask for the person's name who is requesting the info and go to them IN PERSON to ask if they need it, and what for.

Way to bury the lede, OP. Your mother is an addict. Full stop.

So if she was covered when the surgery started, she's covered. Or the ER visit.

What I got was a certificate that said that a birth certificate for <my name and date> is on file with the state.  Seemed weird to me, but I sent it in and got the passport.", "In the US, federal offices have access to certain state databases. When I got married and went from filing taxes as \"single, unmarried\" to \"married, file joint\", all I had to do was confirm the state and that it occured after some date (don't remember the date, I wasn't even born yet, so definitely got married after that). IRS got with SSA and the state to confirm the marriage AND that I'd legally changed my name everywhere on their own (I was filing under married name, but the W2s and all were under maiden.)\n\nI'd assume marriage certificates and birth certificates are in the same/similar \"vital records\" database that the fed can get to. \n\nOP mentioned \"petrol\" not gas, so idk if they're in the US though. May be different for them."]}
