Momma Bear can get f-ed sideways.", "NTA it's your home, the fence is in line with all local byelaws, it is improving quality of life for you and your Good Bois, and your neighbour gets no say in it.\n\nI am a very pet obsessed person and when our next door neighbours had a bunny when I was a tiny child I loved when he would get into our garden, but I never held him hostage or encouraged it to get more Bunny Time. It was clear that it was Neighbour's Bunny not My Bunny. Now I am a grown ass adult with a doggo who is Far More Sociable than I am, and I let her wag her tail at the neighbours and we all have fun interacting, but it's always respectful of my dog's boundaries.\n\nThose kids are not in charge of your dogs, the parents are clearly not in charge of their kids. If they keep coming over, or trying to interfere with your fence I think the phrase is hippity hoppity get off my property? I'd definitely keep a good eye on your fence where it borders the neighbours' house in case the kids or the parents try to damage it to gain access to the dogs again.", "Her reaction shows you were perfectly correct to install the better fence.", "She's been using your dog to keep her kids entertained. Now she has to do something herself, that's why she's pissed.", "that actually sounds plausible. like convenient the kids were constantly out alone to terrorise the dogs every time", "Not out of left field, actually. Snoop decided to change his name a few years ago to Snoop Lion. But I think he changed it back after awhile.", "NTA, as someone with autism, we aren't idiots that can't learn nor behave. If you can't educate your child to respect animals then that's on you and you should keep them away from animals because it could pose a real threat to your child in the future.\n\nPlus, it's your land and dogs, what does it matter to them? Why would having privacy be such an issue to them? For all they know, you could be putting up that fence so that you can skinny dip into a blow up pool!", "NTA. Wtf is wrong with these entitled people (parents I mean)", "Anyone who tries to contest the saying \"good fences make good neighbors\" is just a creep who likes to trample boundaries. They keep assholes out and the friendly ones can just *knock on the front door* like kind folk do. Thoroughly NTA.", "[removed]", "NTA", "Not only are you NTA, but I commend your forbearance in only  shutting the door in her face. I'll bet her kids are unbearable and tormenting your dogs is their entertainment. That's why Mrs Grizzly watches from the window, so nice of your dogs to amuse the little gremlins. It is not your responsibility to look after her offspring, autistic or not. I'm so glad you put up the fence. Sooner or later a dog might get so upset and childrens' fingers might get snapped at. The dog at the end of its tether and terrified, would of course, get the blame. You have prevented this and protected your dogs. I'll bet she's extra mad because she knows you have all the permits, so she can't get you to take the fence down on a technicality. As Robert Frost observed, good fences make good neighbors.", "NTA You can do what you want with your property, her kids disability isn\u2019t your problem, what an entitled woman.  I am so sick of people inflicting  their or their kids disability on others.  I would  also get some fast growing bushes and block those AHs out completely.", "NTA I've seen fences with a small circle cut out so the dog can put their nose or face through at their free will, maybe this could be a compromise, not that you owe one though", "NTA and if one of your dog had bitten her child out of fear she would be screaming to have it put down. You did the right thing to protect both your dogs and those children. That lady can suck an egg. It's a good thing they will never get a dog because letting her kids behave like that around dogs is just begging for a bite to happen.", "NTA. You raised the issue repeatedly and they ignored it. Now the truth comes out; they were deliberately allowing the kids to terrorize your dogs because it entertained the kids and was convenient for the parents. Fuck em.", "You did right by your fur babies. You\u2019re a mama bear too!! NTA", "NTA. Bigger fences make better neighbors.", "NTA.  The neighbour is definitely the one in the wrong, especially since she tried to use her child's autism as an excuse.  I have a child with autism and this is not how you act.  Not to mention, she lets him run around without supervision?  Where dogs are?  You did right by installing a privacy fence.  Now you can't be held liable if the dogs got upset and nipped at them.  (Not saying they would, they sound like sweet lil things)  But this mom sounds a tad unhinged and I wouldn't trust her if she can't watch her own kids and then blames YOU for something she refused to handle for over a year.", "NTA", "NTA at all.", "NTA I feel so bad for any animals the neighbor might get.", "NTA \u201cif you had bothered to teach your children the proper way to interact with dogs I wouldn\u2019t have had to change the fence!

One of these days the kids might have climbed over the fence. Dogs sometimes react badly when badly behaved kids provoke them and then your dogs would have been the ones who got punished. It's not your job or your dogs' job for that matter to entertain those kids. They were harassing your pets and your neighbor let them. Make sure your fence is locked so they can't get in.", "Yeah and I bet if one of your dogs bit her kid she would be on the phone to the lawyers for a pay day in a heartbeat. \n\n\u2018Their dogs\u2019.
