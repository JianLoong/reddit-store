To me she\u2019s like the whole world. Currently I\u2019m with my grandparents because of my moms business trip. We live in an apartment but we have a little house in the hills where they will sometimes go. We used to have to cats and they would constantly bring the kitten up there. On day he just disappeared and we never saw him after that. The cat isn\u2019t the family cat or something it\u2019s 100% mine. My friend got it and I feed her clean her litter box and everything. Now comes the problem I told them that it is ok for them to bring her there with them as long as they don\u2019t loose her. I let her go up there because she needs the fresh air and nature as we live in the city. Yesterday they went up there and when they came back she wasn\u2019t with them. I asked them where she was and they just said they didn\u2019t find her so they left her up there. They did the one thing I asked them not to. They said they waited for 15 minutes, that she didn\u2019t show up and they left. I had a mental break down. There was a really dark time when the only thing keeping me alive was the thought of what would happen to her if I died. She\u2019s the sole reason I\u2019m alive today. I just shut myself in my room and cried. I knew that I couldn\u2019t do anything. In the end they went back up there not to find her but because they forgot their phone. Luckily she was there when they arrived she was sitting on the porch so they took her home as well. I told them that from now on as the cat is mine they won\u2019t be allowed to take her up there because I don\u2019t want anything to happen to her. As I said she means the world to me and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her. I know what I said might\u2019ve been harsh but she means a lot to me and and I don\u2019t want anything to happen to her. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679648345, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120ehkw/aita_for_telling_my_grandparents_that_they_are/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be devastated if someone else lost one of my cats. They were irresponsible and can't be trusted with your cat. They have proven this to be true.", "NTA \n\nWhy in the world are they taking a cat up there anyway? What reason did they have? And why did they think it was ok to abandon the cat after a few minutes of looking?\n\nI am curious though- if you are staying with your grandparents, why were you not with them at the vacation house?\n\nYou learned a valuable lesson- who you can or can\u2019t trust with your pets.", "NTA\n\n A cat in the wild cannot only devastate the natural wildlife but also run into so many problems from bigger predators to traps to eating poison, getting sick, getting hit by a car........ If that is 100% your cat you get the say. Sounds like grandparents don't respect you or your cat", "NTA\n\nOP had set specific rules for your grandparents and OP's grandparents have not followed through. Seems a bit inconsiderate.", "NTA. Cats are territorial. You can't move them around like dogs. All you are doing is dropping them into territory already owned by another feline, maybe a cat, maybe a lynx, etc. They will be stressed out and feel the need to mark out then fight for the area around the house. They are not \"enjoying nature\" To them it feels like they are patrolling enemy territory in a war zone.", "NTA You said your grandparents could take your cat to the hills on the condition that they not loose her. They promised they won't. Then they broke that promise. Yes cats tend to wonder away. But your grandparents only waited 15 minutes. It should have been longer.  I don't think it's too much to tell them not to take your cat again.", "NTA. I have 5 cats and they are all indoor cats. The oldest is 14 and the youngest is 7. Please do not let them take your cat anymore, as you can't trust them. Better to keep your cat indoors, but if you let her out only do it where you live all the time. We have had stray cats run over in our front yard which is why they are indoor cats.", "I don\u2019t see a current conflict here, but protect your pet. NTA.", "NTA. Like at all. They did the one thing you asked them not to do, and it seems like they were pretty careless about it. I do think you should sit down and explain to them how you view your cat though, because they don\u2019t seem to understand that she\u2019s not just a pet, she\u2019s your family. \n\nAlso, just an FYI: you don\u2019t actually need to take your cat up there for fresh air. If they have a stimulating environment at home, that\u2019s all they need to live a happy, thriving, life. Plus, the outdoors can be dangerous\u2014 like my first cat from when I was a teenager contracted FIV (kitty aids) from something outside and I ended up losing him pretty early on.", "Yikes.

For caring about your cat. But they don't need time in the country. If you live in an apartment, you have a house cat. They tend to live longer than ones that run free. Try leash training her for walks.", "Hell no you're nta.  Depending on your location, that cat could've been prey!!  I'd put a collar and an apple tracking tag on her, so you can keep an eye on her.  It might even have settings to let you know if they take her again.", "NTA. So it was OK to abandon living being up there but couldn't leave a damn phone up there?", "They take her there because she loves nature. She can be an indoor cat but she loves the outdoors and loves to hunt which is ok when we are at their house because she\u2019s used to it. I don\u2019t know why they stopped looking Ig they were just tired. They live in another country which is about 4 hours drive away from where we live. The vacation house is more like a place they go to to relax and wind down and I\u2019m not with them because I have final test, high school admissions and school when they\u2019re there. I thought it would be ok to let them take her as she enjoys it and they have taken her up there a few times.

It\u2019s repetitive behavior- they don\u2019t watch the cat, they open a door and let her run free, and then do the bare minimum when it comes to picking her up. \n\nWhat if they aren\u2019t going back there for a month, does the cat just get to fend for herself? \n\nYou\u2019re familiar enough with their repetitive, neglectful behavior. If you don\u2019t want to lose the cat, don\u2019t send the cat with the grandparents who don\u2019t watch the cat.", "If you know they have no care for her, and the cat has already gone missing before in that same place, why did you let them take her *again*? \"Oh, she loves the outdoors,\" many cats do, but that doesn't mean it's good for them.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, but if you want your cat to be outdoors, be prepared for her to die. I say this as a cat owner who has outdoor cats. They will come home hurt or not come home at all, and I need to be prepared for that.", "They live hours away but the vacation house is a 30 ish minute drive and I didn\u2019t think I should say anything since they are my grandparents and now is the point that I snapped", "You are lucky that your cat is still alive. Wild animals and cars aren't the only things who hurt cats. It doesn't matter if they are your grandparents or the Queen of Sheba, they showed no care for your animal, so they don't have the right to take it anywhere.", "YTA for letting them take the cat anywhere. Your cat has a home. Don\u2019t let other people take your cat out of its home. It\u2019s not like it can consent to being taken miles away from its home, where it has no chance of making its way back if it gets lost or say, abandoned.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let them take your cat anymore.", "NTA because it's your cat. But you need to realize that they have already left your cat there several times. Knowing this, if you let it continue and anything happens to your cat it's honestly your fault because you know how they are. I know it's harsh to say that but if it's your cat its your responsibility to make sure she is safe. Allowing her to go with people that don't really care about her well being is not being a good pet owner.", "NTA- and I would just say- look- you guys care more about your phone than the cat. She means the world to me. Please respect how important she is to me and do not risk anything happening to her by taking her there.", "NTA your grandparents are irresponsible jerks. Im so sorry. Is there someone you can talk to? It sounds like your going through a lot.", "I've never heard that cats need fresh air and nature; basically a vacation. Keep her home in the apartment.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour grandparents are irresponsible and abusive AHs.", "NTA but you are very lucky the cat is alive. Do some research and understand the risks of letting a cat roam unsupervised. \n\nCats live very happy indoor only lives when their need for stimulation and exercise are being met by you, their owner.", "NTA", "Gotta downvote here. It's fine to take your cat outside on a lead, with a harness. It's not ok to let it hunt. That's devastating to the native wildlife and ecology.", "I watch a lot of vet shows. I'm shocked by the number of pets hit by cars, bitten by other animals or shot (by arrows or guns) while enjoying nature. Keep your cat indoors.", "That\u2019s kind of the circle of life and that\u2019s just how most of them function. She only hunts sometimes so like 4-5 times per year", "I know you\u2019re young, so I don\u2019t blame you for not knowing any better - but your kitty needs to be an indoor cat, only. Even if you take her with you to the vacation home. Besides the fact that she could get killed by wild life, hit by a car, or even stolen, the fact is that cats are TERRIBLE for nature. When they\u2019re outside they cause havoc, and hurt a lot of native species. So don\u2019t let her out, both for her safety and for the good of the environment.", "Here in my country, we have a lot of outdoor cats, and many times stray/feral cats are adopted but still roam around. Which is the case with mine. If yours is like this, you HAVE to be ready for the consequences. \n\nOP is really putting the cat at risk. If she is able to keep the cat inside, she should.", "I have 4 cats. I've had cats since I was a child. Cats destroy native ecology. They're the #3 cause of species going extinct, after #2 rats and #1 humans.", "It's not. Cat's are an introduced species that kill local wildlife which have no natural defenses against them. Your pet also doesn't need to hunt to eat and doing so puts her at serious risk of injury and death. It also puts her in conflict with abandoned cats who may have serious illnesses and predators. The average outdoor cat lives 2-5 years. An indoor cat lives 12-18. It's not even close which is better."]}
