To me she\u2019s like the whole world. Currently I\u2019m with my grandparents because of my moms business trip. We live in an apartment but we have a little house in the hills where they will sometimes go. We used to have to cats and they would constantly bring the kitten up there. On day he just disappeared and we never saw him after that. The cat isn\u2019t the family cat or something it\u2019s 100% mine. My friend got it and I feed her clean her litter box and everything. Now comes the problem I told them that it is ok for them to bring her there with them as long as they don\u2019t loose her. I let her go up there because she needs the fresh air and nature as we live in the city. Yesterday they went up there and when they came back she wasn\u2019t with them. I asked them where she was and they just said they didn\u2019t find her so they left her up there. They did the one thing I asked them not to. They said they waited for 15 minutes, that she didn\u2019t show up and they left. I had a mental break down. There was a really dark time when the only thing keeping me alive was the thought of what would happen to her if I died. She\u2019s the sole reason I\u2019m alive today. I just shut myself in my room and cried. I knew that I couldn\u2019t do anything. In the end they went back up there not to find her but because they forgot their phone. Luckily she was there when they arrived she was sitting on the porch so they took her home as well. I told them that from now on as the cat is mine they won\u2019t be allowed to take her up there because I don\u2019t want anything to happen to her. As I said she means the world to me and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her. I know what I said might\u2019ve been harsh but she means a lot to me and and I don\u2019t want anything to happen to her. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679648345, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120ehkw/aita_for_telling_my_grandparents_that_they_are/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be devastated if someone else lost one of my cats. They were irresponsible and can't be trusted with your cat. They have proven this to be true.", "NTA \n\nWhy in the world are they taking a cat up there anyway? What reason did they have? And why did they think it was ok to abandon the cat after a few minutes of looking?\n\nI am curious though- if you are staying with your grandparents, why were you not with them at the vacation house?\n\nYou learned a valuable lesson- who you can or can\u2019t trust with your pets.", "NTA\n\n A cat in the wild cannot only devastate the natural wildlife but also run into so many problems from bigger predators to traps to eating poison, getting sick, getting hit by a car........ If that is 100% your cat you get the say. Sounds like grandparents don't respect you or your cat", "NTA\n\nOP had set specific rules for your grandparents and OP's grandparents have not followed through. Seems a bit inconsiderate.", "NTA. Cats are territorial. You can't move them around like dogs. All you are doing is dropping them into territory already owned by another feline, maybe a cat, maybe a lynx, etc. They will be stressed out and feel the need to mark out then fight for the area around the house. They are not \"enjoying nature\" To them it feels like they are patrolling enemy territory in a war zone.", "NTA You said your grandparents could take your cat to the hills on the condition that they not loose her. They promised they won't. Then they broke that promise. Yes cats tend to wonder away. But your grandparents only waited 15 minutes. It should have been longer.  I don't think it's too much to tell them not to take your cat again.", "NTA. I have 5 cats and they are all indoor cats. The oldest is 14 and the youngest is 7. Please do not let them take your cat anymore, as you can't trust them. Better to keep your cat indoors, but if you let her out only do it where you live all the time. We have had stray cats run over in our front yard which is why they are indoor cats.", "I don\u2019t see a current conflict here, but protect your pet. NTA.", "NTA. Like at all. They did the one thing you asked them not to do, and it seems like they were pretty careless about it. I do think you should sit down and explain to them how you view your cat though, because they don\u2019t seem to understand that she\u2019s not just a pet, she\u2019s your family. \n\nAlso, just an FYI: you don\u2019t actually need to take your cat up there for fresh air. If they have a stimulating environment at home, that\u2019s all they need to live a happy, thriving, life. Plus, the outdoors can be dangerous\u2014 like my first cat from when I was a teenager contracted FIV (kitty aids) from something outside and I ended up losing him pretty early on.", "Yikes.

For caring about your cat. But they don't need time in the country. If you live in an apartment, you have a house cat. They tend to live longer than ones that run free. Try leash training her for walks.", "Hell no you're nta.  Depending on your location, that cat could've been prey!!  I'd put a collar and an apple tracking tag on her, so you can keep an eye on her.  It might even have settings to let you know if they take her again.", "NTA. So it was OK to abandon living being up there but couldn't leave a damn phone up there?", "They take her there because she loves nature. She can be an indoor cat but she loves the outdoors and loves to hunt which is ok when we are at their house because she\u2019s used to it. I don\u2019t know why they stopped looking Ig they were just tired. They live in another country which is about 4 hours drive away from where we live. The vacation house is more like a place they go to to relax and wind down and I\u2019m not with them because I have final test, high school admissions and school when they\u2019re there. I thought it would be ok to let them take her as she enjoys it and they have taken her up there a few times.

It\u2019s repetitive behavior- they don\u2019t watch the cat, they open a door and let her run free, and then do the bare minimum when it comes to picking her up. \n\nWhat if they aren\u2019t going back there for a month, does the cat just get to fend for herself? \n\nYou\u2019re familiar enough with their repetitive, neglectful behavior.

I say this as a cat owner who has outdoor cats. They will come home hurt or not come home at all, and I need to be prepared for that.", "They live hours away but the vacation house is a 30 ish minute drive and I didn\u2019t think I should say anything since they are my grandparents and now is the point that I snapped", "You are lucky that your cat is still alive. Wild animals and cars aren't the only things who hurt cats. It doesn't matter if they are your grandparents or the Queen of Sheba, they showed no care for your animal, so they don't have the right to take it anywhere."]}
