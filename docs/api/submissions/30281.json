But you should've sent her a \"seems like you're too busy, I'll get the cake from someone else\" text when you switched plans, for exactly this reason. She didn't communicate but you didn't either!", "NTA. Unless you\u2019ve made a deposit to book the cake there\u2019s no order. It\u2019s a lesson in business for her. From a professional baker", "NTA Because that is a long time to not hear from her, you never gave her the envelope, or gave her a deposit.  However she is a coworker and making an enemy at work could be a problem.  It\u2019s also interesting that it was no big deal for her to accommodate her mistake, by making 2 cakes, but cancelling because of her lack of communication entitles her to 2/3 the cost of the cake?  Bottom line she is very unprofessional with her side cake business.", "Info: did you contact her about this at all during that time? Why didn't you tell her you had decided to go another direction beforehand?", "NTA. If you're running a business, even if it's just a side hustle, you need to communicate effectively.", "NTA\n\nShe put you in a tough spot and forced you to\nmake other arrangements by not responding or being available to receive the envelope. \n\n\nYou owe her nothing. You would only owe a cancellation fee if you cancelled on her knowing all was well and she had made the cake. You had no way of knowing she would randomly make two cakes and not need the envelope.", "NTA. She should have communicated better. I can understand why you got nervous and decided to go with another baker. However ask yourself whether you want to be right or if you want to peace at work. You can\u2019t have both. If you want to keep the peace, consider offering her $20 for the ingredients. \n\nIn the future, avoid doing business with coworkers especially for important things like this. If you want to support a coworker\u2019s baking business, let her do something simple like making a few desserts for a family holiday gathering. There\u2019s no harm done if that gets screwed up and it\u2019s really easy to fix. That\u2019s not the case with something like a gender reveal cake.", "NTA. She screwed up, as evidenced by the fact that she was willing to make two cakes. You wanted to order from her, and it was her action (or inaction) that required you to order somewhere else.\n \nOn principle, she is entitled to nothing. If you *want*, it may be smart to play politics and give her $20 for the supplies (an established baker didn't spend $40 on a $60 cake, and most ingredients will be used at a later date). It would be entirely charity on your part and an effort to not have an enemy at work.", "NTA. She didnt make the cakes so there is nothing lost on her end. That is bad business when she is commissioned to do something and doesn't follow up on her end of the deal. \n\nShe doesnt deserve a dime.", "Wanted to add i case there is confusion that she did end up making two cakes* and that\u2019s why she wants a cancellation fee", "YTA for having a gender reveal. They\u2019re vulgar as hell.", "YTA for doing a gender reveal thing and also for stiffing a co worker. Not smart to do that to someone you work with!

Unless she had a contract with you that specifically states a $40 cancellation fee, that you signed, and she didn't drop the ball on getting the gender, then she hasn't a leg to stand on. Even if you had a signed contract, her inability to communicate effectively with you would have voided the contract. She failed to respond to you, so you went elsewhere. You had no way of knowing that she was baking two cakes for you, and honestly why would anyone do that rather than just contact you and ask you which cake to make. Her amateur baking business   won't be around long if this is how she treats people.", "NTA. Her lack of professionalism is NOT your problem.\n\nEven if this is a side hustle, she is responsible for professional business practices and part of that is communication.", "How odd? Why would someone bake 2 cakes and then give you the right one? LOL LOLNTA", "NTA. She was not acting like a business so don't treat her like she was. You will never get another cake from her, but that is okay.", "That's what a non refundable deposit is for.", "NTA. She never confirmed the arrangement and you have no obligation to her.", "Good point. I hadn't thought of that.", "But that is not something you requested and that was a direct result of her lack of professionalism. \n\nOP, for the future, do not do business with co-workers. It sullies the relationship when issues like this occur.", "You can't stiff someone who doesn't fulfill their part of a transaction. The coworker agreed to make the cake but went no contact for over week without the information she needed _to_ make the cake.\n\nThe date was closing in and OP went elsewhere after being ghosted. How was she supposed to know the coworker would randomly announce that she made 2 cakes?", "What is wrong with doing a gender reveal?", "If you have to pay $40, just have her make the original cake without the dye, slice it up and freeze the slices for later. You might as well get something for your money.", "For some people, they are considered a tacky gift-grab.", "Narcissistic and unnecessary"]}
