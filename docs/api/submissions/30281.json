But you should've sent her a \"seems like you're too busy, I'll get the cake from someone else\" text when you switched plans, for exactly this reason. She didn't communicate but you didn't either!", "NTA. Unless you\u2019ve made a deposit to book the cake there\u2019s no order. It\u2019s a lesson in business for her. From a professional baker", "NTA Because that is a long time to not hear from her, you never gave her the envelope, or gave her a deposit.  However she is a coworker and making an enemy at work could be a problem.  It\u2019s also interesting that it was no big deal for her to accommodate her mistake, by making 2 cakes, but cancelling because of her lack of communication entitles her to 2/3 the cost of the cake?  Bottom line she is very unprofessional with her side cake business.", "Info: did you contact her about this at all during that time? Why didn't you tell her you had decided to go another direction beforehand?", "NTA. If you're running a business, even if it's just a side hustle, you need to communicate effectively.", "NTA\n\nShe put you in a tough spot and forced you to\nmake other arrangements by not responding or being available to receive the envelope. \n\n\nYou owe her nothing. You would only owe a cancellation fee if you cancelled on her knowing all was well and she had made the cake. You had no way of knowing she would randomly make two cakes and not need the envelope.", "NTA. She should have communicated better. I can understand why you got nervous and decided to go with another baker. However ask yourself whether you want to be right or if you want to peace at work. You can\u2019t have both. If you want to keep the peace, consider offering her $20 for the ingredients. \n\nIn the future, avoid doing business with coworkers especially for important things like this. If you want to support a coworker\u2019s baking business, let her do something simple like making a few desserts for a family holiday gathering. There\u2019s no harm done if that gets screwed up and it\u2019s really easy to fix. That\u2019s not the case with something like a gender reveal cake.", "NTA. She screwed up, as evidenced by the fact that she was willing to make two cakes. You wanted to order from her, and it was her action (or inaction) that required you to order somewhere else.\n \nOn principle, she is entitled to nothing. If you *want*, it may be smart to play politics and give her $20 for the supplies (an established baker didn't spend $40 on a $60 cake, and most ingredients will be used at a later date). It would be entirely charity on your part and an effort to not have an enemy at work.", "NTA. She didnt make the cakes so there is nothing lost on her end. That is bad business when she is commissioned to do something and doesn't follow up on her end of the deal. \n\nShe doesnt deserve a dime.", "Wanted to add i case there is confusion that she did end up making two cakes* and that\u2019s why she wants a cancellation fee", "YTA for having a gender reveal.

Unless she had a contract with you that specifically states a $40 cancellation fee, that you signed, and she didn't drop the ball on getting the gender, then she hasn't a leg to stand on. Even if you had a signed contract, her inability to communicate effectively with you would have voided the contract. She failed to respond to you, so you went elsewhere. You had no way of knowing that she was baking two cakes for you, and honestly why would anyone do that rather than just contact you and ask you which cake to make. Her amateur baking business   won't be around long if this is how she treats people.", "NTA. Her lack of professionalism is NOT your problem.\n\nEven if this is a side hustle, she is responsible for professional business practices and part of that is communication.", "How odd? Why would someone bake 2 cakes and then give you the right one? LOL LOLNTA", "NTA. She was not acting like a business so don't treat her like she was. You will never get another cake from her, but that is okay.", "That's what a non refundable deposit is for.", "NTA. She never confirmed the arrangement and you have no obligation to her.", "Good point. I hadn't thought of that.", "But that is not something you requested and that was a direct result of her lack of professionalism. \n\nOP, for the future, do not do business with co-workers. It sullies the relationship when issues like this occur.", "You can't stiff someone who doesn't fulfill their part of a transaction. The coworker agreed to make the cake but went no contact for over week without the information she needed _to_ make the cake.\n\nThe date was closing in and OP went elsewhere after being ghosted. How was she supposed to know the coworker would randomly announce that she made 2 cakes?", "What is wrong with doing a gender reveal?", "If you have to pay $40, just have her make the original cake without the dye, slice it up and freeze the slices for later. You might as well get something for your money.", "For some people, they are considered a tacky gift-grab.", "Narcissistic and unnecessary", "Why did you not contact your coworker to ask what's up or say that you're changing the plan?", "YTA, why not talk to her instead of going to another baker? Sounds like YOU have a communication problem", "INFO: You say she didn\u2019t try to contact you, did you try to contact her at any point? You say she didn\u2019t confirm, but everything you\u2019ve described sounds pretty definite to me. It\u2019s not like this is a random business who could a ghosted you, you knew you would see this coworker again.", "NTA but you should have communicated with her that you had switched to another vendor due to lack of communication on her part.", "ESH but I'll have to say although mildly.\n\nJust how closely did you work with her if it was more than a week since you last spoke to her about the cake.\n\nShe was remiss in not getting the envelope but to counter this she baked two cakes... one with the correct gender, the other without.\n\nYou didn't communicate that you were going with another baker right at the end of the week when you needed it.\n\nI would have imagined that she would be easily contactable to follow up with and at least let her know that you would be going with someone else or confirming what was happening at least - then you would've known about the two cakes.\n\nRealistically, you have to work with her so you'll have to do the smart thing.  She's made the cake in good faith and although she dropped the ball with her lack of communication.. you didn't really help the situation by not communicating either.\n\nI'd probably just pay the money for the cake $60 and get one.  There's no point paying $40 for nothing and she'll likely freeze it and sell it to someone else in the future (which she has every right to do).\n\nThis is going to leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth.   Don't do business with friends and family because when there is a hiccup, it's worse.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re the kind of person who hits a parked car and doesn\u2019t leave a note because there weren\u2019t witnesses.\n\nYou hired a coworker to make you a cake when you know she\u2019s just a hobby baker. You didn\u2019t properly communicate about the cake and, without communicating that you didn\u2019t want her to make the cake anymore, you just found someone else. \n\nYou should have at least texted her to ask about the cake before finding someone else and you should pay for the cancellation fee because she did buy supplies and now doesn\u2019t need them. It sounds like you got cold feet about having this hobbyist make the cake but didn\u2019t respect her enough to be straight up with her. Very passive aggressive.\n\nGood job ruining a work relationship, btw.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou would have needed to INFORM her you were changing plans. So pay her.", "YTA for the \"gender reveal\" bullshit. Nobody cares if your baby has a winky or not.", "ESH, this wasn\u2019t a bakery, it\u2019s a coworker. You should\u2019ve been communicating as well, and you refused.", "NTA - classic case of person who has a skill thinks they can run their own business.\n\nIf she wants to sell cakes she needs to learn how to run a business", "She was a coworker and you spoke in some detail about the cake so why didn't you just give her the envelope with the gender reveal, tell her verbally, or even text her the baby's gender?  OP YTA. Pay the fee!", "ESH. \n\nDoes anyone else hate the entire concept of a gender reveal? Even the woman who first started the whole fad is sorry she ever did. \n\nI vote that we change the gender reveal to \u201cthe birth\u201d.", "Are you having a baby shower? Can you ask her to use the supplies for that instead?", "NTA.

I can\u2019t believe all this NTA votes but I guess this is a subreddit for a petty people who don\u2019t like communicating. \n\nIt\u2019s like OP wanted to assume the coworker wasn\u2019t going to make the cake properly so she created a situation in which the coworker couldn\u2019t make the cake properly.", "It\u2019s on the person making the cake to communicate. And they did not", "Just pay her the cancellation fee or get ready to be TA at work.", "She wasted her own time and ingredient\u2019s making two cakes that\u2019s not your problem", "The problem is that she's made the cakes with the ingredients already and they can't be repurposed for something else.", "You don\u2019t know anything about contracts.", "The person making the cakes wasn\u2019t communicating", "You can keep responding to my comments with that. It doesn\u2019t change my opinion or make what you\u2019re saying true.", "Well, no.", "It said \"she was going to make 2 cakes\" so I don't think she did.

Seems like coworker wants $40 for not baking the cake though. Which is bonkers, those supplies are not wasted, some could probably be returned. Is she going to give OP the supplies that were purchased for that money?\n\nAnd she was prepared to make 2 cakes for $60, there is no way supplies for 1 cake should cost more than half that.\n\nThe smart thing to do is to try to come to a reasonable agreement as noted, so there is no friction at work - however it is at least as much the coworkers mistake and they need to be prepared to meet OP half way. Paying $40 for her mistake with nothing in return is not a tenable solution.\n\nMaybe there is an upcoming birthday or other event OP needs a cake for, that the supplies could be repurposed for?", "Care to elaborate?", "For a transaction like making a cake, an oral contract is fine. \n\nSilence doesn\u2019t void a contract.
