It\u2019s also interesting that it was no big deal for her to accommodate her mistake, by making 2 cakes, but cancelling because of her lack of communication entitles her to 2/3 the cost of the cake?

Why didn't you tell her you had decided to go another direction beforehand?", "NTA. If you're running a business, even if it's just a side hustle, you need to communicate effectively.", "NTA\n\nShe put you in a tough spot and forced you to\nmake other arrangements by not responding or being available to receive the envelope. \n\n\nYou owe her nothing.

If you *want*, it may be smart to play politics and give her $20 for the supplies (an established baker didn't spend $40 on a $60 cake, and most ingredients will be used at a later date).

(And in future, co worker/baker should ask for half, up front.)  \n\n\nOr: Just pay for the cake and bring it to the party too, OP.\n\nGuests might eat both! (One cake by co worker and one by the other baker.)", "Bizarre to not send even one additional text in-between the original text and taking the time to place another order elsewhere: \u201chey, just checking to make sure you saw my question about the envelope\u201d.", "Agreed. I can completely see both sides and I think a simple \"I haven't heard from you so I have just bought a cake. I hope there's nothing wrong as a reason you didn't reply!\" would have made everything easier for everyone involved.", ">OP does not know the gender; the doctor/midwife/technician/ymmv put the result in an envelope, which OP was planning to pass along to a bakery, so that when they cut into the cake they get the same surprise as everyone else. Until the cake is cut (or balloon is popped, or whatever) the only people who know are the medical staff and the person making the gender reveal thing.\n\nOP left a lot out of the original post.\n\nI got stuff to do. Lol", "Maybe she missed that text, is there any reason OP could not have simply told her the gender at some point in time?\n\nBaker waited and did not want to harass a pregnant lady (I assume this is OP's baby, they never actually said in OP who it's for), so baked two cakes, to fulfill the commitment. \n\nOP isn't even grateful? They made sure OP was covered. OP should change the post btw because it only said \"supplies.\" Minimizing it. But later OP said two cakes.", ">Since she never was told a gender\n\nCompletely on the baker.\n\nKinda rude OP didn't say \"I'm canceling\" but since baker never responded to previous message I can't call then an ass for it.", "I never said silence voids a contract, nor did I say that you can't have an oral contract. Try again. And yes, you absolutely shouldn't give legal advice when you haven't a clue. I have decades of experience with contracts as a professional artist. How much experience do you have?", "The people who are saying NTA I wonder if they realize, had OP shown up last minute and demanded a cake and the co worker had not baked one? The co worker could be blamed, and also vilified at work.\n\nThey did have an agreement and due to OP's silence the baker bought twice as many ingredients and baked two whole cakes (OP later said in a comment -- it's not in the OP post.)\n\nJust so despite being rude about not communicating, OP would have a cake either way. And for that OP ghosted and refused to pay the baker.\n\nI can't believe all these NTA, I am with you.", ">So the parents are screaming and reacting because they are so suprised by the other people's reaction? That is a wierd way to perceive those videos. In every reveal video   \n>  \n>I'VE  \n>  \n> seen the parents don't know.\n\nOkay congrats? Why down vote me for seeing different gender reveal videos.\n\n\ud83d\ude02", ">I\u2019ve been busy and preoccupied with my own problems.\n\nTo me, she sensed this and did not want to press or be pushy with questions, so she laid back and waited and then just baked 2 so you were covered.  \n\n\nCancel fee is standard, I'd say at least offer something, or buy it from her and have two, if you can. It worked out bad for both of you but both could've been more assertive with communication.\n\nIf she answered everything but that one text, my bet is she missed it for whatever reason. If that is the case, she must have thought you had your 'hands full' and chose not to bother you. \n\nI'm sure in future she will ask for half up front as deposit.", ">I'm guessing the baker did not see that text, and waited for the info, then gave up and baked two cakes, which OP confirmed: she did bake 2 cakes.\n\nEntirely the bakers fault, you can't, as the person proving the service, miss a message from the person paying you and go \"woops my bad\". \n\nBecause she knew the baker didn't receive the important info she went with someone else. Probably should have told baker but baker didn't read previous message so whatever.", "\"I didn't get a reply for my Last message, when can we meet up so I can give you the envelope?\"\n\nOr better yet, just CALL HER", "If she was waiting for a reply she would have seen the text from Op that said hey come get this info. text messages don't just magically disappear if you don't see them when you first get them. You seem to want to make ops the villain by saying maybe she's shopping around for a cheaper cake wtf", "Apologies, thanks for clarifying!.\n\nWhilst that sucks for the cake maker though, it still doesn't change the fact that she didn't do her due diligence on this. Why didn't she contact the OP to ask for the envelope before she made 2 cakes?!. They are coworkers so clearly don't live miles from each other \n\nShe was never asked to make 2 and only did so because she'd messed up, but is now charging for the 2nd cake that was never wanted even if things had gone right?!. That's still on her, and she needs to take the loss and be more professional next time.", "No, they didn't leave anything out, it is just pretty damn obvious if you think about the mechanics of keeping the babies sex a secret from everyone instead of latching on to your own assumption and running with it.", "Uh, that shouldn't really be necessary to put in the post. It's standard practice for a gender reveal cake.", ">is there any reason OP could not have simply told her the gender at some point in time?\n\nI think you miss the point of a gender reveal cake, OP doesn't know the gender but has it in a sealed envelope so whoever makes the cake knows.\n\nIt is also unclear whether the baker planned to make two cakes or already did but that's still on the baker and not on OP.\n\nWhy should she be grateful when she ordered a cake and the baker didn't communicate with her at all? That panic of \"will I have a cake in time\" is worse than your proposed \"didn't wanna harass a pregnant lady\".", "I\u2019m a lawyer.", "How was the OP silent? They sent the last communication.", "You didn't see different ones you misinterpreted and treated it as fact.\n\nEdit: was blocked. Response.\n\nAngry? When was I angry? We can't find a conclusion between 2 people I suppose, but I'd wager the *vast majority* of gender reveals the parents don't know.", "It's still on her if she missed the text and in case you didn't know text are still there after you go back if you miss them unless you deleted them so there is no reason that she wouldn't have known the Opie tried to get her the envelope", ">Because she knew the baker didn't receive the important info\n\nIt was not ever sent. They just asked when they would like to know.\n\nIt's OK if they went with someone else, but a cancel fee is standard.\n\nPart of this is because this is not a pro situation, but probably that's why they asked a friend or co worker -- to get a cheaper deal on a cake. But that comes with some rough edges, such as, they might not know to get half payment up front, or make people sign a written contract.\n\nReally they both should've been more assertive with communication. The friend might not have wanted to sound pushy. The OP could've simply made sure the info was sent, which gender, on time.\n\nIf the OP does refuse to pay, it's not really enforceable. Small claims won't pursue non payment even if ruled in the baker's favor. The baker learned a hard lesson. Either don't do favors or make sure they're protected.", "In another comment I said I would've sent a follow up message because that's what you do when someone doesn't answer you, it's a bit weird that OP just left it there.\n\nStill, I hate people that do this. They never answer their phone, disappear for days, then pop up out of the blue and say \"Look what I did!\" Thanks but no thanks \ud83d\ude4f", ">Apologies, thanks for clarifying!.\n\nYou're welcome and thanks for your polite reply.\n\nOP is giving more details in comments. She said she didn't see the co worker that week. She said the co worker replied to all other texts.\n\nThat underscored my original hunch that the co worker never saw the question about the envelope (or maybe didn't understand what was meant. I didn't.)\n\nSince the co worker answered all other texts, my hunch is she didn't see the one about the envelope. But I think OP should've made sure the baker had that info. Also should've told the baker asap that she went with someone else.\n\nLast communication they had, the deal was on.\n\nOP also said she's been having a hard time. That underscored my hunch again: that the baker didn't want to pressure her (for info), so she just baked 2 cakes.\n\nBoth should've been more assertive with communication. The baker will be reluctant to do a favor for anyone in future, without protecting themselves, with half down deposit and or a written contract.\n\nOh btw, no the baker is not charging for 2 cakes. She did not know to bake pink or blue so she said they could just take the right one when they picked it up. She baked both. But only charged for one (if taken.)\n\nWith it canceled, she's not asking for even one cake fee, but just a partial fee for canceling.", "OP also said that she herself does not know the gender. \n\nSo in that case it's possible the baker did not know who to ask.  \n\n\nAssuming again she missed the text about 'the envelope.' Or maybe didn't understand it.   \n\n\nSounds complicated.", ">I\u2019m a lawyer.\n\nThis is good to hear. \n\nDo you think the OP should've made sure the baker had the info, whether or not the baker replied about 'an envelope?' \n\nDo you think the baker should've asked for half up front?\n\nDo you think the cancel fee is a fair amount?", "You are absolutely not a lawyer.", "Some people take this stuff way too seriously -- you are actually this angry because of -- what -- not even sure. You have different experiences?\n\n\\> you misinterpreted\n\nYou do not even know *what* I saw -- and this has nothing to do with this sub or this OP post. \n\nPeople online will literally make up stuff to argue about.", ">The OP could've simply made sure the info was sent, which gender, on time.\n\nThe OP offered the info to give to the baker, the info is physical so she needs baker to respond in order to hand it over, baker never responds OP goes with another baker.", "OP basically said: \"When are you available to receive the important info?\" and got no response.", "You were sitting here defending the baker saying she didn't get the info op tried to give her the info! The baker refused to answer so they could actually get the info, what do you not understand", "Sure, bud.", "Yeah, if I was a wrong as you are, I'd probably respond the same way.", "It\u2019s not a way to tell someone to lighten up. I also don\u2019t need you telling me to lighten up. Tell your boss to get the pinecone out of his ass and see how he responds.\n\nYour comment got removed for a reason. You clearly cannot communicate like a rational adult so it\u2019s hilarious that you\u2019re giving advice about communication.", "Again have a great Saturday"]}
