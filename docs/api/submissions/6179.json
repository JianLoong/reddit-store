I can't call anyone an AH. Your father just died, you're mourning. You both are. Your sister is stressed about her wedding and focused on that. You have your own way of grieving. It seems like people don't take your tradition seriously, but tradition is meaningful to people. If it has meaning to you, and it matters to you, of course you have to do what you feel is right. Maybe you overstepped asking your sister to change the wedding date, but it was only a suggestion and I understand *why*. A wedding so close to a funeral? But her refusal makes sense. She's waited long enough and has a lot of money staked in this, I'm sure. And brides have their own vision for their day. I can't blame her for wanting what she wanted, but I can't blame your refusal, because it has meaning to you. \n\nI don't think either of you owes either an apology. You were both in an emotionally charged time and each doing what you thought was right, but neither of you was wrong. I think it's silly of her to hold a grudge over this, but maybe you can talk it out. Tell her what the tradition means to you and how sad you were (and I imagine still are.) She lost her father, too, I'm sure she can understand, even if she's upset she didn't get what she wanted from you. I hope you can both understand how different you are and come to respect one another's differences. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.", "NAH\nBoth of you are (were ) not wrong.", "I'll go against the grain here, and say NTA.

But I don't live in USA, so I guess the social rules are probably different.", "NTA!!! Three weeks after losing her father and your sister is going through with a wedding? Wtf is wrong with her? Even compromising with wearing purple is a huge step from your side. I am sorry for your loss at least you have some respect for your father and his memory.", "Soft YTA - it\u2019s understandable she didn\u2019t want to change the wedding date, nor want you there wearing black - you walking down the aisle in black would change the event to focus on your father instead of being a celebration of the couple\u2019s love. And you weren\u2019t wrong in stepping down as a bridesmaid. But the way that it went down and the judgement about how others are grieving or acting pushes you into YTA territory. \n\nYou won\u2019t always agree with your family\u2019s actions, but if you love them you\u2019ll still support them when they need it.", "YTA for refusing to celebrate her marriage the way she and her husband want to celebrate.\n\nYou're notTA for grieving. You're notTA for stepping down from your role.\n\nYou areTA again for expecting your sister to apologise to you for not grieving how you want her to grieve.", "YTA. I would have said no AH if you simply chose to step down from being a bridesmaid because you wanted to continue to wear black. But it sounds like you created a lot of drama at a time when your family needed less of that. Your sister owes you no apology for asking you to step down if you refused to wear the chosen colors - wearing black as a bridesmaid when everyone else was wearing yellow would have focused all attention on you and on the tragedy. You fought with your sister, trying to make her reschedule her wedding and creating drama over the dress, so you owe her an apology. Lastly, people keep asking about the dress color - I think maybe your sister offered a compromise of allowing you to wear a purple dress while everyone else wore yellow and despite that being a traditional color of mourning in a number of cultures, you also refused that option. You have not answered any questions about this, so I think you are trying to hide that she was being as reasonable and flexible as she could be.  All that said, I am very sorry for your loss and I assume your grief was a major reason why you were not thinking clearly.", "NAH, 2 weeks after losing a parent is no time for anyone to be upset you are still grieving.

Honestly be ashamed of yourself for telling someone to get over themselves simply because they are grieving.\nIf anyone should get over themselves its you, thinking you can decide how people should grieve. Just yuck.", "You can't decide whether someone's tradition is wrong or not. If their family still wears black, good for them and you're the asshole for dismissing that like it means nothing.\n\nAlso funny seeing all the delusional comments from people who clearly haven't lost a parent or know what real grief is.", "Plus she starts off by calling her sister the spontaneous one because she planned her wedding only 6 months ahead.  That sounded like a put down to me.\n\nSpontaneous would be running down to City Hall 3 days later.", "But don't be surprised when you're not welcome at the wedding if you choose to wear black.", "True, but in this situation she said her sister requested purple, but said if she wasn\u2019t wearing yellow she couldn\u2019t walk down the aisle. It\u2019s just an inconsistent story.", "But she won\u2019t even wear purple\u2026 it\u2019s not like OP is trying to compromise. It seems like she doesn\u2019t want to wear anything other than black.", "Cheers. Never heard that before", "And now her sister is trying to ruin it even more.", "If the issue was her grief I would agree but she\u2019s only bucking at the performative portion and unwilling to wear a different color. She doesn\u2019t say that she\u2019d be too sad or can\u2019t function just that it\u2019s \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to the father.", "Yeah all that's great except for the part where you aren't going to the wedding, OP went to the wedding and clearly isn't struggling like you. Your situation has nothing to do with this.", "I have lost a parent and two siblings, does my opinion count enough for you.\n\nI too think OP is the arsehole.", "I've lost a parent, and OP is still the asshole. She can wear black all she wants, she just can't demand that her sister keep her as a bridesmaid if she's going to wear black to the wedding, and she *definitely* can't demand her sister reschedule her wedding at the last minute.", "Of course you can have an option about someone's tradition. Wearing black is pretty harmless, but there are plenty traditions that need to be abandoned. Traditions also change over time. \n\nAccording to traditions, the women in Iran bed to wear hijabs. In Afghanistan wonen cannot even go to school anymore. In parts of Africa and Asia girls are getting female circumcisions. \n\nLooking back at (my) local traditions; 100 years ago, wonen couldn't vote. 15 years ago, we had 'black Pete' and while there was no racist intent, the resemblance with blackface (KKK) murderers gave a lot of grievances. Traditions change, public opinions change.", "My dad died when I was 21. Over a decade later and I still cry about it. And I think you and OP are AHs.", "Absolutely, you make your choice.", "Yes, I'm trying to work that one out as well", "I figured that purple was the compromise the sister was trying to make until OP refused so sister was like \u201cwell if you refuse that, then you can either dress like the rest of the bridesmaids or you can just not be in the wedding party\u201d", "I agree. Just explaining the use of purple. \n\nFrankly, everyone grieves differently, and it sounds as if OP shouldn\u2019t even attend the wedding if a celebration hurts her that much. She may be far more emotionally affected by the loss than the sister is. Sister was also a mighty big B about it. I think they both owe each other apologies for being insensitive to each other\u2019s feelings.", "And the sister can\u2019t demand that OP stops grieving the way they want to grieve\u2026", "Stop trying to tell OP how to grieve\u2026 Ain\u2019t nobody gonna tell you to \u201csuck it up\u201d when you lose a parental figure\u2026", "I agree that they should both talk about their feelings, but I do think this falls more on OP.\n\nIf OP didn\u2019t want to celebrate, she should have just told her sister she didn\u2019t feel comfortable going to the wedding, rather than telling her what to do. People can grieve however they like for as long as they like, but they cannot dictate other people\u2019s lives.\n\nI don\u2019t think the sister handled the situation the best, but if someone told me to cancel my wedding right after after my father died, I would get upset too."]}
