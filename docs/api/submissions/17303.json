My wife and her friend planned a trip to the beach for four days which fell on Mothers Day. So I thought to myself that since I\u2019m watching the kids while she\u2019s gone that would count as a gift since she wouldn\u2019t be here to celebrate that day and would get home that night on Mother\u2019s Day. She gets home and realizes that I didn\u2019t do anything for her and later tells me that she is upset and message was received loud and clear. I tried to explain my reasoning and thought process but she didn\u2019t agree.\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's also a day to celebrate her, so how would she be an AH for scheduling a trip around Mother's Day? She's the mother. The day isn't to celebrate the kids or dad. If anything, the focus should be on the mom and she should still be recognized for being a mother regardless of her 4 day trip.\n\n Watching your own kids and calling it a \"gift\" for your wife for Mother's Day shows how out if touch and selfish this man is.

He thinks watching his own kids is a favor to her, meaning he thinks it's really her responsibility and he's just covering for her. I believe he was annoyed that mom got to have fun while he was stuck home with the kids and this is actually punishment for the mom.\n\n \" I'm not going to celebrate you because you got to go on a trip and I'm stuck home doing your job, I'm helping you out.\" His reasoning is based on his frustration to have to \"do her job\" and watch the kids.. he thinks he's doing HER favor by watching his own kids. If you really think the mom is an AH on this case you may just as bad as the father. \n\n He wanted to hurt her. Narcissists often behave like this. They use birthdays and celebrations to minimize the person by refusing to bring attention or acknowledge the other persons happiness or achievements. It's common they start fights on others big days too. Their behavior is manipulative and it's done on purpose, it's not that he simply thought the child care was a gift, he's  punishing her for leaving him to watch the kids while she's having fun. He didn't want her to be celebrated because HE'S watching the kids for 4 days, which is a Mother's job. She most likely watches them all the time so her 4 day trip trumped the other days she's with the kids and she didn't actually deserve to be celebrated with a gift or dinner. That's the thought process.\n\n He could've simply bought her a card and candy, instead he did nothing. How do you do nothing for your wife who has been a mother to your children for years?

She still managed to get gifts for everyone. She did EVERYTHING around the house and in the family. Had a concert? She was there. Had an exhibit? She was there. Had a meeting with a teacher? She was there. Even after she got a full time job she was there.\n\nThe funny thing about parents is you can normally tell who want to be a parent and who doesn't.
