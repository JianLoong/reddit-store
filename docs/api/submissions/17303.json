My wife and her friend planned a trip to the beach for four days which fell on Mothers Day. So I thought to myself that since I\u2019m watching the kids while she\u2019s gone that would count as a gift since she wouldn\u2019t be here to celebrate that day and would get home that night on Mother\u2019s Day. She gets home and realizes that I didn\u2019t do anything for her and later tells me that she is upset and message was received loud and clear. I tried to explain my reasoning and thought process but she didn\u2019t agree.\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sounds like she\u2019s more than earned 4 days off.", "I disagree, if I'm on vacation without family that is a gift from my SO and i will absolutely let her know how appreciative I am. Instead of splitting everything for 4 days they're doing everything. \n\nShe wasn't on a work trip or dealing with a family crisis or in the hospital which yeah suck it up and be the parent. She should get that time because it'd important that doesn't mean it's not a gift. \n\nIn my house we pretty much split all chores if I did them all for 4 days that would be a gift to my wife not me being an adult.", "Is it really that hard to get a card or flowers or hey better yet you have the kids make something with them for her like doing a craft for her so she has a memory of this Mother\u2019s Day.", "Well your reasoning is wrong mate lol", "No way man, not if you're getting away for a whole day nearly every week.", "How often is your eldest sick and needs to be picked up from school? That doesn't seem like a good responsibility indicator.", "That\u2019s your takeaway?  Cool.", "Theyre your kids. Taking care of them isnt a gift, its the bare minimum", "So does she not give you anything for Father\u2019s Day the years you take vacations away from the kids?", "that\u2019s goofy then.

Spending time with your own fucking kids shouldn't be a fucking \"gift\".", "Watching your own children no matter the situation will always be parenting not a gift.

That means there's a whole day usually weekly she's on her own. \n\nIf you add that time up I bet it more than equal 4 damn days", "You\u2019ll get a lot of people who don\u2019t understand that the gift was you doing her share of parenting as well as your own for the whole time she was away. Still, I would have gotten her a card or some flowers too, but I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH if you don\u2019t.", "So you don\u2019t ever go away from home alone? Or only on Father\u2019s Day?", "What?! All the overwhelming comments telling you isn\u2019t enough?", "Does he realize that divorced dads have to do this 24/7 on their visitation time? Cuz that is where he is headed.", "Unfortunately, you don't get to decide what she's ok with. \n\nYou can't automatically assume that something you would be ok with...... That she will be ok with. \n\nCommunication is extremely important here.\n\nFor example...... I absolutely hate greeting cards. Can't stand them and the waste of money they are. My wife loves them. I still buy her a greeting card as she loves them, but tell her to not buy them for me. I can't assume that she'll be ok with me not getting her a card because I hate them", "Okay but she isn't. YTA and the fact that you did not help the kids get her a present or even make a card is what sells it for me. If that had of happened it'd probably be the opposite but yoh dropped the ball.", "Ok so to get this right \nThere are days throughout the year where you are gone doing fun stuff and she watches the kids, but she still gets you father's day presents, birthday presents etc \n\nYou return that favour over 4 days but decide that counts as a gift because 'you would be ok with it' despite years of watching your wife do both for you? \n\nSometimes it's worth thinking outside your own head for like 3 seconds. People tend to treat their loved ones how they want to be treated. She clearly isn't seeing taking care of kids as a 'gift' otherwise you would have not received gifts for these various occasions. Therefore you can safely assume she wouldn't see it as a gift from you. \n\nFucking explaining that to an adult is depressing.", "Sure, if she was on a work trip, but SOLO parenting while in a relationship is a gift. If I piss off for 4 days with friends I'm damn well going to consider it a gift from my wife. If I do it over fathers day it would certainly be a Father's day weekend trip. Its way better than a bunch of flowers. Yeah I'd be bummed if I came home on Father's day to not so much as a card but I would still consider the 4 days as a gift.", "Doing your half of the parenting duties is the bare minimum. Taking over the other person's half in addition to yours so they can go on a trip with friends is beyond that.", "and how often does that happen?", "OK, so her watching the kids so you can play paintball counts as your next birthday gift, right? And the weekend after that will count as your Father's day gift, the one after that is your Christmas gift....\n\nHow many days does she watch the kids so you can play paintball a year, vs how many days do you watch the kids for her to go out with her friends?", "Do you hear yourself?  Seriously?  Don\u2019t be surprised when she leaves you because at this point you\u2019ve proven she doesn\u2019t need you to parent.", "Oh.\n\nOH.\n\nYeah, bro, you're gonna find yourself divorced if you keep going down this behavior path.", "It stopped sounding real when he was talking another going pro with paintball", "Still ignoring what happened with your wife, I see. I hope she finds someone who treats her better", "It\u2019s not about the gifts to her it\u2019s about her feeling appreciated and you doing your job parenting is not appreciating her it\u2019s doing the bare minimum.", "Ok so I take issue with this\u2026. You don\u2019t expect gifts, therefore you don\u2019t do gifts for your wife? I think you both should have a talk about expectations in the gift giving/special days arena.

I'm guessing so. Should your husbamd do that more often? Yes!", "I'm glad you're satisfied with your partner doing her job and parenting your children while you're away, but that doesn't mean everyone has to or that it's a \"gift.\" \n\nThat's what it means to be a parent. You take care of your kids. And if parent A is unable to watch the kids, it should be expected of parent B to watch them.", "See he should've done that but that doesn't mean giving his wife a 4 day trip with friends over mother's day isn't a gift. I would prefer that to whatever I'm going to get on Father's day lol.

Doesn\u2019t work like that.", "I do no believe he does realize that. \n\nI bet in a year or so his AITA eill be \"AITA for not taking my kids during scheduled visitation because I have to take care of them for 2 whole days every x number of weekends \"\n\nOr something like that", "\nMy husband is going on a bachelor party during father's day weekend and I told him I'd have the kids bake a cheesecake or something with me, make a good dinner, and clean the house, plus I plan on having a small gift the kids pick out ready for him to open when he gets home Sunday afternoon. It's not much, but it's *something*. (I was already planning on doing this but he was going to play computer games all day instead of be with the boys.)", "Nope. Still not a gift.", "I would probably consider the trip and 4 days completely free of any household and parenting duties as my gift as well. That\u2019s a lot of work to do-I know because I do it all the time when my husband is gone for work.  Not everyone has the opportunity to pay for the trip and also be free of parenting duties (I don\u2019t) so I\u2019d be extremely appreciative of the chance to do it.
