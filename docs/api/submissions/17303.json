My wife and her friend planned a trip to the beach for four days which fell on Mothers Day. So I thought to myself that since I\u2019m watching the kids while she\u2019s gone that would count as a gift since she wouldn\u2019t be here to celebrate that day and would get home that night on Mother\u2019s Day. She gets home and realizes that I didn\u2019t do anything for her and later tells me that she is upset and message was received loud and clear. I tried to explain my reasoning and thought process but she didn\u2019t agree.\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If anything, the focus should be on the mom and she should still be recognized for being a mother regardless of her 4 day trip.\n\n Watching your own kids and calling it a \"gift\" for your wife for Mother's Day shows how out if touch and selfish this man is.

He thinks watching his own kids is a favor to her, meaning he thinks it's really her responsibility and he's just covering for her. I believe he was annoyed that mom got to have fun while he was stuck home with the kids and this is actually punishment for the mom.\n\n \" I'm not going to celebrate you because you got to go on a trip and I'm stuck home doing your job, I'm helping you out.\" His reasoning is based on his frustration to have to \"do her job\" and watch the kids.. he thinks he's doing HER favor by watching his own kids. If you really think the mom is an AH on this case you may just as bad as the father. \n\n He wanted to hurt her. Narcissists often behave like this. They use birthdays and celebrations to minimize the person by refusing to bring attention or acknowledge the other persons happiness or achievements. It's common they start fights on others big days too. Their behavior is manipulative and it's done on purpose, it's not that he simply thought the child care was a gift, he's  punishing her for leaving him to watch the kids while she's having fun. He didn't want her to be celebrated because HE'S watching the kids for 4 days, which is a Mother's job. She most likely watches them all the time so her 4 day trip trumped the other days she's with the kids and she didn't actually deserve to be celebrated with a gift or dinner.

Two days later, my other two kids were up vomiting all night (with me helping). \n\nBy day 6, I\u2019ve got a stomach bug too, haven\u2019t slept properly in 4 nights, and my kids still expect me to do all their shit. \n\nI get it if dad was looking after the kids for 4 hours and didn\u2019t plan other stuff, but a 4 day beach vacation? \n\nHe\u2019s still a moron, but for her to say \u201cI see how you feel about me now\u201d after he just took care of kids for 4 days while she slept on a beach and went out dancing is\u2026a bit much.", "He'd probably still get one though and that's the rub.", "Maybe not even 30 seconds. Total.", "I just bought my daughter in law and her mother pandora bracelets for mothers day because she's gonna be a first time mom and we're both gonna be first time grammas together.  Is that bad?  I was gonna get them birthstone necklaces but he's coming at the end of the month so it could run into the next.", "Yeah I was being generous :-/", "Oh dear god yes thank you for saying it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "Maybe a long vacation away from him. He will think he\u2019s doing her a favor by \u201cbabysitting\u201d. His own kids.", "No card that says \u201clove u mom\u201d either, be thoughtful and take some time to make the gift", "Nah, that\u2019s sweet.\n\nAnd they make birthstone charms for the Pandora bracelets.  So you could always gift her the corresponding month charm to add to her bracelet once baby arrives.  Or they also make some super cute baby themed charms as well.\n\n\nCongrats on the grandbaby!", "Interesting, I am a male who does this, but only because I do the cooking, so she offers to do the dishes if she has had a shit day, so sometimes i'll say i'll wash the pots for you.", "I just came here to say I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not OPs wife.\n\nYTA", "INFO: Why are you married to someone you clearly don't respect or like enough to make any kind of effort to celebrate her one day a year?  And why did you have kids if you don't really enjoy spending time with them?", "How righteous of you to care for your own kids! What a man, a beautiful gift indeed, his wife should be eternally grateful as he had been already so benevolent of granting her a day off of her womanly duties /s\n\nYTA obviously.", "NTA - the fuck is wrong with the people here? Watching your kids for several days straight is indeed a big gift. Watching kids for several days solo is hard. Especially if you are used to co-parenting. Also it is weird having to get your spouse a gift for mothersday. She isn't your mommy... I hope.", "NTA The pro woman bias is showing in this post! A 4 day trip to the beach is absolutely a big favor / present in terms of doing the solo parenting required. It's not regular parenting. There's a bizarre need by some people here to be very dismissive of your efforts.", "I\u2019m a dad and personally I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. Could\u2019ve bought some flowers if you went out to the supermarket or something but if she went off on a mini vacation that is the gift. \n\nLike my wife is a stay at home mom and I work. Come home to take care of daughter and she gets a couple of days where she goes out by herself. She still complains. I\u2019ve never taken a single day off away from the family. She considers me going to work is my time off. Baffling what some women think.", "Nta she got a while ass trip for Mother\u2019s Day", "YTA your not \u201cwatching\u201d your kids you are being a parent and doing what she does everyday. You should of gotten her something or even got the kids to make her something.", "Yeah, you are. Being with your own children is not a gift that\u2019s parenting. You should have gotten her something.", "YTA, I\u2019m 21 and I made my mom a homemade meal, and homemade dessert and got her a present for when travels for work. Watching your kids is the bare minimum. Hope you don\u2019t get a gift on Father\u2019s Day.", "Only one way to find out! Book a 4 day guys trip during father's day and see what you get.", "Deadbeat ***husband, is that better?", "Yeah, I feel a lot of the other posters miss this point. She wasn't there for mothers day! Getting a present for it ties in with you know spending the day with your family. Talk about just cherry picking the parts of the day that suit you", "Nah man my parents never got each other anything on those days. I did bc they\u2019re MY parents. My parents would get THEIR parents gifts on those days", "Depends on your relationship/culture. My wife and I aren't huge on gifts for holidays. We often do nothing on mother's day, father's day or Valentine's Day. We do little things like a drawing from the little one, but we don't do big elaborate gifts. It's relaxed and that's the way we like it. We get each other gifts randomly when we feel like it.", "Flowers aren\u2019t given until they are in the vase. I have never once considered just handing over the flowers and leaving it at that.", "That and the all-day-every-Sunday paintball. No, just no.", "OMG, parents of a nuclear family don\u2019t really realize how good they have it.", "While I agree that taking care of the kids is just being a parent. Taking care of the kids solo so mom can go away for 4 days is a bit different IMO. Even if he does his share under normal circumstances, this is above and beyond.\n\nStill should have bought her flowers or something.", "It's not a gift unless it's up to both partners to decide if the vacation is possible but is only possible bc the non vacationing partner takes up extra work.\n\nI had a co worker that had to split weekend shifts w me. We were both equally responsible for the work and were salaried. I took 14 hours worth of work off his plate one weekend so he could go out of town for his bday. \n\nThere were several times where our lab was swamped that I had to go in on his weekend and vice versa. Neither of us were scheduled to work weekends, it just was conducive to our lifestyles to alternate coming in in order to make our work during the week less stressful. If I were to not show up on \"my weekend\", the whole department would get in trouble, not just me. \n\nI feel like if the only way for a parent to take a 4 day trip on mother's day requires the other parent to take on extra tasks, how is this not a gift? My parents never traveled growing up. I had 4 siblings. I remember when my dad's college friends went to go see Prince and invited him. It was a huge thing. My dad would have definitely bought my mom flowers or something if this situation was about him, but child me would have definitely seen this as my mom being \"allowed\" to travel for 4 days as the best gift ever. \n\nDoes OP and his wife constantly take solo trips that require the other to take on more tasks, or, as it sounds like to me, was this a unique situation that OP felt like was happening only bc of Mother's Day?", "If it's for a non work trip, it is a gift.", "Traveling for work is different though - it's an obligation and not for fun, you're working. Taking care of the kids on your own while your spouse is on vacation is in my opinion a type of gift (but no, should not have replaced a Mother's Day gift unless she specifically said \"for mother's day, I want to go on a trip while you watch our kids\")", "So what do you call it when your wife gives YOU the gift of alone time without the children?\n\nOh, what\u2019s that? She does that ALL the time anyway!?\n\nYTA and a horrible husband and parent. Excuse me, baby sitter apparently", "Hold up there for a minute. Stop assuming that everyone who does something stupid is a terrible person. your right that op should have gotten her something but a lapse in judgement doesnt mean op is the worst husband and father ever.", "Omg, yes. I too can throw a load of clothes and a tide pod into a washer 5 times in-between whatever nonsense I\u2019m binge-watching. However, it takes me a week to fold and put them away with two small toddlers!"]}
