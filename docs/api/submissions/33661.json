You\u2019re right that Jack is extremely common in children\u2019s literature, because it\u2019s a name with distinct sounds and is easily pronounced. You didn\u2019t even have him in mind.\n\nAlso, why are they acting like having a neurodiverse character named after him would be the worst thing in the world? Rhetorical question, it\u2019s the ableism, but I think that\u2019s telling on why they\u2019re so upset. They see neurodiversity as lesser, so they don\u2019t want that associated with a \u201cnormal\u201d child.", "NTA. I think one out of four boys is named Jack. It was unintentional and they should believe you when you tell them, and if their problem is with the character's (and your son's) condition then they suck.", "Is your family saying being neurodivergent is bad? Why are they mad?\n\nThis smells of ableism.\n\nNTA jack and john are extremely common names, there's really nothing identifying about them", "NTA.  I'm sure your husband's nephew doesn't have a copyright on his name.", "They're going to be real pissed at Tom Clancy.", "NTA. If your husband hadn't mentioned you were the author, there would have been nothing to connect your red-headed ND Jack to their Asian (probably brunette) NT Jack. \nJack is kind of the Ur-name in English storytelling.", "NTA I've accidentally named characters after real people and not noticed for months or years. It happens.", "NTA. Your character and your nephew don't resemble one another. More importantly, it's not connected to your name. This is a silly thing to be upset over.", "NTA because that is a very ableist stance by the inlaws.   \n\n\nHow horrible to have a neurospicy kid in a book have the same name as your kid! /s", "What exactly is the issue? I'm not getting it.\n\nNTA", "NTA- My sons name is Jack. I don't see an issue with a cute kid in a book named the same.", "Question - if you're married, isn't it also *your* nephew? Aren't you Aunt whoever to this child?", "You are NTA at all, although I\u2019m beginning to wonder which \u201cJack\u201d you husbands nephew is named after? Jack be nimble? Jack and Jill? Jack and the beanstalk? Jack is one of the most common names is nursery rhymes and children\u2019s literature it\u2019s ridiculous for them to claim the name.", "I find it hard to call anyone an asshole in this situation. So a NAH, but seriously\n\n> It was a time where we needed support from the family (and ongoing support at that) and instead it created this big issue\n\nYour husband reminds you that it's a name used in his family, what did you expect was going to happen? I get changing a name last minute is a pita, but this whole drama sas avoidable by renaming to Tom, John, David, Marc, Mo, Drake etc... any name not used in your expected support networks.", "YTA. As a writer, I totally get it. Characters can become very real to their authors, and calling them by a different name can feel nearly impossible. But in this case, this was brought to your attention in plenty of time to get used to things and make changes, and you didn\u2019t even really try. You felt your creative vision trumped the feelings of your family members. No asking or even warning. \n\nDo you know how many names there are in the world? Too many for there to be only one acceptable choice.", "YTA\u2014 sorry, but you were told before you published it so it wasn\u2019t unintentional. Why should they care what was going on in your head? If Jack is such a generic name, why are you so attached to it you don\u2019t care if it comes across as creepy?", "Everyone sucks here. You should have chosen a different name once you realized but your husbands family sound ableist. Why not another typical name like Sam or Joey?", "How can you even think yta!?!", "Yes. A.A.

It's not like OP wrote about a hell-child called Jack", "They said why - it's a strong and common name in literature, particularly children's books, and they didn't like the other names they tried out. They'd probably been working on it for a while and in their head the character just was 'Jack'. Authors don't have to run character names by everyone they know who share that name to make sure they aren't offended - because it's not about them! And besides, what is so bad about a kid having the same name as a neurodivergent character?

Sure, if you are actually naming a character after someone it's polite to ask permission, but equally you don't have to check if it's OK just because they happen to share a name. I'm sure Tolkien didn't go round every Sam he knew making sure no one was offended that he called a character Sam.", "It's their husband's nephew whom they barely see, of course they didn't think of him. I couldn't tell you the names of my partner's extended family because I've never met them, doesn't make me an asshole.", "Did you know a man named Sam Gamgee actually wrote to Tolkien?", "I did! Partly why I thought of it actually. I believe the real Gamgee said words to the effect of, \"wow, what a coincidence!\" which I think is the only reasonable response to an author using your name in a completely unrelated character, whether as common as Jack or unusual as Sam Gamgee", "NTA. 1) Jack is a REALLY common name. I think of Jack and the Beanstalk when I hear the name. The family is overreacting. 2) I REALLY don't like your husband's family being pissed off that you named a neuro diverse character the same name as the nephew.

This is some rando nephew that you are not close with, and was not the namesake of the character.\n\nDid Jack Nicholson also get upset? Jack Black? Jack Nicholas?
