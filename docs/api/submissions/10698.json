Now that we\u2019re about to have our first kid, we decided to quit doing anything, including both of us quitting smoking weed. One of her uncles passed recently, and we were offered his house for a really good price. This house is on 20+ acres of land, and has a lot of room for us to expand if we decide to have more kids down the line. Currently she is working, but she plans to be a stay at home mom, so the burden of paying for this mortgage (and everything else) is going to fall on me.\n\n   Yesterday, my wife decided to tell me that she overheard me taking with my siblings about how it would be nice to set up a greenhouse (for general vegetables/plants) and she thought I meant to grow weed. I wasn\u2019t planning on growing weed in that greenhouse, but I definitely want to have a few plants somewhere on my 20+ acres of land, especially since it\u2019s recently legalized (we live in NY). She tried to tell me it was illegal, which it most certainly isn\u2019t, and also thats majorly hypocritical coming from someone who has done way worse things from weed, which I hate to break it to her, but was illegal. I understand now that we have a kid coming she might not want the kid to grow up with weed all around them, but i\u2019m not about to pay most of my salary to buy land that I can\u2019t do what I want to do with. Especially when what I want to do is neither illegal nor immoral. \n\n   So her and I got into an argument, and I told her I married a moron. She was really hurt by this, and we haven\u2019t spoken since last night. But honestly, that\u2019s how i\u2019m feeling, and to be honest I don\u2019t really want to buy this house with her if it means that she\u2019s going to start telling me what I can and cannot do like that. Especially since i\u2019m going to be paying for everything. All I want is a few plants to have some bud without having to buy it from another person. I work full time and am finishing up my bachelors, it\u2019s not like i\u2019m some stoner slouch who wants to start weed empire. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: For all of you who are saying I should have tried to have a civil discussion, I actually did. I didn\u2019t just jump to calling her a moron, but after trying to have a reasonable discussion where I explained how I felt about the situation. I told her I didn\u2019t want to have more than one or two plants, and explained that theres nothing illegal about having plants as an adult in New York. I told her I understand that she doesn\u2019t want to raise our kids around it, and I told her that I would keep it far out of sight. She comes from an anti-weed Christian background, but they\u2019re all perfectly fine with alcohol. I feel like thats bullshit that people will be able to come and get drunk on our property, but weed is forbidden. Sorry, but fuck that. I only called her a moron when she ignored everything I had to say on the matter, so it\u2019s not like she values what I think anyway.\n\nUpdate: I apologized to my wife for calling her a moron, and expressed that I am indeed the moron. I told her we can discuss this further when I get home from work, and tbh at this point I don\u2019t really care about having a plant.", "created_utc": 1677138058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119rvyp/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_married_a_moron/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "Bro just buy a joint every once in a while if you wanna smoke so bad.", "I have nothing against smoking weed, but if you agreed not to do it, that's what you agreed to. If you only agreed to do stop while she's pregnant, then I see no issue. But it's still not clear to me if you were transparent about wanting to smoke again after the baby was born. If you were, I don't know why she would be upset so long as you aren't smoking where the kid could be affected by secondhand smoke. Doesn't she smoke too? Is she planning to quit for good? It feels like this may be less about the weed and more about a miscommunication of expectations", "You\u2019re looking for a relationship sub then. \n\nTelling her what you said here seems like a good start: \n>I think I\u2019m justified, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m right. I love my wife, and I don\u2019t want her to feel hurt, but I also am my own person who has my own feelings and I am also kind of hurt that I don\u2019t feel she can ever see my side. It\u2019s like its her way or the highway. I don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s right either.\n\nYou acknowledged you both messed up. \n\nYou made sure to remember you loved her and don\u2019t want her to be hurt \n\nYou clarified that the fight was somewhat fueled from the previous frustration of feeling dismissed", "Tbf, I actually had my medical card and don\u2019t abuse this substance, especially since the baby is coming I gave all of my weed stuff away(bongs, rolling papers, hell even my lighters). I also don\u2019t drink or anything else, so weed for me has been a once in a while relief. She comes from a really anti-weed Christian background, so really this is where it\u2019s coming from. She told me she was going to quit drinking and doing other substances many-many times and continued to do it time and time again, so I don\u2019t feel bad about wanting to smoke occasionally. Also she married me knowing damn well my family is huge into weed culture. We all smoke together including my dad and mom\u2019s mom during Christmas. Her family are all angry alcoholics. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "people arent perfect and they get mad, Sometimes a wife and husband have those moments when they throw out an insult in the heat of the moment and while he shouldnt have called her a moron, he just felt strongly about what he had to say, the same way that she did and he was factually correct. As for quitting smoking weed part i mean he could be talking a few years down the road when he plans on having any plants, it could be a temporary agreement they made, and hes also his own person so he could choose to smoke weed again if he really if he really wanted to and decided it was more worth it or something idk you really need some more context as to the dynamics of peoples relationships before assumptions like labeling them as unhealthy ykno", "Lets be very clear about two things here: Her uncle is dead, and the person who is selling this property is absolutely being fairly compensated for this land. It is a good deal for both of us as we do not have to go through a realtor, and the process will be relatively easy on both of us as theres no rush in the timeframe. I absolutely could not purchase this house and find a different house, and it would make no difference to me whatsoever. People put houses on the market every day, and there are fuck tons of good deals out there. I could go buy a house from a couple who has to sell it through a divorce, or a foreclosed house etc. It is not like the person selling us this property is even selling it to us for below the market value of the house. \n\nSecondly, I work a minimum of 40+ hours a week, and study physics. So you can fuck right off with saying that being a stay at home mom is as difficult as that. If she wanted to keep working, we could absolutely afford to pay a full time nanny. But I love her and she doesn\u2019t want to do that, so i\u2019m going to support her decision. That being said, do not pretend that her changing diapers and playing peppa pig is even half as difficult as solving differential equations after you get out of working a full day. I get up at 4am every day, and don\u2019t get the opportunity to bed until 11pm most nights. I fix both of our cars myself no matter how difficult to save money. When something goes wrong with the house, do you think she\u2019s going to be the one replacing the hot water heater, or hell even shoveling the (long) driveway? And anything she asks of me I generally oblige. On top of that I still constantly bring her home flowers, candies, and make sure she knows how loved she is. So you can fuck right off", "Right? Like I understand - I smoke myself but he isn't alone. OP's wife has say in this as well and he has to think about his child. \n\nHe also wouldn't have gotten a good price for the land if he wasn't married to his wife.", "Then my earlier comment was correct: you both aren't communicating in a healthy manner. You rug swept the weed issue when you got married knowing she was from an anti weed background and you see weed as an occasional relief you don't want to give up. Neither of you are wrong, you just have different values and are communicating poorly. And you both seem to be carrying resentment for the other person AND their family circumstances. No one picks their childhood environment,  but they CAN choose a therapist and learn to communicate effectively.  Sounds like yall should do couples counseling, and learn to come to a healthy compromise.", "You don\u2019t view weed as something \u201coccasional\u201d if this is a hill you\u2019re willing to die on. You verbally abused your wife after you both agreed to quit and she called you out. This marriage is not going to last. YTA \n\nBTW, I\u2019m typing this as someone who smokes weed daily.", "Ok, but a husband and wife should communicate with respect. If you're old enough to be married with a baby on the way, you're old enough to choose your words respectfully. Anger isn't an excuse to verbally put someone down or name call, just like anger isn't an excuse to hit someone. Raise the bar, don't lower it.", "Ooh, you work 40 hours a week! How unusual and hard!", "Hahahahhaah you are a complete AH. I feel for this woman she has no idea the kind of human being she reproduced with.", "YTA. That\u2019s some toxic view on SAH parenthood. \u201cChanging diapers and playing Peppa Pig.\u201d\n\nYou are gonna end up bow-legged from your high horse. \n\nFunny how you adulting deserves a gold star sticker and a ticker tape parade, but all she gets is derision in her role and the notion that she should have an equal say in decision-making. \n\nAnd if growing weed is your hill to die on, that\u2019s fine, but maybe evaluate whether you placing it in that level of importance so much so that you are demeaning your wife says something about you.", "Ah ok so you think you\u2019re better than her, don\u2019t understand the value of a mother\u2019s love over the care of a nanny, and don\u2019t value respectful conversation in a marriage relationship (as opposed to some bro on the street calling you a moron).", "Do you even like your wife??? You have zero respect for her at all. Everything you\u2019ve written, from your post to your comments, has been condescending as hell. You clearly view yourself as higher than your wife because you study engineering and physics? Guess what buddy, that doesn\u2019t give you the moral ground to insult your wife. Stop belittling her. \n\nI hope she finds this post so she knows what an AH you are.", "My job is a hell of a lot more complex and challenging than sitting on my ass in front of a computer all day then solving differential equations in my free time, and it is still easier than being at home with a tiny, unpredictable and helpless being that is completely dependent on you and feeds on you body and requires constant monitoring almost 24/7 for the first few months. Then it gets more challenging when they get mobile and you need to watch them like a hawk. \nHope you are better than you come across in this post, otherwise I really feel for your wife when little one arrives.", "You should revisit your comment after your baby is born. Newborns have this amazing way of humbling the fuck out of you. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you hate your wife. I feel pretty sorry for her and this child she's carrying. You are so resentful already to the women literally carrying your baby and planning on caring for it full time.", "Fr. OP is acting like the land belongs to only him because his wife will be a SAHM when the baby is born. Huge red flag.", "Tbh that\u2019s probably going to have to be the solution, but I think it\u2019s straight up moronic to think that not having a plant is going to stop your kids from growing up and trying weed. I\u2019d rather my kids smoke weed every day than grow up to be alcoholics. So having a plant on a property that large honestly is no indication of parental skills. But sure, let\u2019s all pretend that this is a huge deal and i\u2019m a bad dad. Whatever helps you guys sleep at night. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "it was a pretty mild insult at best he didn\u2019t really berate her at da end of the day just saying people arent gonna be their 100% perfect versions of themselves every time a tense situation comes up, im sure your parents probably were all rainbows and flowers and argument free with perfect communication right?", "Of course your kids are going to grow up experimenting with weed, alcohol, etc. But you have an INFANT on the way. Not a 17 year old. \n\nI smoke daily but guess what? I don\u2019t keep my weed around my five year old relatives or ANYONE who isn\u2019t comfortable with it. \n\nAlso, getting a weed plant on the property (where you kids will presumably be raised) needs to be a unanimous decision between you and your wife. If one person says yes, but the other says no, then the answer is no.", "We're not talking about an almost adult but an infant and it's a shared space not your own place. Doesn't matter what kind of relationship you have this is something everyone has to agree with.\n\nJust because the child is going to experiment with it doesn't mean you have to surround your kid with these things. It's also not a sure thing they will experiment with it. I tell you this as someone who grew up in a household where the adults smoked. \n\nPreferably you hope your child doesn't get addicted to neither.", "No, but as an adult, I spent the last decade of my life learning healthy communication skills to be better than the generation before me. Like I said, raise the bar, don't lower it. Using your childhood as an excuse reflects poorly on an individual once they're a grown adult capable of self improvement.  This is a learning opportunity for OP AND his wife, because neither of them is communicating in a healthy manner.", "This whole post is written like OP doesn\u2019t even like his wife.", "All you're doing in this thread is defending verbal abuse.", "But wouldnt you think thats more than likely why OP came to reddit to post about this? he\u2019ll probably use the responses as a learning opportunity, As an adult you learned to be a healthy person, but so is OP and his wife more than likely it all happens at a different time for everyone", "Hi OP, nice burner account \ud83d\udc4b", "Thx, i\u2019ve been saving it for just such an occasion. I came here to consider an alternative perspective, but I don\u2019t feel that means I have to have people be able to find additional information about me or my family outside of my question. I think thats a reasonable use of a burner \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: teacher is not my account. I misunderstood Okayostrich, try not to break your arms jerking yourselves off."]}
