It's rude and entitled. If she wanted a marriage more than she wanted a wedding and party, she'd be willing to marry him at the courthouse. NTA", "NTA but being family not always means sticking with them. Your sister is entitled and saying that you don't want to cut her off because is family is a way of having very toxic and mentally painful relationships. Sometimes being family isn't enough.", "This is pure speculation, but I would guess that those divorces are probably mostly those who get into huge amounts of debt for their wedding, or those who care more about the optics of the wedding being expensive than about the actual marriage. Again I don\u2019t know, but it makes sense to me", "I don't believe that's true I believe the statistic is strictly wedding cost to divorce rate.", "Yeah. It's also kinda misleading because people in high socioeconomic status (i.e. wealthy people or high income earners) are much less likely to divorce. They're also more likely to get married in the first place as well, compared to low income people.", "What do others think that she helped with?", "22k is a drop in the ocean? Bloody hell.", "You said what I was thinking and put it into better words.", "I agree.\n\nTell her 'Dear sister, if you want to see a golddigger or at least a golddigger-wannabe, please look into the next mirror.'\n\nOr is that called 'golddigger by proxy'?", "Standing ovation! Beautiful response.", "I believe it is directly wedding cost to divorce. I have seen it too.", "No the study just compare cost to divorce ratings to follow the trend of the industry of wedding becoming more and more a big circus and stressful on the couple not only financially.\nCelebrity get divorced a lot I doubt they get in any debt for their lavish affairs. It\u2019s 1 study eh, but my divorced friend like to bring it up all the time talking about his ex wife. This is why I found it hilarious. And no they didn\u2019t went to any debt for it just wanted different things I guess until the very end.", "https://www.csus.edu/faculty/m/fred.molitor/docs/wedding%20expenses%20and%20marriage%20duration.pdf\n\nThis discusses debt stress as a major cause of the divorce rate. It\u2019s the study most articles reference for this statistic so you can decide. When I read it, I felt it was more debt related \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but the study states more info should be collected about each couple.", "I\u2019m very sorry you\u2019re going through this. You are NTA. Your sister is though. She sounds very entitled, and so does her husband. They need to live within their means. Just because your means are bigger doesn\u2019t mean you should have to give them some of it.", "Ah, I thought you meant OP alone sitting down with sister and sister's fiance.  Yes, OP should have her parents and/or husband with her.", "That's awesome", "Definitely not alone. Bad idea. I will make it clearer.", "NTA. You and your husband are in no way responsible for her wedding. Where would this stop? She wants a new car, house, fancy holiday? Should you be paying for all that too? No thanks, find your own way sister.", "Then she sends flying monkeys to annoy you about it? The harassment is plenty good reason to not give her anything.", "NTA its her wedding her, her partner and parents to finance it. To your sister I will say that weddings that cost less come also with a lower rate of divorces. This is statistic.", "Lol."]}
