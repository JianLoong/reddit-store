Having a big, expensive wedding isn\u2019t a necessity.", " I hope her friends came up with that on their own, rather than repeating something your sister has expressed.", "It's Husband's money--why should he pay for SIL's wedding?  That's crazy.", "Well, for starters it is not her money. Her husband\u2019s family is rich, doesn\u2019t mean he is. And even if he is, and they share all worldly goods, it isn\u2019t her decision alone, the husband has a word as well. With that kind of money  believe \u201c2 yes/1 no\u201d applies. And if I were the husband, at this point I\u2019d say no and not go to the wedding.", "This is it. And I'd point out too that if she chose her husband 'for the right reasons' it shouldn't matter how big or extravagant the wedding is, it should be the joy of finally marrying her soulmate that makes the day, and that can be done anywhere- in a church hall, in a barn, on a beach, whatever. There's no need to try and spend \u00a322k on a wedding when you cannot afford it... If it is all about love like she claims.", "Everyone gives money at a wedding, but as a gift. Asking to fund it to the tune of tens of thousands is sort of bananas", "Ask her why your husband's families' wealth is some how entitled to her?", "Your sister thinks you\u2019re a gold digging asshole - who owes her - and that\u2019s what she\u2019s told others.

You need to have serious re-setting of boundaries with her.", "She is a grown woman making life choices and needs to realize her lifestyle is not your lifestyle.", "This is spot on, today it\u2019s her wedding, tomorrow her dream home, the list will grow.\n\nI\u2019m always shocked when people feel entitled to other peoples money!!", "THIS, exactly!\n\nFirst, it will be paying towards the wedding.  Then, paying towards a house.  Then, furnishing said house.  Then, a baby is coming... more money will be requested.  And on and on and on.  You have to shut down the Bank is Sister/BIL now.\n\nNTA", "I completely understand the sentiment, but I don't think OP should be alone w/ the sister b/c it is really hard to not cave in a situation like this. It can also lead to the sister lying about the conversation after.\n\nI think OP needs to discuss the possibility w/ her parents and see if the mom and/or dad can handle that specific discussion. They are in a much better place right now to manage that convo.\n\nI do think OP (and her husband - if I didn't make that clear before) need to put up a united front to both the sister and the fiance for a couple of reasons. 1 The sister doesn't have to be the one to deliver the message to the fiance by herself. If the fiance is who you suspect he is, this isn't good. 2. If the fiance is who I suspect he is, the only way he will back down is by having OP's husband there delivering the message w/ her and backing up the legal action threat. It is unfortunate, but it is also probably true.", "I\u2019d like to thank Reddit for preparing me for the fallout should I ever actually win the lottery.  \nPeople I\u2019ve never met coming out of the woodwork claiming \u201cbut faaaamily!\u201d?  \nI\u2019m ready.
