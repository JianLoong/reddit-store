They didn\u2019t chip in for me even though they offered I rejected them as my husband payed for the entire thing. He\u2019s very wealthy and so are his side of the family so it was a very big extravagant wedding. My sister was one of my bridesmaids and I payed for her bridesmaid dress and payed for everything. I spent hours organising my wedding and spent a lot of money and organisation to make it the best day ever. My sister helped with my hen weekend a little with organisation and not financially. My best friend and maid of honour helped me the most with everything.\n\nAnyways my sister now is getting married and she wants my husband to pay for it. It\u2019s \u00a322000 that she wants us to pay for. We told her that that\u2019s ridiculous and she should try to pay for her own wedding or get our parents help. She then got angry at me saying my wedding was 1000x more expensive and that I had the money and wasn\u2019t being fair.\n\nHer friends and her husband have been saying that we are snobby and treat them badly and won\u2019t pay anything towards their wedding when my sister helped out \u2018so much\u2019 with mine. I\u2019ve even gotten messages off some of her friends calling me an awful person. Someone even said that apparently she married her husband for the \u2018right reasons\u2019 and not for money which really upset me. I don\u2019t know if there was anything I could do or if I\u2019m in the wrong for refusing that.", "created_utc": 1688654963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sbf4l/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your responsibility to pay for someone else's wedding. If they can't afford it, they should a) scale back to what they can afford, or b) take your parents up on their offer. That money might not be much to a wealthy family but that doesn't mean they have to be overly generous either.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter if your husband is a billionaire, or if your sister was the most helpful bridesmaid in history, the money your husband earns (or even inherited) is not your sister's to spend. It's really that simple. I'd love to hear her trying to explain why it is, though . . . \n\nYou're right. She should spend the money she has. Frankly, she shouldn't even be asking your parents to pay. It's one thing for them to OFFER to help, but no one is entitled to money that other people earned . . . not even their own parents, once the kids are adults, unless it is a genuine life-and-death emergency, like becoming homeless.\n\n(Oh, but dear God, the word is **paid**.

She is demonstrating she believes she has a valid right to you and your husband's money. What is next? House? New car for future hubby? \n\nThis is not about your wedding cost or your wedding dress, that is just emotional manipulation. This is about her entitlement.\n\nYou and your husband discuss this, decide what you want to do for her. Offer her that.
