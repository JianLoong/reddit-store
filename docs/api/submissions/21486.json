The noise from her friends etc is nonsense - you already know this since you blocked them !  With my children, for both university and weddings, I told them right at the beginning what my financial contribution would be and that it was up to them to decide whether to work within that budget, top up with their own resources or debt, panhandle around the family, etc. Obviously the time has passed for you to take this approach with your sister but it\u2019s not too late for you to tell her your level of support, including none if that\u2019s the answer, and let her sort out the rest.
