I used to work a really stressful job with hard hours and terrible coworkers. I was also supplementing my income by renting out the third bedroom in my house. The other spare was a guest room/storage. She paid/pays me 700 every month and we used to split the utilities in half.\n\nThings got really bad at work, and I wanted to leave. I decided to clean out the guest room and rent it out. I told my roommate, and she was unhappy, because she didn't want to share a bathroom. I pointed out her share of the utilities would go down, but she didn't really care about that. Anyway, I rented out the room. Not long after I quit my job.\n\nAnyway, my mortgage is 1500 a month, so right now I'm paying about $100 a month plus the rent from both girls and living off of my savings while I look for a job. My roommate noticed I'm not going into work anymore. I told her I left that job and am looking for a new one. She said \"so now you're a professional homeowner, basically?\" I disagreed with that assessment. She said I'm leeching off of her and the other girl because I don't want to work.\n\nI do want to work. It's just that I need to find a new job, and since people need cheap places to stay, renting out these rooms allows me to keep paying my mortgage while I look. My roommate says I'm taking advantage of her, but she chose to move in here. I don't consider myself to be a leech, but she thinks I'm a selfish asshole.

While I think your mental health is important and it's good you found a way to quit a toxic job to better your situation... you did kind of screw her.\n\nPart of agreeing to pay x amount of rent is what goes with it. She moved in thinking there was going to be one other person and having her own bathroom. You decided to change that without actually giving her a discount on her rent - which I think you should, especially with the bathroom thing - and just depended on \"less on utilities\" (which will it be?) to make up for it.\n\nWhat makes me further think you kind of suck with this is that you knew you were going to tick her off with this move but that your being able to quit was dependent on her not moving out. It may have been subconsciously - I don't think you are a bad person - but part of your choice to do this is that you knew you held all the cards and that even though she's going to be in a worse position, mental health wise, there is nothing she can do about it.\n\nI think she went a bit too far, but you sprung her having less privacy, less of her own space, with no discount on rent on her, so her bitterness and anger is understandable.\n\nI really don't think you are a bad person, and I really don't think you saw anything wrong with what you are doing, but I really think she should be paying a little less in rent.\n\nDo with that what you will...\n\n\\*edit\\* \"Just move out\" that's what I mean by OP holds all the cards, OP needed her roommate to not \"just move out\" and knows how bad it is right now with rents jumping and places being left empty, so OP could change the rules and there is little  the roommate can do about it.

I agreed to the rent amount when the home was presented as a two-person occupancy. Adding a third person changes the equation. If I had a longer lease, I\u2019d be looking to see if I could legally break it without a fee. If it were month-to-month, I\u2019d be looking to leave as soon as I could manage.

There must be a lot of landlords on this sub.\n\nYou're a live-in landlord AND you pulled a bait-and-switch on your tenant. You are especially TA if you never made the tenant aware that the room may be rented out in the future.

At the very least you should be charging them less, wtf.", "YTA.

Adapting to one person can be hard , adapting to two can be miserable. Also, I'm not sure if you have a lease with your tenant but there might be stipulations regarding this in the lease.

Yeah, you suck. You ARE leeching. Lower her rent amount if you are changing the agreed upon terms to living there.", "YTA for changing the terms of the living arrangement. Sharing a bathroom is much different than having your own bathroom. You're not wrong for being a landlord or for taking the time to find a new job, but you need to reduce her rent since you've changed the living arrangements.", "It sounds like you sprung this new tenant on your original one without much consultation. She\u2019s perfectly valid in her expectation to have a private bathroom, esp if it was outlined in the lease you had her sign. She\u2019s right to be upset about it, especially since you have not even offered to reduce her rent. This kind of stuff is exactly why I rent from companies instead of private homeowners - because at least apartment companies don\u2019t try to stick another random stranger in my home without my consent.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re upset by her implication that you\u2019re a mooch because she\u2019s paying for the home you live in, then it\u2019s time to get going on that new job, because she\u2019s not wrong about that either.", "Yes YTA. Shocked at all these N t a votes. She agreed to move into the house at a set rate based on having one roommate and access to a spare room. Now she has to share the living space with a whole other person for the same cost. Plus you\u2019re suddenly home all day, adding to wear and tear, mess, lack of privacy etc. You\u2019re absolutely stiffing her based on what she agreed to pay for a year ago. Would you pay the same amount to live with 2 roommates instead of one? I sure wouldn\u2019t. Would you be totally peachy keen if she  moved a romantic partner in and suddenly they were in your bathroom, cooking in your kitchen, parking behind your car, whatever minor inconveniences having extra roommates brings. \n\nIf you want to rent both rooms you need a agreement with roommates who both agree up front with that and price it accordingly.

Sure, the renter should have done their due diligence and signed a contract and everything, but with significantly better rent than they'd have otherwise, can you blame them?

Not cool.", "the people saying that this girl should be evicted or have her rent hiked up bc someones feelings are hurt are genuinely psychotic, yes it was rude but to take away her house over it ??? this just goes to show the crazy power imbalance that can come with living with your landlord. atleast OP seems like a decent person that isnt listening to this awful petty advice.", "YTA. Your roommate was right when she said you were leeching off of her. It's one thing to own a house that you rent out to tenants *and don't live in*, but because you live there you are technically a roommate. You had a new person move in despite your roommate vocalizing her unhappiness with this situation - and rightfully so, you threw a wrench into a living situation that sounds like it was going well until you did this - and so now YOU are not paying rent, but the two roommates are splitting your mortgage payment?? That doesn't make any fucking sense. If a third roommate moves in, then everyone should be paying the same amount. So you should have reduced your roommate's rent as well, especially because she would no longer have a private bathroom.\n\nI've had two different roommates pull this, both times it was a three bedroom house. Both times, my other housemate and I were PISSED. You're applying landlord logic to a roommate situation, and think that your roommates should be understanding and cool with you not contributing to the house financially whatsoever because you own it. But you have put yourself in this situation. You bought a house that you couldn't afford on your own (literally why did you do that), you lived with a roommate and then suddenly decided to quit your job and thought your roommate would be supportive of you upending the house suddenly?? You can either be the landlord, and rent to two or three people and live in another house. Or you can be the roommate and split things equally. But you can't do both and expect other people to be cool with it. You're a major AH.", "YTA. Sounds like you may not have a lease for your roommate as her landlord. If you did, it would specify what exactly she is renting. You normally rent a whole unit or a room.

Utilities are less, sure but that isn't what she agreed/expected when moving in. Unless she knew from the start that there was a possibility this would happen someday and she agreed, I can understand why she's not happy about it.

Then she moved someone into the den... 5 people. Then she decided to put a wall up halfway through the living room, converting it into another bedroom... 6 people. And then her boyfriend moved in... 7 people. My rent never went down, and I talked to the other tenants, and they were paying MORE than me, $900-1050. This is an extreme situation obviously, but you can see how frustrating it was for me. Was she allowed to do this? Yes. Was it right? I don't think so personally.

If I was OP's tenant I'd be looking into my legal options for getting rent lowered and overpayments reimbursed just because OP was a jerk about it.

In addition she has lost her single bathroom which if you advertised/contracted on the basis she would have one, could get tricky. I don't think you're the asshole but I think you would be if you raised the rent due yo a personal disagreement.", "You don't have to be confrontational. You also aren't obligated to renew her lease. Which is my suggestion. Make sure you do this legally and correctly but I would frame it as, \"You have made it clear you aren't comfortable with living in my home and I'm going to forgo renewing your lease so you have the opportunity to find a residence better suited to your needs without breaking the lease.\" This is also what I would have advised her to do. I'm a poor person. I also rent. I chose the shitty low income apartments vs a roommate for medical reasons that paid off for me with pandemic. It's not perfect but I am also not the one on the hook for the leaky roof, broken appliances (they're included in my lease), and I can find a more expensive non rent controlled option with less crime if I wanted. I just would starve. I don't pretend my landlord is my friend because it's a business transaction. \n\nEven when I rented a room no one was my friend after the first time I fell for that manipulation. Living together with someone owning the space is absolutely a choice. It does not mean you owe them something outside your lease. You may want to look into hiding your ownership from future tenants and using a management company or something along that line so you have a buffer this way. If she doesn't want roommates she needs to live in a single person space and pay for that.", "She's paying below market and giving shit to the person whose house she's living in.  That's the power trip here: being an AH to OP who is obviously high strung and mousy.\n\n  Newsflash: OP doesn owe a room to her.  OP didn't give birth to the brat.", "Yes - I bought my first house last year after many, many years of living in share houses. I rent out a room in my house - if I want to change the conditions of the house so that someone is sharing a bathroom and also sharing the house space with an extra person, then the rent should be lowered to reflect that. \n\nI think the tenant is annoyed about that - not so much about you not working (unless you\u2019re home all the time and that is yet another encroachment on her use of the house!!!) \n\nYour tenant is not just paying rent for her room, she is paying rent for the use of the house. You changed that use, and didn\u2019t lower the rent even by $5 or $10 a week. \n\nHonestly, this is a YTA. (Although - the tenant should have asked for a reduction in rent or said she would move out, so it\u2019s kind of on her too).", "Ah  yes.  I missed this.", "So she moves and has to pay more for a room in that area, but at least knows it from the beginning and OP gets even more from someone who isn't salty.  Win/win.\n\nOr she doesn't move because she realizes she's not going to do any better, and gets over herself to keep peace with the person whose house she lives in, after a reality check about her situation.  Also a win win.\n\nTell me the downside of asking salty tenant to pay market rates again?  I lost it in there somewhere", "Nobody ever said she had a private restroom. To me it sounds like an extra restroom he\u2019 has and maybe it\u2019s the regular common restroom that she just so happens to not have to share because he has his private one\u2026And if it\u2019s a shared restroom It Hass to say in the lease that she doesn\u2019t have to share it with any more than one person; needs to be specific. Is there anything in the lease that says he\u2019s not allowed to have family stay, Does it specify how the restroom is shared etc etc if it doesn\u2019t then she\u2019s not entitled to compensation for changes aren\u2019t even specified in the lease", "It's not illegal, if there's no lease in most jurisdictions it's month to month.

You're talking out of your ass.\n\nIf  tenant doesn't like it, tenant is free to move.    OP made clear that tenant is living there paying under market rates.  If anyone is taking advantage of anyone it's bratty tenant who's using OPs obvious issues with confrontation to live under market rates in someone else's house and acting like they're entitled to it.\n\nHow is someone living in their own house and paying a mortgage as best they can a leech? Lol.   In what fucking world view is tenant owed OP's labor?  OP should work to help keep tenant from paying more?  Lmao.

Forcing someone out of their home by making changes to their living arrangement against their protests still makes someone a jerk.", "This is AITA not legal advice. Of course he has the right. But it's an asshole move to have someone move in on some pretenses and then change it afterwards.", "I understand being afraid of confrontation, but you gotta learn to stand up for yourself.

Shit sounds great on reddit but doesn't work in the real world", "Totally agree. The important thing is that you understand that you have not done anything that is wrong or crummy in any way. At all. If the first tenant does not like sharing a bathroom, she can find a new place. It's that simple. She was being a total jerk to you. Don't let it affect your self-image.\n\nThe one thing you can learn from this is that if you decide to let a room go vacant in the future, you need to make it clear to the present tenant that having the bathroom to themselves is a courtesy that they may lose if you decide to rent out the second room of future point.", "Once OP gets a job and the lease runs out, Miss Thing should just gtfo. And OP can shut the lease renewal off, or deny a month-to-month if done...I think, at least a full month in advance? IANAL, so OP should check on their rights in their state on that one.", "I remember that one, the tenant tried to force that OP out of her own home, saying the management company said they could have the whole place or something like that.", "Long term, this is actually the right answer.  If you're going to be a landlord, be professional and self protective about it.", "In that one, though, the owner and the tenants were in separate living quarters, not sharing space. That's legally different, and the owner has more rights when they share the living space with the lodger. It may be advantageous to have the lodger know they are sharing space with the owner and don't have the same rights of a tenant.", "u/Miserable-Hat-6390 Pay attention to this.

This is a purely transactional relationship.  Tenant wants to be an asshole, tenant cam pay market rates.  OP made clear they charge less than average", "Another way to look at it- she's paying almost $1000 a month (including util) for a bedroom. Whether that's below market or not depends on the area but that's still ridiculous.", "I mean OP could've just changed the terms of the lease ( if there is an official one, haven't seen in the comments yet) whenever it was up as well, and considering they're offering below market for the area then fuck em, OP NTA.

Absolutely not, however, I remembered that I was a tenant foremost, (though the owners are my friends, have been for over 13 yrs. prior and still current since) the new girl and I showed respect for one another, I removed half of my items from the bathroom so she could have equal space and we managed to get along with one another.

The living conditions she agreed to have changed.", "You have leases, right?", "Then the response is easy. \"Oh I'm sorry that this arrangement no longer works for you. So when exactly are you planning on moving so I can have another tenant set up for the vacancy?\" And really that's just a nice reminder that she is infact a tenant, NOT a roommate.

She still has that. \n\nI'm in a place where room renting is pretty popular. No one I know who's done it has had a choice on whether their landlord/roommate rented out an additional extra room. Even great setups, where my partner's bff has rented the same room for 8+ years, gets discounts for dog and house sitting when the landlords travel, and is genuinely friends with them, doesn't get veto power when they choose to rent out the other bedrooms. \n\nIt's the difference between being equal roommates, where you signed up so that everyone had to agree on big decisions (such as a new roommate), versus tenancy, where you signed on knowing you'd have no control over anything but your private space (even then, you can't do modifications without permission).\n\nTenant signed on knowing that they weren't an equal roommate with equal say. Knowing that OP could rent out the other room (tho he didn't have any plan to do so at the moment) and that wouldn't change the tenant's rent. That's not how tenancy works. \n\nOP can choose to do kind and change the rate, but it's already below market rate by $100 a month. OP is doing the right thing and making sure utilities are split fairly. That's all OP owes legally or morally."]}
