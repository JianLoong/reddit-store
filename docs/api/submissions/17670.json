Even with all the support the school has, I fear for his safety and mental health every single day. \n\nI grew up in an extremely religious and judgmental family, so comments and demands like the ones your family members are making are sadly familiar to me. It was embarrassing and I'd roll my eyes, but mostly, I ignored it because it didn't really affect me. I'm glad I started being more vocal after my kids were born but I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't realize how unbelievably cruel and dangerous that behavior is until it was aimed at my own child. I now understand that all of those times I was silent, I was allowing cruelty and violence to be thrown at innocent people who just want to be themselves.\n\nThis IS the time to stand up and draw a line in the sand.", "You\u2019re going to lose your family over a stranger? Bruh", "NTA\n\nGood for you for sticking up for Theo. \"You can only come to my wedding if you don't act transphobic, bigoted, or racist\" is a perfectly reasonable demand for your guests. Your family told you they are unwilling to be civil and insist on using slurs against Theo, they don't get to come and spew that hate.", "NTA. But it\u2019s very sweet your finance and his bff are not asking you to choose and telling you not to fight with your family. It shows they care about your happiness over their own. I would have uninvited them too.", "NTA You won't lose your family over Theo. You are losing your family because they are rude AH", "Are you losing family over Theo? Or the fact that they are homophobic bigots? NTA", "Absolutely NTA. They don\u2019t get to control what your guests wear at your wedding. Honestly it\u2019s sad Theo even had to ask *you* but I respect him for doing it because it obviously attracts attention from bigots.\n\nIt seems like your family has a lot of shitty views, props to you for not going along with it. I can\u2019t believe they were willing to skip your wedding over what a guest was wearing", "NTA. Tell Theo that he\u2019s not the problem, just the final nail in the coffin.\n\nAlso, I believe the word you were looking for was either overalls or romper", "NTA - I wouldn't uninvite anyone. If the LGBT haters decide not to show, it is on them,", "NTA, good on you for sticking up for what's right.  \n\nTell Theo that while you appreciate his stance, that if you let your family win this battle, it simply makes it harder for them to ever take your stance seriously.", "Its your circus, your monkeys but having your whole family not witness one of the biggest days of your life over a dress seems a bit much but its your call to make. NAH.", "NTA", "\"My family would rather skip my wedding than attend because a man *they don't even know*, and *who isn't in the wedding party* will wear clothes that isn't stereotypical men's clothing.\"\n\nI think if you rewrite it this way, you'll know that you are NTA.", "NTA", "I was prepared to say yes, but your family sucks. NtA", "NTA. Your family are the ones that said they will not come if Theo is invited and you will not be uninviting Theo. They are the ones who created the ultimatum, not you. So that\u2019s on them.", "NTA\n\nLike you said, would have happened sooner or later. Best of luck to em.", "Nta.  I like your style- we need more people in the world like you.", "NTA. It's good to stand up to bigotry", "NTA. Good for you for standing up to bullies!\n\nAnd I believe your friend is wearing a jumpsuit or romper. Some of them are absolutely gorgeous.", "NTA. I get it, it\u2019s your family, important people etc\u2026. But you are starting your own life with your husband. It\u2019s time to start a family with him (with or without kids) and living with YOUR morals and views. The wedding is the beginning of that life with him and it\u2019s about you and him, not your family. It\u2019s about you two having a good time with people that you feel comfortable with. If your family doesn\u2019t want to accept that you can have your own thoughts and decisions (especially as a grown person) then they shouldn\u2019t wonder about getting uninvited.", "NTA.\nand I would love to hear how they the story how the missed their daughter\u2019s wedding because some guy was wearing a dress.", "NTA \n\nThis is so clearly just a declaration of boundaries. You told them that you were going to allow Theo at your wedding and they told you they weren\u2019t coming.", "At this point I would probably cancel the wedding and get married at city hall with Theo and one nonjudgmental friend as witnesses.", "NTA - they gave you an ultimatum over a man wearing a jumpsuit. That's incredibly stupid. If they choose not to come because you don't force people to conform then that's their problem.", "Absolutely NTA. Your wedding, your guests, your free will and theirs too", "if there was ever a hill to die on this is definitely it. NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is hard for me to hear though. I can't imagine my family not being present at my wedding, whatever the reason. You have made your stance known, however, and I applaud you for that.\n\nI don't know where you're at and what culture you're from, so I don't know if Theo and you and fianc\u00e9e are being especially brave, or your family is being especially conservative, but either way - I admire your decision.\n\nMy guess is that they will actually come, when it comes down to it. If not, I would take that as a hard wake-up call.", "NTA. Hateful bigots shouldn\u2019t get invites to anything.", "NTA at all. You did nothing wrong.\n\nThis wasn't really about Theo anyway, this was all about their beliefs and their butthurt feelings after they realised you're not a fellow bigot.\n\nHave a lovely wedding, and congratulations!", "NTA, they\u2019re being super rude.\n\nAlso I think what you described is a jumpsuit", "NTA. Theo wore a jumpsuit. Made in denim without sleeves would be farmers\u2019 bib overalls, made \u201cfor men\u201d for the last hundred years.", "NTA this is perfect opportunity to start the rest of your life without those grey clouds slowing you don't.\n\nHave a great day I'm sure theo will enjoy it too.", "Agreed. Theo sounds like a keeper. Family sounds terrible.", "This is a great point. As the host of the event it\u2019s your responsibility to take action when one guest is mistreating another like this. If you allow this sort of abuse it\u2019s as good as if you did it yourself.", "Theo took the high road when he didn't want to get in between OP and her family, which I think is an act of grace on his part. OP said nothing about uninviting or going NC/LC, this is 100% on them. NTA.", "It's ok in my life man.\n\nI didn't even tell my family when or where my wedding was.\n\nI barely speak to them and when I do, I barely manage to be civil.\n\nI have friends I tell things that my family will never know", "OP remind Theo of this!!!", "Except in both of those cases it\u2019s chosen family, not biological, with the exception of Dom and Mia in Fast.", "If I could cry over Charlotte\u2019s Web and believe a spider could love a pig, why wouldn\u2019t I believe that human beings can love\u2026 each other?  Didn\u2019t matter if he was dressed with a cape or in street clothes, Clark Kent was still Superman, still a fundamentally decent person.  \n\nSmall minded people need a different book club, all I\u2019m sayin\u2019.", "Haha that's what I mean. I can understand the confusion, but I think given the two franchises that I used as examples, that would have been clear.", "[rip Steve the pencil](https://youtu.be/z906aLyP5fg)", "STEVE!!!!  \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2d"]}
