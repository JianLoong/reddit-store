But since a lot of people seem to have a problem with it I decided to get outside perspective. Names are changed and I'm deleting this account after a while.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 Mark has a bff Theo. Theo likes wearing female clothes. He won't wear it to work or anything, but if the host/hostess allows he will wear it to special events. He's also androgenous so he slays the look. He asked if he could wear a dress to my wedding and engagement and I agreed.\n\nHe wore a thing (I forgot what its called (I'm an immigrant from a not english speaking country) but its the pants that's attached to a top) to our engagement party and the whole party I noticed that my family was giving him weird looks and outright glaring at him/passing hidden rude comments.\n\nThey sat me down after and told me that it was weird that Theo was wearing something feminine and asked me if he was going to do the same at my wedding and I told him yeah he's going to. They asked me f it bothers me and if Mark pressured me into letting him wear the clothes. I tell them no he didn't I let him with my own free will. And then they told me that if Theo is coming they won't come. So I tell them don't come.\n\nNow they are mad that I didn't uninvite Theo and won't talk to me. They also insulted Theo calling him slurs which is when I totally uninvited them.\n\nA lot of people are telling me that I'm making a huge mistake uninviting him. My fiance is on my side but he wants me to think about it. Theo says while he appreciates me standing up for him but he doesn't m to lose my family over him.\n\nI feel like this is as people say my hill to die on. I was already expecting it and I am fully prepared to cut them off because I don't like their racist views. This would also have happened if I had made a LGBT friend and introduced them to my family.

This is not about the dress, or Theo, or even your wedding. As you said, you alredy don't like their racist views. Being racist, homophobic, mysoginistic are traits often normalized in our society and we have to put a stop to it. It was bound to happen if they went on with this views.", "> they told me that if Theo is coming they won't come. So I tell them don't come.\n\n\nGood for you.  F em.  We need more people like you to stand up for what's right.\n\n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nThose people demanded that your wedding suit their narrow views. Nope.", "NTA\n\nSorry this is happening. Stick to your values. You'll definitely get some \"YTAs\" because \"family comes before the friend\" but this ain't about that.\n\nIts your wedding and they gave you that ultimatum and wanted to control who attends cause it made them feel weird to look at. Insulting you for supporting your friend IS worth the uninvite.\n\nFamily shouldn't ALWAYS come first. Sometimes family fucking sucks.\n\nGood luck, I hope your wedding is beautiful!", "NTA\n\nI think it's the hill to die on, too.\n\nTheo's choice of clothes isn't harming **anybody**. Your family is free to not like it, but being manipulative and using slurs is unacceptable because those things **do** harm others.\n\nI can't stress this enough:  they actively chose to do and say things that hurt other people (including you), about a situation that doesn't hurt anybody. That is not ok.", "NTA. as sad as it is, i agree this is a hill to die on. prolly they will make a half assed apology though and show up at the wedding anyway.", "NTA.  You'll be better off in the long run without your family and their toxic beliefs and behavior.  \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA.  They are being ridiculous.", "Nta, you guys don't see eye to eye, and you are making a stand. You aren't uninviting them because of Theo. You are uninviting them because of their views. Even if Theo isn't at the party, their views remain the same", "NTA- anybody giving you ultimatums on YOUR wedding day can kick rocks.", "NTA\n\nYour family is absolutely transphobic. They made a demand \"him or us\" and found out you have zero tolerance for their bs.  \"Fuck around and find out\" and all that.\n\nside note: sounds like he wore a jumpsuit to the engagement party.  They are considered \"feminine clothing\"", "NTA, your parents decided they would prefer not to see a man in a romper than come to your wedding, that's entirely on them.", "NTA\n\nThere is a saying\u2026 what do we call someone who sits with a table full of Nazi? \n\nA Nazi. \n\n\nIt\u2019s normal that you do not want to associate with people who do not share your values. Blood or no blood.", "NTA - Why the hell does it bother them what someone else chooses to wear? No one is forcing them to look.\n\nThey issued an ultimatum because they wanted to strongarm you. Their attempt at bullying failed. Now you all have surprised Pikachu faces and are mad it didn't work.\n\nThey had choices. They chose badly. They likely *still* have 2 choices they can make (if you allow it): 1. they can get their act together, apologize for their behavior, attend the wedding **and BEHAVE during it**, or 2. they can stay home.\n\nIf they do come (invited or not) I would absolutely have someone (or 3) ready to remove them if they misbehave. Their actions need to have immediate consequences.", "NTA. Theo respectfully asked you and you said yes. End of story. I mean they hate this man wearing a dress so much that they are willing to miss your wedding, that says a lot about the type of people they are, IMO. As far as you losing your family over this, I think this is on them, NOT you. This is their hatred keeping them from you.", "NTA. Your wedding, your decission. If your famliy makes you feel unconfortable or you don't like their view on things, you don't have to invite them.\n\nBut yeah as your fiance said, think about it, if you really want to do this (no judgment here, just saying). Uninviting your family from your wedding will most likly mean to be cut off by family and to cut off family. If this is okay for you (because you don't like their racist and homophobic views or also because of any other reason) no problem and definitly still NTA.

It\u2019s just some fabric it\u2019s really not a big deal, I\u2019ll never understand why people are such sticklers about clothes. Like you\u2019re telling me a dress is inherently feminine, no it\u2019s a few pieces of fabric, it isn\u2019t sentient it doesn\u2019t have social constructs, it\u2019s just some fibers weaved together. \nEnjoy your wedding without your bigoted family.", "NTA it's your wedding, not theirs.  Your family played a game of chicken and lost. Have a nice wedding.", "You didn\u2019t disinvite anyone.  They said if a guest wore something that they wouldn\u2019t come.  Cool.

That was your hill to die on and you made your choice.", "NTA - but consider that your friend doesn\u2019t want to be in this position. I know it\u2019s not their fault but the fault of your bigoted family - I just wonder if your friend is unhappy with being the spark of the breach with your family.\n\nYou are absolutely right to make a rule that bigots aren\u2019t allowed.\n\nMaybe your wedding will be happier without them attending.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
