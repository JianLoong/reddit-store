My ex and I split up a little while after my daughter was born. I never expected to be a father. I do love my daughter deeply but to this day I still have problems coming to terms with being a father, and envying my life before. I see my daughter mostly just on Christmas and her birthday. I\u2019m not a very involved parent, in my defense I live an hour and a half away and work 6 days a week.\nWhen my daughter was 5 she was diagnosed with cancer. She\u2019s been in treatment and doing chemo for the past 2 years. Thursday was her bell ringing ceremony, she was cancer free and in remission.\n\nWell Tuesday night my girlfriend was in a wreck. She\u2019s been in the hospital since. I spent all day with her everyday, she has no family, she was scared. My ex had told me the ceremony was Thursday and I was fully planning on going, I had even bought her a doll as a surprise. I was not expecting my girlfriend to be in a wreck, and I would\u2019ve had to drive nearly 2 hours to get to my daughters ceremony. I figured my daughter had my exes side of the family there and my parents, she wouldn\u2019t even notice I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI was wrong, 2 hours after the ceremony I get a text from my ex cursing me out saying my daughter was looking for me and asking my parents when I\u2019d be there. After she cried. My parents ended up taking them out to celebrate and asked if I could make it. \n\nI couldn\u2019t make it, they just took my girlfriend back for a small operation on her leg and I needed to be there for her. I tried to explain this to my ex but she said my daughter needed me too and this was a very special day for her, and I should be thankful I have my daughter here still. It\u2019s days later, my parents are upset with me, and I FaceTimed my daughter and she cried and said she missed me and asked if I could come see her. I worked this weekend so I feel like the biggest jerk. But I couldn\u2019t just leave my girlfriend here alone.", "created_utc": 1676840407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116ntaq/aita_for_missing_my_daughters_cancer_free/", "score": 1555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m betting ZERO. \n\nWho knows if your girlfriend will still be with you 20 years from now, but I promise your daughter will still remember your choice here. \n\nYTA for so many reasons from your limited presence in her life to your total disregard for your daughters journey. If your girlfriend can\u2019t see that your child should be prioritized FOR A SINGLE DAY, I guess y\u2019all deserve one another. \n\nAlso, you choose where you live\u2014 don\u2019t use it as an excuse on why you are a shitty dad. Take ownership of it.", "YTA. You only live an hour and a half away and you only see her twice a year? That itself is awful.. I feel like you are using your gf\u2019s accident as an excuse. You could\u2019ve still made it to see your daughter..", "Your envious of your life before you barely see the kid so what do you miss exactly?", "YTA. You don\u2019t feel like a father because you aren\u2019t a father. Seeing your daughter twice a year is just\u2026 ugh. Of course she misses you, you have put everything in your life before her. This is just one in a long string of let downs for your daughter. You aren\u2019t a parent.    \n     \nAlso, your girlfriend was two days out from her accident. You didn\u2019t even consider finding a friend to sit with her when you KNEW your daughter\u2019s bellringing was happening.", "YTA. And a big one at that. \n\nI had an absent parent growing up, barely around. Never made time for me. Birthdays, graduation, prom, etc. I always had to give myself a little hug and pep talk to get through it without breaking down into tears. Your daughter had cancer. I couldn't even imagine adding that into the trauma of having a parent that doesn't actually care enough to see you. Let alone for a girlfriend. Your daughter is your blood. If you continue this way your daughter will stop speaking to you permanently just as I have with my mother. \n\nI'd say either fix yourself and step the fuck up to raise and be there for the child YOU made, or do her a favor and completely fuck off. This is my opinion and a strong one, but it absolutely digusts me that you don't feel an obligation to the human you brought into this world. \n\nLastly, how your gf is comfortable being with someone who is an absent parent I have no idea. Red flags everywhere.", "You didn\u2019t even bother telling them you weren\u2019t coming? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA, and you should work on being a better father.  \n\n>I still have problems coming to terms with being a father, and envying my life before.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA. A black hole sized AH. Like a supernova of assholery.", "Still have problems coming to terms with being a father\u2026\u2026 envying your life before what; needing to visit your daughter twice a year?\n\nYour daughter deserves so much better.", "YTA\n\n\"couldn't make it?\" No, you chose not to try.\n\nIts pretty clear that you knew your girlfriend's life wasn't in any danger.  You could have left for a day and it wouldn't have made any difference to your gf.   You missed a massive life event for your daughter.  You will never be able to make up for breaking your promise and breaking her heart.\n\nI feel really bad for your kid because this is going to be a common occurrence in her life, especially if you get married.  You will always choose to put her last.  You will always choose to break your promises.  You will always choose to make excuses.  You will repeatedly choose to be the worst dad possible to her.\n\nHopefully your ex remarries a good man who steps up and is the father you should have been.  Your kid deserves a good dad and you have chosen not to be one.", "YTA, and how.\n\nHad the wreck been Thursday and you'd been rushing to the hospital and missed the bell ringing, then fine. But you had plenty of time and could easily have made it out and back without causing any distress to your girlfriend. Your daughter has had the fight of her tiny little life and you couldn't even show up for the victory lap.", "YTA bc you're an absentee father. Your daughter would probably have been fine not seeing you once due to an emergency if she actually saw you regularly. \n\nBut you see her like twice per year. You've already shown her how much you don't care even about her life or death. \n\nYou live 2hrs away not 10, you can visit more often but you choose not to. Honestly your poor daughter would be better off if she never met you and had no memories of you. \n\nYou see her just often enough that she hurts the most.", "YTA \n\nJust as a side note, my parents are divorced and have been since I was young. My dad has a full time very demanding job and at the time he would pick us up for our weekly visits/weekend visits he lived an hour and a half away. He\u2019d drive to come spend time with us if we even wanted to see him for two minutes. You really suck as a father, you\u2019re more like a sperm donor at this point. Do better, although at this point your relationship with your daughter is probably irreparably damaged.", "YTA. Your daughter should come first and you knew about this in advance. You didn\u2019t think she\u2019d notice but she clearly did. Stick to your word. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be a parent, you should just step out for good and only provide help financially. Going in and out of that child\u2019s life and disappointing her over and over is only hurting her. If you do want to be a parent, you need to step up more and make a greater effort.", "YTA. Unless your GF was in serious or critical condition your choice should have been going to your daughter's celebration. She got over cancer.  This is huge. And you didn't even bother calling her to tell her you wouldn't be there. Double YTA. You don't love your daughter. You resent her for living. You don't even like her. Just pay child support and stay away.", "\"WAHHH I NEVER CAME TO TERMS WITH BEING A FATHER WAHHHHHH\"\n\nGrow up and put your daughter before your immature self. YTA", "YTA. This is why I hate dad's like you. You only pay attention to your love interest and pretend your kid won't care about you being there. Have fun knowing your kid will go to therapy because you are an asshole.", "YTA for not supporting your daughter through her battle with cancer and for assuming she wouldn't miss you at the ceremony. If your girlfriend was not in critical conditon, you should have been able to leave her for the 5 or 6 hours it would have taken for you to go to your daughter.  You don't sound like a very good father, and I feel really sorry for your little girl.", "What, you couldn't even Face Time? YTA, OP.", "YTA. And you don\u2019t deserve your daughter, not like you want her any way.", "YTA. The problem isn\u2019t that you missed this very special celebration for your girlfriend\u2019s unforeseen surgery. The problem is that you never show up for your daughter and while she typically just takes it on the chin, this is the one that broke her heart.", "YTA and honestly if I was your gf I wld have told u to go.  She is a grown adult who can handle being in the hospital alone for a day.  If you don't want to be a father just stop seeing your daughter what you are doing now is just torturing her.  \n\nI mean, and this is gonna sound cold, but wld you rather your daughter hadn't beat the cancer? Because the first part of what you wrote makes it seem like that.", "YTA. You're not this girl's father. Let's be honest, you're a sperm donor that visits from time to time. \n\nI'm sorry your girlfriend was in a terrible accident but unless this surgery posed a serious risk of her losing her life on the table then you should have been there for your daughter. Your girlfriend had a frightening experience where she could have lost her life- you haven't left her side. Your daughter has been fighting to stay alive and finally won that fight (for now) - you felt a 2 hr drive was too much of an inconvenience. You arguably could have gone there stayed and driven back. A 4 hr round trip sucks but it's doable. You could have been there for both of them.  \n\nPlease, either be this kid's father or don't be. It's unfair and cruel to her to keep wondering why she doesn't matter to you. She didn't have a choice when she got you as a father- whatever issues you have about fatherhood are not on her but she sure seems to be paying the price for them.", "YTA. Your Gf is an adult and can handle being in the hospital alone for a couple hours. \n\nAnd living an hour and half away is zero excuse to not be an involved parent. My dad lived an hour and a half away, and spent 3 years driving to see us 2-3 times a week.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is 2 hours away. That means you had until Thursday morning to make sure your GF was stable - over 24 hours from the time of the wreck. And your GF was in stable condition from everything here. Her situation was scary, but not life threatening.\n\nYou also had that 24+ hours to see if a friend or family member could come sit with your GF while you were away. But bottom line, you did not make your child a proirity.", "YTA -  Driving for 2 hours is a mild inconvenience that you could easily have handled if you really wanted to.  It doesn't sound as though your gf was in a life threatening condition and unless that was the case, you should have sucked it up, gotten up early, driven to see your daughter to celebrate her, show up for your ex and the rest of the family and left afterwards to drive back to your gf.  It would have been a long, exhausting day but it was completely manageable. \n\nYou made other people deal with a problem you caused and ruined what should have been a joyous occasion.  I don't know how you fix this.  It's one thing to be an absent parent, but it's another thing entirely to give your child false hope and to let them down with broken promises.", "YTA. You are a sperm donor at this point and not a father, your grown gf was scared? Well I\u2019m sure your child with cancer has been scared the last two years. Honesty at this point just sign your rights away or just be a child support payer because that\u2019s what it sounds like you are already.", " The entire first paragraph makes you an AH.", "YTA, first paragraph makes you an even bigger AH", "YTA, you don\u2019t even need to ask. You chose your girlfriend because it\u2019s easier not having a child. You\u2019re the worst deadbeat ever.", "YTA. Not just for this but for being a terrible father. Loads of us didn\u2019t expect to be or actively choose to be parents but we stepped up and made sacrifices. As for envying your life before - what exactly has changed for you? You\u2019re certainly not parenting your child.", "YTA. Please get a vasectomy so this doesn't happen again. A child knows, even that young, that they aren't a priority and it stays with them. Don't make promises you don't intend to keep. You didn't even have the courtesy to let your ex know the situation so she could prepare your daughter.", "YTA, You sound like a deadbeat dad who only sees his daughter on celebrations.\n\nYour daughter is 7, so you've had plenty of time to get used to being a parent. There's no excuse for how you treat her. There is no 'defense' for your treatment of her. You're lucky your ex lets you have any contact at all by the sounds of it.\n\nYour daughter had cancer FFS, how could you possibly think that anything else is not more important than going to her ceremony? Your kids should always come first.\n\nPlease don't consider having any more kids as you're clearly not cut out to be a parent!", "You feel like the biggest jerk because you ARE the biggest jerk. \nAnd if your girlfriend is OK being with a man who has a child he basically ignores, she\u2019s just as big of an asshole as you are.\n\nYTA does not even begin to cover it", "YTA.  Your poor daughter is apparently going to spend her whole life disappointed by you because you\u2019re just making excuses for not being there for her instead of stepping up.", "YTA. How can someone who only sees their child (their child who was battling cancer, btw) only on her birthday and Christmas still be \"coming to terms\" with being a parent? \n\nYou should've been there for her bell ringing and, at the very least, made some huge effort for the fact that you ended up missing it.", "YTA - you're not a father - but rather a donor at best. I hope your daughter cuts contact when she's old enough to make such a decision. It won't make much a difference in her life seeing as how absent you are anyway.", "YTA,  The  little girl you created, and will always be part of your life  needs your support more than a grown ass woman, who may not even be part of your life in 6 months.", "YTA she just fought cancer and you weren\u2019t there for her because you were with your girlfriend", "Driving an hour and a half is no excuse to not see your child more than a couple of times per year. You should have realized how important she is to you from birth, but the fact that you did not have a major change of heart and in behaviour when she was diagnosed says a lot about you.\n\nYTA. You have missed the majority of your daughter's life so far, so you were the AH long before this. But, missing the most important milestone she has had in her life so far is unforgivable.", "There\u2019s no defence for you at all, just admit you want to be a deadbeat who has no part in her life do she can start dealing with not having a father instead of breaking her heart over and over\n\nYta", "YTA Not just for this but everything. Your 5 year old daughter gets cancer and you were still not all that involved...I take this kinda personal. My sister had cancer at that age too and my dad would spend every night a the hospitals she would never be alone. (He also had a demanding job at the time).\n\nSaying you're yta is just too mild and well I'm not going to say what I really think of you as you don't seem man enough to take it as you're not even man enough for your kid it seems.", "YTA - it\u2019s not even just that you didn\u2019t show up this one it\u2019s that you never bother to show up and it doesn\u2019t seem like you called or texted to let anyone know you couldn\u2019t show up this time either. So, you left a little girl expecting you\u2026 again. I mean if you were 14 I might give you a bit more of a pass on the I still have issues being a father thing you have going on. However, your 29 you were 22 when she was born get over yourself.", "YTA, a shitty sperm donor and a shitty human being. Your girlfriend is also shit cause there is no way in Caesar's ghost that I'm dating a man who neglects his kid.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t think she would notice that you weren\u2019t there? \n\nShouldn\u2019t you WANT to be there? Isn\u2019t that ceremony important enough to leave your adult friend to attend it? You made it very clear what your priorities are.", "YTA - Either stay out of her life or get engaged in it. This middle ground is bullshit.", "YTA x 1000. Your daughter\u2019s existence pains you, and rather than accept your role as parent you find every way to shirk it. \n\nYour gf was in the hospital.  She\u2019s an adult. Your child has crossed a major milestone in recovery. The fact that you blow it off is a demonstration of your character. If you feel shame, you should. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re dead inside and I pity you.", "YTA. You\u2019re going to lose all contact with that kid if you don\u2019t start making her a priority. I\u2019m sorry your girlfriend was injured but you were able to drop everything to be with her and you see your daughter who just finished cancer treatment twice a year? An adult can spend a few hours in the hospital alone so that you can prioritize your child for one freaking day.", "YTA. Let me reiterate the reasons for you.\n\n1. Your 7 year old baby girl just got a new lease on her life and you weren't there to celebrate that moment with her. I kid you not, she will definitely remember this for the rest of her life and she will resent you for this. \n\nDo you even know how hard it is even for an adult to go through chemotherapy and fight cancer? Your daughter just did that and I can't even imagine all the pain that little girl went through. At the very least, you could have celebrated her special moment with her just for a couple of hours at least.\n\n2. While it sucks that your GF is going through a hard time, she is an adult and I'm sure she could've handled being by herself for a few hours while you went to see your daughter who just battled cancer. After all, your GF is being cared by trained medical staff!", "YTA\n\nYou know you are, you already said it. You don't want to be a father and now your daughter knows that for sure. Congrats, you've permanently damaged your relationship with her. Maybe she'll even go no contact with you when she's older and then you won't have to pretend anymore.", "YTA", "Small surgery on the leg? Presumably your gf was gonna pull through. Couldn\u2019t even get away to celebrate at a meal? Hard situation. Cancer is the biggest AH. \n\nYou\u2019re still a bad dad. YTA. You had multiple chances to do something, anything. You admit that your gf was having \u201csmall surgery.\u201d Your daughter will never forget this.", "You envy your old life but only see your kid, who has cancer, 2x a year? You SUCK. You don\u2019t deserve your kid. I don\u2019t even know how any woman could be with you knowing how you are to your own child!", "YTA big time. You made your choice, girlfriend over daughter, and the good news is that you will be freed from other parental obligation like high school graduation, walking her down the aisle. Enjoy spending time with your girlfriend", "Okay, I'm gonna be nice... but I'm still calling you TA.\n\nThe thing is, it doesn't matter if you don't LIKE being a Dad -- you, in fact, ARE a Dad. You're gonna screw up your daughter mental health if you keep putting yourself and your needs before the human you created. You have a responsibility towards that kid; she didn't ask to be born. \n\nPlease seek mental health services. Resenting your own child is toxic.", "You my friend are heartless. Your daughter was celebrating being cancer free, and you had to stay with your girlfriend because she was having MINOR surgery on her leg? You're beyond asshole. You're mom and dad must be proud of you. Incentive and self absorbed doesn't come close to describing this.", "YTA. But reading your post you've been one all her life, you might be a father, but not \"her father\" if you can take days off for cancer survivor child I don't see when you will do anything for her, I only hope that poor girl wake up form the delusion that you care about her and leave you behind as you have done to her. Shameful.", "YTA in regards to this situation. \n\nYTA in general.", "YTA! You clearly don\u2019t love your daughter. Can you fake your own death? She\u2019d be better of not knowing how disappointed you are that she lived.", "YTA.\n\nYou owe your daughter a better father Jesus Christ.", ">in my defense I live an hour and a half away\n\nDude, I drive an hour and a half just to go to a nicer grocery store.  YTA", "YTA kids come first no matter what. wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she grows up hating your stupid ass also don\u2019t go sticking your dick into women & getting them preggers if you can\u2019t handle being a father.", "It\u2019s \u2018family\u2019 that only turn up on birthdays and Christmas that really ruin birthdays and Christmas. Like why even bother.", "YTA - for not calling. I\u2019m sure she would have understood why you needed to be in the hospital but a phone call wouldn\u2019t have beyond your capabilities.", "YTA and a horrible father. It honestly sounds like your ex got pregnant on accident and you're pissed that you had a responsibility to the child. Not that you act like you care about her.", "INFO, what was the extent of your girlfriends injuries? Was she at risk of dying over the last few days, and you didn't want to risk not seeing her in her last moments? Was it JUST a broken leg and/or arm? Your answer determines my judgement", "YTA. If that were my child, that would be the absolute last time you would talk to her. It\u2019s better to have no father, then one who doesn\u2019t keep their word.", "YTA. THIS IS YOUR DAUGHTER. Dude..I can't even comprehend the level of assholery here.", "YTA. I'm confused how you miss your old life when you hardly are even a father. You literally state you only see her for Xmas and her birthday. \n\nHow is your gf even ok with this. I assume she must not want any kids or this would be the biggest red flag for her. \n\nYour daughter deserves better. She deserves a dad who is actually there for her.  You haven't left your gfs bedside but you were seemingly fine not being at yours daughters while she fought cancer. And that speaks volumes.", "YTA, and I feel like you know that. Listen do all three of you a favor, just stop coming around. The moment your ex gets married, just sign your rights away. Because as it currently stands you're not even a weekend dad, your a \"I'll see ya when I see ya kid\" kinda dad. No one deserves that. Just let go.", "YTA. Do everyone a favor and just abandon your daughter. That'd be kinder than stringing her along and letting her believe she has a father who cares about her.", "YTA.  Your kid always comes first. You have now told your daughter that she is less important to you than your girlfriend.", "YTA. You should have been there for your daughter. Kids remember who was with them when it counted and my dude, that wasn't you. Your priorities are messed up. It may be hard for you to be a father to your daughter, but parents do hard things. You are just making excuses for being a crappy dad.", "YTA, major league. Child >> girlfriend.", "YTA. I have never wanted to give a major AH award before but you would win. You don\u2019t ever put ANYONE above your daughter. Yeah your gf was in a car wreck, sad. She\u2019s an adult. She can be alone for half a day while you support your daughter who just finished the hardest fight of her life. Jesus Christ. I cannot believe you. Disgusting.", "YTA & a jerk & a lot of other things & just generally an awful selfish person.", "YTA. I can give you my sperm donors number then you can join his little crap fathers club.

YTA.", "YTA. Hope you tell your girlfriend and she becomes your ex because damn.", "Yta.\nIs it safe to assume your gf is an adult? She can handle being alone for a few hours, yes, even sick.", "YTA. You would have been gone for half a day, not overnight. if you are unwilling to be her father give up your rights and stop stringing her along, it\u2019s cruel and confusing. you prioritized your gf in a way you will never prioritize your kid. shame on you.", "Yta\n\nYou see your kid twice a year and she's within driving distance? And she had cancer?! And yoh couldn't even be there for her when she went into remission? \n\nI dont know why you're missing your old life of not being a father. Cause you aren't one.", "YTA, you are probably the worst type of father there is and your daughter definitely deserves better than you. You live an hour and a half away\u2026. And?? If you really loved your daughter that distance wouldn\u2019t mean anything . \n\nYou\u2019re just gonna keep letting your daughter down every single time she needs you and I will be surprised if she doesn\u2019t go no contact with you when she gets older. If you really value your relationship with your daughter you need to do better. She gets the news she is cancer free and all she gets from you is a little FaceTime? You should have been beside her hospital bed for every single appointment and treatment day as well as be there for her at her ceremony too. Your girlfriend however, needs a little operation on your leg and you didn\u2019t leave her side. Please know that your daughter needed you more than your girlfriend did. Did your girlfriend not tell you to go to your daughter instead?", "YTA and a disgusting excuse for a father.", "YTA and from the sound of it, too much of AH to ever come back from. Any time you feel the slightest happiness with your girlfriend, I hope you remember the child you brought into this world and think of all the times she was probably sitting in the hospital, throwing up from the chemo, feeling too weak to move, over TWO YEARS, just wishing her dad was there. Become a man who *deserves* his child or terminate your parental rights so this poor little girl never has to get her hopes again. Fear of the cancer returning will be burden on enough on her through her life, she doesn\u2019t need a deadbeat dad on top of it.", "[deleted]", "YTA you\u2019ve done more damage to your daughter in this instance then it sounds like that wreck did to your girlfriend. You are literally the worst kind of father, the kind who says they will be there but isn\u2019t. Stop giving her false hope, just pay your support and leave her alone. Also pay for her therapy since you\u2019re the reason she\u2019ll need it.", "YTA do better.", "YTA. And if your girlfriend knows you did this and didn\u2019t have a problem with it then she\u2019s an AH too. I cannot in a million years picture supporting a father who\u2019s not very present to begin with missing something so important. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say to someone who doesn\u2019t take the miracle that is their child to heart.", "YTA. Either be all in for your daughter or do her a favor and leave her alone.", "This is rough, because while you are being supportive of your girlfriend in a difficult situation, you are being really shitty to your daughter who is very young and had cancer. Your girlfriend is old enough to understand the situation, but your daughter is not. I feel like the right thing to have done would have been attending the ceremony for your daughter even if only for a short time before going back to your girlfriend. \n\nYTA for not trying harder to be there for your daughter on a very important day for her. I think you should set aside time to do something special for her, so you can celebrate this important milestone with her, and give her the doll you were planning on surprising her with.", "YTA. Your gf is an adult who can handle being alone at the hospital and in any case you've been with her in the hospital since her accident and of course you will return to her there.

You coulda been on video call with daughter to see from afar. You could thrown your own daddy daughter celebration to make up for it.

My ex and I split up a little while after my daughter was born. I never expected to be a father. I do love my daughter deeply but to this day I still have problems coming to terms with being a father, and envying my life before. I see my daughter mostly just on Christmas and her birthday. I\u2019m not a very involved parent, in my defense I live an hour and a half away and work 6 days a week.\nWhen my daughter was 5 she was diagnosed with cancer. She\u2019s been in treatment and doing chemo for the past 2 years. Thursday was her bell ringing ceremony, she was cancer free and in remission.\n\nWell Tuesday night my girlfriend was in a wreck. She\u2019s been in the hospital since. I spent all day with her everyday, she has no family, she was scared. My ex had told me the ceremony was Thursday and I was fully planning on going, I had even bought her a doll as a surprise. I was not expecting my girlfriend to be in a wreck, and I would\u2019ve had to drive nearly 2 hours to get to my daughters ceremony. I figured my daughter had my exes side of the family there and my parents, she wouldn\u2019t even notice I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI was wrong, 2 hours after the ceremony I get a text from my ex cursing me out saying my daughter was looking for me and asking my parents when I\u2019d be there. After she cried. My parents ended up taking them out to celebrate and asked if I could make it. \n\nI couldn\u2019t make it, they just took my girlfriend back for a small operation on her leg and I needed to be there for her. I tried to explain this to my ex but she said my daughter needed me too and this was a very special day for her, and I should be thankful I have my daughter here still. It\u2019s days later, my parents are upset with me, and I FaceTimed my daughter and she cried and said she missed me and asked if I could come see her. I worked this weekend so I feel like the biggest jerk.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As it is, you only see her twice a year by your own admission, so \"not very involved\" is an epically gross understatement. She sees the cashier at the local grocery more often than you. That's not \"not very involved\" you are totally completely wholly uninvolved to the point that I actually don't get why you were even invited to the celebration. \n\nBased on your post, it doesn't even sound like you were there for her during chemo. If your gf would have been in any way mad at you for celebrating the fact that your child is still alive, she would be as big an asshole as you are. I think the biggest favor you can do your daughter at this point is to forfeit your parental rights and exit her life as completely as you can.

What kind of person is the GF if she did not urge him to go to the ceremony?", "By this I assume he meant before he had to pay child support.", "He probably means he misses living without the guilt of being a shit dad", "I also laughed at his excuse of being 1  1/2  hours from her......what a crock. That is not a far distance.....he could do it at least once a week. He  should disappear from her life for her sake.YTA", "I asked the same!", "Legit knew a chick that would complain about how much her fianc\u00e9 cared about his \u201cstupid kid\u201d, and \u201cruined\u201d their time together when it was his custody week because she didn\u2019t have his full attention. The fit this grown ass \u201cwoman\u201d threw when he took them both to Disneyland instead of just her. \nDidn\u2019t know the dude at the time, but told him anyway. He had no idea she felt that way and ended things with her.", "That is a strong possibility.  We don't have any basis for saying anything against the girlfriend.  She is in the hospital and (presumably based on my experiences) on pain meds and pretty focused on her own needs right now, which is fair.", "If my partner told me this I would be so perplexed as to why he was not fighting tooth and nail to get full custody from the crazy lady. \n\nMore likely she doesn't want to date a single father (which in and of itself is fine) so she is ok with him being a deadbeat dad.", "YTA\nThis guy is the type who will 100% have a pack of kids with his immature fiance and vow that this family will be his do-over family, until he fucks off outta there and goes on to repeat the cycle with another dumb dumb. God what a piece of work.", "I feel dreadful for the child, already scarred by his cruelty.", "but...why? surely you're paying more in gas than saving the $10", "Wouldn\u2019t you be spending the money you saved on gas though?", "It just wore us down to the point where I\u2019d fucking cry every time this happened, so we knew it was time to get out. It was so emotionally draining.\n\nWe went into it thinking, if there\u2019s any problems, it will be the child acting out or not trusting us because they get moved around so much but no. Forcing these kids to go thru this was horrific, especially the younger ones that hadn\u2019t had time to grow a hard shell and \u2018not care\u2019.\n\nThe kids who we had for longer periods, you could see the initial excitement at the thought their parent would be coming tomorrow gradually erode away until they didn\u2019t even react if the parent turned up, or not, they get to the point where they don\u2019t care either. It\u2019s harrowing to watch.\n\nWe had our own kids so adopting wasn\u2019t an option (Australia).", "Yeah if for some reason he wasn\u2019t an AH for the situation in this post he\u2019s definitely an AH in life period.", "Let's try and hope for the best.", "I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't visited her during her chemotherapy treatment days", "No, you don't undertand! He would have to druve 2 whole hours! That's an impossible ask!!!  No sane person could expect that \\s\n\nYTA and I hope your daughter gets therapy to get over what your behaviour did to her when she is old enough", "You\u2019re right. And that\u2019s just so freaking sad for that angel.", "Bingo. The daughter is a small child who likely could have died.  But hey, the adult girlfriend got in an accident where there was no risk Of death (I can\u2019t imagine that would have been left out if there was) and she needed someone to hold her hand. Surely that is more important \ud83d\ude44. \nThis is one of those posts where I have to fight saying something that may result in a ban. As a parent, I\u2019m fuming.", "Oh, but he'd have a REALLY long drive to get there... Heaven forbid her needs inconvenience him in any way. And yes OP, you're a tremendous AH.", "According to OP\u2019s post, it was minor leg surgery so NOT understandable in any way, shape, or form. If it was cardiac or neurological surgery or something else life threatening the *maybe* understandable but not this.\n\nEdit: fix a word", "And yes, support the girlfriend but surely he could take a couple of hours away from her and she wouldn't break.", "Makes you wonder how many times the daughter was in the hospital during her fight with cancer and scared and wanted her daddy there with her too and how many times times OP actually showed up if any.\n\nIt's been 7 years now. If you're still \"not sure\" about being a dad it's actually you're not actually wanting to be a dad but know that saying it will cause backlash with family and want to keep one foot in the door just in case things turn out well with the kid.", "Yup. I\u2019m having (planned) surgery. Timing sucks and my husband can\u2019t be there, he has to take care of our kids. \n\nI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t want to do it by myself. But I will, because the kids can\u2019t stay by themselves.", "Your gf was at a hospital.  There is no reason for you to be there 24/7 for a hospitalized adult.  You can't leave your gf alone - please, a grown woman can handle being alone.  I shudder to think what would happen to your daughter if something happened to your ex and you were her sole parent.", "I mean he didn\u2019t mention ages\u2026 so could be a weird age gap", "He doesn't mention paying any CS. I think he would mention if he did, as another way to make himself lood good. \"I see her twice a year, but i pay lots of money for her clothes and food\". He even mentioned buying her a doll.", "Good for you! If you see something say something.  You saved the child from an evil stepmom.", "She\u2019s dating a deadbeat dad.", "Maybe he has a Prius and buys like 20 cartons at once. \n\nMaybe he smokes 5 packs a day. \n\nSo many questions.", "Completely", "I hope she has a good male role model, too. Because if her dad can't be bothered to go to such a major milestone, then he'll likely never show for the smaller ones. Her graduation? He has to work. Her wedding? His gf has a cold. Grandkids? They live too far away.", "His child faced death and survived, so many parents would give anything to trade places with him.", "Come on, we can call him an asshole all day long without downplaying the girlfriend's accident. An accident requiring surgery isn't a small thing.", "MAYBE understandable if it was life threatening? \n\nLook, I completely agree with your judgement here, but if the wife were in serious danger I'd hope OP were there. The child's celebration is important, more important than this accident, but she'll hopefully get more time - letting your partner possibly die alone would be cruel if that was a likely outcome. \n\nIf OP showed that they're a reliable parent (which it doesn't sound like they are), the child would be upset but probably understand. But even then you explain, and if you're just never there anyways that's a whole issue anyways.", "I\u2019m willing to bet he could have asked one of his family members to switch places and keep his girlfriend company for a few hours so he can attend at least part of the celebration with his daughter and his girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be alone", "ah i didnt think it could be saving $10 per pack, yeah that would make sense", "This particular surgery was \u201ca small operation on her leg\u201d. This one by OP\u2019s own words was a small one.", "OP's biggest crime isn't missing the ceremony, it's the fact that he's been absent her whole life. If he had been a present, loving father and this happened I think people would be more understanding of his choice to stay by his girlfriend's side during her surgery. Whether or not that'd make him an asshole would still be up for debate but I think people would be more understanding of why he made the choice he did. But OP hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt.", "Yeah. Possible he\u2019s in NY or CT. A pack there is $10 each. \n\nWhat an expensive habit even discounting the end of life costs.", "And things can still go horribly wrong in a \"small\" surgery, not to mention the trauma of the accident itself.", "I was 21 and had broken my leg and needed surgery. I was alone because my dad didn't even want to take me to the hospital (I had to convince him to drop me off on his way to work in the morning - postponing a day and a half from when I should have gone in since I did it on a Saturday) and my boyfriend had work. It was a little stressful going in for my first surgery ever but I was an adult and I was absolutely fine. The only thing I needed from my boyfriend was for him to bring me burgers because I was starving by the time I got out of surgery and hospital food was insufficient. A child's cancer free celebration absolutely should have trumped a minor leg surgery.", "People underestimate the risks of minor surgery and anesthesia in general. I am chronically ill and occasionally need to go under for operations, and I hate it. There is always a chance you won't wake up.\n\nI know someone who went in for a routine, outpatient operation on their knee and passed away. It was obviously a shock and completely unexpected for the family, but my friend said even the medical staff seemed to be in a state of shock because it was so unexpected. \n\nSurgery always carries those risks. Even minor surgery.", "Yes! Exactly! Not being there for your kid on such a huge day is horrid, but not being there for someone close to you after a traumatic accident is also horrid. There weren't really any good options here, dependent on the GF's emotional state.\n\nBut just flat out no-showing is absolute dickery of the higherst degree."]}
