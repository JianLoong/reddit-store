His name is Frederick. My grandparents got him for me a year ago and paid for everything I needed to get started, but since then I have paid for everything he needs with my own money. I am not exaggerating when I say that I love my snake and consider him part of my family. My mom recently got engaged, and my stepdad-to-be has kids. They are all nice, and we normally get along very well, but we have started to have an issue.\n\nThey are scared of/just don't like Frederick. He is really nice and would never hurt anyone and even looks cute, they just don't like him since he's a snake. When they started coming over a lot, I was just told to move his enclosure into my room. However, now that our parents got engaged, they are going to be moving in with us. My stepbrother is going to be sharing a room with me. He is 11. However, he doesn't want to be in the room if Frederick is in there.\n\nOur house isn't big enough for him to get his own room, his sisters are going to be sharing a room with my sister, my parents have their room, and then we have an office. I offered to move Frederick out of my room again, but that won't work for the other kids. My mom has told me I might just have to let go so that everyone can be happy, but I have refused.\n\nI do not, under any circumstances, want to lose him. My mom said I could get a new snake once I'm old enough to move out and it would only be a few years, Both my stepdad and my mom have offered me money and other stuff to get rid of him or that we could get a different pet, but I have refused to accept that. I don't want to sound spoiled or anything, but I want Frederick and only Frederick.\n\nI feel that if my stepsiblings just gave it a chance and actually tried to get to know him even a little bit, they would be able to live with him, but they just won't. They have decided to not like him and won't let me try to change their minds. I know that they will have to live with us somehow, and this will have to be resolved. I asked other family and my friends, and people are split. So please, am I in the wrong for refusing to budge on this?\n\nEdit: I can't sleep so I will talk to my parents in the morning. It's only been an hour, but you guys already have me seriously considering asking about moving in with my grandparents for the time being, probably just until they can get a bigger house. \n\nI will also ask them about just moving someone into the office or keeping Frederick in there, however since his even being in the house is an issue this might not work. \n\nIf I do move him to my grandparents' house, I would rather be with him. Thanks for all the support you guys have given me, I really appreciate it.

Everyone ?  Apparently not you.    You go from having your pet and a room to yourself. To having to share a room and getting rid of your pet.  How is that gonna make you happy.   Being forced to give him up, will only end up making you resent the new family.  It's going to be enough of a adjustment to be forced to live with 4 new people... And your sister is going to have to have two new people live in her room?   Have the parents really thought about this at all.  Are his kids ok with being smooshed together like this sounds like they need to get a different house before they get married.", "NTA. Ball pythons live a long time.  My son got his almost 20 years ago and it still lives with us.   Giving away a pet is an unreasonable request.  Is there any way the snake could stay with your grandparents for a bit as a last resort?", "Nta : keep your pet. \n\nAlso, your mum having a relationship doesn\u2019t mean you need to have a relationship. Ask to move into the office. \n\nParents forcing step kids to get on is the worst.", "NTA.\n\nI can't blame your brother for not wanting to sleep in the same room as an animal he's uncomfortable with but you shouldn't have to get rid of Frederick.\n\nCan you keep him in the office?\n\nAs an aside- your parents should move the office stuff to their room, unless they constantly WFH it seems ridiculous to have an office when 3 people will be sharing a bedroom.", "NTA.\n\nA pet is a responsibility, not something that you can just get rid of when it stops being convenient. It's a shame your mom doesn't realize that; unfortunately, it seems she values keeping the peace more than keeping a commitment. Keep standing up for yourself and your danger noodle.", "Definitely NTA here.\n\nYour parents suck, and clearly are prioritising the needs of the step kids and their own wants of living together over the needs of the family.\n\nRehoming your pet because of an irrational fear is not okay. Discuss helping the 11yo get over his fear. Buy a lock for the enclosure to show 11yo he can't 'get out' and hurt him etc. My husband was terrified of snakes when I got mine, but I worked with him by getting him to touch his tail etc until he got used to him. Your parents should be supporting you with keeping your pet, not coddling an 11 year old.\n\nAlso, shoving three kids into one bedroom and two kids into another is not okay. Not only is it really selfish of your parents, but where I'm from it's actually not legal.", "NTA. This is your beloved pet, not a replaceable object. Many people who don't like snakes start to like them just fine after actually spending time with one, they can be very sweet creatures. Your new step-brothers owe it to you to *try*.", "NTA a pet is a living creature, you dont just get rid because others are irrational. You love him and he is your family.\n\nThey should soend the money on getting the kids exposure therapy to snakes, or get them used to them gradually themselves. They should compromise and allow him in the office or they need a bigger house.\n\nIts too may kids per room and you will need privacy at 15. Its also too much to share a riom with with strangers joining your family. Its fine if you are 5 not a teenager. Its mad your sister suddenly has to share with two others. This is a failure of your mother and her partner.\n\nThey should wait before marriage and moving together until they can afford to get larger accommodation for all the kids.\n\nGo speak to your grandparents and ask for their help. They got you the snake - they can help you.", "NTA, I hope you can find a solution so you can keep your snake. You shouldn't have to give away your pet just because your step-siblings don't like it. \n\nThis is a tricky one, because when people don't like snakes, they REALLY don't like snakes, and it's not easy to reason with them about it.", "Heck no, I wouldn\u2019t give him away. You have built an attachment to him and he was a gift. You don\u2019t have to give him up. He was there before your step siblings came into your life.\n\nYou are not spoiled because you love your pet. You don\u2019t have a responsibility to make everyone happy because you never will be able to. None of us can. That\u2019s impossible. \n\nDon\u2019t give up your pet. You are not in the wrong for not wanting to give up an animal just because someone else doesn\u2019t like it. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Awwww! My heart breaks for you young man! I just got a dog and I totally understand the bonds that we can share with our pets. Your parents are total AH\u2019s for putting you in a position where you would have to get rid of your pet snake. You should be able to move it somewhere in the house where people can choose or not choose to go. Also, this might be a good time for everyone to get educated about snakes, about the kind of snake you have, and so forth. We are only afraid of snakes because we were once taught to be afraid of them. That just needs to be unlearned. If you can try to work with your parents to do that for everyone, it might work out great for everybody. \n\nI wish you the best of luck young man. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in this position. If they do make you get rid of him, well, maybe he could show up at the wedding, if you know what I mean.", "NTA, and I am **terrified** of snakes. That's your baby.", "NTA. they are moving to a new place and must adapt, it is a gift from your grandparents, it is valuable enough to let it go, besides it is your home, you lived there, you had a way of life.\n\nYou are not going to be happy, and they can wait for you to move out. If they take your pets away from you when they move out, I don't think your relationship with your step-siblings will improve or even start. Tell your parents that they need to learn to deal with it and their decisions.", "NTA and I don't really like snakes that much.\n\nMe with my smart mouth would just be correcting my mom every time she said something asinine.\n\nMom:  OP you  might just have to let go so that everyone can be happy\n\nOP: Oh so you just said you love your new boyfriend more than your children so you are happy to throw out my gift from my grandparents that I love to make your new squeeze happy.  Thanks for being so honest and clearing that up Mom.\n\nMom:  I think it is for the best OP\n\nOP:  Oh, thanks for that honesty Mom - I understand what you are saying.    It would be best for you to make your new squeeze happy by throwing your own kids wishes under the bus.  Thanks for that reminder to be careful with you near traffic Mom.\n\nMom: What do you want to give up that snake?\n\nOP: More than you could afford.\n\nFurther to this OP what do your grandparents think of your Mom being willing to get rid of their gift to you to make her new man happy?  Also why do you have to make the sacrifice in your home? Boyfriend is moving in with his kids, your household shouldn't have to revolve around his wishes for his kids to get all the benefits while you and your sister have to just suck it up.", "This feels more like a post for relationship advice since I can see both sides. From your side Frederick is a beloved member of the family and from your step family side Frederick is nothing more than a snake and of course a lot of people are afraid of snakes. \n\nBut I do want to give you a warning the closer and closer step family comes to moving in the more likely it is they would stop just asking and flat out just rehome Frederick when your at school or something. I would contact your grandparents and explain to them what's going on tell them that your afraid they will take Frederick away by force. While not ideal they might be able to take fredericks enclosure into their house so that at least he would be safe.", "In short, NTA.\n\nI personally don't like snakes, but I don't think you are wrong for not wanting to lose your pet, and you don't have to justify how much you love him. It's your home and it must be difficult to be losing your private space, have new people move in and then potentially be losing your pet.\n\nUnfortunately, if your step siblings can't accept him, as a 15 year old it may be the case that the decision is taken away from you because of  the adult/child dynamic. Which I do not condone, and I am sorry if that does happen.\n\nIs there anywhere Fred could go such as your grandparents? I know that doesn't sound like a great idea, but it may be better than losing him completely. I only suggest it, because it's an option to bot lose him completely if the decision is taken away. \n\nThis whole situation must be incredibly difficult, and I am sorry. I hope you have someone in the real world to talk to.", "Edit: I have been informed that a garage is may not be the best place to house a snake, so maby look for an out of the way corner ov the house to limit your step siblings required interaction with the snake. \n\nI don't think your the AH. If your house has a garage or other such space you might see about moving him there so he's a little more out of the way.", "Not wanting to get rid of beloved pets is reasonable, especially when everything else is changing for you. Could Fredrick go in the office? NTA", "NAH. You're definitely not an AH for wanting to keep Frederick, but I can also kind of see where the rest of your family is coming from. Snakes or other animals are very scary to some people, and it is not really fair to expect them to just deal with it. I hope that you are able to find some solution that allows you to keep Frederick in some capacity. If it does not turn out well, I just hope that you do not resent your family for it.", "NTA, I love how your mum wants you to get rid of your beloved pet \"so everyone can be happy\" except you apparently. Did you point out that you wont be happy at all  if they force you to get rid of him. Could you and fredrick live with your grandparents?\nAlso are we allowed pet tax? I love snakes", "NTA Don't budge! Fight for your boopnoodle!", "I have a genuine, severe phobia of snakes. I realize my fear is irrational and I\u2019ve *tried* to work on it, but I can\u2019t even *think* about snakes for too long without having serious issues. Even so, I feel really bad that you\u2019re being pressured to give up a pet you clearly love. I don\u2019t know if your new stepsiblings are like me or not, because I would not even be comfortable going into your entire home given that a python is there. I lean towards you and your stepsiblings are all not AHs, but your parents are for trying to force you to give up a pet you love and not working to figure out another option.", "This is a really tough situation. I had a ball python, Puzzles, when I was younger. He was awesome. I\u2019m a woman, so it was always kind of a thing that a girl would have a pet snake and most of my friends and family were grossed out by him. He was so sweet and a rad pet. \n\nThat being said, we all have our fears, and it\u2019s also not reasonable to expect someone to live in a room with something they fear. \n\nIs there anyone close to you who could take Frederick in till you move out? Someone who lives near you so you can visit? Maybe at your grandparents?", "NTA. See if you can make a compromise by showing them that there\u2019s no way he can get out on his own and you promise not to take him out if your stepbrother is going to be in the room and you\u2019ll go to the office to spend time with him. Like someone else said, the office crap needs to be moved elsewhere because 3 kids in one room is too much. They need a bigger house if your step siblings are going to be living there full time. It\u2019s ridiculous to not think of those things before they get engaged. Before you decide to tie your lives together, finances and living arrangements are important. 7 people in a 3 bedroom house is going to cause arguments and hurt feelings because someone is going to say something to somebody else and then it\u2019ll end up being the parents taking sides and one kid will yell that they\u2019re not being treated right since they moved in. You\u2019re 15. It\u2019s not fair to expect an older teenager to share with a kid who is just hitting puberty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I was younger my dad had a ball python (named her Boots, inside joke for obvious reasons) but my mom and sister (his step daughter) are terrified of snakes. My parents were separated when my dad got her, so when they got back together it was an issue for my mom and sister. You know what they did? Avoided Boots. They didn't have to clean her cage, feed her, nothing. And it was fine.", "Nta,    maybe contact grandparents  and see if you could move in with them as your mom and new family don't really acknowledge your feelings. The snake is part of you now. You've bonded.", "NTA. I'm not a big fan of snakes myself and I don't know how big he is at this point or how big he will get. Would you be able to do some education for the new kids on ball pythons? People are often afraid of things they don't understand and TV and movies often portray snakes as scary, deadly, evil even? Maybe they have these misconceptions about Frederick? \n\nAlso I'm not sure if you take him out of his enclosure but maybe you put some rules in place around that? Like you will only do it when your new roommate isn't in the room, you put a sign on the door saying Frederick is out and you keep the door closed so roomy doesn't accidentally walk in and get scared? If he really can't sleep with Frederick in your room could Frederick be moved to the office and the new kids just stay out of the office? \n\nAlso are they going to be living with you full time or will they live with their other parent part time?", "NTA, but your mom definitely sounds like one in this case. Even if you can\u2019t give Frederick to your grandparents or move in with them yourself (which, you might consider asking about), I would at least let them know what\u2019s going on. Having adult intermediaries here may help you. It sounds like your mom is really caught in a \u201ckeep the peace while merging families\u201d mindset, which is understandable, but also means she may be overlooking important factors and dynamics. Having a third party involved may help her see these things more, maybe enough to brainstorm solutions (such as the office space situation). \n\nFrederick is valuable to you as a gift and pet you\u2019ve already bonded with and committed to. That\u2019s not replaceable, and getting rid of him will probably cause longterm resentment.
