His name is Frederick. My grandparents got him for me a year ago and paid for everything I needed to get started, but since then I have paid for everything he needs with my own money. I am not exaggerating when I say that I love my snake and consider him part of my family. My mom recently got engaged, and my stepdad-to-be has kids. They are all nice, and we normally get along very well, but we have started to have an issue.\n\nThey are scared of/just don't like Frederick. He is really nice and would never hurt anyone and even looks cute, they just don't like him since he's a snake. When they started coming over a lot, I was just told to move his enclosure into my room. However, now that our parents got engaged, they are going to be moving in with us. My stepbrother is going to be sharing a room with me. He is 11. However, he doesn't want to be in the room if Frederick is in there.\n\nOur house isn't big enough for him to get his own room, his sisters are going to be sharing a room with my sister, my parents have their room, and then we have an office. I offered to move Frederick out of my room again, but that won't work for the other kids. My mom has told me I might just have to let go so that everyone can be happy, but I have refused.\n\nI do not, under any circumstances, want to lose him. My mom said I could get a new snake once I'm old enough to move out and it would only be a few years, Both my stepdad and my mom have offered me money and other stuff to get rid of him or that we could get a different pet, but I have refused to accept that. I don't want to sound spoiled or anything, but I want Frederick and only Frederick.\n\nI feel that if my stepsiblings just gave it a chance and actually tried to get to know him even a little bit, they would be able to live with him, but they just won't. They have decided to not like him and won't let me try to change their minds. I know that they will have to live with us somehow, and this will have to be resolved. I asked other family and my friends, and people are split. So please, am I in the wrong for refusing to budge on this?\n\nEdit: I can't sleep so I will talk to my parents in the morning. It's only been an hour, but you guys already have me seriously considering asking about moving in with my grandparents for the time being, probably just until they can get a bigger house. \n\nI will also ask them about just moving someone into the office or keeping Frederick in there, however since his even being in the house is an issue this might not work. \n\nIf I do move him to my grandparents' house, I would rather be with him. Thanks for all the support you guys have given me, I really appreciate it.

You should be able to move it somewhere in the house where people can choose or not choose to go.

I know that doesn't sound like a great idea, but it may be better than losing him completely.

Snakes or other animals are very scary to some people, and it is not really fair to expect them to just deal with it.

Like someone else said, the office crap needs to be moved elsewhere because 3 kids in one room is too much. They need a bigger house if your step siblings are going to be living there full time. It\u2019s ridiculous to not think of those things before they get engaged. Before you decide to tie your lives together, finances and living arrangements are important. 7 people in a 3 bedroom house is going to cause arguments and hurt feelings because someone is going to say something to somebody else and then it\u2019ll end up being the parents taking sides and one kid will yell that they\u2019re not being treated right since they moved in.

People are often afraid of things they don't understand and TV and movies often portray snakes as scary, deadly, evil even? Maybe they have these misconceptions about Frederick? \n\nAlso I'm not sure if you take him out of his enclosure but maybe you put some rules in place around that? Like you will only do it when your new roommate isn't in the room, you put a sign on the door saying Frederick is out and you keep the door closed so roomy doesn't accidentally walk in and get scared?

Even if you can\u2019t give Frederick to your grandparents or move in with them yourself (which, you might consider asking about), I would at least let them know what\u2019s going on. Having adult intermediaries here may help you. It sounds like your mom is really caught in a \u201ckeep the peace while merging families\u201d mindset, which is understandable, but also means she may be overlooking important factors and dynamics. Having a third party involved may help her see these things more, maybe enough to brainstorm solutions (such as the office space situation). \n\nFrederick is valuable to you as a gift and pet you\u2019ve already bonded with and committed to.

Would it be possible for your sister to move into the office, (or have the new step sisters move if it's larger and good for two), and then keep Frederick in her room for you?  It's not ideal but at least you Frederick would still be there and you can still care for him.  If that's not possible and you cannot move him to another room, Grandparents may be the best choice. I know you don't want to burden them but they love you AND they got you the pet. They would likely be more than willing to help you by caring for him until you can.  You are still a minor and you can't just move out - I don't know if your mother, the custodial parent would allow it.  But you could visit your snake and I'm sure Grandparents would work with you.

It is bad enough that when our organization had a zoo event in which snakes would be in the building I took a day off.

I've always had a phobia with them, will instantly panic if I see one in the wild, get weird with pictures, etc. About two years ago me and my roommate moved in together and he had a pet hognose snake. I wasn't really big on the idea but allowed it. Initially, I was wanting him to keep the snake in his room but between the two bedrooms, his doesn't get any natural light and he allowed me to have the master bedroom that has a ton of natural light. Since he allowed this, I felt it was fair to let him keep the snake in the living room next to the windows.   \n\n\nI was really scared of the snake at a first. Very irrational fear and had to constantly confirm with him the snake has never gotten out. For a good week I was nervous to even walk by that part of the house over it hahah. But I opened myself up to it. I ended up being comfortable to walk up to the enclosure and look at it more. Once I saw the snake up close I felt better and have to admit...he did have a cute face. I would even take photos of it and show people.  \n\n\nNow, I 100% had to be out of the room if he ever took it out which was rare since he would only remove the snake to a smaller tank if he was cleaning. But I got over it. Do I still dislike snakes and have to keep myself from panicking if I see them? Absolutely.   \n\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's YOUR pet who means a lot to you and it's 100% not fair to try and make you get rid of him due to the new step-siblings coming in. They have to make an effort and compromise. Maybe laying some ground rules? No idea if you take him out a lot but that could be something to share with the siblings. Setting up communication that if you want to take him out of the tank and hold him for a bit, you'll let the siblings know so they can avoid the room or something.   \n\n\nThey have to face the fear tbh. It's not like they're going to be required to take care of the snake and hold it. But they gotta compromise. I mean, if myself with a snake phobia can open up and become comfortable with one living in my house and even getting up to the tank and watching him, then your new siblings can do it too.  \n\n\nDefinitely stand your ground.  \n\n\nNTA", "As someone with two snakes specifically royal pythons I hope you don\u2019t give up Fredrick they are the best pets and I couldn\u2019t imagine not having my two with me.

In OP's case the steps are already expecting unreasonable accommodations from OP and his sister. It sounds a bit like his mom's new spouse may be using her, otherwise between the two of them they could afford a bigger place. This is so unfair. I do hope OP's mom gets a clue, or he and his sister can live with the grandparents.", "Depends on the Bundesland and the way they interpret \u201csmall\u201d. But mostly it\u2019s true, you can sneak them. Source: I got clever when my new landlords (in Germany) tried to get rid of my small dog, the old landlord (their relative) allowed us to keep the dog, they tried to get away with a no. Didn\u2019t help that my neighbour had 3, including a very large Lab. In Mexico I know it\u2019s like that because my parents are landlords. They have a strict no pets policy.", "Ball pythons are really pretty small, they only get to a few (2-3) kg in weight and they aren't going to be eating pigs or really anything much larger than a rat. They are harmless to humans. They are native to Africa but have plenty of predators in the states, birds of prey, dogs, wild pigs, even cats/stoats etc would probably take out young ones and eggs if they can get them. And the climate isn't right for them. From all accounts I could find they don't do well enough to have any reproducing wild populations in the states.\n\nAnimal trafficking happens no doubt and is wrong but there are plenty of reputable breeders of ball pythons and they are a well established pet reptile species.", "Yeah, for three kids to share a room it's gotta big a big bonus room-type room, not a standard issue bedroom.", "I have 2 ball pythons. They are very timid and sweet.  There are plenty of places throughout the word that breed captive ball pythons, so they are not taken from the wild any longer. They live up to 30 years with good care, so it is not unusual to find someone ready to sell a mature one. I got mine when my children were in grade school. The kids friends that were originally afraid of the snakes were usually holding them by the 3 visit. I have sheets of.paper I can put over their aquarium if I have a visitor that is phobic, although the snakes are usually hiding in their rocks during the day.", "Absolutely NTA! You're right, you can't just \"get rid\" of family. \n\nNow show us a picture of Fredrick.", "NTA. I personally do not like snakes and would never have one as a pet, but he is your pet. You should not have to give up your pet just because your stepbrother is afraid.", "NTA. while the child's fear is understandable, your snake is literally in a glass box, frederick isn't just slithering around the house. learning how to healthily handle and deal with that fear while rationalizing your current danger levels is a part of living a healthy life, the world isn't going to ban clowns just because one person is afraid of them", "Nta. \"My mom has told me I might just have to let go so that everyone can be happy\" obviously, everyone else would be happy, you will not be. And you are supposed to be her #1 priority. I would def point that out. I am petrified of snakes but surely they can find a solution. Rather its making your sb at least try to get used to him or having one of you guys sleep in the office (no access during the day, or something. Children should not be expected to make all the sacrifices because their parents cant make it work. Is your bio dad or grandparents an option or can they keep him until you can?", "NTA.", "Animals aren\u2019t just something to \u201clet go\u201d of, they are commitments too", "NTA and I'd suggest a lock on the tank alongside a card within that lists out how to contact you in case they just try and cart the whole thing off. It feels like a ridiculous response as I type it but it also feels ridiculously short sighted on the side of the adults to not consider this. They've shown that they don't understand your attachment to Frederick already. I'd hate for them to jump to the 'they'll get over it' route and try and rehome him without you present.", "NTA. Is there no way for you to keep the snake somewhere else, maybe a shed in the backyard (I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s safe for the snake, so check before you do it), or with your grandparents? Understand that even when you\u2019re an adult and living on your own, not every place will allow you to keep the snake, unless you own the property yourself.", "I'm sorry you are going through this and you are definitely  NTA. I hope you can find a happy resolution and keep Frederick for a long time. \n\nBut I'm absolutely terrified of snakes. I will run on site. I  would never under any circumstance be able to live in the same house as a snake. The thought makes me physically ill so I completely understand where your future step-siblings are coming from \ud83d\ude29 the situation is very unfortunate.", "NTA. Frederick is your family and deserves all the privileges that come along with it. Do what you can to stay together, and I\u2019m so proud of you for reaching out for help about this super difficult situation.", "NTA. Kid is 11, he can get over a pet in a secure cage. I could understand boundaries like not taking the snake out if your soon to be step brother is in the room. But a pet is not something to give up because they are seen as inconvenient. I saw on another post suggesting to tell your grandparents about the situation and see if they can take your snake for a little while till things calm down.", "NTA\n\nThis may be a little inconvenient for both of you, but you and your sister can share your room.  If that is not possible, living with your grandparents might be the solution to this problem.  Sorry your mom is not advocating for you, you should not have to accept the changes in your household by making a great sacrifice.", "Were your mom\u2019s new fianc\u00e9 and his kids homeless?", ">I would raise another concern, and that's how soon Op's mom thinks her 15-year-old is going to be moving out \"just a few years\"\n\nYou are concerned that his mum thinks he'll be going to college after high school?", "I think you\u2019re right and it\u2019s terribly sad and unfair", "NTA at all. If the friend option doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s another option that might work if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s too crazy. Approach the science teachers at your high school and see if one of them will keep it in the classroom for awhile. I\u2019ve been in several science classrooms with resident snakes. Hopefully the living situation will improve if your mother will do the right thing and use the office as another bedroom. It\u2019s crazy that she\u2019s not.", "So the 3 girls are obviously moving into the master bedroom, right? RIGHT??", "NTA", "Tell your mum what she told you. She can get another husband when you have reached 18 and move out. She can let go of current fianc\u00e9", "Info: does ur sister mind fredrick? \n\nNta btw", "Yea at that point of office should be a bedroom. 5 kids in 2 rooms when you have an extra is crazy."]}
