Kid's probably gonna grow up into self-centered PIS if they act like nothing is her fault and she can do whatever she wants. \nYou made a mistake by not telling yours or hers parents right away that she is doing something wrong. Also, it's just piece of cloth, it can be washed or replaced.", "NTA-  7 is old enough to know what they can and cannot do.  You set boundaries, she broke them and ruined something that you treasure as well as violated your space.  Your reaction was justified.  I would recommend telling your aunt and uncle when she is doing things head of time.  I know you said they are terrifying, but you are going to be an adult in a year and will have to talk with terrifying people.", "NTA.  If your parents are on your side, then talk to them about what to do next time.  And, it's absurd that they let your aunt/uncle, one of which is presumably one of your parents' siblings, attack you like that.", "NTA 7 is not too young to be able to listen to basic instructions. It's obvious the child is not being disciplined properly and has their bad behavior excused since she was not worried about consequences for her behavior.", "NTA. She was the one being a brat, 7 is old enough to listen and understand doing what their told", "NTA. It\u2019s natural to get upset. Your aunt and uncle did the same with you and they\u2019re much older so if they think you\u2019re the asshole, so are they.", "Nta. 7 is old enough to understand no means no. You told her multiple times not to enter your room. A little scolding will not kill her, she needs to learn to respect boundaries. She is not a toddler.", "NTA. The 7 year old is an inconsiderate brat and is being enabled by her lackadaisical parents. \"Only *n* years old works for pre-schoolers, not older children. Unless she is mentally handicapped, she should know about consequences. Clearly, her parents aren't teaching her how to behave.\n\nDo not be afraid of your aunt and uncle for reprimanding their child when they're too lazy to do it themselves . Don't be afraid to tell them that they aren't doing a good job of raising their daughter if she can't understand the word \"no\" by 7 years old, because most kids know that word by the time they're 2 years old. There is nothing they can do to you besides puff up like bullfrogs and make noise ... so what?", "NAH. Your cousin was playing around like kids do and you got mad like kids do.  \n\n\nAn adult response would have been to ask your aunt or uncle to remove their child from your room after you'd already asked her to leave and to stop playing with her slime on your bed.   But you're not an adult, and therefore, not TA for not reacting in an adult way.", "ESH.\n\n\nYou had an opportunity to just go to her parents and ask them to remove her. That's all that should have been required. \n\n\nYou admit that you then harshly and thoroughly scolded a child who is not yours without ever simply telling her parents she was doing something. You were \"too mad to care\" how you made a young child feel and react, that's not cool.", "How old are you?", "ESH. The kid should have respected your wishes. You could have handled yourself more maturely and your aunt and uncle need to teach their child some manners and self-control. You are definitely not innocent here though.", "ESH \n\n* You overreacted because they're just sheets and bedding and can be washed.\n* Yes, your cousin is a child, however at the age of 7, she should be able to follow rules like \"don't go in the bedroom\".\n* Your aunt and uncle are ridiculous for not parenting their kid, and need to back off now that you've apologized.\n\nTalk to your folks before they come back, see if there's a way you can lock your door to keep the cousin out of your room.", "YTA \n\nI understand that children can do things that are infuriating, but scolding is usually a way to vent your own frustrations and is not an effective way to change your cousin her behaviour. At 7 years old most children are quite capable of understanding why they should or shouldn't do some things but you need to explain it clearly and calmly. Explain them why you don't like it when she comes into your room, the slime would be a good example, your privacy concerns also.  Maybe the relationship with your cousin is not ideal at the moment but to prevent similar problems in the future, that would be my advise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While in the same breathe called you a selfish brat and inconsiderate asshole when...in reality...\n\nActing like your child is an angel who can't do no wrongs..because let's be honest 7 is a good age range when the child should know better\n..is how you raise a spoiled child who..doesn't listen at the age of 7! The child should have known better, and it's not like you hit the child...just a good scolding which the child probably needed.\n\n\nEdit: for anyone saying...well he shouldn't have reduced her to tears.. or... are saying well he must have said awful things to upset that child!!....children around that age cry all the time? The moment they don't get their way...they tend to cry like a brat because auntie/mom will always just come fix it for them? ..to make things 'fair'.", "NTA......but you could of asked  her parents to remove her first or your own, can see you apologised and feel bad which shows your character while the childs parents continue to berate you which reveals theirs....I'd move on now you apologised and be happy in the knowledge she very likely won't enter your room again....have a great weekend \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4c", "No, NTA. I do, though, do you all live on one place or did I fail to read that? What I'm trying to get my head around is: if they leave again and your parents stand by you, everything is fine. If you somehow live together it's even more important for your cousin to learn *your words* have to be respected as well.", "NTA but your aunt and uncle are.  She's not spoiled yet, but if they don't know how to guide her to better decisions and listening, she's not going to end up well.", "NTA!   She's absolutely old enough to follow instructions and you told her not to go in there. She gets what she gets. Also sounds like her parents need a reality check or she's going to end up with spoiled little brat.", "YTA. You\u2019re a young adult losing your shit over slime on a bedsheet to the point where you made a child cry.", "YTA. Not cool that she didn\u2019t listen to you, but in this situation you are the adult. You could have handled that much better. \n\nGotta keep your chill.", "She should not have scolded the child to the point of tears.

I really felt bad, but now I'm feeling even worse that they're calling me out.", "I'm 17", "Depending on what materials the slime is made of, some slimes can leave permanent stains. And even if that is not the case, the slime can be difficult to clean.", "Sorry, no. The child was willfully defiant and deserved a scolding. She just learned that not respecting boundaries leads to a negative reaction. This will be more impactful to the growth of her emotional intelligence than any lecture. It's very obvious her parents have been excusing her bad behavior and they are doing a disservice to their child. Not everyone is going to be so patient with her antics and she just learned that. As long as no abusive language was used the parents have nothing to complain about.", "What drivel....it's not OP responsibility to teach a misbehaving child the virtues of right and wrong.......", "Have you ever lost your shit over something in hindsight you thought  was completely ridiculous?", "The kid probably cried because she isn't scolded by her parents. The child's reaction doesn't take away from the fact that OP was completely justified to be angry and reprimand her."]}
