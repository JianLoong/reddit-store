She shouldn't have waited until you showed up, ready to go off on a trip for two. Together, you two could have decided how to handle things. \n\nBut you also didn't need to react like that.

Sometimes shit hits the fan, like when a relative suddenly dies, and you can't dump your kids on anyone last minute. A good parent doesn't compromise their safety so they can go on a couples trip with their unempathetic ~~bf~~ fiancee. This is the reality of having children. You're their lifeline until they don't need you anymore and you either learn to be ok with that as a partner of a single parent or you end the relationship and find someone who's not a parent. You don't expect to be prioritized over the kids.\n\nEDIT: I just realized after posting this that you're not just in a relationship. You're engaged to be married.

You responded to her unilateral decision with a unilateral decision of your own, canceling the trip without the two of you really discussing it.

If you\u2019re going to date a single mother you need to fully understand and accept this. Your reaction to just drive off was extremely childish.

I wouldn't say Y T A for cancelling the trip necessarily, but for how you handled the situation. Just driving off is pretty immature, though I won't say your accusation against her is wrong.

I cant imagine any \"couple's trip\" being viable with two kids in tow. I feel like any expectation of going on a trip for the kids that was dashed by OP was put there by fiancee basically setting him up to fail. I cant imagine any two person booking in a hotel or planned getaway would be able to accomodate two kids at no notice so how was the trip even practical at that point?

I went to pick her up on the day of the trip but was surprised to see my stepkids standing there with her. I was confused til she told me about the situation her ex had. I asked what she was supposed to do with the kids and she suggested we take them along. I refused and reminded her of the kind if trip we planned. She said circumstances \"change\" and she can't leave them behind nor find a babysitter so fast. I decided to just cancel but she begged me. I proceeded to drive off and the trip got cancelled and I went home.\n\n\nShe left me some texts basically blaming me for what I did but I responded that she ruined the trip when she decided to bring the kids. She said those are her kids and I shouldn't expect her not to prioritize them which I respect but that wasn't the point.

Honestly if you don't know why you suck, you shouldn't be getting married to anybody in the first place. What did you think was gonna happen when you decided to date/marry someone with kids?

OP\u2019s PARTNER is giving him shit for being irresponsible herself with notifying him, and with his reasonable response of trying to cancel and reschedule and salvage something, and that makes her the asshole - she should be understanding that her lack of alternative babysitting plans destroyed an adult getaway, and be happy that OP is understanding of why it needed to be cancelled/rescheduled.", "She could have told him when she knew the kids was going to be with her. Instead of waiting until the very last minute to pressure him into taking the kids as well. Unexpected stuff happens all the time, being able to communicate it is what she failed to do. She could have easily sent him a text or called him to tell him about the death in the kid's father's side of the family. Which would have avoided the entire situation.\n\n I had a situation close to this come up this weekend, as the person that was going to watch my kids while I had a couples night out went to the hospital. As soon as I found out I texted my girlfriend and we redid our plans.\n\n Communicating the unexpected situations life throws at everyone is something that is required to building a relationship. He could have stayed and talked it out, sure. However, she didn't include him in the choice of the kids coming along as well. Maybe he planned such a couple's night that included places not suitable for young children (like a restaurant called Better-Than-Sex.) We don't know.", "We don't know why she didn't, though. Maybe there was a reason. Sounds like OP was so upset he might not have listened anyway.", "He didn\u2019t mention how much time mom had the kids before, so it might have been easier for her to just talk to him in person.", "She could have told him before hand that's the issue here and if he planned a couples trip that means he probably didn't book rooms etc for the kids I would have cancelled too", "This. I hope people understand OP should not be required to go on a trip with the kids are included. He never mentioned that he hates the kids or doesn't hang out with them. The fact that she randomly tried to include them last minute is ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "She needed to tell him before she showed up so they could figure out if they need to reschedule or change the vacation plans.\n\nShe was TA for just assuming that how she wanted to handle it was the only way and to not even give OP a heads up or discuss the change in plans firat is incredibly rude.", "If it was short enough notice that she couldn\u2019t find a sitter maybe she didn\u2019t have time? Like people see the kids being packed as evidence she had plenty of time but the kids could have been packed to go to Dad\u2019s", "Exactly. An ambush to guilt him into a family trip. She's awful.", "It sounds like they both wanted alone time together. What do you think she did? Conspired the death of her ex\u2019s family member so she could have her kids??? Life happens and maybe she didn\u2019t have time to talk to him about it and assumed since they are getting married and her kids are his kids that it would be okay.", "Yes she should have communicated but it also could have happened very suddenly and she might not have had time? Also if I\u2019m marrying someone with kids then they will never be \u201csprung\u201d on me. He\u2019s a parent now and unexpected shit happens and you gotta roll with it. Both of them may have been able to handle it better, but he just sounds like he straight doesn\u2019t like her kids.", "Alright but OP is planning to marry her and is specifically using language that separates her own kids from himself. How do you plan to marry somebody when they have two whole kids you don't want to be a part of? What kind of step-dad will he be when it's exclusively \"her kids\" and not \"the kids.\" ESPECIALLY when he's willing to drive off and reject them to their faces.\n\nSure, the mom not informing anybody was shitty but I get the vibe this engament won't be working out well to begin with.", "What that someone died abd the ex couldnt take the kids? Maybe 2 weejs notice of intent to diethat would work i guess", "I'm a mum aswell and i think nta. She didn't need to find a sitter she needed to inform him as soon as her plans changed to having the kids. Not try pressure him with them. And yeah it's hard to find a sitter it's also hard to last minute change accomodations. The try was a couples romantic get away not a family trip.", "Yeah poor Kids, all she had to do was to call him", "Also, where were the kids supposed to sleep? They probably booked a room with only one bed!", "Yes, but it takes far longer to pack for 2 kids than 15 minutes. There was time to text/call. ESH", "It's in the OP.  OP suggested to reschedule, she begged to include them.  OP left.  \n\nWhat else could OP do?  The option was be manipulated into a literal last minute change, or argue about it in front of the kids. \n\nWhere are you getting that she was willing to compromise?  I see that no where. It was hey, me and the kids are ready to go on our trip. Who the fuck does that?", "That doesn\u2019t change anything.  My point still stands that she should communicate instead of manipulate.  Who likes being caught off guard.\nThe whole ask for forgiveness later mentality is so toxic.\nNo healthy relationship lasts without good communication.", "The real AH here is the person who died unexpectedly and spoiled OP\u2019s child-free vacation! /s", "That is fair, but also it could have happened so fast she might not have been able to? You never know\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah she should have but it could have all happened so fast she might not have had time.", "Fair. They could have both handled it better", "It definitely doesn\u2019t say much for their relationship. Not saying he\u2019s TA but should not be with someone with kids if this is his reaction.", "Call him NTA all you guys want. Sounds like he's now NTA without a fiancee lol. Relationships aren't business relationships. Sometimes you just have to give, roll with it. Demanding someone else choose you over their kids is almost always gonna get you booted.", "A text or call takes seconds. It seems highly unlikely it happened in the literal minute or 2 before op picked her up and even then expecting him to just take them without even discussing isn't right. It's unlikely the plans will fit children without change since it's a couples trip.", "You keep making it about the death in the family and plans changing. That\u2019s not the problem. From his post he had no problem with cancelling the trip. There is nothing that you can say that indicates that she didn\u2019t have time to send a text letting him know that plans changed. Also parents are allowed to want to engage in child free activities. She was being manipulative because she still wanted to go. That\u2019s not fair to him.", "We don't know enough honestly but it seems like she didn't tell him so he would just go along with it. That's my thoughts at least.", "Your partner's on their way to pick you up to leave in, say, 20 minutes for a trip booked for 2. You get a call right then from your ex that, say, his mom has died and he can't take the kids. The normal response is not to immediately get your kids packed to go with you and your partner without any discussion or negotiation.\n\nThe lack of logic behind her response does not change with the amount of time between knowledge of the death and OP's arrival.", "Ig I didn\u2019t see that side of it before, both could have handled it much better", "They may have already been packed with bags from going to their dads. Either way I think they both could have handled it better. To me it just sounds like he straight doesn\u2019t like her kids or expect them to be his issue"]}
