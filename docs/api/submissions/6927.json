She shouldn't have waited until you showed up, ready to go off on a trip for two. Together, you two could have decided how to handle things. \n\nBut you also didn't need to react like that.

Sometimes shit hits the fan, like when a relative suddenly dies, and you can't dump your kids on anyone last minute. A good parent doesn't compromise their safety so they can go on a couples trip with their unempathetic ~~bf~~ fiancee. This is the reality of having children. You're their lifeline until they don't need you anymore and you either learn to be ok with that as a partner of a single parent or you end the relationship and find someone who's not a parent. You don't expect to be prioritized over the kids.\n\nEDIT: I just realized after posting this that you're not just in a relationship. You're engaged to be married.

You responded to her unilateral decision with a unilateral decision of your own, canceling the trip without the two of you really discussing it.

If you\u2019re going to date a single mother you need to fully understand and accept this. Your reaction to just drive off was extremely childish.

I wouldn't say Y T A for cancelling the trip necessarily, but for how you handled the situation. Just driving off is pretty immature, though I won't say your accusation against her is wrong.

I cant imagine any \"couple's trip\" being viable with two kids in tow. I feel like any expectation of going on a trip for the kids that was dashed by OP was put there by fiancee basically setting him up to fail. I cant imagine any two person booking in a hotel or planned getaway would be able to accomodate two kids at no notice so how was the trip even practical at that point?

I went to pick her up on the day of the trip but was surprised to see my stepkids standing there with her. I was confused til she told me about the situation her ex had. I asked what she was supposed to do with the kids and she suggested we take them along. I refused and reminded her of the kind if trip we planned. She said circumstances \"change\" and she can't leave them behind nor find a babysitter so fast. I decided to just cancel but she begged me. I proceeded to drive off and the trip got cancelled and I went home.\n\n\nShe left me some texts basically blaming me for what I did but I responded that she ruined the trip when she decided to bring the kids. She said those are her kids and I shouldn't expect her not to prioritize them which I respect but that wasn't the point.

Honestly if you don't know why you suck, you shouldn't be getting married to anybody in the first place. What did you think was gonna happen when you decided to date/marry someone with kids?

OP\u2019s PARTNER is giving him shit for being irresponsible herself with notifying him, and with his reasonable response of trying to cancel and reschedule and salvage something, and that makes her the asshole - she should be understanding that her lack of alternative babysitting plans destroyed an adult getaway, and be happy that OP is understanding of why it needed to be cancelled/rescheduled.", "She could have told him when she knew the kids was going to be with her. Instead of waiting until the very last minute to pressure him into taking the kids as well. Unexpected stuff happens all the time, being able to communicate it is what she failed to do. She could have easily sent him a text or called him to tell him about the death in the kid's father's side of the family. Which would have avoided the entire situation.\n\n I had a situation close to this come up this weekend, as the person that was going to watch my kids while I had a couples night out went to the hospital. As soon as I found out I texted my girlfriend and we redid our plans.\n\n Communicating the unexpected situations life throws at everyone is something that is required to building a relationship. He could have stayed and talked it out, sure. However, she didn't include him in the choice of the kids coming along as well. Maybe he planned such a couple's night that included places not suitable for young children (like a restaurant called Better-Than-Sex.) We don't know.", "We don't know why she didn't, though. Maybe there was a reason.

I hope people understand OP should not be required to go on a trip with the kids are included. He never mentioned that he hates the kids or doesn't hang out with them. The fact that she randomly tried to include them last minute is ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "She needed to tell him before she showed up so they could figure out if they need to reschedule or change the vacation plans.\n\nShe was TA for just assuming that how she wanted to handle it was the only way and to not even give OP a heads up or discuss the change in plans firat is incredibly rude.", "If it was short enough notice that she couldn\u2019t find a sitter maybe she didn\u2019t have time?

She's awful.", "It sounds like they both wanted alone time together. What do you think she did? Conspired the death of her ex\u2019s family member so she could have her kids??? Life happens and maybe she didn\u2019t have time to talk to him about it and assumed since they are getting married and her kids are his kids that it would be okay.", "Yes she should have communicated but it also could have happened very suddenly and she might not have had time? Also if I\u2019m marrying someone with kids then they will never be \u201csprung\u201d on me. He\u2019s a parent now and unexpected shit happens and you gotta roll with it.

They probably booked a room with only one bed!", "Yes, but it takes far longer to pack for 2 kids than 15 minutes. There was time to text/call. ESH", "It's in the OP.  OP suggested to reschedule, she begged to include them.  OP left.  \n\nWhat else could OP do?  The option was be manipulated into a literal last minute change, or argue about it in front of the kids. \n\nWhere are you getting that she was willing to compromise?  I see that no where. It was hey, me and the kids are ready to go on our trip. Who the fuck does that?", "That doesn\u2019t change anything.  My point still stands that she should communicate instead of manipulate.

From his post he had no problem with cancelling the trip. There is nothing that you can say that indicates that she didn\u2019t have time to send a text letting him know that plans changed.

To not call you and ambush you is super manipulative. She had really no right to do that. She should have called you right away and let you know she could no longer make the trip.

Whoever died are the kids\u2019 family too.

If she had invited her best friend and her husband to join them, and ambushed OP like that, everyone would be voting NTA.

And at the last minute too; if it\u2019s even possible, you\u2019re paying the highest prices.\n\nHer final mistake was even trying to say that *you ruined the trip* because you setup a trip for two adults at her request, and then proceeded to cancel the trip when you got ambushed with having to deal with making literal last minute arrangements her children.

I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re wrong for driving off; it\u2019s not appropriate to get into an argument in front of a 4 year old and a 7 year old, it\u2019s appropriate to separate and cool off and NEVER argue in front of innocent children.\n\nNTA at all, and she owes you the apology, not the other way around.

Activities that now have to be child friendly after you get to the resort. Getting the kids a room, bed. Etc. And wtf, that is so annoying to have to deal with. You didn\u2019t plan for that because this was supposed to be for a whole different occasion\u2026\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that she failed to communicate immediately as soon as she knew that her kids would be in her possession rather than spring it on you the day of.

I'm back and forth here.\n\nI'm going with NTA because of one detail.  You decided to cancel the trip and she begged you not to.  If she had nobody to watch the kids, the most obvious solution is cancelling, and she should understand that.  It would suck to cancel plans but life happens when you have kids, and you would be the AH for being engaged to a parent but not being willing to adjust to kid-related circumstances.\n\nBut waiting to tell you until you were already there AND trying to make you not cancel pushes it over the edge into manipulation.  Especially because, if she wanted you to try to rearrange plans with wherever you were going, it's even MORE important to call you ahead of time.  It's entirely possible that you wouldn't even be able to rearrange the plans to accommodate the kids (18+ hotel, no other rooms available, room not big enough to fit in two additional cots, etc), in which case she would've told the kids they were going on a fun trip and packed them up only to let them down (and probably blame it on you rather than herself).\n\nIt's unreasonable to expect dating parents to not prioritize their kids, but if they're being dishonest about how that prioritization plays out then they're not keeping up their side of the bargain.

He did the adult thing by removing himself from the situation.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she was going along with having an adult conversation right then.", ">Yeah, he could have done a similar thing once he got there. \n\nHe went there to pick her up go on the actual trip when she sprung her kids on him. The time to have that talk had passed by then.", "But it wasn't a funeral. OP said \"death in the family.\" Funerals are usually planned. i'm assuming the ex is going to be around family and I'm sure the 4 and 7 year old would be welcome to hangout with family members.", "As a front desk worker, mom probably thought if they showed up with the kids that the hotel would just switch their reservation to a room with 2 queen beds.\n\nHappens every sold out night", "He found out when he arrived. \"I was confused til she told me about the situation her ex had.\" She didn't tell him beforehand. She failed to communicate about the change of plans before he got there.", "It sounds like she was making a unilateral decision to bring the kids, not share that detail with him, and wait to ambush him with it. Considering she was begging him to go on the trip anyways leaves little room for calling OP TA. \n\nFor all we know she could of been cussing him out and calling him a shitty person for refusing to take the kids on a couple's trip, in that case it would be better for him to leave to diffuse the situation. \n\nMaybe ESH but we don't have the details to determine that, only that she was TA for ambushing him and expecting him to take the kids.", "Admittedly the language is vague, but nothing here makes it seem like it\u2019s his choice to not be very involved in the kids lives. Maybe it is, maybe it\u2019s his fianc\u00e9\u2019s choice, maybe it\u2019s something they both agreed upon. It sounds like the kids father is still very much in their lives. If this is the case she may not really be looking for another parent for her kids, maybe she just wants a partner and is happier with OP not really taking on a fatherly role. Also he does call them his step-kids at one point and he\u2019s not even technically their step-parent yet so maybe he is closer to the children than he makes it seem. We can\u2019t know everything about this guy\u2019s life or relationships from one Reddit post lol\n\nEdit to add: it seems like the two of them don\u2019t actually live together. In this case \u201cshe\u2019s been busy with work and the kids\u201d might just mean that she lives alone with two young kids and doesn\u2019t have much time for date nights because she\u2019s gotta pick them up from school, take one to soccer, help the other with homework, make them dinner, etc. It doesn\u2019t necessarily means he has no relationship with these kids", "The hour of the trip.", "As someone without kids that goes out occasionally, I appreciate you. I would never complain about a kid or parents in a restaurant because I know how kids are and you\u2019re just trying to eat and do your best but to know there are some parents out there that would actually ask to not be seated near people on a date is so considerate and kind. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA but ESH because of how they handled the situation.", "I think they meant the Y T As were coming from people who believe the whole world should adjust to accommodate their kids, I don\u2019t think most parents are this way", "No one said all of you do it.", "Pretty sure that commenter was specifically talking about the YTA people commenting.", "Or they were packed up for the change of custody.", "This was my exact thought...How come the dad couldn't take the kids? OP said he was going towns away. So did the ex drive?", "Doesn't matter if it was hours or days - either way was long enough to call OP.  I think she was just looking to avoid a disagreement and force the issue.", "Side note\u2026.absolutely love your username", "I think another question that needs answered is how often is this type of event occuring, because while I will never say parents should not put their children first, the children should not be the only priority receiving attention. The first sentence of this post makes it seem like their relationship hasn't received much attention lately and this trip was supposed to be a form of recovery on that missed time.\n\nIf OP is constantly being pushed aside for every small thing and their relationship is not receiving the attention needed to survive, that makes this response being the culmination of all these small factors much more reasonable.", "You would be surprised how many parents there are like this but you would never notice them.  You would only see the parents who aren\u2019t like this.  It\u2019s why people with kids mostly socialize with others with kids.  Because we get it.", "Eh, seemed like an overall generation, but if I misinterpreted it\u2026than I guess I misinterpreted it.", "The ex saw an opportunity to mess up her sexy little getaway.", "That\u2019s the problem with stories like this - some of us make snap all or nothing judgements and assumptions while others hold off for more background info. \n\nAs someone who has lost friends, distant and close family - it can be hard to prioritize responsibilities, specially in the first few hours. \n\nChances are you are correct in that the fianc\u00e9 wanted/assumed bringing the kids was ok. I just hesitate to apply malicious intent until there is more info.", "You\u2019re not wrong. That first sentence hit me kinda weird. Like, what\u2019s been going on with the kids that she\u2019s been \u201cbusy\u201d with them besides the day to day busy of raising them. \n\nI wonder how old OP and his fianc\u00e9 are and how long they\u2019ve been together. It might help inform the dynamic. \n\nI can totally see how this might be a straw that broke the camels back situation.", "Uh no. This is AITA, the only intent that can be assumed is malicious. She was probably bringing them in case they were in a car accident and she needed a kidney.", "I agree with you. For all we know the biodad suddenly hit his forehead and went \"oh snap! I was supposed to get my kids today\" before leaving for the funeral, and had to make arrangements with their Mom at the last minute for her to take the kids. But I'm still going with ESH. Yes, their Mom should have at least sent OP a text heads up \"hey my kids are here their dad has to leave them with me to go to a family funeral a long distance away after somebody dropped dead\" or something similar to that. Assuming she intentionally neglected to mention anything to OP until OP arrived, excited for their trip, fiancee made a bad choice. But OP also made a bad choice -- he didn't understand the assignment, he just took his ball and left instead of cancelling the trip, parking the car nearby, and saying OK what do you need me to do and later we can Netflix and chill, don't worry about the trip, we'll take an even more romantic trip next time. OP just argued and left like a sad teenager who's mad his girlfriend has to babysit.", "Just to add on, if it was a couple\u2019s trip, it\u2019s very possible they weren\u2019t going to a kid friendly place, or he had planned and was paying in a way that would make the trip altogether not kid friendly. Without knowing if it was supposed to be kid friendly but kid free & how long she had known and had the kids prior to him showing up, it\u2019s difficult to come to a definitive answer. She completely blindsided him and expected him to be fine with it, and OP could\u2019ve talked with her like an adult instead of just driving off. But I think he was within his right to cancel the trip, whether or not it was feasible for them to take the kids is irrelevant if it was supposed to be his money funding the entire thing. Fianc\u00e9 should have told him she had the kids so he could rearrange and plan accordingly.", "Especially if there's a split custody arrangement (which I'm assuming because she felt comfortable leaving the kids with him for the length of the trip, if he were unfit for more than visitation that would be unlikely)\n\nAs a complete aside, life before death. \ud83d\ude09", "Hahahahaha ok that made me giggle", "Exactly my take on it. I went with the same verdict as you.", "Journey before destination \ud83e\udd70", "Or maybe I went with the same verdict as you :D"]}
