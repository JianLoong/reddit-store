She did the grocery shopping and the cooking for the house.  I gave her money and she took care of it.  \n\nI tried this with the middle kid the first week after his sister moved out.  Him and his brother spent all the money on delivery in two days.  \n\nI didn't give them more money so they had to spend their own.  They were pissed.  \n\nSo now I buy the basics.  Pasta, bread, eggs, cheese.  That sort of thing.  And I only cook for myself.  My ex wife, my daughter, and myself have all tried to teach them to cook.  They refuse.  \n\nSo they have been having to cut back on their expenses because I won't buy ready to eat meals, delivery, or food prep.  \n\nMy ex moved to Wisconsin and my kids know better than to say they want to go live with her.  They like Texas winters just fine after experiencing just one up north.  \n\nThey talked to me the other day about food again.  They said I'm being cheap by not providing them with better food options.  It was Saturday so I went in the fridge and pulled out some chicken thighs I had defrosting.  In an hour I had butter chicken and broccoli with naan bread for our lunch.  \n\nI told them that I wasn't going to make any changes to how things ran in my house.  I told them all they had to do was go to college and I would cover their meal plan. Nope. They like their lives other than the food situation.  \n\nMy mom called me today and said I was being mean to her poor babies.  I offered to send them to live with her.  She politely declined and dropped it.  \n\nI do this with everyone who contacts me on their behalf. And then I tell them how it went.
