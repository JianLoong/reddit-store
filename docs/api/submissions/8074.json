She did the grocery shopping and the cooking for the house.  I gave her money and she took care of it.  \n\nI tried this with the middle kid the first week after his sister moved out.  Him and his brother spent all the money on delivery in two days.  \n\nI didn't give them more money so they had to spend their own.  They were pissed.  \n\nSo now I buy the basics.  Pasta, bread, eggs, cheese.  That sort of thing.  And I only cook for myself.  My ex wife, my daughter, and myself have all tried to teach them to cook.  They refuse.  \n\nSo they have been having to cut back on their expenses because I won't buy ready to eat meals, delivery, or food prep.  \n\nMy ex moved to Wisconsin and my kids know better than to say they want to go live with her.  They like Texas winters just fine after experiencing just one up north.  \n\nThey talked to me the other day about food again.  They said I'm being cheap by not providing them with better food options.  It was Saturday so I went in the fridge and pulled out some chicken thighs I had defrosting.  In an hour I had butter chicken and broccoli with naan bread for our lunch.  \n\nI told them that I wasn't going to make any changes to how things ran in my house.  I told them all they had to do was go to college and I would cover their meal plan. Nope. They like their lives other than the food situation.  \n\nMy mom called me today and said I was being mean to her poor babies.  I offered to send them to live with her.  She politely declined and dropped it.  \n\nI do this with everyone who contacts me on their behalf. And then I tell them how it went.

There's always food here, but it's the stuff you grew up on (frugal) and you'll have to help with cooking and cleanup.\n3. You must do your own laundry and wash your own dishes, and tidy up after yourself in the bathroom, even those who are working literally 60 hours per week. If wet laundry is left in the washer, I reserve the right to put it on your bed. If it happens twice, I might put it on the lawn. If you load the washer, stick around long enough to move that load to the dryer, too.\n4.

No sleepovers or SO's moving in. It's a small ranch house and a big family, and we are a working class family. We can't take on anybody else or share the one bathroom with one more person.\n\nIn our family, this has worked. No slackers, no grifters, no entitled brats in this house. But if a very hardworking young person just needs that safety net and that longer running start, because times really are very hard for non-rich families, then they'll always have a bed here and food on the table.

He moved out for awhile but got burned out by repeated Covid and overwork, so we encouraged him to move back for a few months to a year to rest up and enjoy some home support for a bit, so that he can finish this apprenticeship. He contributes \"rent\" and buys his own food, and has a nice nest egg in the bank, and will re-launch this summer. Son #3 (22) has a mild disability and has thus taken longer to get his feet under him, with his career plan and training. The only thing between him and independence at this point is a small amount of debt, that he is paying off as quickly as possible. When that is gone, he and his girlfriend will be able to afford an apartment together.  He has a good job and a good future. Son #4 (18) has the same disability as Son #3, only far more severe. He is not able to work a regular job, but wants to forestall a legal designation of disability for as long as possible, because he is able to work if he can manage his own hours, working positions, and other factors. So we are trying to set up a home-based business for him. Even with his limitations and challenges, he is willing and able to do his 40 hours per week for work, and live according to the home rules. He might live at home for the long-term, so we are converting the garage to an actual apartment for him.

It led to some very tough times for me. But in the end, it made me grow up, become responsible for myself, get treatment for my problems, and become an adult.

I dunno, sounds a little like your take on the situation doesn\u2019t it? I would ask for a compromise. You\u2019ll cook a few meals of the week for everyone, and they need to cook a couple meals for everyone and in exchange you guys go as a family to buy ingredients.
