He complained that he didn\u2019t feel good and he doesn\u2019t want to. Which bothered me because I\u2019m ALSO sick.

Since we were both sick, we arranged to meet a family member who would take the child to the party and meet us afterwards.

There has been lots of life stress, which I want to validate, but we all experience stress and need to learn how to cope. I try to be there for him, and make things easier on him, but I also don\u2019t want to enable lazy behavior\u2026 so is he going through something he\u2019ll overcome or is this his new personality? Complacency? I\u2019ve invested so much, but I have been questioning if this is the attitude/behavior of a loving husband/father.\n\nWe go to couples therapy.
