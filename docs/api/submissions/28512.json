You\u2019ve been told not to do it, respect their traditions. Love languages don\u2019t exist so that you can force what you want on other people. That\u2019s not love, it\u2019s control.", "YTA. You have asked and been told no, it would be rude. It may be your love language but in my family it is considered extremely bad manners to being your own food to a meal you've been invited to. It is seen as as an implication that the meal I plan to provide will be insufficient in some way. Are you saying I'm a bad cook? Or that I don't serve a big enough portion? Or that I (worst of all) buy cheap produce? \n\nHe said it would be rude. Listen to him. Take flowers for the hostess or a bottle of wine.\n\nDoing something you have been explicitly asked not to do is not how love language works.", "You asked and they said no. \n\nBring a bottle of wine or something. It's not an insult to your love language if you can't cook or bake for once.", "YTA\n\nThey've planned a menu, and what you bring may not fit. Your BF is right, why are you ignoring him?\n\n If you wish to bring something, bring a plant, flowers, etc.", "Sharing food is absolutely how I show my care for other people. It feels good to make something that makes someone happy, even for a moment. \n\nBut absolutely YTA. You offered, they said no. You asked again to clarify if something small was okay, and were told no. At this point, *you* need to adjust. \n\nYou're deliberately going against the wishes of the other person. That isn't showing love, it is showing that YTA.", "YT(minor)A\n\nYou've got a love language. Cool. But the host of the party asked you not to do a thing and you did it anyway.", "If you\u2019re told no, respect that or YTA", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter what your family does - you are a guest and you should respect what the hosts want.", "It is rude to bring a host/hostess something to be served at the dinner they invited you to share - unless they accept your offer.\n\nSo, if etiquette is your concern - respect their wishes. \n\nYWBTA if you ignore they declined and your BF asked you not to do this. They might not have a Thanksgiving meal potluck style, after all. Different families have different traditions.", "YWBTA if you brought something after being told it would be considered rude at that household. Everyone has their own traditions and if you're going to their house, you should respect theirs. (within reason)", "YTA you asked, they declined. Have them over another time for a meal.", "YTA\n\nYou asked and the hosts refused your offer. And by your boyfriend's reaction they were not refusing just to be polite to you. \n\n>Sharing my cooking and baking is a love language of mine\n\nMaybe cooking a whole meal for their family in their own home is your boyfriend's family tradition. How much of a love language is it if it leaves the people you are trying to show love feeling offended in their own home?\n\nIf you want to do your way, just do it at your home, in a event you host so you can set the rules.", "You asked, they said no. Your family has their traditions, his family has their own traditions. Just let it be. You're NTA for wanting to contribute, but YWBTA if you still brought food after them telling you not to.\n\nETA: Just glanced at your post history. I am so sorry for your loss. This Thanksgiving might be pretty tough on you. I hope you enjoy your time at your boyfriend's home. Don't worry about the food.", "Yes, YTA if you insist for bringing food.\n\nAsk your bf if you can bring something different (like wine, or a decoration for the table). If nothing is needed, bring the hosts flowers or a house plant if they like them.", "YTA.  You offered, they said no thank you, now back off gracefully.\n\nBecause your love language is your cooking doesnt mean you can force it on people who have asked you not to, it would make you a very impolite guest. Families have their own ways of doing things, and your boyfriends family ways are different to your family ways, so whilst you are a guest in his parents house, you behave accordingly.\n\nPerhaps afterwards you could send them a thank you for dinner note, along with  some cookies youd baked?  That would be a lovely gesture.", "YTA - Bring flowers, wine, box of high-end chocolates, not   food you prepared - especially if the offer was declined. Otherwise, you may send the message you don't care for their food/cooking without even trying it", "YTA if you go against your in-law\u2019s wishes AND your boyfriend\u2019s advice and bring something. They told you not to bring anything; he told you it was rude. If you bring something, it won\u2019t be an expression of your love language, it will be selfish  and rude. \n\nInstead, invite them over to your place to cook for them, or bring/send them some baked goods on another occasion. But follow your boyfriend\u2019s lead on what is and isn\u2019t rude with his family", "That's not how love languages work. It has nothing to do with YOUR love language. You're supposed to read the other person's language and do something that makes them feel loved. They want to provide the food. Go and enjoy it and say thank you! Bring a hostess gift if you wish.\n\nYta I guess? But it's not like you're actually an AH.", "YWBTA\n\nYour family dinners were for your family. Your boyfriend hopefully has a different family. It was nice of you to offer but they said no- drop it.", "It may not be appropriate for this family, but I always bring a new set of storage containers to my sister's Thanksgiving meal. She and my nieces cover all the food making and I usually bring a pie, but it's a chance for my sister to unload some of her older food storage pieces by sending left overs home in dishes she won't care about losing. Or, if she prefers to keep her stuff, she can send food out in what I bring.", "If they say they don't want you to bring food, then it would probably be perceived as rude.\n\nHowever, a glass of wine, or a cheesecloth wrap full of mulling spices and a jug of apple cider, are usually safe.", "NAH\n\nYour family's tradition is everyone brings something. His is that the hoest provides the food.  You offered to bring something, they declined, so I'd leave it at that.\n\nAs you get to know them better over time, you can ask in advance, \"Hey, I'd really like to bring something - do you mind?\"  But for now, leave it.", "NAH. You like to bring things but they don't need you to at this gathering. So don't bring anything and simply enjoy the meal.", "Listen to him, okay.  It might be considered rude in his family at this point.  Just wait to do this", "Not the ahole for wanting to share, YTA if you do anyway after being told not to.\n\nIf you feel the need to bring something, then bring a bottle of wine or a pretty bouquet of flowers.", "YTA. Don\u2019t be that guest. Bring some flowers or wine.", "YTA\n\nThis is asked and answered *by his family* and now you\u2019re on Reddit asking strangers to give you permission to do the one thing you were asked not to do. Wow. \n\nIf you feel a burning need to bring something, bring a bottle of wine or some flowers. \n\nNext year, host Thanksgiving and make it pot luck.", "Bring wine.", "NAH. Bring a bottle of something instead.", "Now, a box of homemade candy for the hosts might go down well. It is something they can have on another day OR bring out after the meal if they so choose.\n\nIt also matches you love language.\n\nAsk your boyfriend whether he thinks that would be a good idea.", "NAH, unless you do decide to bring the food. As a guest it would be rude not to do as your hosts request. Your boyfriend has told you how this would be viewed, believe him. It seems odd to you but to them it is legitimate.\n\nPlease don't use this love language thing to breach other's boundaries.", "NTA, because you want to do something nice, but respect his family's traditions.", "NTA but pushing the issue will cross that line. You\u2019re a guest. Be respectful of their wishes.", "NTA but maybe consider bringing wine instead?", "NTA - It is your love language to share food that you have prepared for the ones you love. Your boyfriend's attitude towards this is concerning, as it means that he does not respect your needs. He must not understand how important it is to you to bring something for Thanksgiving dinner. He should be supporting your desire to bring food, rather than discouraging it. If you still want to bring something for Thanksgiving dinner, I recommend that you do so. Sharing your cooking and baking may seem small to him, but it is important to you. Stand your ground and make the guacamole!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
