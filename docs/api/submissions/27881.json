They act a headband with flat speakers built in. Bluetooth connection so no cords in bed.\n\nMy wife likes to watch Tv in bed. I don't sleep well with the light and sound. So as a compromise she wears sleep headphones and watches her phone/tablet in bed.\n\nNTA btw. kids don't need to hear crime stories about murder.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s a little odd she won\u2019t wear headphones. I also wouldn\u2019t want a child listening to that. \nAlso sleeping with ear plugs in every night sounds terrible. You\u2019d think she\u2019d just move her nightly routine to a different room so you wouldn\u2019t have to wear them.", "NTA. \n\nIn general, why isn't SHE wearing headphones to listen to her stuff at night in a quiet room? It's great that you can sleep through it, but it is really inconsiderate to assume everyone around her can sleep through any noise, let alone a murder podcast. \n\nAnd she doesn't know if her toddler will fall asleep AT ALL while having to be in the room with noise. Even if she was just listening to music I'd say no, that keeps people awake, and she can put in headphones. But a 3 year old would be listening to something potentially scary, can understand parts of what is being said, and deserves a peaceful, quiet place to sleep just like an adult.", "NTA - toddlers hear and understand much more than we give them credit for...and depending on how loud, could also be disturbing neighboring rooms.\n\nWhat does she do on the plane? Does also insist on broadcasting her music/podcast aloud for everyone to hear? Does she take calls on speakerphone in public? That kind of disregard for those around you is absolutely selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nOP isn't controlling what wife can or can't listen to, OP is controlling what she & her child are being forced to listen...and that's a perfectly acceptably criticism. If wife refuses to wear headphones of any kind when sharing a space with other people (including OP), missing her podcast is on her, not OP.", "NTA, and i have a very personal explanation as to why. my mom is also a huge true crime fan, and my parents would watch 48 hours (and the likes) almost every night. i would watch with them before bed, since there wasn\u2019t much else for a little kid to do at that hour. i wound up becoming immensely paranoid because of these documentaries to the point i wouldn\u2019t sleep for hours. i became convinced that these situations could happen to my family, that someone could break in and kill us at any moment. i would hide in my closet at night and (embarrassingly) didn\u2019t sleep in my own bed until i was 12. no kid should be exposed to true crime, it made me extremely anxious and i developed insomnia/nightmares starting when i was about your daughter\u2019s age.", "NTA, she can have her podcast she just needs to wear headphones because your daughter is in the room.\n\nEven if nothing scary comes on, this is not a great way to help your daughter get to sleep on vacation.", "NTA and your wife is incredibly selfish. The daughter can and will hear at least once. She won't understand, but she will understand that it's scary. She needs to either not listen, or grow up and wear headphones or earbuds this one week.", "Has she not heard of headphones?", "NTA - my little one remembers a robotic alligator that my parents had in their pool when she was 1.5 years old and she still brings it up at 5 years old and is scared of their pool because of it.

Mom was being selfish.   She could either do without, listen to a different podcast that's not about topics not suitable for a 3 year old, or wear headphones.   \n\nAnd this is coming from some who uses dateline to fall asleep.

Honestly surprised why your wife doesn\u2019t just wear headphones for this? They\u2019ve invented ones that are comfortable to wear while sleeping. Problem solved. Just weird she\u2019d prioritize hearing a podcast over being considerate to her own child", "NTA. I will listen to true crime with my 8mo in the car but not my 3yo. The receptive language of a 3yo far outpaces their expressive language so who knows what they are picking up or imprinting. \n\n There are 3891648750 podcasts out there- surely she can find something PG to listen to with a toddler in the room.", "NTA. It is absurd to have a 3 year old listen to that.", "All this drama could be easily diffused by purchasing a headset", "Nah NTA. Headphones are a thing and your request was indisputably reasonable.", "NTA. You weren't trying to control what she listens to, but were trying to control what your kid gets exposed to.

Regardless if she's sleeping or not it can still get to her subconscious....NTA", "NTA. I listen to murder podcasts too and won\u2019t listen to them around my baby.

Your wife needs to put in an effort to find headphones that are comfortable for her.", "NTA. She needs to get over the headphones thing. It\u2019s rude to force anyone to listen to your stuff and she\u2019s lucky you\u2019ve been kind about it thus far. The toddler part of this is just extra egregious- you\u2019re 100% right about that too. The fact that she can\u2019t overcome some initial discomfort from headphones to be considerate to her family\u2026 not great.", "NTA. She sounds like a brat. She can put headphones on and grin and bear it or not listen. Children don\u2019t need to hear true crime podcasts at all. It\u2019s not controlling ffs. Have common sense people.", "I put my phone directly under my pillow on the lowest volume for my murder fix. It's more about the sleep disturbance from the kid's pov at that age, but some stuff will be picked up. She's reckless if she plays one that she hasn't vetted. NTA.

I do not think a toddler should listen to murder podcasts", "NTA I wouldn't want a toddler hearing that either", "NTA from me. Wild that's she's so inconsiderate that she can't use headphones and can't power through the inconvenience to her  and as such she has to inconvenience others", "NTA\n\nOver the ear headphones are uncomfortable? Get a grip. This has serious princess and the pea vibes.", "all the people calling you ta for saying \"my wife cant\" are comical. you're not limiting her personal freedom and controlling her, you're telling her \"our 3 year old shouldn't hear about someone getting hacked to bits or assaulted before/during bed.\"", "Seriously, NTA. Sure, it\u2019s a baby right now, so they don\u2019t understand \u2026 but how\u2019s she going to manage when they\u2019re a little older if she can\u2019t manage a few nights without her \u201croutine\u201d and is unwilling to get headphones in for the hour it\u2019s playing ?\n\nEdit: 3 year old ? That\u2019s not a baby. My kiddo was 3 only two years ago and he could understand *everything* he shouldn\u2019t. True crime podcasts at that age ? Gtfo", "NTA. Your wife is selfish.", "NTA.\n\nAnd the fact that she went straight to accusing you of trying to control her, when you both know full well that you're thinking of what's best for your kid, is a huge red flag.", "Why tf doesn\u2019t she use earphones? NTA even if it was just you that\u2019s really rude to turn a podcast on loud while someone is trying to sleep", "I\u2019ve got an awesome sleep mask/headphone that works great.  It\u2019s like a soft headband that has flat speakers sewn in underneath the fabric.  It\u2019s cordless and has Bluetooth.  Maybe look into that for the future. NTA.  Babies can take in the bad when sleeping.  That\u2019s why we always play sweet, soft music and not thrasher metal for babies at bedtime.", "NTA though I\u2019d recommend some sleep headphones. They\u2019re like a sleep mask with a built in sound system that only the wearer can hear. They\u2019re much more comfortable than earbuds or regular headphones. They can also be Bluetooth accessible too", "NTA\n\nHeadphones or earbuds......Easy compromise.", "INFO: do you remember the exact words you used? It really does kind of matter if you said \u201cyou are not allowed to do that\u201d versus more politely suggesting why she might not want to.

Answer: air pods.", "May I suggest sleep phones.  They have headband style ones and ones that fit like an eye mask.  Both are made with built in speakers and made to lay flat when your head is on the pillow.", "NTA. I don\u2019t put my kids to sleep listening to horrific crimes being described either. \n\nGrow up and get some earphones, it\u2019s selfish to be like that anyway. Everyone\u2019s gotta do it because she wants it.

A no go", "NTA\n\nIf your kid was still like a newborn or something then I don't think it'd be a problem at all as she would not understand a single word of anything. But at 3 years old, it's definitely too much and is something she would be able to understand what was being said and may even be traumatized a bit from it in a way.\n\nSide note - I also find it weird as fuck that people put on true crime podcasts to fall asleep to. That would not work for me at all, but if it works it works.", " NTA. It\u2019s not appropriate content for a child that young. She can get a Bluetooth sleep mask and still listen to it that way without disturbing your daughter.", "NTA \n\nSince it\u2019s loud for you as an adult, it will be too loud for your child. Wife can use headphones for this.", "NTA. Sharing a room with a toddler means making inconvenient accommodations for the toddler. \n\nIt might be helpful to look into some kind of sleep sound solution for your wife, though. The Kokoon NightBuds have been fantastic for me (a side sleeper), but the Manta sleep mask with integrated headphones could also be a good option, especially for traveling when you don\u2019t have as much control over your environment.", "NTA. She's gaslighting you into thinking that you are wrongfully trying to control what she listens to, which is not the case here.

I used to have one.", "Tell her to either suck it up and wear headphones or not listen to it.", "NTA I watch stuff on my iPad at night in bed wearing headphones to not disturb my husband.

They may not understand it, but they will absolutely walk around later repeating \"FOUND THE KNIFE IN THE TOILET TANK\" or something equally bizarre and uncomfortable.", "NTA - the compromise would be your wife wearing head phones. No they are not comfortable but she can suck it up for a few days, like it\u2019s not a big ask\u2026", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t thinking this through at all. She was only thinking of her routine and not even considering that a child shouldn\u2019t hear stuff like that, even though one would think that\u2019s pretty obvious. I\u2019m not even sure I would want to hear someone listening to that every night without headphones. She doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s very considerate but maybe it\u2019s just this one issue. If you were respectful when you pointed this out to her then you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA, and look into getting a CozyBand for your wife. It's a headband with flat earphones that are designed to be comfortable in bed. https://www.cozyband.com/", "NTA it\u2019s her choice to listen to that how about she uses an EarPod sho she can hear it alone. Because as you said you even wear earplugs to sleep", "NTA, and is she this self-absorbed about other things?\n\nThat\u2019s completely inappropriate to play around a child. Full stop.

My grandma watched true crime shows all the time when I stayed at her house and I remember very young hearing all these graphic stories of murder, kidnapping, and assault of women and children as I could hear her tv from the living room in the guest room nearby. For years I was terrified of being a victim of these crimes and it gave me nightmares. I don\u2019t think children should be exposed to these cruelties so young. \n\nI mean, today I\u2019m 30 and listen to true crime and other horror genre stuff myself but I always wear headphones and try to be mindful of people around me because I remember being that 6 year old terrified every night I\u2019d be killed so I made pillow forts around me hoping it would \u2018catch\u2019 bullets or knives aimed at me.", ">chances are she\u2019ll fall asleep before the podcast gets graphic\n\nYeah, or she'll stay awake with curiosity for this unfamiliar form of media and get traumatized. She can just pick a child appropriate podcast for a couple days. \n\nThe people saying you're being controlling have a wild perspective IMO. Of course you should be able to firmly object to horror media being played around a young child at night. That's basic parenting, not undo control. NTA", "NTA. there are soooo many options out there for podcasts, tell her to find one like huberman lab or no dogs in space", "NTA.  It's inconsiderate to listen to anything without headphones unless the other people present are actively engaged also.", "What kind of selfish partner do you have there, OP?\n\nThis is pretty standard stuff for parents when traveling with kids. When you're a parent, you sacrifice for them, pretty much all the dang time. \n\nI'm a night person, but when I'm staying in a room with my wife and kids, I go to bed early. To be clear, this is really, really hard for me to do, way outside my normal routine. I am just not tired at the time they're all in bed, but it's part of the gig, you have a young child, that's just the kind of sacrifices you make.\n\nShe will survive a few nights without her True Crime podcast.\n\nNTA.", "Nta, I had to learn the hard way that the kiddo is listening.

When I was that age, all the adults in my life loved true crime. They always thought I wasn\u2019t paying attention. What actually happened was it taught me that the world is a horrible place with murderers around every corner. That I\u2019d be lucky to make it to adulthood without getting murdered. It taught me that it\u2019s normal to be murdered, to know murderers, to find bodies, etc. It really fucked me up. I didn\u2019t start unlearning that world view until I was an adult. It gave me such severe anxiety that without medication, I have 3 panic attacks minimum every single day\n\nIt can really mess up a kid if you let them listen to that stuff, even if they don\u2019t hear the gruesome part. Even if she definitely fell asleep, some people can still hear in their sleep or she could wake up suddenly.

She should use them. \n\nAdd Note: I\u2019m no doctor and I don\u2019t know all the facts, but there\u2019s definitely something to be said about subliminal messaging as well. People have created tapes and things to listen to specifically while you sleep. (Sometimes to learn new things, or help break addictions, etc. etc.) While we may not be conscious, our body and brain are still picking up those signals. It may affect her (the child\u2019s) dreams at night. Or it may not. Everyone is different.", "Soft YTA. It's the \"saying my wife can't...\" part that got me.

I do find that the charging cable wears out, so I buy a new pair about once a year.\n\nIf the headphones are a complete no go, instead of asking her to forgo any podcast (it's incredibly difficult for me to sleep in silence), just ask her to put on one with family friendly content. I'd recommend Stuff You Should Know. There's tons of episodes, they're usually family friendly, and their voices are suitable for sleeping: no shouting or screeching.
