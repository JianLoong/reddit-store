If she can't respect that, don't go. Its not an invalid concern.  Quite honestly, I wouldn't go if he were even attending.   \n\n\nHowever, all the fake names in the world and you choose Bryony?   WTH?   lol", "NAH.\n\nShe can invite him to her wedding if that's what she wants to do. And you are fully entitled not to go if you don't want to be near him, or refuse to go if you're seated there. It's understandable.\n\nI had a similar situation with my half-sister. She invited person X and Y. I do not attend any events with those two people for good reason (abuse backstory with them). I didn't go. She's entitled to invite them, I'm entitled not to go.\n\nWhat you both shouldn't do is expect. She should not be expecting you to attend with this seating arrangement, and you should not expect her to disinvite her dad for you. She has no right to be mad at you if you refuse to attend. You have no right to be mad at her for inviting her dad.", "NTA. The couple getting married get to make the rules and the invited guests get to decide whether they want to come to the event. The fact that she told you this ahead of time is an indication that she suspected it might be an issue.  Think about the last couple weddings you\u2019ve been to: how much time did you actually spend with the bride anyway?  It\u2019s hanging out with family that\u2019s the most fun and her plan has taken that off the table.", "NTA. I assume she is inviting other people from his family, like grandparents or aunt/cousins? Probably sitting him with such would be more confortable for everyone involved?", "NTA and your half sister is being very clueless and insensitive in trying to force you to put up with her father just so he won't bother others. I think it's reasonable to skip the wedding if she refuses to listen to reason. How does your mom feel about the planned seating?", "First off, I'm having a hard time getting over the name Bryony. I think I'm going to pronounce it \"Brian E\" instead of \"brigh-onie\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. Not associating with active felons isn't a bad move.", "NTA.  Don't spend time around potentially violent AHs, even if they were once your stepdad.", "NTA at all it sounds like a recipe for disaster stick to what you've said and tell her point blank you will not be attending.", "NTA. You (and your mom and her partner) are NOT her meat shields.", "NTA -- and your half sister is nuts.  No one should force divorced parents to sit togeher.", "ugh this is a receipt for disaster if you ask me. NTA", "I\u2019m torn on this one. It\u2019s good that you have boundaries but instead of threatening to not attend your half-sister\u2019s wedding (which will make her feel defensive), you should very plainly remind her that he\u2019s behaved in inappropriate and borderline abusive ways towards yourself, your mum, and her partner, so that you will all need to sit at a different table than Curt in order to feel safe and happy. Your sister probably already knows this on some level but may be fooling herself about how much her dad\u2019s behaviour has affected you. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019s willing to work out an alternative seating arrangement for you, and if she\u2019s generally a reasonable person, it seems possible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just don\u2019t *go*, you don\u2019t make a big deal out of it, just slip away.

She knows he only knows you guys really and wants him to be comfortable or for you guys to watch him. I feel for your mom and her partner who may leave early because he can easily start drinking or just be unpleasant. It's your choice you can attend and ignore not even a  glance in direction or leave early or not attend.", "NAH, you have every right to not want that and not attend the wedding. However I do understand that this is a very tricky situation for your sister. The problem with parents is that we usually still love them even if they are shitty parents. It is understandable that she wants him at her wedding however she is aware of the fact that he is a risk. I think she is just desperately looking for a solution of how he can still attend. She probably considered you the best shot since you know him best. That doesn't mean that you have to accept her decision but maybe instead of not attending try to sit down with her and ask for her true reasons and come up with a solution", "NTA. Would you feel comfortable attending the wedding but not the reception?", "That sounds like perfect fake name for someone who is weird enough to try to force you to play happy families with Curt", "I'll be honest, it's a small family, I am not sure too many people Curt will know will be going to the wedding"]}
