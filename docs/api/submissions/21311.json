Also, it might be best if you both use a parental communication app like Our Family Wizard (there are others) where you can update a family calendar and it saves all communication so a court can read it later, just to cover everyone\u2019s butts. Even if you don\u2019t use the app, do not speak to your ex aside from text messages or email so you have a record. \n\nStop trying to switch custody days. That\u2019s something only effective co-parents can do. You two aren\u2019t at that point. If it\u2019s your day, your child needs to stay with you, sit by you, etc. You can invite your stepson to the 4th of July and he can come if he wants as he\u2019s an adult and can make his own choices (he can split time, too, like most of us adult children of divorced parents do). Your youngest son still needs to be at his mom\u2019s as it\u2019s her custody time. Sure, he\u2019ll miss the opportunity to hang out with his big brother but that\u2019s fine, he can hang out with him at mom\u2019s or the next time big bro comes to visit at yours. \n\nYour ex is a high conflict parent which means you need to follow the custody agreement to the letter or she will continue to take it out on your sons.

Hopefully youngest will never do the same, blah blah. This is mentally abusive. Get your youngest into therapy ASAP so he can process his mom\u2019s behavior and learn how to process the manipulation. You BOTH need to learn to set strong boundaries with her, a therapist can help him with that, too. \n\nDo NOT let her damage your son. Parental guilt tripping can do so much harm.

Then ask him how he'd feel if you started arguing and calling her names because she was doing things wrong. \n\nTell him you choose to do things in the right way, which is why he doesn't hear you complaining or talking rudely about his mum.

One of the things I realized coming out of my first marriage -- which did explode dramatically, but firstly, we fell out of love -- is that being in love is as much a conscious act and choice as it is a feeling. I think losing sight of that makes it easy for folks to fall out of love during the grind of life.\n\nLike, I can't imagine falling out of love with my husband. But we have several young kids and we don't have a lot of time for each other. I think if we weren't proactively approaching issues from a place of love first, it could be very easy to find ourselves in an unrecognizable marriage in a few years.\n\nSo, like, tl;dr  -- your reasons sound authentic to me, I'm sorry you're in this situation with your ex, and it sounds like your stepson has a good head on his shoulders. Best of luck with the co-parenting moving forward with your ex, it doesn't sound like it's gonna be smooth.", "NTA. As Cher Horowitz's dad once said   \"you divorce wives, not children\"", "NTA\n\nAnd your ex is breaking all kinds of custody rules by trash talking you to your kid. I'd document and ammend custody arrangements.", "NTA.\n\nIt's obvious your stepson wants to keep up the relationship too. Otherwise he wouldn't have invited you to his graduation, and he would have declined your barbecue invitation. \n\nAnd where does your ex get off saying her son's graduation is the most important day of her life? Seriously?! SHE is not the focus of the graduation. HE is. Not only that, if she was so angry about your mere presence at the graduation, she ruined it for herself.\n\nThere is one problem I can see here though, and that is how she's poisoning your son. He's young enough to believe everything his mother says. I don't know what you're going to do about that.", "You're NTA, but don't refer to him as your former stepson.  Always refer to him as your son or stepson.  You didn't divorce him", "NTA - you are exactly right, you were his de facto dad for some big parts of his life, so you can still be involved. You are being a great step-dad.\n\n\nYou are not being unfair to his mom, she is alienating you. Start documenting this.", "NTA. I'll give you a little insight into my life. I met my husband when his child from his previously relationship was 3 years old. I didn't have any children at the time, but it was important to me to have a cohesive relationship with his mother. Today we share a relationship with their son. I have 2 daughters with his father, and his son considers them his sisters. There is no animosity between his ex and I, she even has another son from her current marriage, which he has been included in amongst those my children consider family.\n\nIt is her problem, not yours. Family is who you make it to be...it is not determined by blood. She sounds like an immature, jealous harpy.", "NTA\n\nYour ex is clearly still hurting but you should absolutely not let your former stepson suffer because of it. If she isn't insane she will come around eventually. Just out of curiosity, how involved is his bio-dad?", "NTA! Any step parent who stays a step parent after the relationship is never the NTA! My husband is super close w his former step dad, aka step dad to him or grandpa to our kids. He\u2019s nearly an adult and can make his own relationship decisions. You didn\u2019t ruin anything. You\u2019re a rock star!!", "Nta, glad your step son has you.", "\\> bought him his first box of banana wrappers,\n\nTook me a while to figure out what this meant :D\n\nNTA. Anyway, the son is an adult now and is able to make his own choices.", ">  But even my youngest thinks I'm being unfair to his mom. He said I need to stop being mean to her. \n\nThat is because his mother is, contrary to *all advice*, deliberately trying to drag him into her own personal conflicts with you.\n\nAnd one day he'll see that, especially if you take the high road. If your son says that you should stop being mean, just state, calmly, that this is a private matter and you don't want to put him in the middle. (Do *not* say or imply that his mother is putting him in the middle. He'll figure it out on his own.)\n\nAs for the question you asked - NTA. Your ex sounds delightful.", "wow she seems like a real piece of work, NTA", "NTA- and your stepson knows it, that\u2019s why he\u2019s fighting with his mom, he\u2019s old enough to know who\u2019s actually \u201cmean\u201d but your youngest doesn\u2019t. You would be TA if you don\u2019t take your ex to court for parental alienation.", "NTA. Personally, I think you owe more loyalty to the step son who cares about you than to the ex who despises you. You will always  be this boy's real dad.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to strip her son of a relationship that clearly means a lot to him because you and she had a falling out.\n\nI\u2019m not impressed she\u2019s sharing all of this with young children, and I\u2019m not impressed she\u2019s trying to claim her son\u2019s milestones as HER most important day, so she thinks HER feelings about you matter more than her son\u2019s. \n\nShe\u2019s going to drive her older son away if she keeps this up. She\u2019s not being fair to him. And as a parent, shouldn\u2019t that be important?", "NTA. You\u2019re an amazing dad. \n\nBut honestly you need to ensure she stops tagging you off to your shared child. That shit is beyond despicable but I doubt it\u2019s the worst of her qualities unfortunately", "NTA - your youngest is only repeating what his mum has said.         \nExplain to him that she\u2019s just a bit upset because you want his brother to come and she doesn\u2019t want him to.            \nTell him you said it\u2019s up to his brother what he wants to do and you\u2019re not trying to hurt mum.", ">even my youngest thinks I'm being unfair to his mom. He said I need to stop being mean to her\n\nThis sounds like parental alienation. You admitted that she told your child that you're a bastard. Imagine what else she's telling him about you.\n\nYour ex wife is being unfair. When she agreed to let you into her son's life, she allowed her son to form a bond with you. She doesn't get to just erase that bond because it's no longer convenient for her. She's putting her wants before her son's well-being. She ruined her own holiday, not you.\n\nNTA", "When you\u2019re focus is on the children\u2019s best interest, usually you\u2019re NTA so just keep doing that. \n\nI get that divorce can hurt both parties and the ex-partner never wants to see or deal with you again but it\u2019s not about her. It\u2019s about the children, and they are certainly going to grow up together and most likely want to be around each other too.", "Absolutely agree. NTA. Happy 4th everyone!", "INFO: Was the fighting about, infidelity, abuse, drugs or alcohol?", "Exactly what I was thinking of.", "LMFAO  Good one!"]}
