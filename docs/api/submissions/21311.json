He was seventeen when everything became official with the divorce, and I told him to keep in touch with me, and that I would always be there for him.\n\nLast month was his high school graduation, and he invited me and all my kids. My ex was pissed that I was there, but we didn't sit near her. It was my custody week with our shared child, and I told him he could sit with his mom if he wanted to, and he did. Afterwards, my youngest said his mom told him I was a bastard, which was real nice, I think. She ended up telling me over text how I ruined one of the most important days in her life for her.\n\nWell, the fourth of July is her custody week, and I asked if our kid could come over to my barbeque for a few hours. I also invited my former stepson. She said no immediately, even though I always make concessions for her (like having him go sit with his mom at his brother's graduation, which I never had to do). My stepson agreed to come. I guess they have been fighting in the buildup to today, because she texted me a couple of hours ago saying our son was coming and her son was bringing him over and then back home. She also said I ruined this holiday for her like I ruined her oldest's graduation. She said I am a petty, hateful, resentful person that won't let her have any peace, and she hopes one day everyone sees my true colors.\n\nAm I really the asshole? I just want to retain a relationship with a kid I care about. It's not easy to be someone's defacto dad for some really formative years in their life and then forget about them. I taught this kid to drive and bought him his first box of banana wrappers, how am I supposed to just drop him like a hot potato? But even my youngest thinks I'm being unfair to his mom.

As long as you are minimally respectful when you get a no, you're not being a terrible parent.", "My dude how are you even in doubt, you\u2019re an upstanding person, most step parents don\u2019t even attempt to have a relationship...", "INFO: Can I ask the reason for your divorce?\nBecause it seems strange to me all this hate of your ex towards you for no good reasons, and the fact that she want nothing to with her son's half siblings.\n\n>even my youngest thinks I'm being unfair to his mom. He said I need to stop being mean to her.\n\nParental alienation from your ex or you left something out if your youngest child also feels that you are bullying their mother?\n\nIt's difficult to make a judgment with so little background info.", "NTA. She\u2019s being bitter and petty.", "NTA, your ex is trying to punish you. I'm glad you're trying to be there for the 17 yo!", "NTA!!! - As a former child of a stepfather who I fully claim is my dad, I can say with 100% that you are not. This is of course under the assumption that he is also wanting this, which is apparent by him inviting you to his graduation. His mom ITA. It\u2019s obvious you are an important person in his life, and she is letting her personal grudges and feelings get in the way of that. In fact, it\u2019s to the point that it is overtly effecting events and people around her, like graduation and the Fourth of July. She needs to go to counseling to figure out her own resentment, because it\u2019s not healthy for her or the children. Children can easily be manipulated by those they care about, so much so that a loving father can be turned into an evil monster. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the youngest is the shared child, who is probably getting manipulated, or at the very least used as emotional support, by their mom. This results in them thinking you are being mean to her.", "NTA...It's a shame that your ex is holding onto bitterness instead of thinking about what's healthy for her children.  Your stepson is old enough to make his own decisions.  If he wants a relationship with you, then there's no reason not to.", "NTA. You were a father figure to the teen, says a lot about her to take that away from him.", "NTA. You have a relationship with your stepson and it\u2019s very admirable that you want to continue it when your ex is being spiteful. He is 17 years old and has a mind of his own. It sounds like your ex may be trying to manipulate your youngest though.", "NTA. I\u2019m still friendly and see my former stepmom even though it\u2019s been 10 years. My dad doesn\u2019t like it much but it\u2019s none of his business and he keeps it to himself", "NTA - it was his graduation, he made the choice to have people who were important to him there for this big moment, it was about him, not your ex.\n\nHe wants to maintain a relationship with someone who is/was a major part of his life, he is almost an adult, he can make that decision for himself.\n\nHe sounds a lot more mature than your ex.", "NTA. Your ex is trying to alienate your son from you. Telling him you are a bastard is unfair to you and the child. Talk to your divorce lawyer and ask if it would be possible to sit down with a mediator to work out this issue before it becomes a major problem. There was certainly no problem with you attending your stepson\u2018s graduation, he invited you. Maybe you should agree to not interfere with her custody week by inviting the children to your home. But she needs to understand compromise is a two way street and there may be a time she wants you to help her out and you won\u2019t feel as generous. It sounds very much like you are taking the highroad in the situation, and I hope you will continue to be able to do so. Good luck.", ">She ended up telling me over text how I ruined one of the most important days in her life for her.\n\nWhat you married and, now, divorced is a narcissist.  Her son's graduation day isn't about her, isn't her day to be ruined, and was probably only marred for her son by her having made it about her and gotten so bent out of shape over having people who love him and were invited by him come to HIS big day.\n\n>Afterwards, my youngest said his mom told him I was a bastard,\n\nYour shared son is being manipulated by the narcissist into alienating you and based on the claim that you're being mean to her, when she is the one calling you names and trying to prevent her children from having a relationship with you, she has a good foothold in the process with your youngest child.\n\nNTA but you really need to do something about the parental alienation before it's too late.  Good luck to you.", "NTA.  I always feel sorry for kids who grow close to stepparents (and step grandparents, too) and then are ghosted after the divorce.  Kudos to you for not doing this.  I wish there more like you. Wish your ex could see that this is a good thing.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ruining the relationship between the kids and her, she sounds like a nasty piece of work that\u2019s miserable and wants everyone else to be miserable. Please only communicate via text or email/voicemail so the things she says are on the record in case you ever need them.", "NTA.  You divorced her, not the children.  Very honorable that you have made yourself available to your stepson in a supportive manner.", "NTA\n\nYour ex behaviour is terrible. She's putting her ego above the feelings and wellbeing of her son. Also, it's good for your youngest if you still have a good relationship with his half-sibling. I admire you for trying to keep the contact with your stepson regardless of your ex-wife's horrible behaviour.", "It feels like she forgot that the kids are individual humans in the first place. Her kids indeed buy humans first.\n\nHe didn't graduate for his mother. You didn't hold a bbq to prove some kind of point.\n\nThey are humans of their own, not trophie-machines", "NTA. \nParenting means putting your petty bullshit aside for your kids and swallowing your ego. She is clearly incapable of this.", "NTA. Actually cool of you to want to stay close with him! Props to you man.", "NTA because you\u2019re just making sure all everyone\u2019s included. Though in the future, maybe you and your ex can coordinate holiday celebrations going forward so that the two of you both get the opportunity to celebrate with the children.", "I can see both sides. From her perspective, you asked to have the child on her time. She said no, maybe she already had plans. Now you invite her other child,  who's a adult and can do what he wants. So now the minor child is upset he can't go too. So she  has to allow him or he'll just be miserable. So her family holiday plans are ruined, and you get her kids on her day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you were arguing were the arguments about the kids? How old is your youngest? I ask because you said your youngest is telling you to stop being mean.

She should NEVER badmouth you to your shared child.  She needs therapy.  She sounds like a miserable woman who just wants to hate you for whatever reason.

He said I need to stop being mean to her.\n\nIt would depend on how young he is, but I suspect this is strongly because mom is talking poorly of dad infront of the kid (like calling him a bastard while the step son is graduating).

Even if your are not blood related, you can still have a father/son relationship.\n\nI suggest you try to sit down and talk to your youngest about his mother, to see what she tells him about your during her costudy time. \nThen try to talk to her about the situation to see if you can find a way to coexist and co-parent event if she want to resent you forever.\nAs a last resort, talk to a lawyer about parent alienation and take her to court If you find out that she's poisoning your youngest against you or his siblings.\n\nFor now my judgment is NTA."]}
