They will have them all dumped on them  at once. Why are you setting them up to be behind when there is another option? Sure they may eventually adjust but you are setting them up to do poorly initially AND to have a ton of stress added to them. This is how you make them regret moving and hate living there. Let them do international school first, still get them a tutor to start catching them up and then have the discussion again later. But remember, they know what they can handle better than you do b", "Your reasons are sound, but you would probably be setting them up to fail here. \n\nBecause of their ages, adjusting to a school system where, for example, two additional languages are required and they haven\u2019t actually learned a third language yet seems unreasonable. \n\nAn alternative might be to try international school for a year or two, with extra tutoring to give them the additional skills to do well in the local system.\n\nAs it stands, I think YTA for not considering the pressure you\u2019re putting your kids under, and putting them in an education system they simply won\u2019t be able to keep up with.", "I\u2019ll go with YTA, especially for the 15 year old.  There is no advantage for her to switch to the polish system.  She can be done in 3 years with an American diploma, and go to college.  She can then decide where to live. Switching to a polish system is a huge amount of work with nothing to gain.   The 10 year old still has time to learn the polish system, though, she may prefer to follow her sister.", "As someone who went to school in that part of the world I\u2019ll definitely suggest that you enroll them in an American school. You might have good intentions but you\u2019ll end up regretting it. The system is completely different and a lot tougher than the American system. So for you to dump them thinking they\u2019ll get used to it is simply foolish.\nStart them in an American school and once they feel comfortable in the new environment/ school you can look into transferring to the polish school.", "Speaking as a teacher, your 15 year old should go to the international school.  A disruption in her schooling at this stage will affect her grades, causing a knock on effect on her ability to choose a university.  However, it is a huge upheaval for both of them and they should both be transitioned gently.  Putting them both in the International School is the ideal compromise.  Not only that, but there will be plenty of Polish kids at the school (I went to an American school in Italy, and 80% of the students were Italian!)\n\nYTA", "The kids sound like have they been through a TON and this is another huge change. I would respect their wishes to go to an American School for now. They can always switch after a year or two if you still feel really strongly about it, but it sounds like they are explicitly telling you, \u201cDad, this is more than we can emotionally handle\u201d. As their dad, you show them love by listening to and respecting that. Kids are tough but they need to feel supported, especially through so much upheaval. I would encourage tutors AND offer them the choice of therapy if they want it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, you want your kids to succeed. But it takes healthy emotional balance to and feeling secured and supported to succeed too. Good luck!", "Info: when will the other students have started studying the other two languages? Expecting a 15 year old to catch up to classmates who have been studying the language for 5-10 years is asking a lot. \n\nIf she\u2019s one year behind, or that have different classes for new students that would be different.", "Would you compare the 12 to 15 subjects a year to the 6 or so they are probably taking in the American schools timewise? I mean I can't imagine they are full year courses with 12 or 15 classes a day of 45 or 50 minutes.", "YTA- this is a HUGE change. Yes, you handled it, but you started in the system, and continued. You didn't enter mid-stream, or 100 yards from this finish line.\n\nIt is akin to merging on a freeway at 15 miles an hour. It isn't the thing to do. Please consider allowing them the traditional school system- not because they cannot handle the other one, but because of timing and how late in their education they would be starting.", "Gentle YTA. Your girls are going through a massive upheval. Puberty, lost their mom, moving continents. If they really don't feel comfortable with the idea of a local school and you can comfortably send them to an International school then this could aid in their transition. \n\n\nAnd International schools aren't as much of a bubble  as you make out. They'll likely be around wealthy kids from a wide range of cultural backgrounds, unless this school only accepts children with American families. My friend teaches in an international school and has children from a range of countries, speaking a range of languages. School just happens to be first language English.", "YTA.   I lived overseas for several years in Southeast Asia.  Our son was pretty young so he integrated fairly easy.  From my observations with other expat families, the transition was hardest on teenagers.  It\u2019s a difficult time in life anyway.  Add the death of a parent and an international move and you are looking at a disaster.  Your kids are being very open minded in being willing to move.  Make it as easy as possible for them.  They won\u2019t be in a complete American bubble as they have family there.  It\u2019s not the same as living as an expat where people tend to stick with other expat families.", "Listen to your children. It\u2019s their education. They\u2019re telling you what they want. YOU enjoyed the polish school system but not everyone is you. You probably enjoyed it because that\u2019s all you knew. Just like an American school is what your daughter\u2019s know. You\u2019re taking them away from everything and everyone they know. Why not try to make the school transition a little bit easier. YTA.", "I moved overseas like your kids are doing when I was young. It\u2019s an *enormous* cultural change and you have a whole hell of a lot of adjustment that has to go on here. \n\nRespect your children\u2019s wishes and send them to the school they want - I promise you, from someone who attended both German schools and an international school, they won\u2019t be in that much of a bubble. We had a boatload of German kids too and almost all of us mixed both inside and outside of school. The only ones who didn\u2019t as much were DoD kids, but that\u2019s a different set of circumstances IMO. \n\nLet your kids choose their path, allow them to retain *some* level of normalcy and comfort.", "YTA. Start them off at the American school. They have enough going on as it is.", "YTA\n\nAll I see in this post is about choices you have made for yourself without actually being a parent and thinking what is best for your kids.", "YWBTA if you do this. Moving to a new country is a huge transition. You\u2019re thinking is sound about why, but I would let them go to American school for at least a year. Consider still getting a tutor to aid in bridging \u201cthe gap\u201d. Reassess after a year. \n\nYou want your girls to be confident, feel supported and loved.", "Speaking  from experience \n... the international schools are ridiculously competitive and have much higher expectations for their kids... like expecting them to have multiple AP courses which are college level courses, kids often in these schools are hyper competitive for scholarships to unis... they may have it easier with the local school. There is no real way to see if it is truly easier or not for them until you are there.", "YTA - If you force this on them. Their lives are being uprooted after the death of their mother, and all things considered, they are remarkably mature by being so okay with this move. They are telling you that this one aspect will be overwhelming, so listen to them.\n\nConsider that once they live in Poland, they will meet other kids who attend the Polish schools, and once they hear first-hand accounts, maybe over time they will decide that they are willing to try it out and ask to switch. Or maybe they won\u2019t, that\u2019s okay too. Forcing them into this now could be a real shock to their systems and I don\u2019t see how it\u2019d be beneficial.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you put them in the international school, but ask if they\u2019d like to still have a language tutor? That way they can be up to speed with everyone else communication-wise, but it won\u2019t be on top of all of the extra subjects.", "There's a big difference between learning Polish from you because you speak it, and going to school, being immersed in it, and trying to learn math, physics, history in that language. Not only that, the other language they are learning, they haven't even started learning it yet. And probably being taught in Polish. \n\nThat's why international schools exist. \n\nYTA for forcing it.", "YTA- You said they had options and if they didn't want to move. But some how you\" forgot to mention\" how the school was going to be. They said they didn't want that bur there opinion all of a sudden doesnt matter. Especially at 15 its going to be very stressfull and overwhelming trying to catch up.", "I think YTA but not a bad one. Your girls are too old to adjust to that system. If they were a few years younger, sure not a problem but being in senior high school, it's too much to expect them to catch up and be at the same level as their peers in Poland.", "I haven't read loads of comments, and I don't want to share personal info, but I can relate to what you're doing. I think NAH because its a big scary move and I think their fears and anxieties are valid but I don't think you're wrong for the decision, they'll have a better all round life if they make it work. Why jot do a deal that they try for a period of time, then you reassess. I'd say it took two years for mine to feel settled and offer to find extra curriculars that keep a link with their international roots.", "YTA. Your girls will be going through a LOT of adjustments in a short time. I think the addition of a *much* more rigorous education could be overwhelming. My suggestion (for what it's worth, two cents doesn't buy much these days) would be to put them into the \"international\" school for the first year to give them time to make the adjustments to everything else in their new environment.\n\nAfter that, you can revisit the local school idea. Give them one year to get their feet under them, then they may be feeling more confident to take on the additional academics.\n\nYTA if you push them too hard on this and refuse to take their feelings about school into consideration. Good change is still change, and even if it is welcome, it is still stressful.", "YTA. Not so much an asshole but really, this is a massive transition. Massive. Make it as easy as possible on them.", "YTA. \n\nNo mother.\n\nA move to another country.\n\nNew school.\n\nA shit ton of work.\n\nPoor kids.", "Do you expect your daughters to attend a US university or Polish one? Have you even discussed it? \n\nIf planning to attend a US university it\u2019s better to be in a high school that is aware of the key deadlines and expectations, the international school. If planning to attend Polish university the opposite is true.", "I think between moving and losing their mother that international school would probably suit them better emotionally. Your situation with a Polish school isn't going to be the same as your daughters' as the situations differ entirely. I think at this point their emotional stability is as great of concern as their educational stability. And I don't think YTA because you are reaching out to others and obviously love them dearly.", "NAH, ask them to try the Polish school for 6 months. Reassure them that if they really hate it, they can switch, but they should at least try it first. They may find that doing a variety of subjects is way less boring than the American method.", "Learning multiple languages is the norm over seas\u2026the issue here is that this starts in early childhood. Your kids are 15 and 10\u2026learning languages will more difficult for them ,tutor or not. Not really TA, but you aren\u2019t taking your kid\u2019s concerns very seriously, instead choosing to brush them aside in order to accomplish what you want to do.", "NAH in reality its on language im sure they speak english so they can take that class and then another and try explaining exactly why you liked it better than the american system and then say to try it and of they dont like it you can transfer them or after you talk to them and they still insist say you understand and just thought they would enjoy the same school system you did but that it ok and sign them up to american school", "INFO:  what are the school's hours each day?  How do they fit in that many subjects?", "From an educational perspective, moving at 15, is a critical time, educationally. I personally think that it's unfair to put those requirements on the eldest especially, given that the consequences could be life impacting/changing and result in her under achievement that could have been much higher in the system she has been studying all these years.\n. \n\nWhy disadvantage her?\n. \n\nShe can still attend clubs and activities outside of school. So she'll be making friends etc.\n\n\nIt may also be beneficial for her to have some American grounding given she's gone through such significant changes in such a short time.", "Info. Do you plan to stay in Poland indefinitely and does your girls want to go back to US eventually? I say NTA as this would be a great experience for your daughters but lower expectations of their performance. I think your younger daughter will be fine but the older one will be considering college and high school has other stressors. Leaving their friends and life is difficult enough so be accommodating and be up to changing your initial plans", "NAH. You should consider a compromise. Start in international school, but still get them the tutoring. So if they change their mind and want to transfer they\u2019ll be able to", "I hesitate to call you an AH, but I wouldn\u2019t put my kids in a local school. Let them get their feet wet at the international school. That will probably be enough of a culture shock.", "YTA.  Your older daughter is leaving everything she knows.  All her friends, her dreams about life, her crushes, her school teams and activities, her familiar places.  She has maybe 2-3 more years of school left before she goes to college or gets a job.  Grades matter at this point and you want to start her behind.  So she loses a semester or a year of schooling to get caught up.  She struggles in all her classes because she doesn\u2019t really understand the language.  She is miserable so she tries to get into an american college where none of her classes transfer, none of her potential AP or IB credits would count, and she is behind there as well as paying exorbitant moving and housing costs.\n\nShe will spend all her life grocery shopping, going to movies, visiting the park, hanging with friends, watching tv, eating food, in the Polish bubble.  Don\u2019t demolish her chances and your relationship by messing with her future.  I\u2019ve seen it happen to several teenagers  who moved with one or two years left of school and who dropped out of HS, skipped college, and jump from low wage job to low wage job.", "YTA - you grew up in a polish system, they didn't. It doesn't take much common sense to see why they are so against it now. It's very overwhelming and they have to catch up to their peers in a handful of months essentially.", "NTA...But this is a huge transition to them and they are already going through so much. It is understandable that they are scared/worried. Maybe let them start for a year in an international school and then have the conversation again? Is that an option?", "NAH. I gully understand why they freaked out. But also explain to them that they don't get all subjects on the same day and the it's all spead out. \n\nEven if they go to the American school, they would still be and maybe even remain behind on their peers. They would struggle after high school rather than the first year they're in polish highschool if the international school doesn't pick u the pace as well.\nResearch that to be sure.\n\nBut all in all, if you plan on staying there for a long period of time or indefinitely, it's worth it for them to bite through the sour apple as we say in Dutch. They will integrate better, they catch up soon enough even though it's extra work with tutoring(can you start in the summer with that?), and they will be better challenged to their peers. \n\nMake a list of pro's and cons with them.\nResearch both schools.\nResearch what it would take for them to catch up.\nTalk to them about their opportunities after high school for both schools.\nIt's important that they agree with the final decision, otherwise it's not going work.", "YTA- these are grieving children and three years is not that long and still carry emotional trauma. Add this plus a move to a new country, new culture and these kids are going to have a mental breakdown. Super easy let them do international school for a year or two to help them get caught up and then get them into regular public school. Just be very clear with them two years tops at the international school and then they go to public. \n\nThough honestly be prepared financially for international school for their stay until they are ready for college. Most kids of expats at that age see these types of moves as vacations and are back to America college/permanently return to the US at 18. \n\nYour kids are not polish they are Americans with polish heritage but that\u2019s about it. After being so long in our education system it will be very very hard to adjust culturally and to the education system. I have lived in a expat community and abroad and unless they are babies this does not work well on older children. Prepare and allow for the long term international school.", "I don't think you're an A here, but I do think you should listen to your daughters. The transition should be smooth for them, not something they dread.   \n\n\nThey can always attend the polish type school next year if they realize they can handle it, but even if they don't, it's not that big a deal. It's just school. They'll learn a bunch of useless subjects they'll never use after they graduate.", "NTA. How can it be unreasonable if it's standard for kids over there? If you are going to get them tutors, rip the band-aid off and put them right in. They'll realize they can handle it, which will give them more confidence in the future.", "ESH\n\nThat's a really big change for kids, I don't think it's a great idea to move if their education might get compromised in the process, adding up all those subject and 2 languages makes it impossible to catch up in so little time. They might fall a year behind even with the best tutors. \n\nI think that if the girls don't believe they can do it, then they'll never make it. If you convince them and set up a real plan for their education that is not just an idea, then great move. If you dont convince them and it's actually too hard to catch up, don't move.", "NAH. What you\u2019re doing sounds great and they will just need time to adjust, which would be true no matter what school they attend anyway, but this is just the issue they are focused on. You\u2019re picking the school you believe is best. Maybe try focusing on the wonderful aspects of the school and opportunities they wouldn\u2019t get elsewhere instead of the parts they find less appealing.", "NTA", "NTA but honestly, your daughters are probably to old to make the switch from American school to what is obviously a much better education system than ours. Taking on 2 new languages at their age plus an extra probably 10 subjects is going to overwhelm them, even with tutors, unless they are already academic wunderkind. American school has under prepared them for academic expectations  like this, unfortunately. And TBH, it's probably made them lazy compared to Polish students.", "I would go with the Polish school system. While change is hard, this system will provide a more rounded education for your daughters.  They will be better for it in the end.  Dropping them into an American style school will hamper their integration into their new culture. NAH.  The girls are afraid of the change but will likely be fine.", "NAH. Your daughters are justified but your experience in that school system tells you more about it than any website. The school system seems okay; it might be hard to adjust but if it is in place as a system, it probably works? Worst case after a month they transfer over.", "NTA\n\nThere are tons of expat families that have put their kids into local schools around the world. And most of those kids didn\u2019t already speak the language. \n\nYou\u2019ll support them with tutoring. They\u2019ll be fine. They\u2019re allowed to be nervous.", "NAH.\n\nYou daughters are making a huge move and it\u2019s changes on top of changes. It\u2019s understandable for them to have their limit.\n\nThe school sounds like a rotating block system. Many schools in the states follow a similar type of schedule.\n\nYour eldest needs to consider what\u2019s best for her for college and beyond. I would see what her goals are long term and then decide what school will best help her achieve those goals.\n\nYour youngest has more time to adapt. I think the bigger issue is how you approach their reluctance.", "NTA If they want to adapt, fit in and make friends then they will need to go to a local school. They won\u2019t build a life anywhere near as well if they are in an international school separated from local kids their age. I think the tutoring is a great idea and with some help and support they will adjust. I\u2019m not sure that a lot of people here understand how isolating it could be for them in the future if they go to an international school. A lot of kids in international schools move a lot and won\u2019t be there in a few years, a local school will let them develop real friendships and a much needed social group and support system.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It GREATLY helped their adjustment, they made a couple American friends amongst their other friends, and the transition went much smoother than if we had thrown them into public school where no English is spoken.

It might be good to start them in an international school like others have said with tutoring to catch them up and while they are getting acclimated.

They will already be dealing with not having any friends. They will be dealing with a major loss of independence. They will also be dealing with a whole new environment and new expectations that go along with transitioning to the way things are run in the new-to-them area. They also do not have your happy memories to draw from and telling the stories is only partially helpful.\n\nGive them time to get comfortable and familiar and get them some good tutors to help with the extras they need to learn. Maybe at some point when they feel better you can take them on a guided tour of the new school system so they can see it, and ask the questions they need answered to decide if they'd like to switch over. But just going over and dropping them in is not going to be a successful venture. You will only make them think they cannot count on you anymore either and feel that they have nothing left.

They need some familiarity at least the first year they\u2019re there. Put them in the international school so they can adjust and then re-evaluate the local school the next year.", "NTA. They can adjust and adapt, they will be fine. They already speak english, can that not be one of the language They have to take to lighten the load a bit?", "Hi OP! \n\nLinguist here, (getting my MA and specializing in sociolinguistics and second language acquisition. I\u2019ve done a paper on heritage language recently, and have been studying heritage language learning since undergrad, as I study in an area where we have many of them (happy to share with you my latest paper, if you\u2019d like to see some formal research. It\u2019s a literature review on heritage speakers and pedagogical strategies). \n\nFirst of all, do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT put them in a polish school. I promise you that, even though your children are fluent in conversational polish, it\u2019s highly unlikely that they have the level of polish needed to go to school in their heritage language. There\u2019s this thing called diglossia, where the brain essentially has \u201cparceled\u201d the different languages into the situations they\u2019re most commonly used in. For your kids, it\u2019s likely that they only have the vocabulary and linguistic ability to express themselves in polish within intimate and informal situations, like that of the family. They definitely aren\u2019t likely to be able to jump right into a schooling involving academic polish, on top of the rigorous course schedule. Trying to learn two additional languages on top of having the dominant language (language they use every day) being flipped is going to be near-impossible.  The cognitive load will cause burnout probably before the first month is over). \n\n Not to mention the trauma of losing their mother (I lost my birth mother young, that shit messes you up. It\u2019s even worse for older children who can remember their mother well. \n\nHere\u2019s what I think you should do in my professional-in-training opinion: 1. Put them in the international school. It\u2019s what they\u2019re asking for and will make the transition easier. And they will be surrounded by polish culture on all sides, so having an American schooling will not put them in a \u201cbubble\u201d so much as give them a familiar home base to make this adjustment. Especially since they\u2019re likely to be in Poland for many years to come- they will have more than enough time to integrate. \n\n2. Once they\u2019ve adjusted, ask them about if they\u2019d like to get into polish classes directed specifically at heritage speakers, so that they can fill in the gaps in their linguistic upbringing and be ready to go to a polish university when it\u2019s time, if that\u2019s what they\u2019d like. This will enable them to be able to live in Poland as adults with a strong capability with the dominant language in academic and business settings beyond just the common, everyday conversational skills they have now. Because being a speaker of a heritage language is great  and has many benefits, but it\u2019s very rare for them to have all the same skills as a native speaker in higher level language settings. Even with a tutor, they\u2019re not ready to jump right into polish school, and it will delay their education. \n\nFinally, an international education via an American school will likely open more doors for them if they decide they don\u2019t want to stay in Poland their whole lives, and want to go somewhere else for work or university. An American-school education at a private international school is, for better or for worse, often accepted in more countries than a local education. I\u2019m not sure about in Poland, but I do know that when I was living abroad in Curacao, my family put us in American Prepatory school, and Americans were actually in the minority there. It was largely locals who had the resources, and other expats from different countries who also put their children there, because the education was prized because of its international uses. Let them go to American school, at least at first, and revisit the topic in a year. They\u2019re already making a lot of adjustments.\n\nI\u2019m going to say a soft YTA. I know you want the best for your kids and are simply misinformed as to how hard this is going to be for them, but the lack of considering their opinions definitely puts you in AH territory. I\u2019m leaving it soft because I know this is a hard time for you too. But if you don\u2019t listen to them now, you\u2019ll veer into hard AH territory.", "YTA. You didn't like school in the US. How do you think your kids feel??", "I am going with NTA. \n\nOne of the additional languages will be English, which they already speak perfectly and will have a major advantage in. Also, your point of integration is very valid. If they go to an international school, they will have difficulties to integrate in the culture and mingle with the locals. I am living in the Netherlands, and I see how all the people going to international school stay among themselves. Many of them are not even speaking Dutch at all. It is a pity, and I would say that it only makes sense to send them to an international school, if they intend to move back to the US.\n\nEdit: I can get that they are nervous about it, but they are capable of much more than they think. Children can adjust very well and learn quickly, if supported properly.", "NTA. They will build better ties to the community going to a local school.", "NTA. They are teenage girls so naturally they are throwing a tantrum because they'll actually have to work in school. But the US school system is a joke.

So you don\u2019t think that losing their mother AND moving to a completely new country isn\u2019t enough of a change for them?", "YTA. This is a lot major life changes. Especially for your 15 year old. You are an asshole for moving them to an entirely different country with an entirely different language away from all their friends. They might \"know\" to speak the language but at a very basic level compared to all the other kids at her grade. Can they even read and write the language? I know people whose parents speak Spanish and they do as well but they can't really read it or write it. You are setting your daughters up for failure.", "NAH\n\nRealistically, this will probably only benefit your 10 year more so than the 15 year, who is a lot further along developmentally. It would be an adjustment for 10f but again, developmentally, she should be able to adjust with structure and discipline. \n\nAs for 15f, she is closer to the age where she would be nearing the end of her formal education but place in the position as if she is just beginning.

My teenagers do A levels at a British school.", "The continents should stay where they are.", "NAH, writing from Warsaw. I can understand why kids are scared but if they speak Polish they can handle a Polish school just fine, it sounds more daunting than it is \u2013 it's more demanding than the American system but it's not crazy, I'm a bit baffled by this thread, people are being way overprotective of kids. If they're really miserable you can transfer them out after a year, but my guess is it'll be fine.\n\nHowever, I would still consider the international school if you can afford it. Those schools have excellent networks and will have way better support for applying to international universities, which they may well want to. Additionally, public schools here can be of, shall we say, variable quality. And the American schools are still mostly rich Polish kids, not expats.\n\nMy guess is your daughters will be thrilled once they realise how much more freedom teenagers get here than in America.", "The American education system is extremely bad. So definitely send them to Polish schools. But maybe let them repeat a year to gain a bit of extra help in catching up. NTA.", "I taught at an American high school (IB curriculum) in Latin America. There were a few dual citizens but almost all the students were locals. It would be more accurate to say that it was a fully bilingual private school for students who wanted to get into US universities. It was definitely an American/English bubble for teachers, but not for students. Look into the specifics of the schools. Many American schools aren't even close to what you probably have in mind, like the ones that were affiliated with the DoS or DoD. You should be educating your kids fully in both languages, especially if they want any chance of getting into Engish speaking universities later.\n\nYTA- This is a much bigger change socially, culturally, and academically than you are acknowledging.", "And this is why we will always be behind other major countries when it comes to education.", "Your daughters are scared. Why not start them in an American school for the first year, and then switch them to a local school after that?", "NTA and I'm telling you this as a Polish person.\n\nFirstly, international schools (the true ones and not the two language ones) are not always created for people who will be staying in Poland in the future and mostly have students that are children of the diplomats businesspersons who spent a few years in Poland and then will be moving again. My two cousins are enrolled in one of those schools and the level of education is horrible, they need additional tutoring to be able to have good scores on matura in future and, what's the most ridiculous thing in all of this, their lessons are based on American requirements, not polish, so they have an hour a week of Polish history and more of American history, in math they're using imperial metrics so they don't know how mutch is a meter and so on. And if your kids want to study at any university in EU they will need an international matura that will require even more additional tutoring.\n\nSecondly, Polish education system is rated as one of the best in the world. Yes, we do learn two foreign languages but one of them is English and it's always  mandatory for one of them to be English so in reality she'll be learning only one. And, if she doesn't want to take matura in the second language she just needs to have 2s in school to pass and that's it. I took German for 6 years, always learned just enough to pass and today I can only say good morning and I don't understand in German. And yes, we have a lot of subjects but it's the same as with the foreign languages - you don't have to be good at them if you're not going to take matura in them. So basically she'll need to be good at Polish, English and math (the required subjects for matura) and 2-3 additional that she'll be taking on matura.\n\nI repeat, GRADES DO NOT MATTER AS LONG AS THEY ARE PASSING ONES, ALL THAT MATTERS IS MATURA!\n\nWhat I would recommend is to sent her to a private school that has smaller classes, teachers have time for every single students because there is only around 20-30 students in a year, and usually you can talk with the principal to create some kind of a special program to help your daughter to keep up with the rest. I was in such a school and it was wonderful to be able to go to a teacher and ask them a question and get a full answer on return and not be in a school where is up to 12 classes of 30 students in a year and you don't even know names of the people in your own class.\n\nAnd even if after a year, or a semester, your daughter decides that it's too much for her, you can always change schools. But I don't think that your children will have an easy future in Poland after the international school of they decide to study here. Because our universities don't look at your grades, or extracurriculars, or anything like that; just matura scores.", "This exact situation happened in my family.

They were already multilingual, but were new to French, so that additional language component was a struggle.", "Or the oldest will fail and stop trying since she\u2019s not going to graduate anyway.", "Much of that fell under elective classes, where I went to school at least. And even those were maybe a semester or 2 (a year or 1/2 a year).", "This is why America sucks", "What province are you in? We did four subjects a semester in Ontario, so 8 a year but only 4 at a time. You had to take English each year but the others were only required for so long, like one semester of PE, one arts course (drama, art or music), family studies, business or shop. 1 semester of Geography and History and so on. About half the courses were electives and you needed 30 credits over 4 years, so room for two spares. It is a lot different than 10-15 subjects all at once.", "Some countries are REALLY HEAVY on curriculum with no electives, and that sounds like the case in Poland. I'm from south American, and the school system in my country is a massacre for most students. I had Mother Language, English, physics, chemistry, biology, math, history, geography, PE. A lot of the subjects were broken down into smaller subsections with different teachers, like biology we had genetics, botanics, etc; language separated into writing (essays), reading comprehension, grammar, etc.\n\nI had classmates who went to the US as exchange students and ALL of them, even the ones who were average students, sailed through the US system. That's not to say my country's educational system is better, I actually think it's insane to push so much content, but it is definetly heavier.\n\nI live in Canada now and what my kids are learning in grades 3 and 4 is definitely behind what similar grades would be learning back home. I do prefer the Canadian system, and not just learning the operational aspect of things but also how to apply that to real life.", "Years*, while I believe the European schools do tend to be better at education, the kids in local schools grew up slowly learning a language and added another and same with subjects, you get used to the standards and expectations and you grew up in an environment where these things and mandatory and normal but a 15 yr old learning 2 whole new languages on top of being behind in a lot of subjects due to more specific teachings that stents taught in America and is going to make adapting to the school incredibly difficult and overwhelming.", "I agree with you that the language will be the biggest issue. They may know and speak Polish with their father, but they\u2019re most likely not well versed in the academic language. That can take far longer to master than conversational/social language.", "From what I understand of American school, you do the same classes every day and you take different classes each year/ term - so physics one year. Chemistry another etc. \n\nThe Polish system sounds more like the UK one where your timetable is over a week and you do everything all at once? You also don\u2019t take things like calculus and Trigonometry separately it\u2019s all maths. \n\n\nBy my understanding they will have the same issue at the international school. I had friends who went to international school in the UK and in Continental Europe ( I did the IB) and international school was still structured the UK/Polish way as, much like the metric system, this seems to be how most countries operate. \n\nNever got the US system.", "If they haven\u2019t been raised in that system then yeah, it might be too hard for them to function in. They may not be able to catch up to their peers.", "I mean yeah if someone was raised in \"easy mode, as you put it, then they would have a really hard time changing to \"hard mode\".", "Ours was mandatory. GSCEs were like our electives except we also got to pick things like media studies, business or digital art instead while we had to keep science, English and maths (alongside having to pick history or geography and religious studies or law or citizenship)", "When I worked in restaurants, with Latinos, at first I was surprised that some were significantly less literate in writing and reading Spanish.", "Fully depends on the school. I had 4 classes a day but 8 classes total and it was block scheduled. I had friends who had 7 classes a day and they were the same classes everyday, then others who had 7 classes a day but a total of 10 that rotated. Plus some are 9 month schools and others are year round. Some have quarter system and others have semester. It\u2019s very much not consistent in the US."]}
