If I feel that I can't go without my dog, and he isn't welcome somewhere, I stay home. It is not fair to bring a dog to an event where they aren't welcome, especially a poorly behaved dog.

I take them with me when I do work on my mother's house, because they can either be in the fenced-in back yard with me, or in an area in the basement that we've cleared out and partitioned off, and where we've put some dog beds, chew toys, and a water bowl. But I would ***NEVER*** take them to a wedding, or even a cookout.

The caregiver finally had it and said that if my ex didn't start taking care of the dog she was quitting and would have their house blacklisted by the agency.
