I explained that I had told her many times before the wedding that the dog was not welcome.\n\nYour cousin embarrassed herself. You and your father quietly asked her to leave when she showed up to your wedding with her dog in tow. She disregarded your request and doubled down and let the dog off it's leash at the wedding. The entire problem was of her own making and she needs to stop playing the victim and take responsibility for her own actions.", "NTA. Service dogs are no joke. And the other dog clearly isn't a therapy dog since it's completely untrained. She just wanted an excuse to bring her dog. Faking medical issues like this is a serious problem. She deserves to be told off for that.", "NTA - And this is where people who have emotional support animals (and I am one of them) need to understand the difference between a service animal (which cost tens of thousands of dollars to train because they perform life saving services) and why they are allowed in businesses and on all transportation and ESA\u2019s. \n\nMy niece has diabetes and has a service dog that keeps her from passing out or going into a coma. She underwent rigorous training with this dog, after the dog went through even more training, all of which was estimated at over $30k. And people like your cousin are why my niece is harassed and side-eyed because she \u201clooks normal\u201d and they can\u2019t always see her insulin pump.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your cousin was so disrespectful at your wedding OP! You did the right thing as her dog was disruptive to everyone.", "NTA.  Service dogs are absolutely allowed to attend anything in my book.  Untrained emotional support animals are at the discretion of the person doing the inviting.  Your cousin is a jerk and it sounds like her dog is a jerk too.", "NTA. If her mentail health was that bad that she needed her dog, she should have just stayed home.", "NTA - an untrained thereof dog is still an untrained animal that causes a litany of problems for service animals trying to perform their job.\n\nShe lost the \"therapy dog\" privacy when she let it roam off leash and jump on people.", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence that your aunt should have taught your cousin.", "NTA. and it's wild someone would say otherwise.  Claiming your untrained dog is a service animal is quite frankly very offensive to people who need and use service dogs.  It also makes service dogs look bad to people who don't know better, bc they cannot safely assume these animals have been properly trained.  Her dog is not a \"therapy dog\", otherwise it would not be running amuck.", "She embarrassed herself with that lame excuse. A therapy dog would be a TRAINED dog.... would know how to not act. How horrible of a person to do exactly what was asked of them prior to the wedding. ugh. NTA", "Your cousin embarrassed herself.

Therapy dogs go visit people to provide support/therapy. The handler is just the dope at the end of the rope. There is no reason to bring a therapy dog to a wedding, unless requested or something. \n\nPS. Therapy dogs have a lot of training too. Sounds like she was thinking of an ESA, which is not trained and not allowed the same privileges as service animals. \n\nNTA. And guess what? Even if it was a service/therapy dog, they did not present appropriate behavior in public and therefore can be told to leave. Your cousin just sounds entitled.", "NTA.\n\nMental health struggles; while terrible for their own reasons, are not excuses for people to do whatever they like.

Your friend with a dog doesn't concern her, you could have had an herd of dog at your wedding, it still wouldn't be relevent to her dog be welcome or not.   \nShe had 2 options: be there without her dog, or stay away. None was to try to impose her dog at your wedding. \n\nYou didn't embarrassed her, she try to ruin your wedding day by her shear entitlement.", "NTA\nCousin was told in advance and chose to put their entertainment over your joy on your wedding day.

I do not understand why people (your aunt) feel that they must jump into the middle of a situation that is none of their business. You did the right thing.

NTA!", "NTA. \nYou told her No in advance. Her dog, if jumping on people, clearly not well trained and a fake therapy dog. A Great Dane off leash and jumping on people is just completely unacceptable. \n\nI can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t see the difference between a service dog and her beast. \n\nIf there were kids there I can\u2019t imagine how terrified they were. Let alone adults who fear/don\u2019t like dogs. \n\nYou owe her nothing except a link that explains what a service dog is and one to an obedience school.

Her dog is NOT a service dog and you gave her plenty of advance notice telling her it wasn\u2019t welcome. I love dogs and excuse most of their behaviors as \u201cdogs being dogs\u201d but a wedding is NO place for them.", "NTA. There is a world of difference between a service animal that performs a necessary task /tasks for an individual and an emotional support animal. If your cousin is unable to leave home without her dog, then she needs to stay home or only go to places where her dog is welcome. She also needs therapy. Your cousin embarrassed herself. She should not have brought the dog with her, and she should have left when she was asked. We seem to be living in a world where claiming mental health issues is an acceptable excuse for bad behavior. Your cousin is an AH and so is anyone else who says otherwise.)", "NTA you didn\u2019t embarrass anyone, she did that all by her selfish self.", "Of course not.  She brought an untrained dog the size of a Shetland pony to a wedding, despite being told numerous times not to.\n\nBlock her and block your aunt.  NTA.", "NTA \n\nThere is a HUGE difference between a service dog and a therapy dog. One is an accessibility device/ extension of the handler.\n\nThe other is for attention seekers to get their tortoise into the Louvre", "# NTA \ud83d\udcaf", "I'm petty. \nBut if her dog had left dirty paw prints. Or ruined any clothing when it was jumping up at people, I would have collected all the bills and sent them her way.", "Also, a therapy dog is taken into places for the benefit of the patients/residents, or occasionally schools after a tragedy. Our local airport has them for people nervous about flying. Was there someone there with a fear of weddings she claimed to be trying to help? There is absolutely no reason a therapy dog HAS to be with the handler at a social event.", "Yea. I was going to say this.  A real therapy dog is well trained, on a leash, and near it\u2019s person.  It isn\u2019t running around jumping on people.  This dog isn\u2019t even well trained. \n\nIt might make her happy but not essential for her.  What she is doing is the equivalent of taking a handicapped parking spot because she thinks her ankle might hurt. \n\nAnd if Aunt had bothered to correct this behavior before ,  cousin wouldn\u2019t have embarrassed herself.\nNTA", "Yeah, this dog sounds like an untrained ESA that the cousin simply calls a \"therapy dog.\" I also hate that people think ESA means the pet can go anywhere instead of Fair Housing regulations for rentals.", "Very unlikely. People with trained service dogs do NOT let them off the leash at crowded gatherings.", "I assumed the later, as it doesn't sound like the cousin called her dog a \"service animal\" until the wedding.", "Therapy dogs do not jump on people. They are trained not to, so no it was not a real therapy dog.", "Maybe, but she was clearly told NOT to bring a dog.  Not only a dog, but a frickin' GREAT DANE.", "The OP didn't yell at her at her; OP and the father told her to leave. She could've left them and there wouldn't have been any scene. But she didn't leave, so the OP lost his temper and that's when he yelled. Also it doesn't sound like he \"outed\" her about her alleged mental health issues @ all; it was the aunt who brought it up.", "Once you let an unwelcome, untrained dog off leash, you get yelled at. I'm also not seeing where OP outed her mental health.", "She made a scene when he brought a dog she was specifically told not to bring. FAFO", "He did yell though. And ESH doesn't mean equal degrees, just that yelling at her and her dog at the wedding was an AH move."]}
