Which I find very ironic given that you had your son when you were a teen, and the father isn\u2019t your husband (because math).\n\nIf your son wants to smoke that IS his choice.  You as a parent can only teach your kids how to make decisions; you can\u2019t make them for them.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to set boundaries and rules for an adult child in your home.

Oh no...she smokes cigarettes out on the porch and works nights? The horror! You can't control what your husband does...if he wants to have a smoke outside with his daughter he has every right to. As far as her eating habits.. that's on her and none of your business. People like to shower and clean up when they get home from work. She'll be out as soon as she's able to get into her own place.

How early is it that it\u2019s disruptive to you and your husband sleep? \n\nAnd yeah, smoking is bad for your health and it would be wise of her to try to quit but you are not going about it in a constructive way and from what it sounds like she was saying to your son that he would have to \u201clive with the consequences\u201c it does not sound at all like she was trying to pressure him into smoking but rather saying that she hopes he won\u2019t start. She\u2019s probably aware that he looks up to her and letting him know that it\u2019s not a habit she recommends. \n\nIf she\u2019s smoking too close to the house that would be fair to ask her to stay away from the windows and doors but that\u2019s not even your complaint.

Or you skipped a few things which were said.\n\nI am a smoker, I know smokers and have known smokers. None of them think \"it's cool\" and none of them would tell anyone else it was cool. It's not cool, it's an addictive substance. The consequences of smoking are you're likely to become addicted to an expensive substance which is sold EVERYWHERE and crave it. Your skin ages faster, your lung capacity shrinks, your arteries fur up faster, you are prone to coughs, you die earlier. you're minutely less susceptable to covid infection (When you catch it the prognosis is slightly better but really not much because... heart disease, smaller lung capacity etc)\n\nHer early morning showers are inconsiderate. \n\n> I\u2019ve tried to keep her on the right path in life\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\nSharing your life experience and lessons is perhaps generous, you don't seem to have any interest in her experience or perspective because \"it's wrong\".", "Yta.\nShe is an adult, she does not need this much active mommying.

You're trying to control what she eats.  You're trying to censor the conversation between her and your 17 year old (waaay old enough to have his own conversations).  She's not staying long.  It's a shame you have to take the opportunity to damage the relationship, not only with her, but with your son and husband.", "YTA, you aren't much older than her for her to think of you as a parent figure. You came around when she was a teenager. \n\nYou're mad at her showering. \n\nYou're mad because she eats what she wants to eat. Like WTF difference does it make on your life. \n\nYou're mad at her for smoking. She is a f***ing adult. A pack every few days isn't that heavy of a smoker. Is it healthy, no. Is it her choice? Yes.\n\nYour son is 17- months away from being an adult and able to make his own choices. Whether helicopter mommy likes it or not. It's not like she was handing him a cigarette and saying, \"Smoke up. You're a man now. \" They were having a conversation about smoking and decisions and the effects. A conversation he should have had 100 times by now in between parents and school. It was a normal conversation between siblings. She was telling him the truth. It will be his decision, and he will have to live with the consequences of it.", "YTA. You might want to ease up on clutching those pearls before you get a hand cramp.", "First, you are 12 years older than her, you are not her parent, nor even old enough to be an adult figure.\n\nShe is an adult! Nearly the same age you were when you married her father. She can make her own life decisions. \n\nHer smoking outside, not really your problem.\n\nHer diet, is not your problem.\n\nFrom your own words, she told your son if he chose to smoke, he would have to live with the consequences. This is true. He's nearly an adult, and will do what he wants, whether you want him to or not.\n\nThe only potential real issue you have is her waking you up when she gets home. Now, perhaps your husband can talk to his daughter about this issue, if he sees it as an issue. Perhaps a white noise machine or box fan will help drown out the shower noise and allow you to sleep better.\n\nLeave her alone, YTA", "YTA. It's not your business on dictating on how she should live with the ways you want her to. She's legally an adult and she has her own rights to choose what she wants to do with herself, not you.", "I'm leaning slightly E S H but I'm going YTA. \n\nSounds like no one had a conversation about how long she'd stay or what the house rules are while she is, but you're also being too overbearing about her life. By all means tell her you need her to take quieter showers or not to slam doors when she gets home if that's what wakes you up, but what she eats should be none of your business. \n\nYou and your husband need to talk about the smoking thing, if he's smoking with her it's not going to help any case you try to make with your son. That said, if he's 17 this is hardly the first time he's encountered a smoker and having someone he looks up to telling him about the consequences probably isn't the worst idea. \n\nAlso consider the fact that \"cherishing your stepdaughter like your own\" may not be the best move here. I'm your age and have friends her age, I can't even imagine trying to parent one of them. Consider that it's time to treat her like the adult she is", "YTA\n\nYou do sound controlling. She doesn't eat what you want, work the hours your prefer, or listen to the specific instructions about smoking you gave her 7 years ago. She was also correct in telling your son if he does choose to smoke he has to live with the consequences that come with it (which is why so many people choose not to). \n\nYou are being hard on her and unwelcoming. You want her to be a certain way, and she is not, so you judge her for it. I can see why there is distance between you two. Well that and the fact that you are so close in age.  \n\n You have to accept her as she is, and be there to offer advice and support to help her towards the good choices (not eating junk and quitting smoking) without forcing it, or getting mad when she chooses something else.", "YTA You are a control freak, and a bully.", "YTA. \n\nYou include her work schedule in the \u201clifestyle choice\u201d category. Do you expect her to magically work different hours while she is at your house temporarily? \n\nPeople shower after work. This is normal. Her eating habits are none of your business. \n\nWhat she said to your son is true and not in any way trying to get him to smoke. What about your husband's choice to smoke? Isn't that a bigger deal especially because he is so much older than you and likely going to die far sooner even without any smoking related complications? Also, I am not advocating smoking, but a pack every three days isn't really that much. She shouldn't smoke, but again, it's her life.", "Lololololol.

It actually opens the door for you and husband to talk to him about the dangers, show YouTube videos of what happens to the lungs (like visual ones, etc. that will stick with him - not ones where they just site statistics).\n\nI hear you on the night shifts, but \u2026 she is working and from what it sounds, working hard. She needs to shower. If it is disrupting your husbands sleep habits enough that it is bothersome your husband can deal with it. \n\nShe may eat junk food because it is quick, easy, and cheap. She is also an adult and can eat what she wants. She\u2019s paying for her own food from the sound of it.\n\nShe is working on an apt, and whether the initial lease went through or not, it doesn\u2019t sound like she wants to be in the house with you and is doing her best.\n\nShe isn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\n\nYou should take your concerns to your husband. And if he wants to let it go than you should to.\n\nShe isn\u2019t doing drugs, having parties or people over, or feeding your son alcohol or cigarettes.\n\nThis is the type of thing you address as a team with your husband - if he agrees with you - and you let him handle. If he doesn\u2019t agree with you, than you need to practice not micro-managing and letting your step daughter be herself, which includes: eating what she wants, showering when she gets home from work, and the fact she told your son there are consequences to smoking is something you should be proud of her for saying.\n\nYTA.", "YTA she\u2019s never going to see you as a parent figure because you\u2019re 20 years younger than her dad.

I\u2019m sorry to sound harsh, but that\u2019s the reality. At her age I had a 2 year old and I was married, she is old enough to make her own choices.

Except, if I had someone living on my property and I hated the smell of cigarettes, I would reserve the right to tell them to smoke somewhere else.

Maybe I\u2019m biased because I had stupid parents, but in my experience, if my parents don\u2019t smoke, that means I don\u2019t get to smoke on their property. Smoking kills 250,000 people per year from SECOND HAND SMOKE. So when the person who is housing me tells me I can\u2019t do it on their property, I don\u2019t think that makes them controlling. The crazy thing is, I was just smoking weed for my digestive disorder. But cigarettes are actually killing the people around you. Also, when I was at home over the summer during college, my parents absolutely were not okay with me showering in the middle of the night waking them up.
