You as a parent can only teach your kids how to make decisions; you can\u2019t make them for them.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to set boundaries and rules for an adult child in your home.

How early is it that it\u2019s disruptive to you and your husband sleep? \n\nAnd yeah, smoking is bad for your health and it would be wise of her to try to quit but you are not going about it in a constructive way and from what it sounds like she was saying to your son that he would have to \u201clive with the consequences\u201c it does not sound at all like she was trying to pressure him into smoking but rather saying that she hopes he won\u2019t start. She\u2019s probably aware that he looks up to her and letting him know that it\u2019s not a habit she recommends. \n\nIf she\u2019s smoking too close to the house that would be fair to ask her to stay away from the windows and doors but that\u2019s not even your complaint.

Or you skipped a few things which were said.\n\nI am a smoker, I know smokers and have known smokers. None of them think \"it's cool\" and none of them would tell anyone else it was cool. It's not cool, it's an addictive substance. The consequences of smoking are you're likely to become addicted to an expensive substance which is sold EVERYWHERE and crave it. Your skin ages faster, your lung capacity shrinks, your arteries fur up faster, you are prone to coughs, you die earlier. you're minutely less susceptable to covid infection (When you catch it the prognosis is slightly better but really not much because... heart disease, smaller lung capacity etc)\n\nHer early morning showers are ~~inconsiderate.~~ Problematic but the disturbance to your sleep could be mitigated.\n\n>I\u2019ve tried to keep her on the right path in life\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\nSharing your life experience and lessons is perhaps generous, you don't seem to have any interest in her experience or perspective because \"it's wrong\".\n\nEdit: Showers are controversial, it seems", "Yta.\nShe is an adult, she does not need this much active mommying.

You're trying to control what she eats.  You're trying to censor the conversation between her and your 17 year old (waaay old enough to have his own conversations).  She's not staying long.

You came around when she was a teenager. \n\nYou're mad at her showering. \n\nYou're mad because she eats what she wants to eat. Like WTF difference does it make on your life. \n\nYou're mad at her for smoking. She is a f***ing adult. A pack every few days isn't that heavy of a smoker. Is it healthy, no. Is it her choice? Yes.\n\nYour son is 17- months away from being an adult and able to make his own choices. Whether helicopter mommy likes it or not. It's not like she was handing him a cigarette and saying, \"Smoke up. You're a man now. \" They were having a conversation about smoking and decisions and the effects. A conversation he should have had 100 times by now in between parents and school. It was a normal conversation between siblings. She was telling him the truth. It will be his decision, and he will have to live with the consequences of it.", "YTA. You might want to ease up on clutching those pearls before you get a hand cramp.", "First, you are 12 years older than her, you are not her parent, nor even old enough to be an adult figure.\n\nShe is an adult! Nearly the same age you were when you married her father. She can make her own life decisions. \n\nHer smoking outside, not really your problem.\n\nHer diet, is not your problem.\n\nFrom your own words, she told your son if he chose to smoke, he would have to live with the consequences. This is true. He's nearly an adult, and will do what he wants, whether you want him to or not.\n\nThe only potential real issue you have is her waking you up when she gets home. Now, perhaps your husband can talk to his daughter about this issue, if he sees it as an issue. Perhaps a white noise machine or box fan will help drown out the shower noise and allow you to sleep better.\n\nLeave her alone, YTA", "YTA. It's not your business on dictating on how she should live with the ways you want her to. She's legally an adult and she has her own rights to choose what she wants to do with herself, not you.", "I'm leaning slightly E S H but I'm going YTA. \n\nSounds like no one had a conversation about how long she'd stay or what the house rules are while she is, but you're also being too overbearing about her life. By all means tell her you need her to take quieter showers or not to slam doors when she gets home if that's what wakes you up, but what she eats should be none of your business. \n\nYou and your husband need to talk about the smoking thing, if he's smoking with her it's not going to help any case you try to make with your son. That said, if he's 17 this is hardly the first time he's encountered a smoker and having someone he looks up to telling him about the consequences probably isn't the worst idea. \n\nAlso consider the fact that \"cherishing your stepdaughter like your own\" may not be the best move here. I'm your age and have friends her age, I can't even imagine trying to parent one of them. Consider that it's time to treat her like the adult she is", "YTA\n\nYou do sound controlling. She doesn't eat what you want, work the hours your prefer, or listen to the specific instructions about smoking you gave her 7 years ago. She was also correct in telling your son if he does choose to smoke he has to live with the consequences that come with it (which is why so many people choose not to). \n\nYou are being hard on her and unwelcoming. You want her to be a certain way, and she is not, so you judge her for it. I can see why there is distance between you two. Well that and the fact that you are so close in age.  \n\n You have to accept her as she is, and be there to offer advice and support to help her towards the good choices (not eating junk and quitting smoking) without forcing it, or getting mad when she chooses something else.", "YTA You are a control freak, and a bully.", "YTA. \n\nYou include her work schedule in the \u201clifestyle choice\u201d category. Do you expect her to magically work different hours while she is at your house temporarily? \n\nPeople shower after work. This is normal. Her eating habits are none of your business. \n\nWhat she said to your son is true and not in any way trying to get him to smoke. What about your husband's choice to smoke? Isn't that a bigger deal especially because he is so much older than you and likely going to die far sooner even without any smoking related complications? Also, I am not advocating smoking, but a pack every three days isn't really that much. She shouldn't smoke, but again, it's her life.", "Lololololol.

I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s also not talking to you.", "yta\n\ni work odd hours and the first thing i do when i come back at midnight is hop into shower, because i'm sweaty, gross, and i wanna be clean going to bed.\n\n...you know, 'cause i'm not a freaking dog.\n\nSay thank you she even bothers to smoke out on the porch.\n\nand trust me, reading your post the reason your son even *wants* to smoke is **you**.", "YTA. For being one. There is no need to explain.", "YTA:\n\n* She showers as soon as she comes in \n* She eats her own food\n* she smokes outside so she doesn't pollute your house,\n* She leaves you alone.\n* She has a job\n\nYour stinky attitude is going to cause you to be a lonely senior citizen.", "Yta do you think your son has never seen anyone else smoke? Like your own husband? \n\nYour step daughter is not disrespecting your house rules. Leave her alone.", "Lady lay off! Who cares what she eats?? And you\u2019re mad she\u2019s taking care of her hygiene and that\u2019s inconveniencing you?! Get some ear plugs or a white noise machine. She\u2019s not doing anything wrong. She can eat what she wants to eat and she can smoke if she wants to smoke and she\u2019s right, she will deal with the consequences of her actions.

She's not just destroying her own body, she's harming everyone else in her vicinity too.", "> Don't shout at either of your kids.\n\nI agree with don't shout at anyone. But imo OP needs to understand that she only has 1 kid.", "It also sounds like stepdaughter is telling son NOT to smoke, that he will have to live with his choice, aka getting addicted to nicotine and having to smoke and go through quitting/withdrawal etc.", "lol, smoking is the son's choice?  naw, OP needs to boot the little chimney out on her rump. Nobody should be required to accommodate a smoker. \n\nAll the other stuff is the daughter being loud and inconsiderate to the people hosting her.", ">Her early morning showers are inconsiderate. \n\nShe is taking early morning showers because she gets home in the early morning and probably doesn't want to go to bed until she's cleaned off any muck or whatever that she picked up at work. Those are just inconvenient rather than inconsiderate. Some have pointed out that the kind of work they have done personally while working the night shift requires them to shower as soon as they get home.", "God you don\u2019t deserve any of these downvotes. You literally just described your own personal experience. Redditors are so annoying sometimes.", "Ha! Yeah, I have quit twice before for a year or more. This time definitely feels final.", "I am done. It was time and I planned it out for a year.", "I stepped down over a year until I got to 2 to 4 a day, only smoking a half or a third at a time and then used Chantix. I also disassociated it from meals, coffee and alcohol so that I had no triggers or routines associated. Honestly there's been no significant withdrawal. When it comes up I tell myself that I can smoke any time I want but I don't want to because it makes feel terrible rather than I can't ever have one again.  It seems to be working.", "It's not controversial at all lol. It is more than bad. And no, I don't think he's suddenly apt to pick up smoking and here's why ( I think it's common sense): for as long as he has lived in that house he's lived with the same 2 adult daily social smokers, as you called them, and hasn't yet. (SD for at least 8 years tho she went to college) This isn't new where the past three weeks two people blow smoke in his face to \"peer pressure\" him, they're just minding their business on their porch. (Note: Mom is jealous of this) I'm not saying it can't happen at 17/18 but the likelihood is lower than 14/15. Personally, I don't see anything in the post that >sounds like they would let him or at the minimum wouldn\u2019t advise him against it (because he is mimicking them)< either. I see a sister telling her brother the consequences of a choice he's almost free to make, right or wrong. We have no idea what he asked or why, but we know she wasn't promoting it because consequences are negative things. I see a father upset that his daughter was unfairly treated, rightfully so. I see an irritated Mom filled with fear, jealousy, and resentment who acted irrationally. Guess all the little, nasty, awful, horrible things SD does ie bathing, eating, working, having to come home, spending time with her Dad when she occasionally smokes, breathing, existing, etc. added up.", ">It's not like the stepdaughter is trying to get him to smoke.\n\nI know. I didn't say anything to the contrary.\n\n>Way to make up things for you and OP to be angry at.\n\nWhat did I make up? I said it wasn't up to the stepdaughter to tell the son not to smoke. it's up to the mother (OP). Where's the lie?", "u/formal-youth6868 is a bot", "Doesn't mean she wasn't trafficked.", "Honestly even working retail can be gross as hell. I'd come home sweaty and covered in all kinds of dirt. Who wants that in your bed?", "Doesn\u2019t mean she was", "My dad used to machine finish parts and every day he'd shower in the \"basement bathroom\" (half finished bathroom in the basement) because he was so greasy we would have had to clean the tub every time he showered.  In the winter, it was part of our chore list to make sure the fire got started downstairs after school to make sure the bathroom was warm for dad.", "Right? Like gee, I wonder why she never \"warmed up\" to OP \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74", "I mean, I can kinda get how a younger step parent could feel that way, even with such a small age gap, she\u2019s had 10 years to gain love and affection for Stepdaughter. \n\nI have a\u2026 cousin? He\u2019s my new steppop\u2019s nephew so I guess that\u2019s kinda a cousin? (Steppop married my stepmom years after my dad passed away, but she\u2019s pretty much my mom in everything but dna so he\u2019s a stepfather I got as an adult.)\n\nAnyway, he\u2019s 22 and I\u2019m newly 35 and omg he feels like such a kid to me. He was graduating high school when I met him and the longer I know him the more fond I get of him in a big sister/cousin kind of affection. I definitely worry about him a lot and want him to have the best life possible. He feels the same way afaik, texts me for advice on cooking and cleaning his place, at family gatherings we chat about his work and yeah I\u2019d say if I were with his dad I might be pretty maternal there. \n\nAnd he\u2019s done some things that drive me batty too, he drove drunk and got into a terrible accident as a teen and I barely slept for all the crying I was doing and praying he would wake up from his coma. I loathe his gf who is old enough to be his mother and get frustrated at him, but I do care a lot for him. He doesn\u2019t feel like a peer, he feels on the level of my little brother (who is life five years older) and yeah. \n\nBut OP is over reaching here. SD just offered advice to her stepbrother and even from the biased angle it sounds like she told him the worst of it. \n\nAnd showering after work? That\u2019s nothing to be pissy about. When I worked night shift my stepmom actually preferred me showering at night because she said if she woke up and heard the shower, she knew I was \u201chome safe\u201d and it made it easier for her to sleep knowing I was home and headed to bed instead of out on the road at night with the late night drunks. \n\nThe smoking it seems SD is being very polite, not smoking in the house. It\u2019s not her fault her dad is smoking with her.", "Plus, didn\u2019t it sound more like the stepdaughter was warning the son that smoking is a choice, and choices have consequences?! She\u2019s being a realist with her younger stepbrother.", "Right?? I\u2019m 34 and I cannot imagine trying to boss around an adult in their 20s. It would just be patronising.", "That isn't what OP said happened - she said he asked about her smoking and she said that it's his choice if he wants to start smoking but the consequences would be his. She should have told him to not start smoking. She has massive influence on him, as the older sibling that he looks up to, so she shouldn't encourage him to make the same bad choices she did. I used to smoke too, but I always told anyone that asked to never, ever start smoking because it's stupid and addictive and really hard to quit.", "Why would you say that? Because I think people should show a basic level of respect in other people's houses? So weird how many people think OP is an AH for wanting her step daughter to grow up and start taking responsibility for herself and the people around her. It's hardly asking too much of her, she's a grown up, she's perfectly capable. I also pointed out where OP was crossing a line and said she should back off.", "Right? How dare I have a contradictory experience from the norm!? Like, pretty sure when someone calls you whenever they have a problem and you bring them to the hospital to give birth when they're a single parent and they TELL YOU THEY VIEW YOU AS A MOTHER that they do? It's not even weird. Her other mother figure was also my age, her step mother. 12 years is not old enough for me to have given birth to her but it's enough to have significantly more life experience.", "It's her father's house though, and if he doesn't care, why should OP?", "Words are hard aren't they", "Yeah, if she ate the leftovers instead, that would be the problem. If she didn't shower as soon as she got home, that would be the problem.", "Why are you assuming he smokes indoors? Does the post say anywhere that he does? No. So stop making up random shit", "No, it really is the absolute bare minimum to not smoke inside someone's house", "I absolutely agree. She's setting a bad example for a younger sibling that looks up to her. She can smoke if she wants, but when he asks, she should tell him what a stupid habit it is and that he should never start. I say this as someone that smoked for 10 years", "So, that\u2019s a yes on the human trafficking.", "I absolutely love the story, and I can totally relate.  Whenever I wash my hands at work I leave a small pool of metal shavings in the sink that I then have to wipe up, because I feel bad for the cleaner who has to deal with me shedding metal everywhere lol. At least I'm only getting grease and chips all over my own stuff at home!", "Let's see, she's finding housing (a nightmare at the best of times), showering once she gets off work (the correct time), eating food that she chooses to eat, working a steady job...  \n\nAnd you have a problem with this why?  \n\nYTA", "She would smoke a pack of cigs JUST in a few days? She only pops up to smoke every few hours?\n\nPFF, she's an amateur. You need to stay around a person who smokes a pack or two in ONE DAY.", "YTA. Seriously I wouldn't want you for a stepmother either.", "Yikes. YOU'RE judging HER? Yeah YTA", "You are 12 years older than her, you have no authority over her, and she is a grown adult. \n\nYTA. Calm down.", "Yes op , the Paramore of good lifestyle choices. Like having kids super young , and hooking up with a guy nearly 20 years older than you. Get off the moral high horse.", "Imagine marrying a man that\u2019s 18 years older than you and having a kid when you were a teenager but yet sit here on some mighty throne is laughable. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t judge someone on their lifestyle choices when you have that baggage with you. YTA", "YTA\n\nI see why your son looks up to her! He can actually ask her questions and ask for advice! \n\nI believe your major gripe with step daughter is that you can't control her. You think her \"influence\" will not let you control your son! Welp, he's almost a young adult, soon to be a non-dependant and you won't be able to control him either!\n\nMaybe revise your biaises against your stepdaughter and learn how to communicate with your son before you push him away", "ESH, everything you said about her is none of your business\n Stay out of her choices, you've already given her advice as a grown adult it's her choice to make. She can smoke and eat bad unhealthy foods if she likes. Looks like she is at least respectful enough not to smoke in the house. You can tell her to wait an hour or 2 to take a shower as she is probably coming in really early. \nHer encouraging your son to smoke is not cool especially since she knows how you feel. Ask her to leave the house as she is correct actions have consequences and this is her consequence for her actions. \nIf you want to be petty and she doesn't listen to delay her shower, then when she is sleeping wake her up and say see how it feels to be woken up. Sucks right? Hopefully you will start to delay your shower so you won't wake us up again. If not this can be a regular thing.", "I was Y T A till the talking to your son abt the smoking part. Why are we gonna act like it\u2019s ok for her to encourage that habit in that kid? Being that he looks up to her, he might start smoking too and while it\u2019s his choice, it\u2019s very harmful and a bad habit.

Currently on my second quit, I\u2019d read something about Wellbutrin making you more susceptible to [strokes, maybe?], so this time I went with patches and gum.

She's been through unspeakable things so she's always going to be a victim, but she's too close in age to me to even consider her a parental figure even if I didn't know the horrible details. Like I said it's not my story and it's worse than I've even said here, if you can believe it.  \n\nMy dad tried to marry me off too from 16 to 25 but he was never able to force me to leave the country and by 25 he deemed me too old.
