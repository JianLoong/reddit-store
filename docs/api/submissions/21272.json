Which I find very ironic given that you had your son when you were a teen, and the father isn\u2019t your husband (because math).\n\nIf your son wants to smoke that IS his choice.  You as a parent can only teach your kids how to make decisions; you can\u2019t make them for them.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to set boundaries and rules for an adult child in your home.

Oh no...she smokes cigarettes out on the porch and works nights? The horror! You can't control what your husband does...if he wants to have a smoke outside with his daughter he has every right to. As far as her eating habits.. that's on her and none of your business. People like to shower and clean up when they get home from work. She'll be out as soon as she's able to get into her own place.

How early is it that it\u2019s disruptive to you and your husband sleep? \n\nAnd yeah, smoking is bad for your health and it would be wise of her to try to quit but you are not going about it in a constructive way and from what it sounds like she was saying to your son that he would have to \u201clive with the consequences\u201c it does not sound at all like she was trying to pressure him into smoking but rather saying that she hopes he won\u2019t start. She\u2019s probably aware that he looks up to her and letting him know that it\u2019s not a habit she recommends. \n\nIf she\u2019s smoking too close to the house that would be fair to ask her to stay away from the windows and doors but that\u2019s not even your complaint.

Or you skipped a few things which were said.\n\nI am a smoker, I know smokers and have known smokers. None of them think \"it's cool\" and none of them would tell anyone else it was cool. It's not cool, it's an addictive substance. The consequences of smoking are you're likely to become addicted to an expensive substance which is sold EVERYWHERE and crave it. Your skin ages faster, your lung capacity shrinks, your arteries fur up faster, you are prone to coughs, you die earlier. you're minutely less susceptable to covid infection (When you catch it the prognosis is slightly better but really not much because... heart disease, smaller lung capacity etc)\n\nHer early morning showers are inconsiderate. \n\n> I\u2019ve tried to keep her on the right path in life\n\nWhat does that even mean?\n\nSharing your life experience and lessons is perhaps generous, you don't seem to have any interest in her experience or perspective because \"it's wrong\".", "Yta.\nShe is an adult, she does not need this much active mommying.

You're trying to control what she eats.  You're trying to censor the conversation between her and your 17 year old (waaay old enough to have his own conversations).  She's not staying long.  It's a shame you have to take the opportunity to damage the relationship, not only with her, but with your son and husband.", "YTA, you aren't much older than her for her to think of you as a parent figure. You came around when she was a teenager. \n\nYou're mad at her showering. \n\nYou're mad because she eats what she wants to eat. Like WTF difference does it make on your life. \n\nYou're mad at her for smoking. She is a f***ing adult. A pack every few days isn't that heavy of a smoker. Is it healthy, no. Is it her choice? Yes.\n\nYour son is 17- months away from being an adult and able to make his own choices. Whether helicopter mommy likes it or not. It's not like she was handing him a cigarette and saying, \"Smoke up. You're a man now. \" They were having a conversation about smoking and decisions and the effects. A conversation he should have had 100 times by now in between parents and school. It was a normal conversation between siblings. She was telling him the truth. It will be his decision, and he will have to live with the consequences of it.", "YTA. You might want to ease up on clutching those pearls before you get a hand cramp.", "First, you are 12 years older than her, you are not her parent, nor even old enough to be an adult figure.\n\nShe is an adult! Nearly the same age you were when you married her father. She can make her own life decisions. \n\nHer smoking outside, not really your problem.\n\nHer diet, is not your problem.\n\nFrom your own words, she told your son if he chose to smoke, he would have to live with the consequences. This is true. He's nearly an adult, and will do what he wants, whether you want him to or not.\n\nThe only potential real issue you have is her waking you up when she gets home. Now, perhaps your husband can talk to his daughter about this issue, if he sees it as an issue. Perhaps a white noise machine or box fan will help drown out the shower noise and allow you to sleep better.\n\nLeave her alone, YTA", "YTA. It's not your business on dictating on how she should live with the ways you want her to. She's legally an adult and she has her own rights to choose what she wants to do with herself, not you.", "I'm leaning slightly E S H but I'm going YTA. \n\nSounds like no one had a conversation about how long she'd stay or what the house rules are while she is, but you're also being too overbearing about her life. By all means tell her you need her to take quieter showers or not to slam doors when she gets home if that's what wakes you up, but what she eats should be none of your business. \n\nYou and your husband need to talk about the smoking thing, if he's smoking with her it's not going to help any case you try to make with your son. That said, if he's 17 this is hardly the first time he's encountered a smoker and having someone he looks up to telling him about the consequences probably isn't the worst idea. \n\nAlso consider the fact that \"cherishing your stepdaughter like your own\" may not be the best move here. I'm your age and have friends her age, I can't even imagine trying to parent one of them. Consider that it's time to treat her like the adult she is", "YTA\n\nYou do sound controlling. She doesn't eat what you want, work the hours your prefer, or listen to the specific instructions about smoking you gave her 7 years ago. She was also correct in telling your son if he does choose to smoke he has to live with the consequences that come with it (which is why so many people choose not to). \n\nYou are being hard on her and unwelcoming. You want her to be a certain way, and she is not, so you judge her for it. I can see why there is distance between you two. Well that and the fact that you are so close in age.  \n\n You have to accept her as she is, and be there to offer advice and support to help her towards the good choices (not eating junk and quitting smoking) without forcing it, or getting mad when she chooses something else.", "YTA You are a control freak, and a bully.", "YTA. \n\nYou include her work schedule in the \u201clifestyle choice\u201d category. Do you expect her to magically work different hours while she is at your house temporarily? \n\nPeople shower after work. This is normal. Her eating habits are none of your business. \n\nWhat she said to your son is true and not in any way trying to get him to smoke. What about your husband's choice to smoke? Isn't that a bigger deal especially because he is so much older than you and likely going to die far sooner even without any smoking related complications? Also, I am not advocating smoking, but a pack every three days isn't really that much. She shouldn't smoke, but again, it's her life.", "Lololololol.

And if he wants to let it go than you should to.\n\nShe isn\u2019t doing drugs, having parties or people over, or feeding your son alcohol or cigarettes.\n\nThis is the type of thing you address as a team with your husband - if he agrees with you - and you let him handle. If he doesn\u2019t agree with you, than you need to practice not micro-managing and letting your step daughter be herself, which includes: eating what she wants, showering when she gets home from work, and the fact she told your son there are consequences to smoking is something you should be proud of her for saying.\n\nYTA.", "YTA she\u2019s never going to see you as a parent figure because you\u2019re 20 years younger than her dad.

How do you think that looked and felt to her? It is absurd to think she would view you as her mom or even a parent.\n\nLet\u2019s go through your complaints, shall we?\n\nShe eats junk: her body, her business. Why are you paying such close attention to what she eats?\n\nShe showers late: kind of a necessity of working late, but it would be reasonable to ask her to fjnf wags to be as quiet as she can\n\nSmoking on the porch: you cannot ask her not to smoke, again it\u2019s her body. If smoking on the porch gets in the house or something because it\u2019s too close, ask her to smoke elsewhere. If you just don\u2019t like it, too bad.\n\nTalking to your son: sounds like she\u2019s actually talking in your favor here. She\u2019s telling your son that it\u2019s his body (true) but he has to live with the consequences of choosing to smoke (encouraging foresight).\n\n\nI am not surprised she doesn\u2019t connect with you", "You're not her mother. Leave her alone.\nIt's her biological Dad's responsibility to speak up not yours. \nSpeak to your son if you want but leave her be.\nGrow up", "YTA. You obviously DO mind her staying there. Chill, she will be out as soon as her apartment is ready - that's likely beyond her control at this point. And why on God's Green Earth would you be upset with her talking to your son *about the consequences of smoking*? YOU certainly don't have any control over whether or not he takes up the practice, but if she can talk to him about how much her habit costs her and other downsides...you should be grateful.", "Wow. Yeah, YTA.  No question. She is an adult you have no input on her damn diet (or her smoking other than to say you don't want it in the house, and she is already going outside). As far as her influencing your son.... he is gonna be a legal adult in a year, and she didn't talk to him about the \"joys of smoking\" , she told him it's a choice he will have to make for himself.\n I won't even address the shower thing because that's just.... I don't have words for someone who gets offended by someone else showering. If that wakes you up, how thin are your walls? (Unless she is walking by your bed on way to the en suite shower?). \nBy your post, it's super easy to see why she never warmed to you. I wouldn't either.", "Nearly over two decades? Let me do the math. Let's give the bare minimum of two decades for sanity sake. So, you were fifteen. For you to have been in her life for that long. Your husband would have had to have met you when you were at least fifteen. Correct me if I am wrong. I really hope it wasn't love at first sight. Anyways, YTA.", "Eye roll, no wonder she never warmed up to you. YTA.", "The heck you mean you\u2019ve always \u2018cherished\u2019 her as your own? She\u2019s 12 years younger than you!! YTA just for that. I can\u2019t even read the rest of this drivel. So tired of troll step mother stories", "NTA. She should not encourage your son to make the same poor choices she does regarding smoking. As for eating habits, you can\u2019t control that and should let it go.", "So\u2026when this girl was 13, her dad married a much younger woman who proceeded to nitpick and lay down the law on her. And I\u2019m sure she was not thrilled about suddenly having a 7yo stepbrother. She is now an adult capable of making her own choices, and whether you agree with them or not is immaterial.", "Yta- you aren't her mother or her parent. You could be a sibling with the age gap that is between you and your cradle robbing husband. She was 100% correct,  smoking is a personal choice adults have, and those who choose to will be living with the consequences. Your son would probably take her opinion over yours any day as they are closer in age and more relatable to each other. Good job showing your son that you are a controlling psycho and making sure he doesn't respect you anymore.", "I don\u2019t think any of the behaviours that you describe are unreasonable. She is an adult. If she wants to eat processed foods, she can. Why is that a problem? She is not for example taking food you had prepared for the next day, She is working, not loafing at home - it\u2019s tough working unsociable shifts z She is an adult, she can smoke if she likes. She does it outside which is the considerate thing to do. Why is that a problem? She wasn\u2019t encouraging your son to smoke, she was talking about consequences of doing so, helping him teason through why not to smoke. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Your son is on the cusp of adult hood. Honestly, I think it\u2019s your perspective that\u2019s the problem. She\u2019s an adult, she\u2019s not 13. I\u2019m sure you are not the only parent - step or not - struggling with an adult child returning home. It\u2019s an adjustment for everyone but you need to treat her like an adult now.", "I just knew from \u201cshes never warmed up to me even though ive been around for ten years\u201d hahahah YTA", "YTA. Your stepdaughter is not beholden to having any kind of relationship with you just because you married her father. \n\nShe was giving your son advice, not influencing him to take up smoking. I half wonder if she smokes so much at home simply to avoid you.", "YTA. I don't think you realize you are judgemental, critical, arrogant, and rude when you speak about her. First, your son is 17, he's grown. He's going to have opinions and make choices for himself that you don't like and his sister was telling him the truth - literally that he can make a choice but has to live with it, possibly for the rest of his life. Second, you said you CAUGHT them talking (seriously?) and her \"influencing\" him. That sounds like you eavesdropped on a conversation that wasn't your business and heard one sentence before making wild accusations. Do you think she was telling him that smoking is super awesome and he should start? What are you convinced she's doing? No adult smoker would ever encourage a nonsmoker to start, get real. You're short of breath, you cough phlegm, it stinks, you stink, there's yellow teeth and fingers, it's stupid expensive, it's gross to kiss a smoker, it's an addiction that controls your life, and is ridiculously hard to quit. I am having trouble believing this post is real.\n\nYou say you cherish her but you don't accept anything about her. You didn't say a single positive thing and made it clear that she's not what you want her to be. You don't respect that she's an actual adult, a grown up with responsibilities, who's in a very brief transition. You clearly can't stand that she has to temporarily share the same space as you when all the woman is doing is merely existing. If I were you I'd apologize profusely and try to do some damage control before anything worse happens.", "You\u2019re only about 11 years older than her, which isn\u2019t much at all. You\u2019re more like an older sister than a mother figure to her, if you\u2019re looking at age. You\u2019re not her mother, she doesn\u2019t owe it to you to act like you\u2019re her mother. And you weren\u2019t around during her formative years as a young child. If you\u2019ve know her about a decade, then you met her in her early teens, so obviously she\u2019s not going to view you as a mother figure or someone to look up too in a parental way. You also don\u2019t have much more life experience than her, so why would she look up to you?\n\nYou\u2019re also mad about ridiculously petty things. You\u2019re really mad because she showers when she gets home from work and eats the food she wants to eat? You sound controlling and unbarring to be around. Even with the smoking, your stepdaughter is right, she can do what she wants with her life and if she makes the decision to smoke, then she has to deal with the consequences of those actions. That decision is on her and she\u2019s old enough to make that choice. It\u2019s not like she was smoking inside the home, where you all have to breathe in second hand smoke. As long as she\u2019s outside on the porch and not lighting up cigarettes inside or near open windows, there shouldn\u2019t be an issue. It doesn\u2019t sound like she was trying to persuade your son to become a smoker, just telling him that actions have consequences, and poor decisions/lifestyle habits can come with negatives. \n\nYou seem so hypocritical, it\u2019s baffling. You\u2019re shit talking your stepdaughter for her poor lifestyle choices, yet you obviously made some poor choices by becoming a teenage mom. How are you any better than her? At least her poor choices can be fixed if she chooses. She can quit smoking if she puts the effort in. She can make healthier food choices if she wants to. You can\u2019t go back on the kid you had in high school. You can\u2019t fix the major mistakes you made as a teen (and I don\u2019t mean this in a rude way).", "yta- no daughter will warm up to their step mom being 12 years older than them.", "Your \"trying to keep her on the right track\" is laughable considering when you were her age you had a 5yo kid & were dating someone old enough to be your dad.

You don\u2019t get to make her decisions for her. Nothing wrong with explaining the risks and why you don\u2019t like smoking but you have no right to say she can\u2019t do it. If you don\u2019t like your husband smoking then you need to take that up with him. Same with your son but again, you can\u2019t decide for him or your husband. As for the showers\u2026 it\u2019s pretty normal to want a shower before bed and if something like a shower is waking you up then you need earplugs or something to help cause this is more of a you problem.
