Liz had a very promising future, she was an Ivy student, always first in the class, beautiful and charming. A few years ago Liz suffered a TBI in a car accident. She doesn't get a lot of social cues, is slow to respond and sometimes throws tantrums like a moody teen. I love my sister, but the easiest way to explain it is that she can act like a child.\n\nI'm getting married to my fiance John (33m) in August. I think almost every girl dreams of her wedding and I'm no different.\n\nI'll put it bluntly, I don't want Liz to attend the wedding. Mom would be hovering over her and she might create a scene during the ceremony or reception. The wedding is at a hotel so I suggested we book a room for Liz so she's nearby, and if needed mom can go check in on her. (And I say this because Liz can stay alone and has stayed alone in the past, so that's not an issue, and she's occupied with a movie or something)\n\nMom said I should be including Liz, at least for the ceremony. I tried to explain to her that I just want my perfect day, but she didn't want to hear it, so I said maybe she should think of me for a minute instead of Liz. Mom got mad and is now refusing to talk to me, and dad thinks I should apologize.\n\nA lot of my friends think I'm correct here, but John said I should be more understanding and this will 'hurt' Liz, and I overreacted with my mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672806635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102tx0e/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_attend_my/", "score": 481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couldn't someone be put in charge to keep an eye on her?", "Info: does your sister want to go?", "I\u2019m going against the grain with a NTA here. If OP is this concerned about an outburst, then it must be super common. It\u2019s of course not the sister\u2019s fault and she can\u2019t help having a disability. But people rarely think of how other kids are affected by having a sibling with disabilities. I\u2019m sure OP has had to make a lot of sacrifices and has gotten limited undivided time and attention from her parents. This is a very special day and she wants it to be about her. Is that a little selfish? Maybe. But aren\u2019t we all entitled to be selfish once in awhile? I think so.

I understand the knee jerk YTA responses, but as I\u2019ve experienced being sidelined at events that were supposed to be celebrations for me\u2026I understand your feelings.

It would be nice to invite your sister, but I can also get wanting the attention on you and your husband at your wedding. Is it a little selfish? Yes, because her sister didn't choose this and it's not her fault. But is it really that wrong to want your wedding day to be about, you know, you? \n\nYou and your fiance decided on this, your mom can voice her frustrations but at the end of the day it's not her wedding.

Every situation is different but it boils down to feeling forgotten and disregarded. OP wants one day where she can shine. Every bride should have that.

My sister, who is also my maid of honor in my upcoming wedding, suffered a huge TBI last year. She had mood changes and memory loss, so I had my bridesmaids help her and learn how to accommodate her needs. It is so cold and cruel to talk about your sister's past accomplishments as if that was a completely different person and she now doesn't have feelings or won't be affected by being excluded.\n\nDo you know how I felt when I found out my sister would be able to attend my wedding? Incredibly happy and relieved that she could still be there for my big day, in whatever capacity. If she couldn't make it, my fiance and I agreed that we would postpone the wedding until she was more stable health-wise. It makes me sad that you have no love for your sister.

I lost my sister when we were both young to cancer and I'd give anything to have had her at my wedding.

Even your fiancee thinks you're being cruel.  \nI find it hard to believe that you cannot find an aunt, cousin, someone, the can kind of babysit your sister during the ceremony and at least the dinner part of your reception.  You sound jealous that your mom has had to care for your sister and maybe you didn't get as much attention. Pretty f'ed up way to think.    \nAll I can think when I read your post is that you lack compassion and empathy.

I would assume everybody attending the ceremony would know enough about you to know about your sister, so if anything happened they wouldn't even be that surprised no? My sister was finishing uni the year I had my accident, her graduation was either October/November and I was in a rehab centre with half a skull. She still made sure I was there.

She done that because it ment alot to her to have me there, and she knew it ment alot for me to be there and see her graduate. I hate to think how you're sister will feel if you do this to her.

No one needs to be the center of attention all the time, but when you're always thrown in the backseat because you can \"manage\" even though it's mostly true, it still hurts.\n\nThat being said OP is an asshole for wanting to completely exclude her- especially considering Liz is capable of being alone. \n\nReddit doesn't know what OPs sister's needs are but I have a hard time believing there is no way she could participate.

We kept it very small, personally I would've preferred eloping overseas but he has a loving relationship with half his parents so I was fine with people being there. \nBut I was also very high strung the entire time. We didn't have kids at the ceremony but at the reception his niece was there. It was a bar like establishment and she was simply being a toddler, making loud noises by stomping on the grates. And it stressed me out the entire time. I'd be in the middle of a conversation with someone and her parents would send her to us which meant immediately any conversation was over and the attention was switched to her. I want to make it clear, I wasn't upset the attention wasn't on me, I just think it's rude to be mid conversation and to have someone cut you off or suddenly drop the discussion. Obviously I'm not gonna be a dick to a child, it's uncalled for and they don't know any better, but I will 100% be one to another adult. Meaning obviously the conversation is done and I'm moving on to talk to someone else without ending the conversation. At the end of the day I got some amazing pictures out of it. But my situation was different, we paid for everything ourselves and didn't ask for anyone to buy us anything, just that they wear shades of purple so we'd look cute in pictures together. :) \nI also have never really cared about my families opinions and don't have a particularly close relationship with them. Which means if I upset someone that day it would make no difference to me. The only person I cared about that day was my husband.

Liz had a very promising future, she was an Ivy student, always first in the class, beautiful and charming. A few years ago Liz suffered a TBI in a car accident. She doesn't get a lot of social cues, is slow to respond and sometimes throws tantrums like a moody teen. I love my sister, but the easiest way to explain it is that she can act like a child. \n\nI'm getting married to my fiance John (33m) in August. I think almost every girl dreams of her wedding and I'm no different.\n\nI'll put it bluntly, I don't want Liz to attend the wedding. Mom would be hovering over her and she might create a scene during the ceremony or reception. The wedding is at a hotel so I suggested we book a room for Liz so she's nearby, and if needed mom can go check in on her. (And I say this because Liz can stay alone and has stayed alone in the past, so that's not an issue, and she's occupied with a movie or something)\n\nMom said I should be including Liz, at least for the ceremony. I tried to explain to her that I just want my perfect day, but she didn't want to hear it, so I said maybe she should think of me for a minute instead of Liz. Mom got mad and is now refusing to talk to me, and dad thinks I should apologize.\n\nA lot of my friends think I'm correct here, but John said I should be more understanding and this will 'hurt' Liz.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So YTA, but you don't have to be and you honestly probably know that. No wedding is perfect, something will always \"go wrong\" but those are memories that in 10 years (probably after just a year lets be fair) you will smile about because they made your day and you can't imagine that you put yourself through that stress over a perfect day.

Its really unfair to let your ONE DAY get ruined", "\"quietly removed\" is not a real possibility with developmental disabilities or TBIs like what OP seems to be describing. The outburst can come from something seemingly innocuous and the attempt to remove them from the situation often makes the outburst larger, as they simply want to vent the frustration and not be taken away from it. It's a difficult situation. I can certainly sympathize with OP, even having someone 'keep an eye' on the sister, it would have to be someone she trusts, which means mom or dad. OP wants her wedding to be about her, which I fully agree with, she wants her parents fully invested for just one day. Having them keep take care of possible disruptions would mean they would never be fully invested in the ceremony or reception, and might lose out on important moments.

So I doubt she has had to make sacrifices her whole life or got less attention from her parents for a large portion of it.", "IDK, by her own admission, the tantrums aren\u2019t super common. Plus the car accident occurred in the last few years when both OP and her sister were adults, so this is a relatively new change in the family dynamic.

She doesn\u2019t have to include her sister in the wedding, but even having something small like a bit of time with her before or after the ceremony would be a nice thing to do rather than have her completely excluded. Or it could be that her mother would latterly be flossing over her sister the entire time and her sister having outbursts and OP just wants to forget about all that for a day and enjoy getting married to her life partner. Just not enough info, but I\u2019d more lean NAH - one wants her wedding focused solely on her and the mother doesn\u2019t want the other daughter to be sidelined - I.e lose even more of her life than she already has and not be included in family events (which weddings usually are).", "> What has she actually done in the past at family events?

Looking back I see how day to day and then month to month he got more tired and less able to manage his symptoms as the reality of the change sank in, he tried doing all the stuff prescribed, people reacted to him and it mounted up. \n\nHe started to become disruptive to the point of some of us saying \u2018do we need to try to decrease the intensity and overstimulation a bit to let him rest?\u2019 I was starting to understand that I was managing my own illness very badly by abled people encouraging me to be the best copy of abled life and having that boom and bust cycle instead of being the best disabled self for my condition. I had a feeling he was similar but it had been only about 18 months for him and he and partner etc were struggling to adjust as is normal.\n\nThen one night totally out of the blue the disruptive switched to violent. He spat on his closest friend, knocked him to the ground in a restaurant and could neither be restrained nor eased down for around a couple of hours. He had to be locked in the restaurant while the friend was taken to the ER. We did not want to call the police as a) the friend is black and b) we were afraid they would not listen that it was a TBI. The restaurant knew him well and rode it out. We tipped them massively but he was not allowed back now this was known.\n\nThe friend was ok and still supportive. I stepped away. I am small, female and disabled. I was now afraid what could happen even though I understood why. I supported my friends by phone and one on one without him. The increase in his reactions was exhausting for him and he started to have fits. It was a vicious cycle and he started to self medicate.\n\nHe died just short of 3 years after the TBI and while there were many factors, pushing himself too much definitely triggered the worsening of things. Easy to say what we would have done in hindsight but he was already a strong personality before the TBI and after it, it wasn\u2019t like you could exactly reason with the way his brain now worked. There wasn\u2019t a best case scenario only least worst options.\n\nI feel guilty backing away but I have tried to memoralise him by treating my disability better since to be kinder to myself and my loved ones. I realised sometimes it hurt to not be able to join in or feel excluded but that at the same time pushing through made me sick, miserable and impacted people for weeks and months.\n\nI started trying to find alternatives so for a wedding I would meet with them after and go through the photos. (Ironically a totally unreasonable adjustment I agreed with myself because I was skipping the fun wedding stuff for the album and slide show but so is life.) Or I send my BF off to a thing I can\u2019t go to with a new t shirt to wear and say \u2018send me a selfie looking hot\u2019. He\u2019d rather I was there but that isn\u2019t a reasonable option so we adjust.\n\nIf it is possible could you get some photos with your sister and mum away from the ceremony or something that works for you? Your mum is also probably being stubborn here because she\u2019s grieving that your sister won\u2019t have these milestones and I might try to use a photo session or whatever to set your boundary about that with your mum. You aren\u2019t your sister\u2019s caretaker nor your mum\u2019s therapist or scapegoat. You are allowed nice things (and shit things!) despite what happened to your sister and you should set out what you\u2019d like your mum to offer and listen to whether she can do that. But you need to express that as about you and her and not use language about your sister that sounds like you hate her instead of having boundaries about how her disability impacts you and your mum. \n\nThen you stick to the boundaries you set over this without being nasty.

You're unwilling to do the smallest thing - mildly adjusting your communication style around her. Just talking softly without using your hands doesn't seem to be such a big sacrifice to make. And to make it worse, even when others like John are voluntarily doing so, you're telling them they don't need to.\n\nHere's my read of the situation - you've always been jealous of your sister, of her life before the accident. And you've just never bothered to grow a single sympathetic bone post the accident.\n\nIf it was just about not wanting a tantrum during the wedding, when you were accomodating and understanding otherwise, I would say N T A, but you seem like a petty, uncaring, shitty sibling.

Hell, I have ADHD, which means I often struggle with volume/enthusiasm (and animation in my movements) control, but even I can keep quiet and calm when I have to in situations like this, I just have to remember to work hard at it - which is tiring but worth it because I care about other people.", "Yeah I was on the fence before, but this makes it YTA for me.", "OP, this comment does make me lean towards a (Y)TA judgement. If your fianc\u00e9 wasn't willing to moderate his speech so that your sister could understand or tolerate him, that would be a major red flag for him. Your saying that you don't think he should have to do it either is honestly a red flag for you. \n\nI understand that a loved one with a significant cognitive or emotional impairment can be challenging to relate to, and I can appreciate that on some level you just really want things to be \"normal\" again, if only for this one special day. I bet your sister also wishes that this had never happened to her as well. But it did happen, and this is how life is going to be, at least for the near future. It's unfair and exhausting, but that's just how it is. I don't know your situation well enough to be able to tell you that your sister could or couldn't make it through your wedding ceremony without distress - if she is very sensitive to strangers and loud noises it might be better for her to be part of a small-scale, family-only pre-wedding ceremony so she is still included but can be happy and comfortable at the same time, and then your parents will be free to focus on you during the bigger, public wedding ceremony - but I want to encourage you to find someone like a therapist that you can talk to about your family situation longer term. Having a neutral party you can offload some of your frustrations to would probably help you to be more patient with your sister's needs and your parents' distraction when you are around them, and someone with training in TBIs might be able to help you work through the resentment that is bubbling up and develop some healthy coping strategies. You need to find a way to make peace with the way that your family life has changed, and to be a part of it in ways that are healthy and positive for you while also hopefully being helpful and supportive for your parents and your sister. I'm sorry that trying to figure all of this out in the midst of wedding planning is intensifying the stress of both, but I hope that you can find a compromise that will allow your wedding day to be joyful for you and for all the people who love you.

If your friends gave you a hard time over needing to look after your sister in that small way, find kinder friends.

She ended up still being able to be there and went into labour a few days later, but neither of us resent that she wasn't able to be my maid of honour and that I was on my honeymoon when she did give birth, because we both recognize that the other person will have life events that it would be ideal to be there for but might not be possible but that it doesn't make our relationship less loving?", "Oh ok", "My brother hadn't sent his save the dates or anything when I found out I was pregnant so it was easy for him to postpone.  They had only scheduled with the church so they lost no money.  If they had been further along in the planning process I would have been mortified if they delayed their wedding for me so maybe that wasn't the best example.
