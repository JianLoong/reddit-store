Liz had a very promising future, she was an Ivy student, always first in the class, beautiful and charming. A few years ago Liz suffered a TBI in a car accident. She doesn't get a lot of social cues, is slow to respond and sometimes throws tantrums like a moody teen. I love my sister, but the easiest way to explain it is that she can act like a child.\n\nI'm getting married to my fiance John (33m) in August. I think almost every girl dreams of her wedding and I'm no different.\n\nI'll put it bluntly, I don't want Liz to attend the wedding. Mom would be hovering over her and she might create a scene during the ceremony or reception. The wedding is at a hotel so I suggested we book a room for Liz so she's nearby, and if needed mom can go check in on her. (And I say this because Liz can stay alone and has stayed alone in the past, so that's not an issue, and she's occupied with a movie or something)\n\nMom said I should be including Liz, at least for the ceremony. I tried to explain to her that I just want my perfect day, but she didn't want to hear it, so I said maybe she should think of me for a minute instead of Liz. Mom got mad and is now refusing to talk to me, and dad thinks I should apologize.\n\nA lot of my friends think I'm correct here, but John said I should be more understanding and this will 'hurt' Liz, and I overreacted with my mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672806635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102tx0e/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_attend_my/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couldn't someone be put in charge to keep an eye on her?", "Info: does your sister want to go?", "I\u2019m going against the grain with a NTA here. If OP is this concerned about an outburst, then it must be super common. It\u2019s of course not the sister\u2019s fault and she can\u2019t help having a disability. But people rarely think of how other kids are affected by having a sibling with disabilities. I\u2019m sure OP has had to make a lot of sacrifices and has gotten limited undivided time and attention from her parents. This is a very special day and she wants it to be about her. Is that a little selfish? Maybe. But aren\u2019t we all entitled to be selfish once in awhile? I think so.

I understand the knee jerk YTA responses, but as I\u2019ve experienced being sidelined at events that were supposed to be celebrations for me\u2026I understand your feelings.

It would be nice to invite your sister, but I can also get wanting the attention on you and your husband at your wedding. Is it a little selfish? Yes, because her sister didn't choose this and it's not her fault. But is it really that wrong to want your wedding day to be about, you know, you? \n\nYou and your fiance decided on this, your mom can voice her frustrations but at the end of the day it's not her wedding.

Every situation is different but it boils down to feeling forgotten and disregarded. OP wants one day where she can shine. Every bride should have that.

My sister, who is also my maid of honor in my upcoming wedding, suffered a huge TBI last year. She had mood changes and memory loss, so I had my bridesmaids help her and learn how to accommodate her needs. It is so cold and cruel to talk about your sister's past accomplishments as if that was a completely different person and she now doesn't have feelings or won't be affected by being excluded.\n\nDo you know how I felt when I found out my sister would be able to attend my wedding? Incredibly happy and relieved that she could still be there for my big day, in whatever capacity. If she couldn't make it, my fiance and I agreed that we would postpone the wedding until she was more stable health-wise. It makes me sad that you have no love for your sister.

I lost my sister when we were both young to cancer and I'd give anything to have had her at my wedding.

Even your fiancee thinks you're being cruel.  \nI find it hard to believe that you cannot find an aunt, cousin, someone, the can kind of babysit your sister during the ceremony and at least the dinner part of your reception.  You sound jealous that your mom has had to care for your sister and maybe you didn't get as much attention. Pretty f'ed up way to think.    \nAll I can think when I read your post is that you lack compassion and empathy.

I would assume everybody attending the ceremony would know enough about you to know about your sister, so if anything happened they wouldn't even be that surprised no? My sister was finishing uni the year I had my accident, her graduation was either October/November and I was in a rehab centre with half a skull. She still made sure I was there.

She done that because it ment alot to her to have me there, and she knew it ment alot for me to be there and see her graduate. I hate to think how you're sister will feel if you do this to her.

No one needs to be the center of attention all the time, but when you're always thrown in the backseat because you can \"manage\" even though it's mostly true, it still hurts.\n\nThat being said OP is an asshole for wanting to completely exclude her- especially considering Liz is capable of being alone. \n\nReddit doesn't know what OPs sister's needs are but I have a hard time believing there is no way she could participate.

We kept it very small, personally I would've preferred eloping overseas but he has a loving relationship with half his parents so I was fine with people being there. \nBut I was also very high strung the entire time. We didn't have kids at the ceremony but at the reception his niece was there. It was a bar like establishment and she was simply being a toddler, making loud noises by stomping on the grates. And it stressed me out the entire time. I'd be in the middle of a conversation with someone and her parents would send her to us which meant immediately any conversation was over and the attention was switched to her. I want to make it clear, I wasn't upset the attention wasn't on me, I just think it's rude to be mid conversation and to have someone cut you off or suddenly drop the discussion. Obviously I'm not gonna be a dick to a child, it's uncalled for and they don't know any better, but I will 100% be one to another adult. Meaning obviously the conversation is done and I'm moving on to talk to someone else without ending the conversation. At the end of the day I got some amazing pictures out of it. But my situation was different, we paid for everything ourselves and didn't ask for anyone to buy us anything, just that they wear shades of purple so we'd look cute in pictures together. :) \nI also have never really cared about my families opinions and don't have a particularly close relationship with them. Which means if I upset someone that day it would make no difference to me. The only person I cared about that day was my husband.

Liz had a very promising future, she was an Ivy student, always first in the class, beautiful and charming. A few years ago Liz suffered a TBI in a car accident. She doesn't get a lot of social cues, is slow to respond and sometimes throws tantrums like a moody teen. I love my sister, but the easiest way to explain it is that she can act like a child. \n\nI'm getting married to my fiance John (33m) in August. I think almost every girl dreams of her wedding and I'm no different.\n\nI'll put it bluntly, I don't want Liz to attend the wedding. Mom would be hovering over her and she might create a scene during the ceremony or reception. The wedding is at a hotel so I suggested we book a room for Liz so she's nearby, and if needed mom can go check in on her. (And I say this because Liz can stay alone and has stayed alone in the past, so that's not an issue, and she's occupied with a movie or something)\n\nMom said I should be including Liz, at least for the ceremony. I tried to explain to her that I just want my perfect day, but she didn't want to hear it, so I said maybe she should think of me for a minute instead of Liz. Mom got mad and is now refusing to talk to me, and dad thinks I should apologize.\n\nA lot of my friends think I'm correct here, but John said I should be more understanding and this will 'hurt' Liz.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m happy that your family was able to coach you and that you were able to be receptive to that. \n\n I don\u2019t know if OPs sister is cognitively able to understand how her behavior affects people around her and situations around her. It sounds like OPs situation and sister isn\u2019t open to coaching and that their mom would be more focused on her sister than on her on her wedding day. \n\nFrom one of OPs comments, it sounds mild (being able to be alone with a movie) but in other respects it sounds like it\u2019s pretty severe (crying over a chair facing the wrong way) but without knowing OP and their sibling, it\u2019s hard to truly know the shape the sister is in.", "No, she\u2019s an asshole.", "TBI stands for Traumatic Brain Injury", "Ok but I do think that\u2019s a bit different then was this op is experiencing. \n\n1. we have no indication that someone would take the sister away when she is about to throw a tantrum instead of coddling her. ( making the ceremony stop until she is calmed down etc. ! \n\n2. the person who would do the taking away seems to then be her own mother. \nDepending on how likely a tantrum is by the sister, that would mean it is very likely for her mother to miss her wedding ceremony and there is not Guarantee on when the mother would return either. \n\nIn my opinion this is an not enough information.", "\u201cAirbrush her sister away\u201d... yep wants to have everything be perfect for a day because of control issues. It\u2019s understandable but icky.", "When she's left alone she's okay, or if she's occupied with something she enjoys. Her tantrums aren't super common but you can't really tell when it'll happen. Usually it's strangers talking to her, or if something isn't the way she wants it, but even that depends. It's just suddenly her mood shifts. She also struggles to do basic things like tying shoelaces, remembering dates, but can tell you all the elements of the periodic table in order.", "I\u2019m going to be very real - the fact you basically are saying OP *has* to let her sister go \u2014 despite the very real possibility of sister disrupting her big day and take attention away from her\u2026 which let\u2019s be real, is what weddings are all about and hence defeating the purpose \u2014 and holding their relationship hostage is so\u2026 Because that\u2019s an ultimatum. You demand OP give sympathy and put aside her wants to cater to sister but sister and you! apparently! seem incapable of having that same sympathy. \n\nSister, and you, are not at fault for having TBI. But, you cannot demand people put aside their own emotional needs to accommodate your own. Why are your feelings more important than OP\u2019s?\n\nNot exactly the same thing since you all were already adults, but consider looking up glass children. Parents have duties to consider the feelings of both kids, but one party is clearly being neglected here.", "If it's right in the middle of the off-script vows or the \"I do\" section, it certainly would.", "I worked for years in a care home on a unit specifically for people with TBIs. Yes. They can be aggressive, rude, loud and frankly inappropriate in many different ways including sexually. They frequently have lowered inhibitions and impulse control. Its fucking sad. They deserve compassion and love and friendships. But sometimes its better not to risk them being inappropriate in certain places. We booked outings where children weren't around. \n\nAnd family can be totally burnt out on dealing with outbursts and choose to not include them in important moments in their lives like weddings. Im sure OP is going to miss having her sister there. I bet if things were different she would love to even have her in her wedding party. \n\nBut life happens and things fucking suck sometimes and its okay to not include difficult people no matter the what their circumstances are.", "Can you explain how someone\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t about them? That\u2019s interesting.", "It\u2019s not ableist to desire a peaceful ceremony at your own wedding. It\u2019s her day.

I hate to see people excluded and I'm unsure if I would make the same choice as her if it was my sibling but I dont fault her.", "Why?", "Being against child free weddings doesn\u2019t make them *not* a common thing. People have the right to have their ceremonies the way that they want them. If she doesn\u2019t want a tantrum throwing sister to disrupt the day, that\u2019s what she gets to choose.

Cause damn you\u2019re dense and blind to miss such an obvious point", "I agree.  Alone with a movie made it seem similar to my condition but further comments made it sound like her sister shouldn't be alone.  I made a longer comment to OP.  Its really about her commitment to her sister.  My friends would probably let me come, outbursts and all.  But that's because they wanted to keep me in their lives and not exclude me.  If OP excludes her sister, which is 100% her right, I fear she is drawing a line in the sand she can't cross back over. \n\nI wasn't prone to tantrums persay but if I felt someone crossed me (which was usually in my head) I was like a dog with a bone that wouldn't let go.  I'd argue all day and all night until the other party just gave up because they realized I was crazy.  I guess that is a tantrum.  Lol.", "I disagree. There are two sides to every coin.  I lost a lot of 'friends' after my TBI. The ones that stayed are rockstars quite frankly.  The ones I lost, that now that I'm back to 'normal' want to reconnect I have no interest in.  They didn't do anything wrong.  I was too much.  The people that stayed had to go above and beyond to keep me in their lives.  They had to suffer because of my actions and make a choice to love me anyways.  Not everyone is capable of that and I'm grateful everyday.", "Okay I get that.  I still tie my shoes bunny ear style cause I remembered that from when I was 5.  Lol.  Can't swoop and loop to save my life.  \n\nI forgot my own child's birthday a few times (not like when celebrating) just could not recall the date, fuck forgot my own a few times too.  But I can tell you the weirdest shit.  I rock at trivia.  \n\nI guess I just wanna say as much as this sucks for you, it sucks for her.  I was always so aware of how people didn't want to interact with me because I was different and it broke my heart.  I was trying my best and just really didn't understand.  I still really struggle.  I don't want you to accidentally burn a bridge you didn't mean to.", "I'm pretty much terrible at empathy because of my TBI so you might be right.  I just know how I would feel if I was her sister.  I think I clearly expressed I am an severely biased opinion.", "Actually to add, I like the term 'holding hostage' and never considered it that way.  \n\nHowever most weddings I have been to, while yes are about the bride and groom, are also a chance to family to get together so maybe we just have different viewpoints about weddings?  I'm fully admitting my opinion is heavily weighted by my own experience.  I don't know if it's right or wrong.  TBIs or just poor social understanding is fun that way.", "I can. Sure my wedding was kinda about my wife and I, but it was mostly about celebrating one of the best days of our lives with our friends and FAMILY who we love. \n\nA wedding day is a long-planned-out party with a thousand moving pieces.

It\u2019s not about you being a shining center of attention for a night (at least it shouldn\u2019t be), it\u2019s about celebrating WITH the people you love. \n\nSure, OP\u2019s sister could have had a melt-down or something. But OP gave no indication that one of her tantrums couldn\u2019t be dealt with. Just that it would ruin her oh so perfect day. Did she try to think of any ways to mitigate a meltdown? Any way at all to include her sister who she\u2019s supposed to care about?\n\nNo. She\u2019s worried about being ooh\u2019d and aah\u2019d over in her big moment.

I explicitly said it isn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d about them.

I feel in that situation could you not then get a carer for the day or something like that. So then the mum wouldn't have to keep an eye but you still don't have to completely exclude your sister. I just feel like even if that is the case there are steps between her being invited and her being disinvited. Unless she literally cannot sit for 5 minutes without losing it, which as I say may be in the added comments I haven't seen, but if that's not the case I feel like there are things that could probably be done to allow for the sister to attend.

I just think she\u2019s the AH for doing it!", "For me it\u2019s a cultural thing. Here a wedding is the epitome of a family celebration and excluding children just feels weird.\n\nI\u2019m 45, have been to a ton of weddings and hadn\u2019t even heard of the concept of a child free wedding before I found reddit.\n\nBut there\u2019s a ton of stuff different compared to weddings in the US (non open bars, the massive photo shoots, the focus on the bride instead of the guests etc.) so to each their own.\n\nEdit: Are you really so into child free weddings that you downvote someone describing something different?", "I think it\u2019s strange to exclude family members when a wedding is about two people deciding to create their own new family (even if it\u2019s just the two of them and they don\u2019t plan to have children). Family is kind of the whole point!", "Interesting.  If the sister had a Total Brain Injury I would expect her to be comatose (just based on what \u201cTotal\u201d means to me).  Now I\u2019m curious and will go see if I can find out more.", ">I don\u2019t care how \u201cbad\u201d her sister is. \n\nWell, within reason, but I presume you're being hyperbolic.  \n\nOP's sister doesn't seem to be a high risk of major disruption though, so she should be invited.", "You say this like family members are always close because they\u2019re family. You clearly don\u2019t understand how fucked up some families are. Like I said, I could be wrong if OP is oblivious, which after consideration is more likely than my original statement. But again, if the sister is really that bad, it\u2019s not her fault that she isn\u2019t getting the attention she needs.", "Then YTA, you\u2019re both adults but she is unable to care for herself and not by her own choice.", "I get that. Honestly my knee jerk reaction is mostly because of my experience. My extended family would be mortified, and I think the question \u2018where is OP\u2019s sister\u2019 would be brought up by each and every uncle, aunt and cousin. I really don\u2019t think they would like the answer.\n\nBut we are a whole lot of Catholics from Irish descent so we stick together.", "Yep I can agree with all of this too. I had a series of mild TBIs that ended up causing long term effects. \n\nI can\u2019t consistently remember my own address but I can tell you birthdays of people I haven\u2019t seen in a decade. Memory works strangely when it\u2019s not firing on all cylinders. \n\nI would feel pretty devastated if I were left out. But I\u2019m not understanding why the only option is she doesn\u2019t come or your mom is responsible for her. Does she have a PSW or even friends or another family member who\u2019s good with her?", "I think it's more complicated when you're talking about siblings and one sibling is the one getting married and the other is high needs, because OP's mom is going to invariably be more focused on Liz than on OP on OP's wedding day if Liz is there.", "Well everyone has different ideas of what weddings are about. To me, it\u2019s celebrating the bride and groom, and having them remember their day. It seems OP feels the same way. I wouldn\u2019t want tantrums thrown during my wedding. It\u2019d ruin the day. It may sound mean, but it\u2019s true.", "Excluding someone from your wedding, your expensive special day, because they throw tantrums is a great reason, regardless of why they throw tantrums. The disability isn\u2019t relevant. The actions and event at hand are relevant.

It's a celebration of 2 romantic partners. Loved ones are invited to celebrate an important occasion for these 2 people, and that's it, not to celebrate anyone or anything else. This is not a celebration of sisterhood or siblings or the family OP grew up with.\n\nI think starting a new tradition of a party to celebrate your entire family sounds great btw.", "I didn\u2019t down vote anything. I was just curious.", "I thought it was about the couple.", "No! Not within reason! We aren\u2019t talking about someone who is behaving badly within their control. We\u2019re talking about a sister with a disability! \n\nShould there be a plan if things go awry? Absolutely! But unless her sister is a danger to herself or others at the wedding, she should be invited.", "There is zero indication about a bad relationship here and lots of indication of a bride wanting to hide away her disabled sister because of some petty fear of ruining her \u201cperfect\u201d day. We can only judge what\u2019s written and what\u2019s written is a lot of prejudice.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think OP is the kind of person I\u2019d want to celebrate, and if one tantrum is enough to \u201cruin the day\u201d, I\u2019d rethink marrying that person altogether. Honestly, comments like yours make me really sad for humanity.", "It is not about celebrating the whole family but the whole family (and friends etc.) are celebrating the occasion.

Plenty of parties are child free, not just some weddings.", "Because it\u2019s good to include family members in big life events such as weddings. \n\nIt\u2019s not about understanding the proceedings, it\u2019s about everyone being together to celebrate a major event. \n\nOf course there should be a plan to accommodate disruptions!

Not sure what you\u2019re getting at?", "I see your point.  Bit too idealistic for me however.   I have no problem leaving babies, screamers, and rowdy drunks out of such events, if desired.  There's no point making everyone else miserable.", "Childfree weddings are not rare.", "I hope you aren\u2019t referring to someone who is disabled as a \u201cscreamer\u201d because that\u2019d be incredibly offensive. \n\nAnd idk man, if a baby briefly crying before their parents take them out of the room makes you miserable, i think you just gotta get over it. \n\nRowdy drunks? Absolutely, leave em at home, totally get that. But that\u2019s a little different than a baby or a person who is disabled."]}
