I also don\u2019t use grammar on a daily basis, so I apologize if I make any mistakes.\n\nContext: I (17f) am in a friend group with 3 other people. I won\u2019t use their real names, so they will be known as Jane, Jill, and Jocelyne. We are all around the same age, Jocelyne being the oldest and a year older than the rest of us. Jill is the most athletic in our group, and normally jokes around, tackling us and basically doing stuff like throwing grass at us and hitting us pretty hard in the back. I am mostly targeted for this, and I\u2019ve learned to get used to it even though I don\u2019t like it. I am also the most sensitive in the group, so that will probably make the story make more sense. \n\nMoving on to the actual story, we as a group decided to hang out over the summer, and the first thing we did was to get ice cream. That part was normal, nothing out of the ordinary happening. We decided to take our ice cream and walk to the park, which was only a few blocks away. As we get there, we see 3 other people we know from school, all hanging out. One of them has a water g\u00fbn, and when they see us, they start running after us. All fun and games, right? That is, until the one with the water g\u00fbn shoots me in the back with it when I\u2019m not looking. By this point, I just want to go home. As I\u2019m wiping my face, trying to hide the fact that I\u2019m crying, I hear Jill say \u201cI\u2019ll pay you 5 bucks to shoot her again.\u201d Before I have time to block it, she shoots me in the face with the water g\u00fbn. Jill scrambles to get her money and says \u201cI only have a 10,\u201d implying that she would give the whole thing if the girl with the water g\u00fbn shot me a third time. So the third time, the water hits my side. At this point, I\u2019m crying and passing it off as the water dripping from my hair. Jill is the most satisfied of the 4 of us, saying it was so funny as we leave. The others in the group decide to go to target, which at this point, I wasn\u2019t so willing to go with them but went anyway because I didn\u2019t want to be left out. Keep in mind, I am the only one who was shot by the water g\u00fbn. So we go to target, buy some stuff, and leave. \n\nThis all made a big impact on me, considering that I really thought these were the people I would die with. I also felt hurt by the fact that the other people in our group (Jill and Jocelyne) did nothing in my defense and also passes it off as a joke. We originally were planning to hang out again around my birthday, also in the summer, which is coming up, but now, I don\u2019t really want to go with them. My other friends that don\u2019t go to the same school as me and I haven\u2019t seen in months are inviting me to hang out also around my birthday, and I really would rather go. \n\nSo am I the asshole for dropping my plans with my other group because of what happened?", "created_utc": 1686432963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146bu81/aita_for_dropping_my_plans_with_my_friend_group/", "score": 130, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you are the sensitive (maybe oversensitive at times?) one in the group, and Jill is well aware of it and enjoys torturing you a bit.  That's not cool.  Jill's an AH and a bully.  Tackling people, hitting their back, all not cool.  So yes, I think you need to work on your strength and assertiveness and part of that is telling Jill to knock it the fuck off and back off.  You'll get more comfortable with being assertive as you get older and as you practice being assertive.  If you lack confidence, start doing things that make you feel good about yourself, like pursuing interests, talking to new people.", "NTA. People (and teenagers in particular) often underestimate how unpleasant it can be to be the target of what in isolation could be lighthearted fun but cumulates into bullying. It may be worthwhile to discuss with Jill how you feel, although if it's not innocent behavior turned into a burdensome habit that may backfire. You also might want to talk to Jane or Jocelyne so that they know you don't like this and can stick up for you when you're too busy dealing with what's going on to take control of the situation. Choosing to spend some time with friends who you are more comfortable with is a good idea, and maybe spending time with people who respect you more will give you some new perspective to bring back to Jane, Jill, and Jocelyne.", "NTA in the slightest. These aren't real friends, they're bullies taking advantage of your gentleness. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your feelings and emotional well-being should be a priority.

I also feel like crying (my sensitivity haha) every time I mention it, so I\u2019m not sure if I should confront her about it.", "I have tried in other situations, but what happens always gets passed off as jokes, so I am scared that this will be the same case. I am also not that comfortable around the girl who paid the other girl, and I never have been, and the other people in the friend group think that I for some reason \u201chate\u201d her, so they never take me seriously.", "Agreed. Everything is (was) more dramatic in high school and someone who is very sensitive,  it's 10x more so. It's highly unlikely you will end up friends with these kids after high school. Heck, my ride or die bestie from that time lives 5 minutes from me and I have seen her once at the grocery store. Life moves on and you will be okay. \n\nIn the meantime, you have to learn to advocate for yourself. Truthfully, I was you in high school, and until I stood up for myself,  that stuff happened. After I stopped allowing it to happen there was some blowback, but those same people came back around because they also liked me with a spine. \n\nSo do this... and it's cheesy but stick with me. Go stand in front of a mirror and practice what you should have said and a few more replies. Once you get over the weirdness of saying it, it gets easier. That being said,  you can also just walk away and not say anything.  Either one works,  but I wouldn't waste my time with these kids unless they apologize.", "You are right, except that I didn\u2019t even get a warning and I\u2019m already not comfortable around the friend who paid the girl with the water gun to shoot me 2 more times.

I feel for you - this sounds a lot like something I struggle with: I absolutely hate people throwing or aiming things at me, even as a game, even if it\u2019s soft, even if it\u2019s not going to hurt, even if they\u2019re someone I get along with most of the time. Hate. It.   \n\nNerf guns, water pistols, a tossed teddy bear, ball sports, a piece of crumpled paper - anything moving rapidly towards my face or head freaks me out. I can\u2019t help it - I flinch and get upset every time and I have for *years*. Decades even.   \n\nAny time I\u2019m in a situation where things are flying at my head, I get extremely angry and also extremely teary. I was told a lot growing up that I was sensitive (or \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d to be exact). And now I\u2019m in my 40s, you know what I\u2019ve realised?   \n\nFirstly: there is nothing wrong with \u201cbeing sensitive\u201d. You are allowed to set the standard of what is and is not acceptable treatment of you. That\u2019s your prerogative - people can disagree, mock you, be exasperated, call you a party pooper, call you high maintenance. Whatever. But you ARE ALLOWED to say what you will and won\u2019t put up with. Being sensitive is not a bad thing. And even if it were, you don\u2019t have a lot of control over it. You are who you are.  \n\nSecondly: when people say \u201cyou\u2019re so sensitive\u201d often this really means \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact I can\u2019t treat you however I want, with no repercussions. I don\u2019t like that I can\u2019t treat you like crap without you objecting.\u201d   \n\nKeep an eye out for these sort of people - they want to treat you that way because they are unhappy and hate it, and think they can feel better by making others feel worse. Those sorts of people are not good people to be around. You will keep meeting them in life, unfortunately. But you will learn fast how to spot them. Listen to your gut. Examine how people who make you feel gross treat you.   \n\nYou don\u2019t have to hide the fact you feel betrayed, upset, angry, hurt, tearful, confused or anything else, just to qualify as \u201cgood enough\u201d to hang out with people who are being cruel to you. You can and will get better friends who are as tender and gentle as you - human traits that are incredibly important and beautiful.\n\nSomething that might be of interest to you - I was recently diagnosed with autism. In my reading and research, I kept seeing a common theme: of women like me being described as \u201csensitive\u201d. I understand now that my brain translates a lot of unexpected and loud/fast stimuli as pain, and I am easily overwhelmed especially when things are happening quickly. Maybe this is something worth looking into for you.  \n\nDitch these girls. The price they are asking you to pay is not worth it. You don\u2019t have to be treated like crap just to have friends. It may take time to find others who\u2019ll treat you how you want - so in the mean time, be as good a friend to yourself as you can, OK? You\u2019re worth it.", "NTA. \"I'm really hurt and upset by what happened and I need some time out. Enjoy your summer.\" Make some new friends. These ones are trash.", "NTA\n\nStop hanging around with bullies and bully enablers. \n\nYour \u201cfriends\u201d have been gaslighting you. And they are NOT friends. \n\nThey are completely ignorant of what being \u201csensitive\u201d actually means. \n\nYou are not \u2018sensitive\u2019 because you don\u2019t want to be picked on and bullied. That\u2019s not what \u2018sensitive\u2019 means. \n\nBeing sensitive is something completely different, like being kind to others who are in pain. Sensitive people go out of their way to be aware of how others feel and to help them feel good and cared for. I have no doubt you ARE sensitive, in the true sense. \n\nThey\u2019ve weaponized the word \u2018sensitive\u2019. What they mean is \u2018how dare you feel sad and upset when we\u2019re bullying you. Any reaction means you\u2019re weak and inferior\u2019. They misused the word to gaslight you into feeling inferior for responding appropriately to bullying. \n\nJill is an AH for her behavior. You should not have to tell someone more than once to stop playing idiotic pranks or being physical with you. None of her behavior is acceptable as it is unwanted. \n\nPlease drop these jerks. You deserve better.", "'I also don\u2019t use grammar on a daily basis'; you regularly have days where you don't write, speak, read or even think in full coherent sentences?", "Jill is a bully. She is and has been bullying you. This is not okay. Friends don't act like this. You are NTA in any way, and I'd frankly never speak to Jill again.\n\nWhether Jane and Jocelyn are worth keeping in touch with depends on if they admit Jill is a bully.", "This girl in not your friend, I think you should drop the 3 of them and find some new friends.\n\nNTA", "They  like to have \u201ca friend\u201d to bully. You are a toy for them to laught at. \nGo out with people who real like you and NC with this group", "Except they\u2019re not really doing it to be friends, they use the poor girl as a punching bag. And if they do this type of crap all the time, no wonder OP is \u201csensitive\u201d - she\u2019s being bullied by her social circle all the time. She\u2019s communicated several times in the past as well as she can that they disregard her boundaries and upset her and they disregard her. I agree she needs to work on communication/confidence, but brushing her off and saying it\u2019s not a big deal isn\u2019t the way to go about it.\nAnd 17 is well old enough to understand the difference between a joke and bullying - this was obviously done with malicious intent. The kids with the water guns may not have fully understood this wasn\u2019t a game, but her \u201cfriend\u201d did."]}
