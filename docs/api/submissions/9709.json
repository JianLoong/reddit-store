{"id": 9709, "submission_id": "10zpq4p", "title": "AITA for disliking my SIL?", "selftext": " Ok so first off I wanna say I actually really liked my SIL Sarah (F26) at first, but after my then bf Ryan (M30) now husband moved in with me she got worse. \n\n After Ryan moved in, she decided to come and visit to have a weekend with us swimming, and doing summer activities. I like hosting people at our house so I was pretty excited. I never had any sisters so I was also excited to have a SIL and some girl time. Fast forward to the stay at our house- she refused to pick up after herself, she complained about everything, and she disrespected me multiple times. When I say disrespected I mean she talked over me every time I tried to talk to my husband, left dishes around the house, acted like a child when she didn\u2019t get her way. She basically acted like I was her mom the whole weekend. This was just the first visit. She came to visit multiple times after each one getting worse and worse until my husband Ryan and I got into a huge fight on her last visit. \n\n This last visit was the final straw with me. She stayed about 5 days and it was the worst visit yet. This visit was during Christmas and New years. We had a horrible winter storm a few days before Christmas and had gotten way worse by Christmas Eve. SIL called my husband to demand he takes her to the airport in his car with no 4wheel drive in an ice storm even though she drives and SUV. SIL then proceeded to cry when he told her no. Her flight got cancelled so she came to spend Christmas with us which is fine, but she ended up coming with us to my parents/families Christmas. \n\n My parents welcomed her in with open arms and were nothing but nice to her, but once we got back to our house she talked shit about my mom who was kind and sweet and called her a bitch for no reason. This made me mad but I didn\u2019t say anything she continued to complain about everything she could find to complain about. \n\n She stayed until we had to go to work for the next week and when we went to bed she decided at midnight she was going to do laundry she was slamming the washer door, slamming doors, walking around the house stomping around leaving every light on. My husband wakes up at 5 AM so he was kind of irritated and told her that she needed to be quiet. \n\n The fight we got into was because I had finally had enough and was being quiet and kind of passive aggressive towards her, and my husband told me I was being a bitch for acting like that even though he completely agrees with me when she\u2019s not around. \n\n There\u2019s definitely more to the story that she\u2019s done but I don\u2019t wanna make this post too long when it\u2019s already long enough I just wanted to vent. I don\u2019t want to cause any issues between him and his sister because that\u2019s his only sibling but she frustrates me and I really don\u2019t like her I kind of cringe whenever I hear her voice or see her call. I know I sound a little mean but am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1676129344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zpq4p/aita_for_disliking_my_sil/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't get to disrespect you after allowing her into your home. Wtf?  I'm guessing she was probably always the golden child, and is of the mind that what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine....", "NTA.  Your SIL is completely disrespecting you and your household and your husband is allowing it to happen.  Thus, you have a husband issue.  He should have put his foot down after the first visit with rule of behavior for SIL.  You should not have to deal with SIL antics after the first visit.  You need to talk with you husband about his sister's behavior and his lack of support in this matter.", "NTA, She sounds like an absolute freaking nightmare. And frankly, I would have banned her from my house long ago. You are not the asshole at all, your SIL is and, frankly, your husband is for allowing this behavir. You have a very long life ahead of you with your husband unless you put your foot down about his sister now. Otherwise, this will be your life.", "NTA. Your husband has to set and maintain healthy boundaries with his family, including his sister. \nWatch youtubes on how to do it. \n\nYou can set healthy boundaries with your husband that you are no longer going to host SIL. He can visit her at her house. Or she can visit while you are at your parent's house. \n\nTry to keep a cordial relationship with her, just do not do overnight visits with her. \n\nYour husband should tell SIL she needs to Apologize to you for calling your mom a B.", "Thats exactly what it is! Shes the baby and shes always gotten what she wants when she wants it.", "NTA But you are going to have a long relationship with her.  Try to rise above and create a situation where you can all get along.   How you behave and how you ask her to treat you is a big part of how she behaves.  Think logically, be kind, be polite, set limits.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Unfortunately she couch surfs because she refuses to work and we wont pay rent for her so she just stays with friends and he cant really visit her house. I do think he needs to establish some boundaries. I really have no problem with her  visiting as long as shes cordial.", "I am very polite to her I dont say much about anything. Its just hard to deal with the disrespect in my own home. I don\u2019t stoop to her level, but I will try to set better boundaries in a polite way! \ud83d\ude0a", "It seems like part of the problem is that she is in your home at all.  You can have a relationship without her staying with you.  If she does want to come in the future, you need to kindly have a conversation about how that's going to work, but frankly I just wouldn't have her over.  I'm hoping that you can have a good relationship that's more distant and maybe as she matures things will improve.", "Holy hell, she called your mom a bitch and she's still breathing? You are a better person than I, OP. Soon as that went down your husband would have been down one sibling. NTA.", "NTA. she is the adult. It is common sense: you comply with house rules or you rent Airbnb/hotel for yourself if you disagree with the routines there or are in any way uncomfortable. And hosts who accept you aren't your hired stuff.", "Oh believe me I wanted to do some very unsavory things I was so mad \ud83d\ude05. I just love my husband to death and am trying to mitigate the problem and I know that would make it worse. Im right there with you though I felt like doing that.", "\"Husband, I love you.  We are at an impasse, it seems. You see, I feel as though I have been tolerant, but my mother's honor has been besmirched. Therefore, you can either confront your sister about her unacceptable behavior, OR I can put her head on a pike. The decision is yours, my love.\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 oh goodness! Not gonna lie that may be my exact words! She is his baby sister and they were always very close so Im kind of wondering if maybe shes a little jealous of my husband and I\u2019s relationship which is why she acts out at me to push my buttons. I know that sounds nuts but she really does act like a teen girl who doesnt like her big bros gf.", "I don't know why but as I typed this I definitely heard it in Lazlo's voice from What We Do In Shadows hahahha", "Oh then I could ABSOLUTELY see this as being the case. I had 3 older brothers I was close with and when the oldest got married (first to do so of course) I won't lie, my 9 year old self had a \"moment\" at the wedding reception (honestly, *childhood me* reinforced my childfree status \ud83d\ude02) for exactly that reason - she was, in my stupid young mind, \"stealing my brother\". If this woman is an emotional child still, regardless of physical age, she may well be thinking in those terms, whether she realizes it or not.", "I too am a little sister so I get that aspect \ud83d\ude02 I did not like my brothers first gf either when I was you know\u2026.12 \ud83d\ude05. I think she just has yet to grow up. When someone is older than you and acts like a child (Im 22) its hard to overlook them but I think I need to try my best to confront the issues as though she is a teen girl lol.", "Yeahhh.... unfortunately age and EQ don't always match up. That said, it's no excuse to call anyone's mom a bitch. Hubby needs to stop coddling her. Nothing will change if boundaries and consequences aren't enforced. And he needs to understand it's for HER own good that she needs to grow up and understand this - not everyone is going to be as understanding as you are about her behavior issues.", "I unfortunately (even in my own family) have to deal with a lot of adult that act like children so I try to be understanding of his family since he puts up with mine, but they aren\u2019t as bad as her. Luckily he does agree with me she should apologize for that. It is unfortunate so many peoples age does not match their personality or IQ.", "EQ is tough... that's *emotional* intelligence. Not taught in schools sadly. It's sort of just assumed all of us will just learn things like emotional identification and self-regulation on our own without explicit instruction... Fortunately there's an increased awareness of neurodiversity but the fact is, EVERYONE can benefit from explicit instruction in this from a young age, and it just frankly isn't done. A lot of people don't have great role models at home for it on top of that so It becomes a cycle of poor emotional management.", "It is tough. EQ should be taught in schools to teach children from a young age how to cope with their emotions. Im thankful there\u2019s more attention being brought to the psychology behind why people act the way they do. The only bad part about that is you feel like an asshole getting mad at someone once you understand why they are the way they are \ud83d\ude02.", "I'd offer to go stay somewhere else every time she visits until he gets it in his head. \n\nNTA but it looks like she pushes boundaries because no one calls her out on it (or I guess they stop after she cries). Either way time for her to grow up but that lesson is not yours to teach.
