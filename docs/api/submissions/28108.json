It sounds like your brother may be depressed given that he was in bed at 4:00.  I'm not factoring in the idea that he wouldn't come out of his room because, frankly, with those women there, I wouldn't have come out, either.\n\nYour mom is TAH.  I get that they were upset when they initially made their comments to your brother.  Things do get said in the heat of the moment.  They shouldn't, but they do.  What I cannot understand is why she allows people to come into her home and make those comments about one of her kids and actually thinks they are her \"friends.\"  She should have been the one throwing them out, but since she wasn't, I'm glad you did.\n\nBoys often mature more slowly than girls.  Seriously, their brains don't develop as quickly.  It sounds like Leo just hasn't figured out who he is/what he wants out of life just yet.  Not everyone has to go to college.  Not everyone *should* go to college (and I say that as a former teacher).  The idea that anyone should write Leo off at this stage of his life is utterly unacceptable.  I do think you should keep an eye on Leo, though.  I think he may be silently suffering from depression and this accident and the comments he's gotten because of it are only piling on to make it worse.

Is there someone she would listen to (mother, aunt, sibling, respected cousin or life partner) who could really talk to her about why she needs them badly enough to destroy one of her children?  Is there anyone she can reach out to to hang with who's around her own age?  If not, are there any local groups that interest her, and might provide her with like-minded acquaintances?

It's definitely good that you and your sister are doing what you can for him.\n\nThe problem is your mum's friends, though. Their comments have probably been getting to him for a long time now, he's just been doing his best to ignore it.

I can\u2019t say what I would do if my friends did to my kids or grandkids, I would get banned, sounds like these ladies have nothing positive in their lives so they make drama to feel alive. Get your brother out of the house. A counselor, relative or someone may be helpful", "Usually a middle child is the least likely to be an affair baby, but I do wonder with this dynamic.", "Nta. As some would say they deserve an alcoholic rage beating for that.", "Your parents set this standard & by not condemning it they condone it. They owe Leo a serious apology & need to get new friends. NTA", "As a mom, I can\u2019t imagine allowing a \u201cfriend\u201d to disparage my child in my home. You have really disgusting parents, OP. They should be deeply ashamed of themselves.\n\nGood on you for sticking up for your brother because it doesn\u2019t sound like your garbage excuses for parents ever do. (No offense)", "NTA, Leo needs to know he has someone in his corner and know he knows it. You were the only one who stuck up for him. Your mom should lose her dumb friends cuz karma. Maybe next time she\u2019ll stick up for her family over some shitty assholes who don\u2019t gaf about her anyway", "Is there any options for getting Leo moved out of your parent's house, and into therapy?  Leo sounds like the scapegoat kid, and his situation is pushing to an edge he may not be able to get out of.  He needs out of that house, away from people who don't treat him as he deserves to be treated, it sounds like he is spiraling into serious depression, and needs away from all of the people who just don't see him.\n\nNTA for standing up for your brother, but Y T A for only just now seeing how everyone in his life treats him, and has always treated him.", "NTA ...And that was the right decision and hardly the most destructive option.", "^5 for standing up for your brother, I hope he goes and lives with you. NTA", "This is the mother who will stand over her son\u2019s grave and say \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d", "Your parents have created this disgusting situation, the bad v. Good child dynamic has fucked up a staggering large number of humans. Good on you for sticking up for your brother. He might need help or guidance to take the next step in life, not sure if you have the capacity to offer that, but I feel for him. Even if your parents don\u2019t say it out loud, they\u2019ve made it clear Jenny is the golden child.", "Did he get concussion? This could be a result of that, he may need a check up at the doctor. He could also need some therapy for guilt and PTSD.", "How hard does the golden child try to help her black sheep brother? Not much, I'm guessing. Golden children enjoy their privileges too much to see others suffering. \n\nI hope your brother gets away from your family asap. Damage done. They told him \"she matters, you don't.\" That will never be forgotten or forgiven. \n\nYour family sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "Make that hug from me, too. NTA", "Ditto tons of hugs.", "Yep. Mom is probably wanting him to go back to how he was before so she can carry on as she has been doing.", "Not saying something but expressing it in other ways is just as damaging, potentially more so.", "Honestly, it's probably just that because of repetition, you've got your sister's positive traits ingrained in your brain so they come to mind real fast, while you're not used to anyone speaking about Leo's good traits, so you'd actually have to sit and think about it.\n\nLike if he's always joking around, he's probably funny or witty or sensitive. He might also be polite, gentle, generally mild-mannered and patient considering he didn't lose his temper at his mum for letting these people in the house to talk bad about him all the time...", "Make up the spare room, tell him there's a bed there, tell him to come over for the weekend... Then when he's there, tell him he only has to go back to get more clothes, games, books, etc \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a lot easier to accept a \"long sleepover\" than it is to accept \"moving in with big sis/bro\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he's saying that he doesn't care, and that's the kind of environment that he's in... He does care. He just doesn't want to impose. So drag him over, show him its already all set up for him, tell him that he's got a few nights and then just... Don't make any expectations for him to go back to living with mum.", "How can you not be sure what to do?  Your own husband thinks it would be a good idea.\n\nSounds like your family- of-origin has some really dysfunctional relationship dynamics going on and perhaps you don't recognize it because you were raised in it.  Your husband has the ability to see if from the outside and can see how messed up it is. \n\nHelp your brother.  Tell him you want him to live with you for a while.  He needs to know that he is awesome on his own without all the unfair comparisons to your sister.  He is depressed and could use some counselling and a healthy home life.\n\nYou are NTA for kicking your mother's nasty friends out of the house. They (and your mom) had it coming.", "I wouldn\u2019t force him, but I\u2019d subtly give him the option. Make a room with a bed in it, and causally mention that he\u2019s welcome to stay at any time. It puts the decision more on him, and he won\u2019t feel like a burden since it\u2019s not *forever* in his mind. Give it a try, worse case he says no", "Where? I don\u2019t see anywhere OP said the parents apologized to Leo in the post, not seeing it in comments either.\n\nOP mentions mom went to apologize to her so-called friends, and that they \u201ckeep making an effort to cheer him up\u201d, but nothing about an actual apology to Leo.", "You did fine.  Someone had to stand up for your brother.", "He did get a mild concussion but all his physical injuries have healed pretty much. I do think he needs therapy as well and have offered to pay for him but he keeps laughing it off. He\u2019s 19 and I\u2019m not his parent so I can\u2019t really force him.", "She doesn\u2019t say anything to these women because they\u2019re intimidating and remember: she\u2019s only 17. But when I\u2019m not around she\u2019s the one that makes sure he isn\u2019t in his room all alone and she\u2019ll defend him over and over. When she realized that mom and dad initially blamed him for her getting hurt she got so angry at them and has reassured Leo so many times, more than anyone I\u2019d say. \n\nThey\u2019re close, even closer than I am to both. She may not understand what he\u2019s going through but neither do I.", "I agree, its repitition that drilled it into your brain, not entirely ops fault i say, but op, please help your brother, maybe a tramau therapist, nearly causing someones death or it appearing like that, can definately affect someones psyche", "He is extremely funny and he doesn\u2019t like getting angry which is probably why he\u2019s never said anything to anyone. He loves making people smile and he\u2019s great with kids because of it. He\u2019s also wonderful at sports and guitar. I know he\u2019s a good kid without a doubt but the fact I had to think about it is disappointing regardless of why.", "If it\u2019s at all possible for you to take him in please do.  And get him into therapy at once.  Don\u2019t know the rule here of mentioning it here, but I have suffered with depression and made 3 attempts.", "Okay, I feel this could work. I already have a couple ideas. I think this is how I\u2019ll introduce the whole thing. Thank you so much!!!", "I think growing up with these dynamics is confusing me. What I mean though is that I\u2019m not sure if Leo wants this or if I\u2019m supposed to do it anyways. I think I\u2019m just extremely anxious about making things worse. \n\nI\u2019ll talk to my husband about it some more and since we\u2019re going down this weekend, I\u2019ll talk to my brother as well. Thanks.", "That is troubling because your brother comes across as depressed. This is your parents' fault. They way they acted was utterly inexcusable.", "Yeah your sister is the golden child and bother is the scapegoat (please, he needs therapy before your parents keep pushing him down ) but OP your mother and father are a disgusting poor excuse of parents and should be ashamed of themselves for failing their son so horribly.\n\nNTA but I hope your bother can get out of there and cut contact with such a toxic people like your parents, I hope he finds a family that actually loves and support him, that he can heal from all their BS, he's young and deserves better.", "\"It's really hard to say if she feels this way genuinely\"  \n\n\nNow, I'm no parent... But I have been an older sibling and a teacher of children.   \n\n\nThe ONLY time I've ever sat back and let someone talk shit about another in my presence, is when I fully stood by everything that was being said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain. I'm no parent. And I expect a MUCH higher standard of care from a parent.", "Please update us when you can. We're all hoping for a happy solution!!", "This is what I was thinking. These awful people aren\u2019t just making nasty comments, they\u2019re endangering that boy\u2019s life. And his parents are doing nothing to help or protect him. OP\u2019s description of how he\u2019s coping with the accident is a huge concern. He needs help yesterday."]}
