It sounds like your brother may be depressed given that he was in bed at 4:00.  I'm not factoring in the idea that he wouldn't come out of his room because, frankly, with those women there, I wouldn't have come out, either.\n\nYour mom is TAH.  I get that they were upset when they initially made their comments to your brother.  Things do get said in the heat of the moment.  They shouldn't, but they do.  What I cannot understand is why she allows people to come into her home and make those comments about one of her kids and actually thinks they are her \"friends.\"  She should have been the one throwing them out, but since she wasn't, I'm glad you did.\n\nBoys often mature more slowly than girls.  Seriously, their brains don't develop as quickly.  It sounds like Leo just hasn't figured out who he is/what he wants out of life just yet.  Not everyone has to go to college.  Not everyone *should* go to college (and I say that as a former teacher).  The idea that anyone should write Leo off at this stage of his life is utterly unacceptable.  I do think you should keep an eye on Leo, though.  I think he may be silently suffering from depression and this accident and the comments he's gotten because of it are only piling on to make it worse.

She needs to decide if her \"friends\" are worth the risk to her sons mental health/life. \n\nI have unfortunately experienced the dread of a friend deciding to listen to people saying \"your family would be better off without you\" and taken the permanent solution to solve those peoples \"problem\".", "I'd bet money this is what is going on.\n\nI'm guessing either she grew up with these women, or they were the ones who \"took her in\" after a move.  In that sense, I feel bad for her.  It's rough when you have to start from square one again and find new friends.  Particularly if it's lifelong friends, you're never going to have that shared history with anyone again.\n\nHowever, she doesn't get to throw her child to the wolves because it will be rough on her.  They're terrible people, and not really her friends if they're saying such things.  She suffers from deep self-esteem issues if she doesn't believe she can do better than them.  Is there someone she would listen to (mother, aunt, sibling, respected cousin or life partner) who could really talk to her about why she needs them badly enough to destroy one of her children?  Is there anyone she can reach out to to hang with who's around her own age?  If not, are there any local groups that interest her, and might provide her with like-minded acquaintances?  People really do need contemporaries to talk to.  Partner and kids aren't enough.", "So what ?\n\nMy children matter more than than so called friends.   \n\nShe should have kicked them out herself.  \n\nWhat a lover of a mother.", "Yup, by silently standing by she\u2019s supporting THEM, not her son.", "They also started talking shit about her, right after they were tossed out.  They sound like a bunch of super mean 14 year olds.  We all need friends but these people sound like absolute garbage.  Is Mom\u2019s self esteem in the negatives???", "I would ask if your mum if she hates Leo, because that is what she is telling him.NAT", "The hero your brother needs. You\u2019re the hero your parents should have been,NAT"]}
