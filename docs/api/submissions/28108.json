Jenny is pretty, talented, smart, and kind. Leo\u2019s not a bad kid either but he\u2019s not in college and he jokes around a lot. \n\nAnyways, people (mom\u2019s friends) will often compare the two and they keep putting Leo down. He used to brush them off and acted like the comments don\u2019t bother him. \n\nA few weeks ago, Leo was picking Jenny up from school and they got into an accident. It wasn\u2019t Leo\u2019s fault at all but Jenny got more hurt. She\u2019s doing better now while Leo seems to be falling down a hole of self hatred. The accident brought out the worst in our parents and before we knew all the details they were all like \u201cwhy couldn\u2019t you be more careful\u201d or \u201cyou know how precious she is.\u201d They were extremely worried about him as well  but he hasn\u2019t been the same since they said that to him. \n\nMom and dad feel guilty now that it isn\u2019t as tense anymore and keep making an effort to cheer him up but he isn\u2019t giving anything back. \n\nI would be more sympathetic towards them but mom\u2019s still friends with the people who were/are saying terrible things about him. I\u2019m not going to share the worst of it but they have implied that Jenny should\u2019ve been the one who came out \u201cfine\u201d. My mom tells them off but the fact that she\u2019s still willingly inviting them around Jenny and Leo pisses me off. \n\nIt was my birthday last week so I was visiting. For some reason, all my mom\u2019s friends were there. Jenny was present and happy. But my brother refused to leave his room and was in bed when I checked on him at around 4pm. \n\nAfter dinner I made a plate for my brother and was going to go sit with him for a little while but right as I was leaving mom\u2019s friends were like \u201cI can\u2019t believe that kid, Jenny went through so much yet here she is helping out while he\u2019s getting dinner served directly to him. He\u2019s really going to be a loser for the rest of his life,\u201d and they just wouldn\u2019t stop talking about him like he was a waste of space or a mistake.\n\nI told them to get out. They were surprised and my mom told me to calm down but I didn\u2019t stop yelling at these women till all of them left. Some of them were still eating and I didn\u2019t let them them collect their things either. My mom was extremely upset and left to go give them their things and apologize but apparently they\u2019re not talking to her anymore. \n\nThey\u2019re also making mean comments about her but I don\u2019t care. She wants me to apologize but I refused and told her it wasn\u2019t my problem. I do feel bad though because mom\u2019s been crying and besides I could\u2019ve gone about the whole thing in another less destructive way. So AITA? I was pretty disrespectful.\n\nSorry for the choppiness, the word count is kicking my ass.", "created_utc": 1696304319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yhj67/aita_for_kicking_my_moms_friends_out_of_her/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm glad he has someone like you to care about him. I wish you luck and give him a hug from the random internet humans who stand by him.", "NTA.\n\nI would ask if your mum if she hates Leo, because that is what she is telling him, by letting people that treat him this way into his house, to continue spewing hatred towards him to his whole family and in front of her.\n\nHe likely thinks she and Dad feel the same way as her friends, because this is the company she is choosing to keep: people that literally hate him and can't go five minutes without commenting on how inferior he is to his younger sister.", "NTA, you were defending your brother, who is struggling with self-hatred, and your mom has the audacity to let those kinds of people be around her children, all of whom are already dealing with trauma. Mom needs better friends.", "NTA \n\nWow. Poor Leo. I worry this has been his whole upbringing by his parents by being demeaned and compared to his sister. That is very toxic behavior and I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re parents. Parents that also divulged their disfavor to other people about their son like that. You did nothing wrong. Thankfully he has you in his corner to defend him. Your parents and they\u2019re friends are TAs and bullies.", "NTA. You\u2019re the hero your brother needs. You\u2019re the hero your parents should have been.", "NTA\n\nIf anybody said that about my sibling i would go ballistic, ESPECIALLY since he was already beating himself down about the whole incident.\n\nThem implying that Jenny was the one to come out fine really shows how disgusting they are and shame on your mother for allowing them to be there knowing how badly they regard your brother.", "NTA, they were kicking your brother while he's down during a celebration for your birthday. If they are now talking bad about your mother, it sounds like you did her a huge favor as well.", "NTA - could you have communicated better? Yes. Maybe you were even kinda AH-ish. But your mom's friends were such humongous AHs that your AH is insignificant in comparison. Your mom too, she needs to stop treating her kids like this and get better friends.", "NTA\n\nyour parents and these so called friends have been awful to your brother. \n\nWell done, this situation did not require diplomacy, it needed what you gave it.", "All I can say is NTA. Props to you for being the mother and putting your brothers feelings over your moms care of being in the good graces of such asshole friends. Your brother must respect you so much right now. Your mom is not putting her kids first at the moment, she needs some therapy or something", "NTA\n\nTell your mom you'll consider apologizing to them when they all make personal, sincere apologies to your brother.  If she doesn't like having shit talked about her by these hens, then maybe now she has a little bit of an idea how your brother feels.", "Yeah, YTA. It isn\u2019t your house, it is your mom\u2019s house. If she so desires, she can kick her \u201cfriends\u201d out, it isn\u2019t your place-again, because 1)not your house and 2)you\u2019re the child, not the parent.  You absolutely owe your mom an apology, you said yourself you realize you were being disrespectful.  \n\n\nis your mom not very nice for allowing her supposed \u201cfriends\u201d to treat her children that way? Absolutely. But it\u2019s still not your place to say or do anything.", "Another hours-old account. \n \nYTA and so is your mom. But, no-one should be dissing kids in front of their parents. It\u2019s not your job to handle it in your parents home. Your parents house. Your parents rules. You don\u2019t get to decide who stays and goes.\n\nIf there\u2019s a next time, simply say \u201cdon\u2019t discus my siblings this way in their own home\u201d, firmly.

It sounds like your brother may be depressed given that he was in bed at 4:00.  I'm not factoring in the idea that he wouldn't come out of his room because, frankly, with those women there, I wouldn't have come out, either.\n\nYour mom is TAH.  I get that they were upset when they initially made their comments to your brother.  Things do get said in the heat of the moment.  They shouldn't, but they do.  What I cannot understand is why she allows people to come into her home and make those comments about one of her kids and actually thinks they are her \"friends.\"  She should have been the one throwing them out, but since she wasn't, I'm glad you did.\n\nBoys often mature more slowly than girls.  Seriously, their brains don't develop as quickly.  It sounds like Leo just hasn't figured out who he is/what he wants out of life just yet.  Not everyone has to go to college.  Not everyone *should* go to college (and I say that as a former teacher).  The idea that anyone should write Leo off at this stage of his life is utterly unacceptable.  I do think you should keep an eye on Leo, though.  I think he may be silently suffering from depression and this accident and the comments he's gotten because of it are only piling on to make it worse.  He really should see a doctor to make sure he's going to be okay.", "NTA. I hope all of you can get away from your toxic parents soon", "NTA. Good job.", "NTA at all.\nSometimes you have to be the only one who will make a fuss.\nGood for you!", "You realise your mam has probably been talking to her friends like this for years and that's why they have that opinion on you brother being a loser", "Jenny tries as well, she\u2019s genuinely an angel. She gets mad at our parents too and when I\u2019m not around she makes sure Leo isn\u2019t alone for too long. He has some amazing friends too. \n\nBut thank you so much, I\u2019m going to give him the tightest hug the next time I see him.", "I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m defending my parents for how they\u2019re treating my brother because even I know for a fact that they\u2019re wrong but they really don\u2019t compare the two and never have. What they said to him after the accident was inexcusable and incredibly shocking but it was the first time they had ever said anything like that. I don\u2019t know why my mom wants to be their friend so badly and why my dad doesn\u2019t discourage her but I\u2019d like to believe it isnt because they agree with them.", "Yes, I made a throwaway. Husband encouraged me to post because I couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\nAnyways, I understand. I know there were better ways to deal with this but my mind gets so angry just thinking about those women that I\u2019m unable to think about anything else other than yelling at them which isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing I suppose.", "If they didn\u2019t agree with the friends they\u2019d tell them to stop.  \nYour parents are AHs", "And you edited after I commented. Not good form!", "I think it\u2019s time you confront your mother on why she continues to allow these \u201cfriends\u201d of hers to tear down her child instead of protecting him", "The only thing I changed was the very last line but that was before anyone commented\u2026 I don\u2019t think I follow LOL"]}
