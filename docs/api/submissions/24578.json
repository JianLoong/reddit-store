It was within your rights to say no. And I'm sorry your husband thinks you need to apologize here and that he is encouraging her dysfunction.", "NTA\n\nCaring for children is hard, even when they're yours and you love them. Caring for other people's children is even harder, and caring for family member's children can cause even more problems due to expectations and differences in methods. \n\nYou didn't owe her an explanation but you gave her a reasonable one. \n\nShe's being childish and ridiculous. And your husband needs to understand that.", "NTA.\n\nShe was just trying to get a freebie from you and you said no, so she got all butt hurt because she thinks she is entitled.\n\nDo not apologize.", "This is absolutely absurd. Unless she had an eighteen-month-long pregnancy, she and her husband became pregnant *during* the pandemic and after most childcare had closed;  and therefore *knew* that they'd need to make arrangements. \"Pawning my kid off on my husband's sister\" isn't a plan. You aren't a nanny just because you're female and have kids. It is deeply unreasonable of your husband to prompt you to apologize for not caring for someone else's infant close to 40% of the time. What are you, her husband? NTA.", "NTA she's asking for what I'm currently paying $300 a week for. That's a huge ask.", "NTA, but it feels like you already knew that. There\u2019s no context for why SIL thinks she\u2019s in the right here. Is there anything you\u2019re leaving out?", "NTA. I don't see why she is so mad she got her freebie from someone else, Don't apologize it will just open you up to her next request.", "Fuck your SIL. \n\nNta", "NTA. We're all entitled to a break for the sake our mental health. If it was too much for you to take on your SIL's newborn at that time , your decision should be respected by your SIL and IL's, so should it be by your Husband.\n\nThey are the ones who should be more understanding and owe you the apology.", "NTA and also correct, no need to acknowledge your SIL\u2019s passive aggressive bs.  If she\u2019s got a problem with you, she should be direct about it.  If your husband has a problem with her, he should address it with her.  (And if her problem is your unwillingness to be free daycare for her, she needs to reset her expectations.  You\u2019re already raising three of your own.)", "NTA \n\nAppease the bullies because we're all afraid of them and just want some peace and quiet!\n\nNope. You're all good OP!", "NTA\n\nShe has **no** right to boss you around or force to to care for *her* kids. That's her problem. It wasn't like she was paying you either. Her refusing to talk to you and not letting your husband see his niece is just petty behavior, especially since she got her free child care in the end.

If I were you then I really wouldn't care if I don't see her. It also sounds like she's toxic to your brother by preventing him from seeing your kids. Your SIL is toxic AF and I'd be sure to point that out any chance I have.  \n\n\nMy wife and I had twins and daycare was more than our mortgage. I never once thought of taking advantage of a family member for free care. My children - my problem. The audacity of some people blows me away.", "NTA", "NTA. She is asking for your free labor and with holding her relationship with her brother. She\u2019s definitely TA.", "NTA what exactly does your husband think you should apologise for? It's not your duty to provide your SiL with childcare. You never said you would. I don't see that you have done anything wrong.", "NTA, your SIL is not entitled to your time, and you don't owe her anything.", "NTA. Her children - her responsibility. Or you could give her the price for being a nanny. \nBut you have bigger problems with your husband. Apparently he sees nothing wrong with people trying to steal your time. Maybe counselling could help?", "NTA\n\nShe asked, you declined.  That should have been the end of the story.  You don't owe her childcare.  She found someone else to do her free babysitting. Not sure why she's butthurt but you surely don't owe her an apology.  Your husband needs to back off.  What exactly is the apology supposed to be for?  Living your own life without his sister's express approval?

She found another relative who lacked your spine, but she's still living in a state of rage.\n\nYour husband is totally wrong. You don't owe this b an apology. If your in-laws don't like having a free soul in the family, they can stew in their juices over a hot flame.", "NTA. \n\nNo.  It's both an acceptable answer and a full sentence.", "NTA.  It was okay for your SIL to ask, but not okay for her to act as she did at your refusal. And your husband should be on YOUR side. He wasn't the one who was expected to provide free daycare, was he? No. There's no reason for you to apologize. You did nothing wrong. SIL did and is still doing wrong.\n\n\nHave hubby look at the comments here.", "NTA.  Your SIL needs to grow up, accept you are fully entitled to say no, and move on.  You owe no apology but she does for her juvenile behaviour. She is responsible for her child\u2019s needs and you are under no obligation to do anything for her.  Your husband should be backing you up on this.", "NTA she sure is.", "NTA", "NTA ....actually you win hero for the day award..tell dear husband to, well you know", "INFO\n\nAre you sure this is everything OP?
