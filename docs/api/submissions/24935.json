My reason for this was not just the cheating. But the fact I found out about it way earlier and mom told me that if I told anyone else, especially dad, everyone would hate me and that included dad and my siblings.

My siblings learned about the reason almost immediately and they decided that they wouldn't hate mom for the affair, which I get.

Eventually they started complaining that I was punishing them as well as mom because they couldn't have their whole family together.\n\nThey pushed extra hard when mom had more kids with the affair partner who is now her husband.

If you think your mom could agree to steer clear of you and your siblings could stop themselves from trying to make you interact, this could be an option. No one in our family expects grandma to talk to grandpa, but we also don\u2019t want to exclude either of them in order to include the other. \n\nIf your siblings and mother couldn\u2019t help themselves from trying to force a reconciliation at one of these events, I guess that would be your answer on whether to attend any at all.

I think the siblings have good intentions but ultimately they can't force you into doing something you're uncomfortable with", "more than the affair, she literally put the weight of it on her 11 yo child. that is manipulative and abusive.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "One minor correction; OP owes herself forgiveness, and sometimes, just sometimes, forgiving the people who have wronged one, without forgetting, or letting them hurt you any more, can also benefit oneself.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I really hope OP is close to her dad who seems like the only member of their original family to not be on this \"NEW FAAMILY\" bullshit.", "You need therapy\u2026..either that or a cat, you need to forgive, not forget\u2026..or actually tell your mom 1on1 what she put you through\u2026\u2026you\u2019re probably a very miserable person in real life because you can\u2019t let go and are willing to ostracize the family\u2026..you\u2019re not the victim anymore", "NTA, but you really shouldn't ignore this part:\n\n>and that I will lose them if I take myself out of every milestone she's at. \n\nThey will continue to invite their mother to all kinds of events like their birthdays, weddings, birthdays of their future children, etc. I don't know how much you still like your siblings, but if you want to have a good connection with them in the future, you might have to find a way to coexist with your mother for a few hours in the same room, like completely ignoring her while she is close. \n\nThough of course you can decide against it and rather go low to no contact with your siblings.\n\nYou can't have both, a good connection with your siblings and no contact with your mother at the same time.", "NTA. They\u2019re perfectly entitled to feel disappointed you can\u2019t let it go, but you can\u2019t let it go and understandably so!", "NTA \n\nDon't back down. You have good reasons to still feel aggrieved: your mother basically abused you as a child. Tell your siblings they are continuing the abuse by harassing you.", "NTA\n\nThe party isn't actually important.  Your mental health is what should be the most important thing to you.  If that results in you removing yourself from aspects of their life, or not attending this party, or whatever that is, that's reasonable.\n\nI didn't read anything in this story about your mother's heartfelt breakdown and apology for manipulating her child.", "Nta. She gaslit you. She scared you. She mentally tortured you. Your own mother.", ">because this party is important.\n\nIt's really not that important though. They can feel disappointed that you're not reconciling, but they should respect your decision. They're treating their feeling of disappointment as a sign that you are doing something wrong. They can have a negative emotional experience and still respect your decision and they should understand they didn't live your life, they didn't have your experiences, only YOU did. NTA", "NTA, your siblings are selfish AHs that learned well from your mother.  You are better off with distance from them.", "NTA.  Nobody can tell you how your feel.  If you don't feel like ever talking to your cheating, bullying Mom ever again.   That's how you feel.  She apparently taught all of them how to bully too.", "NTA but hell i would go every time and say i hated her if she ever tried to talk to me and would be like im not your sister if the new kods tried to talk to me.", "YTA, you should absolutely attend a family party", "NTA. I'm so sorry OP. I  have family like this and it's so wearing. They should be angry at your mother for causing this situation in the first place and putting such a burden on a child.", "NTA  What your mother did was horrible and she hasn't offered a sincere apology either.  Why should you have to see someone you don't want to?  None of your siblings seem to want to understand how horrible this was for you and they don't seem to care either.  You don't have to put aside hurt feelings or anything else.  Talk with your dad, but I think in the end, you shouldn't have to go unless you want to.", "NTA.  You know, every time I see one of these in which the kids hate the parents who had affairs (as much as I deeply hate cheating) I think, that's not necessarily right.  Sometimes things are much more complicated than what the kids see or hear. \n\nHowever, what your mother said to you was so deeply wrong.  She blackmailed her own child to hide her dirty secret.  You were her oldest (right?)  and what she did was hurtful and abusive.  A good parent does not manipulate their child like that.\n\nA good person does not force a child to lie through fear. \n\nYou owe this woman nothing.", "NTA your own mother blackmailed you into not telling about the affair, obviously she\u2019s a piece of excrement", "NTA your siblings are discounting the trauma your mother put you through and STILL puts you through as a result of your siblings current behavior. I'm sorry that your siblings would rather pretend happy then support you. But they have shown you how much you matter to them, so believe them.", "Emotional abuse is just as bad as physical abuse except it was for three years constant and then from the secret being out until now.  Would you really want to be in the same room as someone who did that to you?  What about if they beat or SA'd you?  The lack of empathy is ridiculous.", "The kids will still have a grandpa, and the dads parents. Just not op\u2019s mom. And as for the siblings kids, that all depends if the siblings can accept the fact that their mom is dead to op.", "Speaking of which has she ever fucking apologized for this? \n\nAnd I mean a real, true apology. Not just saying sorry but admitting that she was wrong. That OP was just a child and putting that pressure and responsiblity and shame on them rather than take ownership of her actions was the cruelest thing she could've done and that she'll regret it til the day she dies? \n\nBecause if that has not happened then there's no fucking point in forgiving her because she must not really care either way.", "F that. Because they want a picture like they are one big happy family? Your mother is a horrible human being and threatened you, abused you mentally and emotionally and tore apart your family. Her the rest of them can screw off. Your age has nothing to do with it. The trauma she caused for three years I\u2019m sure still impacts you. Has she ever tried to apologize or even take responsibility for it? \n\nThey are adults so you need to let them know. I will never see or speak to her and if you cannot try and understand or at least not push the issue, then I don\u2019t need this in my life. I have never asked you to hate her or not have her in your life (even though you should) but you do not get to ask that of me either. \n\nAlso I bet your mom is pushing it to them too so she can stop feeling guilty over her manipulation and stop feeling like a horrible wh0r3 of a mother.", "What has your mom done to show she even deserves forgiveness?", "You're right about those things. But when you are growing up with those expectation, you don't think to question it. I didn't figure out I could live my life for me until I was in my late 20s.", "Maybe I'm just an AH but somethings can not be forgiven with an apology otherwise everyone could just do whatever they wanted and apologize later.  She knew what she was doing was wrong when she was cheating and knew what she was doing was wrong when she made OP lie for her own selfishness."]}
