In the last 7ish years our relationship broke down a bit after our mom's affair was revealed publicly and I chose to no longer have anything to do with her. My reason for this was not just the cheating. But the fact I found out about it way earlier and mom told me that if I told anyone else, especially dad, everyone would hate me and that included dad and my siblings. That I would single handedly be responsible for destroying our family. I was 12 when I found out about the affair and I believed my mom. It scared the shit out of me that everyone would hate my guts. It took 3 or so years for me to realize I had to tell my dad even if everyone hated me.\n\nSo I told dad and life as we knew it did change. My dad kicked my mom out of the house and she moved in with her affair partner. My siblings learned about the reason almost immediately and they decided that they wouldn't hate mom for the affair, which I get. They didn't understand my hatred for her even when I told them what had happened. But they let it go for a couple of years. Eventually they started complaining that I was punishing them as well as mom because they couldn't have their whole family together.\n\nThey pushed extra hard when mom had more kids with the affair partner who is now her husband. They were so excited for more siblings and I told them it was great they had new siblings but it was nothing to do with me.\n\nMy siblings now want to have a big family party with both our maternal and paternal sides present and for everyone to get along. They told me I can sacrifice my comfort for a few minutes for them. I told them I would not do that to myself again. That what mom put me through when I was just a gullible kid was cruel and manipulative and I would not put myself through that for them or anyone. They threw it in my face that dad made peace with mom already. I said he did that for their sakes and because they pressed the issue. They said it was an asshole thing to expect them to pick between us and that I will lose them if I take myself out of every milestone she's at. I asked them if I would rather I tell her every single time I see her that I hate her and I laughed when I heard she and her affair partner gave each other STDs, which is a thing that happened. \n\nThey said I am the oldest and should put aside whatever hurt feelings I have for them, for my family, because this party is important.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692360582, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uitb3/aita_for_telling_my_siblings_i_wont_be_attending/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has she ever publicly taken responsibility for breaking up the family, instead of forcing you to be the scapegoat?\n\nPlease don't let yourself feel guilty if you choose to skip their event. I suspect that if you go, your mother may interpret it as your giving her a free pass over her atrocious behavior toward you.", "NTA Your mom is an awful human.  You have no obligation to be around her.  Tel you siblings to get over it.", "NTA either way but did she ever even acknowledge and apologise? I'm guessing not if she's that manipulative!\n\n so I'd tell your siblings that it's not on you to take any steps to reconciliation when she can't even acknowledge the trauma she caused you.\n\nIf you're up for being petty and willing to be disingenuous and play along for a while you could agree to go to the family reunion but only if your mum publically admits at the event to what she did, how she treated you and apologise.\n\nOutcome 1: she refuses and now your siblings can't come at you because you gave the solution and she's the one not making it work.\n\nOutcome 2: she does agree and you get to see her humiliate herself and admit what she did in front of everyone. Then you can go back to no contact.\n\nBUT this is just me being petty and devious", "I don't understand why being in the same location as your mother means \"doing that to yourself again.\" You don't have to talk to her? NTA bc you are not required to attend a party but it feels like you are cutting off your nose to spite your face here", "NTA\nGood on you for recognizing and protecting the hurt and trauma you still feel from your mom's selfish and cruel demands that you hide her infidelity in a stage of adolescence that is fraught with vulnerability and emotional confusion. You were parentified (forced to be your mother's confidante) and abused in a way your siblings weren't. Your experience, feelings, and boundaries to prevent increasing that trauma are valid and justified.\n\nSadly, your siblings show no empathy for the effects of that traumatic parentification on you. People who devalue and dismiss your needs and boundaries like this are just the people with whom you need to hold those boundaries. You do not need anyone else's approval or \"understanding\" for your boundaries to be valid. You are wise to refuse to put yourself in situations that will hurt you.", "Nta for not wanting to reconcile with your mother but what is the event that they\u2019re inviting both sides of the family to? If you\u2019re skipping siblings weddings and important milestones because you want to punish your mother, you\u2019re only hurting yourself and your siblings.\n\nI have divorced grandparents who hate each other but they come to important family milestones like graduations and weddings and just don\u2019t talk to each other. If you think your mom could agree to steer clear of you and your siblings could stop themselves from trying to make you interact, this could be an option. No one in our family expects grandma to talk to grandpa, but we also don\u2019t want to exclude either of them in order to include the other. \n\nIf your siblings and mother couldn\u2019t help themselves from trying to force a reconciliation at one of these events, I guess that would be your answer on whether to attend any at all. But you shouldn\u2019t have to be forced to forgive or interact with her, and at some point your siblings need to respect that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
