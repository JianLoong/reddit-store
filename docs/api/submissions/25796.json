My husband\u2019s previous relationship ended badly, to say the least. He was going through a lot when his ex left him. His parents and grandmother were in a drunk driver accident and both his parents were temporarily disabled. My husband had to take over their care and bills, and while this was happening his was happening his ex basically robbed him and left. Not going into too many details, but my mother and MIL have known each other since high school, and my family was supporting him and his siblings throughout all of this. so my husband is very protective of my family, especially my mother. If I argue with my mom, 8/10 he\u2019s on her side.\n\nNow the kids have been with us since they were 4 and 1, and they\u2019ve never been excluded from anything my family does. My family is huge and very close, we often have multiple birthdays in the same week or on the same day. What we often do is have all the birthday parties on the same day and just make it one big party. My stepdaughter, sister\u2019s daughter, and 3 other kids in our family have their birthday on the same day or week, so we\u2019ve always had them all celebrate on the same day since her second birthday.\n\nNow my husband\u2019s ex has not been at any birthday party since she left. She is somewhat involved, but not really, it depends on her. I am in contact with her because my husband hates her, if she sends him an email his entire day is ruined.I was updating her on how the kids are doing, My (step)daughter\u2019s birth is March 11 and I mentioned the big birthday party we\u2019re planning. She then called upset and expressed that she for once wanted to do the birthday parties. I told her she was welcome at our party or could do her own. She said no, she wanted to organize just one party for her and for us not to do a birthday party since it would overshadow hers because our birthday parties are a bit extravagant. I told her I would discuss this with my husband.\n\nI already knew my husband would not approve of this, so I decided to ask what my (step)daughter wanted. She told me she would like to have her birthday party with us. I of course told her that was okay and I would tell her mom that. She didn\u2019t seem upset when I asked her about it.She spent the weekend at my parents home and my mom scolded me for asking her and told me she was very upset. She said to my mother that she feels like I\u2019ll send her away and that I don\u2019t want them anymore.\n\nI of course tried to explain why I asked, but my mother was not having it. She said I shouldn\u2019t have asked in the first place. My husband of course is on my mother\u2019s side. Everyone is upset, my husband, parents siblings, even my (step)son.I honestly feel like they\u2019re overreacting, because they feel a certain way about the ex.I feel like the question wasn\u2019t unreasonable and they should be more reasonable, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693323314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164lpso/aita_for_asking_my_stepdaughter_if_she_wants_to/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that your husband hates her doesn't mean you should be bending over backwards to facilitate any contact.   It appears that your stepdaughter sees you as advocating for her mother rather than for her, that's something you should work on.", "Kids always process things differently, so maybe to your step daughter the question made he think that her Birthday wouldn't be acknowledged at all with her Grandparents? \n\nEven if she wanted a Birthday Party with her Bio Mom, im sure she also wanted the style of party she always has. \n\nIf Bio Mom wants to be involved on \"her terms\" then she needs to earn the right to throw Birthday Parties and until she is asked shouldn't feel like she gets the right. \n\nNTA, but both parties should have honestly been an option.", ">Everyone is upset, my husband, parents siblings, even my (step)son\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and told me she was very upset.\n\nDid you have a discussion with our step-daughter after all of this? Because it seem like you saw directly that everybody was upset, but the reaction of your step-daughter was communicated to you by your mother.\n\nShe is 14yo she can talk about how she feel with you. Just talk with her to know where she stand, as long as you show to her that you want her to be honest with you it should be fine. All you wanted was for her to made the decision she was the most comfortable with.\n\nHere how I see the situation. You genuinely wanted to ask her what she prefer, which is good, children are people too and they should be allowed to voice their opinion. But your step-daughter probably have some level of abandonment issues, after all her mother abandoned her (mostly).\n\nSo even if your action were good, the way your step-daughter made her fear that you wanted to push her away toward her mother. NAH is an asshole here and this should be resolve with a discussion one on one between you are step-daughter. As long as you communicate that all you wanted was for her to have agency in the decision and that you will always be there for her, it should all be good.\n\nAs for everybody else, they are just emotionally reacting to step-daughter being hurt. She is hurt, it's a sensitive subject and you are the cause, that's all that matter in the moment and so they lashed out at you. Once the situation between you and step-daughter will be resolve, they won't be as emotional and they might see the situation more clearly. \n\nAt the end of the day NTA, we never know what kind of words will sometime hurt the people we love, we can only do our best and try to find issues when there is misunderstanding.", "NTA", "YTA. Should have discussed this with your husband and mutually decided how to approach it.", "ESH.  Clearly the bio mom sucks for asking her daughter to not be apart of the family birthday party so that her party would be the only one.  You suck because taking away a birthday party for your daughter should never have been an option.  Asking a kid to voluntary give something up that they want for the sake of an adult is putting them in a bad place.  Any implications that they should give up their own happiness for the happiness of an adult is a bad place to put a kid in.  Your husband sucks because when you marry someone they should be your priority, not their mother.  His dedication to your family puts you in a very bad place.\n\nI get that you are trying to help bio mom, but the kid needs to come first, and clearly bio mom isn't putting the kids first so you need to think extra hard about making sure bio mom isn't doing anything that will harm or upset the kids.\n\nOh - your husband also sucks for putting all the mental and emotional labor of dealing with his kids mother on you.  He is a full adult who decided to marry and have children with this woman - it is his responsibility to sort out issues with her.  Throwing a big fit and making everyone miserable for the rest of the day (I'm reading between the lines here) just because you have to deal with your own responsibilities is childish and bratty.  Do you do all if the rest of the mental and emotional labor in the house?", "NTA. At age 11  your stepdaughter should have some autonomy.

It reads like the Bio Mom is playing you like a fiddle.", "YTA. Ordinarily I would say that it\u2019s very good to ask children what they want, but when it comes to the mother who abandoned her child, the adults should discuss first. In a situation where the potential fallout will be shared, the decision making should be shared. \n\nAlso. People don\u2019t like the bio mom because she is a piece of work. It\u2019s absolutely none of her business what kind of her party is being thrown for her child otherwise and I\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know this.

The daughter is 11 and making her feel like it has to be one or the other is unfair. She doesn\u2019t want to disappoint anyone. You are the adult and you should have simply put your foot down and told the ex wife you would not be changing plans. \n\nHowever, if your husband doesn\u2019t want to man up and deal with his ex than he needs to respect your decisions.

No reason the mom can't throw a party or do something special with daughter.", "NTA. \n\nIt depends of course on how you said it, but I feel like asking your step-daughter about the party is the best decision. This way the Ex then also cannot manipulate her into \"oh, I wanted to throw you a party but OP did not allow it\".\n\nIf your husband is so unhappy with it, he should take over the communication with his Ex, as is actually his job.", "This exactly.", "They are already planning in AUGUST for a party in MARCH. LOL unless it's a wedding, I can't imagine bio-mom being able to throw anything close LOL", "she's 11, the son is 14, just a small correction", "Can you sit with your daughter and explain? Just skip all the middle-people and go to her. \n\nYou can also use it as a learning moment - that she can vent to her grandma, but if it\u2019s something like this, you are the best person to explain and resolve it so she is happy. Because that\u2019s what matters to you and you won\u2019t be mad", "I guess she was given the option to throw her own party and she didn\u2019t like that so that is on bio. She can do whatever she wants. She is just making problems. \n\nAs far as op sd is ok having a shared birthday that is great. Family birthdays are fun. They might visit the shared birthday when she is older in case she wants a more personal one. Sounds like stepmom is doing a good job", "[removed]"]}
