My husband\u2019s previous relationship ended badly, to say the least. He was going through a lot when his ex left him. His parents and grandmother were in a drunk driver accident and both his parents were temporarily disabled. My husband had to take over their care and bills, and while this was happening his was happening his ex basically robbed him and left. Not going into too many details, but my mother and MIL have known each other since high school, and my family was supporting him and his siblings throughout all of this. so my husband is very protective of my family, especially my mother. If I argue with my mom, 8/10 he\u2019s on her side.\n\nNow the kids have been with us since they were 4 and 1, and they\u2019ve never been excluded from anything my family does. My family is huge and very close, we often have multiple birthdays in the same week or on the same day. What we often do is have all the birthday parties on the same day and just make it one big party. My stepdaughter, sister\u2019s daughter, and 3 other kids in our family have their birthday on the same day or week, so we\u2019ve always had them all celebrate on the same day since her second birthday.\n\nNow my husband\u2019s ex has not been at any birthday party since she left. She is somewhat involved, but not really, it depends on her. I am in contact with her because my husband hates her, if she sends him an email his entire day is ruined.I was updating her on how the kids are doing, My (step)daughter\u2019s birth is March 11 and I mentioned the big birthday party we\u2019re planning. She then called upset and expressed that she for once wanted to do the birthday parties. I told her she was welcome at our party or could do her own. She said no, she wanted to organize just one party for her and for us not to do a birthday party since it would overshadow hers because our birthday parties are a bit extravagant. I told her I would discuss this with my husband.\n\nI already knew my husband would not approve of this, so I decided to ask what my (step)daughter wanted. She told me she would like to have her birthday party with us. I of course told her that was okay and I would tell her mom that. She didn\u2019t seem upset when I asked her about it.She spent the weekend at my parents home and my mom scolded me for asking her and told me she was very upset. She said to my mother that she feels like I\u2019ll send her away and that I don\u2019t want them anymore.\n\nI of course tried to explain why I asked, but my mother was not having it. She said I shouldn\u2019t have asked in the first place. My husband of course is on my mother\u2019s side. Everyone is upset, my husband, parents siblings, even my (step)son.I honestly feel like they\u2019re overreacting, because they feel a certain way about the ex.I feel like the question wasn\u2019t unreasonable and they should be more reasonable, AITA?", "created_utc": 1693323314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164lpso/aita_for_asking_my_stepdaughter_if_she_wants_to/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stepdaughter says the regular party you throw. \n\n\nSometimes later Stepdaughter is with Grandma and told Grandma that you asked and someone that got turned around into Her(sd) saying you were trying go send her away to her bio mom's? \n\n\nSomeone lied or turned an innocent question into something bad. \n\nIf she doesn't have a relationship with her bio mom then she doesn't have a say in the birthday parties. And shouldn't have asked in the first place. \n\nBut if the family is bitter then they could have made the lil girl feel bad when she possibly asked their opinion on the matter.", "nta. the mom def is. but you shouldn't have asked the birthday girl. the hardly involved parent has no right to insert her will and presence whenever she wants in the kids' lives. it will just mess with the kids' hearts and feelings. why should your sd need to lose a birthday celebration just because bio mom suddenly wants to play happy family? she can have two. and if bio mom feels inferior, then she is really not a mom. spending time with a child is more important than the money you throw at the kid.\n\n you're more a mom to the kids than their bio mom is.", "I just feel like all of this could have been resolved had you told bio mom that she is welcome to have her a party but that you will continue your tradition with her as you always have. And if bio mom gave push back you tell that she's an asshole who left her kids as toddlers, isn't involved, and doesn't have custody, and will therefore not dictate how you and your family do things.", "\u201cIf I argue with my mom he\u2019s 8/10 on her side\u201d\n\nHUSBAND. ISSUE. \n\nNTA", "**NTA**  Depending on exactly how you approached it, there shouldn't really a problem with talking to your stepdaughter about her mother's request.  How though, have you followed up about the insecurity that it exposed and why didn't the child feel comfortable telling you how she felt?\n\nWhy have you been so engaged with her mother in the first place?  The fact that your husband hates her doesn't mean you should be bending over backwards to facilitate any contact.   It appears that your stepdaughter sees you as advocating for her mother rather than for her, that's something you should work on.", "Kids always process things differently, so maybe to your step daughter the question made he think that her Birthday wouldn't be acknowledged at all with her Grandparents? \n\nEven if she wanted a Birthday Party with her Bio Mom, im sure she also wanted the style of party she always has. \n\nIf Bio Mom wants to be involved on \"her terms\" then she needs to earn the right to throw Birthday Parties and until she is asked shouldn't feel like she gets the right. \n\nNTA, but both parties should have honestly been an option.", ">Everyone is upset, my husband, parents siblings, even my (step)son\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and told me she was very upset.\n\nDid you have a discussion with our step-daughter after all of this? Because it seem like you saw directly that everybody was upset, but the reaction of your step-daughter was communicated to you by your mother.\n\nShe is 14yo she can talk about how she feel with you. Just talk with her to know where she stand, as long as you show to her that you want her to be honest with you it should be fine. All you wanted was for her to made the decision she was the most comfortable with.\n\nHere how I see the situation. You genuinely wanted to ask her what she prefer, which is good, children are people too and they should be allowed to voice their opinion. But your step-daughter probably have some level of abandonment issues, after all her mother abandoned her (mostly).\n\nSo even if your action were good, the way your step-daughter made her fear that you wanted to push her away toward her mother. NAH is an asshole here and this should be resolve with a discussion one on one between you are step-daughter. As long as you communicate that all you wanted was for her to have agency in the decision and that you will always be there for her, it should all be good.\n\nAs for everybody else, they are just emotionally reacting to step-daughter being hurt. She is hurt, it's a sensitive subject and you are the cause, that's all that matter in the moment and so they lashed out at you. Once the situation between you and step-daughter will be resolve, they won't be as emotional and they might see the situation more clearly. \n\nAt the end of the day NTA, we never know what kind of words will sometime hurt the people we love, we can only do our best and try to find issues when there is misunderstanding.", "NTA", "YTA. Should have discussed this with your husband and mutually decided how to approach it.", "ESH.  Clearly the bio mom sucks for asking her daughter to not be apart of the family birthday party so that her party would be the only one.  You suck because taking away a birthday party for your daughter should never have been an option.  Asking a kid to voluntary give something up that they want for the sake of an adult is putting them in a bad place.  Any implications that they should give up their own happiness for the happiness of an adult is a bad place to put a kid in.  Your husband sucks because when you marry someone they should be your priority, not their mother.  His dedication to your family puts you in a very bad place.\n\nI get that you are trying to help bio mom, but the kid needs to come first, and clearly bio mom isn't putting the kids first so you need to think extra hard about making sure bio mom isn't doing anything that will harm or upset the kids.\n\nOh - your husband also sucks for putting all the mental and emotional labor of dealing with his kids mother on you.  He is a full adult who decided to marry and have children with this woman - it is his responsibility to sort out issues with her.  Throwing a big fit and making everyone miserable for the rest of the day (I'm reading between the lines here) just because you have to deal with your own responsibilities is childish and bratty.  Do you do all if the rest of the mental and emotional labor in the house?", "NTA. At age 11  your stepdaughter should have some autonomy. But you do need to reassure her that you DO want her, you just see that she's growing up and want her to know that she has a say in her own life.", "YTA... It reads like the Bio Mom is playing you like a fiddle.", "YTA. Ordinarily I would say that it\u2019s very good to ask children what they want, but when it comes to the mother who abandoned her child, the adults should discuss first. In a situation where the potential fallout will be shared, the decision making should be shared. \n\nAlso. People don\u2019t like the bio mom because she is a piece of work. It\u2019s absolutely none of her business what kind of her party is being thrown for her child otherwise and I\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know this. She\u2019s manipulating you and leaving you to get told off. Wise up, OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Therapy.\n\nYour husband is the biggest A here for foisting the burden of communication regarding his kids, onto you. If a simple email from the mother of his children can ruin his day, he needs individual therapy.\n\nYour step kids are being used as manipulation tools by their bio mom. It sounds like step daughter has pretty big abandonment issues. They need individual and family therapy. \n\nYou are shouldering the burden of being the only reasonable adult in the family and you might consider individual therapy but should at least look into couples therapy to help explain why you should never have had to handle any of this in the first place, let alone be castigated for it.", "NTA.  It's actually super refreshing that you asked although it sounds like you may have botched it a bit.  Either that or your mother botched it for you.  I'm kind of guessing the latter.", "NTA\n\nKid is big enough to decide, and if she wanted two parties that's no big deal either.  It got twisted in a strange way.

Why would I send her away?\"  and it may bring some conversation to light.", "NTA you\u2019re being put in a terrible situation by your husband AND your own family and (of course) the ex wife. You\u2019re the step mom and getting to coordinate everything and then getting shit for it! That\u2019s not ok. \n\nI do agree with some here that you should have told the mom she can throw something if she wanted but you would not be changing your plans. That would have been for the best. The daughter is 11 and making her feel like it has to be one or the other is unfair. She doesn\u2019t want to disappoint anyone. You are the adult and you should have simply put your foot down and told the ex wife you would not be changing plans. \n\nHowever, if your husband doesn\u2019t want to man up and deal with his ex than he needs to respect your decisions. I think it\u2019s time to tell your husband and parents that if they don\u2019t like it and you\u2019re going to be taking this much shit for a simple question than they can take over and you won\u2019t be coordinating with ex wife anymore.

The question wasn't unreasonable", "You should get everyone together and explain in full what you asked", "NTA - why are you married to someone who only has your back 20% of the time.

I think it should be separate from the mom's relationship with family. \n\nThese are still her kids, and the kids should be able to decide on their own what their relationship with their mom is.  11 is old enough to try and see if a relationship can be formed with very limited interference from.everyone else.", "I\u2019ll be honestly having been that child who\u2019s in a terrible family relationship growing I still would have wanted that choice. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong that you asked as all cuz at that age it\u2019s super vulnerable and trying to decide what and who in your life. I\u2019ve been interrogated by both sides but the one that just sticks out to me and still makes me upset was my cousin\u2019s birthday. My younger cousin wanted to talk to us for their birthday gift and my mom\u2019s second husband threatened us to ground us if we didn\u2019t get off the phone. \n\nI had mature quickly and be like uh no this is our cousin not our grandma that you apparently hate. I think around 14-16 years old I realized they were trying super hard to alienate us and it did work for a bit. I\u2019m glad you gave that choice to your SD cuz it allowed to process her own choices and what she wanted in the end.", "Yes, they are her biological kids, but you have a duty, as the person who has for all intents and purposes been their mother all this time to protect the children's feelings first. By even asking your stepdaughter to make a decision, I would not be surprised if she thought you wanted her to chose her bio-mom's party, or that you didn't want to celebrate her b-day anymore. Who knows what kind of crap that woman is filling her head with when she has her alone. That woman wanting to drop in and out of her life as she pleases is soul-crushing for the kids, your priority should be protecting your stepdaughter.", "I've been in the shoes of the Stepdaughter. It's not healthy to make her feel guilty about spending time with her mom. \n\nFrom the looks of it she wasn't upset til she spent time with Grandma. It was there that the seeds of sending her away got planted and her upset. If anyone is poisoning her it's the dad's family. \n\nThey need to back off. It should be between the children, mom and father. But unfortunately the father isn't going to be a big help since an email sets him off. They need therapy to get  these feelings in order. They don't have to forgive but throwing a tantrum every time the bio mom is brought up isn't helping anyone. \n\nDad put stepmom in a bad spot being the communicator. But as the communicator she has first notice and this first word. I think she could have told bio mom that two parties were perfectly doable and the memories would be worth it. Since the children can see she's trying to form something."]}
