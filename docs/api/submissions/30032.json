I'd also question some of these hit and run accidents (with no witnesses and no other vehicle to examine, are you SURE your MIL wasn't the one doing the hitting and running?)", "NTA for not trusting your (wife's) car with someone who has such a history of road accidents. In your place, I would have done the same thing.\n\nStatistically speaking, people who drive a car typically gets into 4-5 accidents throughout their lives. (data obtained based on insurance claims in US). So if your MIL is doing that number in a year or two, I am not sure if she should be driving the car in the first place.\n\nYou can turn her down by telling her that the car has some issues and needs to be fixed. It's dangerous for her to drive it. For context, there was issue in a car I used to drive a long back, with braking. The brake wouldn't apply for first 2-3 attempts, and would apply on fourth or fifth.. We managed to drive along with the issue for a while until finally getting it fixed. But if anyone else would have driven that car, would surely have got into an accident.", "INFO - what does your wife think? Can you get your name taken off the insurance, so if wife decides to let her mother drive, any accidents will be her issue alone to deal with? That might make her think twice?", "NTA, with that many accidents there is a chance something she does in her driving causes them. Also driving 20+ over the speed limit is reckless driving. ONe of the easiest things you can do is change your insurance so only you are covered and that will mean only you can drive the car.", "Yes it would be a cold day in hell if my wife let my mom drive her car.  With your MIL's driving record it's only a matter of time till YOUR insurance will go through the roof cost wise unless your wife stops caving to her mom.  This is just a basic financial decision, do you want to pay a fortune in insurance premiums or be the nice SIL and agree that your wife can loan her car to her mom?   In many states you and your wife could be held financially responsible for your MIL's accident if they use your/your wifes car. NTA", "Nta", "NTA - I know that the law considers the car whose front end hits another is at fault, but there\u2019s likely to be some major assholery on the part of MIL for it to happen this many times. (For ex: Slamming on the brakes unexpectedly given the conditions). \n\nHold firm - especially if she\u2019s not on your insurance.  She can rent a car.", "NTA, talk to your wife. But be willing to compromise.\n\nFor instance, is it possible to have the insurance for her car just in her name, so if she (or her mother, or someone else whom she allows to drive) gets into an accident it is only her insurance and credit that is trashed, not yours. Do you \\*need\\* to have your name on the insurance as well?  Would you MIL even be covered, if she has been declined insurance?  \n\nMaybe suggest that you talk to your insurance broker or agent . It may be that they are unwilling to have MIL drive the car given her records - is it possible that they might exclude her from cover?   Also ask about whether the insurance has to be on both names or if it can just be in your wife's name, like the car, so that any impact of her letting her mum or others drive only affects her. (I live in a jurisdiction where insurance is normally specific to the vehicle and driver , so  it's pretty easy for spouses or other members of the same household to keep their insurance totally separate, if they want) \n\nAre you sure about the circumstances of your MILs accidents? 3 hit and runs is a lot, were these incidents of her cat being hit when it was parked? If not, I'm wondering whether she may not have told you the full circumstances and there are issues with her driving ability - would your wife be open to talking to her mum about getting her health checked out or even about her giving up driving for her own safety?  \n\nMaybe suggest hat you look into getting her set up with an uber account - it may well work out cheaper then her running a car, if she was paying sky high insurance.  If not, can she rent a car when she needs one?", "Just let her crash the car, problem solved", "NAH.  You have valid concerns which you have voiced.  However, it is HER car.  She can let her mom use it.  Could you talk to her about what would happen if your MIL wrecked your wife's car?  Would MIL be liable for damages and insurance increase?   It's nice to have a plan.  I'm assuming there's no public transportation where you live.", "YTA for marrying someone and expecting them to change.\n\nGet your name off the insurance and let her make her own choices.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
