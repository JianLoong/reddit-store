Would you rather save your son or your wife?\u201d I immediately answered \u201cMy wife of course\u201d my wife gave me a weird look and asked why. I laughed and jokingly said that we could just make another baby, but I could never find a sexy, amazing woman like her again. My wife started crying and walked in a different room. I ran after her and asked why she was crying. She called me a jerk and accused me of not caring about our baby. I tried to calm her down and said I was just joking around. But she was not having it. The mood was ruined after this and we went home shortly after.\n\nNow she\u02bcs giving me the cold shoulder even though I apologized to her.

I'm sorry, but I am laughing right now. It took me a while to bond with my child after my wife delivered him. At first it just felt like he was kind of a dick who stole my girlfriend and sucked up all the oxygen in the house. This is primal shit. I meant to love him immediately. But it took a minute.\n\nBy the time he was two years old, I would have taken on a gang of angry ninjas to protect him. It takes time though. And it seems like you got caught up in a stupid party game in the middle of this process. and also while your wife is probably still pretty hormonal. Her feelings are valid, but probably exaggerated at the moment.\n\nI don't know what you should do next! I locked myself in the downstairs bathroom, called my best friend, and spilled my unspeakable secrets. I'd try to talk through it with her if you can when baby is asleep and you have a minute of peace. Work in some dates with her. (Tho keep your expectations low about romance right now.

They can try again for another baby but there's only one of his wife. \n\nI don't think that's cruel, I think that's just the way life is sometimes. \n\nOn thing people should remember is that birth is both a physical and psychological process.

Period. You\u2019re an adult and can get out. That baby needs someone. Your \u201cjoke\u201d made her feel like she\u2019s the only person looking out for that baby.

Lastly, I know it might just be a me thing but if my SO saved me instead of our child because \u201cwe could always make another one\u201d is terrible.

Your answer should've been \"That is a f-ed up question. Not answering.\" YTA\n\nThese \"would you rather\" games should be done using situations that don't place people in the spot of having to rank their loved ones or abandon/breakup with them. Includes things like which friend's cooking you'd rather have. They are relationship landmines and those who use and answer them should not be shocked that the ones referred to in that question feel upset.\n\n\nMy favorite: \"Would you rather: A) Live next to an active volcano. OR B) Reveal your browser history to parents.\"\n\nVolcano. My only choice is the volcano.", "YTA. \n\n\"we can just make another one if our newborn perishes in a house fire, dw babe\"\n\nThen \"nah, I'm not the asshole for saying that - she's the asshole for being upset about it\".\n\nI can't cope.", "Oh man - coming at this from the perspective of a currently-pregnant woman, I gotta say YTA on this one. Your intentions weren't bad but let me put it this way: I haven't even met my son yet and the mere idea of something bad happening to him is agonizing. By this point, your wife has spent 40 weeks waiting for your son, hoping nothing bad will happen, hoping he'll be okay, and now he's here and she's still probably VERY aware of how small and helpless he is. The idea of just \"making a new one\" would probably be completely devastating to her because she's invested so much of herself into him and the idea of losing him would be her worst nightmare - and you pretty much just said you'd let that happen.\n\nObviously this is hypothetical and probably not what you would actually do if this situation somehow arose in real life (mostly because she's an adult human who can take care of herself and he's a helpless infant). I don't think you're a terrible dad or husband or whatever, but this was absolutely the wrong thing to say to someone in her position right now - when she really needs to know that you are on the same page as her and that she can trust you to protect your son.", "NTA\n\nBut, like, really? A game of hypotheticals involving the life or death of close loved ones? Are we 12?

I also understand that my joke was insensitive, but I was also drunk. Am I the asshole?\n\nYou dont know if you can ever have another kid so dont say stupid shit like that. Your tempting fate and its really weird. \n\nStop making exuses for the stupid comments you made them own them and stop blaming your wife's hormones and you being drunk.", "YTA.  Not for the answer itself.  That's actually pretty common.  Most men pick the wife when asked this question.  Most women pick the child.  \n\nBut the callous and insensitive manner in which you answered the question is what makes you an asshole.  Not to mention that you think she overreacted and are blaming hormones.  \n\nAnd being drunk it no excuse.", "NTA but your friend sure is. She\u2019s a new mother she\u2019s more hormonal than a teenage boy and your friend is a jerk to put you on the spot like that", "Why do people play these dumb ass games?  But you chose wrong.  Your job as a parent is to protect your child. Your partner is an adult, they can protect themselves.  As a mom, I'd be worried too if my husband didn't feel the same way.  God forbid something terrible happened and he chose saving me over saving our son, it would end me anyway. My child would be dead and I could never forgive my husband. It would be the end of our marriage. YTA", "YTA. Not for the answer you chose. It makes sense you care more about your wife than a 2 month old. You don't really *know* the 2 month old yet. But where the AH behavior comes in is once you noticed you upset your wife (aka this part \"my wife gave me a weird look and asked why\") you can't make a joke about it anymore. That's where you screwed up. In your wife's head, this was something serious, and you made light of it.", "Your friend is an AH for asking such a ridiculous and upsetting question as a \"game.\" YTA for joking in a way that made your wife feel like sh!t and implied that she's a machine for making interchangeable babies. You should have refused to answer your friend's stupid question.", "YTA not for picking your wife by for saying \"we can just make another baby\" because while I doubt it was your intention, that makes it sound like you wouldn't care if your son died and would just have another kid. Never say to the mother of your child, even jokingly, that if your child died you would just make another.\n\nAlso your wife can make it out a burning building by herself your 2 month baby can't lol", "NAH. She's a new mother, and gave birth a couple months ago, so I'm sure her head is flooded with all kinds of hypotheticals, what-ifs, fears, and doubts about the human being you guys just made (and hormones too), so she probably had a pretty emotional response to your answer. \n\nYou were also shoved into an awkward position by your friend who asked you if you would save your wife or newborn child from death (who the hell asks someone a question like that in front of their wife?) and did your best to make a joke about it to alleviate the weirdness that comes along with a question like that. If anyone is even close to the AH, it's David. Questions like that don't have a good answer, and put the questioned person in a lose-lose situation.", "NTA because the question, no matter who you would chose to save, means one would die. The question guarantees you would be labeled the TA. The correct response would be not playing  the game.", "This type of situation always reminds me of a clip of Family Fued where the two guys just look at each other and in a split second agree to just NOPE out of answering a question. This is the way.", "INFO\n\nYou said you were drunk. Does that mean your wife was sober? You weren't relaxing equally.\n\nAlso, do any of those other friends have kids? Parents know better than to ask existential hypotheticals like that.", "Trick question... there was no right answer.  She'll get over it.", "NAH i feel like there was no right answer for this question and honestly it feels a bit weird to ask when you like, JUST had the baby. But she did just give birth so I can understand why she\u2019s upset, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong the situation was just weird.", "NAH, but your friend set you up for failure. There is no right answer to that question, especially when pregnancy hormones are involved. When that baby comes though, you will know the right answer. Fatherhood is awesome.", "NAH - I had this discussion with my boyfriend the other day and he answered the same as OP, I answered the same as the wife. We even googled it after and turns out it\u2019s just a gender thing. Not all people answer the same obviously but most men seem to answer wife whereas women tend to choose their child", "NTA she might have been even angrier if you'd left her to burn. \n\nMaybe say that together you had a better chance to save the baby", "NTA... and pretty typical response. My ex (17 yrs ltr) always said he would be the same way.... thinking there is a level of instinct there.", "The asshole in this situation is \u201cDavid.\u201d  That\u2019s a no-win question.  Neither of the \u201cI would let (A or B) die\u201d has a pat answer that\u2019s guaranteed safe.  It\u2019s far from certain that even she has a reliable preferred answer. Either answer could get her angry depending on how she\u2019s feeling at the particular moment she hears it.\n\nDavid probably knows perfectly well how fraught that question is, and you should carefully consider how much of him you want around, when he so obviously enjoys stirring up trouble.", "YTA\n\n If the house was on fire and my husband saved me and let our two kids die I'd be leaving his ass immediately.  I would never feel the same way about him again. \n\n\nThankfully part of why I love my husband so much is because he loves the kids as fiercely and deeply as I do.", "My husband and I don\u2019t have kids, but if there was a fire, we would both be saving our cats and dogs. We are both able-bodied adults who can get out on our own and don\u2019t need to be saved by the other. I feel the same should be done for kids. Both parents focus on saving the children.", "YTA, your comment about being able to make another baby was bad but then blaming hormones for her \u201coverreacting\u201d?! Being drunk isn\u2019t an excuse for making insensitive comments in the heat of the moment and I\u2019m assuming you were sober when you made the misogynistic hormone comment.", "NAH. I think the \u201cwe can just have another one\u201d comment is what made your statement bad, but I can understand and honestly respect your logic.", "YTA.  Do you tell that to everyone that loses a child? God forbid you ACTUALLY have to help yours in a life-threatening situation.", "Oh YTA most definitely.  Your drunken joke made it sound like you were more interested in a sexy woman than your son.", "NTA. It was hypothetical situation and you gave a hypothetical answer. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA- as a mother, she was well within her rights to get that upset!!! \nOnce your child is born, you will kill for that child and they come before anyone or anything.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know they have a bond but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a strong as a mothers as they haven\u2019t carried the baby and gone through what we went through.

First,  this is a stupid question that nobody should ever ask, but they do all the time.  \n\nI have 2 children myself who I would not hesitate to risk my life for. That's my primary job as their parent, keep them safe. Their job is to grow up and develop into their own people and grow their own families, independent of their parents.\n\nOn the other hand, my job as partner/spouse is to love and support and nurture and grow WITH the person I chose. Ideally, forever. \n\nIt's a different kind of love and I'm inclined to believe that my answer to this question would differ depending on the circumstances. Realistically, my knee-jerk reaction as a parent in an immediate emergency would probably be to save my kids because they need my help more. But if given time to think about who I'm saving....\n\nBetween you and me and the internet - my husband is my absolute favorite person. Full stop.", "YTA, you told a mother that you would save her before her child", "People tend to say stupid things when they are drunk, your wife has a reason to get angry at you, but she should understand, mother's have 9 whole months to bond with their children emotionally, the same can't be applied to father's, because It will take time for them to accept there is another member in the family.\n\nYou are NTA, but you were an insensitive prick when you are drunk, cause you're pretty sure that your wife's harmones are all over the place.", "YTA. The correct answer is always both. Either we all make it out alive or we all burn to death together.", "YTA.

God, I feel bad for the partners in those relationships. Imagine making one small mistake and suddenly your an abuser. Cue eye roll.\n\nFinally going to address the issue of who should you choose. Ultimately, As a couple you really should be on the same page and it really ought to be something you discuss. We did. Who can you live most without?\n\n For my husband and I, the most important people in our lives are each other. We chose each other. We will be each others company for life. Your parents are around for a long time, but then they die. Same goes for your children. Your job is to love and raise them, teach them all you can. But then you LET.THEM.GO. Who is still with you after that? Your partner.  I think people who priortise their children over their relationship will 100% end in divorce or have empty nest issues (which will mess your kid heaps even if they are adults, speaking from exp here). I noticed some people saying they wouldn\u2019t forgive their SO if they didn\u2019t choose the child in an impossible situation. Sorry my babes, unless you are both 100% on that page your relationship probably ain\u2019t going to last\u2026 when I say prioritise your relationship, that doesn\u2019t mean baby comes last. there are periods in your life, where your relationship does go on temporary hold Because your energy does need to be spent elsewhere like the first 6 months. But you can\u2019t go putting your relationship on hold indefinitely. That\u2019s how you turn from partners to housemates. I am the love of my husbands life and I would never shame him for saying so. It\u2019s really endearing and I know that our dedication to each other will in turn create a warm and healthy family home for our child. They will grow up experiencing parents who really love each other. Also people, remember boundaries with your children is not anti love, you still need to come out of the next 20 years mentally and emotionally intact. Otherwise, why bother?", "NAH. There are games literally sold that have questions EXACTLY like these, and thousands of people enjoy playing them. When it's a game like this, you CAN NOT get upset about the answers.

Additionally, if she feels at ALL like you aren\u2019t contributing as much to childcare, now she\u2019s going to spend a lot of time wondering if it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t bonded with your baby. You need to sit her down and have a serious conversation about how much you love her AND your baby, and you made a dumb joke, but you deeply love your son etc etc. Even if she wasn\u2019t postpartum, I\u2019d find that (myself) to be something you can\u2019t joke about, but I\u2019m aware my boundaries might be different from yours.

It's the same as asking if you had two children and could only save one, which one would you choose.
