Would you rather save your son or your wife?\u201d I immediately answered \u201cMy wife of course\u201d my wife gave me a weird look and asked why. I laughed and jokingly said that we could just make another baby, but I could never find a sexy, amazing woman like her again. My wife started crying and walked in a different room. I ran after her and asked why she was crying. She called me a jerk and accused me of not caring about our baby. I tried to calm her down and said I was just joking around. But she was not having it. The mood was ruined after this and we went home shortly after.\n\nNow she\u02bcs giving me the cold shoulder even though I apologized to her.

I'm sorry, but I am laughing right now. It took me a while to bond with my child after my wife delivered him. At first it just felt like he was kind of a dick who stole my girlfriend and sucked up all the oxygen in the house. This is primal shit. I meant to love him immediately. But it took a minute.\n\nBy the time he was two years old, I would have taken on a gang of angry ninjas to protect him. It takes time though. And it seems like you got caught up in a stupid party game in the middle of this process. and also while your wife is probably still pretty hormonal. Her feelings are valid, but probably exaggerated at the moment.\n\nI don't know what you should do next! I locked myself in the downstairs bathroom, called my best friend, and spilled my unspeakable secrets. I'd try to talk through it with her if you can when baby is asleep and you have a minute of peace. Work in some dates with her. (Tho keep your expectations low about romance right now.

They can try again for another baby but there's only one of his wife. \n\nI don't think that's cruel, I think that's just the way life is sometimes. \n\nOn thing people should remember is that birth is both a physical and psychological process.

Period. You\u2019re an adult and can get out. That baby needs someone. Your \u201cjoke\u201d made her feel like she\u2019s the only person looking out for that baby.

Lastly, I know it might just be a me thing but if my SO saved me instead of our child because \u201cwe could always make another one\u201d is terrible.

Your answer should've been \"That is a f-ed up question. Not answering.\" YTA\n\nThese \"would you rather\" games should be done using situations that don't place people in the spot of having to rank their loved ones or abandon/breakup with them. Includes things like which friend's cooking you'd rather have. They are relationship landmines and those who use and answer them should not be shocked that the ones referred to in that question feel upset.\n\n\nMy favorite: \"Would you rather: A) Live next to an active volcano. OR B) Reveal your browser history to parents.\"\n\nVolcano. My only choice is the volcano.", "YTA. \n\n\"we can just make another one if our newborn perishes in a house fire, dw babe\"\n\nThen \"nah, I'm not the asshole for saying that - she's the asshole for being upset about it\".\n\nI can't cope.", "Oh man - coming at this from the perspective of a currently-pregnant woman, I gotta say YTA on this one. Your intentions weren't bad but let me put it this way: I haven't even met my son yet and the mere idea of something bad happening to him is agonizing. By this point, your wife has spent 40 weeks waiting for your son, hoping nothing bad will happen, hoping he'll be okay, and now he's here and she's still probably VERY aware of how small and helpless he is. The idea of just \"making a new one\" would probably be completely devastating to her because she's invested so much of herself into him and the idea of losing him would be her worst nightmare - and you pretty much just said you'd let that happen.\n\nObviously this is hypothetical and probably not what you would actually do if this situation somehow arose in real life (mostly because she's an adult human who can take care of herself and he's a helpless infant). I don't think you're a terrible dad or husband or whatever, but this was absolutely the wrong thing to say to someone in her position right now - when she really needs to know that you are on the same page as her and that she can trust you to protect your son.", "NTA\n\nBut, like, really? A game of hypotheticals involving the life or death of close loved ones? Are we 12?

I also understand that my joke was insensitive, but I was also drunk. Am I the asshole?\n\nYou dont know if you can ever have another kid so dont say stupid shit like that. Your tempting fate and its really weird. \n\nStop making exuses for the stupid comments you made them own them and stop blaming your wife's hormones and you being drunk.", "YTA.  Not for the answer itself.  That's actually pretty common.  Most men pick the wife when asked this question.  Most women pick the child.  \n\nBut the callous and insensitive manner in which you answered the question is what makes you an asshole.  Not to mention that you think she overreacted and are blaming hormones.  \n\nAnd being drunk it no excuse.", "NTA but your friend sure is. She\u2019s a new mother she\u2019s more hormonal than a teenage boy and your friend is a jerk to put you on the spot like that", "Why do people play these dumb ass games?  But you chose wrong.  Your job as a parent is to protect your child. Your partner is an adult, they can protect themselves.  As a mom, I'd be worried too if my husband didn't feel the same way.  God forbid something terrible happened and he chose saving me over saving our son, it would end me anyway. My child would be dead and I could never forgive my husband. It would be the end of our marriage. YTA", "YTA. Not for the answer you chose. It makes sense you care more about your wife than a 2 month old. You don't really *know* the 2 month old yet. But where the AH behavior comes in is once you noticed you upset your wife (aka this part \"my wife gave me a weird look and asked why\") you can't make a joke about it anymore. That's where you screwed up. In your wife's head, this was something serious, and you made light of it.", "Your friend is an AH for asking such a ridiculous and upsetting question as a \"game.\" YTA for joking in a way that made your wife feel like sh!t and implied that she's a machine for making interchangeable babies. You should have refused to answer your friend's stupid question.", "YTA not for picking your wife by for saying \"we can just make another baby\" because while I doubt it was your intention, that makes it sound like you wouldn't care if your son died and would just have another kid. Never say to the mother of your child, even jokingly, that if your child died you would just make another.\n\nAlso your wife can make it out a burning building by herself your 2 month baby can't lol", "NAH. She's a new mother, and gave birth a couple months ago, so I'm sure her head is flooded with all kinds of hypotheticals, what-ifs, fears, and doubts about the human being you guys just made (and hormones too), so she probably had a pretty emotional response to your answer. \n\nYou were also shoved into an awkward position by your friend who asked you if you would save your wife or newborn child from death (who the hell asks someone a question like that in front of their wife?) and did your best to make a joke about it to alleviate the weirdness that comes along with a question like that. If anyone is even close to the AH, it's David. Questions like that don't have a good answer, and put the questioned person in a lose-lose situation.", "NTA because the question, no matter who you would chose to save, means one would die. The question guarantees you would be labeled the TA. The correct response would be not playing  the game.", "This type of situation always reminds me of a clip of Family Fued where the two guys just look at each other and in a split second agree to just NOPE out of answering a question. This is the way.", "INFO\n\nYou said you were drunk. Does that mean your wife was sober? You weren't relaxing equally.\n\nAlso, do any of those other friends have kids? Parents know better than to ask existential hypotheticals like that.", "Trick question... there was no right answer.  She'll get over it.", "NAH i feel like there was no right answer for this question and honestly it feels a bit weird to ask when you like, JUST had the baby. But she did just give birth so I can understand why she\u2019s upset, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong the situation was just weird.", "NAH, but your friend set you up for failure. There is no right answer to that question, especially when pregnancy hormones are involved. When that baby comes though, you will know the right answer. Fatherhood is awesome.", "NAH - I had this discussion with my boyfriend the other day and he answered the same as OP, I answered the same as the wife. We even googled it after and turns out it\u2019s just a gender thing. Not all people answer the same obviously but most men seem to answer wife whereas women tend to choose their child", "NTA she might have been even angrier if you'd left her to burn. \n\nMaybe say that together you had a better chance to save the baby", "NTA... and pretty typical response. My ex (17 yrs ltr) always said he would be the same way.... thinking there is a level of instinct there.", "The asshole in this situation is \u201cDavid.\u201d  That\u2019s a no-win question.  Neither of the \u201cI would let (A or B) die\u201d has a pat answer that\u2019s guaranteed safe.  It\u2019s far from certain that even she has a reliable preferred answer. Either answer could get her angry depending on how she\u2019s feeling at the particular moment she hears it.\n\nDavid probably knows perfectly well how fraught that question is, and you should carefully consider how much of him you want around, when he so obviously enjoys stirring up trouble.", "YTA\n\n If the house was on fire and my husband saved me and let our two kids die I'd be leaving his ass immediately.  I would never feel the same way about him again. \n\n\nThankfully part of why I love my husband so much is because he loves the kids as fiercely and deeply as I do.", "My husband and I don\u2019t have kids, but if there was a fire, we would both be saving our cats and dogs. We are both able-bodied adults who can get out on our own and don\u2019t need to be saved by the other. I feel the same should be done for kids. Both parents focus on saving the children.", "YTA, your comment about being able to make another baby was bad but then blaming hormones for her \u201coverreacting\u201d?! Being drunk isn\u2019t an excuse for making insensitive comments in the heat of the moment and I\u2019m assuming you were sober when you made the misogynistic hormone comment.", "NAH. I think the \u201cwe can just have another one\u201d comment is what made your statement bad, but I can understand and honestly respect your logic.", "YTA.  Do you tell that to everyone that loses a child? God forbid you ACTUALLY have to help yours in a life-threatening situation.", "Oh YTA most definitely.  Your drunken joke made it sound like you were more interested in a sexy woman than your son.", "NTA. It was hypothetical situation and you gave a hypothetical answer. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA- as a mother, she was well within her rights to get that upset!!! \nOnce your child is born, you will kill for that child and they come before anyone or anything.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know they have a bond but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a strong as a mothers as they haven\u2019t carried the baby and gone through what we went through.

First,  this is a stupid question that nobody should ever ask, but they do all the time.  \n\nI have 2 children myself who I would not hesitate to risk my life for. That's my primary job as their parent, keep them safe. Their job is to grow up and develop into their own people and grow their own families, independent of their parents.\n\nOn the other hand, my job as partner/spouse is to love and support and nurture and grow WITH the person I chose. Ideally, forever. \n\nIt's a different kind of love and I'm inclined to believe that my answer to this question would differ depending on the circumstances. Realistically, my knee-jerk reaction as a parent in an immediate emergency would probably be to save my kids because they need my help more. But if given time to think about who I'm saving....\n\nBetween you and me and the internet - my husband is my absolute favorite person. Full stop.", "YTA, you told a mother that you would save her before her child", "People tend to say stupid things when they are drunk, your wife has a reason to get angry at you, but she should understand, mother's have 9 whole months to bond with their children emotionally, the same can't be applied to father's, because It will take time for them to accept there is another member in the family.\n\nYou are NTA, but you were an insensitive prick when you are drunk, cause you're pretty sure that your wife's harmones are all over the place.", "YTA. The correct answer is always both. Either we all make it out alive or we all burn to death together.", "YTA.

Ultimately, As a couple you really should be on the same page and it really ought to be something you discuss. We did. Who can you live most without?\n\n For my husband and I, the most important people in our lives are each other. We chose each other. We will be each others company for life. Your parents are around for a long time, but then they die. Same goes for your children. Your job is to love and raise them, teach them all you can. But then you LET.THEM.GO. Who is still with you after that? Your partner.  I think people who priortise their children over their relationship will 100% end in divorce or have empty nest issues (which will mess your kid heaps even if they are adults, speaking from exp here). I noticed some people saying they wouldn\u2019t forgive their SO if they didn\u2019t choose the child in an impossible situation. Sorry my babes, unless you are both 100% on that page your relationship probably ain\u2019t going to last\u2026 when I say prioritise your relationship, that doesn\u2019t mean baby comes last. there are periods in your life, where your relationship does go on temporary hold Because your energy does need to be spent elsewhere like the first 6 months. But you can\u2019t go putting your relationship on hold indefinitely. That\u2019s how you turn from partners to housemates. I am the love of my husbands life and I would never shame him for saying so. It\u2019s really endearing and I know that our dedication to each other will in turn create a warm and healthy family home for our child. They will grow up experiencing parents who really love each other. Also people, remember boundaries with your children is not anti love, you still need to come out of the next 20 years mentally and emotionally intact. Otherwise, why bother?", "NAH.

You take any mammal on the earth, put to them that question, every male will answer the same. Only humans are even really capable of the kind of thought and self-awareness to choose the other way. The child costs the male very few resources, comparatively, and the male is capable of creating a great many of them with suitable opportunity, far more than the female over a lifetime. It serves the evolutionary interest best for the male to treat it this way, so that more children are born. And on the other hand, it serves the evolutionary interest best for the female to really hate that, and to make sure the male understands that if he is not going to put the child first he doesn't *get* to make any more, so that as many of the children born as possible have as many resources as possible being dedicated to them.\n\nI hate saying male and female that much and sounding all Tate-y, but this is just biology. Humans do not have to act or think like this, because they are sentient and sapient beings, and it is very good that we constructed a society and culture among our species in which people willingly dedicate themselves to the welfare of children wholly unrelated to them, thinking only of that other sapient being's welfare and no evolutionary imperative, but they *do* feel like this, because of the hormones in their blood and the synapses in their brain being built to make them feel like that.\n\n(Dogs/wolves/canids also do that, in case anybody here didn't love dogs enough yet.)", "Didn't think I'd have to scroll so far down to find a good answer", "As first aid worker you don't know if there is a dad in the picture so I understand your reasoning.", "Would you rather is only ever really fun with the outlandish questions like, \"Your mom and girlfriend have switched minds, and to change them back you have to pick one.

Idk why she thought it was cool to tell everyone and, for his whole life, point out to my uncle that his dad didn\u2019t pick him. So, your original point of wtf is wrong with him still stands.", "I don't necessarily agree. What if you were a parent to 3 kids and your spouse & one kid were in an accident and you could only save one. Would you rather be a whole parental unit with 2 children or a single parent with 3? What would be best for the children? So many of these AITA, people were born & their mom died & with the suffering they went through after that, they would have rather their mom lived & they had died. That statement is too blanket to just say it is always the best choice.", "Why? You love who you live. Some parents don\u2019t even like their kids.", "As someone who's from a devoriced family, and can look around at how normal that is.\n\nPartners come and go, kids are forever.", "Maybe we shouldn\u2019t constant try to quantify the unquantifiable.  \n\nOr project some set of rules on everyone.", "This.. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d save you, I mean we can always just risk your life and sacrifice your body to make another one. Plus, all I have to do is ejaculate so it\u2019s an easy win win\u2026\u201d\n\nI get that it\u2019s a joke, but like downplaying pregnancy and childbirth right after a woman has gone through it and is still dealing with newborn/ post partum hormones\u2026 not a good move!", "That, or you brought her the wrong cheese: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129i3y1/aita_for_telling_my_wife/", "I didn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t going to be judgmental.

Personality is already there before birth.", "I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not the thing to say to her right now", "Read the comments, there is more ways than a joke out of that situation which doesn't have to make it weird. The question wasn't a game anymore, but a test and he failed.", ">I would hate everybody who would save me rather than my children.\n\nEven your partner?", "I think OC was referring to the hypothetical scenario as \u201cit,\u201d not the baby.", "Oh wow. I misread that. Still hard to glean that based on one off color comment. I still say that dude was set up to fail from the beginning.", "Yeah, it was a loaded question, guaranteed to get shit on no matter what his answer was.", "I hate how nobody will voice these testimonies while you're pregnant. We felt so guilty when our daughter was born because there was so much resentment. We thought we were failures because literally everyone said you'll love them from birth. When these same people would later say, \"I remember that phase,\" we felt so betrayed. Like, you could have spared us so much pain by being honest.\n\nWe love her to death now, but I will never lie to an expecting parent. It takes time, patience, and most importantly, the desire to bond. If you have those, your heart will pull a Grinch- it will grow three sizes.", "Even logistically, going for the kid makes far more sense than going for a presumably able-bodied, reasonable adult who would also understand to evacuate from a fire.\n\nThe kid is a kid, and young enough literally cannot evacuate alone, even older kids may not be able to.", "Right, it makes sense that you would be livid. There are only two people in the world that can be trusted to care more for your kid than they do themselves, and that's you two. If he bails on that, then you're on your own. \n\nMy husband better not be saving me in any house fire. I am betting on him to do anything he can to keep our six year old alive because I can't be the only one with this kind of responsibility.", "Agreed.  A couple has to trust each other to protect their child above all else.", "A partner is someone who you have the luck of found in the world, met each other, bound, love and decide is the person who you do want to spend the rest of your life.\n\nA kid just born. Of course you accept them and love them but is not the same.", "Oh sister in law 100%.\n\nI don\u2019t have one but that\u2019s gotta be better then your mom lol", "Sometimes i just like to get naked and bury myself beneath some dirt and pretend to be an earthworm for a day.", "Yeah, my answer would be \u201cSpouse is a strong and competent adult who has a chance at getting out themself, and baby is a BABY, so\u2026\u201d", "Damn well I mean if you hate your kid, sure I guess lol", "This is the real question. Does Dave always start drama?", "I don't want to make it sound like a sure thing by any means, just that I think OP should consider the possibility. If there are other signs David might be feeling like OP has been ignoring him a lot lately, then noticing those signs is an opportunity to adjust course and make sure the friendship stays in good shape.", "I do not, because my parents had a one of a kind love for another. Not everyone has that. You have to have a balance between the 2.", "It is a joke and actually not even invented by him. It's an old one.", "I had complications with my youngest and almost died. Husband told the doctor, if you have to choose, you save my wife. I said wtf is wrong with you, I am a grown ass woman, looked at doc and said save my baby. Doc looks at both of us all crazy and says \u201cmy job is to save BOTH of you\u201d. I was like, yeah that\u2019s a better plan. Do that. \ud83d\ude02", "Hahahahaha this is true. I also think there are many people who really don't understand the dynamic of finding someone you love. They just has a disposition that children are first and foremost but in reality that's just not how it actually works.", "I am going to be honest I love my kids but there are times when I don\u2019t like them.

It's like gambling with your life choices", "Yeah but see all of that is irrelevant it was a game and she overeacted", "It was a game not a life talk.", "I read them, I guess I just don't agree with you. How did you determine that he \"failed\" this test? It seems to me that it's a subjective question, with either answer being virtually guaranteed to cause some level of offense, so who decided what the \"right\" answer is?", "No it doesn't. I loved my son more than anything even before he was born. There is absolutely zero effort needed to bond with your child.\n\nWhat sick jokes you people are pulling here?", "I asked my partner. He was all, \"I don't even like worms, so no.\"\n\nHarsh, man. Harsh.", "Whatever.", "I'm not going to continue because it will devolve.\n\nWe come from two different worlds. So I won't understand and neither will you.\n\nI just hope you recognize your born into a type of privilege and have compassion for those without.

Kids aren't all incapable of dark humor.", "I like your doctor.", "Regardless it\u2019s clearly differing opinions born out of love and isn\u2019t something to hold long term resentment over. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have you in my life than our child.\u201d =/= \u201cI don\u2019t love our child.\u201d you know? \n\nPeople get wild about this", "\u201cYou fool\u201d stfu.

She won\u2019t be the same person and in my case, would no longer be a partner. If mine chose to let my child die, divorce would happen if I didn\u2019t kill him in a fit of rage first. \n\nThat last sentence sounds horrible, I love my husband but even the thought of that scenario had me get murderous thoughts \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah sounds like a lot of drama over a game.", "Your lived experience is beautiful, but that doesn't mean it will apply to everyone.", "My parents divorced when I was two and my dad has largely been an absent, terrible father. I still find the comment funny.", "Hahahaha our eldest has a sense of humor that is wildly taken out of context. Many who don't know him well or us that well look to us for reassurance of laughter. He's got that dead pan comedy down.", "I'm sorry , the fool part was too much.\n\nAlthough you shouldn't care how they look, and should show interest in what they like or at least support their interest.\n\nIm not speaking of extremes, obviously there are kids born with mild to extreme issues, or they could become interested in mild to extremely bad things.\n\nUnconditional love in theory wouldn't matter how they look or what they are into, specially as a baby or toddler.", "Oh I'm not saying we can.\nBut I just mean like judging a new born like wrong.\nYou raise them, could they still turn out to be an asshole douchebage, dick, etc.\nSure. Or even worse!\n\nBut that doesn't mean your S/O can't turn that way, or you can't, or anyone can't.\n\nI'm still picking my toddler over my wife.\nWe are talking about a 2 month old baby, not a 16-30 year old for example.", "So you would repeat your father's behaviour and dip? Or correct it and be there because that's your kid?\n\nI'd be all about my kid even after I separated from the mom. I'd be the opposite of my dad and my mom.\n\n....I'm projecting a lot in this post.\n\nImma die on that hill tho that he should have picked his baby over his wife.\n\n...it is kinda funny because OP is trying hard towards his wife which is fine, but I don't blame her for being pissed. I don't think it's cool she reacted AS strongly...but I get it.", "Thank you for apologizing but Bestie that\u2019s not my point. I get that kids deserve unconditional love but someone asked what the joke was with \u201cI chose her\u201d whether you love your kids to the fullest extent or not you don\u2019t choose them in the same way that you choose a life partner", "We\u2019re specifically talking about a comment where a joke was made about a husband saying he loves his wife more because he chose her.

You replied to a comment thread, not to the post itself.", "To me, you chose to have the kid hypothetically, or at least choose to keep, stay around etc.\n\nThe fact you didn't pick your kid out from a life of dating means more to me.\nMore than a wife, I've been commenting, I'm from the world were people come and go, marriages don't last, people don't stay together for ever.\nKids remain tho. Your kid is your kid.\n\nI could love my wife with all my life, but my kid is more than that.
