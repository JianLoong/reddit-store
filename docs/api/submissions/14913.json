I guess she never saw him as a \u201creal\u201d grandchild? \n\nYour reasoning was fine, I think you handled the communication fine as well and it was a good compromise even if the recital you had missed was the bigger one.\n\nIn my house the question wouldn\u2019t have been which event are the parents going to (because it was a relatively important play for your son), but whether the sister would be allowed to do her recital at all, or whether she would be asked to attend her brother\u2019s thing! Her thing is a once a month frequent event, so missing one or two especially at 10 with many many dance years left seems like a small ask.", "NTA.\n\nI think you were damned if you did and damned if you didn't on this one.  Your daughter and son are the only opinions on this that matter, and if they were happy with your decision then that should be good enough for anyone else.", "Um, NTA.  I have three children of my own and two step children, so I feel your pain.  You literally can\u2019t be in two places at the same time, you discussed it ahead of time, and it is really gross of them now to come at you like this, and even grosser for making the \u201cfull blood\u201d vs \u201cstep child\u201d argument.  Boooooh.  I hate people like that.", "NTA, sometimes you have to miss one. 2 kids with 2 lives and you\u2019re one person. Can\u2019t make everything.", "NTA cos you didn't randomly decide to go to the play, you actually considered options and reasons and had a plan. Your ex is TAH.", "NTA. You put a lot of thought into your reason and your daughter understood. It\u2019s you ex-that is the ass!", "Nta and your husband lost all of his credibility when he has the affairs", "If there two different events for two different kids at the same you just can't be on both events. \n\nMaybe you could have told earlier, that you don't attend the balett for with your daughter. \n\nHowever you should try to attend 50% of each kid, if there is a time collision, so you don't play favorites in the long term.", "NTA. You discussed it with your daughter and made alternative plans to spend time with her, and enjoy her performance this one time that it's on video rather than IRL. You're doing fine, dad.", "If your story it true no sane person would call you the AH.  IMO the only persons who\u2019s opinion counts is your daughter.  Tell Lisa if I respected you as a person I would care what you say, but I don\u2019t so\u2026.. Tell your mom to stay in her lane.", "NTA he is your kid!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSounds like the mom is putting her own insecurities about you putting her daughter 2nd out into the world but the reality of the world are situations just like this. You explained why it was important for you to do this, she clearly understood and making make-up plans with you tells me that reaction was likely valid and not just protecting your feelings.\n\nYou're raising your kid to understand the world doesn't always revolve around them but that no matter what you'll always be there when they need you. Good parenting if you ask me", "This. \n\nNTA", "If his son is his son, then the fact that it wasn\u2019t the big recital is irrelevant here. I think he would have been on solid ground either way.", "There's one more showing but I can't go because I have a surgery scheduled on that day, the other doctor who can do it is going on leave , and its the type of surgery you can't delay", "You did read the part where she says she's fine with it right? And that Op's gonna watch the mini recital with her at home. And the fact that the son got the lead row and its his last ever play, right?", "You did read the part where she says she's fine with it right? And that Op's gonna watch the mini recital with her at home. And the fact that the son got the lead row and its his last ever play, right?\n\nWhat about the son?\n\nHey son I'm not coming to your play, because my bio daughter's mini recital which happens 12 times a year and that I'll have more future opportunities to watch is much more important than the last play you'll probably ever do", "Classic reddit overreaction. In case you missed his occupation, I doubt this is the first or last time it will happen and a young kid can understand if you talk to them.", "This comment cracked me up. Wow, no offense but you sound like you have issues and are projecting them. To each their own opinion though.\n\nBut imagine that convo:\n\nCarmen: Hey dad you're not allowed to walk me down the isle because you missed one of my mini recitals you know which happens at least once a month, even though you mostly attended all the previous ones in the past\n\nNTA OP", "One dance recital at 10yrs old and he's out as father of the bride, classic reddit overreaction.", "NTA.   You made the right choice.  Do everything you can to go to the big dance recital.  Guaranteed you weren't the only parent who missed the mini recital.\n\nIgnore all the noise coming from your ex's side.", "Was the video recorded even", "Or he was an acrobat. :P", "Smart, having 2 kids play the same role. If one kid got sick or something, they other can step in", "I read it.\n\nShe is 10. You can buy her off with ice cream.\n\nShe is also the one who has a mother that WILL use this against OP.\n\nThe Son is 18, as OP said he doesn\u2019t promise to be at any of these, the son will obviously have been disappointed, but would understand better, would appreciate more the one on one trip that OP is going to be doing to make up for missing the event, and as for it being the last time the son does a play - not likely, OP will have many more opportunities to see them in a play.", "Yes a 10 year old is going to understand.\n\nBut they are also 10, so how long are they going to join everything together, especially when OPs ex, and mother will be pointing this out for years to come - I guarantee that the daughter will be angry over this within the next 6 months.\n\nOP is also going to spend the rest of his daughters life missing things, so you think that \u201cjust one more\u201d won\u2019t make a difference\u2026. I pity your relationship with your kids if you think that every single opportunity to spend time with them isn\u2019t important.\n\nOP had a difficult decision to make, but he made the wrong one imo.\n\nBut hey it\u2019s not my relationship with my daughter that will be damaged by this", "I stated my opinion, so you are the one that needs to chill and tone down making assumptions for the daughter's feelings. Just because she told him she's OK with it, it doesn't mean she didn't feel hurt at the end of the day and won't remember that her own father told her that her thing is not that important. \n\nAlso it's not stated anywhere that this is the only event of hers that he missed.", "OP's cheating EX is just trying to cause drama where there is none.  It's like a specialty shared by all asshole EXs all across the planet.\n\nIgnore the EX, if it wasn't this they'd probably just be complaining and blaming you about something else.  Treat her as the hot air that she is.  Focus only your daughter and your son.\n\nOh, and have a discussion with your mom about butting into none-of-her-business, on why she's listening to your cheating EX about anything at all, and on why she doesn't appear to see *your son* as one of her grandkids.\n\nNTA.", "[removed]", ">Fuck your ex and while I\u2019m at it, fuck your mum.\n\nNo, don\u2019t do these things. That could be\u2026 problematic.", "My school did this thirty years ago.  And a third of the performers ended up in NYC or LA pursuing entertainment as a career.\n\nThey were all competitive and dramatic of course, but not cutthroat.\n\nYour school sounds like a nightmare.", "Who cares what the mother thinks? She can't physically do any damage to OP, she can't even take him to court over it.\n\nAre you willfully blind? Its says that its the kids last ever play", "You can't guarantee shit, and he can't control his ex. He can talk to his daughter like he did here and try to explain the situation. Again, communication is key. He works in the medical field. With everything that has happened in the last 3 years, a child can understand that working in the medical field is demanding. \n\nIf the daughter gets manipulated by his ex and mom that's not on him. They would be the AHs. Parents have to work and have other responsibilities, I'm sorry your childhood must have sucked but honesty and communication prevents alienation.", "You sound like an only child. I had 3 siblings each with our own hobbies and my parents, add to the fact my dad was in the military, ended up missing a lot of my events because they were unable to get leave or because my siblings had a way more important event, and even then at 8 I understood they don't love me any less.\n\nWhat's OP supposed to do, quit his job? Or what \"Hey I can't do the surgery, which might end up costing a person's life, because my kid has a mini ballet recital which in other words is just for parents and family to sit and view their kids practice\"\n\nPlus what about his son? Its his LAST EVERY PLAY, OP has way more recitals to go to", "It is stated. Look at OP's comments. I don't know how to copy them here, but he did state that he attended all of their previous events.\nHe also didn't tell her her recital wasn't important or that her brother's theathre play was more important. You're the one making assumptions.", "And the only one making assumptions about the daughters feelings here is you. She said she understood and was fine with it, probably because her father never missed a recital before. Idk what's so hard to grasp, but you're just reaching. Seems like projectin tbh..", "Stolen from u/citizensfund82.", "Too late, we're lubed up and looking at it", "Same thing with my kids, they called them exactly that, Cast A & Cast B", "It also means there\u2019s an understudy without needing an understudy.", "He's going to college, do you know how hard that shit is? I have yet to meet anyone (and I'm 40+ and travelled a lot) who did theatre during college unless they went to a specific art college. And he's 99% not going to that type of college because OP acknowledged that its the last play", "Can\u2019t physically do any damage to OP\u2026.. no but she can cause mental and emotional distress.\n\nWho cares what the mother thinks - OP should care.\n\nShe can, will, and has been using it against OP, and has even gotten OPs mom on her side.\n\nAnd so what if the son doesn\u2019t do theatre in college, it doesn\u2019t mean he will never do theatre again.", "You and OP are stupid.\n\nOP has an ex, who he knows is going to twist things to their advantage.\n\nOP decided that out of the 2 kids he loves and cares for, that the one he spends the most time with (seeing as his sons dad isn\u2019t in the picture, and he shares custody with his ex), the one who is older, more mature and not subject to someone trying to poison them against him was the one whose event they would go to.\n\nAnd no, not an only child, but I witnessed this happening with my nephew, and while he has now reconciled with his father, it took 10 years of their life together, time they will never get back, all because some difficult choices my brother made were twisted by his ex. If it wasn\u2019t for his exes new husband forcing his ex to come clean and tell my nephew the truth they would probably still be estranged.", "Projecting or not here is irrelevant, there's always a different side of the story, and maybe I am making assumptions, whether she's fine now or not I can't know but neither do you or anyone else. \n\nBut I can guarantee you that she will not remember this in a positive manner, or see her father as the saint that everyone here likes to make him be. After all, he told her he can't be there for her, because he chose to be at some other kid's thing.\n\nEdit: btw OP wrote he went to almost all of THEIR events, not to all of HER recitals. Would love to know how much is almost all and how much of those were the daughter's recitals that he missed.", "I'm just gonna stop just because I know your still stuck this and I'm not wasting my time and energy on someone who's so stuck", "So you want him to completely abandon his son?", "Where the fuck did I say that.\n\n\nOh wait no where.\n\n\nI said he should have gone to his daughters event and explained things to the son, rather than go to the son\u2019s event and explain things to the daughter.\n\nIf its abandoning his son by doing that, then by your logic OP already abandoned his daughter."]}
