All in all, you seem like a really involved dad making thoughtful decisions, and I've no idea why your ex is making such a fuss and pulling your mum into it.\n\nAs you say, it's your stepson's last play and he has the lead role - and it's worth noting that he only had four opportunities for you to watch him throughout the year, while your daughter has twelve. (Which honestly seems pretty excessive to me - different culture I guess, but while my dance school did something fun for parents to come and watch each year, it certainly didn't put on a mini recital every single month.

Even my colleagues seemed a bit shocked when I told them about the incident? They told me I was in the clear but they still looked shocked", "Its a separate club, not a school production. There's another showing but I have a surgery scheduled on that day", "Probably be understanding - she has more recitals than him, and it's a mini recital, those are usually closer to public practice. A lead role in his last play ever is more important than a mini recital, he can go to lots more recitals of his daughter and be there for all the bug ones in the future. \n\nThey are both his children, step children are family.", "Hope you\u2019re younger than 10 since you don\u2019t seem to display the emotional maturity that OP\u2019s daughter has shown. Based on your logic, adopted children aren\u2019t to be cared for.", "He went to all of her recitals minus this one. It's a mini recital too. Chill, she'll be fine. She said so herself. \nLooks like a 10 year old has more emotional maturity and understaning than you. \nPlus, he's OP's stepson he's been raising since he was 10.

As a former theatre-adjacent kid, high school theatre in a lot of places tends to be very intense and cutthroat.\n\n\n If it's a stage play VS a musical I could see some directors maybe doing this based on wanting to be inclusive and not making anyone feel left out (not a judgment of your son's skills to be clear) , but I also know from experience a fair amount of directors or departments will have favorites and aren't afraid to trap even the loyalist of theatre kids  in supporting-cast purgatory if they're less-than-perfect.\n\n\nEdit: TIL not every school is intense about drama. Good. On one hand I get running a show that mirrors the professional world, but on the other, at the HS level they're still kids...", "I'm glad you did. You seem to genuinely care for both kids and, like me, don't really care who the parents are you just love them. I had 2 unfaithful spouses and stepkids. Dumped the spouses but continued to love the kids.", "Because so often titles like yours go on to show in comments that one child is the golden child and the other always misses out.

They split it so that everyone who auditioned could be in it. Having more than one cast is common", "Because of the virus, there were a lot of problems, this is probably only for this year. Usually all 4 teams have sperate plays, and usually 3 days for each team. Plus this isn't a school play, its from a club and the person who runs is very chill according to my son, and very inclusive.", "Theater kid from the late 90s/early 2000s here, lol, and some of our shows did have an \u201cA\u201d cast and a \u201cB\u201d cast that split the performances. It\u2019s definitely a thing. :)"]}
