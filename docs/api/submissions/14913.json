Luke's father has been absent from his life and I have taken care of him since he was 10.\n\nCarmen's very into ballet, and the club she's in holds mini recitals once a month and a big recital once a year. Luke's very into theatre and his club does 4 plays a year. I have been to almost all their events.\n\nThis month however the mini recital and the play came on the same day in a way that was impossible for me to go to both. In the end after a lot of thinking I decided to go to Luke's for the following reason's:\n\n1. It's Luke's last play since he's going to college\n2. He got the lead role\n\nI didn't promise either of them that I would be at their thing by the way. I let them know the day before because I'm in the medical sector and I usually get called in for emergencies or for other reasons.\n\nI told Carmen I wouldn't be able to come to the recital, and explained to her why, and she was really understanding (I do have to buy her ice-cream though). My ex-BIL was going in my place, so I asked him for a recording, so I could watch it with Carmen when it my custody time.\n\nAfter the play was done, my ex called me and told me I was an AH for skipping my daughter's event for some one else's kid, she got my mom into this and she's telling me the same thing.\n\nI don't think what I did was wrong, but just to make sure AITA for missing my daughter's ballet recital to go see my son's play?\n\nEdit:  There's one more but I can't go because I have a surgery and I need to stay for observation, and the other doctor who can do it is on leave. I can't postpone the surgery\n\nFor the people asking if Carmen is mine, yes she is\n\nQuick Edit: So some people getting confused about custody, so to clarify I get year round custody, my ex has 1 week and visitation on special events\n\nAlso I don't care Luke's not my flesh and blood, he could be an alien from Turo for all I care, and he will still be my son, so anyone who thinks so can please stop typing", "created_utc": 1681624491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nxfeu/aita_for_missing_my_daughters_ballet_recital_to/", "score": 2656, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a former theatre-adjacent kid, high school theatre in a lot of places tends to be very intense and cutthroat.\n\n\n If it's a stage play VS a musical I could see some directors maybe doing this based on wanting to be inclusive and not making anyone feel left out (not a judgment of your son's skills to be clear) , but I also know from experience a fair amount of directors or departments will have favorites and aren't afraid to trap even the loyalist of theatre kids  in supporting-cast purgatory if they're less-than-perfect.\n\n\nEdit: TIL not every school is intense about drama. Good. On one hand I get running a show that mirrors the professional world, but on the other, at the HS level they're still kids...", "I'm glad you did.

I get your reasoning about this being Luke's last play and him having the lead.  It sounds like your daughter does, too.  It's not like you missed the big recital.  You missed a mini-recital.  You had your ex-BIL record it for you, so it sounds like he understood the situation as well.  You modeled great adult/parenting behavior for your daughter.

I guarantee you that my SIL doesn't view my brother's daughters as \"someone else's\" kids.  My brother gets some holidays, time in the summer, and alternating weekends.  G takes the very sensible approach that my brother's kids are her kids.  My brother's ex-MIL adores G for that because she knows her granddaughters have can never have too many adults who love and care for them.

Maybe they're working, maybe they have 7 other kids at home, maybe they're just lazy couch potatoes who don't care enough to get dressed and out the door (probably a combo of the above).\n\nMost of the audience is teachers wanting to support their kiddos, and yes, a lot of us are willing to give up personal time on a Friday night to go (but I wish they would bring back the 3:30 matinee so we didn't have to stay so late).
