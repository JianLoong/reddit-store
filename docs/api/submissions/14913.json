He got the lead role\n\nI didn't promise either of them that I would be at their thing by the way. I let them know the day before because I'm in the medical sector and I usually get called in for emergencies or for other reasons. \n\nI told Carmen I wouldn't be able to come to the recital, and explained to her why, and she was really understanding (I do have to buy her ice-cream though).

They're both your children,  even if one doesn't have your blood running through their veins.  \n\nI think it's fair to say that you chose the right performance to go to that night. You also explained it to your daughter and she was very understanding. \n\nYour daughter has more recitals per year. He has the lead role and it's a big deal for it being his last performance before college too. You even made arrangements to watch her performance after. \n\nYour ex sucks.  Your mom also sucks.", "NTA. You worked out a substitute, and your daughter understands. It\u2019s odd the adult (your ex) is more angry than the child. It was petty of Lisa to bring your mom into this. Ignore those two.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke with your daughter, and she understood, this was a mini recital and not the main event. Your (step) son was the lead roll in his final play. This was a major event, and I am sure he was thrilled that you were there. Enjoy your ice cream with your daughter.", "NTA. It makes sense - if you've attended everyone's events up to now - to prioritize the one that occurs only 4 times a year over one that occurs monthly (as long as it wasn't the \"big\" recital).\n\nEDIT: and your son is your son. Ignore your ex who says otherwise.", "NTA. you didn't promise either of them and I think your ex was the AH here tbh", "NTA. You told your daughter beforehand and got someone to record it so you can watch it with her later so it's obviously just a case of bad timings to me.", "NTA. Your daughter gave you the go ahead, that is the only vote that mattered.", "NTA \n\nI think you did the most logical thing.

You have a great track record with attending. You're also making sure it's recorded and will watch it with her later.

It was just one of the monthly mini recitals as opposed to the last play he will be in where he is the star, and he only has 4 a year.", "I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong here, I don\u2019t have much time to go into depth but long story short is it was his huge play and his very last one before college so it means a lot to him, she had a mini recital which sure it\u2019s a big deal but it wasn\u2019t the big giant show the means the world to her. Plus she was understanding and you did say you would make it up to her.", "NTA\n\n\nYou were honest to carmen and you had to make a decision.", "NTA, if I were you, I would have chosen Luke's play as well.
