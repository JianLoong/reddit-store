Firstly, your friend should not have spent $100 on drugs. Secondly, your friend should not have spent money that was meant for a birthday gift.

That\u2019s your offer. He took X which means he also has the condition of Y. He cannot say \u201cI will take X but I\u2019m not accepting the condition of Y. The process of accepting X means he gets the condition of Y too so if that was your offer he cannot just refuse to accept the condition. For example, if you get a mortgage from a bank you borrow X and have the condition Y that if you fail to pay back X the bank will take possession of your home. You cannot tell the bank I do not accept that condition and then proceed to take the mortgage.
