He did what a nice person should do.", "True friends also pay back a loan in the time promised, so I guess it checks out in the end", "ESH\n\nThat is a controversial answer but it came after heavy deliberation. Firstly, your friend should not have spent $100 on drugs. Secondly, your friend should not have spent money that was meant for a birthday gift. Thirdly, your friend should not borrow money and not pay it back. Fourth, paying money back is expected so your friend should not act like it is a favour. There\u2019s more that can be said but it is obvious your friend is an arsehole for the second point.\n\nHowever, lending money to him made you the arsehole but I do agree with your understanding of the deal and not your friends. You lent him $100 on the condition that if he did not pay back the $100 in a week you would tell his girlfriend why he needed to borrow the money. \n\nIf you break down the logic it\u2019s you can have X with the condition of Y. That\u2019s your offer. He took X which means he also has the condition of Y. He cannot say \u201cI will take X but I\u2019m not accepting the condition of Y. The process of accepting X means he gets the condition of Y too so if that was your offer he cannot just refuse to accept the condition. For example, if you get a mortgage from a bank you borrow X and have the condition Y that if you fail to pay back X the bank will take possession of your home. You cannot tell the bank I do not accept that condition and then proceed to take the mortgage. The condition was stated and his conditions were not explicitly agreed to so he should not have worked under his deal he tacitly thought you agreed too.\n\nYou\u2019re the arsehole for lending money to someone who you called \u201cfinancially hopeless\u201d and say \u201cnever pays money back on time.\u201d Why would you lend money to your friend. In another comment you said you lent money because you were guilt tripped and just wanted him to stop asking. You knew it was very likely you would not be paid back, in a week no less, then you should not have lent to money as you\u2019re going to have to make a choice on following through. \n\nIf it was a given you would not have been paid back, lending the money and following through means you were getting directly involved in a relationship, which you have likely ruined, when you did not need to do. \n\nSo ESH but you may have lost a \u2018friend\u2019 that you didn\u2019t really need.", "Your friend sucks. NTA", "NTA, but he legit told you he already didn't agree with your terms, yet you continued.", "\u201cLook at it this way: It costs you 20 dollars to get rid of him... He's out of your life for 20 dollars. You got off cheap. Forget him.\u201d - Chaz Palminteri \nNTA", "Fuck I wish I could just borrow from a bank and not accept the terms about paying it back.\n\nAll jokes aside though, you really shouldn't have let him take the money if he wasn't ready to agree to what you set out.

Also it's kind of you to warn her about the type of guy she's with\n\nHonestly I'd drop him as a friend.

Pretext a lie to the gf saying there was a problem with her gift but she'll get it next week.", "You knew this guy wouldn't pay you back. yours", "I disagree. If it was my girlfriend,  I would 100% borrow money for a week rather than let her down on her birthday.\nI would transfer that money straight back ASAP, and I wouldn't have \"accidently\" bought drugs either.\n\nOPs friend shouldn't have had to borrow it and should have been a better person, but the point of borrowing money for a week makes sense.\n\n(Of course, adding if the gift was readily available or formed part of a trip/ event, a lie wouldn't make sense or be believable.)"]}
