Firstly, your friend should not have spent $100 on drugs. Secondly, your friend should not have spent money that was meant for a birthday gift.

That\u2019s your offer. He took X which means he also has the condition of Y. He cannot say \u201cI will take X but I\u2019m not accepting the condition of Y. The process of accepting X means he gets the condition of Y too so if that was your offer he cannot just refuse to accept the condition. For example, if you get a mortgage from a bank you borrow X and have the condition Y that if you fail to pay back X the bank will take possession of your home. You cannot tell the bank I do not accept that condition and then proceed to take the mortgage.

This guy is crap. He's a user, a liar and a bum. Blaming you for his relationship woes is stupid.

If he didn't accept the terms he shouldn't have borrowed the money. Either way, it seems his plan was never to pay you back.

A good idea that you don't even remember having the next day. Plus the fact that where I'm from it is so easy to get hold of.
