You are only spying on your side of the room.  \n\nGood luck with him calling the police as he will have to explain he doesn't want you  to be able to catch him stealing from you!!!", "NTA. Your brother is stealing your money. You haven't done anything wrong. If anything, keep the footage of him stealing your money because this is just unacceptable behaviour. Since he is threatening the cops on you, you can threaten the cops on him too. \n\nAnd no, you have a right to film in your own home so that report won't go anywhere.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell him if HE calls the police, you will show them evidence of his theft and report him and have him prosecuted.", "NTA, he is going to have fun arguing\n\nHim: well there are cameras in my bedroom, can you do something about this.\n\nPolice: okay do you own rent or stay with family?\n\nHim: I live with my parents.\n\nPolice:....... and your parents know about them?\n\nHim: well yeah my brother put them up after someone stole 500 dollars out of the room we both share.\n\nPolice: maybe we need to talk to them then.....", "Info: do you know what a bank is?", "Tell him if he calls the police on you, you will show the police the video of him stealing your money and press charges.

This being a shared space you could be on shakey grounds legally but that's something for lawyers to figure out.
