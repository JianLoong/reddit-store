Instead, he's using words that she doesn't want to hear, and she feels he must know this, therefore, since he insists on not using the proper words and accepting responsibility for her feelings, he must be trying to hurt her intentionally and should apologize for that now, too. \n\nFWIW, I'm a woman and I remember my getting upset about shit like this when I were was young.
