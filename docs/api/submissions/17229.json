They are now divorced. \n\nI really don't comprehend this separate finances thing, at all. You're sharing your life with someone, literally sharing your last name, potentially sharing genetics when you have kids.. why would it be considered *sharing* the money you both bring in to go towards your SHARED bills and finances?? Why would you not trust your partner with that? When you're literally paying into the same things and have the same financial stake in everything?? I would be totally offended if a partner suggested this to me (a hypothetical, potential long-term partner, bc I'm married to someone who would never suggest such a thing), and I would honestly end the relationship over it. You don't trust and love me enough to pool our finances and not play tit-for-tat with every dollar that's spent? We don't need to be together, then. I can see why so many couples' biggest issue is finances, if so many people have split accounts that they consider \"mine\" and \"yours.\" It honestly blows my mind.", "I think you should do half and half.

People tend to separate finances when the positions are unequal *at the start*. Separation circumvents a lot of the issues that arise when trying to blend positions that aren't super compatible.\n\nRather than a difference in wealth, the more likely incompatibility will also tend to be in terms of financial *priorities*.\n\nSay, for example, you're going into a second marriage and you both have kids from previous relationships. Maybe one parent believes a good education is so important that they shell out tens of grand per year to send their kids to private school. The other parent in contrast might be happy with the public schools around them and chooses to pay for their kids to do enriching hobbies like yachting or horseriding.\n\nWith separate finances, such a scenario is a nothing burger. You live together, you enjoy each other's company, and you continue to invest in your kids as each of you see fit.\n\nFor someone insisting on perfect blending and financial equality on the other hand, the debate becomes withdrawing kids from school versus selling your daughter's horse. Or it could get way messier than that. If the second parent has three extra kids, maybe the couple can't even afford private schooling for everyone combined. So what do they do? Do you still make parent two take on half the cost for a school their own kids aren't going to, whose tuition even exceeds all of their kids combined? Do you send everyone to public school on principle? Or some middle-ground, less expensive private school for all?", "Separate accounts would be my hill.

This was way before debit cards even existed. We still refer to then as the joint and household accounts. My wife was responsible for balancing the household account and we always kept a floor in it of at least a couple of hundred dollars. Come payday, the account would get an infusion of what a typical month'/s expenses plus her discretionary money. The point was that she always knew how much was in the account and could write a check based on that knowledge. Keep in mind that the bank sent a monthly statement and overdraft notices days after the event. \n\nIt was never my money and her money, but simply a tool that let her be able to make spending decisions without worrying that I would do something that would drain the account and leave the household account in a bad spot or vice versa.", "In my job I have to deal with a lot of men whose wives did a lot of the paperwork for the job and now that their wife is gone they don't know how to do it.

I paid all the bills and managed the finances, and when I wanted something (like a pair of shoes or something) I just bought it. But she never felt comfortable doing that. She felt like it was my money, not our money. I never understood the hang up, but she ended up going back to work and opening her own account. I still pay all the bills, and her money is just for her. It makes her feel secure. It makes her feel like an adult. I think she lost a lot of herself being a SAHM for 20 years.

We pay our own bills (subscriptions, phone etc) and we divide the household bills, I cover medicals, insurance, and kids.

Because if someone called me an incel for anything other than not getting laid I'd just think they were a moron that, and as such, their opinion would be irrelevant to me.

So we bought soft dog food. We figured he was 16, he probably deserved to be pampered at this point. He LOVED that! \u2026for 4 months. Just when we had bought an entire box of the cans he liked, he decided he didn\u2019t want canned dog food either. But he would cry and beg at your side so we knew he was hungry! We tried everything to tempt him back to canned food: a sprinkle of cheese on top, adding a bite of ground beef or chicken stock\u2026 nope. Finally we got so worried about him my dad fried him an egg, and he wolfed it down. We thought \u201cok! He\u2019s getting his appetite back!\u201d But once he tasted that egg and knew we would cave for him, it was game over. He got a bowl of rice and veggies with eggs or meat or salmon twice a day, every day for the rest of his life.
