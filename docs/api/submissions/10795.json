This is so incredibly rude because it\u2019s his home too and puts the responsibility on HIM to always remember and make it a habit. You\u2019re making it his problem when it\u2019s a YOU problem. \n\nInstead why don\u2019t you make it a habit to text him / call him whenever his usual shift ends to find out if he\u2019s coming home right away or getting off late.\n\nIf you love alone time that much consider splitting households and having sleepovers / visiting each other instead.", "YTA. You're asking him to warn you when he is coming to his own home because you would really prefer if he would just stay at work. How do you think that would make him feel.", "YTA, I guess.\n\nThis is weird, and even I, a fellow introvert, does not understand this.\n\nWhy are you living together if you're blissed out when alone? Are you not in bliss when you're together?  Sit with that.\n\nMaybe you should get your own place if you crave your solitude more than living in a house together.", "YTA\n\nHe lives there with you. it's not like it's your place and he's turning up unannounced sometimes. You literally both live there and should not have to pre-announce to each other that you might walk through the door an hour earlier than you normally would.", "Listen. You **NEED** to tell me when you are coming home, because *honestly* I am happier when you are not here. So from now on you **MUST** tell me when you are coming home to ruin everything.", "I am the same as you, enjoy my \u2018me\u2019 time, and understand it\u2019s not the same as having someone in the house. However I\u2019d feel pretty crummy if my partner asked me to text before I was to come home everyday. It would make me feel unwelcome, and also probably make me a little insecure as to why you needed the heads up every time (think more into it / that you were trying to hide something).\nI think it\u2019s asking too much of your partner.", "Honestly YTA\n\nNot for asking, but for not taking the \u201cNO\u201d as an answer. He is coming back home. He does not need to communicate promptly every time he leaves his workplace.", "I guess it\u2019s easy for him to do but at the same time it comes across as incredibly insulting due to your reasoning.", "YTA soft. I mean... It can go both ways. He shouldn't have to report to you like your his mom making sure he makes curfew. He's a grown adult. Also... It kinda makes you look suspicious that you need to know exactly when he's coming home... As if you want to make sure he doesn't walk in on something. If a person feels the need to be that controlling, they have apps on cellphones to tell when someone is traveling and what direction they're going in. However... An occasional heads up is nice, but to demand it is wrong.", "YTA, like other people said it's his house too so he shouldn't have to announce himself coming home.\n\nAlso it might just be me but if my partner asked me to tell them I'm coming back earlier than the exact time they expect me back, I'd think they might have something to hide. It just seems a bit weird and suspicious to me.", "YTA. You both live there. He just wants to come home early occasionally. Unless you\u2019re cheating and need to get your AP out of the house before your partner gets home OR you work from home and need to know about extraneous noise, then you better stick to your guns.", "YTA\n\nYour partner does not have to tell you when they are coming back to the place they live.", "Yta. Move out. He can home when ever he wants you aren't his mom. If you have so much fun without him just break up with him.", "Huge, massive YTA. It\u2019s his home, he\u2019ll get back to it whenever he wants to, what is wrong with you", "If I was being asked to do this, I wouldn't. If it's my house too I'm not going to feel obligated to announce when I'm coming home from work. YTA.", "YTA- \n\nGee, is he allowed a key?", "YTA\n\nI'm also an introvert who loves their alone time, but if I needed it THAT bad, I wouldn't have gotten into a relationship or moved in with my partner. \n\nNo matter how you say it, you are coming across as not wanting to be around them or needing to prepare yourself for their presence, and that's not a good feeling.", "NAH but leaning towards YTA depending on how you handle it. You can ask but if he doesn't text, you need to find your own way of dealing with your solitude ending.\n\n  \nHe lives there too and should be able to come and go as he pleases and not feel like an intruder in his own home. It's not like he is practising the drums at 4 in the morning or doing something inconveniencing. He's simply coming home from work - likely happy to see you, happy to not work late and looking forward to a relaxing evening at home. \n\n  \nYou decided to live together, and that means that there's another person living with you. If you want people to schedule visits and have people text you when they come to your place, you have to live alone.", "YTA, you both live there. It's fine to ask him to do it, but he has no obligation to let you know he's coming to his home.", "Yta.  If you are bothered by your partner simply coming home earlier than expected, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t even be in a relationship.  You\u2019d rather Ben alone than with him.  You are bothered by how he likes lights to be on.  You don\u2019t want to have to talk to him.  You aren\u2019t a very good partner imo.  Your partner shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells around you.", "YTA\n\nHe does not need your permission to return to his own home after work.", "YTA for all the reasons already said.  To me it looks like you have a choice to make: \n\n1. Just assume everyday he works could be a short one and only plan for \u201cyou time\u201d for that shortened period of time. \n\n2. Accept the fact that your private time will need to be restricted to the bedroom if he returns early. \n\n3. If he agrees, switch it so that he stays in the bedroom so you can stay out in the lounge area. \n\n4. Move into a bigger space so you can have a dedicated room, your very own safe space. \n\n5. Live in separate homes so you can choose to live together. \n\n6. Keep things exactly as they are until he decides to break up with you because he thinks you\u2019re either rude or cheating.", "NTA. My wife and I always text when we're on our way home. It's such a little courtesy to do and it prevents the other person at home from being completely startled when the front door opens and the cat starts losing his mind. We also don't take it personally when we each need alone time, like apparently everyone here commenting Y T A does, lol.", "Fellow introvert here. I feel you, some people need time for themselves sometimes, and while you do love your partner coming home, some days him coming home will cut short on your me time unexpectedly. I absolutely get that this irks you, and I absolutely understand that it's not the same if he's home (even if he's not really disturbing you in any way).\n\nAn understanding partner should know you well enough to know you need \"me time\", but in this case, if you're the AH or not really depends on how you discussed this with him. You need to make sure that he knows while you're looking forward to him coming home, you're also enjoying your time alone, and him cutting that short **unexpectedly** is kind of a disruption of that. He needs to know that this is not about him coming home earlier or not and you're not trying to keep him out of the house. It's about him letting you know so you know you're alone time will be cut short.  \nAs soon as anything you say makes him feel unwelcome in his own home, you're the AH.\n\nIt's hard to give a verdict because I wasn't there when you had that conversation, but since he appears to be upset about it, it appears something went wrong in the communication and YTA.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Y-T-As.  Don\u2019t any of you check in with your partners when you\u2019re coming home?\n\nMy husband and I both work odd hours.  The first thing we do when we finish our day is text each other.  \u201cHeaded home - need anything from out in the world?\u201d kind of thing.  Or \u201cgot off early - yay!\u201d  Or \u201cmight go past 10p - want me to text when I\u2019m leaving?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t understand why this is such a huge ask?  NTA from me.", "YTA\n\nwhile I understand the need for solitude to recharge. You decided to live together. As such you both have the same amount of right to the place. By agreeing to move in together, you accepted that you won't always have your solitude. Sure you can ask him to let you know, but you can't be mad for him not doing/forgetting it when he may have had a long day at work.", "YTA.  Why live with someone if you need an alert they\u2019re coming home. Live by yourself.", "I would say YTA but only because you\u2019re expecting this every time he is done with work. If you had a once or twice a month request for space or personal time as a spa day, for example, I\u2019d have a bit more empathy. \n\nNote that I\u2019m saying _empathy_ rather than _sympathy_. I find it\u2019s easier for me to have better self-care and routine when I\u2019m alone than when my partner is around. However, that\u2019s because I have codependency issues and major depressive disorder. I automatically fall into their habits and it\u2019s hard for me to be me. \n\nYou may have underlying issues here, maybe with yourself or with him or even both. Hell, or neither and you\u2019re just fussy. You know better than I do, as I only have this post to go upon. As written, my judgement stands. Seems like you just want some spa hours and it outweighs your joy of their return.", "YTA \n\nWeather you have a warning text that I be home at this time or not. Your requests doesn't validate your demand for timing. Why why will his estimated time of arrival change any fact that your already enjoying your moment of solitude without interruption. Til he walk thru the door. Then times up. He already gives you permission to just continue on as you doing.\n\nIf you just chill and enjoy the time uninterrupted til he comes home. Its over. Tomorrow another day. Repeat solitude time.", "YTA. It's both of yours' home, he shouldn't have to give you notice that he is coming to his (and your) home. It sounds like you could adjust your thinking and plan to expect him home earlier than scheduled.", "NTA in principle but you need to work on communication.\n\nI totally get the wanting own space thing, I'm pretty sociable person but I'm a teacher and sometimes am just completely drained. Me and my partner have had to agree that he doesn't take random work from home during holidays, because it just disrupted my ability to relax and recharge.\n\nHowever, I think its all about how you communicate these things. If either of us needs some alone time to decompress from work etc we say that directly with a time frame \"I.e. I just need an hour, at 6.00 let's start making dinner together and watch TV\" etc. It's always communicated that we love each other, just need a little personal time so we can enjoy the rest of the evening together not stressed.\n\n> he says he \"shouldn't be in trouble\" for this, and its \"no big deal\"\n\nThis suggests you probably haven't communicated properly, or have maybe been unfairly negative in your response to him returning early. I would feel pretty hurt if my partners response was immediately I should have texted.", "INFO.some context so you can understand my question. So I like to be alone. My husband is a delivery driver and we live on his bid route.  When he first got it he would pop in at his lunch,  never a routine time,  and scare the bejeezus out of me. He walks on kitten feet, and I'd be in the kitchen watching a show and doing the dishes or whatever and he'd walk up behind me and say hi or kiss my neck and I'd almost cut a finger off or something. I had a talk with him about my anxiety and he got it. Now he texts me when he's on his way home for lunch so I know to expect him anywhere between 5 minutes to half an hour.  He gets home when hes done, and its usually between 6 and 8pm, so I can usually prepare myself for that in my mind. How early is he getting home?  If it's like an hour or two can you just say \"oh it's 3pm my guy could be home anytime in the next couple hours so I should be prepared for that mentally\"?", "If your husband works I'm going to assume it's 8 hours a day so you've already had at least 8 hours of \"alone\" time much more do you need?.", "I don't know if it's gonna be an unpopular opinion but \n\nNAH. \n\nYou can discuss it with him politely and tell him that it's your \"me time\" and you like having that solitude and you would want to know when he comes so that you can prepare yourself mentally with it.\n\nNot a huge thing to ask at all.  \n\nHe isn't wrong too because he is your partner and it's his house too and he would want you to be comfortable with him being there or not. So he doesn't think it as a big deal which is again acceptable. \n\n However if it makes you happy .. let him know it would mean a lot and maybe that may help him understand it better i guess ?\n\nSome things that appear \"meh\" or \"not a big deal\" could be a big deal to someone else. It's just a matter of perspective. \n\nAlso... It may happen that he won't be able to adhere to it always because sometimes he may forget to text and just come up ..so it's a middle ground that you both have to reach.", "YTA. It\u2019s so odd having to announce when you\u2019re going back to your own place. It\u2019s his house as much as it is yours. He should be allowed to come and go without announcing it", "NAH. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. For some of us, going from solitude to being around other people is jarring without a warning or transitional period. I\u2019ve asked my husband to give me an adjustment period when he gets home before he starts trying to have a conversation with me. The way I put it is \u201cIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re you, it\u2019s just because you\u2019re a person.\u201d\n\nSome people here think you might\u2019ve hurt his feelings, which is possible, but if he knows you well I\u2019m sure he\u2019s aware of the fact that you like your solitude and isn\u2019t taking this personally. It would be good to check though and clarify that it\u2019s not because there\u2019s anything wrong with him.\n\nAnother solution to this would be for you to both download a tracking app such as Life 360 that let\u2019s you know the other\u2019s location. You can set different locations such as home and work and get an alert when someone arrives or leaves. That way he can avoid the hassle of texting you. It\u2019s really useful for safety reasons as well.", "NTA, i don\u2019t get all the Y T As. You\u2019re just asking for a heads up that your routine will be disrupted. It\u2019s not an everyday demand or that you can\u2019t stand him like a lot of ppl are claiming. It\u2019s also not asking for much.\n\nPartnerships are all about doing lil things to make your fav person happy. I\u2019m not an introvert but i\u2019d be happy to (and already do!) shoot a heads up text to make sure someone i care about is comfortable! It\u2019s basically the same as notifying your partner that you\u2019ll be home late lol. \n\nI do agree with some of the suggestions here to revisit it and make sure it didn\u2019t come across too harsh, or validate him if he needs, and maybe an automatic text system could work.", "Nta. My partner usually texts me updates when he's coming home if he's been at work (one day a week in another city - usually wfh), or at a friend's house. I've never asked him to do this, though I actually really love that he does this of his own accord! I think it's sweet, and I usually text him if I'm leaving work or uni early. Idk, it just allows us the opportunity to say we miss/can't wait to see each other or remind/ask each other to pick something up on the way home for dinner etc. Also to congratulate each other finishing work early.", "NTA. People honestly have no idea what freedom is found when you are an introvert and you are home alone. It is truly blissful and for those people who don\u2019t get it, they will make you feel like an asshole. There is nothing more jarring then when you are sitting at home enjoying your time alone for once doing whatever you want to do and then someone just shows up ahead of the planned time you thought they would be there. \n\nOf course you know they live there. It\u2019s just in your mind you had additional time. \n\nI get it, you aren\u2019t saying don\u2019t come home or don\u2019t leave early, just give you a heads up. Sometimes you need that time to mentally shift. It\u2019s not a hard ask and it\u2019s not a hard request to follow.", "NTA, if they are leaving early it's not that big hustle to to write: I finished early, I'm on my way home. Or if it is too much for them you can use tracking app on their phone with automatic notification that  they have left their workplace. I have it for my kid to know they arrived to music school on time and that they left and are on their way home.", "NTA. I absolutely agree with you. I like my solitude. And my social anxiety means I need to mentally prepare for social interaction.

I'm also an introvert like you and I NEED my alone time. It isn't negotiable. However, this is your partners home too and they don't have to alert you every time they are going to *their* home. \n\nI'd recommend asking your partner if they can send you a copy of their schedule whenever they get it so you can plan accordingly and properly schedule your alone time. \n\nMy husband and I started doing that a few years back, and it's been fantastic - we communicate our schedules every week and I plan for a time where I can be alone and do my own thing.

I'd side with you if I thought you genuinely wanted to be adorable about your relationship", "> its about the warning aha!\n\nDo you see the language you naturally gravitate towards here? You want him to \"warn\" you that he's coming home. Not letting you know, but a warning of the unwanted thing.", "It's not unreasonable at all.", "People should take responsibility for their reactions.  OP didn\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d him feel anything.  Sounds like he should fix his ignorance about introverts", "Everybody in my family shares our location with each other. My sister, boyfriend, parents, some of my friends too. If you and him are both comfortable with it you should do it.", "OP it will also alert you when he is leaving work which is exactly what you want", "i will", "Tbh, even with this updated method, if it was frequent enough, I\u2019d still end up feeling a little unwelcome.", "this is an excellent point. maybe I could text him when i am needing some me time, and ask to let me know if he leaves early. that means its on me and not him! i love it!", "i really appreciate this perspective, because its often hard to articulate \ud83e\udd70 but u nailed it!", "hmm. i actually didn't pick that up at all. i cant recall if i said that to him dirwectly or just here on reddit. if i said it to him, that would be bad.", "He is going to his HOME, he isn't surprising them at their job, he had the right to not warn anyone before coming to the place he lives. Introverts also need to mitigate their own reactions and take responsibility.", "Yes people should take accountability for their ACTIONS. But you can't tell people how to feel. Emotions are a natural response we can't control. What we can control is how we act on those feelings.  She never said he yelled or did anything he'd needed to take responsibility for. So what exactly are you saying?", "This is actually great. For some reason, my kids now think they should parent me and like to know where I'm at. I humor them, but I forget it's on, and I'll get a random message asking for something from a store I'm at. It confused me until I realized they checked my location.", "Yeah, you're still not getting it. The bottom line is that he doesn't need and shouldn't have to have permission to return to his own home EVER. If you can't handle that, then you need to get your own place.", "Make sure to ask him to knock on the door and wait for you to answer as well", "Words are hard lol - I look forward to updates from you. You can definitely make it work if you put in the work. When you have this talk with him, try to use \u201cI\u201d statements rather than \u201cyou\u201d statements. It sounds less like an accusation and more like something you want to improve for the sake of your relationship and quality of life. \n\nFor example, \u201cI find it hard to find balance in what I do when we are both home, so alone time every so often helps me reset\u201d rather than \u201cwhen you come home without warning, it messes up my day,\u201d takes the blame off of his actions and creates a blameless environment where the source of your stress is where it belongs - in your head as a manifestation of anxiety and uncertain boundaries. Those thoughts are real, and the things happening in your head matter. It\u2019s simply making sure we don\u2019t blame people for things they\u2019re not actually doing \u201cwrong,\u201d and focusing on possible solutions to the real problems.", "> i cant recall if i said that to him dirwectly or just here on reddit. if i said it to him, that would be bad.\n\nIt's not just whether or not you say it to his face - it's representative of your internal attitude.", "No he should wait in his car til his girlfriend comes down and opens the car door to show she is ready to see him now", "i went and spoke with him and gave him a hug and said \"im sorry, i didnt mean to be like that or make you feel like u weren't welcome home, i just realised it had been a while since i had some quiet time and i really needed it today.\" and it was really lovely. then he proceeded to talk my ear off about other happy things. so i think we're all good ahahha.\n\ni think i might acknowledge maybe he can't do what i ask... for whatever reason, busyness, forgetfulness, etc. im going to make the effort to let him know when im needing \"me space\" and i will ask HIM if he's coming home early so i can adjust.", "Ah yes quite right, my mistake", "That\u2019s wonderful news about you two having a chat, and I think it\u2019s a great idea to be proactive next time. Letting him know you just need a bit of self care time is being transparent with your needs and 100% justifiable without being insulting, which is exactly what should happen in relationships. Kudos on your progress!"]}
