This is so incredibly rude because it\u2019s his home too and puts the responsibility on HIM to always remember and make it a habit. You\u2019re making it his problem when it\u2019s a YOU problem. \n\nInstead why don\u2019t you make it a habit to text him / call him whenever his usual shift ends to find out if he\u2019s coming home right away or getting off late.\n\nIf you love alone time that much consider splitting households and having sleepovers / visiting each other instead.", "YTA. You're asking him to warn you when he is coming to his own home because you would really prefer if he would just stay at work. How do you think that would make him feel.", "YTA, I guess.\n\nThis is weird, and even I, a fellow introvert, does not understand this.\n\nWhy are you living together if you're blissed out when alone? Are you not in bliss when you're together?  Sit with that.\n\nMaybe you should get your own place if you crave your solitude more than living in a house together.", "YTA\n\nHe lives there with you. it's not like it's your place and he's turning up unannounced sometimes. You literally both live there and should not have to pre-announce to each other that you might walk through the door an hour earlier than you normally would.", "Listen. You **NEED** to tell me when you are coming home, because *honestly* I am happier when you are not here. So from now on you **MUST** tell me when you are coming home to ruin everything.", "I am the same as you, enjoy my \u2018me\u2019 time, and understand it\u2019s not the same as having someone in the house. However I\u2019d feel pretty crummy if my partner asked me to text before I was to come home everyday. It would make me feel unwelcome, and also probably make me a little insecure as to why you needed the heads up every time (think more into it / that you were trying to hide something).\nI think it\u2019s asking too much of your partner.", "Honestly YTA\n\nNot for asking, but for not taking the \u201cNO\u201d as an answer. He is coming back home. He does not need to communicate promptly every time he leaves his workplace.", "I guess it\u2019s easy for him to do but at the same time it comes across as incredibly insulting due to your reasoning.", "YTA soft. I mean... It can go both ways. He shouldn't have to report to you like your his mom making sure he makes curfew. He's a grown adult. Also... It kinda makes you look suspicious that you need to know exactly when he's coming home... As if you want to make sure he doesn't walk in on something. If a person feels the need to be that controlling, they have apps on cellphones to tell when someone is traveling and what direction they're going in. However... An occasional heads up is nice, but to demand it is wrong.", "YTA, like other people said it's his house too so he shouldn't have to announce himself coming home.\n\nAlso it might just be me but if my partner asked me to tell them I'm coming back earlier than the exact time they expect me back, I'd think they might have something to hide. It just seems a bit weird and suspicious to me.", "YTA. You both live there. He just wants to come home early occasionally. Unless you\u2019re cheating and need to get your AP out of the house before your partner gets home OR you work from home and need to know about extraneous noise, then you better stick to your guns.", "YTA\n\nYour partner does not have to tell you when they are coming back to the place they live.", "Yta. Move out. He can home when ever he wants you aren't his mom. If you have so much fun without him just break up with him.", "Huge, massive YTA. It\u2019s his home, he\u2019ll get back to it whenever he wants to, what is wrong with you", "If I was being asked to do this, I wouldn't. If it's my house too I'm not going to feel obligated to announce when I'm coming home from work. YTA.", "YTA- \n\nGee, is he allowed a key?", "YTA\n\nI'm also an introvert who loves their alone time, but if I needed it THAT bad, I wouldn't have gotten into a relationship or moved in with my partner. \n\nNo matter how you say it, you are coming across as not wanting to be around them or needing to prepare yourself for their presence, and that's not a good feeling.", "NAH but leaning towards YTA depending on how you handle it. You can ask but if he doesn't text, you need to find your own way of dealing with your solitude ending.\n\n  \nHe lives there too and should be able to come and go as he pleases and not feel like an intruder in his own home. It's not like he is practising the drums at 4 in the morning or doing something inconveniencing. He's simply coming home from work - likely happy to see you, happy to not work late and looking forward to a relaxing evening at home. \n\n  \nYou decided to live together, and that means that there's another person living with you. If you want people to schedule visits and have people text you when they come to your place, you have to live alone.", "YTA, you both live there. It's fine to ask him to do it, but he has no obligation to let you know he's coming to his home.", "Yta.  If you are bothered by your partner simply coming home earlier than expected, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t even be in a relationship.  You\u2019d rather Ben alone than with him.  You are bothered by how he likes lights to be on.  You don\u2019t want to have to talk to him.  You aren\u2019t a very good partner imo.  Your partner shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells around you.", "YTA\n\nHe does not need your permission to return to his own home after work.", "YTA for all the reasons already said.  To me it looks like you have a choice to make: \n\n1. Just assume everyday he works could be a short one and only plan for \u201cyou time\u201d for that shortened period of time. \n\n2. Accept the fact that your private time will need to be restricted to the bedroom if he returns early. \n\n3. If he agrees, switch it so that he stays in the bedroom so you can stay out in the lounge area. \n\n4. Move into a bigger space so you can have a dedicated room, your very own safe space. \n\n5. Live in separate homes so you can choose to live together. \n\n6. Keep things exactly as they are until he decides to break up with you because he thinks you\u2019re either rude or cheating.", "NTA. My wife and I always text when we're on our way home. It's such a little courtesy to do and it prevents the other person at home from being completely startled when the front door opens and the cat starts losing his mind. We also don't take it personally when we each need alone time, like apparently everyone here commenting Y T A does, lol.", "Fellow introvert here. I feel you, some people need time for themselves sometimes, and while you do love your partner coming home, some days him coming home will cut short on your me time unexpectedly. I absolutely get that this irks you, and I absolutely understand that it's not the same if he's home (even if he's not really disturbing you in any way).\n\nAn understanding partner should know you well enough to know you need \"me time\", but in this case, if you're the AH or not really depends on how you discussed this with him. You need to make sure that he knows while you're looking forward to him coming home, you're also enjoying your time alone, and him cutting that short **unexpectedly** is kind of a disruption of that. He needs to know that this is not about him coming home earlier or not and you're not trying to keep him out of the house. It's about him letting you know so you know you're alone time will be cut short.  \nAs soon as anything you say makes him feel unwelcome in his own home, you're the AH.\n\nIt's hard to give a verdict because I wasn't there when you had that conversation, but since he appears to be upset about it, it appears something went wrong in the communication and YTA.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Y-T-As.  Don\u2019t any of you check in with your partners when you\u2019re coming home?\n\nMy husband and I both work odd hours.  The first thing we do when we finish our day is text each other.  \u201cHeaded home - need anything from out in the world?\u201d kind of thing.  Or \u201cgot off early - yay!\u201d  Or \u201cmight go past 10p - want me to text when I\u2019m leaving?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t understand why this is such a huge ask?  NTA from me.", "YTA\n\nwhile I understand the need for solitude to recharge. You decided to live together. As such you both have the same amount of right to the place. By agreeing to move in together, you accepted that you won't always have your solitude. Sure you can ask him to let you know, but you can't be mad for him not doing/forgetting it when he may have had a long day at work.", "YTA.  Why live with someone if you need an alert they\u2019re coming home. Live by yourself.", "I would say YTA but only because you\u2019re expecting this every time he is done with work. If you had a once or twice a month request for space or personal time as a spa day, for example, I\u2019d have a bit more empathy. \n\nNote that I\u2019m saying _empathy_ rather than _sympathy_. I find it\u2019s easier for me to have better self-care and routine when I\u2019m alone than when my partner is around. However, that\u2019s because I have codependency issues and major depressive disorder. I automatically fall into their habits and it\u2019s hard for me to be me. \n\nYou may have underlying issues here, maybe with yourself or with him or even both. Hell, or neither and you\u2019re just fussy. You know better than I do, as I only have this post to go upon. As written, my judgement stands. Seems like you just want some spa hours and it outweighs your joy of their return.", "YTA \n\nWeather you have a warning text that I be home at this time or not. Your requests doesn't validate your demand for timing. Why why will his estimated time of arrival change any fact that your already enjoying your moment of solitude without interruption. Til he walk thru the door. Then times up. He already gives you permission to just continue on as you doing.\n\nIf you just chill and enjoy the time uninterrupted til he comes home. Its over. Tomorrow another day. Repeat solitude time.", "YTA. It's both of yours' home, he shouldn't have to give you notice that he is coming to his (and your) home. It sounds like you could adjust your thinking and plan to expect him home earlier than scheduled.", "NTA in principle but you need to work on communication.\n\nI totally get the wanting own space thing, I'm pretty sociable person but I'm a teacher and sometimes am just completely drained. Me and my partner have had to agree that he doesn't take random work from home during holidays, because it just disrupted my ability to relax and recharge.\n\nHowever, I think its all about how you communicate these things. If either of us needs some alone time to decompress from work etc we say that directly with a time frame \"I.e. I just need an hour, at 6.00 let's start making dinner together and watch TV\" etc. It's always communicated that we love each other, just need a little personal time so we can enjoy the rest of the evening together not stressed.\n\n> he says he \"shouldn't be in trouble\" for this, and its \"no big deal\"\n\nThis suggests you probably haven't communicated properly, or have maybe been unfairly negative in your response to him returning early. I would feel pretty hurt if my partners response was immediately I should have texted.", "INFO.some context so you can understand my question. So I like to be alone. My husband is a delivery driver and we live on his bid route.  When he first got it he would pop in at his lunch,  never a routine time,  and scare the bejeezus out of me. He walks on kitten feet, and I'd be in the kitchen watching a show and doing the dishes or whatever and he'd walk up behind me and say hi or kiss my neck and I'd almost cut a finger off or something. I had a talk with him about my anxiety and he got it. Now he texts me when he's on his way home for lunch so I know to expect him anywhere between 5 minutes to half an hour.  He gets home when hes done, and its usually between 6 and 8pm, so I can usually prepare myself for that in my mind. How early is he getting home?  If it's like an hour or two can you just say \"oh it's 3pm my guy could be home anytime in the next couple hours so I should be prepared for that mentally\"?", "If your husband works I'm going to assume it's 8 hours a day so you've already had at least 8 hours of \"alone\" time much more do you need?.", "I don't know if it's gonna be an unpopular opinion but \n\nNAH. \n\nYou can discuss it with him politely and tell him that it's your \"me time\" and you like having that solitude and you would want to know when he comes so that you can prepare yourself mentally with it.\n\nNot a huge thing to ask at all.  \n\nHe isn't wrong too because he is your partner and it's his house too and he would want you to be comfortable with him being there or not. So he doesn't think it as a big deal which is again acceptable. \n\n However if it makes you happy .. let him know it would mean a lot and maybe that may help him understand it better i guess ?\n\nSome things that appear \"meh\" or \"not a big deal\" could be a big deal to someone else. It's just a matter of perspective. \n\nAlso... It may happen that he won't be able to adhere to it always because sometimes he may forget to text and just come up ..so it's a middle ground that you both have to reach.", "YTA. It\u2019s so odd having to announce when you\u2019re going back to your own place. It\u2019s his house as much as it is yours. He should be allowed to come and go without announcing it", "NAH. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. For some of us, going from solitude to being around other people is jarring without a warning or transitional period. I\u2019ve asked my husband to give me an adjustment period when he gets home before he starts trying to have a conversation with me. The way I put it is \u201cIt\u2019s not because you\u2019re you, it\u2019s just because you\u2019re a person.\u201d\n\nSome people here think you might\u2019ve hurt his feelings, which is possible, but if he knows you well I\u2019m sure he\u2019s aware of the fact that you like your solitude and isn\u2019t taking this personally. It would be good to check though and clarify that it\u2019s not because there\u2019s anything wrong with him.\n\nAnother solution to this would be for you to both download a tracking app such as Life 360 that let\u2019s you know the other\u2019s location. You can set different locations such as home and work and get an alert when someone arrives or leaves. That way he can avoid the hassle of texting you. It\u2019s really useful for safety reasons as well.", "NTA, i don\u2019t get all the Y T As. You\u2019re just asking for a heads up that your routine will be disrupted. It\u2019s not an everyday demand or that you can\u2019t stand him like a lot of ppl are claiming. It\u2019s also not asking for much.\n\nPartnerships are all about doing lil things to make your fav person happy. I\u2019m not an introvert but i\u2019d be happy to (and already do!) shoot a heads up text to make sure someone i care about is comfortable! It\u2019s basically the same as notifying your partner that you\u2019ll be home late lol. \n\nI do agree with some of the suggestions here to revisit it and make sure it didn\u2019t come across too harsh, or validate him if he needs, and maybe an automatic text system could work.", "Nta. My partner usually texts me updates when he's coming home if he's been at work (one day a week in another city - usually wfh), or at a friend's house. I've never asked him to do this, though I actually really love that he does this of his own accord! I think it's sweet, and I usually text him if I'm leaving work or uni early. Idk, it just allows us the opportunity to say we miss/can't wait to see each other or remind/ask each other to pick something up on the way home for dinner etc. Also to congratulate each other finishing work early.", "NTA. People honestly have no idea what freedom is found when you are an introvert and you are home alone. It is truly blissful and for those people who don\u2019t get it, they will make you feel like an asshole. There is nothing more jarring then when you are sitting at home enjoying your time alone for once doing whatever you want to do and then someone just shows up ahead of the planned time you thought they would be there. \n\nOf course you know they live there. It\u2019s just in your mind you had additional time. \n\nI get it, you aren\u2019t saying don\u2019t come home or don\u2019t leave early, just give you a heads up. Sometimes you need that time to mentally shift. It\u2019s not a hard ask and it\u2019s not a hard request to follow.", "NTA, if they are leaving early it's not that big hustle to to write: I finished early, I'm on my way home. Or if it is too much for them you can use tracking app on their phone with automatic notification that  they have left their workplace. I have it for my kid to know they arrived to music school on time and that they left and are on their way home.", "NTA. I absolutely agree with you. I like my solitude.

I'm also an introvert like you and I NEED my alone time. It isn't negotiable. However, this is your partners home too and they don't have to alert you every time they are going to *their* home. \n\nI'd recommend asking your partner if they can send you a copy of their schedule whenever they get it so you can plan accordingly and properly schedule your alone time. \n\nMy husband and I started doing that a few years back, and it's been fantastic - we communicate our schedules every week and I plan for a time where I can be alone and do my own thing.

Being jarred out of flow state will make it harder to get into next time and can really mess with my functionality.  I have told my SO that I appreciate that he loves me in spite of such quirks,  and he always tells me that he loves me because of my quirks.

I thought that was common courtesy.\n\nETA: NTA", "Thank you! We always do this and until five minutes ago I thought everyone did. Isn\u2019t it polite to let others know what to expect? I mean we\u2019re both neurodivergent introverts so that could be part of it\u2026 and also we have annoying dogs so someone coming home is always disruptive especially if you are sleeping or trying to do a project that takes space and the dogs suddenly come merrily romping through excitedly because MOM IS HOME!!! But I think we\u2019d do it even without the dogs. It just seems like common courtesy to me.", "That sounds like a voluntary check in to me, though. Big difference between doing it because you want to and doing it because your partner has said they don\u2019t want you coming home unexpectedly. Personally I like to text my husband when I\u2019m setting off for safety (I want a record of when I set off), but if I didn\u2019t bother and came home at a random time and my husband was annoyed and asked why I hadn\u2019t let him know I was en route, I think it would feel quite different.", "Yeah the comments here are wild. No wonder so many people seem unhappy in their relationships if asking for a \"heads up, OMW home 3 hours early\" text causes DEFCON 1", "Just to add: my parents have been married for 30+ years and for the past however long mobile phones have been around for my dad has texted my mum every single day to let her know that he's on the 6:30 train home. It's only on like 1% of occasions that he's on a different train or his routine changes, but he still lets her know every single day because it's just common courtesy and it's not like it's a big burden for him. I don't understand why people are acting like this is an insane request.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But I do enjoy my rare alone time at home and even though my behavior doesn\u2019t actually change much when they\u2019re at home vs gone, it\u2019s a different head space. I like to know when I can expect solitude vs not, even though I\u2019m just as happy to have them home and don\u2019t like it when they\u2019re apart for long. You can both miss someone and enjoy being alone! And we always text when we will be home. Honestly I thought most people did\u2026.", "I totally agree! My husband and I are both introverts. We both agree that we work well together, because we are each the only person that the other could tolerate or be happy living with and being around long-term. Being together makes us happy, even when we are completely ignoring each other, and doing our own things.", "Right? My partner arriving takes my blood pressure down like 10 notches immediately.", "Exactly.  I love when my baby is home because he's MY home.", "Listen, I do understand. My husband drops in sometimes during the day when I am home. I sometimes feel checked up on, or my private time invaded. However I feel this is illogical, and I want my husband to feel like I always look forward to seeing him. So I ask him to call or text if he isn't going to be home on time.", "You live together. What\u2019s the \u201ccourtesy\u201d of telling your partner you\u2019re coming back to your house that you live in? \n\nWhat difference does it make anyways? He\u2019s coming home whether he tells you or not. You say you need \u201ca bit more me time,\u201d so.. do you intend on telling him he can\u2019t come home???", "Girl, I\u2019m with you. Hubs and I both text when we\u2019re heading home as a courtesy to the other, for the same reasons. NTA", "The novelist James Ellroy is apparently in a similar situation with an ex-wife - after the divorce they realised the problem was trying to live together, so now they have separate apartments in the same building.\n\nMy wife and I briefly separated after squeezing our lives from a two-bedroom apartment into a single large room in a sharehouse, and now we know that while we can live together, we need enough room to have our own space from time to time.\n\nPlus, these days, she snores so loudly that we can't sleep in the same bed, so we're (hopefully) about to buy a 4-bedroom place so we have a bedroom each, one for visitors (her parents live overseas), and one we can use as an office/library/hobby room.", "Um, this sounds amazing to me! I can\u2019t be the only one, right?!", "That is not marriage, more like FWB.", "I understand your side on this because I had an almost the same conflict (super introverted and its actually painful when you've prepared for alone time and someone ends it) \n\nI'm not sure whether it's the right answer or not but I gave in and accepted that people in my life would always assume their intrusion is welcome, especially if they don't try and affect what I'm doing. It wasn't worth the hurt I caused them by enforcing the \"give me a heads up\" rule", "You just don't speak in that tone but that is exactly what you are saying. If you like your personal space so much you should consider it about the things in future. And the comments are not controversial they are all calling you out.", "But it is what you're trying to say", "I agree 100%. I get slightly frustrated when my boyfriend comes home early without letting me know...it's not because I don't want him there, because I do, but it's more that I like to know when my solitude is gonna end vs \"surprise!\", Lol. I dunno, maybe I'm just a weirdo, but it's also not hard to send a text to say you're coming home early.", "It\u2019s a safety thing for me (but OP didn\u2019t mention this so I\u2019m not going to use it for judgement). I live in an apartment and I\u2019ve had maintenance people unlock the door and come in while I was in the shower and things like that*. It was terrifying because I couldn\u2019t hear them knocking from the bathroom and it was like an intruder walking in on me while naked and vulnerable. I\u2019ve asked my husband to text me when he\u2019s coming home ever since then. \n\n*I knew the maintenance guys were coming that day, I just didn\u2019t know what time they would arrive in the 8 hour service window.", "It\u2019s not \u201cyour\u201d space though. It\u2019s both your space. It\u2019s his space. He should never be made to feel like he\u2019s intruding on his own space.", "OP, this is way more insightful than the downvotes makes it look. I get being an introvert and a lot of people just don\u2019t understand. If being alone is what recharges your batteries then you need to figure out a way to work that into your relationship openly. Maybe you can sit down and really discuss this with your SO.", "You\u2019re not confined to a bedroom.  I get the introverted thing, and actually I quite like to know when my husband is on his way home because due to ptsd I have a horrendous startle reflex, but if he doesn\u2019t text it\u2019s a nice surprise when he gets home early.  I had 30 years of \u201cme time\u201d when he worked shifts and was on lates or nights, and believe me, it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be - especially if you have children! \n\nI\u2019ve also been confined to our bedroom after multiple surgeries and I longed to be downstairs with my family.  You can actually have too much alone time, even as an introvert.\n\nI can\u2019t handle too much \u201cpeopling\u201d, because it drains my energy, BUT the partners we choose to live with aren\u2019t normally draining.  I don\u2019t consider being around my husband and daughter as \u201cpeopling\u201d so they don\u2019t drain me, but if I do get overloaded (eg husband is watching a loud film) and need some \u201cme time\u201d then I *choose* to go to the bedroom.  That\u2019s my choice.  I wouldn\u2019t dream of resenting the people I choose to share my life with just because they\u2019ve come home early.  It\u2019s their house too!\n\nAre you happy in the relationship?", "Why are you with him if his presence annoys and repells you so much?", "It seems like you are getting plenty of quiet time with him working nights. \nYou want quiet time, go for a walk or a drive but do not expect your partner to have to cater to you because you are an introvert. It seems you are clearly not comfortable living with your partner.", "As an introvert married to an introvert, I always give a heads up when I\u2019m heading home. \u201cHey I\u2019m leaving (place), I\u2019ll be home around X.\u201d Usually with an offer of food picked up or, do we need anything while I\u2019m in Public? My husband does the same. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a fight. I used to do this when I commuted every day, with updates if I was facing traffic or whatever. I do it now when I go to town by myself, and so does my husband.\n\nOP isn\u2019t trying to get their husband to \u201cask permission\u201d, just to let them know what to expect. If there\u2019s not a set time when he\u2019s home, I get that knowing whether to keep reading or start a movie or whatever can be a little anxiety inducing.\n\nIf he\u2019s not willing to send *one text*, geofencing should work. Especially if he gets upset when you\u2019re in the middle of a book/movie that he\u2019s not interested in.", "I agree. It's pretty frustrating to expect to be home alone until 9, but then boyfriend comes home early at 6 and doesn't tell me. It's not that I don't want him there, it's just like you said - I like to know when I can expect solitude vs not. Also, it takes 30 seconds to shoot a text out to say \"hey I'll be home in 30\" or whatever.", "It\u2019s not up to us to dictate how someone else\u2019s relationship should work. It wouldn\u2019t be my choice, but if they\u2019re happy and married, then that is by definition a happy marriage.", "My husband does this and has it synced to the house lights, so all the turn when he comes home. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m getting a text the dining room light suddenly turns on. I find it bizarre. The kids love it though.", "My family uses Google location, mainly because we have a teenage daughter who's fairly new to driving. That app has saved me SO much anxiety.", "Exactly. They love each other and are committed to each other, they just want their own space. I feel like if living together full time is what makes a marriage, what about armed forces spouses? You can be apart for months or years, and sometimes that works for people better than together 24/7", "I just share my opinion about that situation, not tell them how to live their life. One paper that state your relationship is marriage without making the actual living together do not make it marriage. But I don't live in US and I have different opinions about relationships and marriage in general.", "Let\u2019s face it, there were an awful lot of relationships ruined by lockdown - some relationships actively require some time apart to function!", "I don\u2019t live in the US either, but I know exactly one thing only is required to be married: the piece of paper that states your relationship is a marriage.", "We're also responsible for our perception and to educate ourselves on things we don't know or understand.", "My mom is incredibly impulsive. Like leave the country or go to a remote national park impulsive and forget to mention it to her husband or her kids. She also has health problems and what is probably the earliest stages of dementia. My siblings and I track her. Partially because we have had to get her out of weird situations. Like she almost got stuck in Venezuela (I think, some South American country) during the beginning of the pandemic or when I was little she took me to Mexico without telling my Dad. We are all a lot less nervous having her tracked.", "I know that legally is marriage but \"happily married\" just not sound wright  for me.\n\nJudging by down votes on my comments and the divorce rate in US  ( 50-60%) is possible that kind of marriage will be beneficial for them.", "This is some gaslighting nonsense lol. \u201cBabe, me saying that I need you to warn me when you arrive in your own home because it ruins my blissful alone time didn\u2019t actually make you feel bad. It\u2019s just that your perception of what I said to you is all wrong! You really need to educate yourself on things you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s entirely not how that works. We\u2019re responsible for our own actions and how we react to our emotions - that doesn\u2019t mean that if someone hurts our feelings it\u2019s our fault for perceiving it that way.\n\nShe is also responsible for her own actions and can\u2019t just walk away from an interaction like, \u201coh this your issue to deal with if you got hurt by what I said! I\u2019m allowed to say whatever and if you take it badly that\u2019s a you problem!\u201d That\u2019s how how human interactions work and is a recipe nuking all your interpersonal relationships. We\u2019re also responsible to do what we can to not be assholes to the people we claim to love.", "Oh wow! I'm so glad you can check on her. It's great that we have this technology now!\n\nI'm not impulsive at all. I think they mostly like to mess with me. Pay back for all those curfews,  and tell me what friends you're hanging out with rules. They don't live at home and I decided to use one of my free days to go to the beach. Only 2 hours away and they pouted about me enjoying my day without them and then wanted my salt water taffy.", "Idk what you thought I meant...but all of what you said isn't it.\n\nI was agreeing specifically with people being responsible for their own actions.\n\nI expanded that to include perceptions and knowledge building. \n\nSo I guess...case in point about perceptions? \n\nAlso - perceptions and feelings are two different things. Having misperception doesn't render feelings invalid."]}
