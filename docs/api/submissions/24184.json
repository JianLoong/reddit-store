You say \"They're not really my aesthetic but I love the way they look on you and they suit your style. And obviously if you love them and feel comfortable in them, that's all that matters\"", "Nta. Your friend flat out asked if you liked how they looked. You gave an honest answer.  Sure,  you could have been vague with something like,  oh, they're not really my style. But honestly,  this isn't a hill to die on. Your friend is being overly sensitive.", "I believe you're NTA, but it's from the perspective of an allistic person who understands where your friend tripped you up. She was fishing for a compliment, perhaps trying to feel better about how she looks in them or something else is going on that you don't know about. But the way allistic minds work is to hint at what we want without outright saying it. She asked, \"Do you like these?\" but what she \\*meant\\* was, \"Do these look good on me and I want you to say yes even if it's wrong?\"\n\n  \nIt is genuinely a dumb thing we allistic people do that makes no sense.", "The pic was her wearing them right? Chances are she was actually asking if you liked how they looked on her and your answer ended up being \"not really no\".\n\nThen when she said she wasn't expecting that answer you asked why your opinion mattered seemingly doubling down on saying they don't look good on her(while not at all what you meant) so it definitely came across as you insulting her and saying she looked bad in them.\n\nMy general response is something like \"i don't think I'd wear it but it makes your boobs look fantastic\" or something along those lines when asked if I like clothes on a person but if it's on the hanger I'd just say not my style.", "NTA. You and she don\u2019t have the same opinion. It\u2019s not like you told her they look terrible on her or that she looked fat or anything that was actually negative.

Do you think I look good wearing them?\n\n**You**: No, I think you look terrible in these jeans that you told me you love.\n\nSuggestions for how it could have gone:\n* I don't like the style, but I can see why you love them.\n* I'm not a huge fan of the extreme rip look - you look great, though.\n* Wow they clearly make you feel great.\n* Oh no someone stole half of your jeans!

But often when someone asks what you think of an article of clothing they love and bought, they\u2019re not really looking for an opinion. They\u2019re looking for a compliment or if it\u2019s an unorthodox/bold look, they\u2019re looking for support/validation. \n\nLike when someone says, \u201cwhat do you think of my wedding dress?!\u201d the socially acceptable thing to do is say, \u201comg, you look beautiful!\u201d Not \u201cwell, I wouldn\u2019t have pick that out\u201d or \u201cI think that style is kind of ugly.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot really, no\u201d is a bit abrupt. \u201cThey\u2019re not really my style, but you look great!\u201d Or \u201cwhoa! I\u2019ve never seen jeans with such big cutouts like that! I love that you have your own style!\u201d \u201cYou know me. I\u2019m more conservative in my \u2018trousers\u2019 style, but I love that you love them!\u201d Would\u2019ve all be honest and better responses.", "NAH. The reason: I can understand her, but it doesn't mean you were wrong.\n\nSometimes you want to share your joy with someone important and if you get a different reaction, it could be really disappointed and also kinda ruin the joy-bringing thing. Again: it doesn't mean you did something wrong. Just a possible explanation why she react this way.\n\nI would give her time and if she hold a grudge against you, I would explain her that you wouldn't lie and she shouldn't ask your opinion if she can't deal with it.", "I am sorry OP, I can't explain very well, but some people just ask to hear a compliment. \n\nLook I have one or two friends who would not get mad at me, but become sad if I stated a negative opinion about the clothes they're excited about so my go-to answer here is either positive (if  I like it) or I would tell them \"sorry, this is not my style so I can't see it as well as you can\" . Not sure this would work on your friend tho, as she seemed to get really mad at not hearing a positive evaluation.", "NTA - She asked for your opinion and you gave your opinion.", "NTA.

If not don't ask the question.\" \n\nSome  people feel that friends should give them the answer they want to hear. I believe if you are really in a friend you give the person the honest answer.  I want an honest friend not one that just always tells me what I want to hear.\n\nRule to live by: \nIf you're not prepared for the answer don't ask the question.", "NTA\n\nShe asked a question and got an answer.

Who cares what someone else thinks of our clothes.", "NTA technically since she asked, but you need to learn the skill of humorous deflection.", "NTA. She asked, you answered. She's being far too sensitive. You didn't insult her, you just said you don't like the jeans.", "A soft YTA, at the end of the day your friend asked your opinion and you gave it. I would just suggest thinking about giving it in a kinder way. It's not hard to just say, they're not my style personally, but you look great in them.

It is clear now that your friend was asking for your opinion not because she actually wanted it but because she was seeking affirmation. But it\u2019s not really your responsibility to tease that out or to play into compliment fishing. Rather, your friend shouldn\u2019t ask a question if she\u2019s not genuinely interested in and able to accept honest answers. \n\nThat said, next time remember that there\u2019s a way to be truthful without being hurtful.

Stick to your own likes and dislikes!", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Don't ask questions you don't want to hear the answer to. \n\nHowever, this is a cultural differences thing. In interpersonal behaviour, there's this concept of 'saving face'. If you hurt someones ability to 'save face' you hurt the relationship. The thing is, some cultures find it more important to say nice things than to give your honest opinion, and therefore if you say you don't like something, you're hurting their ability to 'save face' and therefore the relationship. While in other cultures it's more important to be honest than to say nice things, and therefore you don't hurt someones ability to 'save face' if you say you don't like something, because you're just being honest and the communication partner understands that you'd be hurting your own ability to 'save face' if you would be dishonest.", "NTA - you were rude with your response and if she didn\u2019t want your opinion why ask", "NTA - You shouldn\u2019t ask for opinions if you\u2019re not ready to hear one differing from your own. \n\nFor future reference though, the way I approach this type of thing is \u201cI personally wouldn\u2019t wear them but if you like them, I\u2019m all for it\u201d or \u201cThey aren\u2019t really my aesthetic but I can see them really working for you.\u201d, etc. It acknowledges the truth, that you don\u2019t like them, but is sensitive to any insecurities they may have about liking something you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by stating your opinion but she might have taken more offense to it because you were a bit blunt.", "NTA.

You could have worded it something like \"No, I would not like them on myself\" but it is quite the same thing as what you said. You did nothing mean or bad there.", "NTA. That wasn\u2019t a hurtful truth.", "Okay so. The things most other commenters are telling you are technically correct but useless in your situation.\n\n\nNo one except maybe the offended party will tell you what you said is rude. It's not \"\"technically\"\" rude, but that technicality ONLY applies when you straight up ask someone if you where rude. They're still gonna feel like you breached an unspoken rule, but because it's unspoken and not \"real\" they're not going to say it to your face.\n\n\nBasically: yes this is indeed one of those weird allistic 'rules\".\n\n\nThe actual POLITE way to respond to \"What do you think?\" questions is to always say something positive.\n\n\nIf you don't actually think it then say something bland like \"It's nice!\", and if you do like it then something more exaggerated like \"I love it!\"\n\n\nThere is a big exception to this, and that's when someone prefaces the question with \"Be honest...\". Usually when they repeat it more than once you can be sure it's sincere, when they only say it once it's a bit ambiguous.\n\n\nAllistics usually just want the reassurance of you saying something positive and care very little about your real opinion. \n\n\nIt's a cheek and tongue way to ask you to lie without doing so directly. \n\n\nWhich is why if they REALLY want honesty they preface it with \"Be honest...\", because it's commonly understood that you *should* be expected to lie otherwise.\n\n\nThat's the \"lesson\" bit. \n\n\nHere's my advice: \n\n\nLife is way easier when you have friends you don't have to fake a neuro type for. Either find friends that get you or ones that understand it's how your brain works and you're not being rude on purpose.", "NTA- She sounds immature for 27.  Of course you're supposed to give your opinion when specifically asked to do so.\n\nShe sounds like an insecure child only wanting praise and agreement.  At my stage of life, having a friend who tells it like it is is much more desirable.  Regarding your friend, she's likely dishonest herself and would only tell you what you want to hear instead of telling you what you need to hear.\n\nRegardless, choice of clothing is subjective.  If she's only willing to wear what EVERYONE likes, she's a boring person.", "NTA\nNext time it might be better to say \u201cit\u2019s not my style but looks good on you\u201d no matter how it looks. \nI only give \u201clooks like you slid down a sandpaper with those pants\u201d to friends I know can take it and asked my opinion and it\u2019s true.
