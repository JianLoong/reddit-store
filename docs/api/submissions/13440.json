Could you just put it back?\n \nShe then ignored me and proceeded to swaddle her baby. I then yelled at her \n\nMe: What the hell?! I asked you if you would put it back.\nHer: I don\u2019t care.

Your sil was rude. And who doesn't bring enough blankets for their baby? I don't even have babies anymore and I still carry a small blanket in my car, jic.", "NTA. You have every right to say if an item you treasure can be used or not....especially by a child that could soil it. \n\nI would recommend putting away the blanket so others don't see it as free game to use. If you want to have it out but not used, maybe create a special way to display it so it is clear it is not to be used.", "NTA. She was a guest in your house and acted disrespectfully. If I were in her position I\u2019d be on my best behavior.\n\nAlso, you said that she continued to put the blanket on the baby after you explicitly asked her not to. Goodbye and good riddance.", "NTA. She's responsible for making sure that her child has clothes and blankets. It's not right to take things in someone else's home, or to argue when told not to.", "NTA\n\nWas there another blanket you could offer though?   Was she under the impression that it's that blanket or her baby goes cold or just didn't want to relinquish that specific blanket?", "Hide the blanket. She will find a way to ruin it.", "NTA", "NTA and good riddance. I guarantee she wouldn\u2019t be allowed back inside my home.", "NTA Good thing that she went to a hotel on her own and you didn'y have to throw her out for her blantant lack of respect.", "Nta Op hey don't use that blanket, it's old and brittle\n\nSIL sure *grabs a different blanket*\n\nIs how a sane person would have responded \n\nSince it's a keepsake maybe you could get it framed?", "NTA\n\nYou said no to that blanket. It was simple enough to ask for a different one.", "NTA. She should've had baby blankets with her but since she didn't, she should've asked for a blanket.\n\nYou should keep the blanket out of sight when you have visitors so nobody else messes with it.", "NTA. She's an entitled jerk.", "NTA", "NTA. Good, she should go to a hotel.", "Info- did you offer an alternative?", "ESH\n\nWhy are you keeping something that means so much to you in a place where anyone could get to it and use it?  If it is so precious, then it should be carefully preserved and put away where this type of thing cannot happen again.\n\nBut your SIL is the AH for not giving the blanket over right away.  Did you at least have something else in your hand that she could use instead?  Or did you just demand the blanket back?", "ESH. This is such a colossal failure in communication, I have trouble believing that this is real. \n\nFirst, if you have an heirloom you should either put it away or put it on display such that it\u2019s obviously not for use, such as hanging it on a wall or using putting it under other display items such as a bunch of photos. You can\u2019t put something in a normal space for usable items and be upset if someone else uses it.\n\nSecond, your SIL is obviously in the wrong for not immediately respecting your wishes, but if she\u2019s caring for an infant then you need to cut her *a little* slack. She\u2019s probably operating on little to no sleep, and if the local weather is pipe-bursting cold, then it\u2019s understandable how her number one priority could be making sure her baby doesn\u2019t also freeze or get sick.\n\nThird, holy shit how is the immediate response not \u201cHere, use this blanket other blanket instead.\u201d SIL obviously wasn\u2019t going to stop until her baby was warm. And if there *wasn\u2019t* another blanket available, then I\u2019d hope that grandma would prefer you prioritize taking care of grand-niece than taking care of an old bit of fabric.\n\nEdit: Also, it\u2019s a good skill to learn little lies that might get the result you want without escalating the situation. \u201cOh you don\u2019t want to use that. That\u2019s my grandma\u2019s blanket. She died in it, and I haven\u2019t washed it.\u201d Guarantee that SIL would let you take it then.", "You didn\u2019t do the best job describing this because it makes you sound like TA, but assuming you had other blankets available, I would say NTA. She was trying to pressure you into letting her use your grandmothers blanket because she also adored it... \n\nYou said you guess she thought her baby was cold... then proceeded to say how you have your blanket stored out of reach. \n\nAgain assuming there are other blankets available, and it was just about warmth. it doesn\u2019t make sense why she didn\u2019t grab a different blanket or asker before grabbing the old one. Unless she really just wanted the old blanket, and she expected you wouldn\u2019t say anything if she just grabbed it.", "So this may end up being unpopular, but NAH. \n\nI do think though that you may have made a social faux paus and should apologize though. \n\nI\u2019ve read enough of these posts to distinguish when an action seems to be from a place of entitlement or not. And I see no sign, based on this post, that suggested that the SIL wanted the blanket for any other reason then for the kid, as in I don\u2019t think she was trying to boundary stomp you. \n\nAnd your boundaries, as people point out, are valid . You are allowed to not have people use the blanket to preserve it and to use the other one you offered. That being said, again because I\u2019ve seen way to many of these, I would bet that you didn\u2019t communicate about the blanket up front before causing a fuss about it, nor did you offer an alternative until after you\u2019d already raised the fuss. And by then she, your SIL, already felt hurt\u2026and I don\u2019t blame her. \n\nI cannot say I wouldn\u2019t have made the same mistake. When I see a blanket, if it\u2019s out, I automatically assume it\u2019s usable. I\u2019d never default to the assumption that it was an heirloom that couldn\u2019t be used. I can see that if she felt she was justified in that regard, she would\u2019ve seen your reaction as completely irrational difference wise, and you probably couldn\u2019t have made more of an impact negatively towards her if you had literally thrown the alternate blanket straight at her face.\n\nThat is why I am saying that you need to be the one to apologize. She did, in my opinion, nothing wrong. And you only did something slightly wrong. Again NAH. But to keep the peace, it has to be you because I wouldn\u2019t have apologized in her shoes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I always check with hosts before just helping myself to a blanket, pillow, sheets, towel, etc. I think it\u2019s normal to have \u201cspecial\u201d ones (handmade, old, etc) or ones set aside for guests. The last time I had guests it was my sister and I specifically told her to help herself to any of the blankets in our linen closet because she asked.

An heirloom blanket is not a reasonable ask, IMO.\n\nNTA", "Okay, then NTA.  She obviously went after a particular blanket that was not readily accessible and she is entitled for grabbing it and not giving it back.  But again, if it\u2019s precious and lives in a closet normally, you may want to get a plastic bag to store it in.  Not just to keep it safe from predatory SILs, but also moths and other critters.", "Yeah but did she actually ask beforehand or only after the incident took place? As in was the SIL warned about the blanket. It makes a huge difference. \n\nAlso, agree to disagree on the norms about asking for a blanket\u2026but maybe we were raised differently. I guess I consider anything that is a usable item, aka not a display only item\u2026like a picture, free range. And I\u2019d personally hate everyone asking me for every little thing. Because once you\u2019ve set the precedent on blankets; one of the most useful items besides towels, remotes, and kitchenware; then, the only rational scenario is for them to ask for everything, i.e.: can I borrow this spoon, can I use the restroom, etc. \n\nAlso, I feel like norms differ on if the guest was invited by the host, as SIL was, and not just overstaying a welcome, and the fact that it is family not an acquaintance, and especially family with a young child.", "Hospital pillows suck, but are great for the car.", "I will keep that in mind :)"]}
