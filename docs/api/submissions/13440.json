Did you at least have something else in your hand that she could use instead?  Or did you just demand the blanket back?", "ESH. This is such a colossal failure in communication, I have trouble believing that this is real. \n\nFirst, if you have an heirloom you should either put it away or put it on display such that it\u2019s obviously not for use, such as hanging it on a wall or using putting it under other display items such as a bunch of photos. You can\u2019t put something in a normal space for usable items and be upset if someone else uses it.\n\nSecond, your SIL is obviously in the wrong for not immediately respecting your wishes, but if she\u2019s caring for an infant then you need to cut her *a little* slack. She\u2019s probably operating on little to no sleep, and if the local weather is pipe-bursting cold, then it\u2019s understandable how her number one priority could be making sure her baby doesn\u2019t also freeze or get sick.\n\nThird, holy shit how is the immediate response not \u201cHere, use this blanket other blanket instead.\u201d SIL obviously wasn\u2019t going to stop until her baby was warm. And if there *wasn\u2019t* another blanket available, then I\u2019d hope that grandma would prefer you prioritize taking care of grand-niece than taking care of an old bit of fabric.\n\nEdit: Also, it\u2019s a good skill to learn little lies that might get the result you want without escalating the situation. \u201cOh you don\u2019t want to use that. That\u2019s my grandma\u2019s blanket.

I guess I consider anything that is a usable item, aka not a display only item\u2026like a picture, free range. And I\u2019d personally hate everyone asking me for every little thing. Because once you\u2019ve set the precedent on blankets; one of the most useful items besides towels, remotes, and kitchenware; then, the only rational scenario is for them to ask for everything, i.e.: can I borrow this spoon, can I use the restroom, etc. \n\nAlso, I feel like norms differ on if the guest was invited by the host, as SIL was, and not just overstaying a welcome, and the fact that it is family not an acquaintance, and especially family with a young child.", "Hospital pillows suck, but are great for the car.", "I will keep that in mind :)", "NTA for protecting your heirloom. Of course, she will try and make you the villain, but she refused to acknowledge that she was in the wrong by first raiding your shelf, next continuing to do what she was asked not to do and then arguing, until she threw the blanket at you not caring whether she damaged it or not. She was definitely in the wrong, but to prevent the possibility of future damage to your grandma's quilt, I suggest you put it in a place that is not visible to the random rude person digging through your belongings.  How did your brother react to her actions? Is he standing by your actions taken to protect your heirloom?", "NTA. You asked her not to use that blanket.

If the blanket was not tossed on a bed, chair or sofa, I personally would have asked if that one was ok or would have asked if she had a blanket I could use, not just grabbed one I wanted to use and then argued about it. OP had no reason to apologize for protecting the item after she specifically requested SIL not use it because it was an old fragile heirloom. SIL on the other hand does. Maybe you recognize another entitled one when you see it and that is why you think OP should apologize. OP need not apologize for any wrondoing or to keep the peace.", "I ended up with over 100 receiving blankets for my first because everyone kept buying him a multi pack.

Whenever I\u2019ve been in that position, I\u2019ve asked the person if they have [insert item] that I could use, rather than go and try to look for it myself. \n\nThat way, they can select a suitable item that they\u2019re comfortable with me using, and I\u2019m not digging around into their things.", "To be fair\u2026I didn\u2019t see that part. OP really should\u2019ve edited that part back into the actual post but neglected to do so and I just went straight off of that. That\u2019s what happens when everyone simply downvotes the comments they don\u2019t like is that others wind up not seeing them. So, I rescind my first comment.\n\nAs for \u201con a shelf\u201d meaning that it was \u201cbeing out\u201d. I guess that just depends on interpretation. And mine is clearly different than everyone else\u2019s here based on my second comment, which I stand by, about needing to ask to do something. \n\nTo me, anything that isn\u2019t explicitly put away, as in \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d, is assumed to be out. Thus, even if it is on a shelf, I still consider it to be out. That being said, seeing a blanket on a shelf would give me pause. But, I\u2019m still not certain I would\u2019ve asked either before grabbing it, even on a shelf, because I see a blanket as a usable item, as in \u201cnot your typical momento\u201d, by default, and as in \u201cnot something you\u2019d not want to use\u201d. And that\u2019s especially since lots of people live in spaces nowadays where they have to get creative with how they store stuff.", "SIL would not need to be warned beforehand. People do not need to tell you everything you are not allowed to use in their house if you visit. You wouldn't be allowed in my house after you rudely grabbed an item off a shelf without asking if it was ok and then argued about it when I said you could not use it.  There is a very big difference between grabbing something off of a shelf, that may have been in the open, but was most likely put away in a closet, than say, using silverware to eat, a pillow or blanket tossed on a couch, or use the bathroom.  Closets, medicine cabinets, offices, are generally deemed off limits by most people without permission and accepted to be that way by most polite people. Do you allow all visitors to your house to borrow your underwear without asking? Or do you tell them ahead of time that they may not borrow your underwear. As I stated earlier, some things are just inherently not for other's use unless you specifically state otherwise and that includes items in closets, medicine cabinets, as well as other items that are not on display as \"special\" items. If uncertain if the host/hostess will ok to use, always ask.", "I will have to agree to disagree. She, SIL, has a kid. A 1 year old kid. Kids need stuff\u2026including blankets\u2026sometimes. It is reasonable to, thus, anticipate the child needing a blanket. If OP didn\u2019t anticipate that scenario and didn\u2019t mention a certain blanket was off limits until after the fact, then frankly that\u2019s on her. She is fine to establish whatever boundaries she wants and to implement them going forward. But that doesn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t be jerkish for getting up in SIL\u2019s grill about it if she is only mentioning it after the fact.\n\nTo prove that point imagine a similar, but made up, scenario: You have a job. Your job starts at 7 am. So long as you work from 0700 to 1700, you get paid. Now imagine you show up one day and your boss is like, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d, even though you showed up when you normally did, and it turns out that they switched your hours without telling you and now you were supposed to come in at 6 am. They gaslight you about being there on time and then pretend like everything\u2019s fine because you can just make up the extra hour tomorrow by coming in at 5 am. That way you still work the same amount of hours and don\u2019t get docked pay. They\u2019re happy campers after that. They\u2019ve offered a solution they think is acceptable. But what about you?\n\nWould that make you angry? hurt? Emotional enough to go to a whole other building to cool off? Because that may be an extreme, but that is a lot closer to a scenario to what happened to OP then what you described. As in it makes you feel like their mistake is your fault. Thus, telling people beforehand makes all the difference. \n\nAnd as for the underwear thing\u2026.obviously not\u2026I\u2019m not a completely savage. And I don\u2019t think it is nearly equal to what is described in this story. I don\u2019t imagine the shelf, if it was in a closet, being in a bedroom. And based on my personal, hands off hostess approach\u2026yes\u2026I\u2019d absolutely let any guests of mine into any closets in common areas without having to hold their hand along the way like a five year old.

I have 4million blankets I can provide to my nephew..... and I actually do have 2 kids. And no I didn't always bring a blanket with me everywhere I went. Especially to my families house. Yes OP has every right to say whoa not that blanket. But is there no other blankets?! This whole scenario could have been avoided had she just gotten a different blanket.  They're both TA.", "I can see why from this tbh\u2026 NTA"]}
