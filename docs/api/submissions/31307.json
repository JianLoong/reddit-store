{"id": 31307, "submission_id": "17z9yjw", "title": "AITA for telling a coworker she isn't Native American?", "selftext": "I was speaking with coworkers and the topic of a nearby town came up. The town has a difficult to pronounce name and my coworker made a comment about what kind of idiot came up with the name. I pointed out that it was a word is from a Native American language. My coworker replied with \"well, I'm allowed to make fun of it then. I'm part Indian, Native American.\"\n\nMy coworker appears very white. From what she has told me, her family has lived in the same rural area for years and this is the first time she has mentioned anything about this. Curious, I asked her what nation she was from and she said she had a Cherokee ancestor. I ask if she is registered with a Cherokee tribe and she says no. I ask who the ancestor was and she said her great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole. I am white and know very little about Native Americans but I DO know that white people love to claim to be Cherokee without any evidence to back it up. And that the Cherokee nation doesn't have princesses. I know this because my estranged aunt used to say the same thing while everyone else in my family said they had literally NEVER been told about Indigenous ancestry. A DNA test of another aunt proved this later on. We're just white.\n\nSo (and this is where I might have been rude) I tell her that the Cherokee don't have princesses and she's probably wrong. She got really defensive and insisted it was true. I told her that lots of white people claim to be Native and aren't, and that with DNA tests there isn't really an excuse not to look into it. Needless to say the vibe became awkward quickly and this coworker has been ignoring me since and seemed pissed at me.\n\nAnother coworker said I should have just let it go and not said anything. My reasoning is if she's going to say \"I'm Native American so I can make fun of them\" she better be damn sure she's ACTUALLY Native American. And if she is Cherokee, I feel like she still can't make fun of a DIFFERENT tribe's language anyway! So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT for clarification: I do understand that there are a lot of white passing Indigenous people, which is what I originally assumed and why I asked for more details because I thought she might like to share. I thought she was going to say she was from the tribe whose land we are on/she was making fun of (we do not live anywhere near the Cherokee people's original land or the current Cherokee nation). I did not expect her to use the Cherokee Princess line and by then was mad at her for being insensitive about the language thing", "created_utc": 1700435669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17z9yjw/aita_for_telling_a_coworker_she_isnt_native/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Back to her Great-Great Grandmother, she inherited somewhere around one sixteenth of her DNA from that ancestor. The problem is that each generation inherits approximately half of their DNA from each parent, and then passes approximately half of their DNA to the next generation.

I'm not Cherokee, but a tribe that was originally from a similar area and often gets claimed by folks who are non-indigenous as well. \n\nYour co-worker shouldn't be making racist jokes either way. I certainly wouldn't, regardless of my heritage. But calling her ancestry into question isn't your job.

She got really defensive and insisted it was true. I told her that lots of white people claim to be Native and aren't, and that with DNA tests there isn't really an excuse not to look into it.

People embellish through the generations.", "Actually I don't.  I have clear and known white ancestors, though present as black, as does my wife.  Most African Americans have some white in them.  DNA confirmed the family history, even know which Clan from Scotland I can claim membership in.", "Kind of how I felt about the Senator from Mass", "Exact thought, like shes clearly racist and op called her out.", "You\u2019re right. I should have phrased it differently.", "We dont know if OP is wrong or not. OP doesnt even know. \ud83e\udd23", "It is a VERY common misunderstanding and myth. \n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/the-cherokee-princess-myth-1421882\n\n\nIt doesnt mean we know anything about the coworkers geneology. And OP going at her for it makes OP the asshole.", "Call them out in a funny way. It keeps moods light and happy while getting the job done", ">I want to do one of those DNA tests\n\nAll my life I was told I was something different but I took a test and the results were completely different. I was told I was a quarter Native American but I'm not even that, just 2% indigenous.", "I have dark hair and eyes too, I tan pretty well, and I had a mongolian spot on my bum as a baby, which confused the hell out of my American born English mother.", "My understanding is that all the DNA sites are pretty much the same, but you can upload your results to the other sites! So you can take a 23andMe, see relatives that pop up and their analysis of your racial background + health risks, then take the file to Ancestry and see relatives that pop up there and their analysis.", "Same. If pressed, my culture is RHODE ISLAND. the gfy is implied but there", "I'm starting to think that there was some sort of Mandela Effect with the boomers and their parents/grandparents about this. Like, did they all read the same story and internalize it? My mother used to tell some convoluted story about some ancestors being kidnapped by the Cherokee and being raised by them, and then returning to white society with their offspring. And it's always Cherokee, it's never Hopi or Sioux or Apache, always Cherokee.", "I heard Elizabeth Warren is related to her", ">Nancy Ward\n\nhuh, that's amazing, I just did a wiki deep dive on her!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy\\_Ward", "Man my family is boring. On the subject of our heritage they just say \"I dunno, probably most of Europe got in there somewhere.\"", "Now see, I say I\u2019m \u201cViking\u201d but I don\u2019t mean it as a white supremacy thing just as a short way of describing my ancestry - my DNA test shows that I am like 95% from places the Vikings went around visiting regularly and Scandinavia proper but listing them all is annoying. So it just means \u201cif it\u2019s a country you think of the Vikings visiting a lot, there\u2019s good odds one of my ancestors was from there.\u201d", "The term up here in Canada is First Nations for the Nations that predated contact and weren't Inuit. There is also the Metis Nation. \n\nSome do use the term Indian because it is a legal term outlined in the Indian Act, which governs Indian Status and the rights stemming from said Status. So to them, identifying as Indian is a way to reinforce the status and identity that the government has attempted to erase.", "This isn\u2019t true and you could just learn stuff instead of being defensive. But in this case I agree that there\u2019s no way OP\u2019s coworker is Native regardless lol. NTA\n\nETA from the national Museum of the American Indian website: \u201cIn the United States, Native American has been widely used but is falling out of favor with some groups, and the terms American Indian or Indigenous American are preferred by many Native people. Native peoples often have individual preferences on how they would like to be addressed. When talking about Native groups or people, use the terminology the members of the community use to describe themselves collectively.\u201d", "That\u2019s because it\u2019s the same as OP\u2019s post, someone claiming to be apart of some heritage but having no idea about the culture or not actually raised in it is a bit offensive. And Americans tend to be the worst at it.", "Oh yeah, that is definitely true. I'm talking about more about the stereotypes and such.", "That isn't a source for your claim. It's positing a potential verification method.", "That\u2019s fantastic that you know your Clan. And yeah the White Ancestors was what I was referring to as Thomas Jefferson for.  I have a White Great x8 Grandfather on my Mohawk side for similar reasons. I\u2019m like 1/64th Welsh.  \n\nBut I have a lot of Black friends who took DNA tests and found they were 1/4 or more Indigenous. A coworker even matched as a relative of mine way back through a common Mohawk ancestor.", "Who actually cares? The point is the coworker is acting like a racist, got called out and now is acting butt hurt because of it", "Op didnt go for her geneology. Op just pointed out that Cherokee princesses are a myth, so she cant have descended from them. Ops coworker was using bs reason to excuse her blatant racism and op didnt stand for it. That makes op a good person.", "Nah, I prefer telling racists they are being racists because if you make it seem like a joke when you are calling them out then they will still think its okay. Be mean and rude about it", "I grew up with the Cherokee princess story, then I found out somewhere that Cherokee princess was generally a nicer way of saying there was a black person in your ancestry, so I was pretty surprised to find out that both were true. Funnily enough, I\u2019m more West African than I am Native American.", "Thanks for that info!\n\nI might actually have to invest in one now because I'm honestly curious to see if my mom is telling the truth!\n\nI mean, i know I'm something because her dad's first name is Octaviano, but that's about it lol", "Not being defensive, just agreeing that \u201cIndian\u201d is what some indigenous people prefer to be called. At the end of the day, every indigenous person can choose what he/she/they want to be called. From discourse online though it seems like younger generations (25 and younger) prefer to use specific language to describe themselves (e.g., Navajo, Lakota, Inuit). I think as America becomes more diverse I see more often people from India referred to as \u201cIndians\u201d and American indigenous people as \u201cNative American\u201d/\u201cAmerican Indian\u201d etc.", "We came to the US via the Caribbean.  That is where the white came from, Macpherson in my case.  Our daughters are a spectrum of skin tones and hair types.  Genetic roulette can have pretty results.", "And the calling out makes OP the asshole. But thank you for the summary of events. I read it already and rendered my opinions. You run along now.", "Whatever works!", "Just be aware of the recent data breach with those DNA testing sites and what those aholes are using it for.", "I don\u2019t necessarily disagree, but your posts use a real tone of authority and if you\u2019re not Native I just think you don\u2019t know enough abt this to be randomly opining abt it on the internet and making universalizing statements about what younger Native folks do and don\u2019t prefer.", "Oh absolutely.\n\n\nIt\u2019s funny though because my husband was adopted. He has contact with his biodad but not his biomom (prison). He took a DNA test. His biodad insists Cherokee ancestry but DNA proved it was actually African ancestry.", "I call out racists too because that's what needs to happen. Shut down the racists. OP did what needed to be done imo. And you are welcome. It took me rereading it twice for me to understand it", "True. I mean, if you manage to make it funny but said racist realized that you don't play that game good on ya. I just prefer being blunt and rude because racists irritate me.", "Now run along. My mind remains unchanged.", "That's nice but I aint running along anywhere unless I truly want to.", "Pretendians have a long history of claiming a status they are not entitled to. They don't have a family history of genocide, and atrocities inflicted on them. But the seek to STEAL the benefits that being one of the survivors of that history are entitled to. \n\nIf you want to claim you have status, you had better be able to prove the claim. \n\nI can, with a government issued status card and everything."]}
