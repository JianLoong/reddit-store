{"id": 31307, "submission_id": "17z9yjw", "title": "AITA for telling a coworker she isn't Native American?", "selftext": "I was speaking with coworkers and the topic of a nearby town came up. The town has a difficult to pronounce name and my coworker made a comment about what kind of idiot came up with the name. I pointed out that it was a word is from a Native American language. My coworker replied with \"well, I'm allowed to make fun of it then. I'm part Indian, Native American.\"\n\nMy coworker appears very white. From what she has told me, her family has lived in the same rural area for years and this is the first time she has mentioned anything about this. Curious, I asked her what nation she was from and she said she had a Cherokee ancestor. I ask if she is registered with a Cherokee tribe and she says no. I ask who the ancestor was and she said her great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole. I am white and know very little about Native Americans but I DO know that white people love to claim to be Cherokee without any evidence to back it up. And that the Cherokee nation doesn't have princesses. I know this because my estranged aunt used to say the same thing while everyone else in my family said they had literally NEVER been told about Indigenous ancestry. A DNA test of another aunt proved this later on. We're just white.\n\nSo (and this is where I might have been rude) I tell her that the Cherokee don't have princesses and she's probably wrong. She got really defensive and insisted it was true. I told her that lots of white people claim to be Native and aren't, and that with DNA tests there isn't really an excuse not to look into it. Needless to say the vibe became awkward quickly and this coworker has been ignoring me since and seemed pissed at me.\n\nAnother coworker said I should have just let it go and not said anything. My reasoning is if she's going to say \"I'm Native American so I can make fun of them\" she better be damn sure she's ACTUALLY Native American. And if she is Cherokee, I feel like she still can't make fun of a DIFFERENT tribe's language anyway! So AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT for clarification: I do understand that there are a lot of white passing Indigenous people, which is what I originally assumed and why I asked for more details because I thought she might like to share. I thought she was going to say she was from the tribe whose land we are on/she was making fun of (we do not live anywhere near the Cherokee people's original land or the current Cherokee nation). I did not expect her to use the Cherokee Princess line and by then was mad at her for being insensitive about the language thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:  \nholy shit. thank you to everyone who is adding their perspective. I appreciate it. And to anybody who is saying I should worry about HR; I don't plan to bring this up again and I'll report any disrespectful comments in the future. \n\n  \nThis is probably my fault for how I wrote it, but I promise the conversation was very casual until the princess part. I was genuinely curious and she seemed happy to share her answers. We aren't near the Cherokee nation. I live in New England. I know there are white passing people with Indigenous heritage. And to clarify she was not insulting a Cherokee name.\n\n  \nI think I might be stupid and I don't know what DNA tests are? I thought you submitted them, got some results, and started building a family tree from there/look up records/fact check. Apparently this is genealogy and is similar but different. So I'm dumb. After reading your comments I realize saying DNA test came across very disrespectful. That was not my intention but I recognize that many of you interpreted it that way and I apologize. I also did not realize there was an under representation of Native American DNA in the big name DNA testing companies. \n\n  \nAlso a lot of people think I'm a white woman. Truly, I'm flattered but I'm just gay.

Back to her Great-Great Grandmother, she inherited somewhere around one sixteenth of her DNA from that ancestor. The problem is that each generation inherits approximately half of their DNA from each parent, and then passes approximately half of their DNA to the next generation.

That said, blood quantum is a very touchy subject and I'd steer clear of it because you have no (figurative or literal) skin in the game. \n\nAs a \"white passing\" tribal member myself, my understanding is that DNA tests are often flawed because the indigenous sample set is far too small and potentially dubious in nature. I have the good fortune of a well-documented family history on my side going back to just before the Trail of Tears. I'm not Cherokee, but a tribe that was originally from a similar area and often gets claimed by folks who are non-indigenous as well. \n\nYour co-worker shouldn't be making racist jokes either way. I certainly wouldn't, regardless of my heritage. But calling her ancestry into question isn't your job.

And that the Cherokee nation doesn't have princesses. I know this because my estranged aunt used to say the same thing while everyone else in my family said they had literally NEVER been told about Indigenous ancestry. A DNA test of another aunt proved this later on. We're just white. \n\nSo (and this is where I might have been rude) I tell her that the Cherokee don't have princesses and she's probably wrong. She got really defensive and insisted it was true. I told her that lots of white people claim to be Native and aren't, and that with DNA tests there isn't really an excuse not to look into it. Needless to say the vibe became awkward quickly and this coworker has been ignoring me since and seemed pissed at me.\n\nAnother coworker said I should have just let it go and not said anything. My reasoning is if she's going to say \"I'm Native American so I can make fun of them\" she better be damn sure she's ACTUALLY Native American. And if she is Cherokee, I feel like she still can't make fun of a DIFFERENT tribe's language anyway! So AITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And a couple of them confirm she was Shawnee.   \n\nWhew.  Sorry, a long story about really nothing other than I really love history, ancestry, and all that stuff.   And shout out for how the internet has made so much of this knowledge accessible and like the OP said, we don't have to be uneducated.   There are so many different type of records out there and now the DNA testing.  I love it.  A new kind of \"The truth is out there\" lol", "My mom who was a boomer told this story and my sister who desperately wanted to be a marginizaled person has built an entire career off being native. From my research we are not remotely native, this does seem to be a very common story told by people years ago", "Ya I also think that boomer\u2019s parents survived the dust bowl, right? So they moved through Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, etc. lots of these stories seem to be from there, so maybe? My grandmother said same.. she was born in 1910. My grandfather 190", "To be fair to her ancestor, the government has not been very fair and equal to the indigenous population. It's sad that she doesn't get the benefits, her ancestor probably thought,' This is suspicious. I'm not giving my name to the feds.' \nThe blood test results can be a slippery slope. For example say one family of any tribe constantly pics a non tribe member as their spouse and have kids. The entire time the family can be registered live in the reservation be active members of the culture and be full on Experts and starting their own culture but the genetics says they don't match after so many generations.     \n\nThere's also the fun fact, for New Zealand, the Maori people don't have a blood quantum*, as long as you can trace at least one ancestry no matter how far back you are considered Maori by the Maori people. I don't know about the New Zealand government, but it is culturally accepted no matter who you are or how you look or where you grew up you can come back to the motherland and participate in the community and  are accepted.  \n*Corrected", "yeah lots of creepy blood quantum stuff and lots of indigenous folks didn't trust govt registries for very understandable reasons (including not wanting to get jail time for being off reserve land without a pass etc). \n\nalso, just because you have indigenous dna doesn't mean you get to claim indigenous heritage. i have Huguenot ancestry on one side of my mom's family, but i can't swan back to France now and claim that identity... one great great grandparent who didn't keep family connections to a culture/language/national identity isn't enough. Whereas the Scottish sides were passed down, and I have a lot more connection to those parts. Still can't get a UK passport though! \n\nDNA can help prove it, but you also gotta have a fairly continuous connection to the people (obviously with exceptions for adoption etc) to claim identity.", "Many Indians that could pass as white opted not to register. They saw how the govt treated them and it was their chance to escape govt control. My great great grandfather was one of them.", ">The family lore was that when the government was signing members of the tribe up her ancestor didn't want to be on the list for some reason.\n\nTbf after the Trail of Tears it's not surprising a Cherokee might not want to register as such with the government.

That some claimed native American ancestry to hide African ancestry.\n\nWhile being \"pure white\" was considered superior, there was some level of respect for native American ancestry. While African ancestry was something to be ashamed of.\n\nI don't have any sources though.", "One reason I wanted to do a DNA test was to find out if my grandma's story about our family had any truth behind it. I was actually surprised to see Native American listed in the results, like it wasn't all BS after all. There was no \"Cherokee princess\" talk though, the story at least made historical sense.", "My great-grandfather was ashamed of his heritage. I have Mingo ancestry (A small-ish band of Shoshone) and can trace back to it. My great-grandparents both looked very native, but my GGF swore he was 100% Irish. We do have Irish ancestry too, but he was definitely NOT 100%!!! The Mingo have been absorbed into one of those mish-mash tribes that they stuck a bunch of other tribes in. I did find out recently that there is a language that has been preserved. Our ancestry was very important to my Grandfather who wished he had been brought up not to be ashamed of our heritage.", "People are so used to associating the \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d and \u201cScandinavian\u201d look with all White people that we all forget about the numerous ethnic groups that were in Europe.

(general mix of all the whitest nationalities to the point of being nearly see-through)", "My Mum JOKINGLY calls me a Euro-mutt. I know about my family ancestry, because I a, did a test and got definitive answers, and b, did some research similar to \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" but without being famous. Going back to just my great grandparents, my maternal side of the family covers English, Irish and French, my paternal Scottish, Russian, and Finnish. Going back further, there's German, Dutch and Norwegian. Though, my Aunt might like to squabble it out with OP's coworker, according to her, we've got a Romany Gyspy Princess in our lineage. Personally, I think she's full of it, and put as much stock into her claims on our heritage as her opinions on climate change and vaccines.", "Still weird thing to say. Viking wasn't a race or ethnicity or even a country. Just historically makes no sense to call ypirself viking or from vikings. Like I'm 80% Scandinavian (according to those DNA kits) bit I don't walk around saying I'm viking or anything despite the ancestry making showing a typical viking route over time. I just say I'm American with northern European ancestry. Grew up standard white American, we have no Scandinavian traditions or ties in the family except for our last name.

My grandfather swears his grandmother was full native American and the photos I have found it does seem possible. However her parents are white but.... she is the oldest child and has an interesting name. So the mystery is there on my side lol. Documentation is spotty far enough back.", "that's kind of what happened in my family; I had an ancestor in the Quebec area who married a native lady who converted to Christianity. We don't know her tribe of origin because she took a French name, but given the geographical area she could have been Algonquin.", "My dad is oh-so proud of our Italian heritage, to the point he's a walking stereotype. I did my DNA test. According to him I should be at least 25%, I'm only 2%. Gave me a right good chuckle", "Keep in mind a few things. \n\nA lot of Native people, even ones who live on reservations and speak the language, have mixed ancestry.\n\nDNA does not pass down in perfect percentages, and not every gene is ethnicity-specific.\n\nThe commercial ancestry tests have really small sample sizes of North American indigenous DNA pools. The results aren\u2019t accurate.\n\nDNA is a helpful tool when trying to track down ancestry, but it\u2019s not everything.

Their samples of North American Indigenous peoples are based off a very small number of people from something like 6 of the 300+ currently existing groups.", "yeah, that's the real tragedy of the NA genocide, but no one is helped by some white bread dude from Denver claiming indigenous identity because he has some distant relative. Especially because mostly people claim indigenous identity to get away with being assholes (well, i'm part Cherokee and \\*I\\* don't think the Washington R\\*dskins should change their name), to get acclaim (oh yes, I'm eligible for all these awards and grants because I'm Cree!) or to avoid feeling responsible for being part of a colonizing group.", "It\u2019s not exactly the same thing as being Irish, but being Irish American is its own culture. Immigrants to the US settled in neighborhoods of people from their home countries, and remnants of those little subcultures still live on today.", "What a narrow-minded ideology. People in the US aren't claiming to be a part of the heritage or culture of the places their ancestors are from, they're literally just stating where their ethnicity tracks back to. I get to say I'm Irish, Italian, and German because my great grandparents and great great grandparents were born and raised in these places before leaving for America. That doesn't mean I wear traditional Bavarian clothing, eat pasta like it's the only food around, or drink like water is unsafe. All it means is that my ancestors come from these different parts of Europe.\n\nNow, OP's coworker is trying to claim ethnic relation to justify her racist statement. That is wildly different than what most Americans claim, though.", "Sure and that's fine but they also need to understand that most Europeans don't care and in fact feel insulted that their americanised version of their culture is paraded about. \n\nI lived in America for a while with my then partner who was from Northern Ireland.

They can pronounce it.", "I don't. My father's grandmother was born on a reservation, and her records go back to when she started kindergarten, in 1905.

I don't personally know anyone that's claimed to be Cherokee or any other tribe, but I grew up/live in VA/Carolinas.\n\nI \nI think maybe they are the most well-known tribes andxwere one of the largest.  So easier for ppl to claim Cherokee.", "> Why is it always Cherokee, do they not know any other tribes?\n\n Probably because the trail of tears was so widely publicized it made them seem more familiar. Ironically in spite of their large reputation the Cherokee, like every other Indian Tribe were not nearly populous enough to have been married off to so many white people. The largest tribes in present day US had the population of a small town, and only a few were that big, most ranged from a few dozen to a few hundred, with anything over 1,000 being fairly large.", "> Why is it always Cherokee, do they not know any other tribes?\n\nits a jeep thing.", "Probably started with one dude back in the 1800s saying he had in-jun blood to get money, his kids heard about that and passed it down to their kids who telephoned it into the most recognizable tribe they knew \"Great Grandma was an Indian? like the Cherokee we learned about in school\" Then they pass it down to their kids and eventually, people just think they have a Cherokee ancestor", "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/10/cherokee-blood-why-do-so-many-americans-believe-they-have-cherokee-ancestry.html", "It\u2019s not about blood quantum.

So she could have been Blackfoot?  I assume records don\u2019t go back that far though.  \n\nSay your great great grandma was 100% indigenous.  Technically her kid (if it was had with someone who was not indigenous) would be 50% (your great grandparent).  Then your grandparent would be 25%.  Your parent would be 12.5%.  And you would be 6.25%?  But what are the odds that exactly 6.25% of your genes actually came from her after all these generations?\n\nBut then I guess where I\u2019m also confused is do most people come out with 0.5% or pretty low numbers for indigenous in their DNA or would most people come out with none at all?  I\u2019m curious what your other family members would come out with on the test.  \n\nAlso I\u2019m just spit balling here so thanks for bearing with me.
