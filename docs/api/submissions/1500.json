I had 3 guinea pigs at the time. \n\nI called everywhere to find someone to watch them and get them out of the smoke, and then I had to get basic belongings out with my mother and searched for a hotel to stay in for the next 2 weeks. I won\u2019t be able to live in my home for the next 6 months. 2 of my pets passed at my friend\u2019s house. I wasn\u2019t even there for them when they died. I could\u2019ve at the very least sat with them, instead I slept in my hotel room like a dumbass while they suffered.\n\nToday at school, I thought I was being slick when I was crying in class, but my other friend kindly let me know afterwards how clearly devastated I was. I, (16) and my friend (17) are in our senior year. I don\u2019t have my license yet.\n\nLast period, my Mom texted me asking me if I could get my friend to drive me to where we\u2019re staying, which is 4 mins away from our school, because she was dealing with our burnt house. Context: friend usually drives me on Wednesdays, since my house is on the way to hers. I told her, she wasn\u2019t happy about it, and told me to walk. \n\nI live in Canada. The ground is covered in ice. My winter coat is covered in soot at home, I\u2019m frail physically (chronic illness), and I was also running a cold with a fever. (She knew all of this, we\u2019ve known each other for 8 yrs) In the end, she begrudgingly drove me. \n\nOn the car, she talked about how much this would make her later to home, how she wasn\u2019t my personal chaperone, to not ask her to drive me again. I told her it was just for emergencies, that this was a special occasion. She asked me what was going on, (she knew everything i just wrote) I said my mom was dealing with the house. She didn\u2019t say anything, just told me to turn on Google maps for her. When we pulled in in front of the hotel, she said it would\u2019ve taken me the same amount of time to walk, then she told me to get out, that she definitely was NOT parking. I left almost sobbing, and that was it. \n\nIt was so awkward. I was just sitting there dripping in tears and snot holding out my phone with Google Maps set up in front of her as she drove.\n\nIn her defense, she was in a bad mood, she has autism (me too) and is bad at picking up social cues, and I did my best to hide how upset I was the whole day. I still feel supremely pissed and just heartbroken. I honestly thought we were soulmates, I want nothing more than to walk to the ends of the earth with her, I\u2019ve always admired how carefree and smart and creative and sweet she is, and her just being around has made my life so much better, but right now I want to scream at her. I didn\u2019t expect for her to genuinely not care and do this when I needed her the most.
