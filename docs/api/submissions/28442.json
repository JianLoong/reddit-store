Your SIL. \n\nPeople can mind their own damned business about your plans, or lack of plans, to reproduce.

Good for you on kicking her out.  Clearly they have no concept of boundaries.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour SIL is an abusive and intruding AH - have a lot less contact with her.", "NTA. If you and your boyfriend don\u2019t want children that\u2019s none of her business. To throw previous trauma in your face is disgusting behaviour, and she should be the one to apologize to you.", "NTA. Your decision not to parent has nothing to do with her fertility. I can empathize that her fertility journey is likely stressful and painful emotionally and physically but an adult needs to be able to not project their own issues upon others, especially in such a hurtful way. \n\nHaving her leave was the best way to ensure that the situation did not escalate.", "Info: \u201cI just shook my head and said good luck\u201d\n\nWas this in a positive truly wishing her luck kind of way or a dismissive scoffing \u201cgood luck\u201d kind of way?", "Your SIL is obviously very unhappy, while you can understand her unhappiness it is not ok for her to turn on you, judge your choices and deliberately tear you down by bringing up past traumas, she is bitter and vindictive lashing out at you and its pure audacity for anyone to suggest you reacted poorly to that. NTA.", "Nta, maybe she isnt meant to be a mother with that attitude. Not everyonr wants to breed.", "NTA.\n\nI want you to hear me and hear me well here, and please get your partner to read this as well:\n\nYour decision as to whether or not you have children has no effect on anybody else's life. It affects you and your partner, nobody else.\n\nThe norm in society is to become an adult, find a partner and have children within a specific timeframe. Those of us who fall outside those norms, regardless of reason, are judged harshly despite our decisions not hurting others.\n\nFor some, they feel judged by us because they cannot imagine not living up to the expectations of others. Others feel like your decision somehow makes their desires seem more selfish or seem lesser.\n\nI have been openly and vocally childfree since I was a teenager. I have a TikTok account where I speak openly about my decision, why I had my tubes tied and why I knew it was the right decision for me. The reason I have spoken openly about it is specifically because normalising this as a highly individual choice that *everyone* has a right to make without outside influence is necessary.\n\nI have gotten *death threats* from both men and women, those who have kids and those who are infertile. Because they see my decision as insulting because *they* cannot imagine a life where someone who *could* have kids would choose not to.\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong. Your SIL's infertility is not your fault and you know that it is heartbreaking for her. That understanding does not mean you should bend to her will.\n\nWhat she did was horrific. She weaponised the frustration, anger and sadness she has about her own struggles in order to make you *feel lesser* for not living the way she would if she had the opportunity to.\n\nThis is not on you. She told you that you need a therapist to \"fix\" you, essentially. As if you're broken.\n\nThis is an *incredibly* insulting thing to say. It is disrespectful, it is cruel and it is utterly uncalled for.\n\nAnd the fact that your partner is wanting *you* to apologise for snapping after being *repeatedly* pushed is absurd. It is beyond vile that he could hear her *out your trauma* as something to be used to make you feel unworthy is *disgusting*.\n\nIt sounds horrific to say, but someone with her attitude toward therapy, her lack of understanding for your situation and her utter callousness does not deserve to be a parent.\n\nI fully empathise that infertility is heartbreaking but that is *her* issue. That is something *she* needs to deal with. It is not a cudgel she can use to beat you into submitting to her wants.\n\nGenuinely, I hope she remains childless until she sorts herself out.\n\nYour partner can nut up and call his family out for their shittiness.", "NTA, she sounds unhinged. You shouldn't tolerate being treated with such disrespect in your own home. She was begging to be tossed out.", "Do not apologize. She wanted to be the center of attention. No matter what your response, she was going to go at you. She crossed a line when bringing up your material relationship. Your in-laws coddle her, it's time it stopped.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your AIL is baby-crazy.", "NTA- She is projecting her frustration on you. She can\u2019t have children and is angry that you are making the choice not to be parents. Children are not for everyone and her snide comments are unnecessary. \n\nTell your boyfriend you will apologize when his sister enters therapy for her issues.", "NTA. I feel sorry for her, but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to attack your entirely valid choices.", "NTA. sil needs therapy for her child issues.", "NTA. Although I do wonder if maybe your partner hasn't been honest with you about whether he wants kids? But may have shared this desire with his sister? Hence her comments? As otherwise it's a very odd thing for her to say. Have you approached this with him? \n\nHaving said that you are under no obligation to have children. You are not wasting your life if you don't have them. It's actually very responsible and mature of you to recognise this and not be pressured. \n\nKids are far too precious to have parents that are anything but 100% sure about their existence. People don't consider that what if's. We ended up with a son with special needs. He will need long life care. Long after we are gone. He was very much wanted and planned for but we never considered that our child could ever have special needs. It wasn't even on our rador. He is adored but life is hard. I dread to think how parents who weren't even sure if they ever wanted kids would cope. Kids are a life long commitment. Maybe even beyond 18 years. Never let anyone pressure you.", "NTA. She might have seen you as dismissive but her outburst was unwarranted. You could have said much worse to her but didn't.\n\nMaybe your SIL should see a therapist. These punitive aggressive behaviors don't increase the chances of fertility treatments working, just the opposite.", "NTA\n\nShe insulted you and was disparaging you in your house. Where you pay rent and bills.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.\n\nIf you bf feels you need to apologize, then he needs to go too.", "NTA\n\nShe is not entitled to project her wants onto you. \n\nShe then got nasty.", "NTA. She's angry and is going through every emotion known to mankind. Having your body betray you in any way is bad. Worse when you can't have the original family people plan. She can foster or adopt so there are options. I think she's attacking you because you can (???) have kids but choose not to.", "> *\"I just shook my head and said 'good luck'\"*\n\nWhy be so dismissive and caustic about something that clearly means a great deal to your SIL? \n\nESH, but you were the instigator of this entire argument.", "ESH.\n\nWhy did you need to say good luck and shake your head at the same time..? Clearly SIL is overbearing, but you didn't need to say that or be like that.", "ESH. You are both judgemental immature assholes.", "Yikes! Are you really sure you want to be connected with this dysfunctional family? Your boyfriend wants you to kneel and beg for forgiveness in a disagreement his sister created by repeatedly jabbing at you. The whole exchange was her fault, and her obsession with pregnancy is unhealthy, to say the least. She mocked your trauma, but it's only her distress that matters to any of them.\nYou're NTA, and I'd advise you to seriously reconsider your boyfriend as a partner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's hard to interpret that as you wishing her well instead of being sarcastic.", "were you nodding? or did u shake ur head side to side and say it? not defending her, im just confused on that detail. because her reaction wasn\u2019t great but shaking ur head (like \u201cno\u201d) could\u2019ve made her think u were mocking/being dismissive", "I nodded affirmatively, I think I expressed myself poorly and it sounded a bit dubious", "Yeah, I think when you said this: *I just shook my head and said \"good luck\"* \\-- it came across as sarcastic or unkind due to the view of shaking one's head vs nodding."]}
