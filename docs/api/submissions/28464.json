He has autism and goes to a special needs school.  Last year, he was involved in an excurricular activity playing the drums.  He did well, had fun, but this year, for reasons known only to him, he just isn't into it.  He thinks he might want to do it next year, but has decided that he's not doing it this year.  I'm okay with this.  It is, after all, an extracurricular activity offered for personal enrichment.\n\nThe trouble is that my mother (67F) and grandmother (87F), who are both very present in his life, are not so accepting of his decision.  At first, they kept telling him they want him to do it, to which he said, \"No.  I said no.  No means no.  No.  No.\"  They told me that I need to sign him up anyway.  I am not comfortable with this, and I told them so.  No is a complete sentence. \n\nThis is not acceptable to my mother and grandmother.  My grandmother has said that unless he signs up to play the drums, she's not speaking to him.  Then, she told me that until I sign him up, she's not speaking to me, and then she'll die, and I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life.\n\nMy mother says that we're both a disappointment and that he's only refusing because I'm a \"terrible mother\" and a \"worse daughter.\"  That we have \"stolen the joy\" from an elderly woman who is nearing the end of her life who only wants to hear her great-grandson play the drum, and how can I be so heartless?\n\nI feel so guilty, like if I don't sign him up, I'm going to cause my grandmother to die from a broken heart.  My son remains unphased.  He straight up told my mother (regarding my grandmother):  \"I'm not going to do it.  I said I'm not going to do it.  I did it last year, she saw me do it, she needs to stop being so obsessed.\"\n\nI've asked him what he'll do if I sign him up for drum class.  He says:  \"I will sit there until it is over.  I will not do it.  And I will not ever do it again.\"\n\nI'm really struggling to hold firm, but they are so good at wearing me down.  I don't believe that signing my son up for this against his will would be of benefit to him.  I think my mother and grandmother are being selfish and unreasonable, and they think I'm being selfish and unreasonable.\n\nSo I'll put this up here to you.

Do yourself a favor and set (and stick to!) clear boundaries with them, that this will be an off-limits topic.

I thought your son also wasn't telling you, and that is what I considered important.  I can understand that it can be necessary to set firm boundaries.  Thank you.", "No.", "Why must he give a detailed explanation as to why  he doesn't want to play the drums this year?\n\nHe tried it last year and might want to do it next year.
