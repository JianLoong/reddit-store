(I\u2019m in the police academy and we are doing ground fighting) Boyfriend offered to come with me, drove separate. While we were in the packed waiting room we both got up to use the bathroom and our seats were taken. We found better, more comfortable seats and said if one of us had to get up, one of us had to stay behind to save our seats. \nFast forward and they call my name (I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m being taken back to a room) so we both get up. Once we pass through the doors the nurse tells me I\u2019m just going into that room to \u201cfinish triage\u201d- which I am assuming will be quick. So, I tell my boyfriend to wait in the waiting room and grab our seats. \nTriage takes longer than it honestly should have, but it\u2019s an ER, so what can you do? \nAnyways, I get a text from boyfriend saying he\u2019s going outside. Immediately after, I\u2019m told to go back to the waiting room, and I text and tell him I\u2019m back in the waiting room.\nHe comes in and is very obviously not happy with me. I\u2019m really confused because I have no idea what I did wrong. He tells me that he didn\u2019t like that I had him wait in the waiting area and how he felt like I didn\u2019t want him there. I attempted to explain my thinking- that triage was normally a quick thing and I knew they were sending us back out to the waiting room, and I thought we had wanted to not lose the comfy corner couch we had claimed. He wasn\u2019t hearing it, he was just not happy. A few minutes later my name was called to go back to a room, I got up, boyfriend did not. I asked if he was coming, and NOPE. He left me here.\n\nSo, here I am, ended up having to spend the night in the hospital to have surgery on my ear in the morning, and he left me here. \n\nAm I in the wrong for being absolutely pissed and ready to be done?", "created_utc": 1700288465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17y07nr/aita_boyfriend_got_mad_over_something_that_was_a/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's pissed at you for something that was outside of your control", "NTA. You're in the ER, about to have surgery, and he makes it about him. Hell naw. This was a simple relationship test, and he absolutely failed it.", "NTA.  Triage is so quick, and usually it\u2019s a fairly small space where a companion may get in the way.  Given the kind of injury you had, I expect that a nurse or doctor would have tried to separate you from each other at some point anyway - when a person comes in with an injury that looks like it probably came at another person\u2019s hands and their romantic partner is with them, it usually sets off alarm bells at the possibility that it might be abuse.  The fact that you separated yourself from him and still said it happened at work would have quieted that concern.  I have a genetic condition that makes me prone to stupid injuries, and it\u2019s absolutely routine for either the triage nurse, the attending doctor, or the ER nurse to get me away from my husband for a minute and let me know that they will help me if I am not safe at home.  No, doc, my husband doesn\u2019t hurt me, I\u2019m just a genetically fragile klutz, but thanks for checking.", "NTA. He clearly has a lot of growing up to do. Question for you is: do you want to stick around for that? How many potential emergencies will you have?

ER wait times are not something you can control, his not waiting to hear your diagnosis and treatment is problematic.\n\nHe is not prepared to support in an emergency.", "Nta- dump him", "It sounds like your boyfriend is very immature. To take offence at something like that when you are, the one who is clearly injured, then not even bothering to stay with you. NTA OP, it is your boyfriend. You are well to be done with him.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you should reconsider your relationship and who you are with.  No one loves waiting in a waiting room, but we make sacrifices for the people we love. Your bf revealed himself and his priorities to you.  When someone tells you who they are through their actions and words, believe them.", "NTA.  You\u2019d be nuts to let this slide.", "NTA. Your boyfriend was 100% in the wrong here.\n\nYou're about to join the police. You're going to be steeped in a culture of violence, abuse, hatred, and prejudice. People will intentionally beat a fearful, aggressive attitude into you, because they consider it a prerequisite for your job. If you're not cruel like they are, they will make every effort to push you out. You will not be given adequate training to be able to help people effectively and will be expected to figure it out yourself-- and if you can't figure it out on your own, you will be allowed and even encouraged to become fearful and reactive in situations where you don't know what to do. You will be pushed into hurting people and given no resources to help you resist that push; you'll have to figure out on your own how to fight against the tide.\n\nThe last thing you need is an unhealthy personal relationship. You're going to have to put active, conscious effort into making sure that you can maintain healthy personal relationships for the rest of your life, because your job is going to do its best to turn you into a terrible partner-- due to what you will witness, what you will be asked to do, and *who you will be asked to be*-- and *you must resist.* Starting out *having* a terrible partner is not a good way to start.", "NTA - seems like he just didn't want to be there in the first place, so he just picked a fight with you so he could go home.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour bf is the AH, what did he expect?", "NTA - milestone failed.

You are the one in pain, not him. Why would he drive separate?  I mean likely you wouldn't be able to drive yourself home after getting treated if they used any pain medication. Then, because he misunderstood, and refused to listen, HE LEAVES YOU THERE ALONE??  Yeah, I'd say OP you are NTA. Frankly if this is how he acts.... time to bounce.", "NTA. He's probably pissed that you're in the police academy and is being passive-aggressive about it.\n\nThere are better men out there.", "NTA - Given the circumstances, it seems like there was a misunderstanding and miscommunication in a stressful situation at the hospital. Triage processes can be unpredictable, and decisions made at the moment are often based on the information available at the time. It's clear that the intention was not to hurt or exclude the boyfriend but to manage the situation as best as possible. Emotions can definitely run high in emergency situations, and sometimes, frustrations are said without thought.", "ESH.  Triage is part of your care.  That\u2019s why her came there to be with you.  You should not have excluded him from it, even if you (erroneously) thought it would be quick.  You valued comfy chairs more than having him by your side.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
