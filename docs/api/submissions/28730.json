Ryan was all fucked up from the anesthesia and bled like a pig. Because I have him Wednesday through Saturday, he was going to stay at my house.\n\nI told his mom and her husband that I was taking him home as soon as he was cleared and they come by for 30 minutes and leave.

I'll give you 5 minutes to say goodbye and then leave.\n\nI went to throw away gauze and I overheard mt wife's husband tell my son he was going to get him into his pajamas and to the bathroom before they left.

Your ex and her hubs are _slow_.  It takes a lot of chutzpah to contradict you in your own home after you made yourself clear.  Twasn't any need for the two of them to linger about.", "She should have left step dad at home.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI wouldn't want her and her husband hanging out at my house either.", "NTA. You let them have a half hour with him and respected that time; they could have used that time to help your son get into his pajamas etc. during their time with him if they wanted to do all those things. Oral surgery is brutal and your kid needs to rest. You\u2019re just looking out for him.", "Nta. Honestly weird the stepdad was so insistent on changing the 11yos clothes. Maybe don't leave them alone, ever.", "NTA because what? I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone besides an at work medical professional or the other bio parent with changing and toileting my drugged child. Definitely not the step parent. that\u2019s even if your son and his stepdad have a good relationship from what you and your ex wife see.\n\nEdit) it is a nice gesture but I still wouldn\u2019t trust the stepdad to toilet my drugged child lol. Especially when I can do it. But I do think that maybe mom and stepdad could\u2019ve stayed a bit until the sedation or bleeding worn off a bit. Maybe just for peace of mind, because he did just get oral surgery.", "NTA. And that guy is creepy as hell.", "YTA.  I'm seeing all the N-T-As roll in but the truth is in the telling on this one.  Your son has just had probably the biggest surgery of his life at his age.  It's not an every day thing to go under general anaesthesia.  This is a big thing for you but also for his mother.  It would have cost you nothing to let them do that part of the bedtime routine yet you made a thing of it, seemingly to make a point.\n\nSo it ends up being \"Get the fuck out\" just because your son's own mother wants to change the gauze and they both want to get him into his pyjamas.  After such an event where they're not going to see him for a few days, a bit of extra time with him wouldn't kill you.  EVEN if it's just for them, let them have that.\n\nThere's so much petulance in the way you've written this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
