We also have a biological daughter, 13G. We live in a 3 bedroom house and at this time, it\u2019s not possible to add more room. We do plan on moving eventually but that\u2019s not something that will happen for a year minimum.\n\nOriginally, we were only receiving single placements but got our first sibling group in 10G and 15G. In our county, siblings can share a room, both bio and foster. The only condition is non-bio siblings of opposite sex can\u2019t share a room. Which isn\u2019t an issue here.\n\nWe try to do what we can to make the siblings comfortable. But recently 15G said at their home, she has her own room and she hates sharing. We\u2019ve tried to divide with curtains, privacy panels, etc. We\u2019ve let 15G get a lot of personalized stuff for her room. But it\u2019s a struggle. 15G has requested her own room.\n\nThe other issue is 13G set a boundary when we started fostering 2 years ago that she wouldn\u2019t share her room. We agreed as it seemed reasonable. She\u2019s always great with the other kids in our home but also deserves her own space where she can decompress. She went from being an only child to having other children in the home. We also make sure we get a lot of one on one time with her and still do stuff as a family. She knows she can talk to us about anything.\n\nWe did ask her about 10G sharing her room and obviously, she said no. We explained this to 15G and she is now upset, saying it\u2019s not fair. \n\nWe feel conflicted. Our social worker backs us up, but some people in our personal life say we are in the wrong. \n\nOther relevant info: We don\u2019t know exactly how long 15G and 10G will be with us but the current plan in place is 10 months minimum, with the likelihood it could be longer. So, it\u2019s not as if 10G and 13G would only share a room for a few weeks.\n\n\nEDIT because people are asking if 10G could sleep in the living room or whatever\u2026per guidelines, the children must live in a room with permanent walls, a door that closes, have their own dressers, etc. That would not be possible in the living room. \n\nI also cannot give up my room as it\u2019s stated that all living in the house must have rooms.  \n\nThe room is also big enough for the two. It is the house\u2019s master and fits all their stuff, plus leaves enough room for them to feel separate.", "created_utc": 1689257847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ym3l5/aita_for_not_giving_foster_daughter_her_own_room/", "score": 6684, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not gonna call a 15 years old an AH for wanting her own room, especially when her life has been upended.", "You are not wrong. You've made a promise to 13g, and imo it's important that you keep it. \n\nI sympathize with 15g, her hormones are probably all over the place, she cannot be in her own home, who knows *what* she's dealt with in previous homes/placements. It's got to be rough for her. I wish you didn't have to make this decision, but you are making the right decision. \n\nIt sounds like you're doing everything you can to make her more comfortable, to the best of your abilities. Hopefully this blows over soon, and who knows, if she's still with you if/when you can move to a bigger place, then she can have her own room.", "NAH.\n\nShe is not an AH!\n\nI do symathise with her! Being taken from your family is hard enough. \n\nBut you can only do what you are able to. Keep being understanding, but what isn't possible just isn't.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think the kid is an AH, but you are not by any means. \n\nIn other states, you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to have a foster child share a room with your bio child. I think a big part of that is for the sake of the kids. It would be unfair to ask your 13-year old to share her room with someone who is honestly a stranger. And it\u2019s unfair for a foster kid to have to share a room with a total stranger too. They already have to share a home. \n\nIt sucks to have to share a room with a sibling. I get that - I was thrilled when I finally got my own room as a kid. But I imagine the 15-year old will understand why with time, even if she never likes it. There isn\u2019t another room in the house. She\u2019s going to have to deal with it.", "Why would 15G be more entitled to her own room than the 13G?\n\nThat's the 13G home.

You need to stick to your promise to your bio daughter. She makes major life adjustments to help these kids. She deserves her own room.", "I am also a foster parent and my children said the same about sharing and I abide by that because in order for fostering to work, every one has to be on board. NTA", "NTA. You don't have enough rooms and can't do anything about it.", "NTA - You made an agreement with your bio daughter and you need to stick to it.", "NTA. You went into this having made a promise to your daughter. You benefit no-one by reneging on that. In fact, you set a stellar example for all the girls by keeping your promise. Good luck.", "NTA...The commitment you made your daughter is important and is likely key in maintaining harmony in your household. If your foster child cannot agree to share, their social worker will have to find them another placement.  You have one option for housing them, anything beyond that is not your issue to deal with.", "NTA- you need to stick to the promise you made to your daughter.", "NTA- You made an agreement with bio daughter before stating to foster. That doesn't suddenly change because foster daughter is upset about sharing. I feel bad for the foster daughter I do, but unless she wants to be placed in another home away from her sister so she can have her own room, she's going to have to suck it up.", "No-one is an AH here. \n\nOf course it's natural for a 15 year old to want her own room, especially when her life has had so much 'noise' already. \n\nUnfortunately that's just how it is. You made a solid deal with your daughter and there are no other configurations that will magic a new bedroom into existence. \n\nKeep sympathising with the 15 year old but keep gently reiterating that you won't break your word to your daughter, exactly the same way as you'll never break your word to her (your 15 year old).", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like a trauma response. It's a lot of emotional territory to navigate here and I sincerely wish you luck.", "NAH. It's understandable she wants her own room but it's just not an option right now. The only option left is to have her roll the dice and asked to be placed somewhere else separate from her sister and maybe she gets her own room then, Maybe she would have to share with more than just one girl.", "NTA - To be clear, 15g is not the AH either. The other people in your life who are not part of the situation but are passing judgment are the AHs. \n\nYou are in a tough situation and it sounds like you are doing the best you can. Of course both your 13g and 15g want their own rooms. I am sure 10g would like her own room also. I would imagine that in addition to the obvious desire to have her own space, 15g is probably also trying to test boundaries and exert some control over her environment. \n\nI know you can't make another space in your house a bedroom for 15, but can you find some space to make sort of a \"girl cave\"? Part of the basement that she can put some of her \"hang out stuff\" (books, decor, etc.) that is hers alone? Explain that she still has to sleep in the room with her sister, but that she can have private down time in this other area?", "NTA - 15 yo is right that it is \u201cnot fair\u201d to her but that is not your fault, it\u2019s her family\u2019s fault. Obviously you would not say that to her, but it may be her way of twisting the situation to blame you more than her own family.", "NAH, maybe talk with 15G about her privacy needs or any other concerns that may relate to her not wanting to share.\n13G probably needs consistency within a changeable home, and you also gave her your word.", "NAH.\n\nUnfortunately this is a no win situation. You absolutely cannot re-neg on your agreement with the 13yo. You will shatter her trust in you and that will cause huge problems down the road. My wife's mother did fostering when she was 12 and she's still very traumatized with how she got treated.\n\nThe 15yo isn't an AH for wanting her own room, but it's just not possible. The world gave her a rough hand and she's going to have to learn to deal. The only other options are to split the siblings into different homes (which may not be allowed by guidelines), or ask for them to be reassigned which is also awful and doesn't guarantee her a private room.\n\nI'm glad you're doing what you can to give them \"private\" spaces. But sharing a room isn't the end of the world. I survived sharing with three siblings.", "NAH. You only have what you have, but the 15 year old is not wrong that this isn\u2019t fair and she\u2019s entitled to her feelings. But you as the adult need to be ensuring that you do everything in your power to make sure this sucks less. And that means ensuring that the 15 year old also has alone time where the 10 year old is not there and they can decompress. And no them both being in their seperate areas of the same room does not count. It means taking the 10 year old out of the room to do activities, regularly. It is enforcing a knock policy, it is making sure the 10 year old isn\u2019t driving the 15 year old up the wall.\n\nEdit: To add there is not enough room for them to feel separate. The 15 year old has clearly told you she does not feel separate. I know you are doing your best but trying to invalidate her feelings isn\u2019t helping. Like I said the answer is making sure they have private time way from each other and you insisting that there is enough space to feel separate is giving you an out to not do that.", "NTA you have the space you have and it is what it is. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong and you should stick by your word to your bio daughter. \nJust as a thought, I turned my dining room into a bedroom.", "NaH but the answer is no to the 15. You\u2019re between a rock and a hard place but 15 needs to be the one that sucks it up. Is there a therapist to talk to her to try and soften the blow ? 13 is right to want her own space. You as adults are making a very nice choice to be foster parents, at 13 she doesn\u2019t get that choice and she\u2019s made one requirement which is fair in this situation. I see why the 15 year old feels that way but she needs to understand that sometimes life isn\u2019t fair. She should share with her own sister.", "Nobody sucks here. Unfortunately, the situation is as good as it can be for everyone involved.  You can't please all the people, all the time.", "NAH but i was a teenage foster kid, and it is HARD. i totally understand where she\u2019s coming from, she just wants some normalcy - and a 15yo sharing a room with a 10yo sibling would be incredibly difficult. a 5 year difference at that age is enormous. \nthis doesn\u2019t sound like an ideal placement for these girls personally, but another placement might also be traumatic - especially for the 10yo. the less moving around the better, ideally. \noutside of moving, this is just going to be a tough placement - hopefully your daughter bonds with the 10yo and sees how fun siblings can be, and wants to share a room - which could happen! but i wouldn\u2019t force the issue, as you already made that agreement.\n\nbut please never forget how tough this is on your fosters. do everything you can to make this easier on them.", "NTA, but this doesn't sound like a good foster placement and it might be worth looking at a new placement for them.", "How big is the room your foster daughters are sharing? \n\n\n\nIf it's big enough, you could make it a fun and creative project as a family to build bunk bed/room dividers. Basically the bunk beds are in the centre of the room,   check them out online, DIY bunk beds room divider, you could suggest looking at ways with both sisters to divide their room that suit their needs/tastes, and then making a fun project out of it.\n\n\nAnd not the asshole. You're in a difficult situation, between a rock and a hard place. Both teenagers want to  have their own rooms, but in a 3 bedroom house, two of the three girls are going to end up having to share.", "NTA. Respect the discussion you had with your bio child. I am 10 years older than my siblings and when my brother and sister became to old to share a room, I was a teenager. I hated it but I had to share a room with my under 10yo sister during highschool. As a grown up I know why I had to suck it up. Even then I kind of got it despite my self righteous teenage brain. Unfortunately this 15yo is learning that not everything goes her way.\n\nEdit to add: I understand that this child is in foster care and that she\u2019s already had the shit end of the stick. I can admit my phrasing of the last sentence could be wrong. My main point is that OP needs to ensure that her relationship with her bio child doesn\u2019t suffer due to fostering. If an agreement was made before the foster children entered the home it should be followed through or her child may build some resentment towards that. When this foster child grows up and looks back I\u2019m sure sharing a room with her sister in a loving home will not be her biggest hold up.\n\nEdited again for technicality\u2026.OP is not the asshole and neither is the teenager. NAH", "INFO: I thought foster kids need to have their own rooms? Or is it just highly recommended?", "NAH, good for you for sticking with your agreement with your bio daughter\n\nCould you divide your living room / another room of the house to give the 10yo a \u201cprivate\u201d room and then let the 15yo have their own room?", "Nta. Its just life. Do what you can and if you ended up adopting maybe then a permanent situation could be found (like converting master bedroom into 2 small rooms by adding a wall)", "NTA. Your daughter put up a boundary, and you should continue to respect it. I feel for the other two kids because of the upheaval in their lives, but they can share the room. Your caseworker has your back, so continue to love them and take care of them. I think what you are doing is great. Your daughter also has the right to a stable life, and she needs her room to decompress and have something private and 'just her's'.", "NAH. \n\nThe foster kids aren't AH's for wanting their own space, and your daughter and you are not for ensuring her boundaries are respected. \n\nThis is not an easy situation, I'm sorry OP.", "NAH.  I work with foster kids. People like you are a blessing in communities.  This is an extremely difficult time on the children and a hard time on your family too.  Explain this issue to the children\u2019s counselor. Also, perhaps share with the 15 year old how much you recognize the importance of a single room, but that you also recognize that her bind with her sister is more important than a single room, which is why you opened your house to both of them.", "NAH. I get why 15 doesn't want to share. I really do. But this is the reality unfortunately.\n\nYou can use room deviders to create the illusion of two seperate rooms in their bedroom, but that is the best you can probably do. \n\nYour agreement with 13 is far more important. Why? She needs to be on board with the fostering too to keep the harmony in the home good enough to do so. She agreed to your family fostering, on that one term. She wouldn't have to share her room. You really need to honor that agreement.", "The younger girl would be best served by sharing with her sister.  There\u2019s a lot of concern here for the 15 yo, but her sister is equally displaced and I wonder how she would feel being left with a strange girl, even if your daughter was ok with it. \n\nYou have done the best thing for them.

But do try not to get sibling fosters unless they are okay with sharing a room, next time", "NTA.  15G cannot say it\u2019s unfair.  Someone has to share, it obviously should be the two sisters.  Maybe this placement isn\u2019t ideal for anyone at this point, as 15G may cause problems with resenting your daughter.", "NAH: Maybe if you have a tv/living room, make a quiet area for 15.

I think this is where it's so important to make sure everyone in the home is on board with fostering. You don't have enough rooms to keep everyone happy; there's not a lot you can do about this.

Because a ten and a 15 year old in the same room? But your bio child gets her own room. I don't blame the 15 year old for being upset. It's one thing to share a room on an overnight or short term placement but this sounds like a more permanent lengthy stay Figure something else out. Give up your room. Sleep in the fkupoing couch. Or out all 3 girls in the largest bedroom. Put the 2 older girls together and let the little have her own room (because being younger she probably has an earlier bedtime, toys etc) Just because they are fosters they don't be deserved to be treated like 2nd class citizens who should be grateful for the crumbs off your family's table.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get where the foster daughter is coming from, but it\u2019s not fair to your daughter to have to give up her room when it\u2019s her steady home.

That\u2019s BS to put your child in that position. And it\u2019s not healthy for anyone to allow a 15 year old to come into your home and dictate it. \n\nSo you have a situation with three girls where two of them have to share a room.

It's honestly really important for your own permanent members of the household to not feel pushed aside during that process-- and most foster kids are high-needs to some level just due to being in the system inherently, so making sure the kid knows they'll never lose their room is a *good promise to make*. \n\nIs it fair to the bio kid to share with a girl for 10 months and then have that girl move out and then maybe end up with another girl sharing her room for 10 months and so on?

That makes the most sense instead of having one of them share a room with someone who is essentially a stranger. Not to mention, sharing rooms is MORE THAN FINE. Not having the same amount of rooms as kids is not abuse, neglect, or anything else. Sometimes sharing a room with a sibling is just a part of life.

Also, OP stated they're been fostering for two years now, and have mentioned multiple places in their home. It makes me think they're doing short term or \"emergency\" foster care.

Having to adapt to a younger bio sibling and losing your family and ending up in the system are going to create entirely different feelings in a kid. You were being bratty, which is normal for a kid that age, please don't take this as a jab.

One suffered a debilitating injury in foster care that has left him disabled for life, but it was genuinely an accident and we never blamed the foster-family.\n\n  \nThat said, these kids know they aren't  on equal footing with the bio-kids or permanent members of the family.

I'm not trying to be rude, but it is what it is. \n\nOP, you have been great with your foster daughters. You have accommodated their wants and needs and went out of your way to make them feel welcome. You can't change the size of your house though. Your daughter definitely needs her own space that she has control over.

I mean 13 y/o change their minds often enough that it's not ridiculous to believe they may have changed their feelings on the matter so there's nothing wrong with checking in to see as long as op wasn't framing as \"you really should do this or else everyone will be upset and it'd be because you don't want to share\"", "Asking about sharing a room with a future theoretical kid is a lot different than asking if they'll share with this specific kid.\n\nIf OP is TA or not totally depends on how 13G was asked.", "Thank you!

Familial connection is how we learn most life skills, and these children currently have no family to guide them.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying OP is doing this.

That\u2019s real family, what are they going to do? Put their own kid up to be fostered?", "Loved, cared, included and wanted, yes. But you need to set firm boundaries there as well and manage your own behaviors because you have to remember that the primary goal of the foster care program is reunification with bio parents. making sure we treat them with whole, loving, caring compassionate behaviors, should be encouraged, but not to the point where the foster child sees you as a replacement family. The foster parents should be working with the Social services towards reunification. thats the responsibility of the foster parent. Provide a safe, loving home, while also reinforcing reuinification. \n\nPeople have this hollywood vision of foster care as being either this horrible situation where kids are neglected and abused (very real thing that happens) OR this Hallmark movie of fosters who become the perfect replacement parents for a traumatized child. When the reality is that Fostering is about providing a safe home for the child while the bioparent or family fixes their life/situation/whatever to become a suitable home for the kid. \n\nYou do not want to create a \"real parent child\" relationship with a foster beacuse what you are ultimately creating is future trauma for that child because more than likely, they will go back home to their bio parents because that is the goal. foster parents need to toe the line of creating enough emotional distance so that the child is not as severely traumatized during the reunification process while also providing care and emotional support to help grow this child into an emotionally healthy adult.", "That\u2019s quite a leap there.

Quite a leap, no?", "They DO have parents. They had a home until whatever happened that caused them to be placed in foster care.

OP said it was really hard for the pair to find a placement at all. As much as it sucks - I've been a teenage girl desperate for privacy, too - this is their best option. It's a privileged position to call that a \"cardinal rule.\"\n\nETA: I'm not calling the foster girls privileged, I'm speaking on anyone in the \"foster community\" who judges someone doing their best to help children who need it because of a \"cardinal rule\" to have multiple free bedrooms in a country/world where many people struggle to have enough space for themselves.", "I would agree with that but it seems the alternative is to split bio sisters.

I don\u2019t know the country OP is in but in UK there is a massive shortage of foster placements. Whilst sharing a room might not be ideal, for what is always a temporary solution you might be letting the best be the enemy of the good - we don\u2019t know what situation these girls are being removed and protected from and sharing a room is likely a small price to be paid if there aren\u2019t any better alternative placements available.\n\nThe other option is splitting the siblings to separate placements but that doesn\u2019t necessarily have good outcomes either.\n\nOne assumes there wasn\u2019t a better arrangement available when the placement was made.", "Yeah. Maybe the 15G should be homeless until they have another place to stay.", "Depends on what the alternative is. If it\u2019s this or a worse place, it\u2019s good that they are fostering her.

It's the parents jobs to help her understand all the considerations but I don't think she's being entitled.

She feels abandoned by her biological family and she probably feels like her needs are deprioritized so she's asserting that she wants to have one of her needs to be the priority... At least I think this is one thing that might be going on psychologically subconsciously.

A lock easily solved that problem.", "Foster kids can request different placements. We had one kid that came to us that way. There were some things in a previous home that made them uncomfortable and they requested to be moved. We made it clear that our only available bed was in a 12 year old (also foster child) room and we made sure both kids were okay with the situation before accepting placement.\n\nThe caseworker can say no if they feel it is a valid reason (like being mad that they are asked to keep their room straightened). and yes, homes for teens are much harder to find. They are more likely to spend time in group homes and shelters as most people want to take in younger kids.", "Well, it was hard because my sister and I shared a room and she was younger and around the same age as a few of the daycare kids. So, she inevitably ended up playing with them when they were there. She knew they weren\u2019t supposed to be in our room, but of course being a kid, would invite them in to play with her stuff.", "You are such a thoughtful, well-spoken person. I agree with everything you said here. Thank you for posting it.", "Can you explain what you mean by the importance of maintaining \u201cbirth order\u201d? Sorry, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m familiar with. Like what does that look like and in what situations? \n\nIs it related to parents adopting multiple kids but maybe they adopt an infant first and then later adopt a 9 year old but the first adopted kid is still younger?", "It\u2019s about having natural differences in responsibilities and privileges that are based on age. So, if there\u2019s two bedrooms for 3 kids, the youngest two share a room. The other two will get their own rooms when the oldest moves out. A 17 year old will have more chores than a three year old but perhaps the 17 year old might have their own phone.", "From what I heard the the couples discussing it, they say that you should always adopt in a manner that doesn\u2019t change the children\u2019s identity/order/rank so to speak.  In this situation, they already had a 13 year old, she already identified as the oldest child in that family.  If they adopt a child, it should be one less than 13 so as not to \u201cdemote\u201d for lack of a better word, they child they already had.  It would be no different if they had adopted the 13 year old first.  She\u2019d still have established herself within the family as the oldest child.  I\u2019m not doing very well explaining this.  \n\nIn your example, if they started out adopting an infant, no they shouldn\u2019t adopt a 9 year old later.  If they adopted the 9 year old first instead, then adopting the infant afterwards would be fine.", "Maybe I worded it wrong but I meant how it relates to adoption and how it would apply in situations with adopted kids\n\nLike, are agencies stressing this importance when a family with an adopted 4 year old is going through the process of adopting another 10 year old. Just curious about the intricacies of adoption and what it looks like when birth order is/isn\u2019t followed", "This is great advice!", "I hate hate hate hate this idea that children in horrible circumstances should be \u201cgrateful\u201d for anything. \n\nTheir whole lives have been upended. No, they don\u2019t need to be grateful. They are absolutely allowed to feel anxious, miserable, stressed, disappointed, etc. It\u2019s a shit situation for her, she gets to be upset, even though sure, \u201cit could be worse.\u201d", "This", "Genuinely curious, how is having some cabinets in an open basement more \"yours\" than have your own half of the room with a divider up?", "I know teenagers don't think this way, but you'd imagine that the 15 year old would be grateful that she's housed with her little sister. Sharing a room should be the least of her worries; at least she knows her little sis is as safe as she is.", "Good point, then it might be even more useful to talk that through and recognise that the wish is absolutely valid. In couple therapy they say that it\u2019s important to validate each others feelings as you feel more valued, even if you can\u2019t change the situation. And I read a similar thing in a really good negotiation book.", "She must feel safe to complain about sharing a room.", "At least in my family, the oldest doesn't always get their own room. They're are more factors than just age. Sure, in this family they're all girls so that creates more options. But my dad's the middle child but only boy, so he had his own room. When my youngest was born, he had his own room and the older 2 shared so he didn't disrupt their sleep. My FIL is only 2 years younger than his older brother but 6 years older than his younger brother, so the older 2 shared a room."]}
