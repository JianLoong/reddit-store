We also have a biological daughter, 13G. We live in a 3 bedroom house and at this time, it\u2019s not possible to add more room. We do plan on moving eventually but that\u2019s not something that will happen for a year minimum.\n\nOriginally, we were only receiving single placements but got our first sibling group in 10G and 15G. In our county, siblings can share a room, both bio and foster. The only condition is non-bio siblings of opposite sex can\u2019t share a room. Which isn\u2019t an issue here.\n\nWe try to do what we can to make the siblings comfortable. But recently 15G said at their home, she has her own room and she hates sharing. We\u2019ve tried to divide with curtains, privacy panels, etc. We\u2019ve let 15G get a lot of personalized stuff for her room. But it\u2019s a struggle. 15G has requested her own room.\n\nThe other issue is 13G set a boundary when we started fostering 2 years ago that she wouldn\u2019t share her room. We agreed as it seemed reasonable. She\u2019s always great with the other kids in our home but also deserves her own space where she can decompress. She went from being an only child to having other children in the home. We also make sure we get a lot of one on one time with her and still do stuff as a family. She knows she can talk to us about anything.\n\nWe did ask her about 10G sharing her room and obviously, she said no. We explained this to 15G and she is now upset, saying it\u2019s not fair. \n\nWe feel conflicted. Our social worker backs us up, but some people in our personal life say we are in the wrong. \n\nOther relevant info: We don\u2019t know exactly how long 15G and 10G will be with us but the current plan in place is 10 months minimum, with the likelihood it could be longer. So, it\u2019s not as if 10G and 13G would only share a room for a few weeks.\n\n\nEDIT because people are asking if 10G could sleep in the living room or whatever\u2026per guidelines, the children must live in a room with permanent walls, a door that closes, have their own dressers, etc. That would not be possible in the living room. \n\nI also cannot give up my room as it\u2019s stated that all living in the house must have rooms.  \n\nThe room is also big enough for the two. It is the house\u2019s master and fits all their stuff, plus leaves enough room for them to feel separate.", "created_utc": 1689257847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ym3l5/aita_for_not_giving_foster_daughter_her_own_room/", "score": 672, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not gonna call a 15 years old an AH for wanting her own room, especially when her life has been upended.", "You are not wrong. You've made a promise to 13g, and imo it's important that you keep it. \n\nI sympathize with 15g, her hormones are probably all over the place, she cannot be in her own home, who knows *what* she's dealt with in previous homes/placements. It's got to be rough for her. I wish you didn't have to make this decision, but you are making the right decision. \n\nIt sounds like you're doing everything you can to make her more comfortable, to the best of your abilities. Hopefully this blows over soon, and who knows, if she's still with you if/when you can move to a bigger place, then she can have her own room.", "NAH.\n\nShe is not an AH!\n\nI do symathise with her! Being taken from your family is hard enough. \n\nBut you can only do what you are able to. Keep being understanding, but what isn't possible just isn't.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think the kid is an AH, but you are not by any means. \n\nIn other states, you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to have a foster child share a room with your bio child. I think a big part of that is for the sake of the kids. It would be unfair to ask your 13-year old to share her room with someone who is honestly a stranger. And it\u2019s unfair for a foster kid to have to share a room with a total stranger too. They already have to share a home. \n\nIt sucks to have to share a room with a sibling. I get that - I was thrilled when I finally got my own room as a kid. But I imagine the 15-year old will understand why with time, even if she never likes it. There isn\u2019t another room in the house. She\u2019s going to have to deal with it.", "Why would 15G be more entitled to her own room than the 13G?\n\nThat's the 13G home.

You need to stick to your promise to your bio daughter. She makes major life adjustments to help these kids.

You went into this having made a promise to your daughter. You benefit no-one by reneging on that. In fact, you set a stellar example for all the girls by keeping your promise. Good luck.", "NTA...The commitment you made your daughter is important and is likely key in maintaining harmony in your household. If your foster child cannot agree to share, their social worker will have to find them another placement.  You have one option for housing them, anything beyond that is not your issue to deal with.", "NTA- you need to stick to the promise you made to your daughter.", "NTA- You made an agreement with bio daughter before stating to foster. That doesn't suddenly change because foster daughter is upset about sharing. I feel bad for the foster daughter I do, but unless she wants to be placed in another home away from her sister so she can have her own room, she's going to have to suck it up.", "No-one is an AH here. \n\nOf course it's natural for a 15 year old to want her own room, especially when her life has had so much 'noise' already. \n\nUnfortunately that's just how it is. You made a solid deal with your daughter and there are no other configurations that will magic a new bedroom into existence. \n\nKeep sympathising with the 15 year old but keep gently reiterating that you won't break your word to your daughter, exactly the same way as you'll never break your word to her (your 15 year old).", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like a trauma response. It's a lot of emotional territory to navigate here and I sincerely wish you luck.", "NAH. It's understandable she wants her own room but it's just not an option right now. The only option left is to have her roll the dice and asked to be placed somewhere else separate from her sister and maybe she gets her own room then, Maybe she would have to share with more than just one girl.", "NTA - To be clear, 15g is not the AH either. The other people in your life who are not part of the situation but are passing judgment are the AHs. \n\nYou are in a tough situation and it sounds like you are doing the best you can. Of course both your 13g and 15g want their own rooms. I am sure 10g would like her own room also. I would imagine that in addition to the obvious desire to have her own space, 15g is probably also trying to test boundaries and exert some control over her environment. \n\nI know you can't make another space in your house a bedroom for 15, but can you find some space to make sort of a \"girl cave\"? Part of the basement that she can put some of her \"hang out stuff\" (books, decor, etc.) that is hers alone? Explain that she still has to sleep in the room with her sister, but that she can have private down time in this other area?", "NTA - 15 yo is right that it is \u201cnot fair\u201d to her but that is not your fault, it\u2019s her family\u2019s fault. Obviously you would not say that to her, but it may be her way of twisting the situation to blame you more than her own family.", "NAH, maybe talk with 15G about her privacy needs or any other concerns that may relate to her not wanting to share.\n13G probably needs consistency within a changeable home, and you also gave her your word.", "NAH.\n\nUnfortunately this is a no win situation. You absolutely cannot re-neg on your agreement with the 13yo. You will shatter her trust in you and that will cause huge problems down the road. My wife's mother did fostering when she was 12 and she's still very traumatized with how she got treated.\n\nThe 15yo isn't an AH for wanting her own room, but it's just not possible. The world gave her a rough hand and she's going to have to learn to deal. The only other options are to split the siblings into different homes (which may not be allowed by guidelines), or ask for them to be reassigned which is also awful and doesn't guarantee her a private room.\n\nI'm glad you're doing what you can to give them \"private\" spaces. But sharing a room isn't the end of the world. I survived sharing with three siblings.", "NAH. You only have what you have, but the 15 year old is not wrong that this isn\u2019t fair and she\u2019s entitled to her feelings. But you as the adult need to be ensuring that you do everything in your power to make sure this sucks less. And that means ensuring that the 15 year old also has alone time where the 10 year old is not there and they can decompress. And no them both being in their seperate areas of the same room does not count. It means taking the 10 year old out of the room to do activities, regularly. It is enforcing a knock policy, it is making sure the 10 year old isn\u2019t driving the 15 year old up the wall.", "NTA you have the space you have and it is what it is. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong and you should stick by your word to your bio daughter. \nJust as a thought, I turned my dining room into a bedroom.", "NaH but the answer is no to the 15. You\u2019re between a rock and a hard place but 15 needs to be the one that sucks it up. Is there a therapist to talk to her to try and soften the blow ? 13 is right to want her own space. You as adults are making a very nice choice to be foster parents, at 13 she doesn\u2019t get that choice and she\u2019s made one requirement which is fair in this situation. I see why the 15 year old feels that way but she needs to understand that sometimes life isn\u2019t fair. She should share with her own sister.", "Nobody sucks here. Unfortunately, the situation is as good as it can be for everyone involved.  You can't please all the people, all the time.", "NAH but i was a teenage foster kid, and it is HARD. i totally understand where she\u2019s coming from, she just wants some normalcy - and a 15yo sharing a room with a 10yo sibling would be incredibly difficult. a 5 year difference at that age is enormous. \nthis doesn\u2019t sound like an ideal placement for these girls personally, but another placement might also be traumatic - especially for the 10yo. the less moving around the better, ideally. \noutside of moving, this is just going to be a tough placement - hopefully your daughter bonds with the 10yo and sees how fun siblings can be, and wants to share a room - which could happen! but i wouldn\u2019t force the issue, as you already made that agreement.\n\nbut please never forget how tough this is on your fosters. do everything you can to make this easier on them.", "NTA, but this doesn't sound like a good foster placement and it might be worth looking at a new placement for them.", "How big is the room your foster daughters are sharing? \n\n\n\nIf it's big enough, you could make it a fun and creative project as a family to build bunk bed/room dividers. Basically the bunk beds are in the centre of the room,   check them out online, DIY bunk beds room divider, you could suggest looking at ways with both sisters to divide their room that suit their needs/tastes, and then making a fun project out of it.\n\n\nAnd not the asshole. You're in a difficult situation, between a rock and a hard place. Both teenagers want to  have their own rooms, but in a 3 bedroom house, two of the three girls are going to end up having to share.", "NTA. Respect the discussion you had with your bio child. I am 10 years older than my siblings and when my brother and sister became to old to share a room, I was a teenager. I hated it but I had to share a room with my under 10yo sister during highschool. As a grown up I know why I had to suck it up. Even then I kind of got it despite my self righteous teenage brain. Unfortunately this 15yo is learning that not everything goes her way.", "INFO: I thought foster kids need to have their own rooms? Or is it just highly recommended?", "NAH, good for you for sticking with your agreement with your bio daughter\n\nCould you divide your living room / another room of the house to give the 10yo a \u201cprivate\u201d room and then let the 15yo have their own room?", "Nta. Its just life. Do what you can and if you ended up adopting maybe then a permanent situation could be found (like converting master bedroom into 2 small rooms by adding a wall)", "NTA. Your daughter put up a boundary, and you should continue to respect it. I feel for the other two kids because of the upheaval in their lives, but they can share the room. Your caseworker has your back, so continue to love them and take care of them. I think what you are doing is great. Your daughter also has the right to a stable life, and she needs her room to decompress and have something private and 'just her's'.", "NAH. \n\nThe foster kids aren't AH's for wanting their own space, and your daughter and you are not for ensuring her boundaries are respected. \n\nThis is not an easy situation, I'm sorry OP.", "NAH.  I work with foster kids. People like you are a blessing in communities.  This is an extremely difficult time on the children and a hard time on your family too.  Explain this issue to the children\u2019s counselor. Also, perhaps share with the 15 year old how much you recognize the importance of a single room, but that you also recognize that her bind with her sister is more important than a single room, which is why you opened your house to both of them.", "NAH. I get why 15 doesn't want to share. I really do. But this is the reality unfortunately.\n\nYou can use room deviders to create the illusion of two seperate rooms in their bedroom, but that is the best you can probably do. \n\nYour agreement with 13 is far more important. Why? She needs to be on board with the fostering too to keep the harmony in the home good enough to do so. She agreed to your family fostering, on that one term. She wouldn't have to share her room. You really need to honor that agreement.", "The younger girl would be best served by sharing with her sister.  There\u2019s a lot of concern here for the 15 yo, but her sister is equally displaced and I wonder how she would feel being left with a strange girl, even if your daughter was ok with it. \n\nYou have done the best thing for them. Trust in your parenting ability.", "NAH, you had an agreement with your daughter. But do try not to get sibling fosters unless they are okay with sharing a room, next time", "NTA.  15G cannot say it\u2019s unfair.  Someone has to share, it obviously should be the two sisters.  Maybe this placement isn\u2019t ideal for anyone at this point, as 15G may cause problems with resenting your daughter.", "NAH: Maybe if you have a tv/living room, make a quiet area for 15. She\u2019ll still have the permanent bedroom which will keep the conditions for fostering met but have some space. Make it a rule that if she is there, she\u2019s not to be bothered unless it\u2019s important.", "NTA - time to buy a bedroom divider for 15 and 10 :)", "NAH. I think this is where it's so important to make sure everyone in the home is on board with fostering. You don't have enough rooms to keep everyone happy; there's not a lot you can do about this.

It's your decision. Don't put this on your daughter. You have to make the decision.

Because a ten and a 15 year old in the same room? But your bio child gets her own room. I don't blame the 15 year old for being upset. It's one thing to share a room on an overnight or short term placement but this sounds like a more permanent lengthy stay Figure something else out. Give up your room. Sleep in the fkupoing couch. Or out all 3 girls in the largest bedroom. Put the 2 older girls together and let the little have her own room (because being younger she probably has an earlier bedtime, toys etc) Just because they are fosters they don't be deserved to be treated like 2nd class citizens who should be grateful for the crumbs off your family's table.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get where the foster daughter is coming from, but it\u2019s not fair to your daughter to have to give up her room when it\u2019s her steady home.

No. But uprooting your daughter\u2019s life more than it already has been would not be fair when you made the deal with her.

And they're being fostered, not adopted-- when there's bio or adopted children in the home while you're *fostering* (with the intent of reunification, not adoption), that means the children will be in your home on a temporary basis. It's honestly really important for your own permanent members of the household to not feel pushed aside during that process-- and most foster kids are high-needs to some level just due to being in the system inherently, so making sure the kid knows they'll never lose their room is a *good promise to make*. \n\nIs it fair to the bio kid to share with a girl for 10 months and then have that girl move out and then maybe end up with another girl sharing her room for 10 months and so on? Of course not. Permanent children of the house should have a permanent room situation that doesn't get shuffled around when fosters come and go. That means no coming and going roommates.", "It\u2019s different because they are there in a temporary basis. OP had an agreement with her daughter for her to keep her room. This prevents the daughter from being shuffled around every time another foster child comes to live with them. And the foster siblings *should* share a room. That makes the most sense instead of having one of them share a room with someone who is essentially a stranger. Not to mention, sharing rooms is MORE THAN FINE. Not having the same amount of rooms as kids is not abuse, neglect, or anything else. Sometimes sharing a room with a sibling is just a part of life.

Regardless of whether they are bio/foster.", "You\u2019re not TA in that you can\u2019t produce a room you don\u2019t have out of nowhere, but it\u2019s going to be clear to any sibling pairs you foster that your bio child will always be favoured if they have to share rooms and she doesn\u2019t ever. If that\u2019s fine with you, then go for it. But this seems kind of close to \u201cyou should be lucky that you have this room, obviously we made a promise to our bio kid that we can\u2019t break\u201d which I don\u2019t think is a good attitude to foster with. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to adjust anything for this specific scenario, since that doesn\u2019t seem likely, but maybe something to consider for future placements.", "You are doing fine mama. Don\u2019t listen to the naysayers.", "Agree to disagree there. The whole \"these foster kids should be GRATEFUL they even have a place to stay\" doesn't sit right with me. If bio kid gets a room, foster kids should too, imho.", "It is though when one child is being given benefits that others aren't receiving and it just so happens that the child receiving benefits is the bio child.\n\nReally its OPs mistake for taking on two foster kids. Not the fault of the bio child. If OP wanted to keep their commitment with their bio child then he shouldn't have taken on 2 kids. But now what's done is done and OP has to bite the bullet with his bio daughter and make things right with the foster kids.", "I get the Teens don't want to share...all teens want their own  space. But by making the 15 year old share but not the 13 year old you are reinforcing to the 15 year old that she does not belong and that the happiness of the 13 year old is more important to you. So either make them Both equally unhappy or do a game or competition or draw straws...something that is not you choosing to favour your bio child.", "OP has an obligation to please 13G though, I\u2019m both the biological sense and the promise that was made. She has to come first, it\u2019s really that simple in my mind. Fostering is great and it\u2019s an amazingly good deed but it shouldn\u2019t be done at the direct expense of one\u2019s own.", "Exactly!!!", "I could not agree more.", "So we should be nicer to the kid who is having to deal with a very unstable family life and the fear of where she will be sent next maybe? The 13 yr old would supposedly only have to make the sacrifice on a temporary basis and she has a permanent home unlike the other kid, which is quite the privilege she should learn to appreciate.", "No one said that. But saying its not 15 yos home too is just false, they chose to bring her in and are getting paid to house her.  \n\n\nBut again literally nowhere in that sentence did it say to kick the 13 yo out.  \nShitty situation, NAH because from the sound of \"at their home\" this may be a recent thing,  of course a teenager is going to struggle with such a huge change, but OP is right to keep the promise to the 13 y.o", "> We\u2019ve tried to divide with curtains, privacy panels, etc.", "OP already said they tried that", "They would also need to install egress windows and a separate closet into each half. It has to be completely permanent bedrooms for foster care.", ">would't be destructive if you wanted to take it down later and leave the rest of the room in tact\n\nYes it absolutely would - they'd have to anchor it to ceiling and floor for that wall to be stable, especially if they need the approval of the government and social worker (and building code). Beyond that, there's presumably currently only one door to the master bedroom...the only way to divide that room in two is to either a) cut a hole in an existing wall to add a second door to the new room, or b) have one bedroom only accessible by literally walking through the other bedroom.", "Are we really at the point of saying that siblings can't share rooms? Plenty of bio kids share rooms their whole childhoods and that's sufficiently satisfying parents obligation to provide their children rooms. \n\nOf course they can still take them!\n\nNo one is an AH here. What I would promise the 15 year old is that if circumstances change (eg they do end up moving), you will do everything in your power to make sure she has her own room or at least her own space... Be careful not to promise it beyond what you can really do but you can promise to make your absolute best effort.", "This is such a good idea. Kids in foster care have so little control over their lives and what\u2019s happening to them. Giving her a space to just be that\u2019s hers might go a long way in meeting her need and satisfying her desire to be heard/understood.", "Again, I am astounded at the complete ignorance here. Do you think that foster kids have some sort of plethora of options of where to live? That it's like choosing a hotel? That there are just an endless number of safe, loving foster homes available to sibling groups (especially ones that include a teenager), so they can just say, \"Oh no, I don't want to live there . . . it doesn't suit my needs\". \n\nWhat planet are you living on?\n\nThe alternative to sharing a room with her sibling is not going to a different foster home where she gets offered her very own room. More likely, the other option is for the siblings to be SPLIT UP and put in separate foster homes . . . and possibly for the teen to end up in a group home, where she will be sharing a room with possibly several complete strangers, instead of just her own younger bio sister. \n\nThe foster system is a nightmare. These kids were LUCKY to have landed in a caring, supportive home where the worst thing is that they are dealing with the same thing that many bio kids have to: sharing a room because there just aren't enough to go around. Suggesting that foster parents should decline to take in kids who have nowhere to go because they can't provide some sort of ideal situation is insane. The kids are safe, cared for, and will not be abused or neglected. That's what matters.", "I\u2019m going to keep taking sibling groups. Do you know what happens when people have an attitude like yours? Siblings are split up.\n\nWhile 15G isn\u2019t happy\u2026she\u2019d rather have to share a room vs not live with her sister at all.", "You think OP should take away a loving foster home for potentially dozens of kids over the course of her life, in a world where there is already a shortage of foster homes and siblings are routinely split up, because social services might tell her she needs to have two siblings share a bedroom once in a while? What?", "There isn\u2019t an abundance in foster families.  OP is beyond amazing for taking in two older children. Teens especially can be hard to find homes for. OP is making a positive difference in these girls lives.", "Ah, but it's not that easy to find good people wiling to foster, and OP sounds like one of the good ones.", "I hate to call a foster kid entitled, after I can only imagine the circumstances they've been through, but my God. Her and her sister get to stay together, in a safe home, with someone who obviously is trying very hard and cares for them. Now she's trying to push your daughter, who's lived in their room for their whole life, out of her space? \nYour daughter is making a sacrifice by sharing her family and home at a pivotal time in her development. She had 1 boundary.", "Yup I do agree with this. Life is not all sunshine where you get what you ask for. Personally I don\u2019t mind sharing a room if I get to live with my sister in a normal enough house- my expectation for foster home is no abuse and everything else I can handle. That being said- 15/16 yo is really young and doesn\u2019t understand how the cruel the world can be", "Social services is known to not give a shit about the kids. You need to stop fostering because clearly you don't either. \n\nI'm a former foster child. Sure, being separated would be worse than not having your own room *but that doesn't mean you use that to invalidate a kid's feelings*. You need to pass this group to someone else because clearly you are not able to meet their needs. Foster children are going through a lot, more than you'll ever understand. Sometimes their own room is all they can have for themselves. They're away from their families and in a strange home and you want to play \"well other sibling groups have it worse so suck it up\". That's not cool. \n\nAnd for everyone here saying you don't understand what it's like to be a foster child, shove it up yours. I do. I was there. You don't need to act like this.", "Social services is \\*never\\* going to ask siblings if they 'agree to share'. Do you understand that?", "this is possibly the best home they will be in. they have a big house and a loving family, they have tried dividing the room and the 15 year old just is not happy. OP made a promise to her daughter to keep, these are foster kids and being told no should be enough for them.", "Her bio child who lives there permanently SHOULD be \"favored\" by having her own room. She lives there permanently. Her room shouldn't be upended for temporary situations.", "Fucking exactly, everyone who is pushing back against comments like this don't get it. I was a foster child. Shit like this *isn't* fair. It absolutely will affect them.", "They did make a promise to their child that they shouldn\u2019t break. Having other kids come in to her home and take up her parents time and attention can\u2019t be easy for her. She deserves to have her space.", "Nobody said that. Two siblings sharing a big room IS adequate space, they have dividers, all of their stuff fits in the room with space left over, they\u2019re allowed to decorate however they want. This is an adequate living space, they have a room, they have privacy.", "Not really, the foster children are siblings so it would make more sense to house them together then for the bio kid to be housed with someone who isn\u2019t their sibling.", "But I really don\u2019t understand how making the teens share will solve anything. Really not trying to be argumentative.\n\n15 year old wants her own room. She isn\u2019t happy sharing with her sister. She\u2019ll be equally unhappy-perhaps more-sharing it with my 13 year old. That doesn\u2019t solve the issue of her being unhappy. It just basically makes both girls miserable in the interest of \u201cbeing fair\u201d.\n\nThen 10 year old will have her own room, something she doesn\u2019t even care about. It really makes no sense.\n\nI do think the only 2 options are: 15G and 10G share a room while 13G gets her own. OR 15G gets her own room while 13G and 10G share.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, someone is unhappy.", "NTA - To be clear, 15g is not the AH either. The other people in your life who are not part of the situation but are passing judgment are the AHs.", "Yeah, I\u2019m prepared to be dragged over hot coals for this but I\u2019m actually voting YTA \u2026 but not for the reason OP is outlining. Rather, I think they\u2019re the asshole for even fostering in the first place before their own biological child has grown up and moved out. This is *so* going to create a complex for her \u201cnot being enough\u201d no matter how much time and energy her parents spend making sure she\u2019s not forgotten about or whatever.", "I don\u2019t think 13G\u2019s privilege requires that she sacrifices her own comfort for her foster siblings who only entered her life recently. Her agreeing for her parents to foster and invite strangers into their house is generous enough. She shouldn\u2019t have to give up more than she is willing just because she is more privileged.", "The 15 year old has been taken in by this family, they didn't have to do that. They aren't mistreating her at all either. She can live with sharing a bedroom. I'm almost 18 and I have to share a room with a younger sibling, and the age gap is almost twice what it is between these girls. It's annoying but I can still live with it. She isn't entitled to her own room.", "Nobody is saying we shouldn't be nice to 15 and 10. But just because their life is being uprooted by this, doesn't mean they should uproot 13's safe space by making her share so 15 can have her own room.\n\n15 and 10 can share. They're siblings. And OP fostering them is already trying to offer them a safe space within their means. Uprooting 13 would work against being that safe space they are offering. It would ruin the harmony in the home and make 13 resent everyone involved. Because now she's losing her safe space because someone else has it worse. \n\nJust because their life is worse doesn't mean her life has to be worse too. \n\nThey made an agreement before starting to foster. And for everyone involved, including the foster agency btw, it's important to honor that agreement. Again, everyone on the house has to be on board with fostering for it to work out.", "Then what is she saying then? (The person who I am replying to)", "When yelling into a void for their opinions maybe appreciate that they don\u2019t have the context or understanding of the foster care system as you do.    They probably don\u2019t know because most people don\u2019t deal with the foster care systems.", "As a former foster child who was in a sibling group, you absolutely need to not take on sibling groups if this is your attitude. You aren't the only foster family taking sibling groups, they deserve their own space at that age and if you can't provide that *you don't need or deserve to be taking sibling groups*. Good god, be a better person.", "You are freaking ridiculous. Having your own room is a privilege a lot of families who aren\u2019t dealing with a foster family can provide. Telling the OP she doesn\u2019t care or shouldn\u2019t foster is down right malicious. These children need a safe and loving home. OP is providing that. A teenager wanting their own room doesn\u2019t negate what OP is providing. Sit down with your nasty opinion.", "But foster parents can ask that question, can't they?", "Foster kids are told no all the goddamn time. If you can't provide what they need (their own rooms), then no. You don't have adequate space.", "\u201cYou should feel lucky you have this room, take what you can get\u201d is a garbage attitude to have for fostering.", "I\u2019m not arguing that it should. I'm saying that that will always be clear to her foster children is she takes in siblings who have to share a room. And for kids whose have *already been upended\u201d being made to feel like they should be lucky they even have a room at all feels shitty, even if that might be the reality. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t need to do anything different than she\u2019s doing now, I\u2019m just suggesting to her (and to some of the commenters here) and reflection on attitudes towards foster children. The reality of the situation can be \u201cyou need to take what you can get and be happy about it or risk being separated\u201d, but the trauma of that doesn\u2019t need to be put on the kids. So thinking about language and the importance of creating individual space for them even if it can\u2019t be their own rooms is important.", "Right. And it not being fair doesn\u2019t mean anything can and should change in this particular placement and room set up, it just means the 15 year old isn\u2019t an asshole for wanting her own room and being unhappy about it, as many people are implying, or that she should feel grateful. Her whole life has been turned upside down and she now has to live with strangers she doesn\u2019t know the motivations of. She\u2019s allowed to be pissed that she gets no privacy in this particular scenario.\n\nI see im getting downvoted, which is fine. I\u2019ve just worked with enough foster youth and adults transitioning from foster care to know that the \u201cyou should be lucky you\u2019re here\u201d stigma never goes away.", "You know what would solve this? Having them moved to a family with physical and mental space for them and the things they care about. Good lord.", "Bro just stop fostering. Why even doing this when you have a bio kid. Are you get a lot of money from them or something?", "\u2026if they don\u2019t know how the system works, they shouldn\u2019t try to advise OP on how they should navigate said system?", "Lmao and how many kids do you foster? You sound entitled as hell.", "Ok, so which sibling gets to stay. Oh and place the sibling that can\u2019t stay while you\u2019re at it.", "THIS!!!!! She is a TEENAGER.", "Shouldn't this be up to the social worker to determine? It's a super unfortunate situation, but I don't really think it's OP's fault....", "It\u2019s a better attitude than \u201csure, we\u2019ll break a promise to our daughter to make you happy.\u201d", "you should feel lucky you get a roof over your head, a sister who is alive, people who want you, food to eat, clean water to drink, some form of privacy, spaces to bathe, school to go to to get an education. these are things not everyone gets in life. i\u2019m saying she should be lucky that she has these privileges because she could be living on the streets, addicted to drugs, being a prostitute to provide for her sister, starving, being abused, all of these are very real situations foster kids experience. there is not space for her to get her own room and whatever way OP slits the room someone is unhappy, so why not keep it how it is?", "Do you not think that if social services *had* a family with 2 spare bedrooms, that they wouldn't have put them there?\n\nYou can't possibly be that clueless about how the foster system works and how utterly, miserably under-resourced it is? (in pretty much any country you choose to look at).\n\nKids get put where there is space. OP is doing an incredible thing by opening their home and providing space.\n\nCould be worse, they could be in an orphanage...", "I don\u2019t see why those are the only options. I\u2019m specifically referring to about this commenters attitude, not to what OPs options are. I don\u2019t think she should make her daughter share a room, I just also don\u2019t think \u201cbeing told no should be enough, you should be happy you\u2019re here\u201d isn\u2019t the attitude you should have when fostering from all of my experience working with foster youth and and adults transitioning from foster care who have been made to feel that way."]}
