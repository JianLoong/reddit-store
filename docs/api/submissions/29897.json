I had no problem with this because my house has a guest bed where she could stay in. \n\nThe next morning after her arrival I go downstairs to get breakfast and I\u2019m greeted with my mom, dad, and aunt standing there waiting for me. I say good morning to them and they don\u2019t say it back, just straight to business. They told me that my aunt doesn\u2019t have any form of transportation so she will be using my car until she finds a job and can get her own. They basically tell me I have no car for an unknown amount of time. I can\u2019t let this happen because of school, work, and friends but they tell me this is non-negotiable.\n\nI bite back by saying that they\u2019d have the rights to make their terms non-negotiable if they payed the gas and insurance for the car (which they don\u2019t, I do with money from my part time job) and that MY terms are non-negotiable. Such terms are no, she will not use my car as if it is her own and not mine. \n\nFor the record, I already knew she needed a car and was willing to let her use mine on occasion if she asked permission, but given the manner in which they presented this to me, now the only exception I\u2019ll make is if she needs a hospital. \n\nThey immediately blew up in my face about my comeback so I just tuned them out and focused on not spilling my Frosted Flakes but i managed to hear \u201cyou\u2019re a part of this family\u201d and \u201cwe make sacrifices for each other\u201d blah blah blah I just was not having any of it. \n\nI realized I wasn\u2019t gonna enjoy my breakfast in peace so I gave up and just left them with \u201cbehave like adults and maybe I will negotiate\u201d. \n\nMy parents were gonna follow me, but my aunt panics and starts screaming at them rather than me so their focus shifts to calming her down rather than stopping me.\n\nI go to my dad\u2019s office and grab the spare keys from his desk and then upstairs to my room for my main keys and wallet. I leave the house with them still arguing about about what they\u2019re gonna do. I was also smart enough to turn of my location services and leave the tile inside my car on the floor.\n\nI end up going to my girlfriends house to lie low for a bit. I explain the whole ordeal to her and she agrees entirely with me and that they\u2019re  wrong for trying to just take ownership of my car. Later, we meet up with friends and mess around for a bit, all while my phone is practically unusable because of the barrage of calls and texts. I explain my situation to them and they also agree with me.\n\nWe end planning to have a sleepover at my friends place because it\u2019s the weekend before Halloween, but also because I can\u2019t go home right now.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the story ends.

Aunt who dint plan well enough for her own life comes home and starts expecting to be treated like a princess and someone else has to pay the price for it. Worse still are the parents demanding thier kid give up something he needs and uses daily for her to be comfortable.", "NTA.\n\n>\u201cyou\u2019re a part of this family\u201d and \u201cwe make sacrifices for each other\u201d\n\nWhich sacrifices is she making for you? Don't your parents have a car that they can give to her?", "question, did you buy the car or your parents? if they bought its theirs. youre just renting it out too insurance and gas is nothing", "Did you buy the car or did your parents?", "The car is registered under my name. My dad paid for it at first but over the next year he took money out of my account and has since stopped so imagine I paid for it back in full. This all combined with insurance.", "Even if the parents paid for the car they can't just demand for him to give it up. He uses it daily. For school and to travel to work. Besides in that case he actually came up with the best solution.. she uses the car she pays for the insurance and stuff. Why would he pay? From what I understand OP has a part time job. It's wrong for anyone to expect him to give up his car and still pay for it. The aunt basically seems to want everything.. a house to stay in for free and a car she can use without paying for it.", "It's your car. They should have asked more nicely.", "NTA. They should have asked. I'd be very surprised if this didn't result in some reprisals though.", "NTA The car is in your name. You paid your dad back for it. You pay all costs associated with it. It could not be more your car.\n\nAs you said, if they had approached you differently you would have let her use it sometimes -- but your parents' hard-line stance necessitated a hard-line stance from you. They should in no way be validated in thinking that they have full control over your car and what you do with it, particularly when you have taken full financial responsibility for it.\n\nThis is a line that needed to be drawn. They need to realize that they have to respect that certain parts of your life, and possessions of yours, are no longer theirs to fully control as if you were just an extension of themselves like a finger on a hand.", "lmaoo its your dads car, plus you are staying at their house. its not fair but its also not your car", "NTA for your original post, but this? FFS make sure your account is unable to be accessed for any reason by anyone else!", "If the parents are paying for the car the kid isn\u2019t in a position to just say no. It requires compromise. If the kid paid for their own car plus they\u2019re paying for upkeep the parents don\u2019t really have a leg to stand on.", "I don\u2019t know why you getting downvotes. You make sense. NTA. The way the parents went about this was totally wrong and that aunt does sound a bit entitled it is sad about her situation but it\u2019s not OPs fault.", "OP replied to one of the earlier comments. He pays the insurance and gas. The father paid for the car which is in OPs name. Post that the father took money from him on a monthly basis or something like that. So he has paid the father back already.", "If it\u2019s paid off it\u2019s the kids and that should be the end of it.", "[deleted]", "I paid for my own car. My parents still tried to control when I was able to use it. People suck sometimes.", "Yeah they would. A lot of people believe that anyone younger than them should give things up for their elders. \n Believing that a kid\u2019s ( age is irrelevant to some parents, you are their kid, so you are always a child) needs cannot be as much of a priority as those of an older person. You\u2019ll not the parents don\u2019t seem to be volunteering use of their own cars, because in their minds they of course need their cars.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are abusing you. It sounds like they're using DARVO. DARVO stands for \"Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.\" The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim -- or the whistle blower -- into the bad one.\n\nLet's try to reframe this.\n\nSay you have a kid. You buy your kid a car and your kid pays you back. The kid has the car in their name and pays all bills and insurance. If your sisters car breaks, would you take your kids car without his permission to give to her?\n\nYou asking your parents not to take your car sounds like it has history to be more then that. It sounds like you asking them not to take your car is actually asking them to have enough respect for you as a human being not to take your car.  And their answer? NO!\n\nThey talk to you like you're a dog meant to be corrected and taught tricks.\n\nThis feels like the tip of an iceberg. Your parents don't have to be narcissists for you to read this, but I recommend rewarding r/raisedbynarcissists because the type of dynamic that could be going on is popular. The parents can prefer one person AKA your Aunt to the point that it's detrimental to everyone and they're choosing to ignore reality.\n\nYour parents are choosing to ignore that reality says you can give your Aunt the car without it harming you. By clearly communicating this, your parents are consciously choosing to be cruel to you.\n\nDon't. Give. Them. The. Car.\n\nNo is a complete sentence.", "Nta.  Change your bank accounts so your parents no longer have access and move out as soon as possible", "NTA\n\nIt's your car.  If your aunt was in an accident while driving, you could be held legally liable for any damages not covered by your insurance.  If your aunt or parents take the car, call the police and report it stolen.\n\nAlso, cut Dad's access to your bank account.  There have been posts on Reddit by people whose parents have emptied the poster's bank account to get control over the poster.", "Why does she need a car 24/7 if she doesn\u2019t have a job?", "NTA.  Your aunt and parents need to grow the duck up and realise they can not take other people\u2019s stuff just because they want to.", "NTA\n\nHow entitled of them all.\n\nSound like lying low and taking your keys is a good move.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are AHs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and \u201cwe make sacrifices for each other\u201d \" .. What a bullshit. If that were true, they would give her one of THEIR cars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho paid for the car, and in whose name is the deed?  But you are right: Tell them if she takes the car, you will cancel the insurance unless THEY pay for it.", "INF O: Who bought the car, and who is on the title? Insurance doesn't control the car, nor does gas. Ownership does.\n\nEdit: NTA. OP owns the car, and it was bought with his money.", "Question: who bought the car, and what names are on the title/registration? Is the car fully paid for, or is there a loan? If there is a loan, who makes the car payment?", "Who owns the car?  If you don't, paying the gas and insurance doesn't really entitle you to decide who uses it.  But I'm totally on your side.  IF they own the car, you may need to share it, but she should be paying you for it.", "Nta", "NTA, but lets get legal here. \n\nOk, so do your parents own the car?\n\nIf yes, then they can totally loan it to aunt.  Even if you used your money, buy the car, they own it, and *legally* (not morally) they can.  They will burn a bridge with you, and that may never recover, but they can.\n\nIf no, then they have nothing to stand on, and you can stop now.\n\nNext question, insurance.  You pay for it, great.\n\nSo they own the car, you pay insurance.  Now, if they burn that bridge and loan the car to her, cancel the insurance to save up for your own car.  \n\nThe question is how much of an AH you want to be about it.  You could just not tell them and \"surprise\" divorcing Aunt, gets pulled over or hit and has no insurance (this really would ruin them financially, as they can lose the house over a bad wreak), so I would put you in the AH camp.\n\nI would tell them but still cancel the insurance if they did take the car, though.", "NTA.   I'm confused though, is it your house or your parents?   That doesn't matter with the car though", "'You're all family and make sacrifices?' Then why isn't aunt staying with your parents and using their car?", "NTA. It's your car not theirs. If they take it then report it as stolen and press charges.", "Aunt who \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d?", "OP mentioned in a comment the title is in his name, and dad took money monthly from his account after buying the car - my guess is dad paid, then \u201creimbused\u201d himself.", "And call the police since the car is in his name and he paid the father back for it.

No reason to let your aunt have it. YOu would NEVER Get it back, because her situation will not improve.", "Then OP is NTA, thanks for responding.", "OP is solidly NTA", "In that case, his parents have no leg to stand on and can't do anything.\n\nI think that OP is handling it great.  \n\nIt would be nice if he just said he is safe and let the parents of his friends know why his parents might be calling them to find him, but that matters on how close to 18 he is.  \n\nHe might do so far as ro offer to move out (if a friend will help house him) so help ease the financial burden he is.\n\nThat should be started as, \"I have talking with some people and I really do want to help.  The solution I came up with is that I ease your financial burden by moving out. That way you can really help Aunt xxxx through this hard time without having me taking up money.\"", "Didn\u2019t.", "... because they are AHs."]}
