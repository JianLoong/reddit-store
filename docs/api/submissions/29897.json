We offered to let her live with us until she got back on her feet because she was unemployed. I had no problem with this because my house has a guest bed where she could stay in. \n\nThe next morning after her arrival I go downstairs to get breakfast and I\u2019m greeted with my mom, dad, and aunt standing there waiting for me. I say good morning to them and they don\u2019t say it back, just straight to business. They told me that my aunt doesn\u2019t have any form of transportation so she will be using my car until she finds a job and can get her own. They basically tell me I have no car for an unknown amount of time. I can\u2019t let this happen because of school, work, and friends but they tell me this is non-negotiable.\n\nI bite back by saying that they\u2019d have the rights to make their terms non-negotiable if they payed the gas and insurance for the car (which they don\u2019t, I do with money from my part time job) and that MY terms are non-negotiable. Such terms are no, she will not use my car as if it is her own and not mine. \n\nFor the record, I already knew she needed a car and was willing to let her use mine on occasion if she asked permission, but given the manner in which they presented this to me, now the only exception I\u2019ll make is if she needs a hospital. \n\nThey immediately blew up in my face about my comeback so I just tuned them out and focused on not spilling my Frosted Flakes but i managed to hear \u201cyou\u2019re a part of this family\u201d and \u201cwe make sacrifices for each other\u201d blah blah blah I just was not having any of it. \n\nI realized I wasn\u2019t gonna enjoy my breakfast in peace so I gave up and just left them with \u201cbehave like adults and maybe I will negotiate\u201d. \n\nMy parents were gonna follow me, but my aunt panics and starts screaming at them rather than me so their focus shifts to calming her down rather than stopping me.\n\nI go to my dad\u2019s office and grab the spare keys from his desk and then upstairs to my room for my main keys and wallet. I leave the house with them still arguing about about what they\u2019re gonna do. I was also smart enough to turn of my location services and leave the tile inside my car on the floor.\n\nI end up going to my girlfriends house to lie low for a bit. I explain the whole ordeal to her and she agrees entirely with me and that they\u2019re  wrong for trying to just take ownership of my car. Later, we meet up with friends and mess around for a bit, all while my phone is practically unusable because of the barrage of calls and texts. I explain my situation to them and they also agree with me.\n\nWe end planning to have a sleepover at my friends place because it\u2019s the weekend before Halloween, but also because I can\u2019t go home right now.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the story ends. I\u2019m sitting next to my girlfriend watching Breaking Bad with friends while writing this, and we\u2019re both having a laugh about all of it. I\u2019ll see if I can update later.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1698570318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17iyz6z/aita_for_not_letting_my_aunt_use_my_car/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know what kind of people your folks are, but around here, the next thing we expect to hear about is them reporting the car stolen.", "Info: whose name is on the title, and who paid for it?", "Who paid for the car?", "NTA tell her to learn the bus routes.", "NTA but a question,  how old are you?  From reading this, you may be a minor. Although it shouldn't make a difference,  if you are under 18 and in the US, it does. Under the age of majority, the parents have a great deal more latitude. Are you in college?  If so, who's paying for it?  Please understand that I agree that you're right, just giving you a few things to consider.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Aunt who dint plan well enough for her own life comes home and starts expecting to be treated like a princess and someone else has to pay the price for it. Worse still are the parents demanding thier kid give up something he needs and uses daily for her to be comfortable.", "NTA.\n\n>\u201cyou\u2019re a part of this family\u201d and \u201cwe make sacrifices for each other\u201d\n\nWhich sacrifices is she making for you? Don't your parents have a car that they can give to her?", "question, did you buy the car or your parents? if they bought its theirs. youre just renting it out too insurance and gas is nothing", "Did you buy the car or did your parents?", "The car is registered under my name. My dad paid for it at first but over the next year he took money out of my account and has since stopped so imagine I paid for it back in full. This all combined with insurance.", "Even if the parents paid for the car they can't just demand for him to give it up. He uses it daily. For school and to travel to work. Besides in that case he actually came up with the best solution.. she uses the car she pays for the insurance and stuff. Why would he pay? From what I understand OP has a part time job. It's wrong for anyone to expect him to give up his car and still pay for it. The aunt basically seems to want everything.. a house to stay in for free and a car she can use without paying for it.", "It's your car. They should have asked more nicely.", "NTA. They should have asked. I'd be very surprised if this didn't result in some reprisals though.", "NTA The car is in your name. You paid your dad back for it. You pay all costs associated with it. It could not be more your car.\n\nAs you said, if they had approached you differently you would have let her use it sometimes -- but your parents' hard-line stance necessitated a hard-line stance from you. They should in no way be validated in thinking that they have full control over your car and what you do with it, particularly when you have taken full financial responsibility for it.\n\nThis is a line that needed to be drawn. They need to realize that they have to respect that certain parts of your life, and possessions of yours, are no longer theirs to fully control as if you were just an extension of themselves like a finger on a hand.", "lmaoo its your dads car, plus you are staying at their house. its not fair but its also not your car", "NTA for your original post, but this? FFS make sure your account is unable to be accessed for any reason by anyone else!", "If the parents are paying for the car the kid isn\u2019t in a position to just say no. It requires compromise. If the kid paid for their own car plus they\u2019re paying for upkeep the parents don\u2019t really have a leg to stand on.", "I don\u2019t know why you getting downvotes. You make sense. NTA. The way the parents went about this was totally wrong and that aunt does sound a bit entitled it is sad about her situation but it\u2019s not OPs fault.", "OP replied to one of the earlier comments. He pays the insurance and gas. The father paid for the car which is in OPs name. Post that the father took money from him on a monthly basis or something like that. So he has paid the father back already.", "If it\u2019s paid off it\u2019s the kids and that should be the end of it.", "the parents wouldnt ask them to give up the car, i feel op is not telling the full story. why would their parents just do that if it\u2019s supposedly op\u2019s car? some parents are weird and use buying things for you as a way to control you. just save up and buy your own car so they can not ever use it.", "I paid for my own car. My parents still tried to control when I was able to use it. People suck sometimes.", "Yeah they would. A lot of people believe that anyone younger than them should give things up for their elders. \n Believing that a kid\u2019s ( age is irrelevant to some parents, you are their kid, so you are always a child) needs cannot be as much of a priority as those of an older person. You\u2019ll not the parents don\u2019t seem to be volunteering use of their own cars, because in their minds they of course need their cars."]}
