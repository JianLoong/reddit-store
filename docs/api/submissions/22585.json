He couldn't remember the name of it, so he googled her, but nothing came up. Now, my stepdad is a genius at finding people, like the guy from Baptiste, so when he couldn't find her name anywhere associated with the college, he fell down a rabbit hole, and long story short he found out that pretty much none of what Emma told us about herself was true. She doesn't teach college art, she's an art teacher at a secondary school. Her family is from an entirely different part of England than she said, and she didn't go to the school she said did, nor the university. The parents said not to mention it for the time being, as they weren't sure if it was worth mentioning to Alex and meddling in the relationship, as he can be super defensive.\n\nThe things is, it is becoming increasingly awkward to be around Emma. Whenever she mentions anything about her past or her life, the three of us are sitting there either knowing or wondering if she is lying. The resentment towards her is obviously starting to build from the parents because she is continuing to lie to their faces, and I find myself not wanting to really spend time with her because I feel like I'm talking to a paper person. The atmosphere is becoming weird.\n\nAlex doesn't like his dad meddling in his life so I can see why my stepdad doesn't want to say anything, plus there's a chance Alex already knows about Emma's lies. That's why I'm thinking of pulling Emma aside and telling her we know she's lying. It would give her a chance to come clean with Alex if she hasn't, or at least to stop digging herself in deeper by continuing the charade. Then again, it could pull the pin out of the grenade on this whole issue.

If she's lying about this, who's to say she won't lie about other stuff? Are you gonna have to fact check everything she says for the rest of your life?", "YWBTA if you talked to Emma about this, you need to talk to your stepbrother. If you have a good relationship with your step brother, pull him to the side and just tell the truth of what your family found.  Let him know they weren't snooping to be malicious, it was a search with good intentions and that is how they found the additional information.\n\nSide note, not sure what the uproar is about, really.  It's not like she is secretly a stripper, she is still a teacher.  She isn't lying about graduating from college.  She is embellishing a few things, not sure why, maybe she feels that your family is a bit judgmental?", "Is it possible at all she just got the job? Sure would be interesting if you ask to meet her for lunch\u2026on campus.", "NAH. I'd tread carefully here; it may be as simple as she's lying because she's insecure or a shitty person, or she could be lying because she has to for some reason (fake identify, who knows). There is also the (albeit small) possibility that your stepdad has this all wrong. I think you should talk to her, but don't open with 'we all know you're lying'. Just say you looked her up and what you found contradicted what she'd told you.", "NTA. You don't want a potential pathological liar in the house with you and confronting her would provide her the chance to come clean and make things right. \n\nYou should be non-abrasive when talking to her though. There could be reasons why she's lying. She could be trying to keep her past hidden from an abusive family member/ex. And depending on the lies she could just be telling things to make her seem better in her bfs and your family's lies. Letting her know that you accept her for how she is (minus the lies) would help assuage the fears.\n\nBut no, having someone regularly in your life that is a known liar makes you doubt everything that they will do. It will only get worse until it's resolved. And since it seems like everyone in your family knows about it, someone will say something to her and make everything blow up. You should talk to just her, be kind and understanding, but be firm.", "NTA\n\nIt feels awful when somebody lies in your face.\n\nYou should address the issue and give her the chance to explain.\n\nOtherwise you will explode one day.", "She sounds like the kind of person who lies about insignificant things because she lies about everything. Nobody cares whether you teach art at grade school or college, so why lie about it?\n\nI'd talk to you stepbrother, but not her. If you confront her, she'll lie again and make you look bad. Then you'll fact check that lie and get lied to again. Hopefully he'll dump lady George santos before he gets in too deep\n\nEdit: also, NTA, and update us if she is George Santos in a wig.", "NTA. If she's about something so small that doesn't even provide any benefit to her, she'll definitely lie about things that do.", "Everyone exaggerates. But Emma is flat out lying. \n\nNTA. Engage her in conversation. Ask probing questions. Give her the opportunity to come clean without accusing her. Frankly, give her the rope to hang herself without being accusatory and continue the online search. Your bro isn\u2019t likely to react well if she\u2019s ganged up on, so give him the information quietly. \n\nAnd *please* update when Emma is eventually questioned and what happens.", "YWBTA. You guys need to find something better to do than stalk this poor girl. Find something useful to do with your lives and mind your own business. Internet search results about people are very incomplete and often not accurate. If you google me the first hits still still me at a job I left in 2014. Leave this poor couple alone.", "NTA.This is coming from my perspective. There has been times friends or family knew something about me but no  one would approach me. It wasn\u2019t so much they knew something about me but they were talking behind my back. \n\nTell your bro. Also what another poster said something to the effect of her feeling she had to lie for fear of being judged by your family? Maybe see if there is something behind that.", "NTA, but I wouldn't confront her either. If possible, try talking to your stepbrother about it, but not in a HA! GUESS WHAT WE FOUND! way", "YTA. Nosy fucks.", "YTA....you and your parents. Y'all have way to much time on your hands.", "YTA - who knows she may feel inadequate and lies to make up for those perceived deficiencies.\n\nUnless these lies result in some grave trust/financial issues, don't think it is worth it.", "ESH. Emma is exaggerating or lying, or maybe she is just pathologically private. Your stepfather and family do extensive background searches on dating partners, friends, etc.\n\nWhat makes you think Alex doesn't know? Since you say he is super defensive it is probably due to major boundary stomping like this. Maybe your nosy asses are being set up by the two of them. That would be funny.\n\nEither way it is probably best you take your parent's advise and stay quiet.", "NTA, I worked with a pathological liar. It sounds like she lied about her while existence.
