No reason to assume BF is flaunting his underwear but there is a good reason to assume OP is starting at Bfs ass.", "What\u2019s \u201csagging\u201d?", ">Nta who wants to see anybody else\u2019s underwear? It\u2019s not a problem he\u2019s wearing it, the problem is he\u2019s showing it.\n\nThis was very clearly an Op problem. We want people to let women be. We cannot now be hypocrites. \n\nIf it bothers you, look elsewhere", "I\u2019m wearing a tshirt and I raise my arms above my head, my t shirt rides above my belt line and you catch a glance at the waist band of my boxer shorts. That\u2019s not me showing my underwear, it\u2019s a normal consequence of being a man in a tshirt that\u2019s an appropriate length. Zero reason to think underwear is hanging out but a good question to ask is why is OP starting at sisters BFs ass.", "Unlike the thong that was being worn", "Besides, doesn\u2019t he know that it\u2019s *illegal*, and his girlfriend\u2019s sibling is the undies police, and expecting them to turn a blind eye puts them in a really bad position? So inconsiderate.", "Op seems to be more into thong ass", "Not that I've seen. Most people generally just don't care about it one way or the other.", "Listen if my thong or any of my friends thongs are even peeking out everyone I know is gunna do the pull aside and speak up. \n\nI am guessing she mentions this because she wasn\u2019t sure if it was maybe intentional or since it was a guy she wasn\u2019t sure how to approach it and was \u201cconfused\u201d possibly on what the appropriate action is. I\u2019d probs be uncomfortable too if someone\u2019s showing a whale tale while talking to my nana about Medicare options. \n\nI do agree her wording is extremely odd and I think it does come off as her passing some judgement. I took the AITA question to be if she did the right thing by pulling aside the sister which I think is, and she wanders into AH territory with her judgments and opinions on his \u201csexual freedom\u201d and pushing that since *she* is uncomfortable, then it must be fixed.", "Except she discussed it with the /wrong/ person. If OP was trying to be nice by being like \\*whispers to the person\\* Your underwear is showing. Then I could see that being 100% okay, I'd want someone to tell me the same.\n\nBut OP brought it to the sister instead, making it a \"control your boyfriend's wardrobe/behavior\" issue and not an issue of concern that boyfriend might be embarrassed and doesn't realize his undies are out.", "YTA For me, it was the comment about it making her uncomfortable. Why? Because it was a thong? Does she have a sliding scale of \u201cunprofessional\u201d underwear? Would she have said anything if it were boxers?\n\nIf she\u2019d said something to her sister (or him) because it was the equivalent of \u201chey, you have spinach in your teeth,\u201d I\u2019d be on her side. But taking about how he\u2019s sexually free is also super weird. She was turned on and made it everyone else\u2019s problem.", "That makes sense. I still think that makes it an ESH situation. I think it\u2019s weird that the sister and her bf were both cool with him flashing a thong in front of family like that. No judgment on private decisions, I just think it\u2019s about presenting yourself respectfully in front of your significant other\u2019s family.", "Usually a male perpetrator, when walking their waistline \u201csags\u201d below their butt cheeks and you can see some nice buns, not very classy and the perp is usually stereotyped as a \u201cthug\u201d (whether true or not) by people who do not sag (most people).", "I would be equally as bothered by a woman having her thong on display especially at a family gathering. It\u2019s so inappropriate. I wouldn\u2019t want my mom to have to look at my husband\u2019a boxers either.", "I mean there are definitely some who would perv on a woman showing her thong and I can\u2019t speak for everyone but I don\u2019t want to see anyone\u2019s underwear family or not \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "LOL", "Well if she thinks she is the panties police she is \"gonna miss the panty raid\"", "They are after that brown eye.", "Thank uu finally someone with a brain\u2026 When did people stop having shame???", "Do we know OP is a women, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a man, that I actually thought OP was a man and perhaps was uncomfortable with his sexuality and that\u2019s why he was staring at his sisters boyfriends ass and the upset about it? I could be completely wrong, hence check on OPs gender.", "If I was at a family event, I would rather my husband come and tell me my underwear were showing instead of my brother in law.", "I saw that more as approaching the person she knows better in the couple. And it would be a bit weird to approach your sisters boyfriend and say 'your underwear is on display. Is that intentional or haven't you noticed yet?'", "Ah thank you, learned a new expression today!", "If I had coins I\u2019d give you an award so hard for the reference", "Like, really. Everyone seems to only focus on the word 'unprofessional' which yes is ridiculous in this context. But I personally don't want to see anyone underpants.", "Click your profile top right, click coins, claim free award. Can do it 1 time a week I think.", "UGH GOD I AWARDED THE WRONG COMMENT but thank you for the instruction \ud83e\udd74"]}
