Though in my experience in high school, the guys wore actual underwear underneath a colorful shorts or boxers, then had their pants low. Did I like it, not particularly. It could be pretty gross. Other times I appreciated when they would wear a more fun/artsy statement piece, as they provided more coverage and looked more artsy. But that was a different case where they were all painted with a racist brush calling them all thugs when they were just trying to imitate their favorite artists, for better or for worse since some imitation can be bad. And many were considerate enough to have actual underwear on underneath their statement piece and they would pull their pants up for family, and teachers.\n\nGenerally speaking, people really shouldn\u2019t be forced to look at others underwear in a family gathering, work setting, or any public setting. It\u2019s unsanitary and impolite. Get a belt and longer shirts. I can understand being around immediate family, like you just got out of the shower,  you\u2019re getting ready for bed, maybe sitting down to watch a show, no big. I still personally think you could throw on shorts, short shorts, or lounge pants for that added layer, but that\u2019s just me. Family shouldn\u2019t sexualize you, nor should you sexualize your family members. Also you\u2019re not in public or anywhere it would be considered impolite to be in your underwear/have it showing. BUT this was this guy\u2019s girlfriends family, at someone else\u2019s house, come on man. \n\nThe y t a\u2019s here are wild. We live in a society people! It\u2019s seems too many terminally online people act like they care about the community, when all they really care about is themselves and \u2018my desires supersede all else.\u2019 There\u2019s self-care, respecting yourself, and being yourself, and then there\u2019s caring about others, respecting others, and behaving like a human being who\u2019s capable of choosing their battles, when to compromise, when to hold firm, and when to move on from something. All of these can exist at the same time.\n\nEdited to copy and paste from another comment of mine.", "NTA", "I'm gonna say NTA but I think you did it for the wrong reasons.

So thank you for that. \n\nBut also you\u2019re 100% correct. Honestly at this point I think a good amount of people would have the only thought when spotting the thong of \u2018oh, underwear.\u2019 And then avert their gaze. It\u2019s just not that serious.", "again, what part of \"peaking out the back of his pants\" sounds like he was purposely getting his rocks off? would you say the same if it was the waistband of his boxers? no because you're correlating a man wearing a thong with kink.", "Because it probably is?\nI\u2019m as gay and swish as they come and I\u2019ve never known any guy to wear a thong for \u201ccomfort\u201d. \n\nMen wearing women\u2019s underwear however is a very common fetish practice. In the context of the information provided it\u2019s not hard to reach a conclusion.", "This comparison made me laugh unreasonably hard", "as someone who's very active in the queer and kink communities I wouldn't assume. especially because I know of men and amab people (even straight or bisexual men) who wear \"women's underwear\" (btw they make thongs for men) just because they're more comfortable in them. not just physical comfort but it makes them feel confident or whatever non kink related reason people wear cute underwear. I just think it's harsh to jump to the conclusion that the boyfriend is actively violating others consent.", "Agree to disagree. This seems pretty clear cut to me, and having a g string riding up your ass is far removed from my idea of comfort, but so be it."]}
