Have you ever heard of disinfectant? It\u2019s not only pee you have to worry about, what about planters warts, foot fungus?  Just clean your shower and bathroom and stop being disrespectful to your father and his guest. You live under his roof.

But having a conniption over someone peeing in the shower is just silly. \n\nRegardless of what some responders have said, peeing in the shower is very common, both men & women do it, it goes down the drain along with the soap and shampoo suds, and is no more unsanitary than scrubbing off a lot of sweat, or dirt or anything else you may need to shower off.\n\nYTA.", "It smelled strongly of pee in the toilet and that made you think he peed in the shower? lol\n\nPeeing in the shower doesn't leave a smell of pee.

The only time there's a smell is if he doesn't flush the toilet. \n\nEveryone has their thing I guess.", "Mark peed in the shower and didn't run the water to flush it down the drain.

Maybe some people pee in THEIR shower. It is not OK to do it in someone else's. As OP's father, he should have supported them.\n\nAlthough blowing up in front of everyone else went too far. I would have asked him to scrub the shower clean and NOT do it again.\n\nI would still sat NTA because who wants to enter their shower smelling the pungent smell of asparagus pee?

And in this situation i would too.", "I think OP is using 'toilet' to refer to both the fixture and the room. It smelled like piss in the bathroom. \n\nIf somebody pees while having a shower and the soapy water washes it down, I don't think that's such a big deal.  I wonder if OP means the guy urinated into the shower stall as if it was a pee trough, while not showering. That would be disgusting.", "> Everyone pees in the shower\n\n*Everyone*? No, they don\u2019t.", "Did the medical journal say anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?", "...So there was no actual evidence of said alleged pee. Did Mark admit it? Because I legitimately doubt that if he peed \\*while the shower was running\\* that it would be smellable.\n\nWhy did you go into the shower immediately after he took one? Did you *suspect* he had peed? Give me all the details here OP, too many gaps\n\nEdit: Also if he peed in the toilet couldn't that have also made the bathroom smell of pee? If there was no *visual evidence* of said alleged pee then he washed it away. Wouldn't a toilet's water dilution act similarly? *How are we so sure he peed in the shower specifically?*", "I bet someone people here will tell you it is a very good way to clean your feet.", "Is your drain broken?\n\nSorry, I don't see an issue with this, peeing in showers.\n\nEveryone in this thread is a stuck up crybaby.", "Well nobody could stand in it though, that's the thing.\n\nIt's a problem that OP could smell it though.", "I didn't suspect. I just wanted a shower. And he must have done it at the end of the shower or something, because I could smell it. Also he admitted to it later.", "The ammonia in urine can act as a natural astringent and help exfoliate skin /s", "pee doesnt just flush away it'll stick in the drain, more or less if you dont hit the damn drain. You need to rinse away the pee just like a toilet...", "OKAY HE ADMITTED TO IT!\n\nI mean, if his pee smelled so strongly that you could smell it even after the shower ended & any actual pee was gone, i am pretty sure the pee smell would be just as bad if he used the toilet. I'm not saying the shower is the ideal place, but this is normal for a lot of people (peeing in the shower). And he didn't leave any residue or pee stains.\n\nIn this case, sorry, OP: yeah, i think YTA. this is not an abnormal thing for many people. he didn't leave a mess. i actually am worried about that dude's health though if his pee smells that strong such that it lingers after peeing \\*in a shower\\* and \\*washing it all away\\*... like actually is he okay?\n\nalso YTA because you fully yelled and kicked the dude out over it. Super embarrassing for him. You couldn't have taken him aside, said it bothered you and asked him not to do it again?", "I never kicked him out. And we had just had asparagus in dinner, which (for most people I know at least) can give you very pungent urine.", "Peeing in the shower causes athlete's foot, and it's just disgusting. Sorry but you are actually ta here for condoning it in the first place.", "Oh you said he wasn't welcome in your home LOL so I assumed that meant you kicked him out. Sorry man I still think YTA here -- you overreacted and you're allowed to have boundaries and rules for your own home, but you have to communicate those first or approach him nicely about it later. Yelling is generally not usually a good way to first approach discussing a problem with someone", "Hahaha, that's hilarious. Peeing in the shower is good for the environment (saves you a flush), efficient and definitely doesn't cause athletes foot. I'm a woman and I always pee in the shower. BUT if your shower smells afterwards you are doing it wrong. Just pee over the drain in the beginning of your shower, before you wash yourself with soap.", "&#x200B;\n\nI think it's just human nature. I was really mad.", "Why are you posting in AITA if you absolutely don't think you were TA? \n\nBeing mad and angry is an emotion that you can't control\n\nHow you behave/respond/react to it is in your control -- we aren't usually assholes because we have human emotions; we are assholes when our behavior is rude, hostile, aggressive,  inconsiderate, etc.", "I don't think I'm completely nta"]}
