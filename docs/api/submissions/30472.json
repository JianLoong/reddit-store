My parents took over Thanksgiving for our \"branch\" of the family and it has been this way for like 20 years or so.  Recently my parents said they are getting too old to keep prepping huge dinners and they don't want to do it anymore.  They both flat out said they'd like me to take it over soon or for me and my brother's family to take turns hosting.  FYI my parents do cook 90% of everything but each family also brings a side or dessert as per the hosts' request.\n\nNow 2 things about me, my house is small and I don't have much room to host what could potentially be 15 people but I also loathe cooking, especially very large meals.  I don't even like to cook for my family of 4 but I do it because that's what you do or my partner will, but a lot of the time we get takeaway or go to a restaurant.  My brother's house is larger and while they also don't like to cook or prep meals they would absolutely suffer through making food for Thanksgiving by hand out of some weird sense of duty.\n\nI said I didn't mind taking over the holiday but I'd be getting the event catered.  My parents got upset at this and said I should be cooking the meal myself, and they would of course bring a side or dessert.  They even went so far as to say that if I had Thanksgiving catered, they wouldn't want to come.  It's not like we'd cheap out; my partner and I have 0 issues spending $$$ on restaurants/catered food especially if it's GOOD food.  My partner said I should just get the catered Thanksgiving food and pretend I cooked it all myself.  How would my family even know?\n\nWIBTA for lying and saying I cooked the food?  Should I do a \"big reveal\" after they've all eaten the food?  Or should I just suck it up and cook everything over a couple of days?", "created_utc": 1699295767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p9kvx/wibta_for_having_thanksgiving_catered/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't cause further problems by not being honest about it or doing a reveal. \n\nYour parents are forcing you to cling to a tradition that doesn't suit you, and it sounds like your siblings would be better suited to cook, host, and uphold the tradition.

NTA. 2) WYBTA if you lied about the catering? YTA\n\nYou would be the host so your parents no longer have a say in how the event is run. If they are going to be that upset about the meal being catered that they would refuse to come, that's their right but, honestly, it would be an AH move. However, lying is very rarely the right way to go. They might forgive you for adjusting the family tradition by having the food catered but it's going to be much harder for them to forgive you for doing that AND lying about it. The truth almost always comes out, especially when there's potentially dozens of people involved in the situation. All it would take is one take out tray to be spotted or one young kid saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.", "I have no real opinion about getting catered food and \u201cstretching the truth\u201d about it being homemade so to speak but this\n\n*Should I do a \"big reveal\" after they've all eaten the food*\n\nis a bad idea unless you love a good holiday brawl", "NTA...If they want you to do it, they have to accept that you're going to do it YOUR way.

Lol", "NTA to cater, but don't do the \"big reveal\" BS.  It just causes drama.  People can either accept that you refuse to cook, or they can take a long walk off a short pier.", "So they made you the host of a big family tradition and are now trying to force you to do it exactly how they want? Go with the catering and then dare them to stay home over it. You provided the meal, but they can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NAH\n\nYou get why this is a big deal to them right?

Our solution (which took a couple years to get the best) was we catered the majority of the food and each family brought a side/dessert/appetizer of one of our family favorites or maybe a new dish they wanted to try.  For example, when some people were eating less carbs, a SIL brought a loaded cauliflower casserole.  I arranged for the catering from a local restaurant and my brother would pick it up.  The restaurant prepared turkey, mashed potatoes, dressing, gravy.  You could get more sides from them too but we found these were the things we didn\u2019t want to prepare ourselves & the catered versions were delicious.", "NTA for saying you won't do all the cooking and that you want to get it catered.

Are you going to take the precooked turkey and put it in the oven and pull it out every so often to baste it with juice you added separately?

I also do not cook, but can make a mean cheese plate and don't mind bringing over several many bottles of wine to share, which is why I only get asked to bring appetizers and drinks to the holidays.  Also why I married someone who cooks.\n\nAnyway.  Don't lie about it, but do put your catered food in nice serving dishes.

Your parents presumably already know that you do not like to cook.  You should never have told them you would have the meal catered.

Should I do a \"big reveal\" after they've all eaten the food? Or should I just suck it up and cook everything over a couple of days?\n\nNAH but if you do tell them or let them think it was home made, don't do a 'reveal' it will upset them. If you feel you must cater and hide it: then either tell them it's catered, or never tell them. Change the subject. (I think it's preferable to just tell them the truth.)\n\nI agree with the other person who said that they (your parents) hate to see the tradition end.\n\nIt might already be emotional for them to not do it any more, even if they say it's too much for them; doesn't mean they like seeing the end of it, in some ways. It means 'the end of an era' when they or their siblings took turns.\n\nBut just maybe tell them (for their sakes) it means a lot to you too and all but you have a tiny kitchen and this year, will need 'some help' getting the meal out. Tell them there will be plenty of homemade touches too (maybe non food traditions or decor you can think of, just to show them you put your own stamp on it), and to give you a chance. Maybe they will soften a bit.\n\nThey might be imagining big impersonal tubs of food instead of a lovely meal simply cooked by someone else. Maybe they need time to get used to it. They might be kind of mourning the old days, so it's already something to get used to.\n\nNAH. YWNBTA\n\n\\> Should I do a \"big reveal\"\n\nNo. Don't shock them; if you tell them one thing, stick to it. (But why lie to them at all.)", "WIBTA if you did this without telling and they would know if you known for not cooking and suddenly you prepare and professional meal appears they are going to know. The fact you even thought about doing a big reveal makes me wonder how much you actually care about your family.", "NTA for wanting to cater. YTA if you lie about making the food. \nSomeone in the thread made the point that your parentals/family probably see it as the end of a tradition, so you could probably put a spin on it with catering in most of the food but make a couple of the favorite dishes/desserts/easy recipes to satiate them. There are plenty of no bake/one pan/boards (charcuterie etc.) you can easily throw together if they really want to something homemade, plus you can always ask them to \u201chelp\u201d put it together to make it more traditional.", "NTA to want to cater it. However, it's quite easy to just cook the turkey and have the balance pre ordered from a caterer and slid into baking dishes to warm before they arrive. They wouldn't even question it , especially when they see the baking dishes and the turkey coming out of the oven. I have done this, and no one ever knew. Do not buy any food from the grocery, as they will recognize it when they bite into it. If anyone asks for a recipe, say no problem, you will email it to them. The problem with Thanksgiving meals now is that it's not the 1950s and women don't have the time to cook for 3 days leading up to the event.", "NAH\n\nTraditions are traditions. I think your parents want the \"home cooked\" tradition to continue, as it's important to them. They may feel the \"home made\" is about love.\n\nI get that.\n\nHowever, you should be honest about your feelings, and ask this question... if there is one special home made dish you treasure, I would \"love\" to make that.\n\nBe honest, it's coming from love I'm sure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
