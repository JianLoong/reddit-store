Since 2 of my friends are bringing their partners along with them, I\u2019ve asked my boyfriend (19M) if he wanted to come under the condition that he earned the money himself to cover his expenses, including plane tickets and accommodations, which had come around to be around CAD$5,000.\n\nI made this request months ago because I knew he was going to ask his parents for the money to cover the expenses, which they had always given him (like when his brother asked for $3k for a gaming setup and when he asked for $2k so he could have a tv in his room). His family isn't super wealthy, but they are well-to-do. and his mom has tried to ask him to try and get a part-time job during school breaks to which he has always said he'll try but ended up never getting one. I grew up in a household where we often had to get by and thus, has worked/been working multiple part-time jobs since I was 16 and have been trying to urge him to get a job with his mother. \n\nA couple of days ago, he told me he wants to go on the trip with me which shocked me as I questioned how he was going to raise $5000 since we still have classes and semester break doesn't start till late Feb and he told me he asked his parents and they agreed to help pay for his expenses.\n\nI told him no I would not be allowing him to go on the trip with me and refused to share our itinerary document with him since I made it clear I didn't want his parents to pay for his expenses and established that he would have to earn his keep. But he told me that this was something I should have zero say over since I was never in charge of how his parents' money. We had a fight over this and he called me a controlling manipulative freak before ranting to my friends' partners who are going on this trip with us (we're all part of the same friend group)\n\nThey all agreed I was a little out of line and should have no say over how he raised the funds needed. I don't want to rant to my other friends about this since I don't want them to think badly of me or my boyfriend but it really made me confused as I have no clue if I'm the one at fault here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671452336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpq2sj/aita_for_not_allowing_my_boyfriend_to_come_with/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is really odd behaviour and you clearly have no business being in a relationship if this is how you treat people.", "YTA because you say you made the request \"months ago because I knew he was going to ask his parents\" and then denied him going on the trip because he asked his parents.", "You clearly don\u2019t respect him, so why are you with him?\n\nYTA.", "YTA, why does it matter how he pays for his expenses? What if he won some money in in the lottery, would that be ok or would that not be allowed either because he did not work for it? You seem super weirdly controlling for no discernable reason.", "ESH.\n\nYour boyfriend has obvious entitlement issues.\n\nYou're the AH because you're leveraging a vacation to make a point and police your boyfriend's behavior.  If his lack of a job bothers you, break up: but don't be in a relationship and then humiliate and exclude somebody into becoming the person you actually want to date.", "YTA. I think it's unreasonable to expect a 19 year old to have $5000. I think many 19 year olds would need to ask parents for help with this trip. I'm not saying no 19 year old has it. But working and paying for school?! Maybe it's just me but I no one I knew at 19 could pay for this alone. Whether they had scholarships, help from parents, or no support at all.", "YTA - you are behaving like his mother not his girlfriend. Be happy for him, that he has parents that can afford to spoil him. You seem jealous of this. Do you like your boyfriend or do you want to educate him?\n\nI feel for you because of the way you grew up. It was similar for me. But comparing and especially jealousy only makes you bitter.\n\nSorry english is not my First Language.", "It's not up to you to \"discipline\" or change what you really don't like in your boyfriend.  And I get that you really don't like his entitled attitude towards money or seem to have any work ethic.

If his self sufficiency isn't enough to go on the trip, is not enough to be a boyfriend.\n\nIt sounds like you are trying to fix him. Stop that and move on to other guys who aren't broken.", "YTA. Why do you care how he pays for the trip, as long as he\u2019s covering his own costs?\n\nYour boyfriend is clearly entitled, and that\u2019s his and his parent\u2019s problem, not yours\u2026nor is it your business.", "YTA. It really is none if your business how he gets the money to fund the trip. You're not engaged or married; his money is his business.

That's why I say ESH.", "YTA - he and his parents' finances are not your concern. It seems like the bigger issue is that you don't respect his work ethic, which may be a matter of incompatibility. Either accept him as is or move on.", "YTA. his financial affairs are none of your business. if i were him i would dump you over this.", "YTA for even dating this dude when this is clearly a point of incompatibility for you both, you don\u2019t respect him and respecting your partner is very important in a relationship. If him not working bothers you to this extent, then you should not be with him as it is clear he is not putting enough effort into working to meet your standards. Wherever he gets the money from for the trip is not your business.", "YTA and I dont get all the ESH saying BF is entitled? If any if you could afford to treat your children like that you would. Especially when studying!!! OP you're a control freak seriously. Probably jealous too.", "YTA", "Idk why you know so much about his parents finances or why you turned around and told the internet about them, but you need to dislodge your nose from their business, first thing. \n\nYour bf does not sound like a prize, while you sound like you at least have an admirable work ethic. Withholding itinerary details to a vacation you invited him on because you demanded he comply with your funding requirements is controlling, anal-retentive behavior, and even your friends think it\u2019s weird. You might have a great future in asset management compliance, however, that skill set is beautifully on display here.", "ESH\n\nyour BF is never going to understand the value of money. Yet you have no right to tell him not to accept financial help from his parents.", "YTA, you don't get to dictate how he raises the money and this is nothing new, he depends on his parents to cave. Either accept that and stay with him or leave him to find someone who can deal with him.", "YTA I think it's less to do with teaching him a lesson and more like being jealous of fact you know his family would pay for him and like you said you had to work for anything you needed. Bit harsh with him just break up with him if you don't like him", "ESH\n\nIt really isn't up to you where he gets the money or what his parents spend their money on.\n\nThat said, if he's refusing to get a job and is just assuming his parents will pay for anything he wants, that's kind of gross behaviour.", "ETA\n\nHim for not taking responsibility for his own life. You for belittling him by treating him like your child.", "It is not your responsibility to teach your bf financial independence. It\u2019s his parents\u2019 job. They seem to be fine supporting him whenever it needed. You, on the other hand, seem like someone who is placing a huge importance on financial independence\u2026 Unfortunately people don\u2019t change miraculously because their SO want them to. You will need to learn to either accept people who they are, or move on without them in your life. Your approach to finances is entirely different, and should you keeping moving forward with this relationship it bound to create problems. I\u2019m not saying people don\u2019t change, but both of you are still young (he\u2019s 19, barely an adult) and I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath waiting till he grows up\u2026\n\nA very soft YTA, as I get where you coming from, still you overstepped to parent territory\u2026", "Nta. You two dont mesh well and are two different wave lengths. This WILL never change. Trust ne ive been there.

It seems like you\u2019re struggling with respecting him.  Share that with him explicitly. My guess is that it is insurmountable for you.   \n \nHe sucks less because I\u2019m inferring that he accepted the condition. He should not have.", "esh....you need to think about your future with him if u want to end up supporting him becuase his lack of responsibility and relying on his parents for money and no sense of responsibility ultimately he probably wont change.   think about how u want your future to look like with him and then look at him closely.  those red flags arent going away", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
