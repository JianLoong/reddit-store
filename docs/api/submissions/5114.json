Since 2 of my friends are bringing their partners along with them, I\u2019ve asked my boyfriend (19M) if he wanted to come under the condition that he earned the money himself to cover his expenses, including plane tickets and accommodations, which had come around to be around CAD$5,000.\n\nI made this request months ago because I knew he was going to ask his parents for the money to cover the expenses, which they had always given him (like when his brother asked for $3k for a gaming setup and when he asked for $2k so he could have a tv in his room). His family isn't super wealthy, but they are well-to-do. and his mom has tried to ask him to try and get a part-time job during school breaks to which he has always said he'll try but ended up never getting one. I grew up in a household where we often had to get by and thus, has worked/been working multiple part-time jobs since I was 16 and have been trying to urge him to get a job with his mother. \n\nA couple of days ago, he told me he wants to go on the trip with me which shocked me as I questioned how he was going to raise $5000 since we still have classes and semester break doesn't start till late Feb and he told me he asked his parents and they agreed to help pay for his expenses.\n\nI told him no I would not be allowing him to go on the trip with me and refused to share our itinerary document with him since I made it clear I didn't want his parents to pay for his expenses and established that he would have to earn his keep. But he told me that this was something I should have zero say over since I was never in charge of how his parents' money. We had a fight over this and he called me a controlling manipulative freak before ranting to my friends' partners who are going on this trip with us (we're all part of the same friend group)\n\nThey all agreed I was a little out of line and should have no say over how he raised the funds needed. I don't want to rant to my other friends about this since I don't want them to think badly of me or my boyfriend but it really made me confused as I have no clue if I'm the one at fault here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671452336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpq2sj/aita_for_not_allowing_my_boyfriend_to_come_with/", "score": 1895, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What if he won some money in in the lottery, would that be ok or would that not be allowed either because he did not work for it? You seem super weirdly controlling for no discernable reason.", "ESH.\n\nYour boyfriend has obvious entitlement issues.\n\nYou're the AH because you're leveraging a vacation to make a point and police your boyfriend's behavior.

If him not working bothers you to this extent, then you should not be with him as it is clear he is not putting enough effort into working to meet your standards. Wherever he gets the money from for the trip is not your business.", "YTA and I dont get all the ESH saying BF is entitled? If any if you could afford to treat your children like that you would. Especially when studying!!! OP you're a control freak seriously. Probably jealous too.", "YTA", "Idk why you know so much about his parents finances or why you turned around and told the internet about them, but you need to dislodge your nose from their business, first thing. \n\nYour bf does not sound like a prize, while you sound like you at least have an admirable work ethic. Withholding itinerary details to a vacation you invited him on because you demanded he comply with your funding requirements is controlling, anal-retentive behavior, and even your friends think it\u2019s weird. You might have a great future in asset management compliance, however, that skill set is beautifully on display here.", "[deleted]", "YTA, you don't get to dictate how he raises the money and this is nothing new, he depends on his parents to cave. Either accept that and stay with him or leave him to find someone who can deal with him.", "YTA I think it's less to do with teaching him a lesson and more like being jealous of fact you know his family would pay for him and like you said you had to work for anything you needed.

It's none of your business, and controlling of you to stipulate that your BF can only go on vacation with you if he works for the money himself.

And now she\u2019s asking for us to cover spring break - but she\u2019s made zero attempt to earn money AT ALL while at school or while home on break.

I know many very good people who don\u2019t make a lot of money, but are upstanding and generous and awesome people.

I get the impression that\u2019s what OP is looking for. Someone who knows how to stand on their own two feet.

We started dating when we were 22, I had a full time job and he was still in college (took him 5.5 years to graduate). I'd been working multiple jobs since I was 16 and he'd never had a job in his life. At first, I wasn't very good at communicating with him about those differences ... We ended up breaking up when he was a couple months from graduation, had no resume written, no plans, spent all his time playing video games, wasn't treating me or my things (that I worked hard for) with respect (for example he damaged a brand new laptop I'd bought and was just like \"oops\"). Meanwhile, his mommy paid for everything. I worried that he was entitled/spoiled/would never grow up and didn't want to be with someone who wasn't even trying to advance from an extended college stage to the adult world.\n\nAbout a year later, he had gotten a full time job, apologized for how he treated me, we became friends again and eventually got back together. At one point, we were buying a house together and I was putting down $12k of my own savings for the down payment and his mom GIFTED him $12k for his half and I was like whaaaaat and got kinda upset about it and told him he should pay them back, even if it's interest-free and it led to a really good conversation about the differences in our upbringing, the way we view finances, etc. He pointed out that he would be able to afford an engagement ring for me more quickly because his parents were helping, and I didn't really have a good response to that \ud83d\ude02.\n\nAnyway... 5 years into our marriage, he's worked hard to earn his own way (alongside me doing the same, obviously) and there only been the occasional overwhelming financial support from his mom (the house payment was by far the biggest thing after he graduated college, but they've also contributed to our son's 529 etc). So it's worked out and it's also comforting to know his mom is there if/when we or our son needs them.\n\nSo all of that is to say 1) OP what you're feeling that is leading you to set this requirement is reasonable and I totally get it and I also know what it's like to want your partner to grow up and prove that they can make it on their own and carry their own weight but 2) setting this weird requirement is not the way to go about it. Talk to him about this, tell him how you feel. If he doesn't think it's a big deal or doesn't value your POV then just break up because you may not have a future if you can't at least understand each other. But also 3) he is only 19, it's normal for parents (who can) to still cover some expenses. And if you two DO work out in the end, take it from me that when you've never known what financial security/parental financial support feels like, it can initially feel alarming/scary and even belittling. But it is possible to BOTH be independent and self-sufficient while ALSO having financial support when parents if and when you need it.", "$5k is a lot of money for any unemployed or employed student to spend on a vacation.

Don\u2019t wait until you are engaged or married or bought a house together that you\u2019re now upside down in or have kids. Realize, \u201cThis may be a great guy but he\u2019s not a great guy for me\u201d and move on!", "Exactly. The fact that she didn\u2019t want to tell her friends makes it pretty obvious she knows she\u2019s acting like a controlling, busy-bodied asshole. YTA, OP. Get over yourself, you\u2019re not the Queen of everyone\u2019s life and behaviour. Also people need to stop throwing the word \u201centitled\u201d around when it in no way applies to the situation. If anything she\u2019s being entitled to dictating his finances. His parents want to pay, so guess what? Nunya. Stay home if it bothers you so much.", "Yeah like I'd understand if these were the conditions for moving in together or he were going into debt to join but if his parents are willing to cover expenses for a trip it's a weird thing to take such a hard stance on.", "He acts like he NEEDS a mother.  I think OP was smart. She now knows how lazy and entitled he is, and what a poor life partner he would make.", "Apparently after you turn 18, your parents are no longer allowed to buy gifts for you \ud83d\ude02.\n\nEdit: We can call it privilege because that\u2019s what it is, but entitlement??? That\u2019s another word where the real meaning is starting to get lost.", "As a college student my parents helped me a lot with the essentials. I would have never asked them to fund a fun vacation for me, especially not one that's so expensive. I do think i's entitlement especially when the boyfriend refuses to get a part-time job to help finance his own life.", "Bro, I don't know any 19 year olds that have 5k to drop on a vacation.", "Yeah, you really need to learn to mind your own business. You're trying to act like a third parent to him. It's completely ridiculous. If you think he's lazy, dump him.", "It's so obvious that you resent him for growing up the opposite way that you grew up. Just break up with him instead of being controlling.", "How entitled to think that you get to dictate how his parents provide for their son.", "YTA. I wouldn\u2019t want my kid dating someone so controlling. You act like he\u2019s 30 when he is 20 and a university student. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference in getting a job between and after studies and having to work through university. I have worked since I was 16, and there\u2019s no way I would have been able to afford a trip like that when I was 20. Grades do matter for graduate school, and while I want my kids to support themselves in the future, I would much rather fund a trip while they were a student instead of their gpa suffering.\n\nSupporting his mother wanting him to get a job over semester break is not the same.", "For sure. She is trying to \"fix\" him though.", "\"Jealous much?\"\n\nSo much jealously in this thread.", "If OP was wise she wouldn\u2019t be wasting time with him. He\u2019s also 19. I was an idiot who couldn\u2019t keep my shit together when I was that age. I think they both need some time to ripen and mature before they can count on ending up in a good, mutually trusting and supportive relationship. Too much animosity here.", ">She now knows how lazy and entitled he is, and what a poor life partner he would make.\n\nI think it's awfully early to pass that sort of judgement on a 19 year old.  Frankly, OP sounds financially irresponsible to me to expect people still in school to blow 5K each on a vacation.  BF is absolutely right that it's none of OP's business what BF's parents do with their money.  If we were talking about a $500 vacation that would be one thing, but 5K????  She sounds controlling and awful to me.  YTA.", "How is he lazy and entitled? If his parents are ok with paying for his and his brother\u2019s expenses and entertainment, that\u2019s their business. He\u2019d be entitled if his parents said no and he kept hounding them feeling they owe it to him.", "They're 19 and 20 and in college.  You should not be spending a ton of time working during that time.  I worked full time through college and suffered for it in my grades and mental health.  I'd kill to have been able to do literally anything other than pay for my own bills during what's supposed to be a time of freedom.\n\nI don't see OP as being in the right at all.  If you have parents who can help, use it.", "Yet she\u2019s still with him. Now she\u2019s also likely not terribly happy due to having a bf who doesn\u2019t feel the need to work when that\u2019s a value of hers. I\u2019m not sure op has learned the lesson she needs to yet.", "2 wrongs dont make a right, she is def the At here.", "That\u2019s really the more pertinent issue: OP can\u2019t respect a partner who isn\u2019t self-sufficient.\n\nI don\u2019t think she necessarily has a right to place limits on how he funds his recreation; but she absolutely should place limits on dating someone she doesn\u2019t respect.\n\nESH", "She is not smart. Why is she in the relationship? He might need a mother but she's not the one to be it", "OP knows what a poor life partner he is, yet she continues to date him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's not his mom.  If she doesn't like him, they should break up.", "Man, I wish I was that smart at 19. I had a boyfriend exactly  like OPs and wasted 8 years paying for his shit while urging  him to get a job. OP was dead right. If she doesn't put a stop to it now, she'll be suckered into being  his Mom in a couple of years or live with years of disappointment  and let downs. If the boyfriend  doesn't want to be treated like a child then he should  act like a grown man and get job.", "> Because I understand OP's frustration with somebody who gets lots of stuff but doesn't work for it.\n\nSounds more like jealousy to me", "Hes 19 and in college. It's a character flaw if he's not doing anything, not if hes studying full time and his parents are wealthy and happy to help out. Hes going to be working the rest of his life, the only reason OP cares is because shes jealous and resentful.", "OP herself isn't living in the real world economically if she's dropping 5k on a holiday JUST for her own expenses, while in college!!!!", "Or OP is controlling and jealous and doesn't want him to come with her unless she dictates the terms of his participation. How he gets the money is of no business of hers.", "Disagree.  There was not information in the OP that you could pull entitlement from.  You're projecting it onto them.", "This is probably the best comment in this whole post. It's not just her treating him like he is 30. So many commenters are treating this young adult who's barely started down the road of adult life like he is a grown ass man.", "I've been thinking the same thing!! I was broke broke in college, living off of student loans and minimum wage work and no car for the first two years. I worked two jobs during summer 2011 to save up $6k for a SEMESTER in Europe. Right before the pandemic I spent $4k on a two week trip to Japan (including a luxury ski trip while we were there) but that was as a working adult. I know people who backpacked weeks through SE Asia for less.\n\nWhat the hell kind of trip is OP going on if she's such a \"broke college student\"?? This sounds pretty extravagant, and to then judge her bf for asking for money for such a trip?? Girl how are YOU justifying such a big expense if you're that poor??", "Exactly. OP would want him in 5 years when he has a great job. OP YTA, you\u2019re his girlfriend, not his mum.", "Yeah, if she was smart and she actually loves this guy, she\u2019d stop trying to fix him and lock him down instead. Sad as it is, he\u2019s probably going to end up more successful no matter how lazy he might be.", "Actually she IS wrong because she's trying to \"correct\" him and tell him what to do and whether or not he can go on a trip", "You might be right, but I've not met a lot of insecurities that pay attention to logic, either. So whether she *should* let his current work experience determine whether or not to take a chance on the relationship is not an issue for me. *Should* is a setup for expectations and resentments. For reasons I know not, OP seems to be very concerned about her BF being responsible according to her definition. I was just thinking that there is probably something in her past that is driving that. Unless the 19-year-old BF wants to work through all of that with her right now, this might not be a good match for them. Not his fault. Or hers either, really. It just is. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "IMO, A lot of posts like this are speaking to economic class and capitalism issues more than anything.", "He\u2019s not mooching\u2026 lots of college degrees don\u2019t even let you get a part time job (the college doesn\u2019t let you) because they are so intense. Obviously lots of people do but your not lazy if you Dont.\n\nIn fact it\u2019s a huge advantage to your education to not have to work at the same time. Why would you chose to have a worse education if you had the option?", "OP is 20, she has a few yrs to have fun before a life long relationship. But if she's just having fun with the guy she has no say on his finances or lifestyle.\nOP I'll say YTA for trying to police your bf and his parents $ cause is none of your business. If it makes you so uncomfortable just break up with the guy", "Word.  I didn't have $500, let alone $5000 in college, and that was with working part-time night shift.  I'm not gonna be super judgmental about a 19 year old full-time student not having $5000 readily available to go on Spring Break.\n\nFor all of OP's \"woe is me; I've always been such a responsible, hard-worker and my BF isn't living up to my sTaNdArdS\", SHE is the one asking fucking 19 and 20 year olds to blow $5000 on a college trip and then acting shocked, SHOCKED, that he doesn't have it and asked his parents.   \n\nAs his parents, I would probably say no, since what 19 year old needs to go on $5000 trip, but if his parents have no objection and the money to burn....what business is it of OP's?  So, not only does OP have foolish financial expectations of the people around her, she actually thinks she gets a say in HOW said people get their money.  GTFO.  YTA.", "This. College consumes a lot of time, if you're privileged enough to have parents that can help you with some expenses, do it. Studying and working ft at the same time while you're in college is crazy, your physical and mental health will suffer trying to keep up with both.", "She sounded like she's resenting the fact that his parents willingly put out the money whenever they, both him and brother, asked. Noticed how she stated that she was working since 16 and then listed the \"expensive\" items that his parents has paid for his brother and him. OP should probably find someone else to be in a relationship with if she feels like needing a more \"mature and self sufficient\" person if she's resenting her bf for his current situation. If his family can cover his finance while he's in school without an issue, then it's their business.", "I agree with this 100%. I did 2 years of university and had 2 jobs and full time classes. I struggled with my grades and ended up dropping out after 2 years due to lack of living situation (you get kicked out of the dorms after 2yrs and I lived too far without a car), and lack of funds for tuition. \n\nI would see my friends just call up their parents and remind them that tuition was due in a few days and then go along with their fun times.  I wish I had been able to have that, maybe I would have finished college and would be living better now. \n\nSound like OP is jealous and resentful.  I think \nYTA OP", "Yeah there is no fucking way I could've raised $5000 in \\*a few months\\* while I was in college.", "That's what makes OP TA. It's not her job to teach her boyfriend to value a dollar, that's a lesson he's going to have to learn on his own. and to exclude someone (her BOYFRIEND) from a trip just because his parents hand him things is bizarre and rude.", "Unfortunately, this also fits my observations about life. \n\nMy parents were very upper middle-class, and paid my college tuition and housing while I was in school (but not summers or vacations with friends). I also worked crappy minimum wage jobs in all my free time throughout high school and college, because my dad thought it would teach me a good work ethic. Instead, going to a couple of \"elite\" private colleges in the U.S., I watched kids from families that were wealthier and/or more generous than mine work prestigious internships and land good jobs shortly after college, where I struggled for a decade before finding my footing in a well-paid job in a stable career. Because guess what? In the modern world working low-wage/low-skill jobs is not generally valued by employers with the potential to pay more. Harsh, but true.", "> no matter how lazy he might be\n\nand we don't even have enough evidence to put that label on him lol\n\nWhy has he resisted getting a job (if his parents even asked him to...I don't really trust OP as a reliable narrator tbh)? Was it to focus on studies? That would be understandable.\n\nIs it to party and play video games? Then everyone jumping to conclusions in the comments would be correct.", "While I relate to OP more than her boyfriend (in that I've been nearly continuously employed since I was 16), I also don't hold her BF having access to more resources against him (I'd rather be in that boat than the \"just scraping by\" boat).\n\nIf I could do college again with the resources, I'd be spending more time on my studies and my friends. If I didn't have to spend my free time working at that crappy barbecue shop, mowing lawns, and selling blood plasma to make the rest of my share of rent, utilities, and food, I could have made *even more* lifelong friends and contacts to help me later in my career. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIt's just a really special time in a young person's life (easily the BEST TIME to meet friends), so if I didn't have to spend that time chopping brisket for $7/hr I wouldn't have.", "IMO, A lot of this is a class issue, more than one of entitlement. A capitalism issue too. Plus from my perspective they\u2019re both young and have some natural maturing to do. Honestly, if she doesn\u2019t agree with his values that\u2019s a good learning experience to see what she likes and doesn\u2019t. As for how he gets the money to go on a trip with her and his friends, that\u2019s not really her place.", "Where do you read that's she's been BEGGING him? All I see is that she asked. My mother asked me about getting a job aswell to which I responded I didn't have time.", "OP could just break up with him if she doesn't respect his actions here. Other then that it's none of her business' if his parents give him the money", "She didn\u2019t say \u201cbeg\u201d, she said \u201cask\u201d. It\u2019s likely that they have money and want him to do well in college while simultaneously trying to get him work experience. When your parents have enough money to provide when you are young, this is a common setup. The mentality is education+experience= a better chance in the workforce and more earning potential later on. It often works. \n\nIn either case, it\u2019s by far, not the OPs place to tell him how he should get the money. Not to mention, that he is her boyfriend. Does she like him? I mean this is how he is and this is his situation. Is he supposed to miss out on a trip with her and her friends bc he didn\u2019t get the money in her approved way? Probably should just break up if they cant come to an understanding. Their values on money are quite different.", "\"Begging\"?", "Damn you really took everything OP said at face value to create that image of her boyfriend.

I don't trust her as a reliable narrator for a second", "I understand your sentiment but it sounds s little like selling out of your own pocket. There is a wide range of \"normal\" and saying otherwise speaks to your range rather than theirs.", "Your parents may have paid for you but did you ever ask them to fund the vacations for you? My parents paid for family vacations well into my adulthood, but it was always and rightfully on their terms. I would have never had the gall to ask my parents to fund a luxury trip for me.", "I understood your point. Some partners feel the need to \"FIX\" their SO so therefore must see them as \"broken\". You were suggesting that if she thinks he's broken then she should find one that isn't.  But she may be the type that thinks every boyfriend needs correction....and that it's her job to do it.", "I don't even believe that she asked. OP is not a reliable narrator, and knows that her position has no logic...so she has to put in details like that to get the audience on her side.", "Then break up with him, if what he does with his time bothers you that much. If his parents want to make the demand and cut him off, that's their decision, not yours. Do you think your relationship will survive ling beyond this? You honestly sound controlling and manipulative, with a hint of bitterness.", "Form this and other comments, it seems like you're trying to \"fix\" him which is not a healthy basis for a relationship. It sounds like your views/beliefs/lifestyle are incompatible with his, so what's really the endgame here? \n\nHe seems to be pretty entitled and knows how to get stuff from his parents, but if that's causing you to resent him to the point of keeping him out of vacation plans, then maybe you need to reevaluate the relationship?\n\nESH", "Yes that was the only reason I went on the vacations. I mean I knew they could afford them so I asked. If I knew for example my parents were poor and couldn\u2019t afford luxuries I would have never asked. I mean what was the worst that could happen, they say sorry I can\u2019t afford to have you go on vacations with your friends go get a job. I would have just said ok no problem and not gone or figured something out. Vacations were a normality for me growing up so no it wasn\u2019t weird for me to ask for them even as a young adult in college. Tbf I never said outright can I get a 5k vacation but I know they were expensive, since it was always Disney world so I don\u2019t think the prices are too off. If I had asked for a 5k vacation my parents would have told me to cut it down and I would have said ok without a fuss. I think this is where the family dynamics come in, seems like the family set a precedent that it\u2019s ok to ask for this sort of stuff.", "Lmao, Schrodinger's Teenager - good one. Lines like that are why I go on this sub.", "Enablers often give past the point of harm to themselves to make the person they're enabling happy. \n\nIt's possible that the parents can easily afford it and just want to do something nice for their son. \n\nIt's also very possible that they are and have been taking on debt that they can't afford in order to give him anything he wants."]}
