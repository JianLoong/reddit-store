Yesterday night my mom asked me if I would like to take up a part time job at her workplace arranging books and putting them up on the shelves in the nearby bookstore for the new school year for University students. (My mom doesn\u2019t work in the University itself) The pay would be $8.50 hourly which I didn\u2019t mind considering this is my first ever job. I would work from 10am-5pm, with unpaid lunch breaks from 12pm-1pm over 6 days. The total comes out to $306 for me. I was pretty excited because I would be able to buy a better phone for myself with the money I saved in my \u201cPiggy Bank\u201d as I have been using an iPhone 6 for 2 years or so now. Since it was already night time, I didn\u2019t really check with my mom about things like what would happen to the money or where I had to go, so I waited till the next day to ask her those questions and told her to sign me up. When I asked my mom whether I would be able to keep the money for myself the next day, she told me that I already had a decent amount of money saved ($150 or so) and I wouldn\u2019t need it. When I told her I wanted to use the money to buy a new phone, she got mad and said that I was being greedy by stashing so much money away that can be used for things like groceries. So I told her to forget it and I wouldn\u2019t take up the job anymore. Now she is even madder because only a handful of people signed up and the bookstore really needed all the help that they can get and that it looks bad on my mom for backing out of the job.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667472379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykyzlg/aita_for_refusing_to_work_at_my_moms_workplace/", "score": 990, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
