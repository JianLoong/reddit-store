Yesterday night my mom asked me if I would like to take up a part time job at her workplace arranging books and putting them up on the shelves in the nearby bookstore for the new school year for University students. (My mom doesn\u2019t work in the University itself) The pay would be $8.50 hourly which I didn\u2019t mind considering this is my first ever job. I would work from 10am-5pm, with unpaid lunch breaks from 12pm-1pm over 6 days. The total comes out to $306 for me. I was pretty excited because I would be able to buy a better phone for myself with the money I saved in my \u201cPiggy Bank\u201d as I have been using an iPhone 6 for 2 years or so now. Since it was already night time, I didn\u2019t really check with my mom about things like what would happen to the money or where I had to go, so I waited till the next day to ask her those questions and told her to sign me up. When I asked my mom whether I would be able to keep the money for myself the next day, she told me that I already had a decent amount of money saved ($150 or so) and I wouldn\u2019t need it. When I told her I wanted to use the money to buy a new phone, she got mad and said that I was being greedy by stashing so much money away that can be used for things like groceries. So I told her to forget it and I wouldn\u2019t take up the job anymore. Now she is even madder because only a handful of people signed up and the bookstore really needed all the help that they can get and that it looks bad on my mom for backing out of the job.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667472379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykyzlg/aita_for_refusing_to_work_at_my_moms_workplace/", "score": 225, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You work; she keeps the money??  Nope!! That\u2019s not how this works. \n\nYou are a child. She is responsible for providing for your care. You are not responsible for paying for household expenses. If you take a job, the money from that job is yours.

But don\u2019t wait around for your mom, you can apply to local stores yourself or even this bookstore if you can\u2019t find other local options.

Don't even share banks if u can help it.", "NTA.", "NTA. You could find a part-time job elsewhere with pay that you can keep.

You don't need that kind of help.", "NTA, your mom is the AT for thinking she was going to take money you worked for and you would essentially be working for free. Unless this job is going to pay you cash everyday, she can't legally do that anyway since any job you get would need your information (social security number, date of birth) and not your moms.

I'm not sure where you're from but where I'm from a 16 year old isn't expected to provide for the family, they're still a minor whose parents or guardians are supposed to provide things like groceries. I think it's ridiculous that she thinks she can make you work and then take the earnings for herself.  It might be legal, but morally, it's BS. \n\nI think it's totally reasonable that if you're not getting the paycheck from the job, that you wouldn't want to work it.  It wouldn't feel much different from slave labor.", "NTA but at 16 can you get a bank account only you have access to and arrange for direct deposit or would she have to approve and co-sign?  It may run into child labor laws for her to keep the money (as opposed to putting it in a trust fund for when you turn 18). You'd have to do research with your local labor department.\n\nNTA.", "Nta", "NTA. She's trying to make her job easier and increase her income, all for the low, low price of turning you into an indentured servant or slave.\n\nFind a job somewhere else. Make sure you get paid in a way that she can't access. You are still a child and she is still required to care for you. You can negotiate to pay board, but it should not be your entire pay.", "NTA\n\nso she wants u to work for free?

My son is 15 and got his 1st  Job at the beginning of summer. The job is to teach him about working , budgeting and saving , not so he can support our household. With his limited working he has already saved up almost $3000. I still pay for all of his essentials and he is only expected to pay for things that are extras such as extra snacks, xbox games, etc..  It is much easier to start your life with something rather than nothing and I am hoping he builds himself a good cushion for the time when he is ready to move out and start on his own.  A job at such a young age should be something that you want to do and a learning experience,  not something for your family to become dependent on.", "No you're not, your mum is stealing from you.", "NTA your mother asked you to work and you agreed, but she's going to keep the money you make?

She meant to use you as free labor", "NTA. Your wages for your work are yours. You are 16, your parents are legally obliged to provide for you, not the other way round.
