Blonde, blue eyed, etc.\n\nLara: South Asian. Dark hair, eyes, medium dark skin\n\nWe just welcomed our firstborn: Ian, now 2 months old. He's a delight.\n\nSince Lara announced her pregnancy, my SIL Jean (30s, brother's wife, 2 kids) has not shut UP about mixed race babies. Constantly bringing up that our kid will be dual heritage, how they're the \"most attractive race\", every time. After he was born, she comments on his ACTUAL looks, speculating which race he looks like each time she sees him. The other day she even commented he got darker and that his eyes darkened (VERY NORMAL IN ALL BABIES!)\n\nFyi, Jean, unlike my family, grew up in a diverse area, its not ignorance.\n\nWe aren't crybabies taking offense to everything - my family are white village folk, most are curious and excited - sometimes they ask ignorant questions and Lara especially is very gracious. We lived for a while in a region weirdly unhinged about \"race mixing\" specifically, so well meaning ignorance is a breath of fresh air lol! Hell even in our current area, after she started showing, we were stopped in the street a couple of times and told we'll make gorgeous babies - we don't mind, its well meaning (albeit intrusive), plus Lara was a model and is conventionally attractive, so that may be a factor.\n\nNot with Jean. She EXPLICITLY brings up Ian's heritage and keeps trying to analyse his features, and asking others to do it too, even after we said multiple times to stop reducing Ian to racial traits. She keeps saying she's being complimentary.\n\nLast straw, yesterday: she posted a pic of Ian from the family groupchat on her FB (friends only) and asked her mates, you guessed it, which race he looks like. And they were fucking answering. I thought that was deranged, and commented verbatim, \"don't forget to bring the calipers to dinner, Eugenics Annie, we have to commemorate Baby's first skull measurement!\"\u00a0\n\nI KNOW Jean isn't a eugenicist or even consciously racist, and its a mean thing to say in public. But we tried SO hard, implicitly, explicitly, full explanation in private - never listened to. I was worried for when Ian is old enough to understand, wanted to stop this kind of talk now. So I snapped.\n\nLara, friends and most family thought my comment was funny, but Jean and my brother are PISSED, calling us easily offended, saying we're making light of racism, refused to ever see us until I post an apology on her FB page. A couple of other relatives say I'm being harsh too, and \"cruel\" and that she meant well.\n\nAITA? I acted in anger, yet can't help feel my rudeness was justified - it's my INFANT SON. He's 2 months old, there aren't any goddamn \"racial traits\", he looks like a baby. Still, did I go too far?\n\nDon't blame you if you think I'm trolling, even I'm confused whether people can actually be this much of a freak about something thats none of their business\n\nEdit: \n\nTo the person who asked why Lara hasn't said anything, I can't seem to reply to your comment, but Lara did say it several times to Jean and in general, she \"liked\" my comment, she explicitly spoke to Jean abt thisnmore than once. I want to keep her out of this specific comment drama because I know (and she agrees) what I said on FB is something I can and will easily get away with, maybe a few people will think I'm a dickhead. But if she made that joke or even responded approvingly to my comment, it would be seen really differently... as vicious and targeted rather than a guy making a crass joke about his relative. Hell even my own friends wouldnt have found it that funny and well deserved, let alone strangers who only know Jean, whose great at turning on the tap.\n\nNot speculating either, its happened before: sometimes in the past when I've stood up for Lara in race related situations unrelated to family, some people shat on me for white knighting (less common) or assume she put me up to it (really really common even w small things). So thats why I made the harsh comment and she didnt, hope my explanation makes sense... don't want it to read like I'm \"white saviouring\" my own kid", "created_utc": 1702765818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18k2dyr/aita_for_calling_my_sil_eugenics_annie_and_not/", "score": 333, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're treating your child like a zoo animal, an exotic cross-breed that will be endlessly examined and compared.  Their level of ignorance and bigotry is staggering.  Please protect your children from them. They are horrible. \n\nYou were too kind when you berated them. Your claim that Jean is not \"consciously racist\" is at best naive. Just because she says she's not racist while behaving exactly like a racist doesn't mean she's not consciously racist. It just means she's got a canned excuse, like all racists.\n\nThe most racist things often follow the words, \"I'm not racist, but...\"", "NTA at all. I would go so far as to say that you won't see them or allow them access to your child until they apologize, drop the bullshit and agree *never* to post a picture of your child on social media without permission again, let alone for the purpose of analyzing his racial features.

In no universe can anyone consider what she did to \u201cmean well\u201d.", "NTA. Yeah, you acted in anger, but that doesn't mean your act was wrong.\n\nIt's uncomfortable to be called out for bad behaviour, it's more uncomfortable to be called out in front of others. But being made uncomfortable isn't itself a bad thing, an inherent evil; it's part of how we adapt our behaviours to get everyone in our community on the same page of what is and isn't acceptable. Arguably, this is what Jean was doing -- by continuing to make you uncomfortable with her behaviour, I would suggest she was trying to normalise it, to make it clear to you that she felt it was acceptable and that you should become comfortable with it.\n\nSo let's look at the actual actions here. You talked to her privately and gave her multiple chances to change her behaviour without repercussion. Then she went public with her behaviour and you publicly reprimanded her. More than calling her \"Eugenics Annie\" -- which is very funny, regardless of what she thinks -- you made it clear that you, the father of the infant being discussed, are Not Cool with the way Ian is being discussed.\n\nThey feel humiliated by your callout. But it's important to remember that the callout is just you saying you're not okay with that behaviour and you'd like it to stop -- yes, you did it in a colourful way, but using sarcasm isn't a crime. You didn't make light of racism, you _reprimanded_ weird racist behaviour from Jean.\n\nThis might not be a mendable bridge -- it takes two banks to build one, after all. But I think you're well justified here for pointing at the burning bridge and saying \"hey, shit's on fire, yo\", given Jean was so keen to play with matches.", "You need to stop letting people post pictures of your kid if they can\u2019t behave.

Growing up biracial (Indian and white) you pick up on these things surprisingly early, especially when the tone starts to shift. Will your SIL still \"praise\" him if he develops more South Asian features as he gets older? What about if he gets \"too dark\" or \"too light\"?\n\n IME people like this also have a weird image of how bi/multiracial should balance their different heritages, which is always the most tokenistic reductive version (we like some of your food and the pretty clothes but don't practice X,Y or Z and DEFINITELY dont ever talk about racism). Once he gets older they'll start policing his behavior as well", "NTA, and Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww", "NTA. You asked her to stop multiple times and she refused, so you had to do something different, otherwise she would just continue with her \"mixed race\" comments. And, despite what your relatives said, she did not \"mean well.\" If she did, then she wouldn't mind stopping when you asked her to. Mainly because, if she continues, your son will be seen as a series of racial traits instead of as a person as he grows up.\n\nAnd, let's face it, anyone *that* obsessed with racial traits *is* racist, despite what they claim, or they have issues with fetishizing other races.", "NTA, her behavior is insanely inappropriate and offensive and your comment was effective and to the point.  Well done!", "NTA her behavior is inexcusable", "NTA\n\nYou tried being polite and reasonable and that didn't work. It's totally understandable to snap in this situation, and hopefully the message got through this time.", "NTA and ngl if some basket case decided to crowdsource a race science Kickstarter about my newborn, I'd probably call her a lot worse than Eugenics Annie.\n\nAlso, re: your surprise at people like this existing in the UK. Oh yes they do. As a rule, the country tends to be less insane compared to many others when it comes to mixed race relationships, and are generally more tolerant. Especially on paper, we've never had a Loving v. Virginia moment due to no actual codified anti-miscegenation law, and there have even been a few mixed race relationships in the Empire days, almost exclusively with the nobility of the Indian subcontinent... see: Sophia Duleep Singh, Alys Faiz the German wife of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, a handful of others too.\n\nThis fact actually makes this kind of racism easier to hide - pretending that there was never any ill intent, that it was all a compliment! Remember, almost all the Royal Family scandals across the last century involved \"miscegenation\". Vicerine Mountbatten's affair with the Indian Prime Minister leading to the Mountbattens losing favour, Princess Diana dating a Pakistani then an Egyptian, and of course Meghan and Harry whose situation allegedly invoved comments about their unborn child's skin colour, which is exactly what your SIL is doing except she doesn't even have the excuse of being an inbred royal. The only other common denominator across all three scandals is that in all three cases, every single person baying for blood would vehemently deny that it's anything to do with the mixed race situation, there always, always was some flimsy cutesy excuse to hide behind. \n\nSorry for the pointless history lesson, I wanted to explain why it's really important you do *not* let anyone hide this exact sentiment behind a smile, because it's very easily done. It can both fuck with your son mentally *and* escalate quite horribly, especially when there are other children involved.

Umm... she's being ignorant now. She's refusing to recognize how racist she's being and how she's \"othering\" your baby. If you allow this to continue your child may start to feel like a freak of nature rather than a normal human. \n\nI would keep brother and SIL away from your kid. \n\nAlso, to your edit about why Lara didn't say something. She shouldn't have to. You should have shut this down long ago. Just like if her family is being racist towards you or y'all's kid, she shuts that down.", "NTA.  And maybe Jean IS a little racist?  If someone asks you not to say something about them related to their race or ethnicity, what kind of person dismisses it, substitutes their own opinion, and keeps doing it?", "I disagree. She is a racist.", "NTA \n\nIf a coworker refused to stop sexually harassing SIL after she told them it several times that they were making her uncomfortable, would she just let it go because it's meant \"as a compliment\"?  \n\nIgnoring both you and Lara when you have asked SIL to stop objectifying your son is NOT \"well meaning\" and the fact that she put that crap on the Internet as a GROUP ACTIVITY is an escalation, so if your comment gets her to shut up, I think it's worth it. If your brother & she insist that they won't stop, tell her the next time you hear about her discussing your child's looks or race, you will post a bathing suit picture of her and ask the public to rate her figure & features, because apparently treating human beings like objects is the new way to show you care.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nTell your brother and everyone else siding with crazy SIL, that you will consider apologizing when SIL apologizes for not stopping with her comments when directly asked and when she learns what boundaries are and how to follow them.", "NTA and this is glorious. Sometimes the polite fuck off doesn\u2019t work and you have to get increasingly impolite to achieve the desired effect.", "NTA - perhaps your quip did not go far enough?\n\nAbsolutely don't apologize. You and your family are the ones owed an apology. \n\nSeconding all the comments about posting pictures of other's kids without permission being its own layer of terrible on your SILs part in this tale.", "1: Congrats on the kiddo and I hope you and your wife are able to get some sleep sooner rather than later. I full well understand the struggle, being a father of now 5yo twins. So I\u2019m not joking about hoping you both can get some much needed rest. \n\n2: Given my dark sense of humor, I found your retort fucking hilarious. You had to bust SIL\u2019s head for not taking the multitude of warnings seriously. It was kind of an asshole comment, yet given the situation that type of comment was needed to get your point across. \n\nMy verdict: NTA. \n\nAlso, it sounds like your SIL runs your brother. Just an observation", "NTA. Jean should NOT upload pictures of your baby asking people to comment on his racial features. It's dangerous. Your SIL said she is complimenting the baby. What she is doing is \"othering\" him and that is worse especially from family. Look at the Doll Test video. It was a factor in *Brown v Board of Education*. Kids as young as 3 learn to hate their otherness and that sits with them their entire life. Don't let that happen to Ian.", "NTA\n\n>I thought that was deranged, and commented verbatim, \"don't forget to bring the calipers to dinner, Eugenics Annie, we have to commemorate Baby's first skull measurement!\" \n\nBwahahahahahahahah\n\n>Lara, friends and most family thought my comment was funny, but Jean and my brother are PISSED, calling us easily offended, saying we're making light of racism, refused to ever see us until I post an apology on her FB page.\n\nHow is calling out your SIL's crass fetishization of your child racism?\n\nShe's only pissed as she must realize now how racist she's been looking.", "NTA. It's interesting that  your SIL said you were \"making light of racism.\" You're giving her too much credit. She's consciously aware that she's being racist or it wouldn't be such an active fixation accompanied by an immediate dismissal of what you & your wife have said on the matter. If it was an unconscious, then she'd be more open to understanding you & your wife's perspective even if she didn't agree. She wouldn't be going out of her way to involve other people in analyzing your kid & bolstering her behavior. She knows better, has gotten publicly called out for her repeat behavior, & is trying to shift the blame onto you.", "NTA, and your response was hilarious.", "NTA \n\nHer racism is showing!   She may think she is not racist but to so consumed with it that she can not shut up about it.  Her need to put his picture up and get other opinions is sick.  That is not her child and she had no right to post his picture and get ratings.   \n\nI would be asking for their apology for overstepping!", "It wouldn\u2019t sting if it weren\u2019t true. Nta. Apparently this was the lowest volume Jean could hear.", "Why \u201cAnnie\u201d?", "NTA. Who does this? Good grief.", "Not the A. SIL needs to STFU about it, and to stop inviting discussion about genetics.", "NTA and congratulations on your little one! Your reply was absolute gold and made me laugh out loud. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t let them around my child for comments like that. Who makes those comments about an infant? Who posts a picture of someone else\u2019s child without their permission? And the AUDACITY to have their friends guess the race? They have shitty friends too, for actually guessing. \n\nFuck all that noise.", "NTA.  You shouldn\u2019t have to explain it to her, but you did and she still couldn\u2019t shut up. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "I had two Filipino parents. They divorced and remarried. All of my siblings are half white.\n\nWhy the actual fuck does your SIL care about the baby\u2019s face so much? The baby is both races and - no offense to be taken - a literal blob in development.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for her to be asking \u201cwhat race is baby???\u201d when she fuckin\u2019 knows you and your wife. Talking about race by *attempting to distinguish the race features on a two month old infant* is *not* anti-racist. It is encouraging others to think about the differences in race and judge each other based on racial appearances!\n\nNTA you\u2019re not racist and you have every right to tell your SIL off. She needs to mind her own business and leave your baby alone. Kid\u2019s already going to be going through enough with. You know. Existing. And being mixed race. Seriously.  You are not an AH at all.", "nah nta, your sister in law is being *weird* about your baby.", "NTA and please don\u2019t make any apologies or doubt the validity of protecting your son from racism. Trust your gut, because once your son grows up enough to be aware of the world around him he\u2019s going to face racism in ways you don\u2019t even perceive let alone understand.", "I would be more upset about her posting your kid on FB without asking permission.there are a lot of child predators out there.i would apologize for the remark but let her know future comments on childs race are just creepy and unappreciated.then I would lay into her about the kids photo post she made.i have some relatives like this who like to talk about others often.i keep them at arms length", "NTA", "pretty sick burn too, NTA", "NTA - you did not give your SIL permission to post your sons image online for people to dissect. She is weirdly obsessed with him for some reason, so incredibly focused on his race  so I can see how it makes you uncomfortable. \n\nShe needed to be called out for her constant comments about his features and race.\n\nBTW - that comment you made was hilarious!", "NTA, and I think you should say it again.", "NTA- and you might want to limit your contact with your son with his aunt.\n\nI grew up in a mixed race family.  I did not look like my cousins.  We had the same mix.  But I did not look like about 95% of my family.  \n\nAnd I knew it.  Growing up I felt like I could claim my family less.  Largely from what adults said around me about me not looking like my beloved grandmother.", "NTA\n\nYou mean, the racist is refusing to be around you until you take back accusing her of being racist?\n\nResult!\n\nRacism can mean so many different things. Sometimes, it's hateful and violent. Sometimes, it's ignorance. Sometimes, it's fetishisation. Your SIL is reducing your son to an object by repeatedly discussing his race. She is othering him by demanding that people *vote* on which race he is, implying that he is neither. All of it is damaging, disgusting, and *racist.*\n\nI'm amazed you lasted two months. Keep that vile woman *far* away from your child. He's only 2 months and doesn't realise yet what she's doing. But a child's awareness grows at a frightening speed, and the last thing you want is your hateful SIL to whisper her poison in your innocent child's ear.", "First... Congratulations on your new little munchkin. It tickled me that you called him a delight. \n\nSecond... your refusal to offer an apology saves you so much drama. I'd stand on no apology. NTA", "With the context and nuances you provided, your comment was pretty funny and I hope you finally got your point across.", "NTA. You are SUPPOSED to defend your child. If someone is creepy or bullying or racist or otherwise mean to him, it\u2019s right to stand up and call them out, every time.  Your SIL is racist. She is exoticising your son and is fetishizing mixed race babies, which is another variety of racism.", "NTA. No one should be posting a pic of your child on their social media page without your consent for starters. Her assholery just snowballed from there.", "NTA.  Totally inappropriate post from your SIL, x10 because you have asked her repeatedly to stop focusing on race.", "NTA. Racists deserve no apologies.", "As a mixed race person (not that that gives me more authority) I agree with this. As a human being I agree that when one is told one\u2019s behaviour is a problem, one should usually endeavour to correct it (not an absolute: obviously if a Klan member tells you they are offended by your attitude to race/mixed race babies, you should buy yourself a special outfit and a posh dinner out).\n\nI\u2019ve had a few (sexual) partners express fetish/excitement at my skin colour/ethnicity/mixed race heritage and it\u2019s always framed as a compliment and therefore hard to call out as the racism it really is. \n\nFetishising the physical attributes (sexually or otherwise) of a mixed race baby in this way is not really OK. It is hard to complain about a compliment - but it isn\u2019t really a compliment, is it? I think it\u2019s one thing to eg. remark on the change of a babies eye or hair colour - that always amazes me - but another thing to link it to race.\n\nI think possibly all the compliments are fine, it\u2019s just when they are anchored in a comment about race that it becomes problematic. I.e. \u201clook the babies hair is such a stunning colour\u201d is fine but \u201cthis baby has such stunning dark hair because its mother is Indian\u201d not so much.\n\nOf course in my case I may be biased because of something that happened when I was a teenager. My adopted (white) parents also adopted half Jamaican twins after me (half Mauritian). My father was a vicar, and one day I got stuck handing biscuits round at tea (the other two had vanished, the bastards). My mother showed one woman a picture of my (gorgeous) siblings and she said \u201cOh they\u2019re so beautiful; but then, first generation mixed race children are always SO beautiful!\u201d AND THEN IN THE SAME BREATH, turned to me and said \u201cAre you entirely Indian, then?\u201d I wish I could tell you that old lady died in a horrific biscuit accident that day, or that I\u2019d even had the guts to say \u201cNo. I\u2019m first generation mixed race and I\u2019m beautiful too!\u201d. Reader, I chickened out, and said something like \u201cHhaha! No. Another custard cream Mrs Vilebitch?\u201d\n\nI think my point is, this may happen to your child a lot, so you should probably draw your line in the sand and stick to it very soon. NTA.", "This right here OP. This is the way. She had no right to post pics of your child on any social media platform.", "If you block her the comment disappears. Just unfriend her", "Yeah Canada just saw its first case of AI nudes of teenage kids whose pictures had been taken from social media. Fucking horrifying.", "Also her pictures of your family, FFS", "Honestly, that reply is GOLD! 10/10 no notes", "The \"but it's a compliment\" from the SIL like... firstly it's fetishing, secondly are you saying the kid wouldn't have been cute if he looked more like one race than the other, thirdly finding the kid cute isn't an invitation to play Jeopardy!Race on Facebook, and fourthly I'd be impressed if the average 2 month old had more than 3 strands of hair and half an eyebrow, let alone distinctive racial characteristics! \n\nI actually did a double take when I read the post again and realised Jean is a mum herself, because her having experience with children that age and still expecting to find some discerning marker just screams that she considers Ian \"different\" from her own kids already. OP is right, letting SIL continue with this behaviour would really screw with his son once he starts to understand things.", "UGH that cross breed comment made me gag, you're definitely right, just so disgusting for her to think along those lines that I didn't even notice the dehumanising. Shes treating him like he's the last fucking Dodo instead of her baby nephew. Thanks for this, I completely agree with you", "    \u201cThey're treating your child like a zoo animal, an exotic cross-breed that will be endlessly examined and compared.  Their level of ignorance and bigotry is staggering.  Please protect your children from them. They are horrible.\u201d\n  \nThis is right. My kids are multi racial and I couldn\u2019t even have put that thought into words, because I never had to. Nobody ever did that to my kids, even though my family is from the Midwest and Texas. The SIL\u2019s behavior is so gross. NTA.", ">. They're treating your child like a zoo animal, an exotic cross-breed that will be endlessly examined and compared.\n\nThis is exactly right. None of this is a \"compliment\" - it's insulting.", "The animal comment is spot on \u2014 it reminded me of when people post on the dog forums asking people what breed(s) they think their dog is.", "Yes. I can still remember being sat in my grandma's apartment with my brother while she and her friends discussed which one of us looked \"more oriental\" and comparing us to our baby photos to see if we had changed race-wise since we were infants. \n\nI was very young but I was learning that there was something \"wrong\" with us because we weren't white like her.", "Thanks, that's so interesting, don't apologise. I should do some reading too, I didn't even think about that royal family drama with Harry but now that I remember it I'm like jfc how was I suprised\n\nOn the thought process, I'll be honest I had no thoughts inside my brain just pure annoyance, Eugenics Annie and the calipers was the first thing my ragebrain came up with", "I\u2019m white and my family is white. I took after my dad\u2019s side and my mom was constantly asked if she cheated on my dad (spoiler: she didn\u2019t).
