Most nights I go without dinner, and my mom does cook. Chicken, rice, pork chops, mac n cheese, tacos. But most foods smell and taste weird to me, and I can\u2019t just scarf it down. My body literally rejects it. I\u2019m speaking to my doctor about ARFID.\n\nAnyways, I finally found a food I liked. They\u2019re called pizza crunchers. I got them for school lunch, found the brand, and got my mom to buy them. They\u2019re perfect. I planned to eat these every night. Until my mom kept asking my little brother if he wanted some, and then he started liking them, and started eating them for dinner too. I looked in the box today and there were barely any left.\n\nI got upset at my mom because this is the ONE THING I like. My brother eats all this other stuff, mac n cheese, nuggets, fries, whatever my mom cooks. And we had all those things in the cabinet for him to eat as well. So I said \u201cCan you not feed him my food? This is the one thing I will eat and he has heaps of other foods he likes. Can I just have my one thing?\u201d She just responded by saying \u201cI bought them, so they\u2019re for the house, you should have ate them faster.\u201d\n\nI feel like it\u2019s not always about who buys it. It\u2019s about the fact that now I have nothing to eat tomorrow, and my little brother still has all the shit he likes sitting in the cabinet at the end of the day. This isn\u2019t a \u201che ate the last ice cream!\u201d thing, it\u2019s like, I literally wont eat anything else! The cereal is all gone. I shouldn\u2019t have to starve because my \u201clittle brother wanted some too!\u201d like thats just not fair.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit: don\u2019t be shitting on my mom too bad in the comments yall\u2026 i still love her and she\u2019s still a good woman i do not get abused or neglected i just feel like she doesn\u2019t understand the depth of my eating problems.

People who are saying Y T A are sounding like they think your restrictive diet is a choice you\u2019re making, instead of a mental health issue. I bet they wouldn\u2019t be saying stuff like this if you had to eat gluten free stuff and your brother didn\u2019t and he ate all of the stuff that didn\u2019t have gluten, leaving you without food you could safely consume.\n\nIt is the responsibility of a parent to provide their children with sufficient food. Yes, your diet makes that challenging but it\u2019s not an attitude problem, it\u2019s a health condition. You deserve to have enough food to eat every single day.\n\nI suggest you check out r/ARFID for an audience of people who understands where you\u2019re coming from and who might have ideas for how you can (very, very slowly) begin to consider introducing new foods into your diet.", "I am not even your mother and I am concerned for your health.

I can't believe these responses! \n\n1. Your mom wants to have control over what foods she provides because she buys the food. If the pizza crunchers are too expensive, sure maybe I get it. However, it sounds like she is using the fact that she \"pays for it\" as a reason to control the situation, not actually because it is a financial issue for the household.\n\n2. You live in a household where you have no assurance that even if you bought your own you could keep them. For instance, if you spent your allowance or earnings from a job on pizza crunchers, it sounds like your mom might still give them to your brother.\n\n3. You are enough of an adult to make your own choices about food. Yes, therapy is great, but it comes second to the right to personal autonomy and the freedom to make basic choices over what you put in your body.", "I don\u2019t understand your mom at all. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. \n\nI don\u2019t have AFRID but I do have ulcerative colitis and I have to be really careful about what I eat and sometimes foods make me very sick. (I can\u2019t tolerate the meds most people are on.)\n\nAfter my mom died we had ordered in dinner. There was limited choice on what I can order but I was able to get one item. I didn\u2019t finish it so my sister offered some to her BIL. Later I quietly explained that I was saving the second half because there was so little there for me to eat. But here\u2019s the thing. My sister got it! It was just days after our Mom\u2019s funeral and we still were able to discuss it reasonably. \n\nSo, try again discussing this with your mom. Your 16 and sound so reasonable that I think you should be able to discuss this maturely. I think the AFRID diagnosis should help. Maybe if your brother really likes the pizza things your mom could buy extra so there is enough for both of you. \n\nYou can also try talking to your brother. He may actually understand where you\u2019re coming from so he avoids your special foods.", "I'm on the spectrum and have food texture sensitivities omg and certain smells like fish/sea food I just can't!

My nephews (Americans) have problems with food textures, tastes etcetera and I know kids can be picky but in my country this is not really a thing. You eat a smaller portion of what is being served and that\u2019s that.", "I will be honest, never heard if ARFID, had to look it up. I have a HUGE issue myself with eating foods of a certain texture(whipped cream, souffle, mousse, flan\ud83e\udd22) so I totally get it. However, I take issue with the diet choices. How is it the only things you can eat are junk food or highly processed? How has your dr not addressed this in the past? Every year for my sons' annual check  i/they filled out a questionnaire of what they ate. Milk/dairy, servings per day, vegetables, servings per day. This cannot be good for your body or specifically your brain development. \n\nTry not to be too hard on your mom, she already has one child that won't eat and I'm sure  is terrified she'll have another. As someone that does not feed other people everyday you have no idea the effort and energy it takes. \n\nYou're 16? Driver's license? I think it's reasonable for you to take some responsibility for your food. Maybe ask for an allowance to purchase your own groceries. You should definitely be preparing your own meals, this would relieve some pressure off your mom and when you start realizing how hard getting a meal on the table is, you might start finding new food options u can live with.", "My stepson is an insanely picky eater - not because ARFID but because his mom spoils him and thinks her baby boy doesn't need \"yucky healthy food\" as she calls it, by her own admission. He eats chicken nuggets, fries, hot dogs, hash browns, pizza, ice cream, candy, and chocolate ensure (to replace all the vitamins he isn't getting from regular food - because his pediatrician has threatened to call child services due to her neglect of his health. She thinks this is stupid and only gives him one a week. Yeaaaaah....). For the longest time, that was all he'd eat. We'd offer him veggies or fruits, not making a big deal, just putting them on his sectioned plate and if he doesn't eat it, he doesn't eat it. As soon as he sees them, he tantrums and shoves his hand in his mouth, forcing himself to puke. It got so severe that I, my SO, and my daughter couldn't eat at the same time as him, because if he sees US with other food, he flips out. He has to sit in a different room for lunch and snacktime at school because he bullies other children about their food if it's not what he likes. THAT'S a picky eater.\n\nAnd you know what I do? I make sure my **STEPSON** - who I have no relation too, barely know, and absolutely care about but not specifically parentally love - always has food at our house that he can eat. Always. I hate his eating habits and find them genuinely repulsive and concerning, but he ALWAYS has his \"safe foods\" at our house. I finally convinced him to try some other stuff and he now eats 3 different kinds of fruit, and 3 different kinds of veggie crackers. His bio-mom is blown away by it and he still refuses to eat them at her house. But twice a week, during his visits with his dad, his stepmom(me) makes damn sure he has what he'll eat. Because that what you fucking do for children in your care.\n\nSo no, NTA. I absolutely think that your mom has the right to feed your brother whatever she wants. But not at the expense of you. She should be making sure ALL of her family can eat. Even if you were \"just picky for funzies\", how is she ok with even the thought of her child not eating? I look at my 8F, 5M stepson, and 6moF kids, and just the idea that they might be forced to go hungry because someone *disagrees with their choices* makes me want to cry.", "Speak to your doctor.

Try a few different baked dishes with only a few ingredients so you have more options, but your mother is being unfair.

This is an ongoing medical emergency and they should be treating it with more urgency. Receiving enough nourishment at this age is important to ensure your health as an adult.\n\nIf it's possible, take a look at the main ingredients, flavors, and textures represented in your safe foods. See if there are any patterns, and try to find other foods that fall within those parameters. Try foods with very few ingredients so you can isolate flavors/textures/etc. Take it one bite at a time. As someone who had an ED in the past and presently has GI issues, eating can be really difficult sometimes.

You're heading towards an early grave with that kind of unhealthy eating habit. You need to work towards having a healthier diet. \n\nYou can look it up. Your body will start to shut down. Your organs will literally start to fail. Your body is not getting the vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly. You will start to lose your vision, hearing, etc, and it can lead to death if you do not address it. You didn't feel the effects as much as a child because children are just very resilient, but as you age the signs will become more apparent as your body starts to lose the ways it can compensate for the lack of nutrients. You yourself claim to have severely stunted growth and suffer from fatigue.

One of my sons has difficulty with many foods, and there are few foods he actually enjoys. The other is less picky.

Your mother\u2019s apathy towards your health and wellness tells me she\u2019s probably the reason your picky eating has escalated to an ED. Children need to be exposed to a wide variety of foods starting from right when they can eat solid foods. Parents need to push for proper nutrition even if that is against the child\u2019s desire to solely eat junk food. The point is: your parents have been allowing this disordered behavior for far too long. If conventional methods of getting you to eat properly weren\u2019t working, they should\u2019ve sought the help of child psychologists and nutritionists long ago. Allowing this to go unchecked for this long is completely unsustainable and unhealthy.

It's a very serious condition, and the fact you were willing to try something new and found something you can eat is fantastic. Because your diet is so limited, every food you are able to eat should always be available; her being willing to let you go without supper so regularly is child neglect. Your food should be available to your brother only if there is so much of it and it will be replenished before there's a chance of running out - telling you you \"should have eaten them faster\" indicates that she thinks this is a preference and not a medical condition.

It sounds like there are other food options that you can eat, not that 1 single item, and you didn't buy it. That may have been what you WANTED, but I highly doubt there's absolutely nothing else you can eat. Quite frankly, you sound like a spoiled brat here.

I have, as a result of this, in an irregular z-line in my esophagus as a result of all the acid that has come up. This puts me at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer.

Not just in a \u201cI don\u2019t like vegetables\u201d way but in a \u201cI only eat 5 things and if I eat anything outside of those 5 things I\u2019ll throw up\u201d way. Most nights I go without dinner, and my mom does cook. Chicken, rice, pork chops, mac n cheese, tacos. But most foods smell and taste weird to me, and I can\u2019t just scarf it down. My body literally rejects it. I\u2019m speaking to my doctor about ARFID.\n\nAnyways, I finally found a food I liked. They\u2019re called pizza crunchers. I got them for school lunch, found the brand, and got my mom to buy them. They\u2019re perfect. I planned to eat these every night. Until my mom kept asking my little brother if he wanted some, and then he started liking them, and started eating them for dinner too. I looked in the box today and there were barely any left.\n\nI got upset at my mom because this is the ONE THING I like. My brother eats all this other stuff, mac n cheese, nuggets, fries, whatever my mom cooks. And we had all those things in the cabinet for him to eat as well. So I said \u201cCan you not feed him my food? This is the one thing I will eat and he has heaps of other foods he likes. Can I just have my one thing?\u201d She just responded by saying \u201cI bought them, so they\u2019re for the house, you should have ate them faster. You need to try new things.\u201d I\u2019m upset because this was my new thing. This was literally my one food. My little brother wouldn\u2019t have \u201cliked\u201d them if she didn\u2019t ask him to try them. It feels insensitive. Like you know I\u2019ve had problems with food my whole life and now the one food I like besides cereal and fast food is getting ate up.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That, however, does not make what OP appears to be demanding reasonable.\n\nDoctor involvement, formal testing, and proper diagnosis should have been done as soon as this narrow diet was realized. That it was delayed this long is unacceptable. Again, I'm not a medical professional. I am simply someone who's being treated by specialists for gastrointestinal issues, issues with my weight, and an eating disorder. I I knew there was an issue when I couldn't eat anything but gluten-free Bagels or drink anything but Ginger Beer. I immediately brought this concern to my doctor who sent me to a specialist. There is no shame in needing Specialist Care. Requesting that no one in the house be allowed to eat a specific food, despite it being bought by a parent, is unreasonable no matter your age. My sister did this. My sister has a limited diet. I would always ask for permission before eating one of her food items. Additionally, I had special food items at a time. I ate gluten-free for about a year trying to determine if gluten was a contributing factor to migraines. Some gluten-free foods were also good for my family to eat, and I happily shared them with my parents and sister.

Why are you saying you will \"starve\" just because this particular box got over?", "So, out of curiosity, how frequently do you actually try new foods? It doesn't sound like it's frequent, from your posts. You managed to find these pizza crunchers through a school lunch, so you're clearly able to try things. At least, you're able to try them if they're junk food. To be perfectly honest, I think you've shoehorned yourself into eating a very narrow subset of foods, and your body simply doesn't know how to tolerate things that aren't full of saturated fat, anymore. It isn't an uncommon phenomenon, either. You see it all the time with vegetarians transitioning back to eating meat. It can take a long time for their body to adjust to eating it again. They'll feel sick, bloated, nauseous, and crampy for weeks, while their body sorts things out. I honestly suspect that you're dealing with that, rather than ARFID, especially because you used to eat a lot of other foods, based on your posts. You've convinced yourself that you can't eat anything else, and you're essentially creating a self fulfilling prophecy. You believe so strongly that you'll hate the food and gag on it, that you make yourself gag on it. It isn't a conscious thing, but your brain has convinced itself that this scenario must be true, and acts on it.\n\nLook, I do understand. I am on the spectrum, and I can be an incredibly picky eater. I'll go through weeks and weeks where I will default to eating the same thing over, and over, and over again. It's currently Rice Krispies and blueberries. A couple of months ago, it was french toast. The month before that, it was macaroni and cheese. Every day, multiple times a day, the exact same thing. It didn't mean that I couldn't eat other things, but it did sometimes take some time to get used to adding other textures and flavours back into my diet. I love certain foods, and it still takes time. There are also some foods that I truly cannot eat, for one reason or another. That being said, I can also tell you exactly why I don't like the things that I do, and it's more than just 'it smelled weird.' I can tell you that I don't like shrimp because the texture feels lobey in my mouth. I don't like scallops or mushrooms because of the rubbery texture. I dislike kale because it's bitter. I dislike tomato slices because they're slimy, but they're fine if they're diced and rinsed, because the slime is cleared off. That being said, I don't let it stop me from at least trying new things. I've found a lot of things that I actually really enjoy, that way. \n\nYou really need to be trying new things, rather than going 'I can only eat this.' Start going 'I'm going to try this, and I have this other option if it doesn't work.' If you're able to eat pancakes, try adding chocolate chips or blueberries to them, or adding syrup to the top. Try crepes or waffles instead of pancakes, because you can make them from the same batter. If you can eat cereal, try a new brand, or try adding fruit to it. If you can eat one brand of pizza, try it in a different flavour, or try adding a new topping to it\n Try one new thing every week, and you might be surprised by what you end up enjoying. You found the pizza crunchers by trying them, and there's nothing stopping you from trying more things. The only way to find new things you're comfortable with is by stepping outside of your comfort zone, and actually trying them.\n\nI'm not going to say that you're an AH, although some of your comments pushed me very close to thinking that way. You seem frustrated, but you also seem arrogant, in some ways. Your comments about deserving special treatment really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mother is obligated to provide food for you, yes. She is not, however, obligated to restrict the food your brother eats. You say that you're 16, and that's more than old enough to get a job. If you require certain foods, go out and buy them for yourself. Your mother has to provide you with food, but it doesn't have to be your favourite food. As you've said, there are pizza crunchers left, if not many, and there are sausages. There are foods that you can eat, you just don't want to. You could have sausages for dinner for one night, it's not going to kill you. If you want pancakes more, go earn some money and buy pancake mix. You're complaining about the fact that you have no food to eat, while also saying that you have food, but you don't want it for dinner. That, to me, makes you come off as very, very bratty. Your mother is obligated to provide you with food, which she has done. She is not obligated to provide you with different foods for breakfast and dinner, when she's already cooking for the rest of your family. She's giving you food that you can eat, but you're stuck with her choices. If you want the freedom to make your own choices, go and make them. Get a job, and buy your choice of foods, if your mothers options aren't what you want.", "I honestly cannot wrap my head around the fact that no one single adult in your life has stepped in to help/raise concern.

If you would have grown up in different circumstances, there might have been no processed foods available and you would have been glad about every bite you get, no matter what it is.\n\nPlease consider working on that. The world will not cater to your 6 preferred foods. You need to be able to eat everything. \n\nI don't say that you were spoiled, but this issue should have been solved a long time ago. Nobody did you a favor by supporting those eating habits. They only made it more difficult for you in the future.", "You are indeed 16. Question: did you buy that food? Did you die when your little brother ate those pizza whatever-you-call-them? Did your mom say she won't go and get more from the store with HER money? Is she imposing that food on your brother or did she not offer it to him? Are you so aggrieved that your mother offered food to your little brother and he also happened to like them? If you saw anyone else who can eat rice, Mac n cheese and pork eating the brand of pizza whatevers that you like, would you feel just as aggrieved because they are eating that when that's the only thing you eat? What if that company decides they don't want to produce them anymore so there are only a few boxes left, will you also gatekeep those just because you think deserve them more because you are a picky eater so everyone should just bow at your feet and give you all the boxes left in this world? I hope all your answers are a big, resounding NO. Because if that is the case, you need to grow up and realise the world doesn't revolve around you. Your world revolves around you. But this one, the one we all live in, that one we all share.\n\nLet me tell you this, young one. Your mom offered your little brother that food because, believe it or not, your little brother is her child as well. She wants to see if he will also like them. She is making it so that there is an even amount of importance placed on both of you. Please be kind to your little brother. You are his older sister. Please love your little brother enough to share this with him. If you can't share it with him, whom do you want to share it with? And I dont understand what this illnesss you have is, and I'm sorry if it limits you to a few food groups, but perhaps it's best you inform or talk to your mom that she might need to get some more since your little brother also likes them. Put your point across without excluding the other child and your mom might follow your advice. But if you haven't spoken to your mother that she should buy some more since you siblings all like them, it's about time you did. That way everyone wins. You get your \"among the few\" foods you can eat, your little brother gets his \"for the moment\" favorite thing to eat, and your mom sees both if her kids are happy.\n\nIn conclusion, yes.

It isn't anywhere near as bad as you, but it is not uncommon for me to go months or even a couple of years eating only two different meals for almost all meals. I don't want to eat most things most of the time, and find the idea of eating a lot of things unpleasant and will sometimes throw up if I try. It is hard to eat where someone else cooks for me. \n\nI often throw up, and this is getting worse, often after eating (though also psychological triggers, like seeing something that disgusts me, or remembering something, and also physical triggers, like brushing my teeth or anything too far back in my mouth or in my mouth for too long). \n\nIt isn't that I don't want to eat - I have a strong appetite.\n\nI was exposed to a ridiculously wide range of things when I was a kid, and will eat a lot of things other people won't, so it isn't the classic thing people think of of not being exposed to a range of things young. My mum used to cook a wide range of things, and I had tried more things by when I was 2 than most people do in their lifetime I think. My siblings aren't like this.\n\nI have a very strong aversion to some things. The worst (partly because it is so common, and partly because my aversion is so strong) is most cheese. My brother doubted it made much difference when I was about 8, and put a tiny crumb of it into the batter of a pancake I ate. It was about 0.5mm in diameter and melted into the batter of a pancake the size of a plate, but I threw up and instantly knew there was cheese in it when I started eating it. My mum insisted there wasn't and I was imagining it, but I was resolute that it had cheese in it, and eventually my brother confessed, saying he'd done it because he didn't think I'd be able to tell and that he was going to tell me after I ate it. It isn't all dairy (I dislike drinking milk on its own, and can't without vomiting, and this was forced on me when I was a kid at school, so is probably worse because of that, but other than that, dairy is fine) or even all cheese (mascapone is fine for some reason). It is a very strong taste to me that I can't stand.\n\nI likely (psychiatrist says so, and seems very sure, but says a specialist in this should diagnose me really) have an autistic spectrum disorder. I don't know if this is related. \n\nFood is very important to me - it is a significant source of pleasure, and I like trying new things (cautiously), and have a strong appetite. It isn't that I have a body image problem causing me to not want to eat things. Unhealthy things like crisps and chocolate are more likely to be appealing (I guess like most people). It isn't that I don't have a strong appetite - I do.\n\nI often feel that I need to eat something familiar of a particular taste to sort of cleanse my palete after eating, because even the residual taste in a weaker form of what I just enjoyed eating, or even the memory of it, can be triggering for throwing up. I often eat medium dark chocolate after eating (not like 70+% but not milk chocolate either, normal dark chocolate), for example. \n\nI also get heartburn even when I'm not feeling like throwing up. When I say feeling like throwing up, I don't mean feeling nauseated, I mean feeling the urge to vomit or like I am right about to vomit - I don't have the other symptoms of nausea. \n\nI'm not sure if any of this is similar to you, and if it is in any way helpful if so - I don't have much of a solution. I've recently started to see a doctor about it because of the problem getting worse in the last few months, and they have suggested tests for a bacterial infection in my stomach, and antibiotics if I have it, and proton pump inhibitors and cognitive behavioural therapy if not. I haven't even had the test yet though.\n\nI suggest that you try to sort it somehow. You can't live on the same thing all the time. I have had health issues from eating the same stuff, and it'll get worse as you get older. It is also super inconvenient. \n\nTo answer your question: I do think your mum and brother are being insensitive to what seems like a genuinely serious problem, but I also think your parents should probably be trying to help widen what you can eat and sort it. \n\nHave you ever been made to eat things you don't want to, and how has this affected your ability to eat them in future? \n\nDo you take vitamin/mineral tablets to try to get essential nutrients? How is your weight, if you don't mind me asking?", "Thank you", "Wtf? Ops brothers behaviour of eating foods the mum bought for the household should be \"slapped down\"? \nI was also a very picky eater. I also had siblings. Why should my siblings be punished for not being picky eaters? That makes absolutely no sense. \nThe parents are providing meals, that's not neglect. Honestly I'm jealous of op that she's allowed to just skip meals instead of being forced to sit at the dinner table for hours trying to swallow bits of food like pills to keep it down. \nYou guys are so fucking dramatic", "\"I'm speaking to my doctor\" sounds more like chatting than committing. She's 16, and this kind of problem doesn't rise in one day (if so, could be something way more severe). So, someone failed here: her or her parents. In both cases, like she was able to go on Reddit and create a post, she can search a specialist or find different diets and recipes to try online. Again, if you're concerned about your health, you don't come to Reddit to whine about some food.", "Hi OP: as others have mentioned, the lack of micronutrients in your diet will be quite concerning for your general health. Many of us who eat a full range of food will still take supplements as a \"top up\", so it's probably quite likely that the supplements you're taking just aren't enough. There are also a multitude of reasons why your energy levels might be low, so I **really** hope that your doctor is doing their due diligence with you in terms of assessing your  complete health needs? Doing a full blood workup to check all the various health markers? \n\nI'm also really hoping that you've already heard this, but in case you haven't: whenever a person's diet is restricted (for whatever reason, be it an eating disorder, allergies, religious beliefs, or lifestyle choices), it limits your access to the fundamental building blocks your body needs in order to function, grow, and repair - i.e. essential vitamins and minerals. This means you **need** to be *very* engaged with finding sources for these that your body will accept, even if it means \"tricking\" your brain/body.\n\nE.g : with the pancakes, have you tried whether or not you are able to tolerate added ingredients? Things that people add for a nutritional boost include protein powder (substitute for a portion of the flour), banana (if you're able to blend it with milk in a blender it's very smooth, compared to mashed banana which can be a bit chunky), high protein yoghurt, berries, spinach, ground nuts, beetroot / carrot (either boiled then blended, or just use the juice) - if you have a blender you really can get quite creative, with textures ranging anywhere between \"fluffy hot cakes\" and \"moist crepes\" (if you add lots of moist ingredients then just increase the amount of baking powder). For taste you can also add things like cinnamon, vanilla essence, or even just cocoa powder to make it look and taste like chocolate pancakes. And for looks you can either play with colours (eg red pancakes one day [berries, beetroot, carrot], green/savoury pancakes another day [spinach, peas]). \n\nEven just substituting some flour for a bit of protein powder will be better than nothing.\n\nBut yea, really hoping you've got a proper health team to support you (i.e. not just your doctor, but also a nutritionist, and maybe an endocrinologist and an acupuncturist), just to support your body from every possible angle to help you get yourself to better state of health. I've seen in another of your comments that you stopped growing at around 11/12yo, and that's really the time that most people really start puberty, and hit some major adolescent growth spurts (not the time that people \"stop\" growing). As a parent your health situation really worries me, and I really hope you're getting all the support you need, and not just the bare minimum. You deserve to thrive, and to have the energy to think and do all the things that you want to. A life without energy isn't living. Please keep fighting for your health, because it's absolutely worth it. **You** are worth it. And though it's not an easy road you're on, you *can* do this.

When people have sensory issues, natural flavors and textures might feel too \"loud.\" And yes, you can indeed sustain life on processed food and vitamins. Of course, an improved food repertoire is always the goal, but fed is best. Further, you don't know all her safe foods and some cereals are more nutritious than others. She said she feels sick when she eats unsafe foods, which is also common in ARFID/sensory difficulties. Since she has, presumably, been eating less from a young age, she wouldn't have a sudden 20% decrease in weight. Perhaps she has been chronically underweight her entire life. Perhaps her own pediatrician noted that she was failure-to-thrive. Or maybe she is in a disadvantaged situation where she doesn't have access to good medical care for whatever reason. We don't know.

It is not uncommon for parents to see picky eating as a character flaw rather than a symptom of sensory issues or anxiety. CPS isn't going to remove a child from a situation like that. Ideally they will, however, attempt to educate the parent and provide resources. I have seen situations where children were not going to school, not receiving nutritious food, and not being supervised and CPS did not intervene because there was no imminent threat to life.
