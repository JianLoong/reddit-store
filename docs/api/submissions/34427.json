Most nights I go without dinner, and my mom does cook. Chicken, rice, pork chops, mac n cheese, tacos. But most foods smell and taste weird to me, and I can\u2019t just scarf it down. My body literally rejects it. I\u2019m speaking to my doctor about ARFID.\n\nAnyways, I finally found a food I liked. They\u2019re called pizza crunchers. I got them for school lunch, found the brand, and got my mom to buy them. They\u2019re perfect. I planned to eat these every night. Until my mom kept asking my little brother if he wanted some, and then he started liking them, and started eating them for dinner too. I looked in the box today and there were barely any left.\n\nI got upset at my mom because this is the ONE THING I like. My brother eats all this other stuff, mac n cheese, nuggets, fries, whatever my mom cooks. And we had all those things in the cabinet for him to eat as well. So I said \u201cCan you not feed him my food? This is the one thing I will eat and he has heaps of other foods he likes. Can I just have my one thing?\u201d She just responded by saying \u201cI bought them, so they\u2019re for the house, you should have ate them faster.\u201d\n\nI feel like it\u2019s not always about who buys it. It\u2019s about the fact that now I have nothing to eat tomorrow, and my little brother still has all the shit he likes sitting in the cabinet at the end of the day. This isn\u2019t a \u201che ate the last ice cream!\u201d thing, it\u2019s like, I literally wont eat anything else! The cereal is all gone. I shouldn\u2019t have to starve because my \u201clittle brother wanted some too!\u201d like thats just not fair.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit: don\u2019t be shitting on my mom too bad in the comments yall\u2026 i still love her and she\u2019s still a good woman i do not get abused or neglected i just feel like she doesn\u2019t understand the depth of my eating problems.

People who are saying Y T A are sounding like they think your restrictive diet is a choice you\u2019re making, instead of a mental health issue. I bet they wouldn\u2019t be saying stuff like this if you had to eat gluten free stuff and your brother didn\u2019t and he ate all of the stuff that didn\u2019t have gluten, leaving you without food you could safely consume.\n\nIt is the responsibility of a parent to provide their children with sufficient food. Yes, your diet makes that challenging but it\u2019s not an attitude problem, it\u2019s a health condition. You deserve to have enough food to eat every single day.\n\nI suggest you check out r/ARFID for an audience of people who understands where you\u2019re coming from and who might have ideas for how you can (very, very slowly) begin to consider introducing new foods into your diet.", "I am not even your mother and I am concerned for your health.

I can't believe these responses! \n\n1. Your mom wants to have control over what foods she provides because she buys the food. If the pizza crunchers are too expensive, sure maybe I get it. However, it sounds like she is using the fact that she \"pays for it\" as a reason to control the situation, not actually because it is a financial issue for the household.\n\n2. You live in a household where you have no assurance that even if you bought your own you could keep them. For instance, if you spent your allowance or earnings from a job on pizza crunchers, it sounds like your mom might still give them to your brother.\n\n3. You are enough of an adult to make your own choices about food. Yes, therapy is great, but it comes second to the right to personal autonomy and the freedom to make basic choices over what you put in your body.", "I don\u2019t understand your mom at all. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. \n\nI don\u2019t have AFRID but I do have ulcerative colitis and I have to be really careful about what I eat and sometimes foods make me very sick. (I can\u2019t tolerate the meds most people are on.)\n\nAfter my mom died we had ordered in dinner. There was limited choice on what I can order but I was able to get one item. I didn\u2019t finish it so my sister offered some to her BIL. Later I quietly explained that I was saving the second half because there was so little there for me to eat. But here\u2019s the thing. My sister got it! It was just days after our Mom\u2019s funeral and we still were able to discuss it reasonably. \n\nSo, try again discussing this with your mom. Your 16 and sound so reasonable that I think you should be able to discuss this maturely. I think the AFRID diagnosis should help. Maybe if your brother really likes the pizza things your mom could buy extra so there is enough for both of you. \n\nYou can also try talking to your brother. He may actually understand where you\u2019re coming from so he avoids your special foods.", "I'm on the spectrum and have food texture sensitivities omg and certain smells like fish/sea food I just can't!

My nephews (Americans) have problems with food textures, tastes etcetera and I know kids can be picky but in my country this is not really a thing. You eat a smaller portion of what is being served and that\u2019s that.", "I will be honest, never heard if ARFID, had to look it up. I have a HUGE issue myself with eating foods of a certain texture(whipped cream, souffle, mousse, flan\ud83e\udd22) so I totally get it. However, I take issue with the diet choices. How is it the only things you can eat are junk food or highly processed? How has your dr not addressed this in the past? Every year for my sons' annual check  i/they filled out a questionnaire of what they ate. Milk/dairy, servings per day, vegetables, servings per day. This cannot be good for your body or specifically your brain development. \n\nTry not to be too hard on your mom, she already has one child that won't eat and I'm sure  is terrified she'll have another. As someone that does not feed other people everyday you have no idea the effort and energy it takes. \n\nYou're 16? Driver's license? I think it's reasonable for you to take some responsibility for your food. Maybe ask for an allowance to purchase your own groceries. You should definitely be preparing your own meals, this would relieve some pressure off your mom and when you start realizing how hard getting a meal on the table is, you might start finding new food options u can live with.", "My stepson is an insanely picky eater - not because ARFID but because his mom spoils him and thinks her baby boy doesn't need \"yucky healthy food\" as she calls it, by her own admission. He eats chicken nuggets, fries, hot dogs, hash browns, pizza, ice cream, candy, and chocolate ensure (to replace all the vitamins he isn't getting from regular food - because his pediatrician has threatened to call child services due to her neglect of his health. She thinks this is stupid and only gives him one a week. Yeaaaaah....). For the longest time, that was all he'd eat. We'd offer him veggies or fruits, not making a big deal, just putting them on his sectioned plate and if he doesn't eat it, he doesn't eat it. As soon as he sees them, he tantrums and shoves his hand in his mouth, forcing himself to puke. It got so severe that I, my SO, and my daughter couldn't eat at the same time as him, because if he sees US with other food, he flips out. He has to sit in a different room for lunch and snacktime at school because he bullies other children about their food if it's not what he likes. THAT'S a picky eater.\n\nAnd you know what I do? I make sure my **STEPSON** - who I have no relation too, barely know, and absolutely care about but not specifically parentally love - always has food at our house that he can eat. Always. I hate his eating habits and find them genuinely repulsive and concerning, but he ALWAYS has his \"safe foods\" at our house. I finally convinced him to try some other stuff and he now eats 3 different kinds of fruit, and 3 different kinds of veggie crackers. His bio-mom is blown away by it and he still refuses to eat them at her house. But twice a week, during his visits with his dad, his stepmom(me) makes damn sure he has what he'll eat. Because that what you fucking do for children in your care.\n\nSo no, NTA. I absolutely think that your mom has the right to feed your brother whatever she wants. But not at the expense of you. She should be making sure ALL of her family can eat. Even if you were \"just picky for funzies\", how is she ok with even the thought of her child not eating? I look at my 8F, 5M stepson, and 6moF kids, and just the idea that they might be forced to go hungry because someone *disagrees with their choices* makes me want to cry.", "Speak to your doctor.

Try a few different baked dishes with only a few ingredients so you have more options, but your mother is being unfair.

This is an ongoing medical emergency and they should be treating it with more urgency. Receiving enough nourishment at this age is important to ensure your health as an adult.\n\nIf it's possible, take a look at the main ingredients, flavors, and textures represented in your safe foods. See if there are any patterns, and try to find other foods that fall within those parameters. Try foods with very few ingredients so you can isolate flavors/textures/etc. Take it one bite at a time. As someone who had an ED in the past and presently has GI issues, eating can be really difficult sometimes.

You're heading towards an early grave with that kind of unhealthy eating habit. You need to work towards having a healthier diet. \n\nYou can look it up. Your body will start to shut down. Your organs will literally start to fail. Your body is not getting the vitamins and minerals it needs to function properly. You will start to lose your vision, hearing, etc, and it can lead to death if you do not address it. You didn't feel the effects as much as a child because children are just very resilient, but as you age the signs will become more apparent as your body starts to lose the ways it can compensate for the lack of nutrients. You yourself claim to have severely stunted growth and suffer from fatigue.

One of my sons has difficulty with many foods, and there are few foods he actually enjoys. The other is less picky.

Your mother\u2019s apathy towards your health and wellness tells me she\u2019s probably the reason your picky eating has escalated to an ED. Children need to be exposed to a wide variety of foods starting from right when they can eat solid foods. Parents need to push for proper nutrition even if that is against the child\u2019s desire to solely eat junk food. The point is: your parents have been allowing this disordered behavior for far too long. If conventional methods of getting you to eat properly weren\u2019t working, they should\u2019ve sought the help of child psychologists and nutritionists long ago. Allowing this to go unchecked for this long is completely unsustainable and unhealthy.

It's a very serious condition, and the fact you were willing to try something new and found something you can eat is fantastic. Because your diet is so limited, every food you are able to eat should always be available; her being willing to let you go without supper so regularly is child neglect. Your food should be available to your brother only if there is so much of it and it will be replenished before there's a chance of running out - telling you you \"should have eaten them faster\" indicates that she thinks this is a preference and not a medical condition.

It sounds like there are other food options that you can eat, not that 1 single item, and you didn't buy it. That may have been what you WANTED, but I highly doubt there's absolutely nothing else you can eat. Quite frankly, you sound like a spoiled brat here.

I have, as a result of this, in an irregular z-line in my esophagus as a result of all the acid that has come up. This puts me at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer.

Not just in a \u201cI don\u2019t like vegetables\u201d way but in a \u201cI only eat 5 things and if I eat anything outside of those 5 things I\u2019ll throw up\u201d way. Most nights I go without dinner, and my mom does cook. Chicken, rice, pork chops, mac n cheese, tacos. But most foods smell and taste weird to me, and I can\u2019t just scarf it down. My body literally rejects it. I\u2019m speaking to my doctor about ARFID.\n\nAnyways, I finally found a food I liked. They\u2019re called pizza crunchers. I got them for school lunch, found the brand, and got my mom to buy them. They\u2019re perfect. I planned to eat these every night. Until my mom kept asking my little brother if he wanted some, and then he started liking them, and started eating them for dinner too. I looked in the box today and there were barely any left.\n\nI got upset at my mom because this is the ONE THING I like. My brother eats all this other stuff, mac n cheese, nuggets, fries, whatever my mom cooks. And we had all those things in the cabinet for him to eat as well. So I said \u201cCan you not feed him my food? This is the one thing I will eat and he has heaps of other foods he likes. Can I just have my one thing?\u201d She just responded by saying \u201cI bought them, so they\u2019re for the house, you should have ate them faster. You need to try new things.\u201d I\u2019m upset because this was my new thing. This was literally my one food. My little brother wouldn\u2019t have \u201cliked\u201d them if she didn\u2019t ask him to try them. It feels insensitive. Like you know I\u2019ve had problems with food my whole life and now the one food I like besides cereal and fast food is getting ate up.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That, however, does not make what OP appears to be demanding reasonable.\n\nDoctor involvement, formal testing, and proper diagnosis should have been done as soon as this narrow diet was realized. That it was delayed this long is unacceptable. Again, I'm not a medical professional. I am simply someone who's being treated by specialists for gastrointestinal issues, issues with my weight, and an eating disorder. I I knew there was an issue when I couldn't eat anything but gluten-free Bagels or drink anything but Ginger Beer. I immediately brought this concern to my doctor who sent me to a specialist. There is no shame in needing Specialist Care. Requesting that no one in the house be allowed to eat a specific food, despite it being bought by a parent, is unreasonable no matter your age. My sister did this. My sister has a limited diet. I would always ask for permission before eating one of her food items. Additionally, I had special food items at a time. I ate gluten-free for about a year trying to determine if gluten was a contributing factor to migraines. Some gluten-free foods were also good for my family to eat, and I happily shared them with my parents and sister.

Her mother could have spoken up and said the same thing just worded a little differently.

Blaming a CHILD for not knowing beyond what they\u2019ve been taught is literally insane. You make it sound so easy to advocate for oneself, when it certainly isn\u2019t, especially in the case of toxic/abusive family dynamics. You have a very privileged view of life to be blaming a kid for not being more responsible for their life, when it is the responsibility of the PARENT to recognise that something is not right.

They also have mandatory reporting duties, so again, CPS would be involved. Once you lose 20% of your body weight, feeding tubes would have been a topic of discussion. If you've never gained weight properly, you wouldn't be on just multivitamins and iron, but also prescription appetite stimulants, such as Cyproheptadine.
