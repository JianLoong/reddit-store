I was very ill for almost a year, and very very overworked and lost about 20 pounds without really trying I have always been very fit, and very into the gym, so I have muscle and really I feel like a lot of people maybe thought that I tried to lose weight but I didn\u2019t.  I was asked continuously at work how I did it, when I responded that I have health issues people just kind of backed off.  Except her.  She talks about my body everytime I work with her.  I have zero body issues, so at first it didn\u2019t phase me at all- as I talk to people at the gym all the time about workouts and aesthetics, but it\u2019s become a continuous thing with her where she asks me what I ate for lunch, what I eat, is surprised when I\u2019m eating a damn donut or cookie- and constantly asks me about my body. \n\nRecently, I have been working pretty hard in the gym to put on some healthy weight. I just didn\u2019t feel like  myself being so thin so I put on about 8-10lbs.  I\u2019m a short 5\u20193 female and currently about 140lbs, 19% body fat and wear a small in most things. More than anything I just want to be healthy and not struggle with health issues as I\u2019m pretty young.  \n\nSo anyway, the thing that really bothers me is she keeps asking me what size uniform I wear.  I wish I was joking, but she asked me what size I wear every time I work.  Every time I tell her my size, she always says \u201c Oh, well, I can\u2019t wear that size, it just doesn\u2019t look good on me\u201d.  I constantly reassure her that she looks beautiful and I really do believe women are beautiful, regardless of their size, and she is not overweight at all. In addition, we are different ages and she has gone through a lot of life things like having kids, where I haven\u2019t so in general, our bodies are just different.  \n\nYesterday she asked me again what size I wore (she has asked multiple times), and I told her that I had put on some weight on my pants maybe were a little bit tighter than normal, but I wear is the same size,  small.  She just stood quiet, and later asked AGAIN what size I wore, at this point I was annoyed- who cares what size I wear! \n\nI asked her if she didn\u2019t believe me or why she kept asking, and she said \u201cI know I should probably loose some weight but I didn\u2019t think it bother you for me to ask you what size you are\u201d.  She seemed really offended and basically shut down. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand why she keeps asking my clothing size everytime we work together, but it\u2019s annoying.  Am I the asshole? I feel like clothing size is very personal and I would never be bold enough to ask what size someone wears.", "created_utc": 1695502822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qf51w/aita_my_friend_wont_stop_asking_me_what_size/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
