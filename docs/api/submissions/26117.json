When my wife asked me today what I thought about the situation I told her that this is our first house and I wouldn't mind her mom living with us but I would want to have the master bedroom for us. She called me selfish and said I was only thinking about myself AITA? I see her point but also since it's our first house together it would feel in a weird way that it's not even our house and we are just living at her moms house again. *Mother in law has her own house but doesn't want to live there anymore MIL (59)", "created_utc": 1693713414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168mte5/aita_for_mil_taking_master_bedroom/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is your first house. You deserve to enjoy it, just you and your wife. Without in-laws moving in and taking over.\n\n4. Wife made decisions for your shared house without asking you and getting your agreement. That's makes her a huge ahole.\n\n5. You give into this and this is how things are gonna be going forward.

Big No to MIL moving in. \n\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: \n\nQuestion: With their current plan, will MIL be paying rent? Will she sign a lease?  I'm not advocating for her moving in, just curious about the level of their entitlement. \n\nAlso, what next? Will the SIL who's been living with her also move in? What about their other siblings? What if they decide they wanna move in too? Will you get a say then?

Maybe a stairlift can be installed. Maybe you have a home office or another room on the ground floor that can be turned into a guest bedroom for the mother. Are you going to be happy for her to be around all the time? I know I wouldn't.

And why should he? \n\nThere is a big problem here that husband is either not admitting to himself or has been blind to before. Certainly the wife has revealed herself now as a manipulator and deceiver.

When she kicked my brother out, anyone who didn't believe her (which was everyone but her father and possibly one friend who has cut her off), were cut off from her life. And my brother moved back in with our parents and I, along with his 2 daughters. The youngest (21) is the only one who has anything to do with her mother and she is more mature than her 43 year old mother.\n\nI suggest couples therapy and if she still doesn't budge, don't start a family with her.

Put in a master bath with an extra door to the hall so it\u2019s a regular bath someday for the kids. BTW does she have a disability because 59 is not even close to too old for stairs. Either way MIL funds a second master or moves upstairs. Also your wife needs to do better, this should never have been a unilateral decision.

She doesn't show the most basic courtesy.", "NTA\n\nWhat about you move your mother in as well and both your mom and your MIL can share the master bedroom.  Bet you MIL and wife don't like that idea.\n\nWhere's the SIL going to live once the MIL's house is sold.", "NTA. MIL moving in and what room she's using g are both things you both have to agree to. Your wife is being ridiculous", "NTA, what I would be pissed at is her making any of these decisions without discussing it with me first.

Totally cool if your okay with that, everyone has their thing.", "Ok so:\n\n1. MIL is only 59(?) why the hell does she need a special room for additional aid? \ud83d\ude02.

Whether you are or not onboard is irrelevant, since you agreed to let your MIL move in knowing she had mobility issues.  My suggestion is to have your mother sell the home she doesn\u2019t want to live in and either 1) Have a mobility stair lift installed so your MIL can live on the 2nd floor game room, or 2) Use the money to have a tiny home built in your backyard for her.", "NTA\n\nJust install one of those chair lift things to wizz her up the stairs.", "MIL can't do stairs.

I have a great relationship with my partners mom, but it would unravel if we lived together.\n\n Imagine you have a fight with your wife. Now, her mom's involved too and it's 2 v 1. Plus, she is living with your wife's sister, where's she going to go? Is she coming too, making it 3 v 1?\n\nNTA but it shouldn't be about which room is hers. It'd be a \"I didn't sign up for roommates\" thing for me. Maybe when she's older and actually needs assistance, but not just because she wants to.", "INFO has MIL promised or given money for this house because that would make a bit of a difference or is it solely you and wife? Is that why she's moving to release money for your wife and her sister to put into property? I'm also just thinking that if games room is adjacent to the bedroom upstairs then if MIL likes to go to bed early or whatever maybe she will be disturbed less with the downstairs bedroom? Could be awkward wanting to use the games room w buddies or whatever with MIL trying to sleep literally next door? The upstairs floor will also be you and your wife's 'domain' as sounds like the MIL won't want to go upstairs too often. Bigger space than just the master bedroom....!", "NTA. You need to talk to your wife NOW. This should have been something she brought up way before now and not your fault for feeling the way you do. If you feel you must assist your MIL, offer to build a MIL suite, install a chair lift, or buy a tiny house and put it outside in backyard where she can still have her own privacy and can easily check on her.", "NTA why wasn\u2019t this discussed before you bought the house ? Then you both could have looked at houses with a Mil suite downstairs or a single story house or ways of making a second master suite upstairs - all of which exist?", "Is MIL disabled? Unable to pay rent at her own place? Will she contribute to expenses? My BIL just moved in with us, but he's permanently disabled. When we get his SSI transferred to a new bank, he'll be contributing to our household expenses. He also would never get the master bedroom. You're not an AH, but your wife is.

Your wife has already made decisions without asking you.", "NTA. \nIt your and your wife\u2019s house. Not MIL\u2019s. Your spouse should have come to you and asked if it was okay to give that bedroom away. \nYour MIL does not come before you. \nWhat your wife did was not okay. \nYou are not selfish to want to stay in the master bedroom.", "I get why you are frustrated, and your wife should definitely have talked to you first, but giving MIL the master bedroom may work out well for you. If she has a single bed, and some furniture in there, like a sofa and a coffee table, plus a tv or desk for a laptop, then she will have her own space. You get the rest of the house.", "NTA you've built a house. Your first home together. Your wife is unilaterally moving her mother in and giving her the master bedroom. The whole thing is BS.", "NTA.  Your SO needs to be reigned in and go to counseling.  Partners don't make decisions like that without communication.\n\nYour MIL does not need to live with you; she may not *want* to live alone.

It should have been discussed either way but if the plan was for MiL to live with you and she can\u2019t do stairs\u2026I\u2019m not seeing another option?

Extra banister? Also trouble with stairs doesn't necessarily mean she SHOULDN'T be doing them, she's only 59. If she stops doing stairs now then there's not much hope for future mobility. If its absolutely impossible then obviously she can't but if its just a bit of extra work for her to climb compared to a normal person then she possibly should be doing them to keep her level of mobility up, harsh as that sounds.

It\u2019s them against him anyway.", "Move out?", "So why can't she stay there?

Is that why you would have to live in the game room vs staying in one of the other bedrooms upstairs?", "It sounds to me like it was designed with MIL in mind you just didn\u2019t know it!

Is she planning to move in with you as well?  If not, then why doesn\u2019t your mil find a more suitable place along with the youngest daughter to live, with the proceeds of selling her home?  Or if you have enough yard space, let her invest in a tiny home to put on your land so that she\u2019s close but has her own space?
