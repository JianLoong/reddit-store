To add to that.. we have three children together. I digress. \n\nThe last few years he has completely forgotten or fallen through on my birthday and Christmas. For example. My last two birthdays I made it expressly known that I would like him to make an effort. To do even the bare minimum to make me feel remotely special. He forgot my birthday. For the past two years. Said NOTHING until I was sobbing because he couldn\u2019t even be half assed to remind our children\u2026 just to say happy birthday. \nWhen I brought it up it is always. \u201cOh, I was going to do something\u2026 \u201c and then crickets. \n\nSame for Christmas. I buy ALL of the Christmas presents. For the kids. For the parents. For the in-laws. FOR HIM. EVERYONE. guess who always has a stocking that is filled\u2026 My kids (obviously) and him. Mine is always empty. He always has multiple gifts under the tree that were thoughtful and time consuming. Meanwhile, I have received approximately two gifts in the past few years. One was a piece of exercise equipment that he wanted for himself disguised as my gift (where I have to pay the monthly subscription) and another was a piece of (admittedly expensive) jewelry that I never wear because it wasn\u2019t remotely what I asked for.  I also want to add that the thought to these gifts were obviously afterthoughts. The exercise equipment didn\u2019t show up for 4-5 months after Christmas because he didn\u2019t order it on time. Meaning he waited until the last damn minute and was like\u2026 guess I\u2019ll do that. The jewelry was in a random cardboard box and he kinda threw it at me the week before Christmas and was like \u201chere is your present\u201d. \n\nSo this year I didn\u2019t get him anything. Not a damn thing. I am spending all of my money to buy the kids\u2019 presents (another thing he doesn\u2019t help with).I\u2019m not spending another dime on gifts for someone who clearly doesn\u2019t appreciate or respect me. \n\nSo.

Who knows, maybe this is the reality check he needs to change his tune. I hope so for your sake.", "NTA. Why gift him when he doesn\u2019t gift you? Spend your money on the kids. You seem a little salty about the fact that he has made no tangible steps towards marrying you but given your relationship dynamic you\u2019ll probably be the one paying for the wedding so it\u2019s just as well.", "NTA.

There's a wonderful gift you could give yourself this Christmas - freedom.", "NTA\nand quite frankly, if you can afford it...leave him. \n\nTook 8 years to get mine to propose, and this is after I left him. He got his shit together. Now, I'm not gonna be an 8 year fiance either, so no marriage I'm done. \nWe have a kid together too.\n\nFirst 3 years he didn't get me anything even though I said a hand written note is good enough.

Forgeting you even just once or twice a year on special occasions is not a great indication of how much he values you.", "I do want to also add another side note.

Something else is going on and until that's resolved you're going to be unhappy. I hate to see a home break, but many times it's already broken before the parents even split.", "Honest answer? NTA for not getting him anything, but it sounds like continuing to stay in this \"engagement\" (be honest, it was a tactic to get you to stick around), then you would be one... Your kid's deserve to know how they should be treated and how they should great their partner someday, and you deserve so much more. My husband isn't great at getting things early, but he does come through every time. The one year I thought he may have well and truly  forgotten (it was crickets leading up to the day) he surprised me in the grocery store with my best friend from overseas. \n\nSo NTA, but consider losing the dead weight.", "NTA, but you\u2019ve only got the one life.

It's one thing to agree on not exchanging (expendive) gifts among adults, especially when money is tight, but he can't even say happy birthday or remind the kids? That's just sad. You can forget some things, sure, but thats what calendars and notifications are for and in general it doesn't seem like he cares at all.\nI N F O: Does he at least do chores or pay half of all bills? Would you generally decribe your relationship as good and he is just ridiculously unorganized and not all that mindful?", "I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t even begin to understand why you\u2019re watching your life evaporate in the presence of someone who sounds like they don\u2019t even like you, much less *love* you. \n\nObviously NTA for refusing to spend money on someone who habitually ignores you, and hasn\u2019t progressed past age 12 in terms of mental and emotional maturity. But, look, this will ONLY get worse. People don\u2019t change: they just become more and more who they already are. This would be different if he were someone who was just innocently absentminded, and was showing sincere effort to overcome it. But he regularly sees you dissolve into tears because of his apathy towards you, and he\u2019s like \u201cwhatev.\u201d That is NOT the behavior of someone who is going to change, or even wants to change. \n\nSilver lining: since he *didn\u2019t* marry you, your finances aren\u2019t legally entangled. 1.) stop making more kids for him, 2.) begin researching your options to leave, 3.) talk to an attorney to make sure your ducks are in a row re: child support, etc. \n\nLeaving won\u2019t be easy, but staying sounds like torture.", "NTA\n\nYou've given him 8 years... what makes you think another two will make any difference.  Nothing has changed so far and it's only going to get worse.  You will just waste these next two years when you could be living a better life.\n\nDepending on what country you live in you may be entitled to a lot more than he realises even if you aren't married because you have 3 kids together.\n\nI would consult a family lawyer and find out what you are actually entitled to because he won't tell you the truth.", "INFO: Is the example of love you're proud of modelling for your kids? Your kids will initially date people who treat them how your fianc\u00e9 treats you because this is the dynamic you're normalising for them.
