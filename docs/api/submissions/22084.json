Since then he day trades and says he wants to find what he really wants to do but he hasn\u2019t figured it out yet. To me it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s doing much to figure out his next move and it\u2019s giving me a lot of anxiety to support our family and expenses (two kids under 4) by myself (mortgage, childcare, etc). I will chime in with ideas to help him figure out what he wants to do next with job postings, suggesting he talk to a career coach, network etc but he will either get annoyed or say he\u2019ll do it but never does. He also says he doesn\u2019t want to go back into tech even though that\u2019s his entire work experience. He refuses to give a timeline of when he\u2019ll make a decision on what he wants to do with his life.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think he will never get another  job because he doesn\u2019t really want to go back to work in corporate.

Day trading is incredibly risky, especially when done by someone with no background in finance and an apparently terrible work ethic.\n\nWas he a golden child who got spoiled by his parents? He's acting like a child, not a partner.\n\nIf he wants to day trade, he should start by getting a paying job and then negotiating with you regarding what (25% or less, to start) percentage of his take-home pay he is allowed to invest in his day trading side gig. If he ever generates enough income from that to replace his paycheck, then he can quit. But he can't avoid working now in hopes of someday figuring out how to invest well.\n\nIMO, ultimatums never work. So don't give him the choice of getting a job or getting divorced. Just tell him he needs to move out and to let you know what address you should use to mail divorce paperwork to him. Maybe that will be enough of a wake up call to get him to start acting like an adult again, but that seems very unlikely.", "Even if you got a raise and suddenly was making more money, the resentment you feel will not go away.

That might be something that you might want to try to address.\n\nBy the way, 80-99% of day traders fail. It's a cutthroat field where the best of the best eat rookies alive. Everyone who gets into day trading thinks that they're unique, but 9.99 times out of 10 they lose their money.\n\nSince it's very easy to lose a lot of money day trading, you need to get good insight into the household finances. Make sure that your husband isn't wasting money.\n\nBest of luck to you all.", "NTA, get a divorce, your kids are young and will respect you more if you got a divorce than grow up watching you hate their father as he spirals down this path \n\nDamn be the shame you think you\u2019ll feel, you\u2019ll feel more shame with your life knowing you stayed with this deadbeat longer than you needed to, supporting him and being a mother to your children AND your husband", "INFO\n\nDid you voice your concerns to him as clearly you expressed them here, in one go?\n\nDid you consider couple therapy?", "NTA.\nI will say, if he's actually GOOD at day trading and is making a sustainable income off it, then there shouldn't be a problem, but it IS risky. I've seen people take out credit to start day trading and end up 50k in debt. Divorce may be disgraceful culturally speaking but logically speaking, if the choice is between separating and tanking your whole family's financial well being, cultural norms be damned.\nInvesting to try to create some passive income IS a worthwhile endeavor, but a person has to be smart about it and only invest money they won't miss if it fails. I hope you all can work through it and find a way that doesn't break up a family that's just having some rough moments, but if it becomes a downward spiral, you owe it to yourself and your kids to take care of the rest of your family if the hubs' midlife crisis drags you all down with him.

Day trading is very risky even for experts and he could lose thousands on one bad trade. If he wants to change careers fine but give him a hard deadline to start taking care of his family or you will leave. Deadbeat dads are far worse than any cultural stigma of divorce, and of course in the US there is no such stigma at all.", "NTA. You can end a relationship for any reason at any time and this is certainly a good one if an ultimatum/therapy won't work", "NTA. I think he's playing video games, not day trading. You got married and had kids. Now you have a lazy deadbeat dragging you down. Get a divorce & best wishes to you.", "NTA.\n\nYou are both supposed to be a team and he is playing solitaire.\n\nI think you can give him a timeline to when you are going to call it quits so that he realizes what's at stake in his current decision making.\n\nIt sounds like you can be quite clear with him about your goals:\n\nShort term: financial risk taking needs to be a joint decision. That the risks of day trading are contained. Be clear that you need X% of the portfolio to be in stable/lower risk positions and that you should have $x in cash reserves in very low risk investments like government bonds. Ask him to explain to you his investment strategy, results over the past few months, etc. Sounds like you need better insight and communication from him on this front.\n\nMedium term: he needs to be clear and clearly taking action towards his career shift. Give him the option of being primarily a stay at home dad with some investing on the side (as well as taking on the vast majority of housework and child care so you can commit to ladder climbing) or getting a new career. There are so many ways of having a tech career that links to other work. Ask and really listen to what his goals and vision is. Try to help him see how that fits with yours. Is there a middle ground you can find where you are both happy?\n\nAsk him to identify what the specific things are that he can commit to to demonstrate he's not just saying 'sure'. Needs to be a yes or a no with clear indicators that he's making progress.\n\nHope this helps. Finances are always a big potential stressor in a marriage and hopefully all he needs is the wake-up call that you are ready to pull the parachute. He might not believe that's a possible outcome because of the cultural component. \n\nAnother question I have based on your post is whether he might be clinically depressed based. Hopefully he can work that through.", "Nta. Your hubby is risking yours and the kids future because he doesn't want to work and is fully content having you support his gambling.(because with no education or experience in the financial market that's essentially what daytrading is). He isn't working towards a goal. He's avoiding his responsibilities and placing an unfair burden on you. There's zero legitimate reason for him not to work at the job he is trained and experienced in to bring in the money while he prepares/looks for a \"better\" job. That's what responsible adults with families to support do. Also...he's not working yet you still have to pay childcare expenses? So he isn't pulling his financial or supporting the family in other ways either? Is he at least doing a larger share of the household and cooking duties?\nYou need to protect yourself and your assets, you want to make sure he isn't able to deplete savings take out a second mortgage or run up creditbills that you will be stuck with for decades.", "NTA. He can't reasonably expect you to shoulder the burden while he hobby day trades and tries to figure himself out. Sometimes as parents, we need to do things we might not want to, all to benefit our nuclear family. This is his time to step up.\n\nYou need to let him know how discontent you are. It will hopefully be a wake-up call for him.If not, try to set some parameters on him getting some kind of employment--timeline, earnings, type of job. He's letting you be stressed and not coming to meet you partway at all.\n\nInertia is tough to get beyond, and there may be other factors involved. But for all that, you ans your children deserve a husband/father who is a completely present member of the family, If he is willfully ignoring the stresses on you, there's no incentive for him to pound the pavement for work.", "NTA I would give him a fair chance on day trading since it really seems like it's his new passion. Ask him for a timeline on when he expects to make money from trading (negotiate a reasonable one) and say he has to go back to job hunting once it's over. Also, monitor if he's actually making money from it. If he doesn't follow through you in any of these you have my full support in divorcing him. This can't drag on forever and he has to carry his own weight.", "NTA   \n\nThat sort of resentment brews, and it will get worse over time. Don\u2019t ever feel guilty for knowing what you need. Therapy may be a good next step, if you think things can be saved. You\u2019re allowed to daydream about wanting things to be better.

Day trading will lose you money over the long-term. Those who do that successfully, have a ton of research provided by their companies, just a Bloomberg terminal, being intelligent and good education is not enough, at least for the majority. It's so fucking volatile and an enormous downswing is inevitable. This is were things get real, by chasing losses. It's incredibly exhausting and challenging to keep a cool head. Maybe your husband is cut out for it, I don't know. Personally I would be pretty stressed having a partner who does this. Because even if it's running good for some time, it's hard not to overestimate one self, which is also pretty dangerous.

As such a marriage counselor should be consulted and this can tell you more about the danger your husband poses to your family\u2019s finances. Will he commit to finding a solution to the family over his desire to win big? Will he accept an allotted portion of money to gamble with in day trading, from which his profits can then be used to increase his gambling amounts? Is he willing to see that risky financial choices can harm the children? In the end, where is his biggest commitment? \u2026 to his desire for risk, or towards the health and contentment of his wife and children?

They pick up on tension, depression, anger and all the negative things happening between parents. What they need is a drama-free home, not the validation of some random people who will always find ways to shame their mom anyways. \n\nYou owe it to your kids to have a functional marriage with everybody doing their part. If that's not happening, you need to get a divorce. Set an example for your kids too that it's okay to walk out of toxic, unviable situations no matter what the \"culture\" says. \n\nI'm south Asian too, I understand.\n\nNTA.", "Does he sound like the kind of person who respect such a limit?

My parents divorced 13 years ago as my father refused to get a job after the engineering company he worked for downsized. He ran up $15k+ in 6 months (in addition to the massive debt he had previously hidden). My parents filed for bankruptcy, lost the houses, etc. Thankfully my siblings and I were adults. My mother stood by him for over a year (he was cheating too. And yes, depressed. I understand depression more than I can ever express as I\u2019ve been hospitalized for it). We were born and raised into a strict right-wing Christian religion. Divorce was not an option. She did separate from him and moved in with me. My mother was finally approved for divorced by the religion, when debt collectors solicited members of the church \ud83d\ude44.\n\nMoral of the story: culture/religion plays a MASSIVE part in life sometimes. However, if your partner\u2019s actions adversely affect your life, and your children\u2019s lives, and said partner refuses to step up, separation and/or divorce is more than ok.\n\nYou sound like an amazing and strong woman, and mother.

Rule #1, only invest money you can lose. Sounds like he doesn't even get rule #1. Could he Strike lucky? Sure, but most day traders fail and sometimes horribly. You don't want to stay around for the horribly. \n\nI get your culture, and this will sound hard, but you're in America now.
