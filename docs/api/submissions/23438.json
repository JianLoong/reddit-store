Since I\u2019ve turned 18, she told me that I would have to start contributing to her rent and bills if I wanted to continue living with her. I told her that if she wanted me to pay any bills in the house, then I would no longer watch her two children (four and two) for free anymore and she would have to pay me for the childcare. She works a 9 to 5 Monday through Friday and while she\u2019s gone I watch her kids for her. I am in University and take classes online so it\u2019s easy to multitask plus her four year old is in preschool half day and Im the one that picks her up and drops her off.  \n\n\nBecause of my contributions, I expect to be treated like a roommate in her apartment. I may not pay any rent, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not contributing to the household in terms of childcare. She cannot afford daycare, the ones in our area charge around 2000 for two children every month she doesn\u2019t even pay that in rent. She still chastises me on certain things like not paying for food or my phone bill.  \n\n\nI also can barely have a social life or even a weekend job because I\u2019m always expected to watch her her kids so I can live with her rent free and she often uses that to her own advantage and during weekends doesn\u2019t come home at all.   \n\n\nI\u2019m sick of it and was ranting to a friend from school about it and she told me that one of her roommates was moving out at the end of this month to go back to her homestate after a horrible family tragedy happened, and this roommate in particular had paid rent upfront for the entire lease that doesn\u2019t end until October so she would be cool with having me in that room for free until the lease ends and so I can get back on my feet and land a job that I can pay the rent for the nee one. I couldn\u2019t pass up on this offer that I knew I would never get again so I made the choice to move out.  \n\n\nI waited to tell my sister since it\u2019s her birthday weekend at the end of July and I knew she had plans and wasn\u2019t planning to come home and I was gonna watch her kids as a final goodbye. She came back from her trip yesterday and I finally sat down and told her that I was moving out in the beginning of August. She started crying asking how I could do do this to her, knowing that she can\u2019t afford childcare and doesn\u2019t qualify for assistance and that she will have to come up with another form of child care, and might have to drive an hour to take her kids to our grandparents so they can watch them and that would be a huge inconvenience to her and then she doesn\u2019t know if she can handle both the financial responsibilities of rent and daycare and she will probably have to move out and I\u2019m basically ruining her life.

Since your sister wanted to start charging you rent as opposed to accepting child care as payment, she should have already been looking for alternative childcare.

It will never be a good time for you to move out as long as your sister can not afford childcare.

It sounds as if these 3 months will be a good opportunity for both of you to get a better perspective on the advantages that you have each experienced with your current arrangement. May you both learn and grow from it and, eventually, mend your relationship.", "NTA- Maybe now she will see how good she had it while you were living there. Give her a month and she will be offering you free rent again. No more party weekends for her. In a way it's like the saying......Don't bite the hand that feeds you.  She had free childcare. The joke is on her.", "NTA. With your experience you could become a live in nanny. You've been an unpaid live in nanny for years now. In my area, you'd be getting at least $3000 a month and not pay rent or utilities for what you've been doing!", "NTA. You are her childcare so it\u2019s fair to not pay rent when it\u2019s saving her a lot of money overall when that\u2019s been what was going on.

I am glad you are out of there and finally get to live your own life.", "ESH Your sister is awful. No question. But moving out without giving her time to figure something else out? Also awful. Sounds like you\u2019ve been living with her kids their entire lives. How are they going to do without you?\n\nAlso, be really, really sure of the deal you\u2019re walking into. You\u2019ve never had a job or supported yourself. By October, you\u2019ll need to have saved up first & last month\u2019s rent, plus security deposit for another place. Make sure the tragedy roommate isn\u2019t going to try to sublease to anyone else. Just make sure you are going to have a place to live and a way to support yourself when the freebie is up. \n\nI predict that this will completely end your relationship with your sister- if not forever then for a long, long time. Be prepared for that as well.", "NTA and if sister can't afford her life, she needs to adapt. Maybe she can move closer to your grandparents. Maybe she can get a roommate who will pay rent. None of her complications are your responsibility. Good luck!", "ESH. Your sister clearly takes advantage of you but 1 week notice sucks of you.\nI will say however that you made the right decision. You cannot be held responsible for your sister's issues.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nShe views you as a free solution in child care and you've been taking advantage of her letting you live there rent free and then decided to leave her in the lurch. Everyone's an AH here.", "NTA but I would give her at least 2-4 weeks notice.", "It sounds like your sister is suffering from double think. It\u2019s kind of like people complaining about Mexicans \u2013 they are so lazy, and simultaneously stealing everyone\u2019s job! Which is it?\n  You were supposedly taking advantage of your sister because you\u2019re living in her house, rent free. But simultaneously, she can\u2019t afford to lose you because she can\u2019t afford to pay anyone for childcare. Who is taking advantage of whom here? On the one hand she wants to guilt you about not paying rent, and on the other, you are providing a valuable, irreplaceable service to her. She is happy to guilt you, and frame you as a user, but when you say \u201cOK, I won\u2019t use you anymore\u201d, she says, how dare you leave! I need you! You are definitely NTA, and it sounds like your sister needs a reality check.", "ESH\nShe relied on your help and did not try to find another longterm solution.\nBut you are her sister and you live with her since you are 16. Your sister deserves more than such a short notice to change her live.", "ESH. You should be contributing financially, but you\u2019re also free to go and find a place of your own. Housing isn\u2019t cheap. Your sister chose to \nhave kids. She also took responsibility of you when she could have just sent you to foster care, which in hindsight would have probably been the better financial deal for her to raise her own children. But she didn\u2019t.", "I'm going against the grain and saying NAH. You are absolutely not an a-hole for wanting to have a life. The current situation was not sustainable long-term, and I'm sure your sister knew that deep down, but she was living in denial. Move out and spread your wings and fly - that's what you're supposed to do. But I also don't think your sister is the a-hole simply for wanting to keep the status quo and for her initial reaction. She's allowed to be sad and scared, since daycare is crazy expensive, but it isn't fair for her to take it out on you. Hopefully she calms down and apologizes. (If she doesn't calm down, and continues to try to guilt you, then I'll change my verdict to N...T...A...)", "YTA. I assume since you started living there at sixteen, she was your foster placement meaning that she took you in when she didn\u2019t have to and gavr you a better life than going to the system. \n\nOnce you turn 18, you\u2019re expected to contribute in one way or another. In this case it seems like you\u2019re contributing child care which is fair but I don\u2019t see how the issue with your sister using it even on her time off considering you still live there during her time off. During the weekends when she\u2019s gone, you\u2019re still living in her apartment rent free. And also it\u2019s not like youre watching her kids 24 seven and she comes home and watches them so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re working all the time BUT you live there all the time.

I'm just wondering how she has enough money to be gone for entire weekends and go away for a whole weekend on a birthday trip. If she acknowledges that daycare for her children would be $2,000 per month and your contribution in lieu of rent is childcare, then your contribution to rent is $2,000.

More or less than 2 weeks?", "NTA. Nannies get free board, get paid and get time off. You aren't obligated to be her free childcare forever. Disappearing for entire weekends is wild!
