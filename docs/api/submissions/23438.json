Im 20 and live with my 28 year old sister. Ive been living with her since I was 16. Since I\u2019ve turned 18, she told me that I would have to start contributing to her rent and bills if I wanted to continue living with her. I told her that if she wanted me to pay any bills in the house, then I would no longer watch her two children (four and two) for free anymore and she would have to pay me for the childcare. She works a 9 to 5 Monday through Friday and while she\u2019s gone I watch her kids for her. I am in University and take classes online so it\u2019s easy to multitask plus her four year old is in preschool half day and Im the one that picks her up and drops her off.  \n\n\nBecause of my contributions, I expect to be treated like a roommate in her apartment. I may not pay any rent, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not contributing to the household in terms of childcare. She cannot afford daycare, the ones in our area charge around 2000 for two children every month she doesn\u2019t even pay that in rent. She still chastises me on certain things like not paying for food or my phone bill.  \n\n\nI also can barely have a social life or even a weekend job because I\u2019m always expected to watch her her kids so I can live with her rent free and she often uses that to her own advantage and during weekends doesn\u2019t come home at all.   \n\n\nI\u2019m sick of it and was ranting to a friend from school about it and she told me that one of her roommates was moving out at the end of this month to go back to her homestate after a horrible family tragedy happened, and this roommate in particular had paid rent upfront for the entire lease that doesn\u2019t end until October so she would be cool with having me in that room for free until the lease ends and so I can get back on my feet and land a job that I can pay the rent for the nee one. I couldn\u2019t pass up on this offer that I knew I would never get again so I made the choice to move out.  \n\n\nI waited to tell my sister since it\u2019s her birthday weekend at the end of July and I knew she had plans and wasn\u2019t planning to come home and I was gonna watch her kids as a final goodbye. She came back from her trip yesterday and I finally sat down and told her that I was moving out in the beginning of August. She started crying asking how I could do do this to her, knowing that she can\u2019t afford childcare and doesn\u2019t qualify for assistance and that she will have to come up with another form of child care, and might have to drive an hour to take her kids to our grandparents so they can watch them and that would be a huge inconvenience to her and then she doesn\u2019t know if she can handle both the financial responsibilities of rent and daycare and she will probably have to move out and I\u2019m basically ruining her life. That she let me live with her rent free in that I\u2019m just now leaving her and her kids high and dry and I\u2019m a huge asshole.", "created_utc": 1690662370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d1z5y/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_sisters_apartment_after/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does she think you\u2019re supposed to be her live in servant for life?", "NTA, you were watching her kids full time, which she knows how much that is - that's certainly not rent-free. How does she expect you to earn money to pay rent if you're already going to college and doing 40 hours of child care? That doesn't even make sense. She will figure it - it sounds like it's time for you to move on, being her 40+ hours a week babysitter doesn't sound like much of a life.", "Okay so your supposed to be her live in nanny 24/7, unpaid but somehow find a way to pay her bills \ud83e\udd14", "NTA. Since your sister wanted to start charging you rent as opposed to accepting child care as payment, she should have already been looking for alternative childcare. If she was expecting you to start paying rent while still providing a service worth more than 2K per month (more than her total rent, ffs), then that\u2019s just tough.\n\nSis is in for a rude awakening, and it sounds like she needs it. Meanwhile, you deserve to have a chance to live your life, work to pay your own bills, and finally enjoy having actual free time on your days off from work like anyone else, including your sister.", "NTA - \n\nYou were not living there for free, you were paying with services.\n\nShe will have to drive the kids.  Boohoo. \n\nAs to the people complaining about your not giving notice, notice is not the issue, the sister does not have the money.", "NTA It's short notice, however, this day was coming, if not now, when? It will never be a good time for you to move out as long as your sister can not afford childcare. It always going to be an issue because both of your sister's children will need to childcare during school breaks when they start school. Did she honestly believe you were going to live with her for another three years to provide child care?", "NTA, assuming that you are planning to get a job and pay rent somewhere at the end of the rent-free period.  It sounds as if these 3 months will be a good opportunity for both of you to get a better perspective on the advantages that you have each experienced with your current arrangement. May you both learn and grow from it and, eventually, mend your relationship.", "NTA- Maybe now she will see how good she had it while you were living there. Give her a month and she will be offering you free rent again. No more party weekends for her. In a way it's like the saying......Don't bite the hand that feeds you.  She had free childcare. The joke is on her.", "NTA. With your experience you could become a live in nanny. You've been an unpaid live in nanny for years now. In my area, you'd be getting at least $3000 a month and not pay rent or utilities for what you've been doing!", "NTA. You are her childcare so it\u2019s fair to not pay rent when it\u2019s saving her a lot of money overall when that\u2019s been what was going on. You also aren\u2019t an asshole for moving out and living somewhere else. \n\nDoes suck she was given a week notice to find childcare and to figure it out though.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMove out, stop babysitting and get anopther job instead.", "But you were paying rent: in the form of childcare. That's roughly two thousand a month, which is a lot of rent to pay.\n\nYour sister had a deal others would die for, but as with the goose that laid the golden egg, she went and wrecked it out of greed.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Did she really think you would live with her forever and be her childcare? You're right that you can't afford to turn down an opportunity to get on your feet.", "NTA\n\nYou paid your way (childcare) and she took advantage. She should have been PAYING you on top of letting you live there free! All the bills wouldn\u2019t be 2k a month unless you live in a super HCOL area. She should\u2019ve stop treating you like a second parent to the children, but a child to her. That\u2019s a fucked situation. She should\u2019ve seen this coming!\n\nGood luck OP!", "\\*\\*\\*NTA\\*\\*\\*Sister was living what is called \"hot girl summer\". Basically means young, happy, child free, can do whatever she wants. She had her younger sister in the house as free 24/7 childcare which was BS since the younger sister does NOT have any kids. Watching her kids during the week is one thing but disappearing all weekend is a bunch of crap. She got greedy and wanted to hot girl summer with extra money. She messed around and found out. Now hot girl summer is not only OVER, but she's going to have to scramble to find childcare, which doesn't make sense. If she is demanding that younger sister find a job, she SHOULD'VE already found childcare and been ready for them to start.", "Your sister is a parent.  You are not.  She is the one who decided to gave two children as a single person.  She is treating you like their parent.  She has to figure it out.", "NTA. Where does she propose this mystical \u201crent money\u201d come from while you work unpaid 40+hours a week providing her childcare while also going to school? Does it suck you left her with short notice? Sure. Not sure you had better options though.", "Haaaa. She *lets* you live rent free while complaining at you constantly and you are raising her kids. Laugh at her and move out. NTA.", "INFO: Did you ever try to talk to her directly about the weekend childcare issue?", "NTA. You paid your way by babysitting. $2000 worth per month. She was taking advantage of you and now needs to figure it out.\n\nMove in with your friend.", "NTA", "NTA - her kids are not your responsibility. She definitely saved a lot by having you help out with her kids, and she should have been grateful for that. She should have also known that there would come a day where you would grow up and want to live on your own. She shouldn't make you feel guilty about leaving and be more proud that you're responsible enough to make it on your own. I hope everything works out between you two!!", "INFO: Where is/are the father(s)??? Why aren\u2019t *they* helping raise the children they created??\n\nEveryone, (most everyone), here is correct, NTA!!", "NTA. I hope she wasn\u2019t expecting you to live with her forever especially after telling you to pay rent and take care of her kids.", "NTA. Knowing how hard it is to find good childcare I would definitely STFU if I was her.", "Nta. She wasn\u2019t paying for childcare she had time to save money. Besides she didn\u2019t think she was going to be able to hold you hostage forever right? In her world it would have never been a good time for you to move out. She will figure something out. I am glad you are out of there and finally get to live your own life.", "ESH Your sister is awful. No question. But moving out without giving her time to figure something else out? Also awful. Sounds like you\u2019ve been living with her kids their entire lives. How are they going to do without you?\n\nAlso, be really, really sure of the deal you\u2019re walking into. You\u2019ve never had a job or supported yourself. By October, you\u2019ll need to have saved up first & last month\u2019s rent, plus security deposit for another place. Make sure the tragedy roommate isn\u2019t going to try to sublease to anyone else. Just make sure you are going to have a place to live and a way to support yourself when the freebie is up. \n\nI predict that this will completely end your relationship with your sister- if not forever then for a long, long time. Be prepared for that as well.", "NTA and if sister can't afford her life, she needs to adapt. Maybe she can move closer to your grandparents. Maybe she can get a roommate who will pay rent. None of her complications are your responsibility. Good luck!", "ESH. Your sister clearly takes advantage of you but 1 week notice sucks of you.\nI will say however that you made the right decision. You cannot be held responsible for your sister's issues.", "ESH. Your sister doesn't just have to think about the rent but also all the other bills as well, I can relate to being the only adult responsible for keeping a roof over another adults head with them seemingly contributing little in comparison, if she loses the apartment or falls behind on bills her kids will be affected the most.\n\nShe sucks for expecting you to always babysit her kids just because you live there because you're allowed a life too. \n\nReading between the lines you've both been there for eachother in a time of need (her taking you in at 16 and you babysitting) so hopefully you work it out even if you don't move back in!", "ESH\n\nShe views you as a free solution in child care and you've been taking advantage of her letting you live there rent free and then decided to leave her in the lurch. Everyone's an AH here.", "NTA but I would give her at least 2-4 weeks notice.", "It sounds like your sister is suffering from double think. It\u2019s kind of like people complaining about Mexicans \u2013 they are so lazy, and simultaneously stealing everyone\u2019s job! Which is it?\n  You were supposedly taking advantage of your sister because you\u2019re living in her house, rent free. But simultaneously, she can\u2019t afford to lose you because she can\u2019t afford to pay anyone for childcare. Who is taking advantage of whom here? On the one hand she wants to guilt you about not paying rent, and on the other, you are providing a valuable, irreplaceable service to her. She is happy to guilt you, and frame you as a user, but when you say \u201cOK, I won\u2019t use you anymore\u201d, she says, how dare you leave! I need you! You are definitely NTA, and it sounds like your sister needs a reality check.", "ESH\nShe relied on your help and did not try to find another longterm solution.\nBut you are her sister and you live with her since you are 16. Your sister deserves more than such a short notice to change her live.", "ESH. You should be contributing financially, but you\u2019re also free to go and find a place of your own. Housing isn\u2019t cheap. Your sister chose to \nhave kids. She also took responsibility of you when she could have just sent you to foster care, which in hindsight would have probably been the better financial deal for her to raise her own children. But she didn\u2019t.", "I'm going against the grain and saying NAH. You are absolutely not an a-hole for wanting to have a life. The current situation was not sustainable long-term, and I'm sure your sister knew that deep down, but she was living in denial. Move out and spread your wings and fly - that's what you're supposed to do. But I also don't think your sister is the a-hole simply for wanting to keep the status quo and for her initial reaction. She's allowed to be sad and scared, since daycare is crazy expensive, but it isn't fair for her to take it out on you. Hopefully she calms down and apologizes. (If she doesn't calm down, and continues to try to guilt you, then I'll change my verdict to N...T...A...)", "YTA. I assume since you started living there at sixteen, she was your foster placement meaning that she took you in when she didn\u2019t have to and gavr you a better life than going to the system. \n\nOnce you turn 18, you\u2019re expected to contribute in one way or another. In this case it seems like you\u2019re contributing child care which is fair but I don\u2019t see how the issue with your sister using it even on her time off considering you still live there during her time off. During the weekends when she\u2019s gone, you\u2019re still living in her apartment rent free. And also it\u2019s not like youre watching her kids 24 seven and she comes home and watches them so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re working all the time BUT you live there all the time. You could have given her a warning earlier.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
