Today I was there for the encounter and gave the woman a very hard time about it.  \n\nBackstory.  My wife and I are happily married with 3 kids (8, 5, & 2).  We struggled with fertility early on but have been blessed in having 3 awesome kids.  My wife is not obese or fat by any means.  She carrys some extra skin/weight in her stomach area following giving birth to 3 full term kids.  This is no issue in our relationship and she even sees a doctor regularly.  None of us has commented a need to lose weight.  \n\nThis year we\u2019ve had three encounters with total strangers asking her about being pregnant.  One involved a man asking if she was pregnant when she got on an amusement park ride.  One was a random woman at a department store asking her the same.  All situations 2-3 of my children were present.  Both I was not present for.  Both very much upset my wife (understandably) and I was left to pick up the pieces.  \n\nToday I was there with all three of my kids when a stranger striking polite conversation asked her if \u201canother was on the way\u201d. I had it.  I asked her wtf was wrong with her and how she would like it if some total stranger asked her if she was pregnant.  I also told her that no normal person would ever bring that question in to casual conversation.  She apologized before we walked out separate ways.  \n\nAm I the asshole for this?  Do people normally bring this up as casual conversation?  I understand the ride operator at the amusement park (I guess) but feel everyone else was out of line.

You are running a much higher risk of offending someone or making them uncomfortable than there are possible benefits to that question.\n\nThere are people struggling with fertility, there are people in the early stages of pregnancy who are still uncomfortable talking about it, and there are simply not pregnant, all of which can be potentially hurt or much more hurt by the comment.
