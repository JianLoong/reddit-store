Today I was there for the encounter and gave the woman a very hard time about it.  \n\nBackstory.  My wife and I are happily married with 3 kids (8, 5, & 2).  We struggled with fertility early on but have been blessed in having 3 awesome kids.  My wife is not obese or fat by any means.  She carrys some extra skin/weight in her stomach area following giving birth to 3 full term kids.  This is no issue in our relationship and she even sees a doctor regularly.  None of us has commented a need to lose weight.  \n\nThis year we\u2019ve had three encounters with total strangers asking her about being pregnant.  One involved a man asking if she was pregnant when she got on an amusement park ride.  One was a random woman at a department store asking her the same.  All situations 2-3 of my children were present.  Both I was not present for.  Both very much upset my wife (understandably) and I was left to pick up the pieces.  \n\nToday I was there with all three of my kids when a stranger striking polite conversation asked her if \u201canother was on the way\u201d. I had it.  I asked her wtf was wrong with her and how she would like it if some total stranger asked her if she was pregnant.  I also told her that no normal person would ever bring that question in to casual conversation.  She apologized before we walked out separate ways.  \n\nAm I the asshole for this?  Do people normally bring this up as casual conversation?  I understand the ride operator at the amusement park (I guess) but feel everyone else was out of line.  I would never ask any woman, even those I know who are pregnant, about their pregnancies, ever.", "created_utc": 1691441617, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kwqt5/aita_for_yelling_at_the_woman_who_asked_my_wife/", "score": 241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are running a much higher risk of offending someone or making them uncomfortable than there are possible benefits to that question.\n\nThere are people struggling with fertility, there are people in the early stages of pregnancy who are still uncomfortable talking about it, and there are simply not pregnant, all of which can be potentially hurt or much more hurt by the comment.

Also I've seen this in TV as a joke and it's also probably where your wife got the insecurity and connection but pregnant women don't look fat  because only 1 part of the body grows majorly there can be bloating of other body parts but as a whole they are not going to look that different from their normal everyday look except for the 1 area.", "Bruhhh I'm going straight up with you...respectfully your wife looks pregnant here's my thing if it was just one incident I would say yeah that guy was just an AH but you've had 3 in the same year.

I understand your saying you have accepted some things about your wife and her wight or extra skin whatever that's fine but no one else knows that and apparently at least a little but your wife looks pregnant yall can be upset about that or change it but you can't control what people think and say. I know it's hard to to shield your wife from discomfort but I would gage how she feels about it and help her get to a place where it doesn't bother her. Whether that's because she looses the weight or she accepts that some people may think that. I think you can only focus on what you can do and if people say things you consider to be rude maybe think about the context did these people mean to insult your wife or were they trying to be kind that should dictat your response it's often not the words that are the problem it's the emotions they invoke.", "NTA", "In my opinion- YTA for yelling at this person, but NTA for loving and sticking up for your wife...", "Honestly really there is no reason for this kind of personal question.

There are many different possibilities for a persons stomach to apear that way. OP already explained in the post why his wifes stomach looks that way. No need to be rude and qustion it. Also due to there being multiple reasons for a person to look like that people shouldn't assume and ask they should just mind their business and if someone wants to talk about a pregnancy they can. Also pregnancy may not always be a good thing people want to talk about with strangers. There have been some women who have conditions during their pregnancy that can be life threatening or the baby is a high risk for not surviving and when strangers ask them all happy about their pregnancy it can be triggering and hard to talk about to a someone they never met.
