I have a strong overall disdain for organized religion, and believe the world would be better off without it. So I told her that I absolutely would not want to get married in a church. I don't want one of the most important moments of my life to be intertwined with religion. I made it clear this wasn't something I wanted to compromise on.\n\nShe was upset when I told her that, reiterating how important it is for her and her grandpa. I told her it isn't his wedding, but ours, and she told me that it's supposed to be between two families coming together, and that I'm being selfish by not considering her family too.

For example, pre-marital counseling (which is not a bad thing), but also that you swear you will raise your children Catholic and other items like that.  I wanted to get married in a church but if my husband had wanted me to do a Catholic wedding, I'm not sure I would have wanted to.  \n\nIt may be about blending families, but this sounds more like it's her way or not.

That is concerning to me. Marriage is the coming together of two PEOPLE. Not all their families opinions and baggage.", "NTA\n\nBeing selfish goes both ways and IMO her wanting to marry in a church because it's what her grandfather wants is a weaker reason than not getting married because of your own (non) beliefs.", "NTA.

I don't think hard limits are selfish, they are just something you have to workout as a couple. \n\nMy understanding is that you can't just show up at a Catholic church to get married, you are supposed to be Catholic. So you probably need to look into that before agreeing. Your fiancee might still count if she was raised Catholic, while you are possible not baptised and not confirmed.\n\nAlso, what other religious ceremonies does she think need to be done?

But if you're both atheists the meaning behind a church wedding is null.\n\nAlso, my sister married a protestant and the church didn't even let them do a full mass, because her husband was not Catholic, so even if you agreed to get married in the church, I don't think the church would allow that.", "No, this isn\u2019t about two FAMILIES coming together.

One red flag though, she is suddenly wanting the Catholic way and church bc it means so much to her??

Or take your kids to Catholic mass without you?? That is even more concerning, imo. Totally becoming not who you thought she was and completely changing y'alls entire relationship. Next thing you know, you'll have advent candles, Wednesday Ashes for  Ash Wednesday, no meat on Fridays during lent,... all the Catholic traditions. Catholic faith is very traditional. I suggest talking at length about all of this before going any further with wedding planning. A marriage isn't about having a \"perfect day\" for the bride as \"she always dreamed\".

There's meetings with the priest about your faith and how you will raise your children in the church.

Your convictions seem clear to me and you thought they were equally shared.  Now it appears that maybe they aren't as aligned as you thought.  You do realize that to get married in a Catholic church you can choose not to join BUT you do have to pledge to raise all your children in the Catholic faith.  That wording is in the actual wedding vows.  At least that is how it was for my niece who married a Catholic recently.  She was also required to do some joint premarital counseling with a Catholic Father prior to the marriage.

Which is going to cause issues, as it\u2019s confusing and has no boundaries. \n\nMy parents aren\u2019t overly religious, I\u2019m not religious at all. We varied heavily on parts of our wedding, keeping cultural elements we enjoyed, and minimizing religious parts that we did not connect with. We had a united front when we discussed with family. And ironically, my dad and MIL were the only two who had some requests, but they couldn\u2019t even agree so it was all quashed. \n\nIn these situations, I\u2019m best when I write out my thoughts and feelings vs just saying on the fly.

We\u2019re talking weeks and weeks of classes and/or private consultation with a priest delving into your spiritual lives, which will require both of you to lie repeatedly or risk being turned away. You wouldn\u2019t be the first or last atheist couple to slog through that process by any means, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to feel okay doing so. Many parishes won\u2019t marry people who weren\u2019t confirmed Catholic specifically, even if both are happily and thoroughly Christian. It\u2019s also problematic that her grandfather\u2019s opinion is more important than yours right now.

It's YOUR wedding? If you can't make your own special day about what YOU WANT, then you need to learn to grow a spine first.\n\nAnd she does. She needs to learn how to stick up for herself against what her family wants. In reality, they'll either come or not, they'll grumble about the venue or not, and they'll support her or not.

I asked my sister to officiate, because in PA, you can \"self marry\" -- you don't actually need a minister to do it, you just fill out the marriage license form and get your certificate.

She may want the kids to go to a Catholic school. Would you be willing? Honestly, my boyfriend is atheist and said if we had kids they would got to a catholic school.

It's a religious site and ceremony, not a pretty building and scripted lines. \n\nShe's also wrong about marriage being about two families coming together.

I suspect OP's GF isn't really atheist and is just a non-practicing Catholic, who hasn't gone to church in years but, always figured when she had kids she would go back to mass \"for them to be raised Catholic\".

However, they did go through a pre-marriage counseling program.\n\nToday, the Catholic partner in a \u201cmixed\u201d marriage is the one who is supposed to promise to raise children in the Catholic Church.  The non-Catholic parent doesn\u2019t have to make that promise.\n\nTo OP\u2019s point, if BOTH partners aren\u2019t willing and prepared to go through the premarital counseling process, I can\u2019t see a Catholic priest agreeing to marry them\u2014inside a church or not.", "Personal experience here. I was raised Catholic. My husband was not. He had to get baptized, a confession, a marriage class, and attend church on occasion before the wedding.

It\u2019s took literal YEARS because they kept asking for significant \u201cdonations\u201d and she was a single parent with very little money so always refused.

There isn\u2019t really a \u201cno fault\u201d annulment. My uncle was married for around 4 years to his ex-wife and they had a child, and then he wanted to get married to his current wife, and the annulment process was very emotional and I guess the Church allowed the ex-wife and her parents to be present for reading of the essays that my family wrote about her, and that caused a lot of tension and pain. The annulment wasn\u2019t even granted I don\u2019t think. \n\nMy uncle somehow was able to get re-married in a church but I don\u2019t recall the exact circumstances (it was apparently very short notice and small, I don\u2019t even think his parents knew it was happening).

It sounds like OP never would have dated her if she were religious. It\u2019s like she is asking him to change a core part of his identity to accommodate her grandfather. They can\u2019t just call up the church and schedule a ceremony. Asking him to get married is the church is equivalent to asking him to convert and go to months of marriage counseling with church religious leaders. That\u2019s what it means to get married in the church. You have to actually be part of the church and go through the process to get permission to marry in the church.

I'm just saying that the trials and tribulations are added on with in laws", "Yes, and that's partly what I'm saying.  You and your wife recognize that there is baggage in the form of in-laws, so when you married, you presumably sat down and talked out how that would be handled.  I guess my point is that, even if you've set aside who deals with which family members, you've both meshed and it's a group effort.", "Interesting. I wonder why my dad didn't have to. He did the counseling and all the pre marriage Catholic stuff, but didn't join the church.", "Yep. We had pressure from both sides to baptize our kid. This was after we got married by a judge.

I never read a statement from my dad but then again I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to hear any reasoning from him because from my mom and her witnesses\u2019 viewpoints, he did horrible as a husband and most certainly as a father.  My mom will only really say now that it was hard and she was t even getting remarried at that point, she did it as a \u201cjust in case\u201d she remarried in the church.
