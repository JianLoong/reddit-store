I have a strong overall disdain for organized religion, and believe the world would be better off without it. So I told her that I absolutely would not want to get married in a church. I don't want one of the most important moments of my life to be intertwined with religion. I made it clear this wasn't something I wanted to compromise on.\n\nShe was upset when I told her that, reiterating how important it is for her and her grandpa. I told her it isn't his wedding, but ours, and she told me that it's supposed to be between two families coming together, and that I'm being selfish by not considering her family too. This went on until it got kinda tense, and we decided to table the discussion before it turned into an argument.\n\nHer comment about my being selfish caught me off guard though.

Talk to any priest and they'll explain that Catholic marriage vows are based in a declaration of consent, or Catechism #1625-1631. To initiate this declaration, the officiating priest will ask three questions of the couple tying the knot.\n\n\"\\[Name\\] and \\[name\\], have you come here to enter into marriage without coercion, freely and wholeheartedly?\"\n\n\"Are you prepared, as you follow the path of marriage, to love and honor each other for as long as you both shall live?\"\n\n\"Are you prepared to accept children lovingly from God and to bring them up according to the law of Christ and his Church?\"\n\nThe answer to each of these three questions should be \"I have\" or \"I am.\"\n\nIn other words, you and your atheist fianc\u00e9e would have to promise to raise your children as religious.\n\nThe priest might also say they won't do a service for you if you aren't attending church in the first place.\n\nI understand your fianc\u00e9e is wanting to make her grandfather happy, but you need to both ask yourself whether you would be willing to lie as part of your wedding vows (assuming you don't plan on raising your children as Catholics).", "I'm Lutheran and married an Episcopalian, so I don't know much about Catholic weddings except I thought you had to both do certain specific things before being allowed to marry in a Catholic church.  For example, pre-marital counseling (which is not a bad thing), but also that you swear you will raise your children Catholic and other items like that.  I wanted to get married in a church but if my husband had wanted me to do a Catholic wedding, I'm not sure I would have wanted to.  \n\nIt may be about blending families, but this sounds more like it's her way or not.  I'm not sure there is a compromise here, but her grandfather's relationship with her should be second to yours with her.  you're NTA", "NTA I don't think your girlfriend has thought this thru. It varies by diocese but one of you has to be baptized and in good standing with the church. You have to go thru pre-cana counseling. It's not as simple as calling up the rectory and trying to schedule a wedding.", "NTA. I\u2019d ask her why her grandpa\u2019s opinion/feelings are carrying more weight than her future HUSBAND. That is concerning to me. Marriage is the coming together of two PEOPLE. Not all their families opinions and baggage.", "NTA\n\nBeing selfish goes both ways and IMO her wanting to marry in a church because it's what her grandfather wants is a weaker reason than not getting married because of your own (non) beliefs.", "NTA.  How does she think she's going to get married in a Catholic church while being an atheist and you being anti-theist?", "Not religious and not raised religious. But NTA. I don't think hard limits are selfish, they are just something you have to workout as a couple. \n\nMy understanding is that you can't just show up at a Catholic church to get married, you are supposed to be Catholic. So you probably need to look into that before agreeing. Your fiancee might still count if she was raised Catholic, while you are possible not baptised and not confirmed.\n\nAlso, what other religious ceremonies does she think need to be done? You do need to talk to her about how often you are going to be expected to go to church (Christmas and Easter Mass being major deals and time you spend with family). Then of course, what happens with any children?", "INFO: Is there a plan for if/when you have kids?\n\n\"My grandfather wants the kid baptized, confirmed and in church every week.

You are NTA for not wanting to get married in the church. As a matter of fact, you would kinda be an asshole of you did. If you AND your fiancee are atheists, I think the family would find it more insulting to see the wedding in a church, as it almost makes a mockery of the vows. \n\nIf your wife was a practicing Catholic and it was important to HER and not just her family, this would be a totally different conversation. But if you're both atheists the meaning behind a church wedding is null.\n\nAlso, my sister married a protestant and the church didn't even let them do a full mass, because her husband was not Catholic, so even if you agreed to get married in the church, I don't think the church would allow that.", "No, this isn\u2019t about two FAMILIES coming together.

Plus you can\u2019t pretend you\u2019re Catholic for a day just to get married in a Catholic Church so you can appease the relatives.  The church doesn\u2019t allow that.

I'd do the outside wedding and let her have her priest there, if she needs, to bless the marriage. That should definitely suffice. One red flag though, she is suddenly wanting the Catholic way and church bc it means so much to her?? Either she is atheist like she said,  or she was just saying that to be like you thought she was to get you to marry her, if so, once you have kids is she going to want to raise them in Catholic way too and make you all go to Sunday Mass?? Or take your kids to Catholic mass without you?? That is even more concerning, imo. Totally becoming not who you thought she was and completely changing y'alls entire relationship. Next thing you know, you'll have advent candles, Wednesday Ashes for  Ash Wednesday, no meat on Fridays during lent,... all the Catholic traditions. Catholic faith is very traditional. I suggest talking at length about all of this before going any further with wedding planning. A marriage isn't about having a \"perfect day\" for the bride as \"she always dreamed\".  It is a lifetime and lifestyle commitment where two people who are similar in core beliefs merge to create their own family based on shared values. If y'all really don't share values on this core issue, the marriage will not work.", "NTA.  She is only wanting a church wedding to appease the family. She doesn't believe in it.

If they are paying, you may have to do it their way.", "NTA, but you know they don't just \"let\" you get married in a Catholic Church right? There's meetings with the priest about your faith and how you will raise your children in the church. It's not just a family member goes to the church, makes a donation, and you get to have the wedding in the church kind of deal.", "NTA and I think even if you were on board you would have a very hard time finding a priest willing to officiate", "NTA. Both parties need to respect boundaries and preferences to maybe make a compromise. Your fianc\u00e9e needs to respect the fact that you do not want to get married in a church and that the day will be just as magical anywhere else.", "Does she realize the process that it takes to get married in a Catholic Church? You have to go through marriage counseling with the priest and a bunch of other stuff. Google it. Why would two atheists do that?? NTA. She knows that you are both religious.

She is the one being selfish here by wanting you to lie about your faith.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your fiance is.\n\nI am religious.  We don't want people using a church as a \"pretty setting\" for a wedding.  Getting married, with religious vows, means something to us.  Your fiance just wants to use the church and not be a part of it.", "NTA. Would Catholics even let you get married in their church if you aren\u2019t Catholic? Isn\u2019t it sacrilegious to them? \n\nYour GF isn\u2019t marrying her grandpa, she\u2019s marrying you. A big part of who you are is your ideology and worldview.

Your convictions seem clear to me and you thought they were equally shared.  Now it appears that maybe they aren't as aligned as you thought.  You do realize that to get married in a Catholic church you can choose not to join BUT you do have to pledge to raise all your children in the Catholic faith.  That wording is in the actual wedding vows.  At least that is how it was for my niece who married a Catholic recently.  She was also required to do some joint premarital counseling with a Catholic Father prior to the marriage.  If your fianc\u00e9e's family is devout, they may not even consider your marriage valid if it occurs outside of the church.  \n\nOutdoor weddings are lovely, and I hope you two can agree to follow your true beliefs and have one.", "NTA \n\nThere are so many \u201ctraditions\u201d that are tied to religion.

If you decide to have kids, and her grandfather says when\u2019s the baptism, what then? It feels like she has a moving target when it comes to her belief in atheism. Which is going to cause issues, as it\u2019s confusing and has no boundaries. \n\nMy parents aren\u2019t overly religious, I\u2019m not religious at all. We varied heavily on parts of our wedding, keeping cultural elements we enjoyed, and minimizing religious parts that we did not connect with. We had a united front when we discussed with family. And ironically, my dad and MIL were the only two who had some requests, but they couldn\u2019t even agree so it was all quashed. \n\nIn these situations, I\u2019m best when I write out my thoughts and feelings vs just saying on the fly.

Question:  Does SHE want the wedding, or is she suffering from family pressure to do things \"their way?\"\n\nI get the distinct impression that she's trying to keep the peace here and it may be incumbent on you to tolerate the religious setting so that she can have a better relationship with her family after the marriage.\n\nSome moral stances aren't worth the stress.  It's a few hours in a building where God is worshipped.  I think you'll survive those few hours in a setting you don't wholly approve of better than your soon to be wife will handle the collective disappointment of her entire side of the family.

Good luck.", "NTA for sticking to your beliefs but TA for not accommodating your partner.\n\nIn my opinion, do both ceremonies. Have a small (emphasis on the word small) ceremony in a church for her family and what members of your family can suck it up and sit in said church for a couple of hours. If she wants to do it for her Grandfather, just do it and if the rest of her family wants to have a religious ceremony, they can pay for it.\n\nOnce the religious ceremony is out of the way, have a civil ceremony in the outdoors for the rest of your family and friends.
