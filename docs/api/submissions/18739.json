Tackle, no.\n\nWell my 10yo came screaming into the house last week because his arm was broken. From what? Playing tackle football. Flash forward today and I ran into one of the neighbors who is a 4th grade teacher.\n\nHe asked about my son's arm and I said he's doing better. He then laughed and said that was good because he couldn't believe the hit that he took. I asked if he saw them playing tackle football and he said yes.\n\nI asked why didn't you stop them? You're a teacher. You teach 10yo boys. If you see kids doing dangerous things then you're responsible for saying something. \n\nHe said the boys aren't his kids. I said that's irrelevant. Like you would had been a hero in my book if you'd said something. Even a text!

They play with other neighborhood boys between the ages of 10 and 13. The issue we had was that they were playing tackle football and we parents put an end to that. Touch football, yes. Tackle, no.\n\nWell my 10yo came screaming into the house last week because his arm was broken. From what? Playing tackle football. Flash forward today and I ran into one of the neighbors who is a 4th grade teacher.\n\nHe asked about my son's arm and I said he's doing better. He then laughed and said that was good because he couldn't believe the hit that he took. I asked if he saw them playing tackle football and he said yes.\n\nI asked why didn't you stop them? You're a teacher. You teach 10yo boys. If you see kids doing dangerous things then you're responsible for saying something. \n\nHe said the boys aren't his kids. I said that's irrelevant. Like you would had been a hero in my book if you'd said something. Even a text!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
