You're talking about having \\*rules\\* not boundaries, and that's totally fine.\n\nThis is an easy ESH because either party could have taken 3 seconds out of their day and asked, you know, with words.", "Will always provide a place to sleep for someone who shouldn't drive because of intoxication.

This seems to be a weird expectation, in fact I would prefer to sleep in my own bed.", "I am going with NTA because there was no mention of an overnight bag or anything. Who plans on spending the night without talking about it. Only exception would be they were trashed & then they could couch surf.", "NTA and regardless of distance, it\u2019s rude to assume you can stay the night without asking", "Nta.  You are a friend not a free hotel. Not your fault they made an assumption.", "NTA. If they lived far away I would understand, but I'm also betting you'd have accounted for that too. But you said in another comment they're only about a half hour away so no, not even a little bit. Let us all remember the hidden meaning behind the word ASSUME. Clearly they forgot.", "NTA\n\nAnd they only live half an hour away? So weird! Hahaha", "So sorry, I didn't realize you would be spending the night.  There are recliners in the family room you can sleep on, but you should know I need to leave at 5 AM for (fill in the blank) so I will wake you at 4:30 so you can leave before I lock up, but otherwise, sure, feel free to spend the night.   Then follow through, even if you don't have anywhere to be.  Next time, they will ask first.  NTA", "NTA but\u2026 some things are just off here. It sounds like perhaps the communication on both sides is lacking. Have they ever been to your home before? Do they frequently try and have you stay overnight in their home? \n\nIn the future, note that if you allow someone to leave your home and you knew they were intoxicated or you served them to excess you can be found legally liable for any consequences of that in many jurisdictions. You\u2019re also morally culpable. If that\u2019s not something you can handle, don\u2019t host with alcohol involved. Some of your comments are giving the well it\u2019s not my problem vibe, which is somewhat troubling.", "IMO, NTA. Maybe I'm alone here, but who just assumes they're sleeping over at someone's house if they haven't been explicitly invited to? \n\nEdit: Hit comment too fast", "Yeah just taking a glance back at these comments, it looks like something is definitely a bit strange here. If someone is drinking enough at your home that they would not be able to drive, you need to be proactive about making sure they can stay with you or they have an alternative way home. That's not something you would do for a stranger, of course, but this is a friend and you have a mutual obligation to each other.", "Yeah, no, the problem is *not* your communication. Are you going to add \"but you can't sleep at my house\" to all your evening plans from here on in? That is something you *should* be able to safely take as a given. I've *never* had friends specify that, and yet it's understood. \n\nYour friends are either just plain weird, or they have a very different circle of friends they *usually* hang out with, where the assumption is that everyone crashes at everyone else's house, and they just thought that was how *everyone* did things. If it's the latter, I'd cut them some slack, but otherwise? No.", "Yup, we had drinks. No, the plans were primarily us catching up (alcohol optional). No, our nights (with all my friends) usually end with drawn-out goodbyes outside the host\u2019s home. Then a lot of \u201ctext when you\u2019re home safe.\u201d\n\nNope, my guest room only has a bed for one person, which they\u2019ve seen before. So apart from assuming they\u2019d spend the night, it also looks like they assumed I\u2019d let them sleep in my bed. Those are bold and unrealistic assumptions, I think.", "Yeah, my commute can be around 1:30 each way some days. A good day is 45 minutes to work and 1:15 home.", "This reminds me of the old SNL bit \"the things that wouldn't leave.\" \n\nPer Miss Manners: thank them for coming by and wish them a safe trip home. If that doesn't work, Clean up any mess from entertaining. Next step, vacuum the floor. If they still don't take the hint, tell them you are saying good night and to please remember to lock the door when they leave. Then turn out the lights and go to bed.", "Same here, but we make our expectations for the visit clear beforehand. I don\u2019t just invite myself to stay the night in secret.", "So you were completely surprised by their assumption? Like no idea they would have thought that?", "My grandpa was known to say to his wife, \u201cwe\u2019d better go to bed so these people can leave.\u201d", "Yes, naturally. It wasn\u2019t communicated.\n\nBut I feel like you already have an opinion about me, and that\u2019s okay.", "lol a bit 'Oh yeah we're BOTH planning getting wasted tonight and crash at your place but we're not going to mention it till around 11:45pm'", "That's a good line! I might steal it. With friends I just smile apologetically and say, \"I gotta kick you out now.\"", "NTA and no I genuinely don't have much of an opinion on you. At a glance at your post history and I think you're probably in the right here. I just couldn't get a sense of what was actually going on given that your comments seemed pretty unclear and a lot of people here try to leave out stuff they know is super relevant. In your case, I think they were making big assumptions and maybe your communication styles were so different that you didn't pick up on it, but that's on them.", "Honestly I can't imagine spending an evening with a couple or single friend that I wasn't familiar enough to have this expectation. \n\nLike I wouldn't be at your house by myself on Friday night if we weren't that close.", "I'm pretty sure you two are on the same page here and you're both talking about it slightly differently.", "I respect that. I can see why people would leave out important bits, but I genuinely wanted to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable so I can work on being a better friend.", "No I don't think you're being unreasonable, I think they are.", "Perhaps next time offer to call a local hotel to check availability. NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t sleep over unless previously agreed upon or offered by the host. Bringing it up out of the blue on their parts was gauche.", "NTA - they're only half an hour away, so that wasn't a reasonable assumption for them to make.", "NTA, but it seems an odd thing to just assume. Could it be a cultural difference? Some cultures have hospitality rules of behavior that defers to guests. That's is the only explanation I can come up with why two adults wouldn't want to sleep in their own bed if they can. 30 min is not far enough away to not be worth it. Was the weather really bad?", "Maybe...

You\u2019re not necessarily obligated, but nobody was being a good friend either.", "Unless there is some precedent set unmentioned this is really odd. Maybe try a follow up talk?

The only way I could get him out of my house was to be rude and abusive to him.\n\nFinally I realized that the only way to feel better about myself was to cut the guy completely out of my life. He'd catch rides over to my house with other friends who came to visit and I wouldn't let him inside so he'd sit in their car waiting until they left.

I was planning on a taxi and returning thr next day fir the car but hosts insisted I stay.", "Some countries 25Km is another city btw haha, and if they\u2019re drinking or tired I guess\u2026I have friends for whom it\u2019s norm we can crash after a certain time.\n\nOP, imho NAH I think it was a misunderstanding. Doubt they meant to guilt you, rather to try and say they\u2019re not high maintenance and put you at ease about being prepared (most people are like that, I\u2019m guessing). But i personally hate that cause it\u2019s actually that bad if I say I can\u2019t host - and I don\u2019t need to be forced to specify how badly unprepared I am. F right off. All good in the end if you\u2019re real friends, I just apologize and thank them for understanding I just couldn\u2019t host that one time. And I\u2019m honest of being embarrassed of the fact, I wish I was a Martha Stewart always ready to go homes - but nope, I\u2019m just not. I\u2019m messy at times, and I like to keep my mess to myself.", "Yea I know just wanted to know for personal reasons if 2,5 is a lot or not. Since 6 is definitely a lot", "Take a chill pill they made a mistake \nIt\u2019s hilarious how you go off assuming they\u2019re entitled terrible people", "How old are you and are you and your friends mostly single? There was a time in my life where the informal sleepover was a non-issue. That is no longer the case.", "At 2.5 hours, I\u2019d bring it up during planning, whether as the host or as the guest.", "Wait they said it was a drink and two shots over the course of 7 hours though, right? Admittedly I'm someone who doesn't drink at all but I was under the impression that after that many hours and that little drinks, someone's okay and haven't been over served", "That still would have been them assuming and OP would be NTA\n\nmaybe OP could have realized they assumed earlier but they are still TA for making some weird leap that they could stay over", "My dad, opa, and grandpa all used to slap their thighs, stand up and say \"Well! I won't keep you any longer!\"\n\nThen, of course, they'd all stand around at the door talking for another 30 minutes. And at the end of the driveway for another 45. \n\nI noticed, recently, that I do the same thing.", "..i take it you never actually told him  that? Poor glen.", "I am cool with crashing, but unless it is explicitly said, everyone is expected to go home and sleep on his own bed. We are all adults who can figure out how to get home.\n\nI don't want to wake up the next morning to find guests, serve breakfast and everything when I could enjoy staying in bed. If you host the evening, you shouldn't be expected to host 24h. If you have a house, you should be past the frat boys parties age", "I once said, \"Well, I'm home.  Why aren't you? \". This was after every hint had failed.", "My Nana always asks, \"Have you got your bus fare?\" when she's had enough. We all drive \ud83d\ude02", "Hang on a minute, were you all drinking alcohol? If you watched them drink, knowing you\u2019d be asking them to leave later that may have been a bit assholey of you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it matters at all how far someone has travelled. You don\u2019t just expect to sleep at someone\u2019s house when it hasn\u2019t even been discussed.", "My favorite thing to say is \"I'm tired now you should leave.\" Works every time", "NTA\n\nYou can't just assume that you're spending the night at someone else's house, that's just weird AF.", "NTA. Regardless of how far away they live,  you said you were only available Saturday. When someone stays at your place, that means doing stuff the next day, too. Making coffee, getting breakfast stuff around, waiting for them to get up so you can leave... bare minimum stuff still interrupts your day.", "INFO: Are you Cinderella?", "NTA. When you invite people over, they don't get to demand and try to guilt you into a sleepover. Boundaries are healthy op.  Never feel bad for having and maintaining them. You don't owe anyone space in your home for any reason.", "NTA. I live in Chicago & I have friends in Milwaukee. It\u2019s @1.5hr (@90mi)drive. We would have what we called Self Care Saturday once a month to get together, eat, drink, smoke, watch streaming, etc. we alternated between cities. Depending on who\u2019s place it was at in Milwaukee (one had a spare bedroom), I would ask \u201cif it was ok to crash overnight instead of driving home. *So I didn\u2019t have to stop drinking/smoking by 8pm.* And if I was hosting, I would offer to let them crash for the same reason if I didn\u2019t have plans afterwards. This was all done ahead of time once we picked the Saturday. It was never assumed bc we didn\u2019t know if each other had plans afterwards or would have their bf/fwb over for the night. \n\nYour friends are entitled AH\u2019s for assuming you would provide lodging for such a short trip without asking & thinking you had nothing to do after your get together. And the audacity to guilt trip you when they realized you weren\u2019t gonna fall for the okey doke just blew me.", "INFO : Did they both drinks alcohol ?", "NTA. Even if everyone had been drinking, the response is \"how long did uber give you\" or \"do you need me to dial a taxi?\" Lol, no one just invites themselves to stay the night, unless, you know you're into that \ud83d\ude09", "15.5 miles?? Even if they were wasted that\u2019s still a reasonable Uber/Taxi ride home. \n\nNTA your friends are straight-up high.", "My commute to work is longer than that. NTA.", "LOLOL NTA", "I\u2019m going YTA as they\u2019ve hosted you previously and you\u2019ve kicked them out to drive home after drinking which you\u2019d witness them doing. \n\nI get you didn\u2019t want them to stay but the vast majority of people would insist they stay and realised by the fact they where drinking they expected to stay over. Only having a single bed is a lame excuse.", "Maybe because of alcohol consumption?", "I mean, I did move into the office once because my commute was 32 minutes. I sure did miss the wife and kids, but if I went home. I'd only have 13 or 14 hours before I had to be back at the office. I did het home on long weekends, though.", "They had a couple of drinks hours before, I\u2019m guessing at lunch, so they would have been fine to drive home close to midnight", "3 drinks, 7 hours before they left. He said it in another comment", "Most people \u201cin Europe\u201d just don\u2019t drink if they know they are driving home/have one designated driver who stays sober.", "TIL that bars are supposed to have a place for people to sleep.", "Mid 30s married. Not having kids though.", "I don't know. Well yes the friends could be considered TA for assuming, but once the misunderstanding happened I think op is also TA for making their friends drive home when they've been drinking. Op could've just told them to get out very early next morning if op had stuff to do.", "The old Minnesota goodbye!", "Yeah I feel kinda bad for Glen. Likely on the spectrum to boot.", "Well I don't know what 'frat boy party' age is, as I was never in a frat, but my wife's friend crashed at our house last night. Now they're taking her dog for a walk so im sleeping in, but I'll probably get up and make mimosas for everyone. They'll probably spend the next couple of hours chatting and watching Wednesday, I'll be playing persona 5 then watching a soccer game. We're all in our 30s and loving life. \n\nI'm sorry you had to choose an age to stop having having fun.", "OP didn\u2019t make them drive. Just didn\u2019t give them a place to stay. They could have taken a cab or bus. Or slept in their cars. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that any of those are awesome options but I don\u2019t think OP is TA for not taking responsibility for their friend\u2019s bad / rude decision making. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to put yourself in a bad position by being irresponsible and then make someone else the villain for not accommodating your weird behaviour.", "Making your friends take a cab/bus for 25km drive and make them come back that same drive to get their car the next day is an AH move in my books especially when op didn't give any solid reason why the friends couldn't stay, op just didn't want them to stay. Also making you friends sleep in their car in your driveway if they can't afford a cab and there isn't a bus they could take is a super AH move.\n\nI don't know how you treat your friends, but I would never do that to my friends, so that's why I think ESH.", "OP didn\u2019t make them do a damn thing lol \n\nI think it\u2019s super sketch when people try to make other people accountable for their choices"]}
