A visit is a visit. Unless you live in an island with no way to leave, you see your friend and then you leave.", "Lol my sister has in-laws who did this when she invited them over for a holiday meal. After the first (and only) time it happened, she would make sure to mention that I would be spending the night in their one and only guest room.

Boundaries are made to protect yourself, not other people's feelings.", "NTA\n\nINFO:  how long was their drive?  have they slept over in the past?\n\nUnless it was a 2+hour drive it's very presumptuous to assume it's a sleep over. Staying the night on a visit is very specific and one shouldn't presume.  Even if they've stayed over 10 x in the past 3 months - they should have always checked to make sure.", "NTA. it's weird they thought you would be hosting.

I really appreciate everything you\u2019ve said, and making me feel sane. Also, thank you for all the advice. \nKey takeaways from this: \n- I should be direct when communicating.\n- I should probably revaluate our relationship. No one should feel like this after a day with friends.\n- I definitely need to stay in therapy.

They\u2019ve driven completely hammered many times (which I don\u2019t endorse). This is why we have ride hailing apps. Nope, my home is catered for me and ONE guest (single bed), not couples. For couples to feel comfortable, I\u2019d have to surrender my room for them.", "The friends in question only live about a 30 minute drive away. I don't know how they thought they would need other sleeping arrangements in any case.", "You\u2019re right. I should have communicated that better. Noted for all future plans with them.", "Oh wow. \ud83d\ude02 This is hilarious.", "I agree with this, and thank you. I\u2019ve mentioned that I\u2019ve slept over at theirs in a diff thread, and leaving tends to be as awkward. Even after I\u2019d mentioned the exact time I\u2019m leaving their home, I\u2019d still get the insistent pleas of staying longer. \n\nI always leave feeling like I\u2019m some sort of glue for their relationship. It may not be true, it\u2019s just how I feel.", "Yup, I\u2019ve slept over at their place. Then it was planned and they\u2019d extended the invite. I\u2019d also confirmed how long I\u2019m willing to stay (introvert). No breakfast mentioned. I answered the drinking on a diff thread.\n\nI have a 2br townhouse. My room and a guest room with a single bed (one person). Since I wasn\u2019t expecting to host (let alone two people), this arrangement would have left at least one of us uncomfortable.", "OP said in a comment that they live about 15 miles away so a 30 minute drive, very odd to think it would be a sleepover with a commute that short unless they were drinking heavily or anything to that effect.", "Some drinking happened, but not enough to impair your driving. Also, when I plan on drinking  a lot, I feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to plan my safe return home.\n\n100%. That\u2019s a red-flag I\u2019ve neglected to unpack.", "Lol. Oh no, I\u2019m not in the UK. The one friend\u2019s office is about a 7-minute drive from me.  So their commute to work is longer, and they don\u2019t seem to mind the distance.", "Just wanna point out, in the UK we do not expect to stay over  when we live 30 mins away. But we also make clear whether or not were inviting people to stay over.", "but seriously would you ever think that if you invited friends over for a visit that they'd expect to stay all night?  ie 'Come over - we can go bowling & I'll make dinner' and then they pull out their over night bag and ask where they're sleeping??? Who does that?", "Yup! I admit my fault in that part.", "Already answered 23m ago", "o_0\n\nWhy on earth would they think that they would spend the night for such a ridiculously short commute? Did you ask their reasoning?", "Why would they think they could stay over? We\u2019re they drinking?", "That's a ridiculously short commute to expect to sleep over. NTA", "Were you drinking and were your plans primarily around drinking / hanging out? If yes, does your friend group usually crash at whoever's house is hosting if that's the primary activity?\n\nBecause it sounds like you're being awfully coy and you knew they might have assumed they were spending the night, but decided not to proactively say anything and just let them assume.", "I had to laugh. Who in their right mind would expect a sleepover without mentioning anything, living so close? NTA. Those don't seem to be very nice friends from the look of it.", "ohh okok that clears it up, definitely odd that theyd just assume to stay when home was close enough", "It's still not your fault. They were being unreasonable guests. If they didn't say anything about staying the night before they got there you had no reason to think it would be an issue that could come up.", "I doubt there will be many future plans", "Hey, sisters need to stick together! I actually drove home after they left one time because I had a catering gig the next morning. In my pj's, of course. \ud83d\ude09", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck in an awkward situation. Best luck with it!!", "Yes I saw that too - very odd.  People commute to work every day further than that.", "Oops. Lol! They have no excuse then.", "Nope, I totally agree. The friends are just totally AH, lol!", "It\u2019s like you were here. Lol. If it\u2019d been a planned overnight thing, that\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d discuss. This way people can go straight to bed when they want to.", "Unfortunately not. At this point I just wanted them to leave.", "Wtf? I crash at friends houses all time with a 30 minute drive. \n\nBecause we're drinking.", "Yes that's really odd.  If I thought I was staying over at a friends (lol well first up I'd make sure THAT was the plan way a head of time) but I'd have my overnight bag with me when I came in the door and ask where I should put it, before starting our fun.  \n\nI could see that if the guests got too drunk to drive home safely a friend would insist they stay on the couch / a sleeping bag etc and boot their hungover butts out the next morning when you needed to leave, but it doesn't sound like That was the case either.", "I\u2019m glad this works for you. Unfortunately, I believe that if you\u2019re gonna make an active decision to drink over the driving limit, it\u2019s also your responsibility to make sure you have a plan to get home safely. There are exceptions to this though, because life happens.", "That\u2019s true. Spontaneous sleepovers can happen after many drinks, but this is usually extended by the host (when it\u2019s clearly dangerous for them to leave). But taking time to pack a bag, and not taking time to tell the host you\u2019re sleeping over is bizarre.", "Naw my friends and I are cool with people crashing, if you're invited over for an evening it's assumed you have a place to stay unless work is an issue.\n\n'The plan' is my guest room or an air mattress. \n\nIf you don't have a free bed then that's one thing, but we all have houses now, so that that isn't an issue.", "We have different takes on this, and that\u2019s fine.", "But it's implicitly agreed upon, you have a well established story with these people. If you visited people whose habits you were less familiar with, would you assume it would be the same or clarify prior?"]}
