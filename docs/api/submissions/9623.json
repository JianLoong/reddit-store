Like he'd insist he made more sacrifices than I did, and when I pointed out all the things I sacrificed for him, he came up with convoluted reasons why those things weren't \"real\" sacrifices. It didn't matter that he was, objectively, wrong. He still wouldn't change his mind, and continued behaving as if he was right. So there was no point to all my effort.\n\nYour husband isn't interested in fairness or truth. He wants you do do what he wants, when he wants it, without complaint. He is controlling and he's not just going to let go of that because you show him how much you do. He will just find ways to twist everything around so that you continue to look incompetent and he looks like the suffering martyr. \n\nI would advise you to see a therapist, ALONE, and figure out if this is a pattern in your relationship and how to undo the damage he is doing to your self-worth. And if he complains about you seeing a therapist (he almost certainly will), or refuses to do what's needed to support that (like maybe watching his own children for an hour or two), consider why he is so opposed to you taking care of yourself.

Do it!", "NTA Instead of filming everything you do just don\u2019t do anything for a week. It\u2019ll pile up pretty quick and he\u2019ll see for himself what you do. Relax, take naps with your youngest, don\u2019t do dishes, don\u2019t do laundry, don\u2019t pick up around the house. If he thinks you don\u2019t do anything then don\u2019t.", "Life would be easier if the parent who is out at work all day realized that taking care of an infant and a two-year-old (even when the older child is in daycare) is time-consuming and exhausting.", "NTA\n\nOr just take a three day weekend and leave it all to him; see how he likes it.\n\nJeebus, I cannot stand husbands who think they are their wife's boss.", "It might be time to call \"Mom\" yours or his to come stay with you to help out.  I hope you got a good MIL who will ream him a new asshole.   Call her to complain about his fits.", "I STAH and one time my fianc\u00e9 came home from work in a bad mood and pulled this crap on me and I flat out told him \u201cyeeeah that\u2019s not how this works\u201d. I stopped cooking, cleaning, packing lunches, doing his laundry NOTHING. After three days he apologized he couldn\u2019t take it. \u201cWhelp apparently I do nothing around here right?\u201d 100% backfired when he saw what doing nothing actually looks like. Do not prove jack shit to this asshat through a video. Just do for you and the kid and nothing for him.", "NTA but making a time lapse esp if you are moving around multiple rooms in your house and have to change the shot and edit each shot is gonna burn you out even more", "Pouting, slamming doors, using always/never language and \"the silent treatment\" are all indicators that, taken together,  point to abuse.  He's not interested in finding solutions to life's challenges.  He needs someone to blame. Guess who that is?", "YWNBTA\nDo it and then make him a chore list to do.\nWhen my youngest was a baby and my husband said oh look dishes in the sink..I said if it bothers you..do them . My hands are kind of full right now and when your done with that you can fold your laundry", "NTA\nIt boggles my mind people pay thousands of dollars just for someone to watch their kids but then when you have the responsibility of essentially TWO FULL TIME JOBS he's angry if you can't do everything.\nIt is not reasonable to expect you to do everything, especially with newborns and toddlers for crying out loud\n\nMy advice would take a few hours one Saturday at least and go out with friends to lunch. Pump for the baby if that's applicable. He will likely be a humbled man.", "Why is it always the age gap!!!! NTA", "NTA but it's time to leave him with the baby and \"go out for milk\". Takes about 8-10hrs to get milk. Come back and ask him why he didn't sweep the floors.", "NTA. He brought it upon himself, and the only thing it wod hurt is his ego. People have absolutely no respect for housewives and its extremely difficult. Also a lot of it is manual labor. If you were a professional cleaner, or private chef he would probably have so much more respect for what you do. But he takes your for granted.", "NTA. Buddy is 30 expecting his 22 y/o wife to be more like a 1940s then when he is presented with the idea of putting forth 10 minutes of his time and effort into getting what he is asking for instead of what I'd assume is go be lazy on the couch is mind baffling to me. I'd stop doing whatever your doing and truly show him how much you do.", "WNBTA! I wish I had the balls to do this! I have 3 kids, 9/2/7mo & in same boat!!", "NOPE! This actually is a very clever way of showing him just how draining a day of being a fully operational support system to a fully dependent (though incredibly cute and cuddly) human can be!  When discussing this after he watches the video (hopefully edited for effectiveness) with you\u2026ask him \u201cCan you imagine carrying an invalid around all day, never letting them out of your sight, watching constantly that they don\u2019t swallow something or choke or tip their head wrong or\u2026 (my son managed to stuff the corner of his blanket in his mouth and suffocate himself until his breathing stopped.  I performed CPR and brought him back after only a few seconds but it was TERRIFYING and draining!)\n\nThe point is that cleaning diapers, warming bottles all these things seem like small tasks\u2026and individually they really are.  But when you\u2019re up at night doing it, carrying the extra weight around all day, doing all these tasks WHILE keeping up with your regular tasks\u2026it\u2019s EXHAUSTING!  I took over almost all the household cleaning tasks for the first year while my wife got her body back in shape (her idea, ladies), regained her strength, took care of the infant while watching the 3 year old and we alternated getting up on odd and even nights thought out ever calendar month.  We organized the load so that neither of us was constantly doing everything.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t understand.  Maybe after he passes an 8lb kidney stone after 12 hours of agony and then takes on a second job for a year immediately after he does that\u2026maybe\u2026.  \n\nThis is a matter of a lack of communication.  Ask home to keep an open mind as he watches the video with you.  Explain that when your regular work day is interrupted with 108 interruptions that all take just 6 minutes and are not too difficult in themselves while you are exhausted from lack of sleep\u2026you just can\u2019t get everything done\u2026NO ONE CAN!  \n\nIf you are a home spouse after the child is going to school and you have that extra time and a full night sleep to refresh yourself and you STILL don\u2019t get the house work done\u2026maybe there\u2019s a reason for a SMALL complaint then.  But I can ABSOLUTELY ASSURE HIM that it would NOT be in his best interests to say so\u2026that\u2019s a ROOKIE MISTAKE!\n\nYNTA-he needs more patience.  Pray for him.", "NTA. Your husband, on the other hand? He should get launched into the sun.", " NTA-your full time job is caring for an infant. Cleaning and cooking is another job that is to be shared. Next time, ignore the tantrum and eat your lunch.", "As a mother of an infant who\u2019s husband constantly complains: NTA, please do it. I\u2019m begging you", "I mean if all she does is tidy, he probably wouldn't notice", "I hope she stopped.  If not start waking her up at 2 am or whenever four hours after she goes to bed is.", "Yeah but when that asshole is their other parent...", "They\u2019re not actually serious, stop being so dramatic.", "Would he be 28?", "Not just on this sub, r/twoxchromosomes, r/mommit and r/parenting are full of stories of women who got pregnant to much older men and are being abused or mistreated. It's heartbreaking and so common.", "jesus christ OP if you can get out, do it. you're basically his slave", "Did I trigger you by having an opinion?", "I was very glad when the math worked out in my favor with my younger husband!  35/2+7= 24.5. He was 26 at the time but loves to brag about me being his sexy ol coug!  \n\nThe ages in this are unbelievable. A child herself with 2 young kids and a wholly disturbed husband freaking out over rice.", "You only counting from when kid was born. You need to add almost a year + when OP started flirting with her", "While apparently not doing anything himself. They had rice, just not any cooked. Why couldn't he cook rice? It doesn't take that long.", "Maybe not even legal. How long were they dating before getting pregnant at 19?", "Yeah I've never been in a romantic relationship but I've had good friendships w thirty something's starting in my mid twenties and it wasn't a huge deal at least. But yeah to be older than me (26), and dating a literal teenager is beyond repulsive", "Well actually I did when kid was conceived which is 1 year rounded up. She likely was 19 then. She was 20 when the baby was born. And thats also why I said \u201c Wonder how old they were when they started dating.\u201d", "Idk with a newborn especially if they are nursing and don't want a bottle that would do it", "Honestly, there is just no information here. We have no idea how much you work, or how much he works.\n\nI'm guessing you are likely NTA because that's how all the AITA posts starting with \"I got married and had a baby at a ridiculously young age with an older man\" tend to pan out.", "NTA. Maybe instead of filming your day, you can film his temper tantrums so he can see what an AH he is.  And then let him figure out why he\u2019s remaking his own damn dinner", "NTA, seems like a lot of work when it would be easier to make your point by being out of town for a few days.", "WNBTA: I am a guy that had somewhat similar attitude, until one day I had no job and my wife had to provide for the family. First day I was very enthusiastic about keeping the house clean and preparing all the meals. Our son was with me at home. I believe I sat down once or twice during the day. I lasted for a week, then quality of my \"work\" fell drastically. Eventually it all worked out, I got a new job, and everything went back to \"normal\", but I always appreciate, and voice it, how my wife keeps runs the house!", "YWNBTA.\n\nBut I would just go on strike. Do things for you and your newborn. He can take care of your toddler and himself.", "Would there be any any point? This is a him problem, not a you problem. NTA anyways", "NTA. Do it and let us know what he says", "Please. You don\u2019t need to do that. What you should have done is given him the baby gone out yourself and let him take care of the baby for an hour so he appreciates you. And as your child gets older he will realize what it is you do Everytime he has to watch the youngling.", "NTA but this will probably make him more upset seeing how he treats you already. You deserve better i hope you see that one day.", "NTA.  It\u2019s so annoying when a husband comes home and complains when you have not long had a baby.  So many of us have experienced this.  You\u2019re doing all you can.  If you can record yourself then go ahead.  Give him the proof.  If you mean anything to him, then he will watch it, and if he doesn\u2019t apologise then at least you will know what he thinks of you.  I don\u2019t advise having more children with him if he doesn\u2019t support you.", "More exhausting but may be educational", "Most men who want to have a child with a 19 year old are not looking for the chance to be with someone as a real partner. They're looking for someone to do what they say. \n\nPlease stop having children with this person. The more you grow up, the more you will realize that he is taking advantage of you.", "I\u2019m probably gonna come under fire for this but if you are a stay at home mom/wife was the agreement that you would take care of the household duties? If that\u2019s your job then do it. \n\nAnd I wonder how sahm\u2019s claim to not have enough time in the day when single moms who also work out of the home manage to keep up with everything. \ud83e\udd14 \n\nI have no issues with sahp but i also know what it\u2019s like taking care of kids and a household. It just doesn\u2019t take hours upon hours every day to clean.", "NTA but honestly don't think it would matter either.  Your husband was determined to find fault with you over something stupid.  You could have dropped everything to start the rice right that second and he would have been pissed because you didn't already have it done, thus giving him a different angle to start the \"you never do anything\" fight.  It wasn't the rice... the rice just gave him an excuse.  \n\nMy biological paternal unit used to do that to my mother all the time and she never saw it for the red flag it was until it was too late.", "You are nta. Your gross old husband is for preying on a teenager, and abusing her. What he\u2019s doing is abuse\u2026", "Run", "What i did with my ex is made a huge , very visible, running to do list and crossed it off as I went. .even the smallest tasks. It helped with him pitching in  but he was a cheater so...bigger problems ended us.", "How long have you been w/ him?  22 w/ a 2 y/o so you were probably a teenager and he was 26?", "NTA \n\nThis would be a good time to have a look at your support system for when (not if) his abuse escalates and you need to escape. No one deserves to be treated like this", "You WNBTA he knows what you do he's a 30 yo man. He doesn't care. He married someone younger who he can manipulate to get his way. Good luck", "YWNBTA  but don't think it'll change his mind. You married an asshole, unfortunately.", "Divorce that idiot. No YWNBTA. You can do the recording but what if he refuses to watch it? It's difficult to win an argument against an intelligent person but impossible to do so against an Idiot.", "I agree. He\u2019s going to find something to br pissed off about next time. Abusers love to do this", "I know this seems trivial considering the abuse going on in this house, but can someone explain to me how it took 2.5 hours to cook rice? Am I missing something here because usually it takes max 10 minutes?? I can't seem to get past this detail!\n\nOP you shouldn't have to videotape yourself to prove your point, you are a trustworthy person and shouldn't have to explain yourself this way.  It sets a bad precedence! \nNTA", "Yikes! Another abusive older guy who knocked her up twice since she was barely legal and baby trapped her with 2 babies. She\u2019s too focused on them and being financially dependent on him that she can\u2019t focus on leaving a massive AH.\n\nNTA", "Well it is for troll posts...", "This should be the number one comment/call out when we see age differences like this.

He was 19 when we started dating and I was 22.  This was also 22 years ago and everybody thought it was weird for the woman to be the older party in the relationship but nobody would have raised eyebrow about a guy in his late 20's with an 18 or 19 year old girl.", "my sister is 17, i am 27/28 soon.
