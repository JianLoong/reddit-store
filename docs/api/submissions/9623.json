My husband (30M) and I dropped our eldest child (2M) at his day care and went shopping for a couple things we needed. \n\nWhen we got home I started to make our food and had gotten part way through when my husband groaned and mentioned we had no rice cooked. I told him to just go to the store (which would take less than five minutes there and back) and buy microwave rice for now and I\u2019ll cook the rice once we finish eating. \n\nHe instantly got moody and after I had finished cooking and was setting the table said he wasn\u2019t eating and started slamming around tidying, washing up and, eventually, making rice. \n\nWe didn\u2019t end up eating until 2.5 hours later and the food had to be remade. \n\nAfter eating in a very tense silence my husband asked why nothing in the house is ever done. He said that I don\u2019t do much in my day and the least I can do is keep the house organised and clean. \n\nI tidy every. single day.\nAll whilst wearing our \u2018newborn\u2019 (3 months M) in the carrier on my chest. \nI\u2019m exhausted and burnt out constantly from night feeding and staying on top of the house. \n\nSo, I want to record a timelapse of every single thing I do throughout the day up until our son comes home from daycare for a week and play it on our TV and ask my husband if he still thinks I do nothing. \n\nWIBTA if I did this?", "created_utc": 1676040838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ytxie/wibta_if_i_recorded_everything_i_did_during_my/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I know that\u2019s not possible I feel that\u2019s the only way you\u2019d get through to him. YWNBTA but I wonder if recording yourself is enough. He had a tantrum about rice which is uncalled for. Does he ever thank you for the things you do? Or compliment you? Is this new behavior him?", "NTA, but your husband is acting like one.  You have a 3mo baby and he\u2019s acting like this???  Does he even know what it\u2019s like to really care for a newborn???\n\nTry talking to him when you are both calm.  Maybe he is having some other issues that are leaking into this aspect of your life together.  Maybe he\u2019s just an AH, or maybe it\u2019s indicative of something else.", "NTA. I get it, the temptation to say , \"here! Look! See, you're wrong!\" is great but I wonder if instead of recording, you took inaction. For one day, don't carry out your usual tasks - except for childcare. Make it a mommy and baby day. Leave the house and let him truly appreciate the little things when he witnesses what happens when you actually drop the rope. After all, actions speak louder than words.", "YWNBTA , but you would if you considered his behavior any kind of normal.\n\nI mean, he literally threw a tantrum because he didn't have rice with his meal.\n\nYou shouldn't have to justify yourself.", "NTA, but I'm not so sure it'll change his mind, if he even bothers watching it. He's acting like a child, not an adult.", "I am so angry for you. He\u2019s being an uncaring ass and was unable to regulate himself enough to not throw a tantrum over rice. \nCaring for a newborn is a full time,  24 hour a day job. Housekeeping and cooking aside. \nYou shouldn\u2019t have to track what you do for him to understand that.", "YWNBTA, but I also don't know if it will get through to him.", "NTA but you have a bigger issue here. Besides the massive age gap and the fact that your husband at 28 had a baby with a 20 y/o he seems frankly abusive.\n\nHe\u2019s belittling your work and slamming things around. Over what? Not having pre-cooked rice?\n\nI don\u2019t think this is a solvable problem, and if you don\u2019t want to leave him at minimum please get some counseling", "YWNBTA", "NTA.  \nAlso, 28-year-olds who have children with 20-year-olds are probably immature. While you will or have grown up, he won't.", "NTA\u2026 but I have a better solution for you. Go away for three days and leave your husband alone with the child, go during the week; this is important! Write down all the things you would be doing on the days you are gone. \n\nYou come home happy and refreshed, and your husband gets a taste of what it\u2019s truly like for you being a SAHM. It\u2019s a win win! I also think the video recording will probably just annoy him and not get the reaction you\u2019d like.", "YWNBTA \nNah, a video wouldn\u2019t be disrespectful, it would be what he\u2019s asking to see : What you\u2019re doing through the day.", "I had to do this to open my wife's eyes over a different situation...\n\nEither he's unaware or a narcissist,  either way,  can't argue with proof. \n\nNTA", "Well, you could do that, but a better plan would be to go away for the weekend on your own.  Leave baby with husband and let him see how much he gets done.  Sometimes you don't understand it until you live it.  Since you probably don't want to leave a baby that young, you could try the video but it's not going to have the same impact.  NTA", " 22 years old with a 2 year old and I\u2019m assuming you probably didn\u2019t meet, get married, make and gestate a baby all in the same year? In that case this age gap is concerning, so it\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s beginning to get aggressive and unappreciative. Your husband was more than likely preying on a younger woman who he could manipulate into being his child bearing servant, and you\u2019re not living up to his fantasy. NTA but please try and think about what this behavior says about the kind of man your husband truly is.", "NTA.  Sounds like you have a third child in this grown man.", "YWNBTA because your husband is. It\u2019s totally normal be to exhausted and burnt out with a newborn. Your husbands gatekeeping is the issue, not the rice or tidiness.", "Just tell him he's an asshole, it's shorter and efortless.", "YWNBTA.  You have two small children while doing household chores, cooking, etc.  Your husband is the ah here.", "NTA.. Your husband is being childish. Obviously, by his reaction to you telling him to go get rice at the store, he really wanted you to go get the rice. His tantrum at the table, delaying dinner, and then questioning what you do in a day, is just plain disrespectful. As your husband/life partner/best friend, he should be very well aware of what you go through in a day. If not, he's not being observant nor paying attention when you've had conversations in the past. Making a video would be worthless at this point. Judging by his aforementioned actions, he'll either blow it off, not pay attention, and find something else to bitch about.\n\nMy wife had 3 months off of work when she gave birth to our daughter.

Do it. And remind him that breastfeeding a baby burns roughly 1800 calories a day. Of course your exhausted. They dont notice the fridge was cleaned out or that the mirrors in the house have been cleaned.  Or that you've gone through your children's outgrow clothes etc. He only sees the 5 cups in the sink even after you've washed dishes 2x today.", "Actually there\u2019s a better solution. Just stop doing unless it involves the baby. No cooking or cleaning. Full on stop. Remind him when he complains that you do nothing. NTA", "You WNBTA, but is this going to do anything to solve your problem? Extremely unlikely.", "YWNBTA. Doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019ll faze him. \u00dc are putting what everything and everyone needs in the house first. I don\u2019t care if he doesn\u2019t see it with his own eyes 24/7, but he certainly will see it when \u00dc record it.", "You have a 3 month old and he thinks you don\u2019t do much with your day?!?!?! How about on his day off you go out all day leave him with your child and then ask him if he thinks you do nothing all day.", "NTA! Don\u2019t waste your time recording. Your husband isn\u2019t going to miraculously understand your responsibilities from a spreadsheet. The problem comes from his lack of perspective. You really need to have heart to heart with the husband.", "NTA. It's pretty typical for a spouse of a stay-at-home parent to not realize just how exhausting it can be. Especially having a newborn. It seems like a lot of effort on top of everything but if you do it and he responds well, more power to you! Also, congratulations on your newest little one!", "info: is the slamming and overreacting typical? \n\nMaybe he's a jerk, maybe you're both exhausted with a newborn in the house and being snappy to each other. I'm not sure which from the post.", "NTA\n\nI would record everything then make it into the to-do list and have husband handle it for a few days, just so he can get a feel for it.
