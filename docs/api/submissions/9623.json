Like he'd insist he made more sacrifices than I did, and when I pointed out all the things I sacrificed for him, he came up with convoluted reasons why those things weren't \"real\" sacrifices. It didn't matter that he was, objectively, wrong. He still wouldn't change his mind, and continued behaving as if he was right. So there was no point to all my effort.\n\nYour husband isn't interested in fairness or truth. He wants you do do what he wants, when he wants it, without complaint. He is controlling and he's not just going to let go of that because you show him how much you do. He will just find ways to twist everything around so that you continue to look incompetent and he looks like the suffering martyr. \n\nI would advise you to see a therapist, ALONE, and figure out if this is a pattern in your relationship and how to undo the damage he is doing to your self-worth. And if he complains about you seeing a therapist (he almost certainly will), or refuses to do what's needed to support that (like maybe watching his own children for an hour or two), consider why he is so opposed to you taking care of yourself.

I don\u2019t want to say abuse because I don\u2019t know the exact dynamic of the relationship, but a man in his late 20s marrying and impregnating a barely adult girl is concerning as well.", "ESH.  Have a conversation.  Answering pettiness with pettiness is never really a good answer.", "NTA. Tell him to take a week off work and try to keep up with everything he expects you to do. See how far he gets.", "YWNBTA, but there's no point to it. There's a reason why he started dating you when you were so young and he was not. It's because he's an AH and thinks he can manipulate you because you're younger and less experienced than him. Doing your plan will not change that, he's still an AH. The fact that you're questioning whether you're the AH indicates it's working.", "Better yet, leave him at home all day with a baby and see how much he gets done.", "NTA, and this amazing! I love it.\n\nNo offense, but your husband is for sure TA though.\n\nAnd, if you don't do that, do what another commenter mentioned, and just take a baby and mom day and leave the house to your husband and see what he's got to say after that other than complaining more, would be my guess.", "NTA but... Why the extra effort?! Just stop until you can't stand it and want to do it. He'll notice real fast what you do. \n\nYou are 3 months post-partum. \n\nJust no!", "NTA\n\nAnother option: \"please, show me how it's done\"", "YWNBTA but your husband is totally being unfair and rude to get you to that point. I only baby site my nephews and I am shattered when I leave a few hours later. Doing that full time is how legends are made... You are legendary, you husband not.", "Don't forget to make time laps of your nightly breastfeeding too! That's a big part of you being exhausted, a part HE definitely doesn't provide.", "YWNBTA, but I do think you're missing what's happening: Husband appears to resent some aspect of his life, or believe he deserves better and he expects you to somehow make up for it. The problem isn't you, and it's not his expectations for you, it's that he doesn't actually appreciate what he has.\n\nThat's all of us, right? Really common stuff that people struggle with. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I know of many great ways out of this particular tunnel. Most people have to lose something, or at least get really close to losing something in order to wake up from that dream.\n\nAs with every relationship problem, your best best is open, honest communication that clearly states your position and rejects any notion that you deserve to be treated like some kind of freeloader.

Take care of just yourself and the baby.", "22 with 2 kids and a 30 yr old husband? How old when you met and got pregnant?? Because to my math, it sounds like a 27 year old got you pregnant when you were at least 19\u2026NTA.", "YWNBTA\n\nBut if you did this, would he care?", "Recording to prove yourself will not help. He will nitpick the video or just not watch it. You're NTA and wouldn't be regardless.\n\nYour husband sounds like my father while abusing my mother. It takes one thing to set off the layers and layers of criticism, insults, belittling remarks, tossing things around. It got worse and worse until they finally divorced when things became physical.\n\nYou are not valued by your character. He only values you to be his maid and child vessel.", "NTA\n\nGet him to take some days off of work and have him strap on the little kiddo while doing housework and see how he likes it.", "YWNBTA It's a great idea, and it could work.  OR if he's the AH I think he may be, he will just say you did extra that day to prove your point and it means nothing... cynical but probably true.", "NTA, and do it!", "DO IT! NTA", ">We didn\u2019t end up eating until 2.5 hours later and the food had to be remade.\n\nWhy?\n\nI would have eaten with gusto, with all the enthusiasm of a dramatic mukbang in front of his face.\n\nYou should record it but this is really just speaking of a lack of respect from him to you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but even video proof could easily be dismissed in a \u201cthat doesn\u2019t look that hard\u201d way. As a husband who formerly had a similar attitude, being left alone with a helpless kid and still having to do anything at all made me realize I had the much, much easier job. Let him get his hands dirty for a bit.", "YWNBTA\n\nBut he still won't get it.", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t need to justify yourself. He sounds like the AH. You have two tiny kids and are responsible for the cooking and cleaning as well? That\u2019s never ending, and if you\u2019re breastfeeding Baby on top of that all that\u2019s like a full time job right there- at least a 24/7 round-the-clock kind of job that you don\u2019t get breaks from. \n\nIf I was a mean person, I\u2019d advise you to leave both kids home with dad for the weekend (I know it isn\u2019t possible with baby who is nursing). Tell him he needs to cook, clean, play, do all the feedings (night time included), run errands, etc. \n\nThen when you come home from your weekend away, complain constantly to exhausted Dad about how nothing in the house is clean. I accidentally put my husband through this after our second baby was born. I was only gone 20 hours (I could pump so I was able to leave baby for a little while) for a medical procedure, but he was exhausted and traumatized from dealing with a two-month old and 2-year-old, making 3 meals a day, taking care of 2 dogs and trying to keep the house clean. Apparently taking 2-year-old big sis to her gymnastics class AND managing Baby in his carrier felt like preparing for an Antarctic expedition lol. \n\nI loved being a stay at home mom but most of the work we do is invisible. You can spend all day cleaning and the house still looks trashed when you have toddlers. A lot of the mothering happens after hours at night when our partners are sleeping. All those hours you put into nighttime nursing, snuggling sleepless kids, sitting up with sick kiddos\u2026 it\u2019s invisible unless our partner does it too. I hope your partner develops some empathy. Perhaps he needs to start helping more if he wants home to be cleaner. May I suggest a chore chart for both of you that more equally divides housework?", "NTA - Do it! He obviously does not understand. \n\nI'd also make a list of everything he would need to do if you didn't stay home and instead worked like he doe.   50% of daycare pickups/drop-offs, 50% of sick days when your child can't go, 50% of coming,  cleaning,  shopping.  The costs of daycare,  the costs of you getting to/ from a job,  the costs of you needing new clothes for a job.\n\nShow him how valuable your time is and everything that you do.", "Considering you recently made a post about hitting rock bottom, no, NTA. It would also be satisfying to go on strike and let him see everything you do each day, but then he might take it as justification to whine more.", "NTA, but I'm pretty sure showing him the video won't work.\n\nPosting the below in my continuing efforts to educate folks on how men are culturally indoctrinated to ***not*** perceive work that is beneath them as valuable or difficult; female-coded tasks like housekeeping and childcare are seen as beneath men, and so they minimize them. \n\n* This book shows you the scientific research proving how fathers leave childcare to mothers, and how society lets them get away with it: [**All the Rage: Mothers, Fathers, and the Myth of Equal Partnership**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CLLVZ52/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)\n* [She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes By The Sink](https://mustbethistalltoride.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/)\n* [It Took Divorce to Make My Marriage Equal](https://www.glamour.com/story/it-took-divorce-to-make-my-marriage-equal)\n* [You Should Have Asked](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) (scroll down a bit to see the comic)\n* [Women Aren't Nags\u2014We're Just Fed Up](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a12063822/emotional-labor-gender-equality/)\n* [The Housewife\u2019s Moment of Truth](https://nymag.com/news/features/46167/) by Jane O\u2019Reilly.
