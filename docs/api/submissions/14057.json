I turned 18 a few weeks ago and chose to move out of my dad's house. Things are not so good between us. When I was 7 and my brother was 6 we lost our mom. Dad moved on within a year of mom dying and moved stepmom in with us after 7 months. Right when that was about to happen he sat us down and told us he wanted to be able to make our home a happy one, that having pictures and mom's stuff around would make him sad, and would make his wife and her children unhappy and make them feel like they weren't welcome, and he wanted them to feel welcome, so he wanted us to be okay with giving all that stuff to our mom's parents. My brother cried and I asked if we couldn't keep some pictures. Dad told us he wanted us to get on board and wanted them gone for the sake of the new family. We gave in because we felt like we had no choice. My brother told dad it made him sad. Dad said he didn't want that but he did want us to be okay with it some day.\n\nWhen dad's wedding came up he said he wanted us to hold hands with our stepsiblings and he wanted us to present a united front as a family. I told him no way. He told me kids sometimes have to do stuff they don't want because their parents want them to do it and would make others happy. So we did that.\n\nThen he wanted us to stop talking about mom so much. Stepmom felt like we were trying to tell her she wasn't our new mom. Her kids felt like we were excluding them from stuff. He emphasized what he wanted a lot with that.\n\nA lot of stuff has come up where he wanted us to do something or change things. From being willing to babysit, to wanting me to do family trees with the \"current family\" instead of my actual family (meaning including mom but not including steps). He'd always go either firm or lay on a guilt trip. It meant my brother and I had a lot of hard feelings. Especially about pretending the stepfamily was a true nuclear family without missing people.\n\nWe are the only kids who didn't fully blend. Stepmom was step, stepsiblings were step, half siblings were half. Our stepsiblings call dad their dad, us their brothers and never ever said half. They even said they don't care if their bio dad ever gets mentioned because he's just a stranger who died. So we all did a bunch of family therapy to fix my brother and me and fix us all into the perfect nuclear family. It didn't work and my brother and I didn't suddenly feel like we were just a family. Dad didn't like it and when I moved out he was extra unhappy, especially because my brother wanted to move with me.\n\nHe wanted us to do therapy again and told me he didn't want me to be one of those kids who moved out right away. I told him I didn't need fixing and that he needs to accept he can't always get what he wants. Dad told me it's not all about the kids and I selfishly never wanted him to be happy and for us to have a new family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680705752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cmlx0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_dont_need_fixing_and_to/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He took away your memories of your mom and forced a new 'insta-family' on you.  He literally never listened to you and your brother saying that you weren't happy with all this. \n\nYour dad is the asshole here.", "NTA\n\nYour father is trying to weaponize his very specific choice of \"therapy\" as a way of forcing you into the box that he feels that you should fit into. \"Therapy,\" in his eyes, is likely trying to get a professional to tell you to \"shut up and color\" in the situation at hand. \n\nWith that said, I would encourage you to look into actual therapy - of your own accord, personal, not involving anyone else - as I do think there are some things that your dad did and said that would be very beneficial for you to talk through with a professional. \n\nThat doesn't mean that I think you're broken. I just mean that it is readily apparent to me that your dad was mentally abusive, and that I think taking care of your mental health is very important. I understand that may not be well received (as I completely get that you have a bad taste in your mouth currently, as far as therapy is concerned), but I do feel the need to state as much. You have to be the champion for your own mental health (no one else will do that for you), and that can have a very large bearing on your overall quality of life. \n\nApologies if this hits wrong, I meant no offense by it. Wish you the absolute best of luck.", "NTA. Wow your father is the master of guilt tripping and gaslighting.", "NTA. But your father is an AH. He has no respect for your feelings.", "NTA\n\nYou are right and your dad is wrong.\n\nYou can't \"fix\" people into being someone else.", "NTA, but what is up with your dad with guilttripping you and your sibling for a decade?!? No wonder you don't feel part of the family.. It's about time dad starts to learn that.", "NTA\n\nYour dad forcing your mom out of your life was wrong. His guit trips were wrong. Stepmom support the behavior from your dad was wrong. Your and your brothers whole life were made to force you to give dad and stepmom the best life. They had no reguard to your feelings of loosing, what I can only assume, was a wonderful mother. I'm sorry they didn't acknowledge your feelings of hurt and pain. Maybe if they had, your relationship with them would be much different. You're not obligated to make him feel anyway. He has a lot of repairing to do between you and your brother. Maybe you and brother should get thereapy, just the two of you, to help you finally heal properly the loss of your mother.", "NTA. I'm sorry you dad is sick an AH.\n\nI how that you can get therapy, not family therapy to accept the BS that your dad is peddling, but therapy for you to come to terms with an emotionally abusive father. Because forcing a child to give up the memories of a decreased parent and assimilate into a new family is abusive.", "NTA your father is a selfish failure of a human being. You and your brother deserve to move out ASAP. Hope you can get back your mom's things from your grandparents, and start expanding your chosen family.", "NTA. He has been (and is being) so cruel to you and your brother. You should be proud of yourself and your strength for getting yourself out of that house.", "I'm sorry. Sometimes the greatest cruelties are presented in the name of kindness. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Your father is pathetic,  taking away your time for grieving is horrible.\n\nIt's good you're moving out from that toxic person, he has no respect for you or your brother.  You two need to get out and just start living your lives the way you want to", "NTA\n\nYour dad is TA here. \n\nI'm sorry you lost your mother. Your dad should have supported you and your brother. \n\nIt's not for us to judge how quickly your dad moved on as grief affects everyone differently. But, he chose to then ignore that your mom ever existed which is so very cruel. No one could ever replace your mom and your dad is wrong to try and force that mother/kid relationship with your step mother. \n\nYour step mother is also denying her own eldest children from remembering their father which makes her an AH too.\n\nInstead of encouraging a healthy relationship with your step mom, your dad ended up pushing you away. \n\nYour dad needs therapy as to why he thought it was okay to forget his first wife and force his kids to try and forget her too. \n\nHopefully you have a more peaceful home life now that you live with your grandparents and I hope your brother makes it out too.", "NTA. Your dad is being really selfish. I am sorry you have to deal with this..", "Easily NTA\n\nYour father basically wants to erase your mother in favor of his new wife and kids. That\u2019s wrong. Now that you\u2019ve moved out, I hope you can go to your mom\u2019s family and get some of her memorabilia back.", "NTA at all.\n\nThe entire world feels like it shifts when you lose someone central to your life.\n\nYour dad's way of dealing with your mother's passing seems to have been to hyperfocus on rebuilding what he lost (a marriage/family).\n\nIn the process of doing that, he failed to give you or your brother the time and space to rebuild your worlds. He can't force that and never should have tried.\n\nI'm sorry you and your brother had to go through losing your mother at all. I can only imagine how it felt to also lose those reminders of her too.", "How can a father do that to his children, for that 'perfect family' really? He seems to forget your mother passed away and he tried to make you two forget her, what a shame, what a disrespect. Under what right and authority?? What he did all these years is unacceptable and it's time to punish him. Continue living with your mother's parents, I'm sure it gives them comfort to have their daughter's son on their side.

Naaah. He's got his happy family- you go build yours, and if you have kids, remember to treat them as people with feelings and relationships that are deeply important to them, not just extensions of yourself whose only purpose is to make you comfortable and happy.\n\nHow DARE he make his own kids' grief for their mpther an attack on him, as if only his feelings mattered! I'm sorry he never made you the valued human priorities you deserved to be. \"It's not all about the kids\" my left patootie- none of it was EVER for you or about you in his eyes.

What some parents who remarry after loss don\u2019t realize is that adding a new family member doesn\u2019t mean forgetting or replacing a dead one. It just means adding more people to love. Like when you have another child, it doesn\u2019t mean you stop loving your older children. Your moms memory doesn\u2019t disappear just because your dad remarried. They could have incorporated your moms memory into their new lives, and it would have been better for everyone. If she had been willing to sit down with you, and talk about your mom and listen to your memories, instead of trying to erase them, you probably would have loved her for that alone. I say this as a widow with a young son. Your dad and step mom handled this in the worst possible way. They put their insecurities above a child\u2019s grief.", "NTA.\n\nYour father is a horrible man and a horrible father.

I say no to that bs\n\n>Dad told me it's not all about the kids and I selfishly never wanted him to he happy and for us to have a family\n\nActually it IS and should he about the kids and like I said above, he wants you and your brother to sacrifice YOUR happiness for the sake of his. He also wants to try to erase the memories and relationship y\u2019all had with y\u2019all late mother by trying to force his new family into y\u2019all life and trying to force a relationship; this is what causes kids to hate their step-mom/dad and/or step-siblings", "NTA get your brother out and cut the rest off.", "NTA.

There's no forced facade. Nobody is pretending like the past didn't happen or even rewriting the past.

I was very uneasy in making that recommendation (especially with your negative past experience), but I also know from my own personal experience that you don't want to wait until you're well into your thirties (or beyond) to start addressing things like that.

Until then, keep healing and enjoy your life without his toxicity.", "Even with my family all being my full family, I still felt the same way. Honestly, I still feel the same way.\n\nBest guess: our moms were the biggest part of what we defined as family and home.\n\nLuckily, I can also tell you that as you build your own life your sense of family and home can come back.
