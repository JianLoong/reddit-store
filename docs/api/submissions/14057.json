I turned 18 a few weeks ago and chose to move out of my dad's house. Things are not so good between us. When I was 7 and my brother was 6 we lost our mom. Dad moved on within a year of mom dying and moved stepmom in with us after 7 months. Right when that was about to happen he sat us down and told us he wanted to be able to make our home a happy one, that having pictures and mom's stuff around would make him sad, and would make his wife and her children unhappy and make them feel like they weren't welcome, and he wanted them to feel welcome, so he wanted us to be okay with giving all that stuff to our mom's parents. My brother cried and I asked if we couldn't keep some pictures. Dad told us he wanted us to get on board and wanted them gone for the sake of the new family. We gave in because we felt like we had no choice. My brother told dad it made him sad. Dad said he didn't want that but he did want us to be okay with it some day.\n\nWhen dad's wedding came up he said he wanted us to hold hands with our stepsiblings and he wanted us to present a united front as a family. I told him no way. He told me kids sometimes have to do stuff they don't want because their parents want them to do it and would make others happy. So we did that.\n\nThen he wanted us to stop talking about mom so much. Stepmom felt like we were trying to tell her she wasn't our new mom. Her kids felt like we were excluding them from stuff. He emphasized what he wanted a lot with that.\n\nA lot of stuff has come up where he wanted us to do something or change things. From being willing to babysit, to wanting me to do family trees with the \"current family\" instead of my actual family (meaning including mom but not including steps). He'd always go either firm or lay on a guilt trip. It meant my brother and I had a lot of hard feelings. Especially about pretending the stepfamily was a true nuclear family without missing people.\n\nWe are the only kids who didn't fully blend. Stepmom was step, stepsiblings were step, half siblings were half. Our stepsiblings call dad their dad, us their brothers and never ever said half. They even said they don't care if their bio dad ever gets mentioned because he's just a stranger who died. So we all did a bunch of family therapy to fix my brother and me and fix us all into the perfect nuclear family. It didn't work and my brother and I didn't suddenly feel like we were just a family. Dad didn't like it and when I moved out he was extra unhappy, especially because my brother wanted to move with me.\n\nHe wanted us to do therapy again and told me he didn't want me to be one of those kids who moved out right away. I told him I didn't need fixing and that he needs to accept he can't always get what he wants. Dad told me it's not all about the kids and I selfishly never wanted him to be happy and for us to have a new family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680705752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cmlx0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_dont_need_fixing_and_to/", "score": 1979, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just mean that it is readily apparent to me that your dad was mentally abusive, and that I think taking care of your mental health is very important. I understand that may not be well received (as I completely get that you have a bad taste in your mouth currently, as far as therapy is concerned), but I do feel the need to state as much. You have to be the champion for your own mental health (no one else will do that for you), and that can have a very large bearing on your overall quality of life. \n\nApologies if this hits wrong, I meant no offense by it.

No wonder you don't feel part of the family.. It's about time dad starts to learn that.", "NTA\n\nYour dad forcing your mom out of your life was wrong. His guit trips were wrong. Stepmom support the behavior from your dad was wrong. Your and your brothers whole life were made to force you to give dad and stepmom the best life.

Maybe if they had, your relationship with them would be much different. You're not obligated to make him feel anyway. He has a lot of repairing to do between you and your brother.

They could have incorporated your moms memory into their new lives, and it would have been better for everyone. If she had been willing to sit down with you, and talk about your mom and listen to your memories, instead of trying to erase them, you probably would have loved her for that alone.
