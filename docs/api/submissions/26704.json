My (f37) brother Anthony (m41) and I have kept an overall good relationship with each other as adults. We would hang out at my parents house often and have a great time and, with time, so would our respective partners. However, 13 years ago, our family dynamics changed drastically, when A met his now wife Diane (f39).\n\nI noticed on the very first day I met her, that D seemed very insecure, clingy and a bit rude and demanding, but I figured she might just be really nervous, and I was certain that if we just made her feel at home, the issues would resolve themselves. Sadly, I was wrong. For the last 13 years, my SIL has run the show. She will throw major unprovoked fits, acting both entitled and demanding, and she\u2019ll tell my brother that she will leave him, if we don\u2019t do things her way or she gets what she wants. She will be disrespectful in the most cruel and hurtful ways towards my brother and us all. It doesn\u2019t matter what the occasion is or who the guests are - she will ruined it. This pattern emerged very early on in their relationship and to my surprise, A has taken her side ever since trying to keep her around. As a result every single get together, birthday and holiday has been miserable since they met. Now they have 3 boys (m8, m6 & m6), and SIL has made it her mission to primarily bond my nephews with her family, bluntly telling me: \u201cA\u2019s family is not MY family\u201d, and therefore she did not need any of us. \n\nThrough this, I\u2019ve stayed kind, welcoming and loving. I\u2019ll never give up on the boys or my brother, but I do try to protect myself as well, so I\u2019ve taken a step back. I\u2019ve learned to live with the situation the best I can - however, recently my SIL and A have started to act like I\u2019m an AH for stepping back a bit. It started when me and my hubby had our firstborn (f4): all of a sudden, they began acting like we should hang out more, be the best of friends etc., although none of their behavior has changed. Our daughter has autism and she finds it extremely difficult being with my brother\u2019s family and honestly, so do we. The last time we saw them in our home was on our daughter\u2019s birthday, where they completely ruined the day. Our daughter was heartbroken and so was I. So I swore to still see them, be kind etc, but not in our home and not as often. I will ask them to go to outings, do stuff with the kids and such, but I will no have my child feel unsafe and heartbroken in her house.

You have drawn boundaries to protect both you and your child and they are reasonable as you are still trying to preserve some relationship but keep your home be a sanctuary away from the disruptive influence of that person. It is the best you can do with the cards you were dealt, in my opinion and you are already showing as much more tolerant and understanding than the source of the issues.", "NTA. They're very fortunate that you're prepared to see them at all.", "NTA at all. As your daughters parents you have every right to shield her from such toxic behavior as well as protect your own mental health, especially in your own private space.", "NTA! Good for you to put some boundaries in place to protect your peace. The people who hate boundaries are the ones who need them most. Stay strong!", "NTA - We went through a similar scenario with my BIL and his new wife.  We are now no contact for the last five years as it became just too much.  Prior to that that had not been to our home for I would say ten years?  We choose to keep our home as our safe space, and those who come in need to respect that, they could not so we stopped inviting them over.", "Why even asking for outings etc?

If A and D want more time with you nowadays they can issue a few invitations and host a few events themselves. It sounds like you did not only the emotional labor but the physical planning for many years to maintain a certain type of relationship with your brother and his family. Now they feel aggrieved that your priorities have changed.", "NTA", "NTA. You are doing what you need to do for your family. Especially your daughter. My daughter is also diagnosed with Autism, so I know how it can affect interactions with people if everyone is on their best behavior and things are said unintentionally!\n\nI would have a talk with your brother and explain things. Tell him you love him and will always be there for him. But your primary focus needs to be on **your** family and you can't do things that will hurt your child. I'd try and do things with your brother by himself and give him space to vent if that's what he needs to do. You do you and keep your family safe and sane!", "NTA\nSounds like your brother is in an abusive relationship and there is nothing you can do about that. But you can protect your child from her so don't let them in your home again.", "YTA for keeping these ghastly people in your life. You say SIL ruins every social event yet you keep attending them, getting together, trying to be \"kind.\"\n\nJust because you're related doesn't mean you have to know them.", "You're absolutely doing the right thing. Your daughter is your priority and no one, repeat no one should be allowed to abuse her and that includes ruining her birthday. At the very least,  I'd consider not letting them participate in outings when she's included. You may want to express your concerns privately to your brother and let him know that should he decide to leave, you'll be there for him but be aware that it may not go over well. NTA", "Thank you for your kind words!\n\nUnfortunately, I am certain that my brother would cut ties with his family if anyone of us voiced our concerns, so until now I have begged my parents to keep their feelings to themselves, as I am certain they will lose their son and grandkids over this if they dare to say anything. MY SIL even said this herself not too long ago. \n\nMy parents are elderly and I feel so bad for them that these are the last years of memories they will have with their son and grandkids. It just breaks my heart for them. So I\u2019m not sure how much longer I myself can go on before I\u2019ll have to talk to my brother about it privately. I really don\u2019t want to risk losing him or my 3 nephews, but I will if it makes my parents less misserable.\n\nA & D have made us all feel like we\u2019re the AHs for years, so I guess even standing up for myself, my family and child feels horrible and shameful.", "Thank you!", "Just to clarify, I don\u2019t always bring my daughter on the outings, as I try to shield her whenever possible. At the same time, I also try very hard to be there for my nephews, as I know their mom will tell them \u201cI don\u2019t care about them as I should\u201d. So sometimes I take them out. When my daughter is up for it, we all go. \n\nAlso, my daughter has high functioning autism, and some outings are ok for her, as long as she (and we!) are very well prepared and everything is structured and thought out. We will do our very best to pick a place where she can have fun and potentially withdraw from my brother\u2019s family when needed, or if she needs our help to self regulate emotions.", "Off topic: your parents should draw their will to exclude the partners of their children. That way anything your brother one day inherits won't be split in a future divorce.", "Makes sense, you\u2019re doing a balancing act of sorts. \n\nI said that bc I also have \u201chigh functioning\u201d autism, and if someone ruined my birthday and was generally chaotic/loud to hang out with I wouldn\u2019t want to see them even in types of outings I would generally like. Might just be me though, you know your daughter better", "Thankfully, my patents have done this. My SIL absolutely lost it when she found out, and she had my brother promise to share his inheritance with her or she\u2019d leave him. There is still a lot of bad blood over this from her side, but I\u2019m glad they did it and I\u2019ll make sure my parents wishes are honored.", "Maybe that inheritance should go into a trust for the grandkids and you and your husband can be executors of the trust.\n\nYou're a better person that I am. I would've cut them out years ago.", "I agree.  \nLeave the money to only the kids ensuring that she can\u2019t touch it.", "NTA\n\nIts freeing when you realize you don\u2019t actually have to put up with any of that. I realize he is family but is it worth consant stress for you and especially your child when you could go no contact and have some peace. You don\u2019t have to put up with them and for the sake of your child I hope you don\u2019t", "I need the tea on what they did at the birthday.", "Well in that case they should leave it all to you and then let you disperse the money to your nephews as needed."]}
