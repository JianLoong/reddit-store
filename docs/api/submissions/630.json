I have depression and anxiety that I\u2019m dealing with as well. \n\nI haven\u2019t expressed my anger yet - seems consensus is to not. I have been super supportive of his mental health as I suffer along with him. He just lost all his motivation, knowing that he had a family to support. \n\nI am not telling anyone because I don\u2019t want to cause him to lose face with our family and friends.

He could have called his doctor to talk about changing his treatment plan, he could have changed jobs if the one he had wasn't a good fit. Could you have made alternate plans together if continuing to work was untenable?", "NTA.  You don't get to go golfing while your wife supports your kids and works nights.", "I don't understand the people who are calling you the asshole here. Yes your husband has a mental health problem but according to your words he is under doctor's care. This is a full grown man who had been given several chances by his boss. It was your husbands responsibility to do something but instead he proceeded to do nothing and let his entire family end up in this situation.\n\nMental health is difficult but he blew all chances to do something in the wind. You are allowed to be angry and yes you are allowed to express it in a reasonable manner.\n\nAnd you should really consider talking to your husband because I don't know if I could be with someone who ruins their entire family.\n\nNTA", "NTA for **feeling** angry and resentful. In fact, it would be crazy if you were **not** upset that he has put your whole family at risk.\n\nYou would only be the AH if you acted on that anger. Right now he needs support to get him back on track mentally and jobwise.\n\nBut it is okay for you to feel your feelings. Take care of yourself; you are carrying a lot of weight right now.\n\nAlso, do not describe yourself as a SAHM. It sounds like you homeschool your kids and working part time as an online tutor. You are a working parent.", "If he is the main provider and the main person to actually worry about bills then you have no idea the pressure he is under. I get it your worried about bills too but the pressure of \u201cwe rely on his salary\u201d is just piling it on more. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s well aware he\u2019s the main bread winner without you having to point it out. I\u2019m sure he already feels terribly and already feeling absolutely horrible for losing his job and blaming him for something he can\u2019t control is an AH move. You being a sufferer of depression should be more understanding. You have no idea what is going on truly in his head and it could be scary and gloat far worse than yours seeing as the pressure is mostly on him to provide for the family.", "It sounds like your husband is suffering from depression, and it's likely what is behind his lack of drive, ambition, interest in life.  Depression, untreated, can end a person's life.  Please....the last thing he needs right now is to feel your anger and disappointment in him.  Trust me, he already feels plenty of disappointment in himself.  You need to get him to his doctor, asap.  He needs your love and your support right now, more than ever.  Nothing is worth dying for, and all the issues and concerns your mentioned can all be figured out.  I am very concerned for his well-being, just by what you have described as changes in behaviors that are unlike him.\n\nI lost my husband to depression, over 20 yrs ago.  I never saw it coming, believing that was the last thing that he'd be capable of.  I was wrong.  Life as I knew it....as our kids knew it....forever changed on that day.  Part of my heart and soul went with him, and I still suffer flashbacks and grief that will never go away.\n\nI wish you and your husband best wishes in turning this difficult situation around.  Our loved ones are all that really matter, in the larger picture of life.", "NTA - You are allowed to feel your feelings and express them in a respectable manner. You can't just blow up on him and vent about everything, but a suggestion would be trying therapy for yourself and in a group session with your husband so you can both express your feelings in a safe environment with a moderator to help guide you. \n\nI struggle with depression and anxiety, and I spend most of my days off not getting out of bed. However, that doesn't give me any right to not go to work, to not care for other people, or to let my family down financially. Yes, depression sucks and if left untreated can cause someone to spiral, but that doesn't mean that you just give in. I hope that you are able to support him in any way that he needs and that in turn, he is able to get back on track with a new job and start dealing with his depression in a somewhat healthy manner.", "YTA - If your kids are school age then get a job while they're at work. Depression is fucking hard to deal with and even harder with no support. Instead of helping with the stress you rag on him that he can't lose his job while you stay home? Not cool. Imagine the pressure the poor guy is under, having crippling depression and on top of it having to worry about his entire family is he can't stay strong enough to fight through his mental illness.", "YTA.\n\nYour husband has an untreated illness. He  may be under a doctor's care but the treatment or lack of treatment is not helping.  He expressed depression and stress many times and then did what a lot of people with depression do, he gave up. Would you be pissed if he had cancer and lost his job?\n\nAs for what to do, apply for employment to start. Encourage him to seek help in whatever way he needs (therapy, medication etc) outside of what his doctor is currently doing.  Apply for benefits if need be. Down size your home, cars etc. Apply for help with Christmas.", "YTA. I can guarantee that he's FULLY aware of the situation ya'll are in. You adding to it is going to make it so much worse. I've depression myself and the number one thing that clouds my mine is whatever negative situation I'm in at the moment. It's hard and regardless of being surrounded by people it feels like a one person fight.", "Ok...so at this point YTA if you attack your husband. What happened happened, whether it's due to his depression or just being an idiot, and he's looking for other jobs trying to fix it. Piling on at this point does nothing but strain your marriage even more. Wait until he gets a job and then tackle the issue with a couples therapist. Oh and make sure you look into the healthcare.gov marketplace. In states that expanded medicaid you could be eligible for free health insurance if you have no or low monthly income right now.", "Sorry but if you have \u201cdepression and anxiety I\u2019m also dealing with\u201d you wouldn\u2019t be angry knowing damn well it\u2019s something YOU CANNOT CONTROL. You\u2019re totally the asshole.", "Yta. He supported you by working so you could be a sahm. He can't work right now due to illness, so you should support him by working. Be a team.", "Yta.

Would he be able to parent/homeschool (or enroll in regular school) while you make better income than your part time tutoring pay?  \nBeing the only income for a family of 6 has to be a major stressor.  Let him take a break, he can work part time, maybe in the gig economy or something where he has control, while you support the family for once.", "YTA because you still asked for judgement after typing the first paragraph", "YTA.", "NTA. I would be angry as hell at him. He can't control the depression but he can control how he responds to it. If you haven't already I think you should sit down with him to make plans for a huge change in your family's life. Tell him you need to review the rate of savings depletion and what to do when those are gone for place to live, food and clothing expenses, transportation expenses, insurance expenses. Ask him to help you figure out the following:\n\nShould you sell your house or simply default on the mortgage and lose what you have already invested in it? Remember that will affect your credit score and make a variety of things more expensive to you over the next few years. Can you move in with family members? If you are a regular reader of AITA you know that is always temporary and leads to a breakdown of family relationships even if it starts with good intentions and goodwill. Will moving change your children's schools and friends?\n\nHow much will you need for groceries and clothes and school expenses? There are likely some places to cut costs though he and your kids won't like some of the measures. Thrift stores, food pantries, food stamps, etc.\n\nYour transportation expenses have been small if you both worked from home, but it's not always easy to find WFH jobs with benefits. Are you still paying off a car? If so, can you keep the payments up or should you try to sell it and take the loss to stop the ongoing payments? Can you afford gas and insurance for a poorer car? If you don't have a car, it's harder to reduce other kinds of costs (like where you shop, how you get to the doctor).\n\nWhat cheaper alternatives do you have for medical insurance? Unfortunately cheaper alternatives will increase immediate costs and may make it harder for him to get mental health services.\n\nAt what point will you need to ask help from family, and what can you realistically ask of them? It will certainly change your relationships.\n\nPart of the reason I laid this out is that once the two of you have looked at your prospects, nothing you could say would be more expressive of how betrayed you feel and how much he has hurt your family.  It takes far more effort to climb out of such a hole than to avoid slipping into it, but he is way past that point. Next step will be family breakup if he cannot respond to this.", "Yeah your kinda the AH for saying this. As someone who had such a deep depression I was hospitalized for 14 days even thou I was \u201cunder the care of a doctor\u201d when you are in that deep of a hole and life is not worth doing anything about anymore then it\u2019s easy to be where he is. The OP has no idea how severely her husband is suffering on the inside. He could be on the brink of suicide and she couldn\u2019t know. Her acting like this is all his fault for a illness that cannot be controlled is just an AH move and not a very understanding wife. When I came out of the hospital and couldn\u2019t contribute did my husband act like this woman? Hell no. He was super understanding and stepping up when I couldn\u2019t. Be a team mate.", "The OP said in the first paragraph that he\u2019s under a doctor\u2019s care.", "Mhm.\n\nAn \"I told you so\" is basically an executive way to make sure you'll zero out your savings before anything ever happens.", "If he lost his job due to cancer we would have a lawsuit on our hands. I don\u2019t treat mental health lightly - but you really can\u2019t use depression as a reason for wrongful termination", "She's clearly not angry she's stressed and scared.  There's a difference.  They have kids to take care of and its all falling on her.  This isn't an AH or not situation this is a life sucks situation.", "Thank you. I love him and I hate to see him suffering but sometimes I\u2019m so angry because I could see it happening - honestly it\u2019s the best  example of the classic \u201cI told you so\u201d but you\u2019re right. Doing that would cause only more stress and harm. Thanks for the advice.", "I work nights and take care of my kids during the day, also homeschooling the older ones.", "I do work - at nights when my kids are asleep. I homeschool the older ones and the others are still babies.", "My point was that he has an illness. An illness that often expresses itself in the ways that caused him to lose his job. And BTW, if you are in the U.S. you can absolutely be fired for having cancer (or any other illness). Being ill is not protected. Being mentally ill is not protected. There is FMLA, unpaid leave and some limited leave in some states. That's it. \n\nHave you looked for employment? He has expressed stress and depression for quite some time and it seems like you are concerned that he works. Not that he gets better. Not that he focuses on his health. That he provides for you.", "Please find a healthy way to let anger out though. Built up anger can make you physically ill as well as cause depression. Also if it keeps building up you might say something you regret in a heated moment. Hope it all works out soon. I can relate to the situation, even if details differ.", "Can he not be the stay at home parent now seeing as he\u2019s suffering right now far worse than you are? You\u2019ve been lucky enough to be at home. Maybe it\u2019s his turn and your turn to be the breadwinner. You may appreciate what he\u2019s going though even more once you fully understand the pressure he is under. Because until that happens you cannot possibly understand what he is going through"]}
