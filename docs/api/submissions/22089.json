I\u2019d post a photo of her on insta stories and be like when you wear white lace to a wedding and have to change into the sweats of shame and tag her ass", "Only if, instead of \"Juicy\" across the ass they said \"~~Bride~~\".", "Right!! Amazing", "This made me laugh out loud", "Omg, lmfao selling these shirts would make a killing! So many MILs and moms, etc, trying to wear white to weddings would just be shut down with shame so quickly. \ud83e\udd23", "Love this! All brides should have a shirt like that just in case.  If the person wearing white fusses about changing, they gotta wear the shirt or leave! \ud83e\udd23", "Ok - thank you for explaining :-) I think now I understand the hullabaloo.. \n\nFor me - a wedding is ALWAYS about the family, but now I understand why all the focus / attention / need of hour is that one person .. \nWhere I\u2019m from, no one will care if 20 women showed up in the same colour dress as the bride because everyone knows she is the bride and no one can take that away from her, but if the focus is on one person and not on the event itself, then what you\u2019re saying makes sense.\n\nThank you for your patience and for explaining this \ud83e\udd70", "Nta That's a pretty common rule to not wear white at a wedding unless you're the bride.", "NTA.. neither of those outfits are appropriate for a wedding.. and she knows this.. in laws also massive AH\u2019s", "NTA, honestly you wouldn't have been the AH if you had kicked them out for violating the dress code. the gall to show up in sweatpants and flip-flops!", "NTA \n\nSorry you went through this OP. It's definitely not fair!", "YTA.  So long as she's not wearing a wedding dress.  Total AH.", "Calling all brides reading this post. Delegate!!! Identify at least two people, one man and one woman, to deal with any issues the day of your wedding. They should be delegated to handle it, and not even tell you about it until after the honeymoon. Woman wearing lacy white dress to wedding? Bounced out. Woman back wearing sweatpants and flippies? Bounced out. A bouncer does not get angry, excited, or argue. He calmly tells you to leave, and will assist by lifting you by the elbows, if needed. Problem with the catering? Handled. Wedding ring mislaid? Found or a temporary replacement taken from the nearest lady\u2019s hand. \n\nBrides, you need emotionally well regulated delegates who will smoothly handle whatever drama arises, and then you need to enjoy marrying the spouse of your dreams. Have the mindset that you do not, and will not, care about whatever petty things occur. Doesn\u2019t matter. Insignificant to you. \n\nThat woman is not treating you like family. Fine. Talk to her about the weather like she\u2019s a complete stranger at a party when you see her. Her opinions are insignificant in the trajectory of your life.", "No only the bride in white..", "I would have kicked her sweatpant-covered ass out. Imagine showing up to a wedding wearing that!", "The rule on black seems to be going away as so many cocktail outfits are black.  It seems to be black is OK as long as it doesn't look like you are in mourning, and white is OK only as accents.  Like a white shirt with a dark suit, or a dress that has a white background but is a colorful print.\n\nThe idea being don't look like you are trying to outshine the bride, and don't look like you are grieving.", "I\u2019ve heard of making a \u201cjacket of shame\u201d at the bridal shower for anyone who shows up in white to the wedding. Makes it so everyone gets the memo before the wedding that wearing white will yield an ugly jacket wearing at the event. \ud83d\ude02", "I think the slogan should be \"I tried to outshine the bride\" just so it includes the nightmare women who opt for colours that aren't white but have the same intention.\n\nYou're a genius with just the right level of petty that tells me we could be friends and cause chaos wherever we went!", "But make it a white shirt with white lettering that has a black border. They still get to wear white! Just not in the way they wanted \ud83d\ude02", "Sure thing! Its definitely a culturally specific thing - and American wedding culture has gotten pretty intense over the last 20-30 years as well, so it's always in flux.", "YNTA.\nAnyone with an ounce of common sense knows that you don\u2019t wear a white dress to a wedding if you\u2019re a guest.\nShe sounds like a complete narcissist and is upset because she didn\u2019t get the attention she wanted.", "NTA.  Damn, your husband\u2019s godmom is petty AF.", "I\u2019m going against the grain, ESH. Obviously it\u2019s rude to wear a white, lace gown to someone\u2019s wedding. However, telling someone to change their clothes is also rude. Seriously, no one is going to mistake godmom for the bride. Your wedding isn\u2019t ruined because of the way a guest dresses. If at the end of the day you are married, then your wedding was a success. \n\nMy husband\u2019s Aunt wore a t-shirt, capri leggings, and flip flops to our wedding. Was she underdressed? Yes. Did it ruin my wedding? No. People really need to get over themselves and stop making these small issues into big issues that will not matter in the long run. OP should\u2019ve just kept her mouth shut, let godmom wear the dress, and let the rest of the guests gossip.", "NTA! She shouldn\u2019t have tried to wear white to YOUR WEDDING", "NTA - I don't give two damns about wedding stuff; but even I know that you 100% don't wear white to a wedding as a guest. \n\nWhere the hell do all these people come from who don't know about this?", "Sweats and flip flops are completely inappropriate for a wedding. So is wearing a white lace dress", "How pathetic can someone be?", "We aren't discussing that.", "INFO: Was she wearing a dress that someone might have confused for the bride?  Or would it be obvious to anyone looking at her that she was not the bride?", "no, the in-laws are the asshole", "NTA. The woman is almost a sitcom caricature of unhinged egocentrism and my condolences that you'll be condemned to tolerate her until one of you dies."]}
