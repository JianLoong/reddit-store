A wedding in the family is a big event for the whole family - why is the entire \u201cattention\u201d just about the bride (not even the groom from what Iv read in these posts).. Parents wait their entire parental life to celebrate the wedding of their kids. So what two people wore the same colour? It\u2019s just a colour. \nDoesn\u2019t the bride already know she is the bride?", "That's just not how it works in American culture. Americans are very individualistic - the wedding is about the couple, and yes, the bride (because of gendered expectations around weddings). Attention can be swapped out for \"focus/priority/etc\" and its all the same intent. You're hyperfocusing on one word and missing the bigger picture. \n\nAmerican weddings are not about the family - that's more of a communal culture thing. Again, I don't necessarily ascribe to this but it is a very strict etiquette rule that is both implicit and explicit. You don't wear white to a wedding. It's like wearing hot pink to a traditional funeral - it isn't done because it's not about the guest - it's about the person at the front of the ceremony."]}
