Don't trust him not to fall back into his old ways, but it shouldn't be what you're reacting to if he's not doing anything now, if you see what I mean.

It seems like Max was purposely rude to you, multiple times. You would be the AH to yourself, if you stayed with your boyfriend and he didn't acknowledge that you deserved an apology and doesn't force you to hang out with the brother until he changes his ways. I do not think this means the brother must not hang out with him, but it must not be at the expense of your comfortability. This is just his brother, what happens if you breathe wrong and offend his mother?\nYou say that your boyfriend doesn't see it....show it to him. Anytime a snotty comment is made, look at him and say babe, Mary just said I force you to diet do you feel that way? And ask him right in front of , huge smile on your face... your boyfriend gets mad, he should be equally as mad that somebody is trying to embarrass you. My boyfriend and I recently encountered a situation similar to this and we took that opportunity to make the other person look like a fool. We laughed, joked and carried on our own little moment. You could tell that the a****** had never felt so small. LOL", "NTA but your boyfriend is for turning a blind eye and not speaking up for you when you get bullied.", "NTA\n\nBut sounds like your BF needs to do more to back you up on this. Assuming all of this happened, your BF needs to open his eyes and see that his brother has treated you terribly. There's a difference between someone perhaps not being as talkative and it taking time for others to get to know them, and being downright rude, criticising someone (behind their backs), acting like others (in this case you) don't exist etc.\n\nThe brother seems like a nasty person who has been trying to sabotage your relationship and who also treats you poorly. I would expect your BF to be able to see this and acknowledge his brother's bad behaviour and have a real good talk with his brother about this and/or realise that brother isn't someone he wants in his life if he continues to treat you so poorly (and never even apologised).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's understandable that you don't want to be around someone who consistently treats you poorly.

I\u2019m in a similar situation with my sister who has treated me poorly low key and lied about me regularly to my parents for decades.

I understand Max hasn\u2019t had it easy but all I ever tried to do was be supportive and friendly and was met with this attack.

Plus it was meant to be a date for me and bf. Bf was not happy I didn\u2019t want to go with them and we consequently had to find a new display to watch the fireworks to avoid running into them. Caused a huge argument where bf said it\u2019s all in my head and I should just get over it.

But the behaviour continued for years. I don\u2019t need Max to like me, while it would be nice, it\u2019s bf\u2019s affections I care about. \n\nI just need to know if I\u2019m an asshole for not letting go of this behaviour and not wanting to be around Max unless it\u2019s a crowded family event.", "If you don't mind being confrontational for once, the next time Max treats you like crap, just tell him to his face \"I don't know why you've treated me so horribly from the moment we were introduced to each other. You know I am not your ex, right?! I didn't hurt you, and not all women are the same. You need to stop treating me like shit if you care about your brother: I am with him and your nasty behaviour towards me is pushing me and him away from you.\" I would only do this if at least your bf (and possibly other people) are around just in case he gets very angry. I would also do this when you are ready to leave the house so ensure you have your own transport. Alternatively you can message Max this.\n\nI honestly feel that your bf should stick up for you. If your brother continues to let this BS slide, I would reconsider the relationship. He doesn't have to kick Max out of his life but he should stick up for you and try to get Max to see that he's treating you unfairly and that this is also affecting the relationship between Max and your bf, not just the relationship between Max and you.", "Max is holding you accountable for his ex and your boyfriend is letting him. You're not reading too much into it.", "It's not alright but cheating isn't that rare.

It sounds like he isn't going to support you in any situation where there is a conflict with Max.\n\nI would suggest that you reconsider the engagement with your boyfriend, you can't marry into a family which is actively hostile to you.", "You can\u2019t pretend the past didn\u2019t happen but you can accept that it happened in the way it did for whatever reason & nothing you do will ever change that.\n\nLots of people start out not liking each other. Eventually they grow to be more mature & respectful towards each other so they don\u2019t negatively impact other people around them. Lots of people start out liking each other & then decide they don\u2019t really enjoy having that person in their life. \n\nThere is another thing you & Max have in common\u2026. You both love your bf & want the very best for him. That\u2019s one good reason to be polite to each other. \n\nWish you all the best!", "I found this post to be way too one sided. Either OP is only giving half the story or she truly has no idea why Max doesnt like her. Either way, it\u2019s not enough to judge.", "In no way do you have to be around someone who's treated you so badly. Max shows no signs of remorse or regret, hasn't apologised, and seemingly hasn't changed his way. I would try to interact with him the least amount possible.", "You dont have to be around anyone you dont want to - Im just still curious why Max doesn\u2019t like you. Does he claim to have legit reasons for why he is rude and cold to you?", "He was in a facility for about a month, during time in the facility he attempted again. Took a few months off work and started dating again pretty quickly, bought a new expensive car and sued his cheating ex for emotional distress/financial reasons", "Thank you, that\u2019s the plan. After enough responses I\u2019ll be showing bf. Hoping this puts an end to the discussion on this situation", "He says I was \u2018holding bf back\u2019 \u2018not good for him\u2019 and was \u2018too quiet\u2019 but on times I would try to talk to him I would be met with yes no answers. Max and me never had one conversation in the first 2 years of us dating.", "Respectfully, I think showing him this is a bad idea. You dont need internet strangers telling you what to do. You, your bf, and Max need to figure out why your relationship has been strained and understand that."]}
