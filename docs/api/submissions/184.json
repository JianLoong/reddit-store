There\u2019s a difference between the compulsive cleaning your mother engaged in and asking someone to clean literal cat piss off the carpet. It\u2019s ridiculous you even have to ask.", "WBNTA for that however rule of thumb with cats, you need one litter box per cat plus one! That's probably why her cat peeing outside of the litter box", "YANTA it is completely normal to want a clean environment and it would be good for you to bring it up to your roommate so they can correct this, tbh though if I was you I would definitely talk more about training the cat or considering other options  if that doesn\u2019t work out because you should not be responsible or suffering because of someone else\u2019s animal.", "Nta- keeping your place clean is a very bare minimum request. Especially with pets.", "NTA. As someone who has a clean freak for a husband but grew up in (what I now know was) a pig sty\u2026 that is disgusting. Her cat is being territorial. That\u2019s why he is doing EVERYTHING.\n\nHow did you introduce them? Even if you did it well, her cat is more aggressive/dominate than yours. I see that in my 2 cats as well.\n\nWe had a stray outside our apartment that tried to claim our apartment by spraying outside ours and 1 of our 2 female cats was spraying inside marking her territory and it was obnoxious. It got to the point where we now have all walls covered up with SOMETHING unless there is a window so she has nowhere to mark. That cat is now gone but she can still smell the marks so still pees in those spots.\nWe have 2 litter boxes and I was cleaning them daily at one point.\n\nAll this to say, she needs to grow up and deal with her cat or get it out of the apartment because that is cruel to the cat. The cat is living on edge trying to say \u201cthis is my litter box/apartment\u201d to your cat or other cats outside and that is not a healthy way to live.\n\nNot healthy for her either. Hurts her mental health the more she lives in a place like that and risks her physical health.\n\nDefinitely NTA for asking her to clean litter and pee off the carpet regardless of where it is\u2026. ESPECIALLY since YOU pay damage fees. If there are any, I would charge her for them. Tell her if she doesn\u2019t clean, she will pay all damage fees. Regardless of whether her cat caused the issue.", "YWBTA. It's nice that you care about the cat, but as long as your roommate pays her share and her room don't become an health hazard for everyone, I don't think you have a right to tell her to clean more. It's HER room, so she keeps it the way she wants it. Instead I think you can insist on the chores, those must be divided equally, if she doesn't have time to do it, get paid to do it instead of her if you like to clean.\nAlso, if the cat lived with her before this situation, he might be used to her mess. I'm not a cat behaviorist, but maybe the cat has other problems (or it could even have been your cat peeing outside, because he was uncomfortable when the other one was around, and stopped while he was alone).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're right that it is both not your space/problem, but it also affects you and the rest of the house in the long term. I think YWNBTA for gently talking with her about it and maybe suggesting solutions that are more collaborative (having litter cleaning time of the week where you both do it together, vet check up to make sure this isn't from a health issue, looking into creative solutions for containing messy cat litter). It is technically her right to do with her cat what she pleases, but it is your right to say that's not acceptable behavior for a roommate. It sounds like she might just need some extra support. \n\nAs a side note, the other poster is right- you need 3 litter boxes for a house of two cats!", "i just feel weird because it\u2019s in her bedroom not our common space but i would still have to pay any damage fees", "I was thinking this too.

While that cat was here our cats were literally fighting\u2026 hissing and all.
