Like if it's baby furniture, for example. She needs to get it herself instead of expecting them to do it. And college fund will be a big deal later.", "Thanks. That definitely should have been in her original story.", "Yeah but OP could have simply said she thought it unlikely the family would be offering financial support to her and left it at that, she wouldn't have been an AH (to me anyways) if she'd done that.. But she went on with the \"because you're not married. Even though I'm not married either, I'm different and they won't treat your baby as good as they do mine.\" That was super assholey.", "Yeah I'll agree with that. The relationships aren't equal, but that's not the point.", "Yea, she is the asshe but what are these plans of hers that the in laws need to pay for? With that knowledge I am going with everyone sucks here.\nOP for thinking she is all that and some chips and Daniel's girlfriend for acting entitled to other people money.", "NTA. You gave her a much needed reality check, especially if she\u2019s banking on financial assistance that won\u2019t come because of their well known position on these things.", "YTA. You literally said they treated your kid fine. You're literally acting like some kind of god holier than thou..", "I'm a little disgusted by all these plans Alissa has for her child using the father's family's money like it's her money to burn through.", "YTA! To me, the way you speak about it, it seems like your boasting about how your child is being treated.\n\nYou\u2019re not being a \u201cfriend\u201d you\u2019re being an ass and trying to sugarcoat it.", "Yta", "You are stating the facts as you see them but this a discussion she should be having with the father, not you.  A soft YTA for not leaving it up to the cousin to break the news or at least continuing the argument after she wanted to hold onto her dreams/delusions.", "Being poly and having an open relationship are two separate things.", "Except in comments she states her cousin is engaged to someone else and in an open relationship. So baby is, from a traditional point of view, an affair baby.", "Not only that but I guess Daniel is in an open relationship and refuses to marry Alissa because he is already engaged so the plot just thickened a bit.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship. So I highly doubt she is jealous. Just being honest if anything.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "She is trying to help her friend who is dependent on money she probably will never see because her baby daddy is engaged to a different woman and they have an open relationship.", "Sounds like she got pregnant FOR the family money.", "But Alissa will never marry into the family Daniel is already engaged to another woman and got her pregnant through an open relationship and refuses to marry her. I find that info important.", "Supposedly they are having a baby together but are not together from what I gather. There is no plans for them to get married from what it looks like.", "I read down the top comment and replies to that for a bit, it's a good way to get more info", "I agree. If my kid was going to be treated poorly I'd like to know what to expect up front so I could manage Mine and the child's expectations.\n\nAlso so I could limit or encourage time spent with people accordingly. Primary grandparents and cousin groups etc.", "Tf are you going on about. Did someone hurt your widdle feelwings today?", "Nope, I'm fine.... You? I mean trying to start something with some stranger on the internet with baby talk would be a much bigger indicator of your day, not mine.", "OP- a lot of your comments/replies should be added to your post. I think a lot of Y T As would change if they were getting details on others you have observed and the relationship of the cousin and person you warned. Too much info that is helpful and very relevant is buried and missing from your post.", "NTA, def should update your post with the info in the comments. \n\nTLDR: Her monogamous relationship baby.\n            \n            Her friends the mistress of a man in a open relationship who is engaged to someone else, baby.\n\n            The olds will old over that alone. Shes right to warn her friend.", "INFO: Why are you still fighting?  It seems like this is potentially relevant info to pass to her, but once it's passed, what else is there to fight about?    \n\n\nIf she's upset, have you apologized for inserting yourself unnecessarily?  If you're right, she'll find out eventually and you've done your duty to warn her.  Let her disregard that if she wants.", "You are the asshole.\n\nNot only was it not your place to tell her but what were you hoping to achieve by telling her and possibly creating drama? \n\nYou have no guarantee of how that child will be e treated, it also almost comes off as you hoping the kid will be treated badly so yours will remain the only \"special illegitimate\ud83d\ude44 snowflake\".\n\nBack off and mind your business.", "So your child is special cause you were out or wedlock but you suffer from main character syndrome and you are exempted from you own arbitrary judgment? That\u2019s a big old YTA, and a bigoted one as well, well done.", "YTA and you\u2019d best stand up for her baby", "NAH\n\nImho you tried giving her the insider info. I think your mistake is perhaps you\u2019re not the person to deliver this info. Would you and her be close enough for this to come from you? Is Daniel willing to get engaged? Otherwise, what\u2019s the use of telling her the info other than worry about emotional pregnant woman over something she can\u2019t control?\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 could talk to Daniel, idk. I just think you meant well but maybe you\u2019re the last person to talk about it with her given it worked out for you. Or you have to be clearer about how you\u2019re trying to help here, cause it is not helping clearly.\n\nAnd stop arguing when you see you\u2019re not helping. You don\u2019t need to push her away too, poor thing.\n\nDo you have a wedding date? Everyone assuming you\u2019re a hypocrite, when your fianc\u00e9 could end the engagement and you\u2019d be in the same boat.", "NTA. I read this as you trying to warn a friend about your in-laws behavior (which you apparently have seen 3 times already). It's tricky as yourself had a baby out of wedlock, but under a context your elders could shift in a more acceptable way (long term family friend + engaged to son).  I don't think you're a hypocrite as I know about this type of family dynamic of your in-laws (aka you can't really argue with so much stubbornness, & judgement). It's always easier to shoot the messenger...", "NTA.", "YTA. Omg let it go.", "She isnt acting anything, she is just telling a pregnant woman not to plan her whole entire life on money she is probably never gonna see the shadow of. Op is engaged while that girl is an affair partner, if family is that old fashionned it makes absolute sense that they might not give her money. And it is actually getting urgent that she finds out how her child is going to get treated and that she is financially going to be pretty much on her own.  it makes sense that OP would tell her.\n\nNTA", "If they are a conservative religious family, there is a huge chance that it is a huge family. Heck, my grandparents had 11 kids, they all went and had multiple kids each, I had 20+ cousins on 1 side growing up, we mostly all have a few kids now as well. We don't treat kids out of wedlock any different, but man is there many in my generation that have multiple kids out of wedlock (20+ years together and never married, multiple kids from different partners, you name it).

It\u2019s not insignificant to the story.", "You forget when she said she knew then her hole life, looks like she is already family to the IL", ">Not quite true.  There are some societies that have \"legitimization\" through marriage after the fact/birth."]}
