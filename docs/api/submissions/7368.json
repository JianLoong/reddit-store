It comes off as if you yourself are potentially shunning her child and gloating that yours isn\u2019t. \n\nSo even though you meant well it was an overstep. You should not have said anything. You were far better off waiting until after the child was being treated unfairly and your friend mentioned it to explain your concerns instead of giving her a hurtful and worrisome warning based on speculation.

And we for all we know OP wedding was delayed BC they were pregnant. Or planning phase pushed back bc ya know, OP gave birth and is healing and raising a child? So yea it is different for OP to be engaged already, plus OP has known them their whole lives. It sounds like she gets a \u201cpass\u201d due to circumstances, and the parents/family feel like it\u2019s More of a sure thing. \n\nOP is NTA for popping her friend\u2019s vision of grandeur. Her friends situation is completely different and unfortunately will have her treated differently. It sounds like Alissa Baby Daddy comes from money since Alissa is so ready for her child to have access to it. She needs to know and to revise her plan for this child.", "OP and the baby's father are engaged. The father of the friend's baby is *engaged to someone else*, not the friend. So, that's a big difference.", "I would also agree with this statement because the pregnant friend is planning things for her unborn daughter life that require funding from the baby daddies family.  I\u2019m guess it means past the level of child support.", "Ain\u2019t that the truth.", "Hole life made me laugh inappropriately", "There is now no legal distinction between children born within and outside marriage in Scotland. However, years ago, children in Scotland were legitimised when their parents got married.  \n\n\nWhen we researched the family tree, we discovered that the registration of one family member's birth had a note attached two years later to say that the birth had been subsequently legitimised by the parents' marriage and the marriage date was added to the register.  (Can't remember the exact year, but it was during WW1.)", "While that is true, it doesn\u2019t often hold up to older conservative parents in my experience here in the Bible Belt.", "No being is engaged is preparing/expecting to marry. It is not marriage therefore a child born to that union is still out of wedlock. No difference.", "Been \u201cengaged\u201d a long time, apparently.", "The \"string of bastard children\" aren't picturing them as anything. They're children. All they see is that their grandparents treat them differently than their cousins, for reasons completely beyond their control. \n\nThere's no mention of them treating their grown ass adult son differently for his *choice* to have kids out of wedlock.", "Yes, there are a few more restrictions to that law(ie both parents had to be free to marry at the time.  So the baby couldn't be an affair baby per se). English court case Munro vs Munro case(mid 1800s) dealt with this.  The court case dealt with residency which would determine legitimacy/inheritance.\n\nIf one goes back even further in time, being betrothed inferred a certain status to the couple.", "It's a hell of a lot closer than the friend not even being in a relationship with her baby daddy...", "To normal people yes\n\nTo old fashioned people, there is a difference. People got legitimised if their parents married after they were born all the time.\n\nThe question here isn't \"is the family the ah for being old fashioned?\"\n\nThe question is \"is op the ah for warning her friend that the family is old fashioned\"? \"", "\ud83d\ude44", "Real thoughtful comment there..."]}
