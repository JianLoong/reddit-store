I can only imagine how she behaves when the two of you disagree.", "100% NTA for refusing to go to the wedding with your wife dressed like that. But it seems like these issues are deeper than just a dress. Your wife doesn\u2019t get along with the bride, fights with bridesmaids, is excluded from participating in wedding rituals like dress shopping etc. probably due to her volatile behavior, and even goes as far as to sabotage the wedding on purpose. Your drinking sounds like you\u2019re trying to cope with her acting this way and that\u2019s not healthy for you or the relationship. I think a serious talk about y\u2019alls marriage is long overdue.", "Bruh get OUT OF THERE. NTA.", "NTA. You deserve some type of medal for living through that.

Getting dead drunk was not the best response to the situation, but you were not wrong when you disagreed with your wife.", "NTA - This is straight forward, the bride and stepson confirms it.", "NTA.
