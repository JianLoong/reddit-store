But it seems like these issues are deeper than just a dress. Your wife doesn\u2019t get along with the bride, fights with bridesmaids, is excluded from participating in wedding rituals like dress shopping etc. probably due to her volatile behavior, and even goes as far as to sabotage the wedding on purpose.
