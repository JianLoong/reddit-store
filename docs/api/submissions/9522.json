People who are mad at you about your storytelling can go sit in syrup", "NTA whatsoever. I lost my right eye back in the late 90's. Folks can be inquisitive idiots sometimes. I also went the route of telling folks different stories every time. One is that I was shot by a sniper while peacekeeping in former Yugoslavia (right down to the Mythbusters sniper shooting through a rifle scope bit). One time, on a flight the person next to me asked about it. I had a window seat, and told them I volunteered for experimental surgery and the eye was bionic, had infra red, telescopic vision and such. I looked out the window, we were flying over Winnipeg and I excitedly stated \"oh look, there's a car accident at Portage and Main.\" One thing we used to do at my old workshop was a bit mean, but it was typical army humour. If a new guy came to work with us, one of the other techs would say \"go ask Ibmeister about his eye\", and when they did I'd put my hand over it, whimpered out an \"I don't wand to talk about it!\" and scurry away. There's tons of ways you can put them on the spot if need be. If they tell you you're an asshole, I usually respond with \"you could have kept your trap shut.\" The easiest and most workable of all is \"what happened to your eye?\" followed by \"what happened to your manners?\"", "NTA and if you're looking for new stories to tell people, my grandfather used to tell us he lost his fighting the native Americans with General Custer", "NTA- I can't imagine why someone would ask more questions after being told \"cancer\", definitely rude af", "NTA.  \n\nA few years ago I needed a cane due to a mysterious ailment that still hasn\u2019t been diagnosed.  The number of strangers who felt entitled me with questions about how and why\u2026 and when I couldn\u2019t answer their questions, would make guesses.  It was painful because the doctors had no idea what was happening, I was really scared and I didn\u2019t want to talk about it.   I can\u2019t imagine how much harder that would be when they\u2019re asking you to lay bare one of the (I assume) scariest times in your life.\n\nA real conversation:\n\nThem: What happened to you?!\n\nMe: I\u2019m not sure.  It\u2019s\u2026\n\nThem: Did you fall?\n\nMe: No, nothing reall happened, my joints just hurt.\n\nThem: What do the doctors say?\n\nMe: They\u2019re still looking into it.

One year ago, my friend's husband died from a seizure due to epilepsy and now she is a 30-yo widow. Since the moment he passed people have had the audacity to ask her how he died. His unexpected death was very traumatizing for her and the family. She has three children, two of which are adopted, so it comes up often when filling out paperwork or even when she's just out with the kids. My widowed friend is a counselor, so she's well trained in sitting through awkward silences. So that's what she does. When people ask her how her husband died, she doesn't say anything. This makes people very uncomfortable and they usually apologize. \n\nOP, your feelings are valid. They likely have no idea how it feels to have something about themselves pointed out or asked about. Unfortunately people are like this everywhere. I don't know if duping these people will give you satisfaction forever, though. My husband gets asked where he's really from quite often. His father is Japanese, but my husband was born and raised in South Carolina. He started making up where he's from when they didn't believe he was from South Carolina, but it didn't give my husband any relief from duping people. He just continued being annoyed until he found a different way to communicate with these kinds of people. \n\nUnfortunately, you'll probably have to deal with this your whole life. I think it could be a good exercise in professionally expressing your boundaries. It's okay to tell people that what they're asking is too personal. It's okay to not respond at all. It might help them realize that they are crossing boundaries with their questions and to give you control over your personal space.", "NTA.
