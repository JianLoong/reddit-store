I\u2019ve not really cared about questions, but then again, I literally never had an arm. There\u2019s no accident or tragic event that happened. But I always think about what if I had an ultra traumatic experience, and they dredged up bad memories? There\u2019s often little consideration it seems before people ask, which is slightly concerning.

My mom got tired of explaining it, so she told people it was a skiing accident...so many people were shocked they taught children as young as 6 months old to ski (This was in 1975).

He got tired of trying to explain that to the guy on the barstool next to him so he started asking them if they had seen those blue deodorant pucks they put in urinals.  When they confirmed they had, he would proudly exclaim \"I make those!\" He reported that it never failed to impress!", "NAH.\n\nIt's your life, and I understand answering the question hundreds of times can get tiresome.

It's not like anyone would come across a person with one eye and act like that's completely normal.\n\nMaybe you can just be brief and blunt?

I hate how people constantly interrogate disabled people or treat them as spectacles. You don't owe anyone shit.", "NTA. In fact you are doing community service by making some of these people realize they are the asshole by asking.\n\nI once as an older teen asked a guy holding a baby with a cast what happened to the child.
