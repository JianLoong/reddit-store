I made her cupcakes, helped make my boys super hero/villain costumes for it, and put up with her pointing out every little time I hadn\u2019t pulled through for her and her husband leading up to it. \n\nI also got a small windfall of money and spent most of it on helping my mom get her a sewing machine before handing her a couple extra hundred dollars she needed that I was expecting to be handed back at some point. That was the last time I think we spoke before she asked me to house sit her cats the week after while her and her husband were gone. I really wish I had said no, but I didn\u2019t.\n\n\r  \nAt the time my sister was renting a furnished trailer that had a MASSIVE television mounted in the living room. Sometime over the course of that weekend it broke and because my kids were in her house for a fraction of a minute she blamed my youngest for breaking it because at one point when he was much younger he had thrown something at a TV and cracked the screen despite her having two rambunctious cats there at the time that climb on everything. \n\nShe wanted us to pay to replace it, or to just give her money and so she could buy one at Walmart with that money later. We begged to come and look at it, but were lied to and told it was taken away. My aunt repeatedly tried to give her a replacement but refused any route besides money. She did let my dad look at it but even he says there was no way my kid was in the house long enough to even get near the TV, let alone break it. She also lied through about three more iterations of stories that she claims was \u201cto protect us\u201d since her landlord/boss was furious and banned us from the property, something we weren\u2019t even told until after they moved out. \n\n\r  \nMy sister is convinced that my husband is going to yell at her for all of this, despite the last time she showed up at our house she was the one screaming her face off at me for not letting her see her boys and not understanding that she was trying to do the right thing by perpetually lying to us. Lying is something my husband and I cannot stand, something she should know very well, and I still do not trust that I can leave my kids alone with her without an extortion attempt being thrown in my face. \n\nAccording to our mother, my sister wants us to COMPLETELY forget the incident and never bring it or anything tied to it up again. Ever. Am I the asshole for wanting an actual apology (literally just muttering the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d does not cut it for me) before letting her back in to our life? Because part of me really doesn't want to after all this, even if she is my sister. At this point it isn\u2019t much of a deal as she refuses to talk to us at all but I know my parents took my kids to the same place my sister and brother-in-law were for Thanksgiving and also lied to us about it, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to confront them about that yet.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1701312875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1877wfn/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_apologize_after/", "score": 357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't let her back into your life even with an apology. She lied and extorted you multiple times, and can't even muster up the gumption to *pretend* to be sorry.

They never went near the TV.", "NTA\nI would be more concerned about the parents that the sister, it's creepy they lied about where your children where.", "NTA She lied about your kids, tried to extort you. Why would you even accept an apology if she offered one, but as she wont even do that, sod her", "NTA, but I would let this go and cut contact with your sister. Your  parents no longer get to have your children unsupervised. No apology from your sister would be sincere. Why bother trying to force one? It wouldn't meant anything. Don't \"confront\" your parents. Calmly let them know about no more unsupervised visits. No discussion, no argument. Tell your parents if they drag other family members into this or argue with you they won't see your kids at all. Your decisions are final.", "NTA. But you need to go no contact with your sister. She is toxic and manipulative and can't stop lying.  No good comes from interacting with her.  For your own mental health, you need to stay away from her.  \n\nShe's not going to apologize, so write her off.", "I'm confused. NTA.  But your sister sounds like she needs mental help.  If your parents cannot be trusted to respect your wishes, then unfortunately they should be limited access with no contact with sister.", "I can't do any sort of judgment until I know how the TV was broken. Was there a big crack in the middle of it like someone threw something at it? Did it fall off the wall and land on the floor? Did just randomly decide to no longer turn on anymore? Because I have rambunctious cats. And rambunctious cats cannot make a TV Break by throwing something at it. So if it looks like something had been thrown at it and your child had a history of doing that then it's reasonable for her to assume that your child or some other human did something to the tv. But the TV randomly fell off the wall or just decided to not work then your sister is crazy.", "NTA", "NTA. She lies and tries to get money from you.

She described a back light going out to me, I went back and double checked our texts from that day,  but my dad said there was a spot in the front that looked like something could have hit it. According to him, I think it was next to the bar top that came out from the wall right beside the TV a few inches from the bottom, and the spot was under the height of the bar.  If something hit it, it could have easily been the cats knocking something off, but nothing she said to us indicated that kind damage. I had to drag what I did out of my dad and when confronted with both dad and I in the room last December, she flip-flopped between stories the whole time.", "Sister wouldn\u2019t let even op SEE the supposed damage and rejected any avenue for restitution that didn\u2019t involve money so I would say that it would be safe to assume NTA.", "And remember, somebody who apologizes for lying - that apology is probably a lie, too.", "NTA.
