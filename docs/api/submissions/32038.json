I made her cupcakes, helped make my boys super hero/villain costumes for it, and put up with her pointing out every little time I hadn\u2019t pulled through for her and her husband leading up to it. \n\nI also got a small windfall of money and spent most of it on helping my mom get her a sewing machine before handing her a couple extra hundred dollars she needed that I was expecting to be handed back at some point. That was the last time I think we spoke before she asked me to house sit her cats the week after while her and her husband were gone. I really wish I had said no, but I didn\u2019t.\n\n\r  \nAt the time my sister was renting a furnished trailer that had a MASSIVE television mounted in the living room. Sometime over the course of that weekend it broke and because my kids were in her house for a fraction of a minute she blamed my youngest for breaking it because at one point when he was much younger he had thrown something at a TV and cracked the screen despite her having two rambunctious cats there at the time that climb on everything. \n\nShe wanted us to pay to replace it, or to just give her money and so she could buy one at Walmart with that money later. We begged to come and look at it, but were lied to and told it was taken away. My aunt repeatedly tried to give her a replacement but refused any route besides money. She did let my dad look at it but even he says there was no way my kid was in the house long enough to even get near the TV, let alone break it. She also lied through about three more iterations of stories that she claims was \u201cto protect us\u201d since her landlord/boss was furious and banned us from the property, something we weren\u2019t even told until after they moved out. \n\n\r  \nMy sister is convinced that my husband is going to yell at her for all of this, despite the last time she showed up at our house she was the one screaming her face off at me for not letting her see her boys and not understanding that she was trying to do the right thing by perpetually lying to us. Lying is something my husband and I cannot stand, something she should know very well, and I still do not trust that I can leave my kids alone with her without an extortion attempt being thrown in my face. \n\nAccording to our mother, my sister wants us to COMPLETELY forget the incident and never bring it or anything tied to it up again. Ever. Am I the asshole for wanting an actual apology (literally just muttering the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d does not cut it for me) before letting her back in to our life? Because part of me really doesn't want to after all this, even if she is my sister. At this point it isn\u2019t much of a deal as she refuses to talk to us at all but I know my parents took my kids to the same place my sister and brother-in-law were for Thanksgiving and also lied to us about it, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to confront them about that yet.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1701312875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1877wfn/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_apologize_after/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't let her back into your life even with an apology. She lied and extorted you multiple times, and can't even muster up the gumption to *pretend* to be sorry. She tried to pin her own negligence *on your children*. She is not trustworthy, and seems like a deeply unpleasant person in general.
