I had my tonsils removed at age 30 because of this problem.

You can be smell blind to your own smells even if you're not actually smell blind otherwise.  \n\nHad a friend like this in high school, we called it the beast, made jokes about it behind his back but we were too worried to tell him to his face until like a year later when it was mostly cleared up.  \n\nI get him being defensive in the moment but you're just telling the truth - he should go to a doc., figure out what's causing it because there are plenty of things that could be from sinus infections to acid reflux et al.", "NTA but yeah there is a sort of smell blindness.   If you are experiencing persistent non-life-threatening stimuli for long enough your brain will tune it out.  I experienced this as a child.  I lived in a trailer with usually 20+ cats all not spayed or neutered, and that place smelled to high heaven of piss.

He might have felt insulted because he felt like you were attacking his hygiene but the reality is there are a lot of health issues that consistent bad breath could be associated with.

If that (and flossing) don't help THEN he should consult a doctor", "The thing to remember is his dental hygiene could be top-tier, and he could still have bad breath.\n\nThose with very bad breath usually have other causes that aren't solved by tooth brushing. flossing, tongue scraping, et al.", "AND....BRUSH YOUR TONGUE ! That's where most of the smelly bacteria \ud83e\udda0 is!", "It\u2019s also a godsend for us teacher who work with middle schoolers.

If not he probably has literal rotting food particles in his mouth.", "NTA.\n\nYou've done him a big favour, if only he could realise it.

OP\u2019s friend may need an oral antifungal to get it cleared up.", "Hoarders often get nose blind, or people living in filth, often smokers and pot smokers alike are totally blind to the smell they create or carry on them.

Next, see his family doctor, and then possibly a stomach doctor.", "a friend came to work with really bad breath one day, I was the only one that told her and said she needed to see a doctor today. She had a tumour at the back of her nose and with immediate surgery and chemo she is still around thank goodness.
