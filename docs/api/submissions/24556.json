Does he floss? Scrape his tongue? People overall are not attracted to bad breath (I sure as hell am not) and if he refuses to improve on that then I don't know what you should tell him. Wanting him to be successful at dating and letting him know of his halitosis problem is a bro move. You did everything you could and if he wont listen then he should be ready for more rejection moving forward.", "NTA. Even if he brushes his teeth, he might have dry mouth, or he might not be properly brushing/scraping his tongue, or there could be a lot of other reasons why his breath stinks. He lashed out because he's embarrassed, but he now has an opportunity to try and figure out what's up.", "People do have smell blindness to their own breath (and poop, farts, and BO) and it can stink without them even realizing it.  Chronic halitosis is something he needs to see a doc about, and you're NTA for telling him because he needed to know.", "He may be offended, but hopefully he'll settle into accepting your advice.  NTA, he asked for an opinion", "NTA\n\nHe asked you to be honest. It  also can be  a sign  of some illness, so he should take  care of his dental hygiene more.", "NTA.      \n\nIt's ridiculous when people don't accept constructive criticism. Unsolicited advice is one thing but when somebody is constantly sniveling about something obvious it's annoying as well.", "Maybe he has tonsiloths. Those things stink something nasty. NTA", "NTA. He may be upset now but if it helps him he will thank you.", "I mean, if you straight up said 'your breath smells like shit ' that's pretty brutal. It's good to be honest with your friends but you can do it in a way that's as respectful as possible.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like he was totally and utterly oblivious to his breath scent and strength!\n\nI would very compassionately suggest he sees a dentist asap. He might have tooth decay, gum desease or just never have been taught proper dental care or perhaps his technique is outdated - the dentists these days say to brush all your mouth including tongue and inside cheeks etc, when I was a kid it was just brush your teeth!", "Some people can have medical conditions that make their breath bad and the person who has it can get used to it to the point where it isn\u2019t noticeable to the sufferer.  NAH.  You did the true friend thing of tactfully telling him the truth.  I hope he sees a doc for this bc it is treatable.", "NTA show the guy this thread. if you brush your teeth and use mouthwash and im assuming you dont eat literal shit, go to a dentist and ask them about it. could be a number of things causing it. honestly treat this as a symptom and make sure there isnt anything wrong with your throat/tonsils. could end up saving your life [throat cancer/mouth cancer can present as bad breath]", "Nta but it could be some dental or medical problems he has that causes his breath to stink. And does he brush his teeth with toothpaste or just water cause that could be a thing too. Other than all this, you had to be honest otherwise he was never gonna get it with all the subtle hints you given him with gum and mint", "NTA because he asked. There are many conditions that cause bad breath. He needs to see a dentist and/or a dentist.", "NTA.   Chronic halitosis can have a whole series of medical reasons behind it. Not just poor oral care either.  Seriously, he should start a really strict hygiene regimen for his mouth and if that doesn't help things he needs to see a doctor pronto", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you can't count on your friends to be honest... You can't really smell your own breath. There isn't really a way to tell. I used to work with a guy who had the worst breath, because he had somehow gotten a stomach parasite. It's probably not his fault, and he should probably go to a doctor", "Did you literally say it smelled like shit?\n\nYes he asked and yes honesty is important but how you relayed this information is key.", "NTA. He likely has a health condition causing it. TV show Ted Lasso had a storyline about this and the girl had bad breath due to taking antihistamines.  Ask yourself, would you want to be told if the situation was reversed? Yes! Give your friend some time to get over his knee jerk defensiveness. He'll appreciate you for this later.", "NAH. You\u2019re being honest with him, and this advice you\u2019re giving him will maybe help him in the long run if he takes it. Some news is just very hard to take regardless of how gently it\u2019s delivered, though, so I can also understand why he\u2019s upset. Hopefully, once he has a little time to think about it, he\u2019ll realize you were coming from a good place?", "NTA - if he's brushing his teeth and doing all the normal oral hygiene then he needs a doctor or dentist because there's something deeper. When I was 4, my breath was so bad my mother would gag if I hugged her. FOUR. She brought me to the doctor and sure enough, I needed my adenoids out. It may not necessarily be anything he is or isn't doing. It may be out of his control. I think you should suggest he see a medical professional - dentist is probably best.", "Yeah, OP. If you get too used to a smell, you can become \"nose blind\" to it.", " Listen he need to see a doctor cause it is a medical condition and can be treated by a dentist.. the thing is general we all get use to smell\u2026 so he may genuinely think he breath smell but doesn\u2019t.. give him this evening and then try again to talk to him tomorrow.. tell him it is not about brushing teeth but he need to go to a dentist and get his mouth check..", "NTA \n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed this consistently for half a decade, he has a problem. \n\nI\u2019m surprised a dentist or doctor hasn\u2019t mentioned it.", "NTA\n\nBut in this case several gastric related medical conditions can cause such issues and he probably never realized it. Usually the person in question can\u2019t smell it.", "NTA\n\nmy partner gets a bad breath faster then others and I tell him when it happends. Better me than someone else.\n\nWe always have gum in the car or in our bag. \nNot his fault, just bad luck.\nAnd there are mouthwaters that can help keep breathe fresh longer\n\nYou are a good friend, I think.", "NTA \n\nour brains literally process odors differently depending whether we are inhaling or exhaling, so he may really bot know. the guy likely has health issues if his breath has been consistently bad that whole time despite brushing/flossing etc.\n\nyou\u2019re not a doctor but you don\u2019t need to be one to diagnose \u201cbad breath.\u201d i hope he gets medical attention and learns that he should be grateful to you rather than angry.", "Doesn't even have to be a tooth-issue. He could have stomach problems, or - as others have suggested - tonsil stones.   \nI had a friend who, every time they sneezed, smelled like literal shit. Turned out to be chronic sinusitis.  \n/u/Tiny_Buyer6180 - you're definitely NTA. If your friend is willing to listen to you again, advise him to visit a doctor, since chronic halitosis is a medical red flag.", "Well, some things are just never nice to hear, constructive or not. Chances are he'll get over his initial upset and it'll all be fine. But nobody is gonna take being told they smell/their breath smells well at first even if they did ask for honesty. That kinda shit stings.", "NTA. I agree, it could be tonsil stones. You can find videos on YouTube showing their removal. They smell SO BAD.  I had my tonsils removed at age 30 because of this problem. You could maybe share that with him, explain that it could be more than simple brushing, and it's nothing to be ashamed of, he can fix it if he addresses the issue with a dentist and a doctor, to chase down the cause!", "I assume you mean tonsillitis?

However, if it is clear that you are coming from a positive place then getting butt hurt is just immature.", "Tonsiloths are hard nuggets of bacteria food and dead white blood cells that get stuck in the crevices of tonsils and they stink bad.", "I reckon most people get butthurt in these situations because it gets them in the pride, but most are better at hiding it.", "It's \"tonsillolith\" but yes, they can cause bad breath. As can drying medications, H. pylori, and other diseases. Worth getting checked out. \n\n(And OP, if you feel like dropping any other hard truths, this fella might want to know that if someone offers you gum or mints, best to assume they're doing so for a reason.)", "This.\n\nNever refuse a mint or gum if it's offered to you.\\* This is an especially important social interaction for neurodivergent people to learn and get comfortable with. \n\n\\*unless you have an allergy, medical, or sensory reason for not being able to have that specific item. In which case, you should carry your own, and \"Thanks, I've got my own\" and pop one in your mouth."]}
