Prior to attending I saw that my ex boyfriend (24m) was also invited since my friend is dating his cousin.\n\nMy relationship with my ex was one of the worst experiences of my life. He was extremely toxic, borderline abusive and made me feel the worst l've ever felt.\n\nFast forward to the party, I figured his presence wasn't enough of a reason for me to miss it because a lot of my high school friends that I haven't seen in for a while were attending as well, so I got there with my mind set to ignore his presence. That was working and the party was going well, but he was getting drunker and drunker by the hour. The more he drank the more he pestered me, interrupting every conversation was having to talk about me in a demeaning manner. I kept my cool and continued on ignoring him, tho eventually I lost it.\n\nA friend was asking me about my degree (I'm majoring in media communication with a minor in political science) and my ex interrupted by loudly asking \"What's that degree good for\nUnemployment?\"\n\nI decided enough was enough and I just blurted out \"Well what about yours? Nevermind you are the only person in this room without one. Matter of fact, what makes think you are apt to talk about degrees when you dropped out of high school when math started having letters in it?\".\n\nHe then said something about how he was working as a personal trainer and that he might not be the smartest in the room but he sure was the fittest, to which I replied that that wasn't so hard because he was also the shortest so assumed he had a lesser amount of muscle to tone. I went on to sarcastically congratulating him on picking such a lasting career as I was sure in 16 years everyone would want a 40 y.o personal trainer. He stormed out and as he was leaving I jokingly said that with a profession with such a high pay he could totally afford to retire at 40 anyway so he definitely did the right thing by dropping out of high school just one year in.\n\nHe didn't bother me for the rest of the night and I ended up having the best time, not thinking of even talking about this exchange. However, his cousin (the hostess boyfriend) has been texting me over and over saying that because I was sober and he was drunk I should've taken the higher road and that I was wrong for exposing him the way I did. He also said that several people who were there that night agree with him, but no one has told me that personally.\n\nI think I was simply standing up for myself because, after all, he spent the entire night trying to humiliate me and I was just the one who ended up being successful with that \u201aso, am I the AH?", "created_utc": 1676035390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yrvw3/aita_for_humiliating_my_ex_after_he_tried_to/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You finished what he started.", "NTA and anyone saying E S H and you should have turned the other cheek is the type of person who would sit quietly and not say shit when people get bullied. Standing up for yourself to a bully never makes you an AH, even if the bully is drunk.", "NTA\n\n\u201edon\u2019t dish the menu if you can\u2019t eat it\u201c\u2026 simple", "NTA.

He was obviously being shitty towards you, but instead of ignoring him and not taking the bait you escalated it. \n\nPart of the reason this behavior makes you the AH is also because while you mean to only target him, you also said mean things about personal trainers and short men which could apply to other attendees.", "ESH you're both snobby af. Fair enough to try and retaliate but both of you seem to thinking earning more = being superiour.

Clearly you shouldn't be in the same place, but if you are in the future, ignore him. Act like he's not even there. You're giving him what he wants when you engage.", "ESH - your cousin is right. You should take the high road.  One comment back at him wasn't a problem. It's when you didn't let it go because he wouldn't let it go. As a rule, just ignore people like that. This situation will absolutely happen again, but how you react can be different. People like that (trust me, you're going to meet lots of them through your lifetime) aren't worth your energy or time. They serve no positive purpose in the moment except to frusterate you and who *needs* that? Not you. His interruption or comments aren't worth the air you'd waste replying.", "ESH, the best play would have been to ignore him. Everyone would have been talking about what a jerk he was the next day.  By engaging you may have also made yourself look bad. I get it made you feel better in the moment, though.", "NTA", "NTA  You defended yourself , Awesomely \ud83d\udd25", "NTA.\n\nStones and glass houses.

You owe your abuser nothing.", "NTA.\n\nwhy are they mad at you for being harassed??", "NTA he drank everything himself and nobody forced it into him so everything that happened and was said as a direct result of that is Completely on him. \n\nPlus if cousin had a problem they should have intervened when ex started on his bs.", "NTA. He tried to pick a fight and lost.\n\nEdit: That remark about quitting school when math started to have letters in it. Brilliant. I will use this on the next ignoramus who tries to humiliate me.", "NTA, I hate people who give it, but can\u2019t take it. If you\u2019re acting like an ass, you totally deserve what you get.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give it out if you can\u2019t take it. I don\u2019t agree being abused by someone because they\u2019re drunk means they are excused from their actions.", "NTA. Where were these friends when he was harassing you all night? Why didn't anyone cut him off or stop serving him alcohol? They watched him bully and interrupt you all night and you were just supposed to take it?

If your so called \"friends\" had stuck up for you when he was clearly harassing and trying to bully you, you wouldn't have had to do it yourself. Sounds like broflaski bit off more than he could chew to me.", "Nothing pisses me off more than people who can dish it out but the second it comes back to them they can't take it and play the victim. Sure you could have \"taken the high road\", but some people need knocking down a peg or 2.", "NTA, but I'm not sure if I would be proud of myself either.  He stated with you and you responded,  but you probably could have walked away after that.", "ESH, but you moreso. Why on earth would you engage in a pissing contest with a drunk person? Honestly, it just makes you look childish and pathetic.\n\nYou also greatly offended every personal trainer and 40-year-olds.", "NTA when people want you to be the bigger person that means give into and accept the abuse. If it was them he was slandering then I'm sure they would have stuck up for themselves. \n\nWhy couldn't ex be an adult who doesn't get so drunk, or not run his mouth at someone else's party. Why is it all on you because you can control your drinking in a social situation. \n\nThese people are not your friends as they should have put a stop to him as the HOSTS of this party. Tell them you won't be harassed and verbally assaulted for their convenience and asking you to be the bigger person shows how small of a person they are.", "NTA since he doesn\u2019t understand math very well it makes sense he wouldn\u2019t understand that the amount you fuck around is directly proportional to the amount you find out.", "NTA.  F around and find out.  Being drunk is a poor excuse for bad behavior.", "NTA - Now what you said wasn\u2019t nice, but he provoked you. Next time he is harassing you in public, try to record him on your cellphone being drunk and saying insulting things. Only if necessary. It\u2019s not illegal if you show him you are recording. He will either become nicer or become enraged, incriminating himself.", "NTA\n\nBut I would like to know if the hostess is aware her bf is sending these messages, or if he prefers to defend bullies without her knowledge", "NTA why didnt your host take the actual high road and stop the only real asshole from harassing you? you were stating objective fact.", "How old were you when you started dating cause I'm confused", "the way my hand shot to my mouth when you said the drop out of high school part LMAO\n\nNTA", "ESH - you both need to grow up.  And just for the record plenty of people want 40 yr old trainers.", "NTA\n\nHe had it coming. FAAFO", "NTA. You did take the higher road and tried to ignore him. Its his fault he kept pushing you after that. Being drunk isn't an excuse for that. If anything the people that supposedly say you should have taken the higher road should have been the ones to tell him to stop if they feel so strongly about the victim snapping back at him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
