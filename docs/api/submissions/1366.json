It felt like a highschool crush where I get nervous when she's around and I find myself having the urge to send her a message randomly just so I can talk to her. \n\nIt led to me being distracted and it bothered me that this was taking over me despite me having a busy month. That, coupled with the guilt that I was thinking of someone else other than my partner and that I was thinking of my friend differently weighed down on me. \n\nIt all came to a tipping point days ago when I, without thinking too much, decided to tell her how I felt through a text. I was high on emotions that day because of work stuff and I know that it was a bad lapse in judgment. \n\nShe told me she didn't get why I told her. I said that maybe I told her so that someone can tell me that my feelings are ridiculous and maybe that will make it stop.\n\nShe said it's unfair that I dumped this info on her and then I made it her responsibility to decide if we're OK. \n\nShe asked me if I think telling her to get it out of my chest worth it considering that we're awkward now. I told her that it wasn't, and that I regret it, and I'll stay away, and maybe we can be friends once I've moved on from her. \n\nShe told me that we can still be friends and she doesn't think there's any reason for her to change how she interacts with me.\n\nDays after this, I asked if we could talk. I told her I apologize for everything. She asked why I needed to say this. I said that I'm scared to lose her as a friend and I also wanted to know if we'll be awkward. She told me that even if she wanted to not be awkward, she now has to be careful with her actions around me because her actions might be misinterpreted. She said she can't even tease me playfully like before because maybe now it will seem like she's just being mean to me, and that she's obligated to respond even to my most random messages, just because I might misinterpret her nonresponse as her reacting negatively to my feelings. She said she can't even be herself now because she has to be careful.\n\nShe also asked if she changed something that led to me getting attracted to her. I said she changed nothing, I just started feeling things. She said she just wanted to know if it was her fault.\n\nI also asked if we're OK. She said she's not sure what that means and to be more specific. I said that I was mostly concerned about how she feels, as in does she feel OK towards me? She says she's not sure, and that we'll see.\n\nShe also said maybe I don't even really like her. She said that maybe I misinterpreted my feelings andI was just feeling something like separation anxiety from her after we spend time together. I told her that didn't matter, whatever it is, I'm working on processing my feelings so I can let it go.\n\nAm I really the asshole in this mess?", "created_utc": 1667600888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymcf28/aita_for_telling_a_friend_i_like_her_out_of_the/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm pretty much agreeing with everything this colleague is saying lol. You'd do well to listen to her too.", "Absolutely the AH. I feel bad for both your partner (for the emotional affair you\u2019re clearly having) and your \u201cfriend\u201d (for dumping the responsibility of a decision on her).", "Unfortunately, YTA. You mentioned you both had long term relationships, so dropping that was inappropriate if she's seeing someone else, and because YOU also have a partner.\n\nAlso, dumping the entire emotional bombshell is a bit much. This could have been a conversation to break the ice and ease into feeling if she was interested, versus confessing your undying love.\n\nYes, it's gonna be awkward for awhile, and you definitely changed the dynamics of the friendship where she will have to gauge and decide how you'll take her actions as an unwanted advance.\n\nYou may need to give her some space and time to process everything. Meantime, she gave you an answer, so need to back off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
