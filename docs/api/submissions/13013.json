Walk with your grandfather. You will remember it for the rest of your life.", "NTA. It's your big day and you can ask whomever you want to walk you down the aisle. You chose a person you're very close to over a father that has been largely absent during your life.", "You are NTA.  The person walking you down the aisle is a deeply personal decision, should be the person you want sending you off into your next phase of life, be it your grandfather, your mother, your brother/uncle/best friend or just walking by your self.  You barely know the man, he\u2019s not close with you, and this isn\u2019t about him - it\u2019s about YOU.

Not you.", "NTA- it is your wedding and you get to choose who walks with you down the aisle. Your grandfather was the male figure in your life who supported you the most and should get that honor. Just because someone is biologically your father does not mean they fulfilled that roll. You're Dad can be hurt all he wants but this is the consequences of being an absent father", "NTA, your wedding your choice. He's made his bed, these are the consequences of his actions.", "NTA.

You are simply honoring your grandfather for his presence and influence in your life.  \nIt\u2019s great your dad wants to return and repair things now, but by definition, that means he must acknowledge that he did damage in the first place.

You don't owe your father anything.", "NAH - okay, long-term your father was an asshole but we're talking about the situation at hand. Your father has been feeling remorse for abandoning you, is trying to make it right and not walking you down the aisle is a big, public reminder of his failures as a father. He's not wrong to feel hurt. It likely feels worse knowing it's his own doing.\n\nBut that sort of reconciliation takes time, and you shouldn't set aside your feelings for his, especially on your wedding day.

It's your wedding and you can ask whomever you want to be a part of it. Add to that after being an absent parent during your teen years, he doesn't get to come in with demands at this point. He can feel bad, that doesn't mean you did something wrong.", "NTA, It's your big day and you are not being unreasonable. It is totally your choice who you want to walk you down the aisle", "NTA. If you feel more closely bonded with your grandpa, why the hell not? It's your big day and it should be what you feel best doing.", "NTA- I'll always stand by the idea of \"your wedding, your choice.\" You're father did not have much contact with you after your parents divorce. He didn't make the effort to visit his children and that's on him. It's good that you are reconnecting with him, but has he even met your fianc\u00e9? Why should your dad have a part, no less a big part, in your wedding? If your grandfather was more involved and you've already decided, then there's no question about it. You're not a bad person for not wanting your dad to walk you down the aisle. My dad and I also had an estranged relationship and he did not walk me down the aisle either.", "NTA. It is not a right that he has, your sister didn\u2019t go with it so she clearly didn\u2019t think it was right and after how he has behaved why would he think you want him involved like that? Stick with your grandfather and don\u2019t feel bad about it.", "NTA. It isn't your fault how all this unfolded and even if his disappointment is reasonable (which I'm not sure it is TBH), it doesn't make sense for you to be uncomfortable at your own wedding. Walk down the aisle with the person that makes sense, to you, to walk you in. \n\nMy hope is that your relationship with your father will continue to rebuild and heal, and this will be a blip long-term. It's an unfortunate consequence he's facing now for having fallen out of touch with you. I can't really tell how much of that history is his 'fault' exactly, but I'm sure it was not yours. \n\nMaybe you can find another special job for him at the wedding...will you do a father-daughter dance perhaps? That (or something else entirely!) might be a way for you to involve him in a task that you feel comfortable with him doing.", "NTA - congratulations on your upcoming wedding!!  Just to remind you, the wedding is about you and the person you are going to marry - nobody else.  You can choose to have someone walk you down the aisle (or not), and it should be the person you feel most comfortable with.  Your decision to have your grandpa do it sounds lovely.  Best wishes!!", "NTA - I\u2019m one of those people who didn\u2019t like the traditional wedding things and what they used to mean. So I had both my parents walk me half way, my fianc\u00e9 met us in the middle and we walked the rest of the way together. \n\nYou should escorted by the person who\u2019s supported you most. Your dad needs to understand that\u2019s not a statement against him, it\u2019s a statement for grandpa. And, imo, part of reconciliation is acknowledging the mistake that we\u2019re made, even if they hurt.", "Wow.  \n\nI think it's good that your father feels remorse - he should.  I think it's remarkably generous of you to allow him a chance to be a part of your life (Especially after the tattoo thing!  The hell??).  I truly hope it works out and you can have a good relationship, or at least a decent one.   \n\nBut he wasn't there.  Your grandfather was.  And that's really all that has to be considered.  You don't owe this honor to your father.  He owed it to you to be a good dad.  He didn't come through, and therefore, he didn't earn the right to walk you down the aisle.  That's on him, not you. \n\nYour wedding, your choice.  And your Grandpa, who has been there for you no matter what.  For what it's worth, I think you're doing it right.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!  NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe made his choices. If he's upset, just ask him \"how do you think I felt?\" Remind him that you tried and that he not only shot you down, he covered over that tattoo. You could say, \"you gotta put in the work to get the reward.\"", "NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t get the privileges of being a father if you don\u2019t meet the responsibilities of being a father.", "NTA. Mom had her grandpa walk her down the aisle because her father refused to step foot in a church.\n\nYou don't really have a relationship with your dad so he's out of line.", "It was. It kind of felt like he was trying to erase his children from his life.", "My dad abandoned me when I was three but I know from my half brother that he still has my name tattooed on his chest.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how big of an AH you\u2019d have to be to erase/cover your child\u2019s name.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour grandfather was consistently in your life, your father wasn't. Your grandfather has **earned** your love & respect, he's been there for you. Your father can be as hurt as he wants, but he wasn't around. \n\nAsking your grandfather to walk with you is a beautiful acknowledgement of how much he means to you.", "That was a horrible gut punch.\n\nNTA", "I understand that feeling.

The whole \"giving away the bride\" represents something meaningful. It's an act of a loving parent who gave her life and helped the bride grow, giving her away to the person she'll love this life with.\n\nYour dad didn't play this tole in your life your life, your grandpa did. So if your dad wants to play butthurt contest, I guess you could remind him the reasons he's not walking you down the aisle. He doesn't get to be upset about it when he has so much to make up for. The audacity, fuck.", "Nah him covering up the tattoo of his kids names was the day the relationship between y\u2019all died! He sucks!

Your wedding, your choice.", "*With a truck.* A fucking *truck*. Fuck him. Cherish your relationship with your grandfather, and give him the honour of walking you down the aisle. Also, be wary of your father\u2019s intentions with reconnecting\u2026there may be ulterior motives - people that self-absorbed rarely make moves to reconcile for altruistic reasons."]}
