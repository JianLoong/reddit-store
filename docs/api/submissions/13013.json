Walk with your grandfather. You will remember it for the rest of your life.", "NTA. It's your big day and you can ask whomever you want to walk you down the aisle. You chose a person you're very close to over a father that has been largely absent during your life.", "You are NTA.  The person walking you down the aisle is a deeply personal decision, should be the person you want sending you off into your next phase of life, be it your grandfather, your mother, your brother/uncle/best friend or just walking by your self.  You barely know the man, he\u2019s not close with you, and this isn\u2019t about him - it\u2019s about YOU.

Not you.", "NTA- it is your wedding and you get to choose who walks with you down the aisle. Your grandfather was the male figure in your life who supported you the most and should get that honor. Just because someone is biologically your father does not mean they fulfilled that roll.

Your father has been feeling remorse for abandoning you, is trying to make it right and not walking you down the aisle is a big, public reminder of his failures as a father. He's not wrong to feel hurt. It likely feels worse knowing it's his own doing.\n\nBut that sort of reconciliation takes time, and you shouldn't set aside your feelings for his, especially on your wedding day.

It's your wedding and you can ask whomever you want to be a part of it. Add to that after being an absent parent during your teen years, he doesn't get to come in with demands at this point. He can feel bad, that doesn't mean you did something wrong.", "NTA, It's your big day and you are not being unreasonable. It is totally your choice who you want to walk you down the aisle", "NTA. If you feel more closely bonded with your grandpa, why the hell not? It's your big day and it should be what you feel best doing.", "NTA- I'll always stand by the idea of \"your wedding, your choice.\" You're father did not have much contact with you after your parents divorce. He didn't make the effort to visit his children and that's on him. It's good that you are reconnecting with him, but has he even met your fianc\u00e9? Why should your dad have a part, no less a big part, in your wedding? If your grandfather was more involved and you've already decided, then there's no question about it. You're not a bad person for not wanting your dad to walk you down the aisle. My dad and I also had an estranged relationship and he did not walk me down the aisle either.", "NTA. It is not a right that he has, your sister didn\u2019t go with it so she clearly didn\u2019t think it was right and after how he has behaved why would he think you want him involved like that? Stick with your grandfather and don\u2019t feel bad about it.", "NTA. It isn't your fault how all this unfolded and even if his disappointment is reasonable (which I'm not sure it is TBH), it doesn't make sense for you to be uncomfortable at your own wedding. Walk down the aisle with the person that makes sense, to you, to walk you in. \n\nMy hope is that your relationship with your father will continue to rebuild and heal, and this will be a blip long-term. It's an unfortunate consequence he's facing now for having fallen out of touch with you. I can't really tell how much of that history is his 'fault' exactly, but I'm sure it was not yours. \n\nMaybe you can find another special job for him at the wedding...will you do a father-daughter dance perhaps? That (or something else entirely!) might be a way for you to involve him in a task that you feel comfortable with him doing.", "NTA - congratulations on your upcoming wedding!!  Just to remind you, the wedding is about you and the person you are going to marry - nobody else.  You can choose to have someone walk you down the aisle (or not), and it should be the person you feel most comfortable with.  Your decision to have your grandpa do it sounds lovely.  Best wishes!!", "NTA - I\u2019m one of those people who didn\u2019t like the traditional wedding things and what they used to mean. So I had both my parents walk me half way, my fianc\u00e9 met us in the middle and we walked the rest of the way together. \n\nYou should escorted by the person who\u2019s supported you most. Your dad needs to understand that\u2019s not a statement against him, it\u2019s a statement for grandpa. And, imo, part of reconciliation is acknowledging the mistake that we\u2019re made, even if they hurt.", "Wow.  \n\nI think it's good that your father feels remorse - he should.  I think it's remarkably generous of you to allow him a chance to be a part of your life (Especially after the tattoo thing!  The hell??).  I truly hope it works out and you can have a good relationship, or at least a decent one.   \n\nBut he wasn't there.  Your grandfather was.  And that's really all that has to be considered.  You don't owe this honor to your father.  He owed it to you to be a good dad.  He didn't come through, and therefore, he didn't earn the right to walk you down the aisle.  That's on him, not you. \n\nYour wedding, your choice.  And your Grandpa, who has been there for you no matter what.  For what it's worth, I think you're doing it right.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!  NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe made his choices.

I do not regret asking my grandfather to walk me down the aisle as I was so close to him. The memories are very precious now he has passed away. Your wedding is your special day so celebrate it with your special people.", "NTA. \n\nTo quote the second Guardians of the Galaxy movie, \"He might have been your father, but he wasn't your daddy.\"\n\nSounds like OP's father was only a father in the legal sense of the word (i.e. by being the breadwinner) long before her parents' divorce.\n\nI've seen countless parents like the father in this sub and it's always confusing to see how oblivious they can be. He's supposedly remorseful for his absence in OP and her sister's lives, but he expects them to let him back in without making any effort to make amends (at least as far as we know).", "NTA\n\nTell him if he's so upset, he can walk down the aisle alone while holding a toy truck. Since that obviously means more to him than you or your sisters.", "What he's remorseful about is that the weddings expose he was not what a father should be. People note \"oh, huh, someone else is walking her, not all is well there.\" He feels everyone will think there's an issue there.\n\nWell, that's just a natural consequence of past actions. If he's truly trying to rebuild a relationship, this is a lump he should be willing to take, and frankly without complaint.\n\nNot bc you are trying to punish him, but bc this is the time when you honor those who helped you and it turns out that's not him.\n\nThis is *not* directed against him. This is to ensure those who walk you get the honor you want them to have.", "Or it was a painful reminder of kids who clearly wanted nothing to do with him and took their mother's side in the divorce.", "That is incredibly true.", "There Would be NO reconnecting back with me, in fact I would tell him to stay gone and not come back, he\u2019s not part of my family\u2026 he lost that privilege when he erased us out of his life.", "NTA. The petty part of me is picturing OP carrying a toy truck down the aisle as the representation of the dad.", "NTA it should be whoever you want, and if that\u2019s your grandfather, so be it.

He made his choices and has to deal with the consequences. He wasn\u2019t there for you and prioritized his new family. Covering up a tattoo of your name with a freaking truck is one of the lowest things someone could do. I have my three daughter\u2019s names on my arm and could never imagine covering them up.
