Another post on this sub today was from a dad who was mad that his teen son was making money milling lumber using a busted sawmill he bought cheap and repaired, and I feel like there's a very similar energy coming from your parents.

I'm happy for you and wish you continued success!", "I don't think anyone is an AH here...\n\nAs a parent I can see why they would want you to get a more traditional job. Usually side gigs like this aren't great in the long run, and it is hard to stay on top of an ever turning trend market.\n\na regular part time job for a teen generally teaches responsibility, how to interact with people, time management, punctuality, etc. I think it is great that you found a way to make money doing something you like. Your teen years are supposed to be the time where you learn who you are, have fun, make memories, etc. My parents wanted me to focus on this and school rather than working. If I wanted money for something that wasn't a necessity (for example, dance tickets) I'd earn it by doing chores around the house, babysitting, etc.\n\nIt's not irrational. A little lazy, yes. You are doing work and learning responsibility so I would just try to let it go for now.", "NTA, your parents are quashing your entrepreneurial initiative because they ignorantly believe that working harder is better than working smarter.", "ESH.\n\nYour parents told you that you needed to earn your own money, so you did.  They don't get to tell you that you're doing it wrong simply because you didn't do it the same way that they would.\n\nBut I'd also implore you to do some reading on what upselling thrifted items is doing to the second-hand industry.  You're essentially taking trendy items out of the hands of people who couldn't otherwise afford them.  And the influx of people like you is driving up prices at thrift stores and pricing out the people who truly need them.  So unfortunately your money-making scheme IS lazy and comes with some real-world consequences.", "NAH\n\nYour parents are an older generation and I understand their point of view. \n\nI absolutely love what you are doing and applaud your entrepreneurial spirit. \n\nI would offer this one piece of advice, if your gig is going well and it starts to generate more than $600 per year and you are not filing taxes, you could find yourself in trouble with the IRS. Conducting business online is trackable and if you are using a service like PayPal to collect your money, PayPal starts reporting deposit activity over $600 per year to the IRS. The Small Business Administration has a division called SCORE. Their services are free and you can get assigned a free business coach who can help guide you through the tax thresholds and understand how long you can keep this income under the table and when this has crossed the threshold into small business and tax filings.", "NTA\n\nWork smart, not hard. I absolutely understand where your parents are coming from. Having a standard part time job gives you the chance to develop your social skills, to understand grafting for your pay, to enhance time management and prioritising tasks. It also helps to have a specific job on your CV.\n\nHowever, you are at an age where you don't *have* to work long and hard hours at a job you don't see the benefit in (that mostly comes when you are older). \n\nYou have the advantage of a safety net to try things and fail. You might not be following the oft treaded path, but you are developing your skills as an entrepreneur. You are utilising your knowledge of an industry and are providing a service/meeting a need. You are learning cause and effect- if you buy the wrong thing and it doesn't sell then you have made an error in judgement. \n\nIt might look like it's the easy way out, but that is just because you are good at it. If I were in your shoes what takes you 2-4 hours overall could take 8-10. \n\nIf you explain to your parents all of the skills you are developing they may be able to see your job in a different light. You could always suggest you give them 5-10% of your profit as keep.\n\nYou could also volunteer (even if it's 1-2 hours a week) to help develop the skills your parents think you'd benefit from learning. Plus, if you volunteered at a thrift shop you'd get first dibs and could kill two birds with one stone.", "Ugh no.

You are committing a crime by not reporting your income!", "I\u2019m going against the grain with YTA. DePop has been a thing for a while now, it\u2019s hardly being an entrepreneur. You\u2019re going to secondhand stores to buy donated items so you can resell them at a higher price. It\u2019s not a very moral when you consider that those clothes were donated with the intent to go to someone less fortunate, not so some kid can profit off of his shopping addiction. \n\nEveryone should work in the food industry or retail at least once in their life. It builds character, teaches time management, and it would do you good to serve others rather than just yourself.", "ESH.\n\nWhether one agrees with the ethics of upselling thrift clothes, you *are* being lazy in that you are only working 3-4 hours per week. The argument of saying, \"why work more for the same money?\" is flawed because in this day, the cost of education and housing is so incredibly expensive that any logical person would be putting in the same hours to the higher paying job in order to make the most money possible. Enough money that it legit defers some of the expense burden to your parents or helps you save for a house or vehicle. What you are doing is the bare minimum effort to make the bare minimum of money. And that makes you mildly lazy. At least with a traditional job, your parents would have accepted that you are at least trying the hardest you can. You are not really trying that hard here. You aren't showing grit or perseverance. \n\nNow, your parents should not be discouraging you from doing something you enjoy, but encouraging you to work harder at it. Grow your business, consider a job in fashion if that is your interest, modify or sew your own clothes to sell.", "I\u2019m going to leave aside the thrift lecture because I see you\u2019re already getting it.

Like paying into social security, unemployment, Medicare. It builds your credit, and if you have a long line of paychecks and money in the bank it makes it that much easier for things you\u2019ll want later. Like car loans and student loans and home loans. Yes, it\u2019s not as fun. But you won\u2019t be thrift resaling forever.

It's a different set of skills than the ones they wanted you to develop, but the skills are still valuable.

The ability to identify a business opportunity, to budget, to execute (selecting the items, presenting the items, pricing the items, using the technology...) - these are all great skills.\n2. Just having the discipline to execute the tasks and the self-motivation to manage your own affairs - this is some of what you are trying to develop.\n3. If it's working well - you are making enough to cover your discretionary spending expenses. then that's another goal of theirs that you've met.\n4. (I do think you should be prepared that this approach will not always be the best for you. Sometimes, you may have to actually put in long, hard hours to achieve something you want.) But working long, hard, hours is not an actual end-goal of most people. It's one means to achieve/attain the ultimate goal. It seems you are successfully achieving yours.

There are people who shop there because they can\u2019t afford anything else, that is the point of them. Also, young people who are smaller sizes do shop at thrift stores, myself included. Those arguments don\u2019t change the point I was making, if anything it reinforces it. If you\u2019re shopping at a thrift store for yourself, no matter your income, have at it. It helps stop the issue we have with fast fashion and all the clothes that end up in landfills. If you condone people buying donated clothes so they can make extra money off of people who could otherwise shop elsewhere, cool do you. Doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it takes \u201ctrendy\u201d and good quality clothes at cheap prices from poor people and defeats the purpose of having a cheap alternative to fashion. It creates a middle man who\u2019s only contribution is finding the clothes but then upsells them for usually double or triple the cost they found the clothes at.

That's not immoral, that's playing within the rules of the thrift store itself. There are other thrift type stores that actually do provide clothes for free or nearly free for people who truly cant afford them by using criteria to limit who is able to access them. That's where it would be immoral to pretend you meet that criteria just to go in and resell the stuff that was exclusively for people who cant afford it. \n\nJust because something is a \"thrift store\" doesn't mean it's actually about helping anyone wear clothes that are trendy for cheap at all... most of them are actually just about making profits. If it's open to the general public and there's no criteria to buy from it, then quite frankly it's none of your or anyone else's business who buys or what they do with it when they buy.
