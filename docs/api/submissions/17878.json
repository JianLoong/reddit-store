I'm happy for you and wish you continued success!", "I don't think anyone is an AH here...\n\nAs a parent I can see why they would want you to get a more traditional job. Usually side gigs like this aren't great in the long run, and it is hard to stay on top of an ever turning trend market.\n\na regular part time job for a teen generally teaches responsibility, how to interact with people, time management, punctuality, etc. I think it is great that you found a way to make money doing something you like. Your teen years are supposed to be the time where you learn who you are, have fun, make memories, etc. My parents wanted me to focus on this and school rather than working. If I wanted money for something that wasn't a necessity (for example, dance tickets) I'd earn it by doing chores around the house, babysitting, etc.\n\nIt's not irrational. A little lazy, yes.

They don't get to tell you that you're doing it wrong simply because you didn't do it the same way that they would.\n\nBut I'd also implore you to do some reading on what upselling thrifted items is doing to the second-hand industry.  You're essentially taking trendy items out of the hands of people who couldn't otherwise afford them.  And the influx of people like you is driving up prices at thrift stores and pricing out the people who truly need them.  So unfortunately your money-making scheme IS lazy and comes with some real-world consequences.", "NAH\n\nYour parents are an older generation and I understand their point of view. \n\nI absolutely love what you are doing and applaud your entrepreneurial spirit. \n\nI would offer this one piece of advice, if your gig is going well and it starts to generate more than $600 per year and you are not filing taxes, you could find yourself in trouble with the IRS. Conducting business online is trackable and if you are using a service like PayPal to collect your money, PayPal starts reporting deposit activity over $600 per year to the IRS. The Small Business Administration has a division called SCORE. Their services are free and you can get assigned a free business coach who can help guide you through the tax thresholds and understand how long you can keep this income under the table and when this has crossed the threshold into small business and tax filings.", "NTA\n\nWork smart, not hard. I absolutely understand where your parents are coming from. Having a standard part time job gives you the chance to develop your social skills, to understand grafting for your pay, to enhance time management and prioritising tasks. It also helps to have a specific job on your CV.\n\nHowever, you are at an age where you don't *have* to work long and hard hours at a job you don't see the benefit in (that mostly comes when you are older). \n\nYou have the advantage of a safety net to try things and fail. You might not be following the oft treaded path, but you are developing your skills as an entrepreneur. You are utilising your knowledge of an industry and are providing a service/meeting a need. You are learning cause and effect- if you buy the wrong thing and it doesn't sell then you have made an error in judgement. \n\nIt might look like it's the easy way out, but that is just because you are good at it. If I were in your shoes what takes you 2-4 hours overall could take 8-10. \n\nIf you explain to your parents all of the skills you are developing they may be able to see your job in a different light. You could always suggest you give them 5-10% of your profit as keep.\n\nYou could also volunteer (even if it's 1-2 hours a week) to help develop the skills your parents think you'd benefit from learning.

You\u2019re going to secondhand stores to buy donated items so you can resell them at a higher price. It\u2019s not a very moral when you consider that those clothes were donated with the intent to go to someone less fortunate, not so some kid can profit off of his shopping addiction. \n\nEveryone should work in the food industry or retail at least once in their life. It builds character, teaches time management, and it would do you good to serve others rather than just yourself.", "ESH.\n\nWhether one agrees with the ethics of upselling thrift clothes, you *are* being lazy in that you are only working 3-4 hours per week. The argument of saying, \"why work more for the same money?\" is flawed because in this day, the cost of education and housing is so incredibly expensive that any logical person would be putting in the same hours to the higher paying job in order to make the most money possible. Enough money that it legit defers some of the expense burden to your parents or helps you save for a house or vehicle. What you are doing is the bare minimum effort to make the bare minimum of money. And that makes you mildly lazy. At least with a traditional job, your parents would have accepted that you are at least trying the hardest you can. You are not really trying that hard here. You aren't showing grit or perseverance. \n\nNow, your parents should not be discouraging you from doing something you enjoy, but encouraging you to work harder at it.

Like paying into social security, unemployment, Medicare. It builds your credit, and if you have a long line of paychecks and money in the bank it makes it that much easier for things you\u2019ll want later. Like car loans and student loans and home loans. Yes, it\u2019s not as fun. But you won\u2019t be thrift resaling forever.

It's a different set of skills than the ones they wanted you to develop, but the skills are still valuable.

The ability to identify a business opportunity, to budget, to execute (selecting the items, presenting the items, pricing the items, using the technology...) - these are all great skills.\n2. Just having the discipline to execute the tasks and the self-motivation to manage your own affairs - this is some of what you are trying to develop.\n3. If it's working well - you are making enough to cover your discretionary spending expenses. then that's another goal of theirs that you've met.\n4. (I do think you should be prepared that this approach will not always be the best for you. Sometimes, you may have to actually put in long, hard hours to achieve something you want.) But working long, hard, hours is not an actual end-goal of most people. It's one means to achieve/attain the ultimate goal. It seems you are successfully achieving yours.

There are people who shop there because they can\u2019t afford anything else, that is the point of them. Also, young people who are smaller sizes do shop at thrift stores, myself included. Those arguments don\u2019t change the point I was making, if anything it reinforces it. If you\u2019re shopping at a thrift store for yourself, no matter your income, have at it. It helps stop the issue we have with fast fashion and all the clothes that end up in landfills. If you condone people buying donated clothes so they can make extra money off of people who could otherwise shop elsewhere, cool do you. Doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it takes \u201ctrendy\u201d and good quality clothes at cheap prices from poor people and defeats the purpose of having a cheap alternative to fashion. It creates a middle man who\u2019s only contribution is finding the clothes but then upsells them for usually double or triple the cost they found the clothes at.

Is that the conclusion?\" Highlighting the last statement I made regarding changes in pricing of thrift goods. While I normally try not to engage in such moral grandstanding rhetoric, I will, however, make an exception here. Primarily because I do not want any reader to take that statement as a \"Bah, humbug! Who cares about the poor? Capitalism is the best!!\" I have my own gripes with capitalism lmao.\n\nHowever, here are some things to note.\n\nAs other users have pointed out, a lot more clothes come in than go out. Most of the clothes that are donated end up getting burnt. Not only is that a waste of resources, but also bad for the environment.\n\nAdditionally, what I had said was \"the impact it **MAY** have...\" which is to say... I'm not sure it does have a significant impact on the price. But that is perhaps a bit \"I'll weasel my way out of what I said\", but it is what it is.\n\nContinuing further with the statement made (i.e. \"Fuck the most impoverished ones?\"), I think anyone who thinks that a lack of resellers for thrift goods is going to have any meaningful impact in the lives of the impoverished is sorely mistaken.\n\nThe impoverished community has **a lot** of difficulties in their lives. A lack of access to proper sanitation, hygiene, drinking water, food, shelter, etc. These issues won't be resolved by a lack of resellers. These issues can only be resolved through a proper support system which can help the impoverished and the dehoused individuals find a way back in the society. Such welfare programmes are absolutely essential for the support of the impoverished ones.\n\nBut I digress. \n\nTrying to suggest that resellers = \"fuck the poor\" is not only a misguided statement, it is a fallacious argument to make. By the same extension, if you have a smartphone, \"so, what? Fuck the kids in China?\"\n\nWorse, still (somehow, even worse than child labour), if you have products in your home that were made in a specific region in China, that would most likely be a product of slave labour (Chinese concentration camps).\n\nThis sort of whataboutism goes nowhere. It is better to direct your passion and energy towards actually supporting policies and politicians who can more meaningfully address the issues of the impoverished families. In addition to that, the best way to help impoverished people is to... Well, help impoverished people. Instead of donating to Goodwill, donate to people who need it. Donate to charitable organisations (after doing a thorough investigation of said organisations, as a lot of them tend to serve the managers moreso than the communities they advertise to serve).\n\nThere are a lot of ways to help impoverished people and marginalised communities. Trying to achieve a moral high ground on Reddit is not one of them.", "I've read 3 different replies from people who work in thrift shops, saying the same thing.

I live in a city that's great for thrifters, as so many people here have way too much money, so if you shop in the right areas, you can find amazing designer clothes that are basically new (often with tags still attached) at Goodwill.\n\nBut even if you don't live in a thrifter's paradise, there are tons of sites where you can find used clothes for cheap and then resell them. Thredup used to be awesome for it, because they'd have biannual sales where a ton of stuff would be marked down to 99 cents. I'd eventually end up selling those same clothes back to Thredup and get paid an average of $20-$25/item (yeah, it was crazy; they were basically paying me to rent clothes). Sadly, as they've expanded, they no longer do that sale, and they don't pay much anymore, but that was a beautiful couple of years.", "Great idea!

My guess is that he may currently be putting in more hours than he might at a more typical job, but mainly because he's new to it, and the ratio of time/income will become far more favorable the longer he does it.

High-value items might be sold by auction. I\u2019ve brought clothes to thrift stores like this and been told that nothing was cool enough for them to buy. Then you have charity shops like Goodwill. Those stores accept donations and take almost anything. Have you ever seen the donations bin at a goodwill in a major city on drop day? It\u2019s filled in 10 minutes! Goodwill employees sort the clothes and figure out what they can resell and what they need to scrap. Items that don\u2019t sell at goodwill after a few weeks, or that are in poor enough quality that goodwill won\u2019t stock them, are either thrown in a landfill or bought by bulk buyers, by weight. Some of those bulk buyers are ALSO thrift stores, which in turn sell to buyers, some of them resellers. A costume designer friend of mine used to shop at a store in NJ that sold leather jackets for $5/pound. Resellable items from THOSE stores are shipped overseas and sold at an even greater discount, or sold to recyclers to make reusable bags and other \u201cgreen\u201d products, or thrown in the trash. \n\nThis multi-layered, complex industry exists for one reason: because people can make money off of it.

Companies will pay you to pick out fashionable wholesale items for them to stock in retail, and people will stop giving you a hard time about thrift stores.

No one has said thrift stores *only* serve low income people, but it is inarguable that a thrift reseller is pricing low income people out of the used clothing market. If they cannot find these good quality, trendy clothes at the thrift store, they will go to fast fashion and create more waste. Thrift resellers are indirectly creating more waste when they take the in demand clothing and not the stuff that would go to waste anyway. \n\nAlso, shoes are something that a lot of lower income families will invest in.

For instance, most of the clothes I have bought and sold have been in the thrift stores I shop in for at least 40 days, and on a good day I might find 5-10 pieces I want to buy and resell in a thrift store with literally thousands of clothing pieces to go through. Reselling clothes is actually an astonishing amount of legwork, so the notion that resellers are just walking in and pulling off racks of clothes to resell for a profit at the expense of poor people is a wild misconception."]}
