We were like brothers growing up. The bride to be was a good friend of mine in elementary though we only recently reconnected. The wedding is an hour away on a Saturday. My fianc\u00e9e has a party in celebration of the passing of someone she knew for around a year the same Sunday, but I do totally understand that he provided a much desired father figure during the time she knew him. I explained to her multiple times and ways, plus to my best friend, how I felt she was abandoning me and being lazy as a fianc\u00e9e. In my defense about calling her lazy to my friend, I was drunk. Against me, I should have been in more control and been more tactful which I recognize that fully.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s family had two events to celebrate his life prior to now (November and December) and I made sure to show up to both with her.\n\nJust speaking logistically about the wedding: she could be home and asleep by midnight Saturday to still go on her party Sunday, and she has Sunday after 2pm and all of Monday to recover any lost sleep. But instead, she said no. Not only that, but at first she kept saying she had to think about it, but when it got to the 2 week mark for when we absolutely had to RSVP, she got angry I kept asking and didn\u2019t think about her party. Part of me understands this party is important to her, the rest of me is hurt and feels like she isn\u2019t putting any priority on what is important to me either. Especially because she hates dressing up so I feel like this is just a convenient excuse. Even though it\u2019s important to me, it hurts she doesn\u2019t care to adjust plans to support me.\n\nThe other night, after the RSVP timeframe, a mutual friend asked her what she was wearing to the wedding, and after she implied she was going but wasn\u2019t sure about her dress, I said (kinda bluntly) that she wasn\u2019t going. The mood got sour and tangled up, and afterward she got mad at me for saying she chose not to when she \u201ccouldn\u2019t go\u201d", "created_utc": 1695605348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16retid/aita_for_telling_our_friends_my_fianc\u00e9e_wont_be/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's perfectly fair to say she doesn't want to go to the wedding. Nothing particularly wrong with that, I dislike weddings and avoid them myself, though it would be nicer of her if she did accompany you. Bottom line she's not being forced by circumstances, she's choosing not to attend. You weren't wrong to think or say that.", "Knowing 1/6th of the attendees at something like a wedding is pretty good, honestly. You're not going to want to hang out with everyone at such a large event anyways, so all you need is a small group of people you know.\n\nINFO: Is your fianc\u00e9e ALSO socially anxious? (We anxious folks do tend to attract one another, so I think it's a question worth asking.) If so, is it possible that two events in one weekend is simply too much of a drain on her limited social battery? Is social anxiety something she has discussed with you as something she has, or any other disabilities that might impact her ability to do two consecutive large events on consecutive days?", "I understood that. None of it changes anything.", "Understood.  So by not going to the wedding with you, she is not supporting you and causing you pain.  Thats the point.  Not what you\u2019ve done for her.  You do those things because you want to.   You place importance on those actions.  She may not and place more value on other things that you do.  For example, I got in a fight with my husband because he didn\u2019t wash the dishes.  But he washed my car just moments before.  I didn\u2019t value the car washing as much as he did.  I felt unsupported and he felt unappreciated.  That could\u2019ve led to a bigger fight, but we talked it out.  Don\u2019t assume that your point of view is so clear that she must understand Without you saying it.   Good luck!", "Yes, I said NAH\u2026no assholes here.  And yes, talking to each other.  Again, what\u2019s with the score keeping?!?  The focus is to communicate.", "You made no mention of the deceased passing a year ago. And, honestly, why does it bother you that this man's life is celebrated multiple times? Ever consider that he may have had a positive impact on people who were unable to attend the preceding ones? He meant a lot to your fianc\u00e9e.

Thanks for keeping my mind in perspective on that, seriously. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e is outgoing with a very bubbly, confident personality in general. It\u2019s one of the things that first drew me to her: that she can walk into a room and just own it. She has a large circle of friends due to being involved in activities and hobbies for years that lend themselves to large groups and a lot of downtime to talk, plus in general she seemingly can make friends at the drop of a hat, or at least charm people into an enjoyable time together. That\u2019s not innuendo, I\u2019m simply bad with words. \n\nEven so, good point about the social battery from two events in a row as it\u2019s something to keep in mind, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s applicable in this situation", "Hence why I said it doesn\u2019t matter in light of the  result?

Most will be in jeans as they were the last two parties. \n\nI love that she\u2019s witty and clever. I love that she cares deeply about animals and activist causes. I love how driven she is in her line of work and how she takes the time to explain details about it to me when telling me about her day. She has an infectious laugh. She cares deeply for her mother and grandparents. She can watch movies or videos with horrible gross things or carry a spider outside no problem, but she will run from a bumble bee.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping me is that there is plenty of affection and care and laughter and a degree of support. I feel drained, tired of trying to explain but not feeling heard, but she promises she\u2019s listening so the least I can do is be patient with her. I can justify it the way a runner does during a runner\u2019s high", "It\u2019s amazing that you think you know the timeline of when everything starts! How do you know the bride or groom?", "Especially since I was continually getting asked by my cousin, my aunt and uncle, and the bride\u2019s maid of honor, if she would be attending. So admittedly me feeling pressured and her not seeming to care probably built up my frustration and hurt too", "It's definitely possible to be introverted and/or have social anxiety and still be a social butterfly-- it just means needing equal or more time to recharge after each interaction. I'm generally described as pretty personable, and people are sometimes surprised to learn that I'm an introvert with social anxiety when they've only seen me when I'm \"on\" and never seen me when I need to recover. But if this isn't something that's been an issue before, maybe that's not the case-- just bringing it up as a possibility. \n\nReally, I think the most important thing is to work on communication so you can talk about the overarching issue. According to your other comments, you feel undervalued and unsupported. *That* is what you need to be talking about *with her*, not talking down about her to your friends. \n\nFolks generally recommend premarital counseling even for couples who seem like the most solid couple in the world, simply because there are some skills that need to be *learned*-- and communication is a *skill.* Skills take *practice* to master. When you have social anxiety and thus have naturally avoided socialization when it's not necessary, that goes DOUBLE, because you've had less practice in communicating. I think both of you could benefit from premarital/couple's counseling so you can be on the same page and practice communication skills, and be able to discuss your feelings honestly with each other.", "NTA.  It\u2019s totally understandable why you would be annoyed by this.  She can make it, just requires more work.  The fact that she won\u2019t do the extra shows how much she values your feelings and opinions.   Think you should reevaluate your relationship.", "Welcome to reddit, lol!", "Yes, it certainly is variable in how it presents. Some people gain social energy like momentum as the energy of the party amps up, then afterwards crash or reaches an \u2018overfull battery\u2019 of sorts and need plenty of me-time after. Some have a very high threshold of when that battery explodes too.\n\nCouples counseling is something my therapist has mentioned before and I\u2019ve suggested to her, or even to sit with mine for a session or two, however she has many reasons she can\u2019t currently attend therapy. This is another thing ironically that counseling would help with. In the mean time I\u2019m working on my own communication and ability to connect and meaningfully articulate the true basis of my emotional responses. Like you said, it\u2019s a skill to improve on, even in the most apparently steady partnerships.", "Her refusal to go to counseling is worrying. The only thing you can do is try to work on your own communication, then, and try to see clearly and assess if she's really as dedicated to the relationship as you'd like her to be. If you feel undervalued, you're going to need to have some tough conversations before you get married either way-- even if she won't go to counseling, that conversation needs to be had."]}
