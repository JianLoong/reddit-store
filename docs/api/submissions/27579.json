We were like brothers growing up. The bride to be was a good friend of mine in elementary though we only recently reconnected. The wedding is an hour away on a Saturday. My fianc\u00e9e has a party in celebration of the passing of someone she knew for around a year the same Sunday, but I do totally understand that he provided a much desired father figure during the time she knew him. I explained to her multiple times and ways, plus to my best friend, how I felt she was abandoning me and being lazy as a fianc\u00e9e. In my defense about calling her lazy to my friend, I was drunk. Against me, I should have been in more control and been more tactful which I recognize that fully.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s family had two events to celebrate his life prior to now (November and December) and I made sure to show up to both with her.\n\nJust speaking logistically about the wedding: she could be home and asleep by midnight Saturday to still go on her party Sunday, and she has Sunday after 2pm and all of Monday to recover any lost sleep. But instead, she said no. Not only that, but at first she kept saying she had to think about it, but when it got to the 2 week mark for when we absolutely had to RSVP, she got angry I kept asking and didn\u2019t think about her party. Part of me understands this party is important to her, the rest of me is hurt and feels like she isn\u2019t putting any priority on what is important to me either. Especially because she hates dressing up so I feel like this is just a convenient excuse. Even though it\u2019s important to me, it hurts she doesn\u2019t care to adjust plans to support me.\n\nThe other night, after the RSVP timeframe, a mutual friend asked her what she was wearing to the wedding, and after she implied she was going but wasn\u2019t sure about her dress, I said (kinda bluntly) that she wasn\u2019t going. The mood got sour and tangled up, and afterward she got mad at me for saying she chose not to when she \u201ccouldn\u2019t go\u201d", "created_utc": 1695605348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16retid/aita_for_telling_our_friends_my_fianc\u00e9e_wont_be/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yikes. \n\nBut there is no reason at all that she can\u2019t go to the wedding. She will still get to go to the third memorial for this person she knew for one entire year.

It's perfectly fair to say she doesn't want to go to the wedding.

Bottom line she's not being forced by circumstances, she's choosing not to attend. You weren't wrong to think or say that.", "Knowing 1/6th of the attendees at something like a wedding is pretty good, honestly. You're not going to want to hang out with everyone at such a large event anyways, so all you need is a small group of people you know.\n\nINFO: Is your fianc\u00e9e ALSO socially anxious? (We anxious folks do tend to attract one another, so I think it's a question worth asking.) If so, is it possible that two events in one weekend is simply too much of a drain on her limited social battery? Is social anxiety something she has discussed with you as something she has, or any other disabilities that might impact her ability to do two consecutive large events on consecutive days?", "I understood that. None of it changes anything.", "Understood.  So by not going to the wedding with you, she is not supporting you and causing you pain.  Thats the point.  Not what you\u2019ve done for her.  You do those things because you want to.   You place importance on those actions.  She may not and place more value on other things that you do.  For example, I got in a fight with my husband because he didn\u2019t wash the dishes.  But he washed my car just moments before.  I didn\u2019t value the car washing as much as he did.  I felt unsupported and he felt unappreciated.  That could\u2019ve led to a bigger fight, but we talked it out.  Don\u2019t assume that your point of view is so clear that she must understand Without you saying it.   Good luck!", "Yes, I said NAH\u2026no assholes here.  And yes, talking to each other.  Again, what\u2019s with the score keeping?!?  The focus is to communicate.", "You made no mention of the deceased passing a year ago. And, honestly, why does it bother you that this man's life is celebrated multiple times? Ever consider that he may have had a positive impact on people who were unable to attend the preceding ones? He meant a lot to your fianc\u00e9e.

Thanks for keeping my mind in perspective on that, seriously. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e is outgoing with a very bubbly, confident personality in general. It\u2019s one of the things that first drew me to her: that she can walk into a room and just own it. She has a large circle of friends due to being involved in activities and hobbies for years that lend themselves to large groups and a lot of downtime to talk, plus in general she seemingly can make friends at the drop of a hat, or at least charm people into an enjoyable time together. That\u2019s not innuendo, I\u2019m simply bad with words. \n\nEven so, good point about the social battery from two events in a row as it\u2019s something to keep in mind, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s applicable in this situation", "Hence why I said it doesn\u2019t matter in light of the  result?

Most will be in jeans as they were the last two parties. \n\nI love that she\u2019s witty and clever. I love that she cares deeply about animals and activist causes. I love how driven she is in her line of work and how she takes the time to explain details about it to me when telling me about her day. She has an infectious laugh. She cares deeply for her mother and grandparents. She can watch movies or videos with horrible gross things or carry a spider outside no problem, but she will run from a bumble bee.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping me is that there is plenty of affection and care and laughter and a degree of support. I feel drained, tired of trying to explain but not feeling heard, but she promises she\u2019s listening so the least I can do is be patient with her. I can justify it the way a runner does during a runner\u2019s high", "It\u2019s amazing that you think you know the timeline of when everything starts! How do you know the bride or groom?", "Especially since I was continually getting asked by my cousin, my aunt and uncle, and the bride\u2019s maid of honor, if she would be attending. So admittedly me feeling pressured and her not seeming to care probably built up my frustration and hurt too", "It's definitely possible to be introverted and/or have social anxiety and still be a social butterfly-- it just means needing equal or more time to recharge after each interaction. I'm generally described as pretty personable, and people are sometimes surprised to learn that I'm an introvert with social anxiety when they've only seen me when I'm \"on\" and never seen me when I need to recover. But if this isn't something that's been an issue before, maybe that's not the case-- just bringing it up as a possibility. \n\nReally, I think the most important thing is to work on communication so you can talk about the overarching issue. According to your other comments, you feel undervalued and unsupported. *That* is what you need to be talking about *with her*, not talking down about her to your friends. \n\nFolks generally recommend premarital counseling even for couples who seem like the most solid couple in the world, simply because there are some skills that need to be *learned*-- and communication is a *skill.* Skills take *practice* to master. When you have social anxiety and thus have naturally avoided socialization when it's not necessary, that goes DOUBLE, because you've had less practice in communicating. I think both of you could benefit from premarital/couple's counseling so you can be on the same page and practice communication skills, and be able to discuss your feelings honestly with each other.", "NTA.  It\u2019s totally understandable why you would be annoyed by this.  She can make it, just requires more work.  The fact that she won\u2019t do the extra shows how much she values your feelings and opinions.   Think you should reevaluate your relationship.", "Welcome to reddit, lol!", "Yes, it certainly is variable in how it presents. Some people gain social energy like momentum as the energy of the party amps up, then afterwards crash or reaches an \u2018overfull battery\u2019 of sorts and need plenty of me-time after. Some have a very high threshold of when that battery explodes too.\n\nCouples counseling is something my therapist has mentioned before and I\u2019ve suggested to her, or even to sit with mine for a session or two, however she has many reasons she can\u2019t currently attend therapy. This is another thing ironically that counseling would help with. In the mean time I\u2019m working on my own communication and ability to connect and meaningfully articulate the true basis of my emotional responses. Like you said, it\u2019s a skill to improve on, even in the most apparently steady partnerships.", "Her refusal to go to counseling is worrying. The only thing you can do is try to work on your own communication, then, and try to see clearly and assess if she's really as dedicated to the relationship as you'd like her to be. If you feel undervalued, you're going to need to have some tough conversations before you get married either way-- even if she won't go to counseling, that conversation needs to be had.", "NTA No reason to make it look like she is going to your friends if she is telling you that she isn't. There is more to this story clearly though.", "NTA - she has time to attend both. Think hard before fianc\u00e9 becomes a wife", "NTA. While everyone grieves differently, there is a time where you really should put the needs of your partner before your own. I fully believe in paying your respects, and she did, twice, and so did you! There really isn\u2019t a true date/time conflict and she also has a recovery day for these events. \n\nI actually just attended a wedding with my boyfriend. Longtime friends of his from where he lived previously where getting married. They were all in a band together, the couple had us over at their house for four or five days while they worked on an event together again. When the newlyweds asked him to play during their ceremony, he was absolutely thrilled! And he killed it! This wedding meant the world to him. I did everything I could to make the experience better for him. Took a full day of preparation: did all the chores around our house, laundry, packed for him and myself, packed lunches and snacks for the seven hour car ride. I was up until 2am and we needed to be up at 5am. I was essentially sleep walking as we got ready to leave, but I hit the bullet and just did what I had to. Because it was for him and it was important. \n\nMy point being, relationships only work when you put the needs of your partner before your own. Especially as a soon to be wife herself, she should\u2019ve put you first. For you OP, your fianc\u00e9e not being able to go to something very important to YOU, and it sounds very doable from a logistics standpoint, is just not cool. If I was her, attending the THIRD memorial of someone I knew for a year (I understand if they were a father figure) would not supersede my fianc\u00e9 wanting me to attend his family members wedding. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just not a fan of that. Being selfless is an attractive quality and shows how much you really care for someone. What she did, in my opinion, was selfish.", "ESH", "INFO Why do you feel like you need support at this wedding? What do you need help with. It seems odd that a grown man is incapable of attending a party without their partner.", "It might be a cultural thing. In my country, we have the wake and the funeral around the time of the death and then we have events to celebrate their life at the marks of 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and then every year until the 5 year mark.", "I\u2019ll have to disagree with you. There are plenty of women who constantly bad mouth their boyfriends/husbands. Men are allowed to talk to their friends about their partners acting crappy too. Not like someone has to share every detail about a tiff or situation, but it\u2019s very frustrating to feel like an afterthought and that what\u2019s important to you doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s helpful to vent about things like that. A true partner puts the needs of their partner before their own. You\u2019re supposed to be selfless, not selfish.\n\nThe timeline is in fact relevant because she easily can go to both events, and has a recovery day. But a person she knew for a year shouldn\u2019t have superseded attending her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family members wedding. There is no true conflict and she was in fact, being lazy. Plus not giving him a definite answer before the RSVP date was incredibly rude of her! She\u2019ll see how that feels when it\u2019s her turn. \n\nI attended two weddings this summer. Both were from my boyfriends side. One was his cousins wedding back East that we traveled to. And we just got back from a wedding this weekend, two good friends of his and it was a good seven hour road trip. Both of the weddings he played violin and acoustic, respectively, during their ceremonies. He was so honored to do that! You think I\u2019d miss those weddings for an extremely unimportant event, such as the THIRD memorial for a father like figure I knew for one year? Absolutely not, and we\u2019re not even engaged yet. I did a ton of preparation for him so he could breeze through those ceremonies and not stress over the minute things. Because I\u2019m not lazy. \n\nA successful marriage also requires a wife that can put the needs of her husband first. But she pulls something like that? From a logistical standpoint it doesn\u2019t even make sense, it\u2019s absolutely doable.", "INFO: Please point out in the post or comments where I said I was incapable, then I will answer.", "The lazy comment mostly came from a moment of frustration around the fact she wasn\u2019t making a decision and my heated assumption that she just wanted to hang out with her friends instead of showing up with me. Which is fine. I said it in a moment of frustration and acknowledge she can make a choice in either direction. I also acknowledge I can feel like I play second fiddle to her being able to do this activity get-together with her friends again to celebrate the deceased; that feeling doesn\u2019t excuse the fact I name called her.", "Nope.\n\nAdults are capable of doing things separately when they have a reason to.\n\nIf you can't handle attending an event without your partner get therapy for your extreme codependency.", "Why do you feel like people who are engaged or married have to attend weddings together? I\u2019m 41, married, and honestly don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d think so. It\u2019s fun if both want to attend but why you\u2019d want to drag someone to an events they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to attend? What do you gain by doing that?", "Because she won't attend a fucking wedding?\n\nWhen you're talking shit about her?\n\nBecause she dared to have another commitment?\n\nYou're not even married yet and you're whining she isn't supportive enough because she's going to a MEMORIAL instead of a WEDDING. Generally speaking people are more likely to need support for grief than celebration, fyi.\n\nAnd instead of communicating like an adult, you're badmouthing her to your friends.. She should dump you for that alone.", "Why do you think a wedding is something you can't handle alone?", "Some cultures have multiple events during the mourning period. My dad's side has the funeral date, 40 day gathering, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 12 month gatherings.\n\nNot everyone is expected to go to all of them but close family definitely does.", "You\u2019re talking about your partner supporting you at the wedding in the post. That makes it a fair question to ask why you need support to go to a wedding.", "Yes, a party. It\u2019s a gathering of his friends, of which my fianc\u00e9e is obviously a part of, doing the same group activity they do weekly, but this time in his honor and memory. They\u2019re grieving. There is no time limit on this. Grief and joy do coexist often, as they should.\n\nBut even still it\u2019s absolutely considerably the more fun option over a wedding, and I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s crass to point that out.", "There is quite the gap between being incapable of doing something and feeling more secure knowing someone stands beside you.", "I\u2019m truly in awe of your stellar interpersonal relationships if you have never experienced or expressed any personal frustration concerning any of them", "You\u2019ve said this a dozen times. Where on earth did I say I cant go to the wedding alone? Is going together what I would have preferred? Absolutely. But I never once said or implied I was incapable of handling it.", "I appreciate the cultural knowledge. Can I ask the name of it or the practice? If there\u2019s a term", "Eventually she did, but very close to the deadline. \n\nIndeed it is. Best of luck to you", "There's also quite the gap between a fiancee and your mommy who needs to hold your hand through attending a wedding and yet that seems to have confused you.", "To my partner? Of course I have.\n\nTalking shit about my partner to other people? Literally never. I'm not a petulant child.", "Listening is one thing, actions are a completely different thing. How long has she been 'listening' and not doing. And isn't prepared to attend therapy with you.\n\nIt's not the same day, yes it will be a tiring weekend for her but you've offered her lots of support but if you're not feeling or seeing that being reciprocated what's the point in the relationship. \n\nI was initially y t a, but then read that it wasn't the same day and you seem to be supportive of her.\n\nWhen you called her lazy, is that because you don't feel she puts effort into you/your relationship and supporting you when you have big things happening? Rather than her being physically lazy.\n\nESH for me, she clearly doesn't want to attend the wedding but rather than be honest and say that she's ummed and ahhed.", "No, you seem to have made that mistake judging by your reactions. Enough. You have not bothered reading what I say, only spouting off based on what you believe and have decided about me. Thank you for your judgment, I only wish you had bothered to read and respond instead of attacking. I have yet to see a single comment from you that wasn\u2019t already brimming with the desire for a fight. Have a good day.", "Wow. I have heard it all.", "Sorry this is the first time you've encountered the concept of adult behaviour and healthy relationships.", "Whats healthy here exactly? The one sided support system? Where OP communicated that he lacks her support and her not giving a shit"]}
