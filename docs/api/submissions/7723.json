If you have a breed that already has this sort of behavior innate to its DNA (Belgian Malanois for example), then this is not only very safe and responsible to do, but OP would actually be an AH if they *didnt* do at least some training like this; because inevitably that dog would want to attack on its own.

Having a trained personal protection dog is as serious as owning and carrying any other weapon, and the situation you described is sort of equivalent to, say, drawing a concealed carry gun on an uncle trying to play a prank.

I'd be very proud of the dog, give him lots of rewards and let him know he did a great job. The dog didn't hurt anyone, just did his job like a good boy.

You shouldn't tell your dog to charge without identifying the threat.  What if the sound was a lost child, your mom, or another animal?

It happens. They are animals and independent thinkers. What happened when you have him charge and someone try\u2019s to defend themselves and kicks at your dog and they get bit? Sending your dog off leash? Bad idea. K9 handlers rarely send their dogs off leash to go after someone since we never know who may be around the corner. The dog doesn\u2019t know who we want them to bite if their are multiple people. That\u2019s why some cops get bit by K9s during foot pursuits. \nAlso just because someone is on your property doesn\u2019t mean you should just send your dog to chase after them.

I agree that OP's mom dropped the ball here, which is why my suggestion was around how to have the conversation about making sure the mom knows what safety measures (like communication) are her responsibility.", "I went back and you're right, it seems like it was just the uncle laughing. I'll stand by my argument that his laughing does not mean it shouldn't be taken very seriously, however. I'm glad there's evidence the uncle isn't traumatized, but he shouldn't be so light about playing this kind of prank on a property that has this kind of security.", "It's also completely dependent on country and probably state too.
