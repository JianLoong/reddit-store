I taught him to charge because its better to scare someone off than use him as a weapon to attack unless its a last resort.", "That\u2019d be true, IF OP was training the dog haphazardly themselves as a guard dog (it was my initial concern when I read the post). However, OP is being extremely responsible: they already stated they are working with *multiple* specialized guard dog trainers and have been doing so not only on an ongoing basis, but plan to keep up/maintain the training for the foreseeable future. If you have a breed that already has this sort of behavior innate to its DNA (Belgian Malanois for example), then this is not only very safe and responsible to do, but OP would actually be an AH if they *didnt* do at least some training like this; because inevitably that dog would want to attack on its own. Being taught commands, restraint, call-back, and what actually *is* and is *not* a threat, is ultimately going to keep people without ill intent safer(for obvious reasons) AND the dog safer (from getting put down after biting an innocent person), in the long run.", "Excellent. Any dog like that needs to be checked with security dog experts a few times a year and licensed. Once licensed, the second he does something wrong then you are in for a world of expenses and pain. Which is why you need to stay a top of the training", "Yeah the Uncle is definitely an asshole for jumping out of the bushes on a guy. I\u2019m not sure what the disability is, but could a massive scare trigger something? \n\nThe dog probably has some training. But would you trust it? No I wouldn\u2019t. I have friends that have actual \u201cattack dogs\u201d and they go away for 1-2 weeks training 1-2 times a year to ensure they have the correct licenses, training, reactions etc.", "And you know that..okay.", "And you had it charged at something when you had no idea what it was. If you like your dog the way it is then the charge is used as a last resort, not a first for when you are feeling a little spooked.", "Yeah, no. YTA. Not how dogs guard you, willingly.", "Training never really ends. I see it like language, once you stop using it you start to forget."]}
