Did his job great.", "NTA the dog did what he is trained to do and part of the reason your mom was on board with you getting the dog. \n\nHopefully it'll reach your uncle not to do stupid things like trying to scare someone when it's pitch black.", "NTA", "I do take him to specialists, I have a support worker that i work with through disabled services that basically helps me through stuff and he helped me get some trainers and a guard dog specialist, even one that comes to the home. Aside from that outside of that he is a very friendly dog, gental around children, small animals, other dogs, cats and any native wild life. I wanted to do my best and had the time so there was no excuse for me to slack on it.", "Don't think the dog is trained much at all. Neither is the uncle.", "and the uncle is not the one who is pissed about it", "Mentally 16, physically 45.", "Yes he is a companion but he is also a protector. I taught him to charge because its better to scare someone off than use him as a weapon to attack unless its a last resort.", "That\u2019d be true, IF OP was training the dog haphazardly themselves as a guard dog (it was my initial concern when I read the post). However, OP is being extremely responsible: they already stated they are working with *multiple* specialized guard dog trainers and have been doing so not only on an ongoing basis, but plan to keep up/maintain the training for the foreseeable future. If you have a breed that already has this sort of behavior innate to its DNA (Belgian Malanois for example), then this is not only very safe and responsible to do, but OP would actually be an AH if they *didnt* do at least some training like this; because inevitably that dog would want to attack on its own. Being taught commands, restraint, call-back, and what actually *is* and is *not* a threat, is ultimately going to keep people without ill intent safer(for obvious reasons) AND the dog safer (from getting put down after biting an innocent person), in the long run.", "Excellent. Any dog like that needs to be checked with security dog experts a few times a year and licensed. Once licensed, the second he does something wrong then you are in for a world of expenses and pain. Which is why you need to stay a top of the training", "Yeah the Uncle is definitely an asshole for jumping out of the bushes on a guy. I\u2019m not sure what the disability is, but could a massive scare trigger something? \n\nThe dog probably has some training. But would you trust it? No I wouldn\u2019t. I have friends that have actual \u201cattack dogs\u201d and they go away for 1-2 weeks training 1-2 times a year to ensure they have the correct licenses, training, reactions etc.", "And you know that..okay.", "And you had it charged at something when you had no idea what it was. If you like your dog the way it is then the charge is used as a last resort, not a first for when you are feeling a little spooked.", "Yeah, no. YTA. Not how dogs guard you, willingly.", "Training never really ends.

But if a dog kills someone on your comand, you might get away with a fine or a prison sentence but the dog - who doesn't really understand the situation or ramifications  - will get killed. \n\nUntil you understand this, you are not mature enough to be a dog owner.", "ESH. Your uncle for messing around in a way which could get a dog sicced on him, and you for unleashing the dog toward a target you didn't positively identify.

I hate \"pranks\" like this but he's not the one flipping out.", "Perfect then that's way I spaced it just saying if he tried to do it himself, I didn't scan the comments :)", "OP clearly spelled out upthread that the dog works with multiple specialists through the year on an ongoing basis, including both service dog training and guard dog training with experts. Not sure what else you're looking for.", "A prankster that both doesn't take it too far (which is subjective, I know) and, maybe just as importantly, understands the meaning of 'fuck around, find out', which this uncle seems to get, is okay in my book."]}
