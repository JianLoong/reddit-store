My ex wasn\u2019t a fancy girl, so none of it was worth a fortune, but lots of it were little handmade things (often one of a kind) that we bought at handmade markets on our travels around the country.\n\nShe picked up the things she had at my place pretty quickly and she insisted that I wasn\u2019t there when she did, which wasn\u2019t a big deal. But I did notice when I got back that she left behind her jewellery box full of trinkets. I promptly sent her a photo of the open box asking if she wanted me to either ship it or drop it off. I got back a really douchy response, something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t want anything that reminds me of the time I wasted with you\u201d. It was really hurtful given that it was a mutual split, but whatever.\n\nWhile non of the jewellery was worth much, I didn\u2019t want to throw it out so instead I gave the box to my little sisters (8 & 11) and told them to pick out whatever they liked, and I\u2019d donate the rest to the local shelter or something.\n\nMy 8 year old sister Julie really liked an opal butterfly necklace from the box. And by really liked it\u2026 she loves it. She hasn\u2019t taken it off since she put it on and keeps coming out with the cutest \u201cthank yous\u201d, she even made me a little thank you card at school with butterflies on them. It\u2019s no secret that I have a really soft spot for my sisters, and why wouldn\u2019t I - they\u2019re beautiful girls.\n\nYesterday my ex called me and her tone was completely different. She mentioned that she\u2019s been a real cow, and she\u2019s sorry. She then asked if she could have her jewellery box back after all. I told her she could, as I haven\u2019t dropped it off for donation yet, but the girls have been through it and took what they liked. She asked about the butterfly necklace. I told her that Julie had it now and loved it. Ex got really upset that I would \u201cgive away her things\u201d and asked if I could get my sister to return it.\n\nI actually went downstairs and saw Julie, happily playing with her little butterfly necklace on, and couldn\u2019t do it. I turned around, called Jane and told her she could have everything that was left back (the girls only took a few things), but the butterfly necklace wasn\u2019t coming back.\n\nShe called me an asshole and hung up, now I\u2019m getting abusive messages from her and her sister.\n\nSo\u2026.

Instead she said no. What were you supposed to do- keep it in case she changed her mind? That would be so sad to take the necklace away from this girl that really likes it. Don't put up with mean messages. She said no and she needs to live with that decision now.", "NTA, when someone asks if you want something and you say no (especially rudely) then that shit isn't yours anymore.", "NTA. Block her.

You have her the curtesy of asking if she\u2019d like them sent to her and she was snarky and said no. She should feel lucky you hadn\u2019t completely trashed or donated the entirety of her left behind jewelry and that she was able to get some of it", "NTA she will get over it or not. Whatever. Shes an ex for a reason", "You are NTA. You asked your ex if she wanted the jewellery box, and she said no. Your ex's actions and words show that in hindsight she regrets that choice, but that is too bad for her. You gave the majority of the items to the local shelter, as you promised. You even had permission to donate them.  Your sister was drawn to the opal necklace, and it is completely unreasonable for your ex to expect you to force your younger sister to return it. It belongs to your sister now, and should not be taken away from her because your ex was unwise.", "You reminded her of the jewelry and gave her the opportunity to claim it. She declined. Whether she regrets that or not isn't on you. NTA. And I think it's really sweet you offered first choice to your sisters. They'll cherish those gifts far more than your ex would.", "NTA.  She had her chance and instead of using a lighter, she used a flame-thrower.  Sucks to be her.", "NTA. Jane *has* been a cow and hasn\u2019t stopped. Keep the stupid box or not, but definitely block Jane and her sister!", "NTA. You don't need her toxicity in your life. Over jewelry ... that an ex gave her!? Geez. Block and move on.", "NTA\n\nShe was provided 2 opportunities to obtain the necklace. Once she said she didn't want it, and then you gave it away, it was gone.\n\nYou should NOT take it away from your sister just because your ex is a Beach. Block their numbers and move on with your life.\n\nSome people suck. Lesson learned.", "NTA.  She previously told you she didn't want any of it so giving it away was fair game.  That she changed her mind after the fact is on her.  You can return what's left but she should've asked for it in the first place if she wanted it all back.", "NTA\n\nYou offered. She declined.", "NTA - But you would be if you take that necklace back from your soster", "As a femaleqa1 I'm saying NTA     she stuffed around and stuffed up.  To bad her.  If it was important she should have gotten it sooner.", "NTA... she gave it away.", ">I promptly sent her a photo of the open box asking if she wanted me to either ship it or drop it off.

Don't be an unnecessary asshole. Congrats on dodging that bullet.", "I honestly couldn\u2019t take the necklace back from my sister. She\u2019s 8, and is really sentimental - she still has all the dolls we\u2019ve given her for birthdays and Christmases sitting on shelves in her room, looks after them, and won\u2019t allow anyone to throw them out. \n\nWorst thing is, and look I can\u2019t recall too clearly - but I\u2019m pretty sure the necklace was like $50 from a market in Orlando. I\u2019d honestly rather just go and track down another one than break Julie\u2019s heart like that.", "Yeah, I just couldn\u2019t do it. My little sister is really sentimental and just this gorgeous, happy kid. I always struggle to say no to her as it is, generally never do, and I just couldn\u2019t take away something that she loves so much.\n\nAs pretty as the necklace is, it\u2019s just a trinket from a market in Orlando. It\u2019s nothing worth disappointing an 8 year old over.", "You want to know the funny thing? Her sister ended up saying that it\u2019s the perfect thing to wear for my ex\u2019s festival outfit this weekend.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m supposed to break my sister\u2019s heart so my ex can accessorise better for an event where no one will even look too close.", "Aah okay. So she wasn't even apologising sincerely. \nShe was getting outfits ready for this festival and remembered the necklace. \nThis is a good life lesson for her. Once you throw something away, you can't run crying asking for it back. Especially when she knew it's been given away. What was she expecting after that message, that you'd keep it just in case she was gracious enough to talk to you again? \nNah. It sounds like your little sister appreciates the gift much more than she ever did.", "Not at all. She said she didnt want that stuff, so it was yours to deal with. Glad your sister likes it so much.", "NTA. She\u2019s FO and is now FO.", "once you have said you no longer want something then its no longer yours, that entire family is no longer your issue. THEY THE ASSHOLES, hope your daughter finds more joy in it than ur ex ever did \ud83d\ude01", "NTA.  You asked if she wanted the jewelry and she declined and gave an insult to boot.  You should have blocked her at that point.", "NTA\n\nShe left it behind, and when asked what she wanted you to do with it, she said she did not want them. So you started to get rid of them. \n\nNow she wants them back, but you don't have them all. You're willing to give her what you have, but you can't give her everything. And that is all her fault. She gave up ownership of them. \n\nYou don't owe her anything.", "Nta. Sounds like your ex has lost more than a necklace. You sound like a good dude and awesome brother.", "block her, yes it is that simple NTA", "YTA. You should've just mailed her property to her and not asked. She said she didn't want it in the heat of the moment.\n\nIt doesn't sound like it was even there very long so you don't have the excuse of abandoned property", "NTA you asked her if she wanted the box of jewellery, she said no. It\u2019s not your fault she suddenly changed her mind and now wants it back.", "She didn't want it so the items were gifted. She is too late. The necklace belongs to someone else. \n\nNTA\n\nBlock them.", "NTA you asked her she stated she didn't want them. Thats it. Are you meant to hoard her things for ever. She purposely left it, she explicitly told you after she didn't want them.  Dont take it off your sister, don't track a new one, don't pay for it either. Block her and her sister and look forward.", "NTA - Block them and don't give her anything.", "She clearly renounced possession of it. \n\nYou\u2019re wrong. \n\nDo you commonly ship things to people after they make it expressly clear they have zero interest in it? \n\nThat\u2019s really weird\u2026..", "I actually thought about doing that at first but the box was left in plain sight on my dresser where she took some other of her things, so I thought the polite thing was to ask instead of forcing it on her. I asked and got a no.", "Don't bother trying to replace it. \n\nYour ex said she did not want it, so you were free to trash it or do what ever with them. She has no claim to anything.", "Don\u2019t give in to the mean girls: block them. Definitely do not give back the necklace, she had her chance. Do not replace the necklace, she doesn\u2019t deserve it. Live your life well and keep on enjoying your sisters", "When he realized it was there the proper response was to mail her property", "It would've been best to send it so you didn\u2019t have direct contact. As it is, you contacted her ut of the blue after what sounds like a messy breakup and of course she was hostile. You escalated by not giving her time to cool down but instead gave her jewelry to your little sisters. \n\nAlmost like you knew she'd say she didn't want it when she was upset that you contacted her.", "And tell the parents that if the ex shows up claiming the necklace (or tries to confront Julie directly) DON'T GIVE IT TO HER!!\n\nNTA", "It was no longer her property\u2026..she literally renounced ownership. \n\nYou\u2019re wild.

You planned to give it to your sisters", "That\u2019s not the case \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI texted her because she left something behind that was quite obvious and I wasn\u2019t sure if that was deliberate or not.\n\nWhen she said she didn\u2019t want it, instead of throwing it out, I offered it to my sisters.\n\nI appreciate your assumption but you\u2019re wrong there.", "Damn\n\nI really hope you stretched before reaching that far. You could really hurt yourself doing that.", "The assumption comes because you should've known she wouldn't want to hear from you and you texted her anyway", "Sorry I\u2019m not a mind reader and have manners.", "Looks like we found your ex\u2019s burner account", "LMAO \ud83d\ude02 OR HER SISTER FOR SURE"]}
