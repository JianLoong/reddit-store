My ex wasn\u2019t a fancy girl, so none of it was worth a fortune, but lots of it were little handmade things (often one of a kind) that we bought at handmade markets on our travels around the country.\n\nShe picked up the things she had at my place pretty quickly and she insisted that I wasn\u2019t there when she did, which wasn\u2019t a big deal. But I did notice when I got back that she left behind her jewellery box full of trinkets. I promptly sent her a photo of the open box asking if she wanted me to either ship it or drop it off. I got back a really douchy response, something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t want anything that reminds me of the time I wasted with you\u201d. It was really hurtful given that it was a mutual split, but whatever.\n\nWhile non of the jewellery was worth much, I didn\u2019t want to throw it out so instead I gave the box to my little sisters (8 & 11) and told them to pick out whatever they liked, and I\u2019d donate the rest to the local shelter or something.\n\nMy 8 year old sister Julie really liked an opal butterfly necklace from the box. And by really liked it\u2026 she loves it. She hasn\u2019t taken it off since she put it on and keeps coming out with the cutest \u201cthank yous\u201d, she even made me a little thank you card at school with butterflies on them. It\u2019s no secret that I have a really soft spot for my sisters, and why wouldn\u2019t I - they\u2019re beautiful girls.\n\nYesterday my ex called me and her tone was completely different. She mentioned that she\u2019s been a real cow, and she\u2019s sorry. She then asked if she could have her jewellery box back after all. I told her she could, as I haven\u2019t dropped it off for donation yet, but the girls have been through it and took what they liked. She asked about the butterfly necklace. I told her that Julie had it now and loved it. Ex got really upset that I would \u201cgive away her things\u201d and asked if I could get my sister to return it.\n\nI actually went downstairs and saw Julie, happily playing with her little butterfly necklace on, and couldn\u2019t do it. I turned around, called Jane and told her she could have everything that was left back (the girls only took a few things), but the butterfly necklace wasn\u2019t coming back.\n\nShe called me an asshole and hung up, now I\u2019m getting abusive messages from her and her sister.\n\nSo\u2026.

Instead she said no. What were you supposed to do- keep it in case she changed her mind? That would be so sad to take the necklace away from this girl that really likes it. Don't put up with mean messages. She said no and she needs to live with that decision now.", "NTA, when someone asks if you want something and you say no (especially rudely) then that shit isn't yours anymore.", "NTA. Block her.

You have her the curtesy of asking if she\u2019d like them sent to her and she was snarky and said no. She should feel lucky you hadn\u2019t completely trashed or donated the entirety of her left behind jewelry and that she was able to get some of it", "NTA she will get over it or not. Whatever. Shes an ex for a reason", "You are NTA. You asked your ex if she wanted the jewellery box, and she said no. Your ex's actions and words show that in hindsight she regrets that choice, but that is too bad for her. You gave the majority of the items to the local shelter, as you promised. You even had permission to donate them.  Your sister was drawn to the opal necklace, and it is completely unreasonable for your ex to expect you to force your younger sister to return it. It belongs to your sister now, and should not be taken away from her because your ex was unwise.", "You reminded her of the jewelry and gave her the opportunity to claim it. She declined. Whether she regrets that or not isn't on you. NTA. And I think it's really sweet you offered first choice to your sisters. They'll cherish those gifts far more than your ex would.", "NTA.  She had her chance and instead of using a lighter, she used a flame-thrower.  Sucks to be her.", "NTA. Jane *has* been a cow and hasn\u2019t stopped. Keep the stupid box or not, but definitely block Jane and her sister!", "NTA. You don't need her toxicity in your life. Over jewelry ... that an ex gave her!? Geez. Block and move on.", "NTA\n\nShe was provided 2 opportunities to obtain the necklace. Once she said she didn't want it, and then you gave it away, it was gone.\n\nYou should NOT take it away from your sister just because your ex is a Beach. Block their numbers and move on with your life.\n\nSome people suck. Lesson learned.", "NTA.  She previously told you she didn't want any of it so giving it away was fair game.  That she changed her mind after the fact is on her.  You can return what's left but she should've asked for it in the first place if she wanted it all back.", "NTA\n\nYou offered. She declined.", "NTA - But you would be if you take that necklace back from your soster", "As a femaleqa1 I'm saying NTA     she stuffed around and stuffed up.  To bad her.  If it was important she should have gotten it sooner.", "NTA... she gave it away.", ">I promptly sent her a photo of the open box asking if she wanted me to either ship it or drop it off.

She gave up ownership of the box when she sent you that message. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, she had her chance, but also her two faced actions do her no credit.

Don't be an unnecessary asshole. Congrats on dodging that bullet.", "I honestly couldn\u2019t take the necklace back from my sister. She\u2019s 8, and is really sentimental - she still has all the dolls we\u2019ve given her for birthdays and Christmases sitting on shelves in her room, looks after them, and won\u2019t allow anyone to throw them out. \n\nWorst thing is, and look I can\u2019t recall too clearly - but I\u2019m pretty sure the necklace was like $50 from a market in Orlando. I\u2019d honestly rather just go and track down another one than break Julie\u2019s heart like that.", "Yeah, I just couldn\u2019t do it. My little sister is really sentimental and just this gorgeous, happy kid. I always struggle to say no to her as it is, generally never do, and I just couldn\u2019t take away something that she loves so much.\n\nAs pretty as the necklace is, it\u2019s just a trinket from a market in Orlando. It\u2019s nothing worth disappointing an 8 year old over.", "You want to know the funny thing? Her sister ended up saying that it\u2019s the perfect thing to wear for my ex\u2019s festival outfit this weekend.\n\nThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m supposed to break my sister\u2019s heart so my ex can accessorise better for an event where no one will even look too close.", "Aah okay. So she wasn't even apologising sincerely. \nShe was getting outfits ready for this festival and remembered the necklace. \nThis is a good life lesson for her. Once you throw something away, you can't run crying asking for it back. Especially when she knew it's been given away. What was she expecting after that message, that you'd keep it just in case she was gracious enough to talk to you again? \nNah. It sounds like your little sister appreciates the gift much more than she ever did."]}
