I have been estranged from my mother and her side of the family for 10 yrs. Since I stopped speaking to my mother, my sister and her family stopped speaking to me. She has two daughters. One I've never met and the other who is 15yrs old, I haven't seen in over 10 years. My mother was extremely abusive to only me. My sister was the favorite. I'm fine with not having any relationship with her. My father still has a relationship with her and his grandchildren. Every year, except the year I stopped talking to them, I've been asked, by my father, to wrap Christmas presents that are from him to my sister and her children. I've done it every year, even though there's no reason that he couldn't do it himself. But this year I refused. I've been in therapy and learned to set boundaries. He freaked out. He called me names. I said I didn't want to wrap presents for people that are practically strangers to me, that I have no relationship with. Especially my sister, who treated me just like my mother did. He said I felt sorry for my self, but I don't. I've been very happy having no relationship with them. \n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1703385395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pli2b/aita_for_refusing_to_wrap_christmas_gifts_for_my/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is a full grown adult and if he doesn\u2019t want to wrap stuff he can go buy gift bags. It\u2019s not your responsibility to wrap his gifts for people who mistreated you.", "NTA. Even leaving out how you feel about the rest of the family, he's a grown-up and he can wrap his own damn presents.  It seems kind of abusive for him to make you do it.", "NTA. That's unspeakably cruel on his part. Wth is he thinking, & maybe the recipients have thought he wrapped them the past decade?? Ugh, I'm so sorry he even called you names over thus abusive thing he's trying to force you into doing yet again. That's just awful, & I absolutely **get it,** coming from a 'broken' family myself. None of this is okay, & it's devastating there's been zero recognition how your mother was to you. And sorry, but your sister sucks. Again, none of this is okay. I hope you find some kind of joy despite this ongoing crap in your immediate environment, & I'm so glad you're settling boundaries & in therapy. And congrats on NC with that mother of yours. I went 17 blissful years with mine, & still NC with my brother. Our growing up years were so different, we may as well have not been raised by the same parents. Good luck", "YTA!! your elderly father is asking you to do a favour for him, not your sister or her kids but for him! as someone who has recently lost thier father i would love to sit and wrap presents for him and just spend time with him!! he's not asking you to buy them, deliver them or even speak to your sister he is asking for your help, you have done so every year so why say no now? did you atleast talk to him, in advance and let him know how this make you feel no, you did this for years with no issueband then just decided no I don't want to do it this year which is ridiculous!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
