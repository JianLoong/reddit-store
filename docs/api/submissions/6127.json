This year, we were invited to her parents' house for dinner and her whole extended family was going to be there as well. She was excited and said it would be the perfect time to introduce me to her family.\n\nAt her parents' house, everything was going great. I even became friends with her grandfather over playing chess and backgammon (I'm quite good at them both). And honestly it was going better than I thought was possible.\n\nNow I don't drink. I don't smoke. I never have and probably never will. I don't have anything against alcohol, and we do have alcohol over at our house because my gf needs a glass of wine sometimes (she was into drinking and partying before). I just don't want to be the one drinking. Mostly because it never got to me.\n\nMy gf's older brother (29M) turned out to be a real drinker. He kept offering me a drink the whole time we were there with different excuses like a toast, dinner, as a complementary to food, to get the party started, etc. I politely said I didn't drink every single time.\n\nDuring dinner, where wine was being served, he offered to pour me a glass of wine and I refused once again. This time, in front of everybody he asked me what my problem with alcohol was, if I was a recovering addict or super religious or what my deal was. \n\nI said I preferred not to drink and smoke. That they both can have consequences in one's long-term health and I simply never really got into it. He said I was being a major buzz kill, that he had gotten tired of trying to make me feel welcome, and that I should have just accepted the drink and let go. \n\nMy girlfriend was going to go ballistic on him (I saw her eyes and boy was she mad) but I took control of the whole situation and said I already felt quite welcome and that everyone had been absolutely lovely. I also said I didn't need to drink to feel that.\n\nAfter dinner, I was going up in our room to get the gifts we had brought and I ran into him again. He said I was not better than anyone by practicing my abstinence from alcohol, that I was boring, and a terrible woman who had made his sister's life a boring hell.\n\nDid I do something wrong by not accepting his attempts?", "created_utc": 1672515488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1001ukk/aita_for_for_saying_no_to_alcohol/", "score": 827, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not offer me alcohol again.\"", "NTA - her brother has issues and it has nothing to do with you. Keep politely saying no Everytime he asks. It makes him look like an idiot pushing boundaries in front of everyone", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t need to drink to be interesting, and the fact that he took offense at you not drinking is a major show of insecurity on his part.", "NTA. He definitely is jealous that you have \"control\" over your decisions about your health. He's projecting his insecurities onto you. Although, if there were toasts going on, you could have offered to toast with a non alcoholic drink, like water, or something to show that you were engaging more or something.\nBut that's also not necessary...you are not in the wrong here and you handled the situation very well.", "NTA - never the A for turning down drugs, because that is what alcohol is. Your gf brother is the A for continuously trying to force it on you. I bet no one else even really noticed.", "NTA but you should have let your girlfriend handle her brother. If you are giving an accurate account of what you said, it could come off a little \"better than\" in some circles. Still NTA though.", "You are in no way the asshole, honestly it's her brother. You made it clear: you don't want to drink. He kept bugging, even though you declined the offer several times. No one should be forced to do anything they do not want to do. The brother is also wrong for claiming you are a terrible woman for simply not drinking alcohol. I seriously wonder what kind of logic that is. So no, you are in no way the asshole and the brother should have stopped the very second you said you don't want to drink.", "NTA - the brother sounds like one of those that\u2019s become dependent on alcohol and feels validated being around others that drink and judged by those that don\u2019t. \n\nI probably wouldn\u2019t recommend a comment that alcohol effects long term health, mostly because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any studies that actually support it. I\u2019ve read studies that say an occasional drink doesn\u2019t create health issues, some say an occasional drink can be a part of a healthy diet.

He clearly wanted you to indulge but I can only imagine it was to make himself feel better. Your body, your rights etc. If he needs alcohol to not be boring, that\u2019s on him.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to drink and you showed an incredible amount of grace by diffusing the situation. I would have let your girlfriend tear him a new asshole at that point. What an idiot.", "NTA I drink plenty but am more than able to respect other people boundaries with not drinking, unlike your GFs brother. Everyone enjoys things different ways and it would be better if people could be more respectful of that. Just because you don't drink doesn't make you boring.", "\"i am sorry that my life choices made you feel uncomfortable with your guilt and insecurities. you should have got it the first time and spared everyone your petty speech. now go back to bottle because you look thirsty as fuck and watch your mouth\"\n\ndef NTA", "NTA. I have never come across anyone who didn't accept I don't care for alcohol as enough of an excuse to not drink. Nobody even gave a crap in high school or college.", "NTA.\n\n There's a particular stage of alcoholism where the alcoholic still has to cling to the idea that they are drinking *with* someone, or *for* some special occasion, or whatever -- and yet is dependent enough on alcohol that they'll drive people away and ruin occasions by insisting that everything be about drinking.  It's more painful for those who love the alcoholic, and more annoying/funny/depressing for everyone else, because it's so obvious.\n\nIt's also quite a way from rock bottom -- rock bottom can only come when the person either drinks alone, or abandons the company of regular people for the company of drinking buddies.  So you're going to be stuck with BIL for a bit.\n\nBut, it sounds like in general, the visit went really well!", "I think it\u2019s extremely obvious, even to you, that you\u2019re not TA.", "NTA at all!

Its poison not a necessity to live \n\nGuys like him take it as judgement of their choices when you choose different, its not rational or logical but yeah \ud83d\ude44\n\nBasically he is saying he cant have a good time and be interesting without alcohol, sad isnt it", "You just ran into someone with a drinking problem! And oh yeah, NTA.", "NTA. You said no several times\u2026not sure why he was so relentless about it. Some people just don\u2019t drink. Unless you were being super judgmental (which it doesn\u2019t sound like you were) then he needs to back off.", "NTA.  Doesn't matter what reasons you or anyone else have for drinking, there should never be a problem with saying no to it.\n\nNo wonder your GF was set to rip him a new one.  Even as a drinker, pushers are the absolute worst and won't let you just have a good time on your own terms.\n\nHis behaviour is way out of line for pushing, not to mention asking why you don't drink because sometimes that does out a person as someone who has struggled with drink in the past (or is still struggling.)", "NTA Clearly he has some issues he needs to work through. What he said says more about him than he does you. I also have never had a drink or smoked my entire life. Good on you for standing up for yourself and not taking the bait in a very classy way might I add. Loved your response to him!", "NTA. Brother has an alcohol problem and is pressuring your because of it. He is the AH in this situation. A person with the understanding of social cues, would have dropped the subject after your first or second refusal.", "NTA. It probably would\u2019ve been good had you let your GF tell off her brother.", "NTA and you handled the situation beautifully by saying you felt welcome.", "NTA.  He\u2019s an alcoholic.  The end.\nEdit: alcohol is just a symptom of alcoholism.  There\u2019s causes and conditions behind his drinking.  Your not drinking is putting up a mirror to his dis-ease.", "NTA. You didn't try to stop anyone else from drinking, you just didn't want to drink yourself.", "Sounds like a pervert who wants to get you drunk.", "NTA. I don\u2019t drink either. If people push me or tell me I\u2019m a buzz kill I become a buzz kill by explaining why I don\u2019t drink (my parents were alcoholics and my father got violent while drunk). That shuts them up usually. \n\nIt sounds like he has a real problem.", "Anyone who gets mad that someone doesn\u2019t drink is insecure and/or an alcoholic. I have a friend who doesn\u2019t drink because even after half a drink she starts getting a headache and says it just isn\u2019t worth it, so when I have a party I buy her a pack of Diet Coke because that\u2019s what she likes. I don\u2019t drink much at all, but I will occasionally (0-4) drinks a month, and i don\u2019t care at all that she doesn\u2019t want to even when I am. It literally has no effect on me and we still have fun\n\nEdit to add NTA", "NTA, \nSome people who are aware that they themselves have a drinking problem, cannot tolerate someone who has the self control not to go for a drink under peer pressure. To them it's almost like seeing someone who is better than then and makes them feel cheap.. it's completely their mental attitude and not something you need to accommodate. \n\nI don't drink or smoke either and frankly it has impacted the level of socializing I can do. But I don't like the idea of succumbing to peer pressure and get into unhealthy habits which can lead to addiction. Has it lost me potential friends ? Yes. But it has also shown be the best friends who respect my decisions and they add more joy to my life. \n\nStay strong and that guy can shove his bottle where the sun don't shine", "NTA - you said your gf used to party -- maybe he's noticed her change and since he can't control himself he is projecting or thinks you are nefariously controlling her.  As long as the rest of the family was great, no worries.  If you have any concerns - ask your gf to check in with her parents to check temps or you do a follow-up thank you card/call/email to her mom/dad for hosting you.  Don't mention the drinking, he made an ass out of himself, let them see you are above it and it didn't ruin your time meeting them...", "NTA  No means no!  If someone declines a drink, it's almost always none of your business, so move along or offer them a non-alcoholic beverage.\n\nYou can toast with soda, water, juice, whatever.  This just pisses me off!", "NTA\n\n100% his issue. I\u2019m not an alcoholic, but if I offer a beer when I\u2019m getting one and they say no, guess what? I don\u2019t get them one and carry on my merry way.", "NTA.  Of course. You have every right not to drink.  And I think the way he asked you WHY you weren\u2019t drinking was unnecessarily confrontational. What if your really were a recovering alcoholic?  What if you had been on medication and didn\u2019t want to discuss it?  It was none of his business.  I\u2019m glad to hear in the comments that many people have not had the experience of being peer pressured into drinking.  I do still have friends that also feel they need to keep offering their guests alcoholic beverages no matter how many times they are told no.", "Nta. I'm pregnant, so can't currently drink, but have had a rocky past with drugs and alcohol anyway, so try to keep drinking to a minimum (family events, birthdays etc) and I keep very little in the way of booze in my house. My family came to my husband and I for Christmas this year, I told them they were welcome to bring their own booze, but we wouldn't be providing any. They came without any booze, because they respect my boundaries.  Its not hard to respect someone's boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't have to participate in any \"tradition\" you don't want to, especially ones that can actually be very dangerous. If you did have an addiction problem or a health problem, that could've been terrible. I don't drink because of a bad family history and my husband's family has never ever made me feel like I'm ruining the party by abstaining (because I'm not ruining the party).
