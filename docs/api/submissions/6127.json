This year, we were invited to her parents' house for dinner and her whole extended family was going to be there as well. She was excited and said it would be the perfect time to introduce me to her family.\n\nAt her parents' house, everything was going great. I even became friends with her grandfather over playing chess and backgammon (I'm quite good at them both). And honestly it was going better than I thought was possible.\n\nNow I don't drink. I don't smoke. I never have and probably never will. I don't have anything against alcohol, and we do have alcohol over at our house because my gf needs a glass of wine sometimes (she was into drinking and partying before). I just don't want to be the one drinking. Mostly because it never got to me.\n\nMy gf's older brother (29M) turned out to be a real drinker. He kept offering me a drink the whole time we were there with different excuses like a toast, dinner, as a complementary to food, to get the party started, etc. I politely said I didn't drink every single time.\n\nDuring dinner, where wine was being served, he offered to pour me a glass of wine and I refused once again. This time, in front of everybody he asked me what my problem with alcohol was, if I was a recovering addict or super religious or what my deal was. \n\nI said I preferred not to drink and smoke. That they both can have consequences in one's long-term health and I simply never really got into it. He said I was being a major buzz kill, that he had gotten tired of trying to make me feel welcome, and that I should have just accepted the drink and let go. \n\nMy girlfriend was going to go ballistic on him (I saw her eyes and boy was she mad) but I took control of the whole situation and said I already felt quite welcome and that everyone had been absolutely lovely. I also said I didn't need to drink to feel that.\n\nAfter dinner, I was going up in our room to get the gifts we had brought and I ran into him again. He said I was not better than anyone by practicing my abstinence from alcohol, that I was boring, and a terrible woman who had made his sister's life a boring hell.\n\nDid I do something wrong by not accepting his attempts?", "created_utc": 1672515488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1001ukk/aita_for_for_saying_no_to_alcohol/", "score": 431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do not offer me alcohol again.\"", "NTA - her brother has issues and it has nothing to do with you. Keep politely saying no Everytime he asks. It makes him look like an idiot pushing boundaries in front of everyone", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t need to drink to be interesting, and the fact that he took offense at you not drinking is a major show of insecurity on his part.", "NTA. He definitely is jealous that you have \"control\" over your decisions about your health. He's projecting his insecurities onto you. Although, if there were toasts going on, you could have offered to toast with a non alcoholic drink, like water, or something to show that you were engaging more or something.\nBut that's also not necessary...you are not in the wrong here and you handled the situation very well.", "NTA - never the A for turning down drugs, because that is what alcohol is. Your gf brother is the A for continuously trying to force it on you. I bet no one else even really noticed.", "NTA but you should have let your girlfriend handle her brother. If you are giving an accurate account of what you said, it could come off a little \"better than\" in some circles. Still NTA though.", "You are in no way the asshole, honestly it's her brother. You made it clear: you don't want to drink. He kept bugging, even though you declined the offer several times. No one should be forced to do anything they do not want to do. The brother is also wrong for claiming you are a terrible woman for simply not drinking alcohol. I seriously wonder what kind of logic that is. So no, you are in no way the asshole and the brother should have stopped the very second you said you don't want to drink.", "NTA - the brother sounds like one of those that\u2019s become dependent on alcohol and feels validated being around others that drink and judged by those that don\u2019t. \n\nI probably wouldn\u2019t recommend a comment that alcohol effects long term health, mostly because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any studies that actually support it. I\u2019ve read studies that say an occasional drink doesn\u2019t create health issues, some say an occasional drink can be a part of a healthy diet. With everything, moderation.", "NTA. \n\nPurely anecdotal, but in my experience sobriety makes people uncomfortable, especially if they\u2019ve ever tossed around the idea that they may have a problem. \n\nI think his behavior is a perfect example of why someone may not want to explore alcohol.", "NTA. He clearly wanted you to indulge but I can only imagine it was to make himself feel better. Your body, your rights etc. If he needs alcohol to not be boring, that\u2019s on him.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to drink and you showed an incredible amount of grace by diffusing the situation. I would have let your girlfriend tear him a new asshole at that point. What an idiot.", "NTA I drink plenty but am more than able to respect other people boundaries with not drinking, unlike your GFs brother. Everyone enjoys things different ways and it would be better if people could be more respectful of that. Just because you don't drink doesn't make you boring.", "\"i am sorry that my life choices made you feel uncomfortable with your guilt and insecurities. you should have got it the first time and spared everyone your petty speech. now go back to bottle because you look thirsty as fuck and watch your mouth\"\n\ndef NTA", "NTA. I have never come across anyone who didn't accept I don't care for alcohol as enough of an excuse to not drink. Nobody even gave a crap in high school or college.", "NTA.\n\n There's a particular stage of alcoholism where the alcoholic still has to cling to the idea that they are drinking *with* someone, or *for* some special occasion, or whatever -- and yet is dependent enough on alcohol that they'll drive people away and ruin occasions by insisting that everything be about drinking.  It's more painful for those who love the alcoholic, and more annoying/funny/depressing for everyone else, because it's so obvious.\n\nIt's also quite a way from rock bottom -- rock bottom can only come when the person either drinks alone, or abandons the company of regular people for the company of drinking buddies.  So you're going to be stuck with BIL for a bit.\n\nBut, it sounds like in general, the visit went really well!", "I think it\u2019s extremely obvious, even to you, that you\u2019re not TA.", "NTA at all!

Its poison not a necessity to live \n\nGuys like him take it as judgement of their choices when you choose different, its not rational or logical but yeah \ud83d\ude44\n\nBasically he is saying he cant have a good time and be interesting without alcohol, sad isnt it", "You just ran into someone with a drinking problem! And oh yeah, NTA.", "NTA. You said no several times\u2026not sure why he was so relentless about it. Some people just don\u2019t drink. Unless you were being super judgmental (which it doesn\u2019t sound like you were) then he needs to back off.", "NTA.  Doesn't matter what reasons you or anyone else have for drinking, there should never be a problem with saying no to it.\n\nNo wonder your GF was set to rip him a new one.  Even as a drinker, pushers are the absolute worst and won't let you just have a good time on your own terms.\n\nHis behaviour is way out of line for pushing, not to mention asking why you don't drink because sometimes that does out a person as someone who has struggled with drink in the past (or is still struggling.)", "NTA Clearly he has some issues he needs to work through. What he said says more about him than he does you. I also have never had a drink or smoked my entire life. Good on you for standing up for yourself and not taking the bait in a very classy way might I add. Loved your response to him!", "NTA. Brother has an alcohol problem and is pressuring your because of it. He is the AH in this situation. A person with the understanding of social cues, would have dropped the subject after your first or second refusal.", "NTA. It probably would\u2019ve been good had you let your GF tell off her brother.", "NTA and you handled the situation beautifully by saying you felt welcome.", "NTA.  He\u2019s an alcoholic.  The end.\nEdit: alcohol is just a symptom of alcoholism.  There\u2019s causes and conditions behind his drinking.  Your not drinking is putting up a mirror to his dis-ease.", "NTA. You didn't try to stop anyone else from drinking, you just didn't want to drink yourself.", "Sounds like a pervert who wants to get you drunk.", "NTA. I don\u2019t drink either. If people push me or tell me I\u2019m a buzz kill I become a buzz kill by explaining why I don\u2019t drink (my parents were alcoholics and my father got violent while drunk). That shuts them up usually. \n\nIt sounds like he has a real problem.", "Anyone who gets mad that someone doesn\u2019t drink is insecure and/or an alcoholic. I have a friend who doesn\u2019t drink because even after half a drink she starts getting a headache and says it just isn\u2019t worth it, so when I have a party I buy her a pack of Diet Coke because that\u2019s what she likes. I don\u2019t drink much at all, but I will occasionally (0-4) drinks a month, and i don\u2019t care at all that she doesn\u2019t want to even when I am. It literally has no effect on me and we still have fun\n\nEdit to add NTA", "NTA, \nSome people who are aware that they themselves have a drinking problem, cannot tolerate someone who has the self control not to go for a drink under peer pressure. To them it's almost like seeing someone who is better than then and makes them feel cheap.. it's completely their mental attitude and not something you need to accommodate. \n\nI don't drink or smoke either and frankly it has impacted the level of socializing I can do. But I don't like the idea of succumbing to peer pressure and get into unhealthy habits which can lead to addiction. Has it lost me potential friends ? Yes. But it has also shown be the best friends who respect my decisions and they add more joy to my life. \n\nStay strong and that guy can shove his bottle where the sun don't shine", "NTA - you said your gf used to party -- maybe he's noticed her change and since he can't control himself he is projecting or thinks you are nefariously controlling her.  As long as the rest of the family was great, no worries.  If you have any concerns - ask your gf to check in with her parents to check temps or you do a follow-up thank you card/call/email to her mom/dad for hosting you.  Don't mention the drinking, he made an ass out of himself, let them see you are above it and it didn't ruin your time meeting them...", "NTA  No means no!  If someone declines a drink, it's almost always none of your business, so move along or offer them a non-alcoholic beverage.\n\nYou can toast with soda, water, juice, whatever.  This just pisses me off!", "NTA\n\n100% his issue. I\u2019m not an alcoholic, but if I offer a beer when I\u2019m getting one and they say no, guess what? I don\u2019t get them one and carry on my merry way.", "NTA.  Of course. You have every right not to drink.  And I think the way he asked you WHY you weren\u2019t drinking was unnecessarily confrontational. What if your really were a recovering alcoholic?  What if you had been on medication and didn\u2019t want to discuss it?  It was none of his business.  I\u2019m glad to hear in the comments that many people have not had the experience of being peer pressured into drinking.  I do still have friends that also feel they need to keep offering their guests alcoholic beverages no matter how many times they are told no.", "Nta. I'm pregnant, so can't currently drink, but have had a rocky past with drugs and alcohol anyway, so try to keep drinking to a minimum (family events, birthdays etc) and I keep very little in the way of booze in my house. My family came to my husband and I for Christmas this year, I told them they were welcome to bring their own booze, but we wouldn't be providing any. They came without any booze, because they respect my boundaries.  Its not hard to respect someone's boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't have to participate in any \"tradition\" you don't want to, especially ones that can actually be very dangerous. If you did have an addiction problem or a health problem, that could've been terrible. I don't drink because of a bad family history and my husband's family has never ever made me feel like I'm ruining the party by abstaining (because I'm not ruining the party).

He sounds like he\u2019s actually an alcoholic and you declining alcohol made him feel called out on it.", "NTA. Ignore that schmuck.", "NTA. Noone should ever make someone feel weird for not wanting to drink. If they say no once, that's it.", "Ya, you did something really wrong, you showed him someone can have a great time, and feel welcome AND enjoy conversation and a shared meal without needing alcohol to do it.\n\nNTA", "NTA - and this is him projecting his concerns about his drinking on you", "NTA.  If he isn't an alcoholic, he's well on his way to being one.", "NTA! No one is EVER wrong for refusing alcohol. it seems that her brother is projecting on to you bc he has an alcohol problem", "Wow.  This pisses me off so much.  When I first got really into AA at the age of 29,  I often encountered guys like this when out with my friends.  In fact, I made someone cry because I kept refusing his drinks, and had to eventually say to him, \"You need to accept it when a woman says 'no.'\" Maybe try that tactic with her brother.  It could make him realize how inappropriate and controlling he is being.  Also, congrats on enjoying social life without needing to drink!", "NTA - This is what alcoholics have done to me my whole life.  I don't drink.  Sorry OP, but this will be an issue your whole life.  Stupid drinkers can't stand the thought that you might \"look down\" on them because they are drinking when you don't.  I didn't use to feel that way, but after the way I've been treated by these asshats, I do now.", "Nta. I am absolutely one to refuse any alcoholic drink unless it\u2019s in my own house or with my brother. I have no problem whatsoever with others drinking around me but I have been in your shoes when they question my decision on what my deal with alcohol is because they just can\u2019t accept my no for an answer. next time because trust me there will be one let the sister go off on him.", "NTA but next time I\u2019d watch your drink because people like that often go to tricking people into consuming what they want and looking smug that they \u2018broke\u2019 you.", "NTA.  Not at all.  I can\u2019t believe how he behaved.  I think you acted wonderfully and he will look like the asshole he is to everyone involved.  \n\nIf it comes up AGAIN, I would politely let him know you don\u2019t drink, and aren\u2019t planning to discuss it with him further.  It\u2019s none of his damn business.", "Also that he's REALLY jealous of either his sister or OP. Or possibly both", "\"What's your problem with be respectful to guests?! The only one who is being unwelcoming and stuck up is you.\"", "People often behave weirdly when it comes to commenting on food and drink. (Here in France, wine is considered practically non-alcoholic!)  It's extremely impolite, but ascribing it to alcoholism assumes facts not in evidence.", "Easy NTA and you know it.", "Um, no lol. He\u2019s just actually crazy. NTA.", "Nta. He\u2019s definitely projecting his insecurities about his alcohol consumption on you.", "NTA!! Clearly we know who TAH is here! Why is he shaming you for not drinking?? He has deeper issues you shouldn\u2019t worry yourself about!", "NTA. What kind of immature fuck would try to pressure someone into drinking? This isn\u2019t 9th grade. Glad you are respectful of other\u2019s desire to drink/smoke. Since your GF enjoys drinking. Don\u2019t really feel like it is unreasonable for other people to be respectful of your choices. BTW- good for your GF for taking up for you.", "Definately NTA but he is.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this perfectly, her brother sounds insecure and like he\u2019s projecting his issues in to you.\n\nPushing people to do anything they don\u2019t want to is lame and he should be embarrassed", "NTA. I love a wine but I have friends who don\u2019t drink. It\u2019s no big deal. \n\nSounds like this guy was looking for a reason to try to bully you and you\u2019ve handled it with class. Well done.", "Nope, he\u2019s just feeling the alcoholic and needs to protect his fragile ego.\n\nNTA, I\u2019m sure the rest of the family knows he\u2019s projecting and thinks nothing untoward you.", "NTA. Whether to drink or not is a personal choice and trying to force it on someone is an awful thing to do", "NTA, brother sounds like a actual creepo", "op=NTA\n\nyour GF's brother is the A-H.\n\nAnd you don't have to be \"exciting\" by his measurements, but by your GF's assessment and she seems to be supportive of you.\n\nYou handled everything with amazing grace.  Stand your ground and don't give in to sibling-pressure.", "As another non-drinker yeah this happens all the time. Some people take it as a personal affront that you don\u2019t enjoy your life the same way that they do, get defensive, assume you must be secretly judging them and become angry at you for something they made up in their own head.\n\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate but you\u2019re NTA. If you ever figure out a way to handle people like that, please let me know. So far saying \u201cI\u2019m not judging anyone I just don\u2019t want to\u201d only gets met with \u201cpsssh, yeah, *sure* you\u2019re not, not to my face.\u201d\n\n\nThey can\u2019t comprehend someone not enjoying alcohol and the reason not being something to do with them. It\u2019s very weird.", "NTA. He is being the AH. But know this, while he focused his dissatisfaction towards you, it is actually everything to do with himself. He has a relationship with alcohol and to justify it, he assumes everyone else should too. Except he knows his isn't healthy so by you not drinking, he is projecting his own judgment onto you. Users prefer to be surrounded by users and they assume people will judge them for how much they use. They'll avoid or end relationships with people they've known forever when those people stop using. It's not you. Please don't take it personally.", "NTA sounds like the brother is an alcohol and felt threatened by you simply and politely declining.  No one should EVER push alcohol onto someone who declines, or demand a reason why from them.  If he ever tries it again, I'd ask \"why is it so important to you that I drink?\"", "NTA \n\nwell done for standing up against him. proud of you", "Maybe get him The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous for his next gift", "This. I used to drink, but honestly I never liked the high. So I quit by my early 20s and the primary reason that I quit completely instead of just not getting drunk is that peers wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Every night was expected to be one of the nights when I would take a shot socially and then if one, why not 3. So it became easier socially to just stop all together. But that then led to the issues OP is having, where people didn\u2019t like that I didn\u2019t drink. In my experience it was usually due to their own insecurities about their relationship with alcohol.", "Especially if you have no medical reason to back it up.", "Don't forget that OP has no way to understand why anyone would *want* to drink.\n\nI wouldn't read too much into their choice of language \u2014 it's like asking a blind person to explain why someone would acquire a painting.", "NTA. People who push alcohol usually have drinking problems.  I don' t drink for lots of reasons, one being medical.  I hate having alcohol.pushed on me. I told one person \"Sure I can drink but I hate going to the ER afterwards, so no thanks.\"", "NTA. As someone who doesn't drink purely because I don't like the taste (and I can taste alcohol in even the weakest of drinks). People get very, VERY offended by it sometimes especially if they're a heavy drinker with an unacknowledged drinking problem. It's so engrained in American society to drink (and that drinks = fun) that people assume anyone who's sober by choice must be a recovering alcoholic or has been affected by alcoholism.\n\nDon't bother with these sorts of people. Just remain firm. It might not be your style but I'm fairly aggressive (and a bit mean) when pushed and it's worked out well for me in a family full of controlling, pushy people. Being a woman, it's often necessary.", "NTA- The World: ... Her brother: I don't have a problem, YOU have a problem! The World: When did problems show up in this conversation? You trying to tell us something, mate?", "NTA it's your choice to avoid toxins like tobacco and alcohol. People who pressure non-drinkers to have alcohol often have a drinking problem. Stick to your preferences. It's not 'better' to not drink but it's best to be healthy. I don't drink either but neither do a lot of people in my work so it isn't an issue.", "NTA I didn't even have to open the post, If ANYBODY keeps trying to force you into drinking alcohol, they are almost always a complete asshole if they keep pushing after you say no", "NTA. Your gf's brother is giving major red flags. Just like how you're not better than anyone for not drinking, he isn't better than anyone for drinking. It's a personal choice and if anything, he killed the mood by insisting you to drink. Champagne could be replaced with sparkling water, wine with grape juice and so on if he really wanted you to drink and not look out of place.", "NTA. I have friends who don't drink. My partner doesn't drink. We've never pressured them to drink.

No religion or recovery takes a play in my decisions. It\u2019s just not something I\u2019m into and want to spend my money on.
