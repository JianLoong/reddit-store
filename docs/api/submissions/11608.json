My brother has 2 kids (ages 10 and 4) from a previous marriage. While going through the divorce, his ex wife moved the kids out of state, several states away. He then also moved (not to the same state as the kids), met his current wife, and moved in with her. They then relocated again, and bought a 4 bedroom house. I came to visit while the kids were there, and became aware that the kids were sleeping on air mattresses in the living room. I was told that the bedrooms were allocated like this: brother and SILs bedroom, SIL's office, brother's office, and a gym. The kids did not have rooms there apparently. I confronted my brother about it and he seemed embarrassed and explained that because the custody agreement previously forced him to go to the kids for the visits (the courts decided the youngest was too young to be forced to travel) that they hadn't planned on them being at their house often, if at all. I was annoyed, but felt like maybe his embarrassment meant he would fix that. After all, the agreement had changed so the kids would be with him for 3 or 4 large chucks of time during the year, including basically all summer.\n\nIt's about a year later, and brother and SIL just had a baby. They also are again relocating due to a job change, this time back near where we all live. We've all been so happy about that change. Well, they just had an offer accepted on a much-larger 6 bedroom home.\n\nMy parents went to tour it with them and innocently asked which rooms would be whose. They were told the rooms were to go like this: Brother and SILs room, Nursery, Brother's office, SIL's office...and 2 guest bedrooms.\n\nMy mom clarified \"aren't the kids getting rooms?\" And my SIL got huffy and said it was important to her to have guest rooms for her family to visit, and that they wouldn't be comfortable staying in kid bedrooms. My mom turned to my brother and was like....your kids need rooms. My SIL continued to \"explain\" and my mom interrupted her and again directed her statement at my brother. He said he agreed and an argument ensued.\n\nI will be seeing them in a few days and this has been eating at me. I love all my nieces and nephews and this feels like some of them are being treated like second class citizens in their parent's home.\n\nGenerally speaking, I think it's my brother's job to ensure the kids are getting the treatment they deserve. But I can't possibly stand by and watch this happen and act like it's okay. Silence feels like condoning to me. But I also don't know if speaking my mind would be the best move.\n\nWIBTA for bringing it up to them again, knowing they are already fighting about it?", "created_utc": 1678092831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jtfr1/wibta_if_i_33f_confronted_my_brother_35m_and_sil/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of the times we don\u2019t get to see the ugliness and neglect that goes on behind closed doors. You\u2019re starting to see it. Your brother is the kind of guy who is good to his kids as long as things are good wither their mom. The minute that relationship begins to break down, not only does he discard the woman, but also the children. \n\nHe may have fought for custody to save face or to avoid paying child support.

And I would feel horrible for doing that to them.", "This right here is my complete fear. When the divorce was happening and it looked like he may not get a ton of custodial time he was angry with the system and stopped fighting it for a minute. I told him that he had to fight.

It's better than not fighting at all.\n\nHe told me that worse case scenario \"one day they will come to me and ask why I wasn't around, and I'll tell them how it happened\". I was bewildered.

Then I slept on a shitty foam mattress in my sisters room. Then I finally got a \u201croom\u201d that was actually part of the attic and no bigger than a bathroom, and had no ac and not much insulation since it wasn\u2019t meant to be a livable room. They stuck the mattress on a bed frame in there, a cheap window AC, and a fan and called it good.

I\u2019m glad OP is stepping up, it puts a trauma on children like nothing else and takes year and years to un do.

I\u2019m Not saying that it wouldn\u2019t change, I\u2019m just bringing up the possibility because it seems like the step mother rules that house with an iron fist, and she obviously doesn\u2019t care about the kids and their comfort. Those children need to come first, their needs come before anything else, and what they need is an advocate. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve already spoken up for them, same with your mum.

But 6 bedrooms and none for their kids is actually repulsive.\n\nNo idea what your kids have, if that's a treat for them, and I won't speculate. But what's a once off is not suitable for an ongoing living situation with their parent. Many treats become neglect when they are a pattern, and systemic lack of privacy or personal storage space I'd not a treat like an occasional sleepover.", "I don't think that dude is naive. I believe he knows the knows the kids will feel bad about it but he doesn't a give a shit.
