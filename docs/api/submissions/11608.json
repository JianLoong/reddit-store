My brother has 2 kids (ages 10 and 4) from a previous marriage. While going through the divorce, his ex wife moved the kids out of state, several states away. He then also moved (not to the same state as the kids), met his current wife, and moved in with her. They then relocated again, and bought a 4 bedroom house. I came to visit while the kids were there, and became aware that the kids were sleeping on air mattresses in the living room. I was told that the bedrooms were allocated like this: brother and SILs bedroom, SIL's office, brother's office, and a gym. The kids did not have rooms there apparently. I confronted my brother about it and he seemed embarrassed and explained that because the custody agreement previously forced him to go to the kids for the visits (the courts decided the youngest was too young to be forced to travel) that they hadn't planned on them being at their house often, if at all. I was annoyed, but felt like maybe his embarrassment meant he would fix that. After all, the agreement had changed so the kids would be with him for 3 or 4 large chucks of time during the year, including basically all summer.\n\nIt's about a year later, and brother and SIL just had a baby. They also are again relocating due to a job change, this time back near where we all live. We've all been so happy about that change. Well, they just had an offer accepted on a much-larger 6 bedroom home.\n\nMy parents went to tour it with them and innocently asked which rooms would be whose. They were told the rooms were to go like this: Brother and SILs room, Nursery, Brother's office, SIL's office...and 2 guest bedrooms.\n\nMy mom clarified \"aren't the kids getting rooms?\" And my SIL got huffy and said it was important to her to have guest rooms for her family to visit, and that they wouldn't be comfortable staying in kid bedrooms. My mom turned to my brother and was like....your kids need rooms. My SIL continued to \"explain\" and my mom interrupted her and again directed her statement at my brother. He said he agreed and an argument ensued.\n\nI will be seeing them in a few days and this has been eating at me. I love all my nieces and nephews and this feels like some of them are being treated like second class citizens in their parent's home.\n\nGenerally speaking, I think it's my brother's job to ensure the kids are getting the treatment they deserve. But I can't possibly stand by and watch this happen and act like it's okay. Silence feels like condoning to me. But I also don't know if speaking my mind would be the best move.\n\nWIBTA for bringing it up to them again, knowing they are already fighting about it?", "created_utc": 1678092831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jtfr1/wibta_if_i_33f_confronted_my_brother_35m_and_sil/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As in, will the kids be using them and there be an expectation that guests will not be invited while the kids are there (or have it be expected that guests will sleep on the couch if needed)? Or will the kids be sleeping in the living room still so the guest rooms can be kept pristine?\n\nI understand it would be hard for you to know this at the moment but certainly something to find out before unloading on your brother about the room situation.", "NTA - maybe the bio mom had good reasons to get her kids away from your brother. A lot of the times we don\u2019t get to see the ugliness and neglect that goes on behind closed doors. You\u2019re starting to see it. Your brother is the kind of guy who is good to his kids as long as things are good wither their mom. The minute that relationship begins to break down, not only does he discard the woman, but also the children. \n\nHe may have fought for custody to save face or to avoid paying child support. I highly doubt his new wife wants him paying hundreds (potentially thousands) toward kids she doesn\u2019t even deem good enough to have a room in her home.\n\nPersonally, I think the more you guys get involved the higher the risk of you being cut off. You can\u2019t win with people like this.", "This is definitely my other fear. My only avenue to see the kids is through my brother. Their mom doesn't like our family and does not allow us any access to the children while in her care. I once messaged her asking if I could send the kids Christmas gifts and she said \"only in the form of Amazon gift cards\"...so it's icy at best.\n\nIf my brother and/or SIL gets really mad at me and cuts me off, I lose complete access to the kids. And I would feel horrible for doing that to them.", "This right here is my complete fear. When the divorce was happening and it looked like he may not get a ton of custodial time he was angry with the system and stopped fighting it for a minute. I told him that he had to fight. Fighting and losing shows your kids that you wanted them. It's better than not fighting at all.\n\nHe told me that worse case scenario \"one day they will come to me and ask why I wasn't around, and I'll tell them how it happened\". I was bewildered. I said \"that's best case scenario. Worse case scenario they don't care enough to even ask the fucking question\". I was called an AH then by my family for being so hard on him.", "They're being treated worse than guests...  Guests get bedrooms.\n\nNTA", "Big time , I'd find Jesus in a cave and say bro check this out, I'd find the lost city of Atlantis and hand out fliers saying y'all gotta check this shit out. Tell the mother , he doesn't deserve kids if he's Gunna treat them like guests that won't leave.", "I've definitely debated talking to my brother alone. He's the one I'm most angry with. He's their dad. It's his job to make sure they are loved and cared for. But  I think it's clear my SIL is calling the shots.\n\nI'm honestly trying really hard to give her the benefit of the doubt that she's just really selfish, and doesn't understand how much this will hurt the kids. And if that is the case, maybe I could reason with her?", "Very true, I thought maybe hearing someone else agreeing, or hearing a more thought out reason as to why it was important could tip some kind of scale. But I also agree that it may do nothing but piss everyone off even more.\n\nI got the impression that they will sleep in those rooms, but would not be allowed to keep anything (like toys and decor) in there of their own. They would be treated like any other guest visiting.", "Sounds like SIL doesn't like her husbands kids either... why do people gotta be like this? NTA OP, you help those kids however you can... and the Amazon gift card thing sounds sketchy, how old are the kids again?", "I would bet the kids wouldn't even receive any gift cards you gifted them.", "The reason some get away with this is because they are surrounded by people who don't hold them accountable.  My ex told everyone,  his family,  new wife, anyone who would listen that I kept his kids from him. He claimed he didn't fight for them because he didn't want a court battle. Yet, took me to court over 10 times over money!\nYour guy needs a person who brings reality to the situation.  Whatever happens, YOU maintain a loving,  supportive relationship with them, it will pay off in the end", "Talk to your brother. He's your best shot. He knows how to talk to his wife.", "Especially true when they see that her child will have their own room and they don't", "Does your brother WFH or is his office more like a man-cave?", "This is an exact case of kids from first marriage who would be forgotten. The 4yo is still young, but kids can still feel when they're unwanted. Your brother has a new family and doesn't want the \"ex\" kids to disturb it. Have they come to visit at all since the baby came? How did they react at the new baby?", "trust me I know what you mean. I'm the villain in his story but I never do get answered when I ask how can I keep her away from.him if he doesn't even ask? he hasn't seen her since she was a year old she's going on 3 this year. it's not the mothers responsibility to make sure the father has a relationship with the kid it's the father responsibility to maintain the relationship", "They haven't visited yet since she was born, they did do a facetime to \"meet\" the new baby. They will visit for the first time in a month or so.\n\nThis isn't the first time the kids have been pushed aside like this. They weren't invited to the wedding. At the time it seemed regrettable but understandable? It was a very small (15 people) wedding during COVID, and the kids weren't being allowed to travel to their dad.\n\nFor the new baby's baby shower, the SIL's family kept talking to my brother and SIL about how to do baby things like they were first time parents. I pointed out more than once that my brother was an experienced dad that knew these things. That didn't go over well. She comes from a very religious family that reeeeally isn't okay with divorce. I assumed at the time that my SIL had been going along with it to save face with her family. I didn't think SHE was pretending he was a first time dad. I guess I was wrong."]}
