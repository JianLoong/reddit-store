I remember getting a breast exam done by a man when I was 18 and had specifically asked for a woman and was a little miffed about it. It was super awkward but honestly he was super professional and it was over so fast\n\nOne thing though, female doctors go through the same exact training that male doctors go through. They have to be taught the entire anatomy too, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t learn it just because they already have it.

On the other hand, because a male gynecologist doesn\u2019t have firsthand experience having female anatomy, his expectations won\u2019t be clouded by preconceived notions about how you\u2019re supposed to feel based on his personal experience. Instead, he\u2019s forced to rely on only objective, evidence-based medicine.\n\nFurthermore, in medicine, we look at the body academically. I couldn\u2019t think of any of my patients as attractive or \u201csexy,\u201d even if I wanted to, and that\u2019s coming from someone with an otherwise-dirty mind and high libido. Just not possible. I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say that we - meaning medical professionals as a whole, and not just me - are not thinking about our patients like that. In a way, it\u2019s instinctual compartmentalization. This also goes for females treating males - they\u2019re looking to see if I have testicular cancer, not how big my dong is.\n\nRegarding judgment\u2026 On one hand, it\u2019s not second nature to trust someone of the opposite sex with your reproductive health.

From the doctors I know, unless they are particularly weird by time you end medical school the idea that they are getting off from seeing your private parts, or are attracted to you in the context of a medical exam, is unrealistic.

I've had family members get serious medical problems undiagnosed just because male doctors have blamed it on hormones, menstruation, and stress.

It's just with something as serious as your health you shouldn't have to compromise and hope that your male doctor will believe you/understand what's wrong. \n\nAt the end of the day, this is about comfort as well.
