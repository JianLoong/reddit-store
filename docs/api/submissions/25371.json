{"id": 25371, "submission_id": "15zo4vi", "title": "AITA for leaving out my vegan sister-in-law out of the family BBQ?", "selftext": "My spouse and I got a house and we both have relatives living nearby, including our respective siblings and parents. Last year we decided to host a huge backyard BBQ party and invited friends and family. However, my spouse's sister kinda ruined it. She's a hardcore vegan, so we'll call her \"Erin\" (IFKYK). Everything out of her mouth was something vegan related and everyone was pretty annoyed and mostly avoided her. If she wasn't going on about ethics, it was about health. She was basically shaming our older friends/relatives for not wanting to take care of their bodies. She told my father that his diabetes is from eating animal fat. At one point, she even left to go to the store and returned with a ridiculous amount of VEGAN frozen patties (and bread and other items) and demanded we cook them up and serve them as an option. So to be nice, we cooked one pack....no one touched them. She was absolutely tiresome. Other than Erin, the BBQ was a hit. So we did it again this summer. \n\nWhen it comes to Erin, my spouse and I disagree. I do not engage with her and she knows I'm not fond of her. He and his parents think she is harmless, whereas my family frikkin hates her guts. I did not know this until recently, but Erin got into it with one of my cousins \"Mary\" last year who tried to be friendly with Erin since Mary used to be vegan in the past but gave it up when it made her sick. Apparently Erin attacked Mary calling her \"ignorant\" and insisted she was \"doing it wrong\". \n\nSo I did not want Erin at this year's BBQ at all. But I did not want to cause any drama. I didn't even bring this up to my spouse. I knew that Erin was gonna go on vacation for a whole week this month, so as soon as she left, I set up the BBQ on the Saturday right before she's supposed to come back (Sunday). Everything went perfectly as planned. However, Erin saw the photos on Facebook and was PISSED. She found out from my spouse that I chose the date so she texted me that I am evil, heartless, and a bully for leaving her out. She also brought up other really personal things to attack me so I ended up blocking her. Erin has since ran to my spouse and her parents to complain constantly and won't let it go. \n\nSo what could I have done differently? Was I wrong to schedule the BBQ when she was out of town?\n\nEDIT 1: A little more context. Erin absolutely knows her behavior is annoying. My mother straight up told her what we were all thinking when she made that diabetes comment to my dad. Erin also does not handle criticism well. If I went and told her that she was not welcome to the BBQ this year, she would do the same thing that she is doing now and complain to her parents and my spouse and likely show up to the BBQ anyway. I believe planning the BBQ while she was away was the best thing to do. Because she can't prove that I did it on purpose. And as far as my spouse and my other in-laws know, it was just a coincidence and not my intention at all. So no one knows I did this.

I don't blame you at all for scheduling the BBQ when she was not able to attend due to how she behaved at the last one and the fallout caused amidst the rest of the attendees.\n\nAnswering questions about veganism if people ask? Fair. Asking for a pack of vegan patties to be cooked so then they have something to eat and it also offering people the opportunity to try them if curious? Also fair. Being obnoxious? Not something you should have to tolerate.", "NTA\n\nBut, I agree with some posters that you need to lay down the law with her. \n\nShe cannot ruin other's good time by preaching her religion, cannot try to shame them, is not allowed to give health advice or in any way insult them. \n\nYou will provide a vegan alternative, but she is not allowed to be pushy, demanding or shame others if they don't want to partake. \n\nIf she breaks the rules, she's no longer welcome at your home. The End. \n\nThat way, everyone knows their boundaries and the consequences. Just as you would treat any child that is acting like an ass when around the adults to get attention. Which is exactly what this is.", "Erin sounds exhausting and I do not blame you for not wanting her there. I don't understand people who thrive on making others miserable. NTA for avoiding her tantrums this year.\n\nHowever, I don't think you can do this every year without them catching on that this is intentional, and I could foresee Erin pretending to be unavailable just to catch you out.\n\nI wonder what would happen if you hire someone to come and playact being a friend of yours who would then babysit Erin. Wherever she goes, her babysitter goes too. Every time she criticizes and bullies others, her keeper loudly exclaims something like \"Erin! I can't believe you would be so rude!\". Give her all the attention she wants but make it as unpleasant for her as she is making all your other guests.\n\nIn a reasonable world you would be able to simply not invite her, but Erin isn't being reasonable.", "No, I think you are right to put up boundaries, and if she cannot respect you and your house, then she has no right to be there. I am all for if you want to be vegan, but you don\u2019t need to go out and harass others if they are not. Your house your rules.", "NTA\n\nErin has been given the opportunity to grow up and realize what she says and how she acts can have negative consequences. While she was actually correct, it was also extremely self centered of her to think you scheduled the BBQ this weekend because you knew she would be gone instead of it just working out that way.\n\nHowever, this is not your BBQ. It is you and your spouse's BBQ so you need to make sure going forward you are both on the same page. Right now hopefully your spouse will back you after all that Erin has said. If not you two need to get on the same page going forward or stop throwing the BBQ.", "NTA, your intention is to avoid conflict, but without your husband\u2019s support, you\u2019ll always be stuck with this erin problem.

Lol.\n\n> Was I wrong to schedule the BBQ when she was out of town?\n\nYes. It's understandable why you did, but ultimately you were avoiding having a direct confrontation with Erin and now things have escalated. \n\nYour spouse needs to step up and take control of the situation. You both ned to be nicer, and she needs to stop being a buzzkill at family gatherings. Let her know in the future, if she doesn't act right, she won't be invited. \n\nYou can also consider having two parties, one for your family and friends, and the other for his side of the family.

However instead of having a conversation with your partner you were sneaky behind his back.", "Not popular but ESH. Her more than you. \n\nBeing vegan does not make you an expert on health. She needs to stop giving out quasi-medical advice and she needs to zip it. \n\nInviting her and not catering to her is not the right thing to do, nor is deliberately planning the next BBQ for when you know she can\u2019t attend. You can pretend all you like that it was accidental, but is anyone honestly believing that?\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for excluding her, but maybe next time she attends a family function, have a squirt bottle on hand hand and spritz her while barking NO! anytime she starts to vegan vent.", "ESH.  \n\nShe\u2019s insufferable.  I am also a vegan, but I\u2019m aware that no one else gives a shit that I am a vegan.   \n\nYou planned the BBQ when you knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to come on purpose (even though she doesn\u2019t know/can\u2019t prove that it was on purpose).

Man a good BBQ charred, garlic soaked broccoli, tomatoes, zucchini, peppers, carrots, potatoes, Brussels sprouts... \n\nNo one eats a balanced meal at a BBQ so just enjoy the veg and shut up.

Sometimes you just have a party pooper, and there's no way around that. At least everyone knew what they were in for with her. And this might make \"me\" the asshole, but my move woulda been to invite them after they left. \n\nI mean, I have to dock you points and call a spade a spade- you knew when theyd be outta town and you planned around that. If your spouse knew, they kinda don't get to judge and oughta be on your side here even if they didn't agree because they were complicit? But its still your party and you get to make that choice, so everyone kinda sucks.\n\nThe other side of the equation is its a bbq, its not like its a set in stone thing either.\n\nYou're getting an everyone sucks here for doing the asshole thing for an understandable reason. At this point regroup your spouse and get them on your side by pointing out that if this person sucks enough to get you to take such drastic measures, then if you've never been super unreasonable before you need them to see what led to you taking such a drastic approach. The rest of the family? Deal with 'em later. Whatever. Get your house in order to have a unified front first.", "YTA. You purposely excluded her and tried to do it behind her back as well.

Being a very picky eater, this would\u2019ve been an Oscar-worthy performance but it was unnecessary because like you, she\u2019s not an ass-butt.  Thanks for that.", "Agreed.\n\nI am not vegetarian, and got hassled by a person at a mutual friend's party about this. They were pointing out lovely vegetarian food people had brought, to convince me it was fine. I was very amused to tell them one of the dishes they recommended to me was the one I had made. \n\nJust because I eat meat does not mean I only eat meat.\n\nIt is fine to recommend stuff, but hassling someone at a party is just antisocial.", "Vegans always mention that they are vegan but at least you are doing it for a good reason. You have my respect. Vegans are fine the people we need to judge are the ones who order well done steak", "Everyone grow old, but not everyone grows up : /", "Your SO needs to lay down the law with her and his parents. She sounds awful. NTA", "I don't see why she would tell anyone that. Doing so would just be looking to needlessly start drama.", "If they are people who don\u2019t make their whole personality about being vegan, then yeah they are cool and I\u2019d gladly make them food that fits in their diet", "Found Erin, folks", "Looks like you referring to things that were made in the edit from OP.", "Yea but he didn\u2019t know op picked that so she couldn\u2019t come. I understand why she did. Thats why i said justified ah", "Actually wrong she literally said I didn\u2019t bring this up to my spouse. So no she didn\u2019t", "Yikes. That's pretty messed up. You lied to your spouse to exclude their sister. You need to grow up and deal with things like an adult. You are just lying to everyone rather than having difficult conversations. That is AH behavior.\n\nEdit: I'm changing my judgment to YTA based on the answer to my question.", "I feel like if anyone had an issue with the date and that Erin would miss it they should\u2019ve brought it up. They all knew she was out of town and didn\u2019t ask if it could be rescheduled for Erin because (most likely) no one wants her there", "Nobody should be judged for what they choose to eat other than people who get well done steak. Waste of meat", "Do you think it's appropriate to lie to your spouse about your plans to exclude one of their family members from an event?", "And? That\u2019s context", "Read the updated bit ^^", "She didn't really lie to her spouse though. She just didn't go over all the reasons why she chose the date she did. The spouse was fully within their power to veto the date and choose a day Erin could have made it but didn't do so.", "And in case it wasn't obivious, the information that OP added via an edit was not available to me when I first posted.", "That update does not help your case. You are perfectly content lying to everyone. I don't care how annoying she is you are an AH. I hope everyone finds out you are lying. They deserve to know.", "It's a lie of omission. OP lied and then planned a party around the lie. People in marriages typically have a don't lie to each other policy.", "Tbf she didnt lie she just omitted the truth. Also Erin and everyone around her knows she\u2019s insufferable so i don\u2019t think an explanation for not inviting her is really needed. I disagree with your opinion, OP is NTA", "She planned a date around an omission. There is always going to be dates that certain members of the family can't make. That's life. She doesn't owe anybody a BBQ. And it's only really a lie if she wouldn't come clean to her husband on the reasoning which doesn't seem to be the case. Her husband already knows how she feels about Erin.", "I'm of the opinion that lies of omission are still lies. If I found out my spouse lied to me in such a calculating fashion I would be upset. This is why I think OP is the AH. I'll take an annoying pushy vegan over a liar any day.", "OP needs to grow up and tell her spouse that the date was intentional to exclude their sister. They can use that as an opportunity to set limits and make a plan to deal with this like adults. Do you think OP can go the rest of their life using lies and manipulation to exclude people? Seriously, I cannot get behind this childish cowardly behavior.", "Jesus this is a huge overreaction. This is not lies and manipulation. Get over yourself. She chose a date among many dates she could have chosen that had an additional benefit for her. The husband could have easily vetoed this date. He didn't. The wife *has* told the husband her feelings about Erin and they've gone all but ignored. As such she found an easy solution that had no difference than if she just flat out didn't invite Erin but at least this way Erin could have had a bit of grace. You are way overreacting to this. Are you Erin?", "For one, OP manipulated the situation to get their desired outcome. Not having Erin there. Secondly, just because you think that lies of omission don't count as real lies doesn't mean everyone believes this. \n\nHere are the definitions of [manipulate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manipulate) since you don't seem to understand what it means."]}
