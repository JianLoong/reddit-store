{"id": 25371, "submission_id": "15zo4vi", "title": "AITA for leaving out my vegan sister-in-law out of the family BBQ?", "selftext": "My spouse and I got a house and we both have relatives living nearby, including our respective siblings and parents. Last year we decided to host a huge backyard BBQ party and invited friends and family. However, my spouse's sister kinda ruined it. She's a hardcore vegan, so we'll call her \"Erin\" (IFKYK). Everything out of her mouth was something vegan related and everyone was pretty annoyed and mostly avoided her. If she wasn't going on about ethics, it was about health. She was basically shaming our older friends/relatives for not wanting to take care of their bodies. She told my father that his diabetes is from eating animal fat. At one point, she even left to go to the store and returned with a ridiculous amount of VEGAN frozen patties (and bread and other items) and demanded we cook them up and serve them as an option. So to be nice, we cooked one pack....no one touched them. She was absolutely tiresome. Other than Erin, the BBQ was a hit. So we did it again this summer. \n\nWhen it comes to Erin, my spouse and I disagree. I do not engage with her and she knows I'm not fond of her. He and his parents think she is harmless, whereas my family frikkin hates her guts. I did not know this until recently, but Erin got into it with one of my cousins \"Mary\" last year who tried to be friendly with Erin since Mary used to be vegan in the past but gave it up when it made her sick. Apparently Erin attacked Mary calling her \"ignorant\" and insisted she was \"doing it wrong\". \n\nSo I did not want Erin at this year's BBQ at all. But I did not want to cause any drama. I didn't even bring this up to my spouse. I knew that Erin was gonna go on vacation for a whole week this month, so as soon as she left, I set up the BBQ on the Saturday right before she's supposed to come back (Sunday). Everything went perfectly as planned. However, Erin saw the photos on Facebook and was PISSED. She found out from my spouse that I chose the date so she texted me that I am evil, heartless, and a bully for leaving her out. She also brought up other really personal things to attack me so I ended up blocking her. Erin has since ran to my spouse and her parents to complain constantly and won't let it go. \n\nSo what could I have done differently? Was I wrong to schedule the BBQ when she was out of town?\n\nEDIT 1: A little more context. Erin absolutely knows her behavior is annoying. My mother straight up told her what we were all thinking when she made that diabetes comment to my dad. Erin also does not handle criticism well. If I went and told her that she was not welcome to the BBQ this year, she would do the same thing that she is doing now and complain to her parents and my spouse and likely show up to the BBQ anyway. I believe planning the BBQ while she was away was the best thing to do. Because she can't prove that I did it on purpose. And as far as my spouse and my other in-laws know, it was just a coincidence and not my intention at all. So no one knows I did this.

I don't blame you at all for scheduling the BBQ when she was not able to attend due to how she behaved at the last one and the fallout caused amidst the rest of the attendees.\n\nAnswering questions about veganism if people ask? Fair. Asking for a pack of vegan patties to be cooked so then they have something to eat and it also offering people the opportunity to try them if curious? Also fair. Being obnoxious? Not something you should have to tolerate.", "NTA\n\nBut, I agree with some posters that you need to lay down the law with her. \n\nShe cannot ruin other's good time by preaching her religion, cannot try to shame them, is not allowed to give health advice or in any way insult them. \n\nYou will provide a vegan alternative, but she is not allowed to be pushy, demanding or shame others if they don't want to partake. \n\nIf she breaks the rules, she's no longer welcome at your home.

NTA for avoiding her tantrums this year.\n\nHowever, I don't think you can do this every year without them catching on that this is intentional, and I could foresee Erin pretending to be unavailable just to catch you out.\n\nI wonder what would happen if you hire someone to come and playact being a friend of yours who would then babysit Erin. Wherever she goes, her babysitter goes too. Every time she criticizes and bullies others, her keeper loudly exclaims something like \"Erin! I can't believe you would be so rude!\".

Your house your rules.", "NTA\n\nErin has been given the opportunity to grow up and realize what she says and how she acts can have negative consequences. While she was actually correct, it was also extremely self centered of her to think you scheduled the BBQ this weekend because you knew she would be gone instead of it just working out that way.\n\nHowever, this is not your BBQ.

At this point regroup your spouse and get them on your side by pointing out that if this person sucks enough to get you to take such drastic measures, then if you've never been super unreasonable before you need them to see what led to you taking such a drastic approach.

Why would she when his position is \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think/want\u2019 \n\nAnd if you\u2019re right then he cares even less than I was giving him credit for, means he didn\u2019t and still doesn\u2019t give a shit she wasn\u2019t able to come\n\n> Erin has since ran to my spouse and her parents to complain constantly and won't let it go. \n\nSo either hubby/parents don\u2019t care or they do know and are pissed too", "So you lack reading comprehension where she HAS had the conversation said it to him and he doesn\u2019t care, so there is no boundary\u2019s because he won\u2019t enforce them at all, Because as you just said his feelings were known as \u2018let her be an massive AH to guests I don\u2019t see anything wrong\u2019\n\nHE knew she was not able to attend and DID NOT CARE that she wasn\u2019t able to come, if he did HE could have said \u2018we have to do another day sis is unavailable\u2019\n\nMost ppl wouldn\u2019t let their sister be an AH to all the other guests. And you don\u2019t care what he\u2019s doing to OP and her family\u2019s relationship because of his actions?", "Grape minds think alike! \ud83d\ude02", "Weak argument against \"we want EVERYONE to live\" pointing out the animal-centric viewpoint of veganism that's also ok with animal deaths so long as it's in the interests of that sweet, sweet, bitter kale and in a way that mirrors the behavior of pro-animal organizations like PETA killing thousands of animals to \"save\" them from exploitation? Ok. You ~~bloodmouths~~ chlorophyllmouths are funny.", "I think the point was that veganism contributes to those same problems, so to criticize an omnivorous diet for the same is highly hypocritical.", "> Even before the edit she still doesn\u2019t hold the responsibility for 2 parties.\n\nThat I would agree with. She does not have a responsiblity, but it is an option. Especially if one of the goals is to \"not cause any drama\".", "She never had the conversation with him about this. Never\u2026\u2026she admits she hasn\u2019t right in the post. Her husband knows she doesn\u2019t like Erin but she has never had a conversation with her husband specifically about her issues.\n\nAnd like i said previously. She is STILL lying to him and his parents, making them think choosing the date was accidental, purposely trying to make Erin out to be crazy\u2026\u2026because in her words \u201cErin will never be able to prove I did it on purpose.\u201d", "I love the puns, Ive got bunches of them.", "Animals die, that's nature and also just food production on a mass scale. Sure, in an ideal world we'd be able to provide for everyone with no suffering but i don't think it makes a person a hypocrite to live in a non-ideal world and still try to minimize that suffering. And I know this this is purely anecdotal but I've never met a vegan who supports PETA and I've met a lot of vegans.", "> When it comes to Erin, my spouse and I disagree. I do not engage with her and she knows I'm not fond of her. He and his parents think she is harmless, whereas my family frikkin hates her guts.\n\nThey both know the others position because it HAS been discussed previously. And again HE DOES NOT CARE that she couldn\u2019t attend that\u2019s why HE hasn\u2019t said anything", "This quote you chose proves my point. Like I said, he knows she doesn\u2019t like Erin, OP never had a discussion with him about these issues.\n\nShe deviously made a plan regarding HIS sister behind his back\u2026..and is STILL lying to him about it to make Erin look like the bad guy, which is VERY LIKELY affecting his relationship with his sister. Something OP should have zero control over.  And something no spouse should ever want to interfere in, even if they don\u2019t like the sister.", "NO they HAVE discussed it just not this time because last time went nowhere.\n\nAnd NO she did not do anything behind his back he knew that sis wasn\u2019t available but DID NOT CARE, still doesn\u2019t as he hasn\u2019t said anything only AH sis has.\n\nIf he cared HE could have planned it or said do another day, but he DOES NOT CARE as much as you think. And if he does then he should have made the effort so any \u2018strain\u2019 on their relationship is HIS doing (or lack there of)\n\nIf he want a get together with sis HE can organise it not dump it on OP, who picked the date that best suited her, the organiser"]}
