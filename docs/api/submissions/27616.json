Let the girl's parents know you are willing to help financially, with rides to appointments, and babysitting when the child is born. 4.

Why doesn\u2019t your son want anything to do with her? Did she do something to make him distance himself? Does he not believe she\u2019s pregnant, or that the child would be his if she is?

I chose to withhold the specifics from her because she was overbearing and I knew that she would try to insert herself at every available opportunity.

Just get the test done.  If she has a baby get the test done and that's that.  You need to chill out and give her space.  It's fine offering support and all that but you're over stepping.\n\nIt's your sons (possible) baby.  Not yours.  You might have good intentions but wow.

It was very passive-aggressive and disrespectful.  \n\nObviously, this girl does not want a relationship with you unless your son is onboard/involved as well.  I understand that you are excited for a grandchild.  However, to this girl, your grown son needs to be involved as well.  She is not required to join you with her medical appointments or to even seek a paternity test.  I know you may think that you are protecting your son by seeking a paternity test.  However, she may feel that, if your son isn\u2019t interested in her pregnancy, then she\u2019s just not going to put his name on the birth certificate.  Or maybe she\u2019ll put his name on, but just to seek child support.  You can always seek a paternity test after the child is born.  However, this girl does not owe you anything.  So, you really need to stop harassing her.

It sounds to me like she does not want anything to do with you unless your son (the baby\u2019s father) is also involved.  She clearly chose not to include you in any of her appointments.

Please never refer to anyone as \"this young lady\" ever again", "YTA. Pregnancy and hospital visits are very intimate things. I don't know why you think she'd naturally take any of your son's relatives into her very private experience of carrying this baby. I also don't understand why you seem to be patronizing her by forcing yourself into her pregnancy. Focus on your son. Once the paternity test comes in, he's not magically going to become a better person. Prepare him for fatherhood now. Maybe throw in some respect for women limericks to spice up his lessons.

Maybe instead of worrying about whether this girl may or may not be pregnant and harassing her when it should be between her and your son, you should worry about why your son is impregnating random women and thinks it\u2019s acceptable to be a deadbeat.

It does seem potentially suspicious, but you need to stay out of it and instead spend that time talking to your son about why he thinks his behavior is okay.

It\u2019s a lose lose in that case. Hindsight is 20/20, but best practice would be to offer and give support, follow through with is when it\u2019s asked for, and keep your mouth shut otherwise. If your opinion isn\u2019t being sought, they\u2019re not secretly asking for it. Send a care package with vitamins, some belly butter, a framed photo of the sonogram pic and a note. If she is the mother of your new grand baby, that will go a long way towards recognizing her. If she is legit pregnant but it\u2019s not your son\u2019s, you\u2019re still recognizing her as a human. If she\u2019s not pregnant, that\u2019s a great dig. Either way, that should be the end of it for a little while.

I would also seriously make a bet the son was with her before she turned 18 as well.\n\nSlavery was legal, and child marriage still is legal to this day. Marrying a 10 year old is considered a legal defense against what would otherwise be statutory rape in too many states. Legal means shit-all to me. It's disgusting. Legal =/= right.", "Beside the way they SHOULD,  which is talking to the son about the realities of being a father. This really comes off a a guy who picked up a high schooler, honestly. He needs to wake up yesterday.", "Her son is 23.  Girl is 18.\n\nOP still needs to leave her alone.  Her son is an adult.  She can speak to him.", "Too many people don't realise things like antibiotics can affect it as well.", "Or the typical \u201cbut she is mature for her age\u201d\ud83d\ude44 creeps being creeps", "100%", "Hey, OP is \u201csure he\u2019ll be a great father.\u201d You know. Someday.", "LOL. This is exactly what I was thinking. It sounds like my completely crazy and overbearing ex-mother-in-law with zero boundaries. I feel so sorry for this girl. At least OP has enough insight to even question whether she's being the asshole or not.", "The guy who discovered fetal DNA in maternal blood allowing for non-invasive prenatal testing got a Lasker prize for it lmao", "Actual scientist and doctors say you are wrong. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3910294/#:~:text=The%20test%20accurately%20identified%20paternity,0.05%25)%20were%20called%20indeterminate.\n\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-39367-0", "When he \"warms up to it.\"\n\nMy eyes rolled so hard.

He'll no doubt tell the new partner that 18F kept him from the baby for no reason, instead of just admitting that he's a dropkick dad.", "Okay?  I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t?  I\u2019m taking issue with the lab tests that these other people developed, apparently based on his discovery, which don\u2019t have FDA approval or the scientific backing for their claims of accuracy.  His discovery and the testing and its accuracy are not the same thing.  Unless you are saying he also made the tests?  Are you?", "For the first study (which involved only 21 tests): \u201cAll authors are employees of Natera and/or hold stock or have options to hold stock in the company.\u201d  Enough said.\n\nAs for the second\u2026it was also quite a small sample, but their false negative rate was 6%, which is more than 1 in 20.  Not the 99.99% advertised on every website I saw and high enough to be concerned about.  And the other tests referenced in it are even worse.\n\nAnd none of these tests are FDA approved.  As low a bar as that actually is, they don\u2019t clear it and the FDA has been warning people about the claims being made by these companies of late.  Because they don\u2019t actually have the science to back them up."]}
