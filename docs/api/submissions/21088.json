During a school trip to England, Steve's behavior became increasingly strange and bothersome towards my friend. He continuously followed and approached our friend group despite our attempts to avoid him. Steve even waited outside the women's bathroom when my friend went inside, causing her distress. Eventually, we found a spot away from Steve, but he later found us and persisted in trying to join our group, disregarding our rejection.\r  \n\r  \nHe resorted to manipulative texts and guilt-tripping our friend if she didn't talk to him. Feeling concerned for everyone's safety, and seeing my friend on the brink of a breakdown, I confronted Steve and said: \u201cLeave us the fuck alone, you\u2019re acting like a creepy stalker.\u201d After my words, he dramatically stumbled backwards and pretended my words hurt him so much he couldn't walk anymore. This resulted in him sitting with us for a few minutes, while we ignored him. Eventually he left and stayed away for most of the trip.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, when we were almost home, he persisted waiting for our friend outside the bathroom in a gas station. He was manipulating her to talk to him again. Fearing for his and our friend's well-being, we involved a teacher.\r  \n\rThe teacher intervened and put an end to Steve's harassment.\r  \n\r  \nWe thought it was over, but rumours quickly started to spread at our school, especially about me and Steve.\r  \n\r  \nBack at school, we were called for a conversation with our principal.\r  \nSteve had already had multiple comversations with him, so we thought this wouldn't cause more problems. But it quickly became apparent that Steve had twisted the truth and portrayed himself as the victim in these previous talks.\r  \nOur principal scolded our whole group for bullying him.\r  \nHe insisted on my friend and Steve talking again, to \"work things out\".\r  \nMy friend burst into tears at the mere thought of having to talk to him again, but our principal didn't budge.\r  \nThe principal accused me of verbally abusing Steve, and I was required to write a personal apology letter. When we tried to tell him our side of the story, we told him we had set a clear boundary that didn't respect. Our principal told us that people in our lives will be crossing our boundaries and we'll just have to get used to it. So according to him, us protecting our boundaries was not the right thig to do here.\r  \n\r  \nOur attempts to tell our side of the story fell on deaf ears, and the school only believes Steve's story.\r  \nAs a result, I'm being portrayed as the villain and am starting to believe this. \r  \n\r  \nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1688237021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o2em9/aita_for_bullying_a_boy_in_my_class/", "score": 239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They do no verification of facts.

What I *can* say with certainty is that you are under NO OBLIGATION to include Steve in your friend group. You have no obligation to work things out.It would be different if you were gossiping and trying to get *everyone* to shun Steve, but that doesn't sound like what happened at all. Steve can be butthurt all he wants. Rejection happens sometimes. You don't owe him anything. You dontl belong to Steve, you don't belong to the principal either. Your principal sounds abusive trying to force you to be friends with someone you don't like. Personally, I wouldn't have written the apology letter, but then I'm the sort who'd stick to my guns even if I got expelled.\n\nIf I were you and I felt any uncertainty, maybe I would talk to Steve myself and  NOT APOLOGIZE, but explain to him WHAT he did that was creepy so that he understood EXACTLY what the problem was. You weren't wrong to tell him off and clearly the level of harshness you used not only was needed, but anything less wouldn't have worked. He STILL feels entitled to interact with you! IT STILL DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO HIM even though you went that hard and that direct!  Could you have been more clear about the specific issues? Maybe, but if he didn't understand he was overstepping his welcome that is also on him for not reading the room and knowing etiquette about how and when to approach OR NOT approach girls.\n\nSteve needs a reality check and your principal needs a boot to the ass right out of the school.  \n\n\nEdit: typo", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In fact she was so frightened by your refusal to leave her a lone to which your behaviour started stalking her wherever she went.  Toilets are no longer safe to go to a lone because right now you stand directly outside waiting to corner her.  She is so frightened by your unreasonable behaviour that we as her friends don\u2019t leave her a lone anywhere in the school, as the principal refuses to address your ugly behaviour and thought by ordering us to apologise to you it would be over.\n\nWe know by the statistics men who start to stalk females because they can\u2019t accept when a no, is a no go off to grow in their abuse.  They cannot see how destructive their behaviour is to the person they are focused on, not even court involvement slows them down much.  This is why females get seriously hurt or killed by delusional men who then in turn believe it\u2019s better they were dead so no one can have that female.  \n\nAfter I hand this letter over to you, xx , I and the rest of our friends will go to our parents to raise this serious issue further.  But don\u2019t think that will be the end of it, as our next stop will be the police station - so we can make a complaint about your stalking and the principal\u2019s refusal to address the issue.

Completely different situation (involving censorship), and several decades earlier, I got into an issue with a Dean, and Principal, I happened to freelance at the local paper and a reporter/mentor wrote a story about it.

He is further creating a hostile and unsafe environment for your friend and the rest of you. You need your parents' support and to take it over the principal's head, to the superintendent and school district. I would actually write email explaining the situation and cc it to my mayor, governor, and state and federal representatives, as well as copy them on all communication you have with your principal. Put everything in writing. Make it really hard for him to hide what he's doing. Good luck.", "NTA, and your principal is so wrong on this.  Involve your parents...have them meet with the schl counselor and the principal.  If that does not work, go to your principal's superior at central office.  You set reasonable boundaries and Steve walked right through them.  His behavior could escalate into dangerous territory.", "NTA. \n\nGood on you OP. Thank you for standing up to him.\n\nThis is outrageous. Inform teachers and people about this and what the principal has done. His rumouring is unjustified, unlike your actions to protect yourself and your friends, which is brave and courageous.\n\nIf this behaviour persists, take action and make sure many people understand the correct story before people twist the story."]}
