Today I had overslept and decided to stay home from school. Earlier around 7:30 My mom came into my room yelling at me to get up and go to school. I had just woke up at the time and was still half asleep, I told her I didn\u2019t want to go to school and went back to sleep she proceeded to yell at me until she decided to leave because i was ignoring her, She had did this 3 times without knocking (the third time she came in I was fully awake). Since I was already awake I decided to get up and lock my door to get ready for the day, as i was getting dressed my mom suddenly started pulling aggressively at my doorknob and banging on the door, yelling at me and asking why the door is locked. I ignored her and continued to get ready, she finally left yelling and told my grandma that me having a lock on my door was dangerous and needed to remove it, my grandma agreed and starting yelling at me that I \u201chave no right to lock doors in her house\u201d I yelled back at her and said that I was naked. My mom got mad at me and said that I \u201ccould of just said that\u201d even thought she trying to barge in. P.S They do this all the time and have caught me naked multiple times in my room. So..

Do you go somewhere flexible where you an swith to online learning for the day or were you just skipping?", "ESH. Why are you randomly skipping school? They should not remove your lock because you do need privacy but you mostly suck because you caused this whole mess in the first place.", "esh you all sound dysfuncitonal", "YTA, you didn't like the several exchanges in getting up and ready for the day.  If when you finally got up and were getting ready, you would have indicated to your Mother that you were naked or getting dressed.  I doubt very much this was the case at that moment.  You were frustrated and angry and used the locking of the door to not have to deal with your mother face to face.  Your 14, still a minor, you don't like how your mother didn't cater to your wishes and threw a tantrum.  Mom could have handled it better, but you could have too.  Simple power struggle.  If they remove the lock, you only have yourself to thank for that.", "ESH\n\nFirst of all, you are 14 and need to go to school. Oversleeping is no excuse, your mom should insist for you to attend school. \n\nHowever, you deserve privacy and you are allowed to set boundaries. Your mom shouldn\u2019t come in your room without knocking if she is not worried about your safety. You should not feel the need to have a lock on your door. \nPrivacy is respect and she should respect the fact that, at 14 you do not want her to come in your room unannounced. \n\nGo to school, take out the lock and set boundaries with your family.", "You're 14. It's not that you're intentionally being an AH, but you absolutely are.  You know why she's done this three times?  Because you're being an AH, not going to school which is your primary responsibility as a 14 year old and her LEGAL responsibility. She's probably at the end of your rope, since you are at the age where you should have already developed some responsibility for yourself and your schedule, and yet she still has to treat you like you're 8.  If you don't want her to invade your privacy, take care of your business and don't make things harder on her.  You can do better - currently you are choosing not to.", "YTA\n But not for locking your door.\nThink of it from your mom's perspective. Her daughter refuses to get up to go to school, an important thing that, as a parent, it's her job to make sure she does.\nThree times you try and she goes back to sleep claiming she doesnt want to. Next time you try, its locked. When you ask why, no answer.\nAll signs point to your daughter locking the door so she can keep sleeping without being bothered.\n\nThis not only keeps you from doing your job as a parent since you dont have access to the situation anymore, but is also very concerning since your daughter seems to think not wanting to do an important thing is a good reason not to do it.\n\nLater you find out that she WAS awake and just didnt care or reapect you enough to even answer your question. A one second effort which would have IMMEDIATELY solved the situation, but she thinks so little of you, you werent even worth blurting out \"im getting dressed\".\n\nI think you owe your mother an apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Neither is not wanting to go. You're old enough to get yourself ready on time and attend school properly. \n\nBut your mother could have handled your behavior better by taking away privileges or adding extra chores rather than yelling or making a scene.", "YTA You could have just said you were getting dressed. Instead she had every reason to believe you were refusing to get out of bed and go to school, which is literally your only job. And her job is to make sure you do it. You can provoke your mom all you want but you're going to be TA for it.", "ESH you said you overslept but your mom came in at 7:30 last i remember school doesn\u2019t start till 8 so it\u2019s not like you would be very late, you also stated she has done this 3 other times, you\u2019re 14 years old you should not be skipping school just because you feel you slept in 7:30 is not sleeping in and if you hadn\u2019t had ignored your mother and acted they way you did your mom probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten angry, your mom and grandma are also AHs because they do need to respect your privacy, however if taking your lock off your door will help them get you to school then they can take the lock.\nGO TO SCHOOL", "YTA. You are 14.", "ESH. for obvious reasons i feel really don\u2019t need to be explained but - your mother needs to learn how to communicate. you need to learn how to communicate. i understand shutting down when you\u2019re being yelled at but had you said you were naked and that\u2019s why the door was locked\u2026 it likely would\u2019ve changed this whole situation. speak up.", "ESH, at least you didn't get  beaten and dragged to school, I'm sure lots of kids have for being lazy and not wanting to go to school", "I didn\u2019t go to school because I overslept and lately have been sick", "True I do agree I should of handled it better", "We are", "I agree but I also think I should be able to have a lock to have atleast a little privacy", "I agree but with my family they act as they don\u2019t know boundaries and do this multiple times a day", "I agree but I still think my mom has some wrong on her side as she has been doing this for a long time way before I even was 8. thank you though", "I agree and will apologize later today as she is at work thank you", "This.", "I agree but this has happened multiple times so i feel that she should give me the least bit of time to get ready", "I agree that I shouldn\u2019t of ignored my mom also my school starts early 7:30 is the time it starts so I have to get there around 7:15 or 7:20", "Why does my age make me TA?

How was she to know you were getting up and getting dressed?", "You should be doing what your mother says. You don't get to decide when you go to school. You don't get to decide to lock your mother out of your room and refuse to open the door when told to.", "Your mother is legally responsible to make sure you're in school", "True, thank you I will tell her next time", "True but am I not allowed to have privacy? They purposely walk into even when I have told them I\u2019m changing. Please do remember this has happened before multiple times", "yes, i know", "Then just say, I'm naked, if you are, and once you're decent, open the door. Once you've established a pattern of respect on your part, ask for your family to knock on the door before barging in. But they have to trust you first, and all I read was a post from a brat, being annoyed her mother was unhappy you skipped school, ignored her several times, closed the door with a lock, didn't respond to her (all the while with a lovely attitude, if the tone is right).", "I agree and I have a \u201clovely attitude\u201d because I am being respectful to the commenters. Also you obviously didn\u2019t read the part where it said that this has happened multiple times, before this even happened I have told them times and time again that I am either naked or changing and they still come into my room and that is only when they knock and when they don\u2019t they get a full on look of me naked and then proceed to ask me why they didn\u2019t tell me I was naked. thank you for your comment though", "I did. Your family butting in is no excuse for you having a poor attitude, skipping school, sulking. Speak to them, be more respectful (seriously, skipping school because?..), answer your mother, ask them to not yell (and don't go out of your way to provoke them into it by not answering, etc) and expressly say how uncomfortable you are, as a fourteen year old, to have their privacy invaded and for your body to be on display. But don't be a brat (I overslept, I don't want to go to school, I'm not saying anything to the mom, closing the door and then get pissy when said mom wants to know what's happening, all the while she probably has to get ready to go out into work herself)."]}
