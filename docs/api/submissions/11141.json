A park caretaker would ask the dog to be removed. \n\nIf there's only one type of facility (In this case a volleyball court), the person not using it for the intended purpose is being selfish and inconsiderate where they can do what they need to do elsewhere.

He can fuck off with dog.", "NTA and I say this having had two large dogs over the years with hip problems (thankfully not of all of them have had that).  I looked up to verify what I knew from my experiences--soft sand (which is the type of sand at a sand volleyball court) is NOT better for dogs with hip problems.  \"Harder/Firmer\" sand (like at the beach, closer to the water line) and grass are the best surfaces.  Unfortunately there are a lot of websites out there saying grass and sand are the best, but not specifying the type of sand.  Soft sand may provide a softer landing, however it also has added resistance and the surface is uneven and unstable (shifting) that isn't good.\n\nWe would actually drive the extra distance to one of the few beaches in our state that allow you to drive onto it because our second dog with hip problems LOVED the beach (and the water).  We were able to drive down to where she didn't have to walk over the softer sand so she could still enjoy something she loved as long as she could.\n\nAlso, when dogs get excited they can seem to be doing better but it's temporary.  Our first dog with hip problems didn't have any of the prior symptoms at the Vet appointment because she was amped up for the car ride.  Vet said this was common.  So I can understand why the guy playing with his dog might be thinking the soft sand is helping because the dog is just excited to be playing.  \n\nRegardless of the dog situation I still think you are NTA because the intended use of the place is for volleyball (hence the net).  As a parent (to now adults) I wouldn't have allowed my kids to take their sand buckets to the sand volleyball court to play in the sand either.  Same for hard courts like basketball--fine if the littles want to ride their trikes around but you need to move off the court if someone comes to play ball.  The riding can happen other places, basketball needs the hoops.", "NTA there\u2019s a net, for volleyball.\nIt\u2019s not a dog park.", "NTA- Yes the park is a public place but that is for people, dogs are not allowed everywhere. In the parks in my city there are signs specifically stating that dogs aren\u2019t allowed on the playground equipment, skate rink, baseball field, or volleyball court.

In the public realm, there are times when the intended use is flexible, especially if there is not a sign that says \"for this use only\".

A basketball court, for example, can be used for many different activities aside from basketball, and that's often a strategic design decision.

I don't agree with them, but it's also unavoidable cause you can't just train a cat to piss and shit on the grass. It's okay to be concerned about that though if they want to.\n\nThe point of it is the fact the dude isn't even playing volleyball and he is blocking the net. Pee and poop are just another argument.", "Biggest offenders are probably cats in any sand situation!", "That dog, dogs you haven\u2019t seen, cats, lots of cats, birds, rabbits, rats, squirrels, etc etc.", "No, there is zero difference between anything outdoors. You can't expect that that sandbox is even remotely not a toilet for tons of animals. I have one in my garden for the dog. She is just digging in it,  only pees under the shrubs in the corner of the garden. Still even though she never peed in it I am 100% certain it contains pee and shit.", "You do you piss boy", "NTA", "NTA there are places for animals and there are places for humans. If the dog to could spike the ball then that might be a different answer.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAs an avid volleyball player and an owner of multiple dogs who I absolutely adore, people should keep their pets out of recreational areas if they are being used. Using a court etc for its intention trumps random dude and his dog", "I mean, he coulda brought his dog to a dog friendly beach if his condition was really that serious. The place wasn\u2019t put there for dogs. It was put there for volleyball. simple.", "Yeah I\u2019m with you. Why bring you the pee and pop it\u2019s outside, outdoors are for outdoors things.", "Do you happen to live in glen burnie Maryland lol", "I promise you that if a court is outdoors and open to the public it's seen much worse than dogs. Saying this as someone who isn't a huge dog fan.", "> so I just don\u2019t understand the tennis court thing with so many dog parks\n\nTheir first comment *literally* said they used fenced-in courts because their dog is reactive. You\u2019re really suggesting they\u2019d be better off putting a *reactive* dog in a dog park? Never mind that a number of experienced dog owners & vets/techs recommend against dog parks anyway\u2026\n\nThat said, I am in Texas too, and I would side-eye a dog in a public court for at least half of the year, as asphalt and concrete can get too hot for prolonged paw exposure. Otherwise, seeing it in the mornings/evenings during the hot months, or during the cooler half of the year? I\u2019ve not experienced and don\u2019t have any issues in the public courts I\u2019ve seen dogs at then. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA you are pissed a member of the public is using public property", "Nta", "Agreed - the question is not who is technically correct, but is the OP an AH for being mean to/insisting on enforcing the rules (however you want to see it) to the guy with the dog."]}
