He can fuck off with dog.", "NTA and I say this having had two large dogs over the years with hip problems (thankfully not of all of them have had that).  I looked up to verify what I knew from my experiences--soft sand (which is the type of sand at a sand volleyball court) is NOT better for dogs with hip problems.  \"Harder/Firmer\" sand (like at the beach, closer to the water line) and grass are the best surfaces.  Unfortunately there are a lot of websites out there saying grass and sand are the best, but not specifying the type of sand.  Soft sand may provide a softer landing, however it also has added resistance and the surface is uneven and unstable (shifting) that isn't good.\n\nWe would actually drive the extra distance to one of the few beaches in our state that allow you to drive onto it because our second dog with hip problems LOVED the beach (and the water).  We were able to drive down to where she didn't have to walk over the softer sand so she could still enjoy something she loved as long as she could.\n\nAlso, when dogs get excited they can seem to be doing better but it's temporary.  Our first dog with hip problems didn't have any of the prior symptoms at the Vet appointment because she was amped up for the car ride.  Vet said this was common.  So I can understand why the guy playing with his dog might be thinking the soft sand is helping because the dog is just excited to be playing.  \n\nRegardless of the dog situation I still think you are NTA because the intended use of the place is for volleyball (hence the net).  As a parent (to now adults) I wouldn't have allowed my kids to take their sand buckets to the sand volleyball court to play in the sand either.  Same for hard courts like basketball--fine if the littles want to ride their trikes around but you need to move off the court if someone comes to play ball.  The riding can happen other places, basketball needs the hoops.", "NTA there\u2019s a net, for volleyball.\nIt\u2019s not a dog park.", "NTA- Yes the park is a public place but that is for people, dogs are not allowed everywhere.

In the public realm, there are times when the intended use is flexible, especially if there is not a sign that says \"for this use only\".

A basketball court, for example, can be used for many different activities aside from basketball, and that's often a strategic design decision.  Just because someone shows up to play basketball does not mean that they have authority over the court if someone is there using it for another (non harmful) purpose.
