A park caretaker would ask the dog to be removed. \n\nIf there's only one type of facility (In this case a volleyball court), the person not using it for the intended purpose is being selfish and inconsiderate where they can do what they need to do elsewhere.

He can fuck off with dog.", "NTA and I say this having had two large dogs over the years with hip problems (thankfully not of all of them have had that).  I looked up to verify what I knew from my experiences--soft sand (which is the type of sand at a sand volleyball court) is NOT better for dogs with hip problems.  \"Harder/Firmer\" sand (like at the beach, closer to the water line) and grass are the best surfaces.  Unfortunately there are a lot of websites out there saying grass and sand are the best, but not specifying the type of sand.  Soft sand may provide a softer landing, however it also has added resistance and the surface is uneven and unstable (shifting) that isn't good.\n\nWe would actually drive the extra distance to one of the few beaches in our state that allow you to drive onto it because our second dog with hip problems LOVED the beach (and the water).  We were able to drive down to where she didn't have to walk over the softer sand so she could still enjoy something she loved as long as she could.\n\nAlso, when dogs get excited they can seem to be doing better but it's temporary.  Our first dog with hip problems didn't have any of the prior symptoms at the Vet appointment because she was amped up for the car ride.  Vet said this was common.  So I can understand why the guy playing with his dog might be thinking the soft sand is helping because the dog is just excited to be playing.  \n\nRegardless of the dog situation I still think you are NTA because the intended use of the place is for volleyball (hence the net).  As a parent (to now adults) I wouldn't have allowed my kids to take their sand buckets to the sand volleyball court to play in the sand either.  Same for hard courts like basketball--fine if the littles want to ride their trikes around but you need to move off the court if someone comes to play ball.  The riding can happen other places, basketball needs the hoops.", "NTA there\u2019s a net, for volleyball.\nIt\u2019s not a dog park.", "NTA- Yes the park is a public place but that is for people, dogs are not allowed everywhere.

I wasn't aware of leash laws in other states.\n\nI still feel that the primary purpose of a volleyball court would be to play volleyball. The guy can train his dog inside the court if it is empty. But when people want to use the court for its original purpose, he should leave.", "What are the rules regarding this in your area? The city I live in has an ordinance stating no dogs/domestic animals on athletic courts and play surfaces (not that anyone pays attention to it). But if your area has something like this, it would help back you up. N T A for asking him to move off the court, but you could have done it in a better way.", "It isn't a safe assumption. Most dogs do their business towards the beginning and then play after. I guess all the strays and wild animals in the park use the specified places for bathroom. That's pretty considerate of them.", "No, that's not a safe assumption.", "> s. I'm just like this court is for sand volleyball, not for dogs to play, poop and pee in.\n\nLOL, I read that really fast and missed that part.  Does OP not understand that cats exist and wander in public parks? Updating my ruling.", "But is it used as a \u201cbeach\u201d by the community\u2026 Do kids play in it and build sandcastles etc. \n>\nThe reason I ask is because there are tennis courts in my neighborhood that clearly state no dogs allowed. However, the neighborhood is OK with dogs running around and playing in there as long as the owner and the dogs leave as soon as someone wants to play tennis. \n>", "There isn't anything that I am trying to \"make work\".", "So, no then. \n\nIt's a public park, and unless there's signage that indicates otherwise, the guy has every right to be there. YTA.", "Way to dodge the question. If the park is open to animals and the court has no specific restrictions, then the dog and owner have as much right to it as you do. YTA", "Then you are NTA, and I'll edit my top level accordingly. \n\nYou still lack empathy for the dog, but that doesn't make you responsible for the situation.", "Add this to your story please.  You were TA until you mentioned they were breaking the rules. Public parks =  gotta share with everyone.  Breaking leash laws = dog owner is major AH. Final judgement,  NTA.", "The purpose of leash laws is to have control over your dog. You saw the dog. How was it moving? Was it under the owner's control at all times?", "Fully agree. \n\nWhich is why I said:\n\n> Of course, if it is not a dedicated volleyball court, then he does not suck, and you do instead. He would also suck if his dog peed / pooped in the area designated for volleyball.\n\nPublic places are generally designated for multi-purpose. If the volleyball court was part of a beach, and the guy was playing with his dog in it before someone came by wanting to play volleyball, he was there first, using it as a general beach area, and wanted to finish playing with / doing physical therapy with his dog. It wouldn't kill OP to wait a little, considering the dog's hip issues.", "Yeah in a place specifically for another purpose", "I missed the part where there is any kind of sign or rule indicating that's not allowed.\n\nOh, right, because that part doesn't exist.", "It would depend on the rules of that particular dog park and whether you are willing to risk the lives of your cats. \n\nI'm not sure *why* you would choose to do that, whereas the guy in question had a good reason for what he was doing, but assuming your reason was reasonable, I wouldn't have a problem with it.", "Who says?", "I would have given him 10 minutes, a lot of dogs wind down naturally within that period of time of very active exercise.  \n\nIf he didn't voluntarily clear off by then, and assuming he saw you and it was obvious you were waiting for the court, your move should have been *asking* how long he planned to be using the space. Going in with the pee/poop comment was unnecessary and not even accurate.\n\n-->ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. Both of you should be more considerate of others. He was there first, but yes the court is designed for volleyball. No need to interact rudely about it.", "Doesn\u2019t make a difference in practice. The dog is presumably allowed there even if he shouldn\u2019t have been unleashed. Not sure y ppl fixate on dogs using the outdoors as a bathroom either\u2026.where do they think the bugs and birds and squirrels and all of the other animals go to the bathroom? It\u2019s the our doors. Take it for what it is. Also I was a lifeguard so yeah\u2026not just animal waste ppl swim thru at public pools. Probably the same at parks.", "Holy fuck what is wrong with people", "He\u2019s legally allowed to play there. He just should\u2019ve been on a leash.", "Yeah and its a volleyball court not a dog run", "How big is the sand pit at the playground though? Big enough for a German shepherd to move around in?", "Yep. Dog owners would be up in arms if a family took their toddler into an unoccupied dog park to play kickball and insist that it\u2019s the best place for them to be because the ball can\u2019t roll off(and they were there, first!).", "Totally agree with you on that point, just wanted to point out that it might not be illegal to have his dog off leash", ">Does OP not understand that cats exist and wander in public parks?\n\nWell they might, but there is a difference between wandering as a cat does and being brought there as this dog was.\n\nI would not consider the dog the AH for peeing where the owner bought him, but a designated volleyball court is an AH place to bring a dog who might pee.", ">Do kids play in it and build sandcastles etc.\n\nI've only seen them do that at the nearby playground.", "\n>The reason I ask is because there are tennis courts in my neighborhood that clearly state no dogs allowed. However, the neighborhood is OK with dogs running around and playing in there as long as the owner and the dogs leave as soon as someone wants to play tennis.\n\n\nYou basically proved his whole point and destroyed yours in one sentence", "I mean basketball courts don\u2019t say \u201cbasketball only\u201d and anyone with half a brain would not set up a picnic in the middle on the court\u2026.

FFS, it\u2019s obviously a volleyball court just because it\u2019s a public park doesn\u2019t mean dog owners have the right to use every area they want. \n\nOur local tennis courts don\u2019t have signs up saying no dogs or tennis only but people who aren\u2019t playing tennis know to vacate the court if people carrying rackets come in.", "I am a huge dog person,  and absolutely disagree with you.  Leash laws exist because no one ever has full control over their dog.  I can't tell you how many times me and my leashed dog have been run up on by a \"controlled\" off leash dog. My dog is friendly,  which is lucky for them,  but she's in training for therapy work and is supposed to ignore other dogs unless she is on a play date. These unleashed dogs don't help.  She was also attacked once by a German Shepard who was supposedly a \"controlled\" off leash dog.  So no,  in places with leash laws,  put the damn leash on or go to a dog park. Jfc.", "Confusion could be with your vote at the start, your reasoning is all sound but your vote changes depending on what the situation is. INFO might be more applicable", "So the volleyball nets set up there does not indicate it's intended use? Got it, thanks.", "The sand and volleyball net?", "I love dogs have two of my own I take them everywhere it is appropriate. However, a sports area where people play and wind up in the sand is not a dog-friendly place. If the dog used it like a litter box as a dog will do it makes the area unhygienic for the humans to use for its intended purpose. Any of those humans could get pink eye or worse from sand getting near their eyes that the dog has peed or pooped on or even had it rubbed its butt into. I'm all for loving your pups and wish I lived somewhere they could go more places with me. I still wouldn't do this because it is rude to the humans who in this issue come first.", "Its a volleyball court, not a dog park. Legally, he can be on a leash and be there, but he should have no problem moving when people want to use it for its real purpose.", "That's not OP's responsibility. If the owners dog needs sand, it's up to the owner to find a place where their dog can be off leash on the sand without disturbing others.", "I dunno...cats gravitate to sand for the purpose of \"relieving\" itself.", "Did OP see the dog pee or poop in the sand? Or are they assuming dog = pee and poop? Most trained dogs don't defecate just anywhere. My dog won't poop in sand, she doesn't like the texture and has never been okayed to go in the sand. Grass and dirt unless it's an emergency (i.e. massive bouts of diarrhea)", "NTA. (I edited parent comment)", "Lol what point exactly?", "You\u2019ve given me some ideas for this Saturday\u2026 \ud83d\ude1d", "I completely understand your point, but intended use doesn't mean that's its only use.", "Lol, ok. But there's usually a law on the books that states that.", "Who says a space only has one intended use? The sand made it useful to rehab his dog. It's a public space.\n\nI hope you never run laps on a tennis court or use bleachers to run up stairs. Don't ever let your kid throw a frisbee on a softball field. Don't do chair squats onto a park bench. Because things can only have ONE use in the world apparently.", "Why? He pays the taxes to fund it too. Public parks are for the public to use for their \u201cintended purpose\u201d or not. He had a genuine reason for not playing on the grass and why should OP have no problem waiting since he didnt get there first.", "I understand that, and perhaps there is something to be said for the owner of said cats being a bit of an AH for letting it roam next to a park if it knew it was relieving itself in the sand. The cat would not be an AH. It would be a cat. Nor is this dog. Animals are incapable of that distinction.\n\nThat is very different from someone bringing an animal to a dedicated volleyball court to deliberately let them lose. Especially on the basis of sand being easier on the dogs legs. Binnie and Dawson identified that sand is more intensive than grass, so its quite the opposite.", "You said that if the people are playing with their dogs on the court, they leave when someone wants to play. Lol", "Correct, but intended use has priority over personal use. \nI can skate on the basketball court.

They have rights too and all you do in fighting them is make yourself the AH (and the real actual problem). Perhaps you would recognize that if you read back your crippled dog comment\u2026you would recognize that situation.", "The point is that guy should do that, and is an asshole for not doing so.", "Yeah most likely had the same tone, once I get to the snarky part my villain story starts. But as long as I don\u2019t get there I can see his point lol", "If I had a health issue that wasn't bad enough to keep me from going to one place that is mixed-use, then I'd go to another place that wasn't.\n\nNTA", "Okay than cast your judgement that way. Why are you explaining it to me?", "Because you seemed confused about it? Sorry for trying to help, lol"]}
