Naturally, I asked why she trusted her friend more than me and then she told me about how her sister's husband cheated with a friend. I was angry at how I was being compared to someone else based on a mere accusation and we ended up arguing. Then we were just about to sleep and she told to sleep on the couch because she didn't feel comfortable with me.
