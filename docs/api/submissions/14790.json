Everyone agreed since I work today.  When he got off work this morning I served him something quick to eat.  I have a hotel booked for this weekend for us.  I was tring on clothing and packing whe. He asked to heat up his left overs.  I said \"I told you yesterday I wasn't making anything today.\"  He responded with \"your going to make a problem over heating something up on my birthday month\" I responded with \" I am tired and explained yesterday you keep making problems with me over food\"  he turned it around and said \" no your making the problems over food.  You just don't want to serve me anything any more.  Cancel the reservation I'm not going anywhere.

I don't know where people come up with this stuff, my wife would be furious and we'd be in counseling if I talked to her like that", "\u201cAs July is my birthday month, I will require my significant other to be my personal slave during that time and acquiesce to my every request.\u201d Who in the world would think that sounds reasonable?", "Right?!  I JOKE about it. Like, 'you beat me in card on my birthday month?!'  But it's a friggen joke.", "Exactly like he\u2019s trying to use that as an excuse to be lazy NTA", "Looking at her posts he threw a hissy fit on his birthday last year too. Idk why she\u2019s still with him.", "No kidding!  NTA", "Birthday month is when I tell myself I'm totally allowed to buy that thing because it's my birthday, and then I buy the thing.\n\nI am also an adult entirely capable of reheating my own leftovers, so \"birthday month\" conversations are kept between me and my bank account. \n\nOP needs to get well gone from whatever this is.", ">\"birthday month\"\n\nI celebrate my birthday month, too (it's fun). However, I also heat up my own leftovers (because I am not a child!).", ">\"your going to make a problem over heating something up on my birthday month\"\n\nOne couldn't make a violin tiny enough to respond to this man.", "This is always what I wonder. How did you get this far with such an unpleasant partner?", "THAT\u2019s the red flag you see? Not that he expects her to make and SERVE him three meals a day? That he can\u2019t heat something up on his own?", "I was just going to ask if OP was sure they were talking about a husband and not a toddler.", "Hey, my 7yo has never claimed so much as a birthday week, let alone a birthday month!", "He's old enough to marry her; he's old enough to cook for himself.\n\nNTA", "This is the way", ">This whole \u201cthis month is all about me because I have a birthday\u201d crap is ridiculous\n\nhehe I celebrate my birthday month. I figure the world is trash, and I want to milk absolutely all the joy I can out of my little life, including celebrating the entire month of my birth. \n\nHowever, I heat up my own leftovers all month long!", "I'm glad I didn't have to scroll AT all to find a comment like this. OP, healthy, mature adults don't use that excuse, ever. It's cringe and I am embarrassed on his behalf. What other excuses does he have for the other months of the year?", "And when he has the weekend off and nothing to do he can go clean and work around the House", "People do what you let them get away with.", "Hooooly shit...he is way worse than I even imagined. She cooks, cleans, pays all the bills, meanwhile he keeps the money he makes from his part time job for himself and collects toys???\n\nI feel so bad for OP. Imagine dealing with this guy for 20 years. I was in a 10 year relationship that gradually turned into something similar; I thought I'd never be able to break free from the person. Finally got out and it was the best decision I ever made. Got to finally experience a REAL partnership with a loving person and it changed my life.\n\nI really hope OP can manage to do the same thing. I feel so bad for her.", "It\u2019s pretty clear she does everything, every day, every month anyway\u2026.", "Only now that you mention it I fully realise how pathetic the situation is. It really is not even about cooking dinner (after all, the dinner-cooking wife is a trope sit-coms from the 1950's didn't take seriously anymore) but about warming up leftovers!", "I know someone who also celebrates his birthday month, but it's mostly treating himself to museums and shows, and the like. Not expecting everyone to bend over backwards for him.", "Turning 40", "Oh for sure, it\u2019s just the whole \u201cbirthday month\u201d thing that made me ask, if he\u2019s 19 then maybe he could get a pass (for using that statement) but if he\u2019s 49 then not so much.", "Do you realize how ridiculous this is???", "STOP being his servant ffs!!!!!  Let him give all the faces.\n\nAnd call his bluff.  You deserve a break so go on your vacation by yourself if you have to!!!", "Does he even know how to cook?", "Nah, birthday month is not a thing.", "Birthday months are a thing to some people (me!). Not treating your spouse like a maid is a thing to some people, too (also me!). While OP is doing her spring cleaning, she should throw the husband out with the rest of the trash."]}
