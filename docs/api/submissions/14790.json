OP needs to stop asking whether shes TA and start asking why she's still in this marriage with a partner who obviously doesnt appreciate her and moreso is being manipulative. \n\nHigh school sweethearts, 20 years, great. But look at who he is today and if that's someone who is putting in the effort to better help his addictions and your relationship or not. The answer should be as clear as day.", "OP needs a new husband.", "THIS IS A SHOCKING TWIST THAT WE COULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED.", "In preschool when I turned 5 I wore my birthday crown for the entire week of my birthday. (Our preschool teacher would make us special construction paper crowns with stickers and such for our birthdays.) By the time I turned 6 I realized that was really extra and was embarrassed that I made it a whole week.", "Make it clear to them that he is not to be allowed access either.\n\nChange all your passwords and log out of any potentially shared devices too.", "Yep, literally every kid I\u2019ve ever known, including myself, preferred having separated parents than a toxic household. This myth that two parent households are \u2018better\u2019 is dangerous, so many people stay \u2018for the kids\u2019 when 9/10 times the kids will prefer to have a non toxic environment to live in.", "Thank you! It was most definitely not a linear path and if my best friend wasn\u2019t as stubborn as she was I might still be there, but I think that just makes me that much more grateful for the freedom. It\u2019s not easy to have a loved one in that type of relationship, but at the same time they won\u2019t leave until they realize the toxicity themselves. I just wish narcissistic ah like this would take a long walk off a short pier one after another -_-", "This! I\u2019m buying this thing to wear on my birthday because it\u2019s on sale now, my bestie can\u2019t see me the week of because she\u2019s got a work trip so I\u2019m seeing her the week before, I\u2019m visiting my sister 2 weeks after the day so that\u2019s when we will celebrate, etc. It\u2019s to not make people feel bad about being unable to rearrange their whole schedule for you while still celebrating you and you not being an ass because you\u2019re a whole adult. It\u2019s to feel celebrated a little longer. It\u2019s not for a grown ass man to throw a child ass tantrum.", "Honestly kinda sounds fun if you take out the entitlement. I kinda wanna try it. Or at least a week of it. Maybe save up and have 7 small gifts to myself, and eat 7 special meals rather then what I normally do. Or like an event calendar type thing but for my birth month (mine is towards the end).", "The birthday month thing just shows how self absorbed he is. I wasn't going to comment on the serve stuff because I don't know what their actual home life situation is. I.e. they may have other things he does that makes up for the things she does. Not sure how equal or unequal it is in their everyday, so reserving THAT opinion unless told. \n\nBut yeah, he definitely can heat his own food!", "My mother was very sick in the hospital one year for her birthday. She says since she missed it, she\u2019s a whole year younger now. Sounds legit to me", "This is the way", "Lol you joke, but I have definitely seen \"wedding year\" on the wedding shaming forums. Like furious if someone has a sweet 16 or gives birth during their \"wedding year\"", "wow", "I think I vaguely remember this one.  dear lord. what night mares some people live.", "Honestly, it\u2019s like don\u2019t threaten me with a good time", "When I turned 40, I got a spa day and a pandemic. One of those I would gladly give back, but otherwise that's all he needs. A DAY. Not a month.", "Seriously why are you with him? He\u2019s addicted to collecting toys to the point he\u2019s put you in debt and on top of that expects you to be his servant? Girl wake up and divorce his ass. You\u2019d be better off alone.", "I\u2019ve read your previous posts. You know this isn\u2019t a you problem. Just divorce him already. He sounds exhausting, what positives does he add to your life?\n\nYou only get one life. Why tie yourself to someone who treats you like a servant?", "Just went back and read them. Holy crap, OP. You are worth so much more than this trash bag has to offer.", "Too bad her spring cleaning didn't involve her husband", "I use the birthday month excuse but only in ways that don't impact others. Should I get some b&j? Well, it is my birthday month...", "Well now that it\u2019s mentioned, this is my birthday year", "my dad calls it Freddie-mas", "We do \u201cbirthday months\u201d but it isn\u2019t one person doing something for someone all month. It\u2019s just to give a wide latitude to busy or out of town friends and family to celebrate when it\u2019s convenient for them to visit.", "This. And not just normal levels of \"person living there for a few days without picking up after himself\" mess. He will deliberately trash the place. Track mud in, drop food and spill drinks everywhere, etc. It's a moderately common way abusive or controlling spouses \"get back at\" or \"punish\" the other person for daring to leave, even temporarily.", "Ohhh I have seen that too! Lmao!! Like how dare someone get married in the same year as them and steal their ThUnDeR!\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Servants get paid .", "OP, you had it right the first time, go back to the divorce idea.", "And the good news is that her husband may have just starved to death before she gets back because he apparently is incapable of procuring or reheating food for himself", "NTA I was looking for this, go by yourself to the hotel sounds like you need it more then your immature, man/boy of a husband. Birthday month what in the blazes..is he 2 and he can't work the microwave. Sounds like you either need to stand up for yourself and make some healthy boundaries or you need to flat out leave him. You both work, yet he expects you to do all the house work, laundry and cooking. People who love each other will help one another. And then him throwing a tantrum over whatever makes me feel so bad for you and disgusted for him. I used to be you and it took 11 years and my ex cheating on me for me to realize i deserve better and I'm not a maid. You deserve better and much much more, no one should talk to you like this especially your SO.", "This. After all that work, how glorious would it be for OP to go enjoy that hotel by herself, with no one to bring her down.\n\nI'm guessing she wouldn't do it but it'd make me so happy if she did just take some time out for herself, guilt free.", "OP should invite a friend too. If her husband isn't coming maybe the restaurant will allow someone else to take the seat.", "That was my thought! Why waste the money because her husband wants to pout and tantrum like a 3-year-old and act like his microwave-button-pressing finger is broken? Go enjoy a relaxing luxury trip on your own, without anyone making any unreasonable, childish demands on you and your time!", "Came to say this!", "& invite her bestie to go with her", "I hope the OP does this", "This!", "Seconded. This comment should be higher.", "How could you say that on my birthday year? \ud83d\ude29\n\n*LIFE RUINED*", "And gas station sushi?", "my phone speaks primarily in expletives.", "My 14 yo collects them. A couple specific sets(My Hero Academia, and Stranger Things).

NTA, but yikes!", "Exactly!", "But wouldn't that ruin his birth and his death month?", "I hope she reads these comments and takes the trip. I mean the money is lost. No point in wasting it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is he gonna do? Stop talking to her? Treat her like his personal servant? Oh wait...he's already doing that. Might as well go and enjoy a trip.", "Jason does wear a hockey mask\u2026", "My husband and I both have names that start with J and both have our birthdays in October.
