The way I see it is your wife is taking a more subtle approach of telling you she's uncomfortable with your jogging partner. I partly think the whole neighbor scenario is completely made up because she doesn't want to take the heat for changing her mind about it. She may have been fine with it first and now she doesn't feel so comfortable about the scenario. To put it simply, your wife has asked you to stop and you disregard her because it's \"ridiculous\". Did you tell her you would continue to jog with the other woman? If your wife feels uncomfortable and is starting to think she has reason to distrust you, makes up a scenario to get you to stop said behavior and you disregard it will only feed into the negative cycle that has entered her mind. Talk to your wife again, ask her if she is actually comfortable with the jogging partner and she may tell you she isn't and you can have a conversation from there instead of completely disregarding your prior one.", "Agreed.  \"information presented\" is the key here.  He may not know what else lurks behind his wife's request to \"consider stopping\".  He better dig a bit deeper into this to be sure the wife has no misgivings of her own.  It is **conceivable**, that she is making this request based on her own misgivings but hiding behind the cover of the comment by a neighbor.", "And honestly even then the neighbors might not have had a problem with it, just given the OP a heads up in case she didn't know and it *was* out of the norm, which it's apparently not. Unless there were other things said or left out it all seems pretty harmless all around.", "It\u2019s so weird to think that the neighbours seem to think that when one conducts a clandestine affair, the way to do so is to be regularly seen in public with your affair partner all over the neighbourhood!", "This \ud83d\udc46", "While the neighbour looks at her pitifully.", "This", "Excellent question!", "Totally agree.", "Lol.

Telling your spouse to drop friends without a good reason (i.e. someone's life/health/finances are at risk) is controlling, red flag behavior.

If anything he makes himself look bad by presenting himself as a Cheater or something. The fact that you and the wife think you should avoid friendships/activities With the opposite gender because you fear peoples opinions even tho they shouldnt impact you at all is rather sad.

If the neighbor is fucking dumb enough to think that the husband is cheating because *checks notes* he is jogging with a younger person, they deserve all the ridicule thrown at them.", "That's quite a jump.  A marriage that depends on the opinions of people external to that marriage isn't that strong to begin with.", "He didn't say he was doing it in secret.

My initial argument is it is not based on some random stranger but it's the wife who has an issue with jogging partner. \n\nIf you are right, then yes, it is ridiculous and wife cares more about appearances than hubby. \n\nIf I am right, hubby needs to address this with wife before it really causes damage.", "It's not about the neighbour as an individual, it's about the husband being happy to have everybody thinking that and not caring about how it reflects on his wife or marriage. \n\nThen the wife is gossiped about as being a desperate limpet. What people think about you matters because that's how they talk about you and treat you. That's how your reputation is built. \n\nYou don't have to care about what other people think of you but not everybody has to be like you. Other people are entitled to their reputations and it's not unreasonable to expect your husband to present a respectable front.", "Well let\u2019s ask him for more clarity. O.P.
