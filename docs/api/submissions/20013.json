Anyways I was sitting with my friends the other day at school and while I was with them a boy (we'll call him Adam) came up to me with his friends and he asked if he could speak to me. I smiled and told him sure, so we walked away from our friends. I assumed he needed help with something but instead he asked me out on a date and he said he'd been meaning to ask me for a while now because he had a crush on me since he saw me around the school. I told him that while I'm sure he was a nice guy and that he was really sweet for asking, I told him I couldn't go on a date with him. He asked me why not and if there was something wrong with him and I told him that it wasn't him it was just that I was a lesbian and wasn't attracted to men like that or at all. As I said this his friends came out from around the corner and I didn't know they had been hiding there one of his friends called me an asshole for not being able to reject his friend in a nice way and insteas choosing to \"lie that I'm lesbian\". I told him that I'm sorry he feels like I was lying but I really am not, I just thought it was better to tell Adam the truth rather than to give him false hope.

NTA.\n\nThe friends were out of line, #1 for accusing you of lying, and #2 for eavesdropping on what was intended to be a private conversation. They are the AHs here, not you.\n\nLying to him and leading him on, THAT would have been a AH move, but you didn't do that - you presented your authentic self. That's the high road, and kudos to you for taking it!\n\nThe fact that you're able to maintain a friendship with Adam suggests that he's a better person than they are, or that he doesn't believe you and is still holding out hope. Hopefully the former. Best of luck - being a teenager is tough!", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation as to why you\u2019re not romantically interested in them. I can imagine with his age he probably feels insecure and wants to know how to fix his appearance so this doesn\u2019t happen again in the future, but that\u2019s also not your problem. If you said no, then the answer is no. \n\nHis friends also sound immature and probably think you saying you\u2019re not straight is a cop out excuse to not date someone which is absolutely absurd.", "NTA. The truth is generally a nice, good reason to deny someone a date. The interfering friend is totally TA. \n\nAnd no, you don't need to provide proof to Adam or his friend, ever.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong by being honest and respectful to him. You don\u2019t owe him a date or an explanation for your sexuality. His friends were rude and homophobic for accusing you of lying and trying to make you feel bad. You have nothing to apologize for. You handled the situation as well as you could. Don\u2019t let them get to you. You are valid and deserve respect.", "Nta, there's literally not an easier way to handle that situation", "You were honest and I\u2019m happy you felt you could safely say, \u201cI\u2019m a lesbian\u201d. Not sure what Adam\u2019s friends were expecting but this is their issue and not yours.", "Nah, NTA.", "NTA.  OP was polite and honest, perhaps even at or beyond the upper limit of what was required in the situation.  Friends are the AH for eavesdropping, and they make me suspect of the guy's motives here as well.  Was this genuine?  Was it a setup for manufactured outrage at OP being a lesbian?", "NTA - you told no lies, you did nothing wrong", "NTA his friends are especially for listening", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine.THey were the AHs. A rejection does not need a reason.", "NTA", "NTA. Ask someone a date dont give the other person the obligation to say yes. \nYou was nice with your first no. Then he push for more info, that was his mistake. A no is a no. And if you push you are gonna listen something you dont like. BUT even then you was nice and explain to him that wasnt for him, that was for you. And he and his friends dont believe you and they take that info wrong. \nThat is they problem, not yours.", "NTA\n\nAdam sure is though and so are his friends.\n\n* He took you away from your friends for a supposedly private chat when in reality it wasn't private - all of his friends were there listening in secret, this was manufactured situation for a reason and I suspect none of those reasons were good.\n\n* You said NO.  No is a complete sentence and doesn't need further clarification.  It was rude of Adam to ask why you said no.\n\n* Adams friends were AH's for what they said to you.  Further reason why you didn't need to tell Adam (them) why you said no.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not responsible for their immaturity and bitterness.\n\nAnd the one saying that you're lying \\*probably\\* lost a bet about your sexuality, which is ALSO very immature of them, but then, teenage boys.", "Don't mind me, I'm just waiting for the homophobic y t a comments.
