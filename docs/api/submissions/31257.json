But hers got down and I think is because of her age.\n\nOne day I received a message saying that she needs an urgent appointment with a doctor that she needs for a job she applied to and she was told she can borrow my medical insurance by giving her my ID because, in her words and capitals, I'M HER SISTER, and it's cheaper. I also received a call from my dad asking me to help my sister bc it was an emergency. I was busy and also felt pressed by both of them, so I gave her my ID.\n\nWhen I told my mom she got mad at me. She doesn't trust my sister at all. Turns out that if she has my ID (photo) she has access to my medical orders whenever she wants without asking me (the medical insurance only gives a limit order numbers per month, so if she uses them I would run out of orders). My mom told me to delete the photo and trusted her instinct.\n\nI didn't thought of it as a big deal. After all, she already got checked and I thought that was all. My bad.\n\nYesterday I received a bunch of messages and calls from my sister demanding I give her my ID again because she was at a different doctor. She also told me to hurry up because she could lost her appointment. She also said that she will also need it for her regular appointments with other 3 specialists too. So, she was already there getting checked and didn't ask my permission to use my insurance, also wanted to use it as she pleased. My mom told me to not answer any of her messages, instead, she told me to give her my sister's number and she will talk to her so I didn't get bothered. Some minutes after, I received a passive-agressive audio from my sister saying thank you and wishing me the best in life.\n\nToday, my mom told me that she explained to my sister that it was not okay to borrow my insurance like that because mine could get down for inappropriate use. That's true, it also says on the insurance's web page. My mom offered her to pay the price difference without the insurance discount for her, but asked her to not use my insurance. My sister got mad and said that nobody wants to steal my insurance and also called my mom an idiot ignorant for believing that. Then she hung up while my mom was talking.\n\nI'm furious. I never disrespected her mom in any ways and I was always friendly even in the moments when they would be mean. I want to say something to her, but my mom tells me not to avoid more problems.

I\u2019m also concerned that there is some other sketchy thing she may be doing. It makes zero sense to pretend to be you to the doctor if she needs some sort of health certificate for a job.

You may want to put a hold on your credit in case she\u2019s trying to open accounts in your name.", "NTA it\u2019s not legal for someone to use your insurance.

Why would you ever share that? When you age out of this and try to get medical/life insurance, everything she has tested for under your name, becomes a risk for you.

Children can be insured though their parents, but that ends when the children get their own jobs or at a certain age. At that point they are responsible for their own health insurance.

I don't know how far this reaches, but using OPs ID to get treatment, does that mean the doctors are opening OPs file instead of the sisters file? Meaning they're assuming the sister is OP? That means that if OP comes in later for something, sisters things will have been added to OPs files. This can be absolutely dangerous!

And makes no sense that it was for a job, yet she has more appointments??", "op is ignorant and nieve not sucky. tbh i do wonder how old they are it sounds like a situation where two basically trustworthy (in her eyes) adults were telling her to do something. so she did.i am really glad her mother had her back.", "Mom is the only one with any sense in this post!", "OP might still be a teenager and her father and 8 year older sister told her to do it.

If the exam was for a job, then the doctor's certificate of whatever would have the OP's name on it, not the sister's.  And if the sister suddenly needs to see another doctors under someone else's name...\n\nThen she's probably attempting to get prescriptions for opiates, or other controlled substances.
