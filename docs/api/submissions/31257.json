But hers got down and I think is because of her age.\n\nOne day I received a message saying that she needs an urgent appointment with a doctor that she needs for a job she applied to and she was told she can borrow my medical insurance by giving her my ID because, in her words and capitals, I'M HER SISTER, and it's cheaper. I also received a call from my dad asking me to help my sister bc it was an emergency. I was busy and also felt pressed by both of them, so I gave her my ID.\n\nWhen I told my mom she got mad at me. She doesn't trust my sister at all. Turns out that if she has my ID (photo) she has access to my medical orders whenever she wants without asking me (the medical insurance only gives a limit order numbers per month, so if she uses them I would run out of orders).

So, she was already there getting checked and didn't ask my permission to use my insurance, also wanted to use it as she pleased.

My sister got mad and said that nobody wants to steal my insurance and also called my mom an idiot ignorant for believing that. Then she hung up while my mom was talking.\n\nI'm furious.

Cause they don\u2019t actually need the new insurance card, they really only need the ID on the card and some personal info of the primary holder on the card.  I think the date of birth and SSN. \n\nI\u2019ve been on the receiving end of someone using my insurance and it can be scary to think about my medical records being affected by someone else\u2019s.  And it was just a pharmacy screw up.  The woman happened to have the same first/last name as me as well as the same date of birth but no insurance.  They ended up putting her on my account instead of making a new one.  But she ended up filling several prescriptions through my insurance before I caught the issue and then I had to fight with the pharmacy to fix it because they didn\u2019t want to admit they screwed up.  I also had to contact my insurance and let them know about the insurance fraud and which charges to flag as not mine so they could get reimbursed.  It was a lot of effort to fix the situation but I had to handle it because I have a lot of health issues and I couldn\u2019t afford to have my medications not be filled because of some strangers records halfway across the country. \n\nJust as a warning though, insurance WILL want to be reimbursed because they paid for those medical expenses based on the assumption that it was specifically for you.  Which means you\u2019ll probably have to provide your sister\u2019s information so they can go after her for reimbursement if you don\u2019t want them making YOU responsible for paying it back.  And more than likely, it\u2019s going to be a really expensive bill because it should have been billed as a private pay/out-of-network situation vs. an in-network.  And it will also include the cost of any labs which can get pretty expensive depending on what tests are being done. \n\nAlso, the fact that your sister lied to you about the situation, has coerced you into committing a crime, is trying to convince you to allow her to continue doing this indefinitely, and is only doing this because your insurance is \u201cbetter\u201d makes her an awful person.  Her behavior is not okay and she does not deserve any kindness or grace about the situation whatsoever.

I'm going to do that, that way maybe I don't get in more trouble, it's better if my insurance doesn't finds out by their own. And definitely I won't let her take advantage of me again. I was naive and didn't thought twice before giving her my ID so I know I'm in fault too, but now I'm aware of all the legal problems I might get into if I don't stood up for my self. Thank you!", "Your mom is smart, next time talk to her about this kind of things first.
