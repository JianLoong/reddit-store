We do \"get along\" but all I feel is a false interaction from her whenever we are together.\n\nMy dad has a \"familiar\" medical insurance than only both of me and her had access to because of relativeness. But hers got down and I think is because of her age.\n\nOne day I received a message saying that she needs an urgent appointment with a doctor that she needs for a job she applied to and she was told she can borrow my medical insurance by giving her my ID because, in her words and capitals, I'M HER SISTER, and it's cheaper. I also received a call from my dad asking me to help my sister bc it was an emergency. I was busy and also felt pressed by both of them, so I gave her my ID.\n\nWhen I told my mom she got mad at me. She doesn't trust my sister at all. Turns out that if she has my ID (photo) she has access to my medical orders whenever she wants without asking me (the medical insurance only gives a limit order numbers per month, so if she uses them I would run out of orders). My mom told me to delete the photo and trusted her instinct.\n\nI didn't thought of it as a big deal. After all, she already got checked and I thought that was all. My bad.\n\nYesterday I received a bunch of messages and calls from my sister demanding I give her my ID again because she was at a different doctor. She also told me to hurry up because she could lost her appointment. She also said that she will also need it for her regular appointments with other 3 specialists too. So, she was already there getting checked and didn't ask my permission to use my insurance, also wanted to use it as she pleased. My mom told me to not answer any of her messages, instead, she told me to give her my sister's number and she will talk to her so I didn't get bothered. Some minutes after, I received a passive-agressive audio from my sister saying thank you and wishing me the best in life.\n\nToday, my mom told me that she explained to my sister that it was not okay to borrow my insurance like that because mine could get down for inappropriate use. That's true, it also says on the insurance's web page. My mom offered her to pay the price difference without the insurance discount for her, but asked her to not use my insurance. My sister got mad and said that nobody wants to steal my insurance and also called my mom an idiot ignorant for believing that. Then she hung up while my mom was talking.\n\nI'm furious. I never disrespected her mom in any ways and I was always friendly even in the moments when they would be mean. I want to say something to her, but my mom tells me not to avoid more problems. BUT she will be having a word with my dad.\n\nAITA? My relatives say that she's right and I should just borrow my insurance.", "created_utc": 1700362341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yn9ec/aita_for_not_sharing_my_medical_insurance_with_my/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you ever share that? When you age out of this and try to get medical/life insurance, everything she has tested for under your name, becomes a risk for you. For example, if she tested positive for gonorrhea, that means you've tested positive for it. And it's fraud and can make you ineligible for benefits moving forward.
