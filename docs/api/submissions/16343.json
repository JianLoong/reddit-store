He had never actually adopted it, it was a stray that became his after he started feeding it. When his ex was living with him it got pregnant & had kittens, & they found homes for some, but others became strays.\n\nWhen I moved in I told him we should get the cat spayed & take it to a vet for the fleas. He agreed at first but weeks went buy & he still hadn't made an appointment. When I asked him if I should do it he said he was going to & I waited a few more weeks. All this time the fleas were getting worse and I was stressing that it would get pregnant bc he was only working pt & we were struggling financially. \n\nOne day after the flea bites kept me up all night I took it to the vet. I had to pay for a new patient exam plus the medication. When asked him to at least reimburse me for 1/2 the cost he became angry and frustrated. He said we couldn't afford to pay for a vet and prescription flea meds (I'd tried the stuff from the store and they didn't work). When I explained I needed him to chip in so I could continue to buy groceries and pay the bills he yelled at me that he had been waiting until we had more money, (though he had never brought it up before). I felt terrible for making such a dumb mistake, I know I should have checked with him first to make sure he could chip in, but the fleas were driving me crazy and the poor cat was scratching & chewing at itself all the time.\n\nAfter some time went by the fleas subsided. (I spent all my free time vacuuming and deep cleaning the furniture and carpets). During all this time I was the one always buying cat food and cleaning the litter. I would remind him and ask him to help which sometimes he would but he'd always go back to forgetting again. \n\nA few months later we finally had some money to spare, so I said to him we should have her spayed now. He became very angry & eventually shared that he doesn't believe in having animals sterilized bc it's their right to breed & have offspring & he also wanted to put the money towards a PS5. \n\nThis made me really angry, because it had already had a litter of kittens some of which they never found homes for. \n\nThe next time the cat was running out of food I reminded him for a week to buy more. I told him I was tired of it being my sole responsibility all the time, because it's his cat and also I was so scared it wld get pregnant again & I'd have a whole litter to take care of all by myself. I said I was going to take it to the shelter if he didn't buy it food & he said no and promised to buy food 3 days in a row. So when the cat ran out of food entirely, instead of buying more like I always do, I surrendered it to a shelter in the hopes it would be placed in a better home (it's a no kill shelter and they're very picky about who they adopt out to).\n\nMy bf is heartbroken & furious at me that I rehomed his cat w/o permission. We can't afford to adopt it back from the shelter & I'm feeling like I made a huge mistake.", "created_utc": 1683175547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137a8qz/aita_for_surrendering_my_boyfriends_cat_to_a/", "score": 3334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

EDIT: sorry, ex or bf?", "I say NTA, just because of lack of responsibility with the animal.\n\nIf you can\u2019t be responsible for an animal, even just a stray that stays around, you shouldn\u2019t have them. He would rather save money for a PS5 than invest some money in spaying a cat to prevent it from having more cats in the area and more mouths to feed which means more money spent, not smart. And you had good intentions, putting her in a no kill shelter with the hopes she goes to a home that will actually be responsible for her.", "Your boyfriend is TA. You did the right thing. Consider sending your boyfriend to a shelter too.", "NTA not taking cat to vet and not buying food is abuse by neglect, you saved that cat from miserable life. Now maybe do same for yourself and dump that neglectfull asshole? His communication was abmyssal through all of that. Imagine having a kid with someone like that.", "NTA Your BF seems like a child and if he can\u2019t take care of a cat he won\u2019t be able to take care of a human baby.", "I think NTA. If he could not be bothered to feed the cat, get necessary medical care for the cat, and wasn't in a position to care for it, then finding it a safe, warm place where it will be spayed and fed and adopted out is the least of all evils. I very much understand him being mad, I would be devastated even if I *had* been an inadequate pet owner due to my own negligence (because wanting to be responsible doesn't always make us so!), but you did the best thing *for the cat*. \n\nIf it was a matter of poverty alone, I'd have gone with E S H, but it's clear that he HAS some money, enough to save up for a spay and to pay for cat food... he was just choosing not to. There are pet food pantries and charities, so if it was just money, then you would have options. But he was making his priorities clear and the cat was suffering as a result.\n\nI do think that the relationship is probably shot, though, and I think that's what you sacrificed to help the cat. You did something that hurt him and probably made yourself the villain in his eyes, maybe forever. You were *right* but it's probably easier for him to think of you as a villain than for him to face the fact that the level of care he was providing was unacceptable.", "NTA, the mistake is not dumping this guy.

Her needs and health come first almost every time.  These creatures rely on us.  Your BF showed he can't be relied on.  You were doing the work.  So it seems like it was more your cat than his.\n\nYou brought the cat to a place where it can get into a better situation.\n\nAlso, it sounds like time to ditch the guy.  You deserve better.", "NTA - sounds like you made the right call OP. Your boyfriend wasn't taking any initiative to care for the cat himself and it sounds like you took all the steps necessary to have these conversations with him about it. \n\nIf anything, he isn't yet mature enough to own any animals if he can't afford to take them to the vet when they need it. I understand they can be expensive (we have pets) but it's a part of having a fur baby in your life.", "NTA. It\u2019s a stray cat, not an adopted one. If your bf isn\u2019t responsible enough for his cat, then he doesn\u2019t deserve to own the cat. \n\nEdit: Not telling him was kind of a dick move tho. I think you guys could\u2019ve talked over this a little bit more. But yeah, leaning towards NTA, but I think you should\u2019ve let him know or at least give him a warning/ultimatum. Welp just comfort him and make him forget abt his cat the best you can", "I expected this to be easy, but it isn't. It's marginal and I think that it is fair for your bf to think that you are TA at the moment, but I think NTA.\n\nIt is reasonable for you to draw a line under how much money (and time and energy) you're willing to spend on someone else's pet when they promise to look after it and then don't. Please understand that this is an accurate reflection of how your boyfriend is likely to treat other issues where your priorities are not aligned. This probably includes housework, household budgeting, and could later extend to childcare and eldercare. It's up to you whether he's worth all of that, but I know that I am not interested in dating people who promise me they will do a thing and then do not do the thing, repeatedly.", "NTA you did the best thing for the cat.\n\nHowever if this is how the man treats a cat, I wouldn\u2019t stay with him, not having it spayed and not giving it medication for fleas is highly concerning. Like what would he do for you if you were sick, or if you ended up having kids? He sounds too selfish to be with.", "NTA. If I suddenly stopped buying food for my cat or cleaning its litter, I'd be neglecting/abusing my cat. And I fully expect someone to take him away and make sure he's in a home where he's actually taken care of. At this point, that was a stray cat that he let inside.

You're TA because you are still with this dude. What are you thinking? He cares little about you which is evident in how he treated you after you did the human thing which was try to help an animal. He treats a living pet like garbage - can't be bothered to get it food, clean up after its waste, let kittens become strays, didn't care that flea bites can lead to an infection which could kill the cat.... didn't care that the cat was miserable and scratching all of the time. Didn't care that you, his girlfriend, was getting bitten all the time and spending hours deep cleaning and vacuuming. And he doesn't believe in getting a cat fixed? Are you serious?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease think about this relationship. What happens if you become pregnant? Do you think this dude is going to care at all to make sure that baby is healthy, fed and clean or would he make it your job while he plays that PS5 he used all the baby money for. If he can't even give a shit to do the bare minimum for his pet (that he was so upset to lose) do you think he'll do the right thing for a child?... or you?  You deserve better.

Overall, I think you gave your boyfriend fair warning and did what was best for the cat by giving it up. You were certainly right to advocate for the cat and try to get your boyfriend to be more responsible, get it spayed, take it to the vet, etc.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m concerned that surrendering an animal that doesn\u2019t belong to you to a shelter against the owner\u2019s will is some sort of theft.\n\nTo be clear, I think what you did isn\u2019t morally wrong and you\u2019re NTA.

I\u2019m gunna go ESH because you rehomed a cat that was not yours to rehome BUT I worked in adoptions at multiple animal shelters and that cat is at a no kill shelter will be better off. It will get spayed and provided for and find a good home, hopefully soon. And your ex did not deserve to have an animal, whether he got it as a stray or not. Some people should not have pets (or kids) and that\u2019s okay, but it really sucks when they do and those animals end up suffering for it, that cat will get medical attention at the shelter and get a second chance at life so at least your ex can feel good that in a roundabout way he sorta?

He seems to have no sense of responsibility for this creature's life. He literally holds the cat's well-being in his hands, yet did absolutely nothing to care for it.

You fed her, cleaned up after her, took her to the vet for what had to have been a severe case of fleas, and got her meds. While he twiddled he thumbs and saved up for a PlayStation? How is he so heart broken when he clearly didn't give a damn about this cat? Seriously how is a PlayStation more important than the cat you're supposed to love?\n\nYou saved her by surrendering her to a good shelter. Thank you for finding a no kill picky home shelter btw. They truly look for the best places for their inhabitants. They'll make sure she finally gets spayed and all the proper care she needs before going off to a great home.\n\nHonestly I'd drop the whole boyfriend too tbh.

It's hard to place kittens yourself, but he could've taken them to a no kill shelter or a cat rescue rather than let a bunch of kittens become strays/feral cats.\n\nThe second red flag was his lack of action on the fleas. Fleas can lead to tapeworms in both cats and humans (though it's rare in humans as you have to swallow a flea with the tapeworm larvae to get it - but *still*) on top of being difficult to get rid of and generally maddening. And he just... left you to deal with it? WTF?\n\n(If you ever run into this situation in the future - I really hope you don't - you can kill fleas with Dawn soap. It does involve the very dangerous act of bathing a cat, but if you can gear up, it's way less expensive than getting the flea treatments from the vet.)\n\nAnyway, he's a huge AH for leaving 100% of the cat care duties to you, constantly \"forgetting\" to buy it food/litter, and putting a gaming console over the cat's health.

And he is straight-up not feeding his cat appropriately. You entirely did the right thing. The cat may have been better in his house than it was on the street, but it wasn't being appropriately cared for, and the people in the shelter you gave it to will give it a better life.\n\nAlso please reconsider your relationship with a person who thinks that his desire for a PS5 is more important than the wellbeing of a living creature that he has adopted a responsibility for.
