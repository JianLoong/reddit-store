He had never actually adopted it, it was a stray that became his after he started feeding it. When his ex was living with him it got pregnant & had kittens, & they found homes for some, but others became strays.\n\nWhen I moved in I told him we should get the cat spayed & take it to a vet for the fleas. He agreed at first but weeks went buy & he still hadn't made an appointment. When I asked him if I should do it he said he was going to & I waited a few more weeks. All this time the fleas were getting worse and I was stressing that it would get pregnant bc he was only working pt & we were struggling financially. \n\nOne day after the flea bites kept me up all night I took it to the vet. I had to pay for a new patient exam plus the medication. When asked him to at least reimburse me for 1/2 the cost he became angry and frustrated. He said we couldn't afford to pay for a vet and prescription flea meds (I'd tried the stuff from the store and they didn't work). When I explained I needed him to chip in so I could continue to buy groceries and pay the bills he yelled at me that he had been waiting until we had more money, (though he had never brought it up before). I felt terrible for making such a dumb mistake, I know I should have checked with him first to make sure he could chip in, but the fleas were driving me crazy and the poor cat was scratching & chewing at itself all the time.\n\nAfter some time went by the fleas subsided. (I spent all my free time vacuuming and deep cleaning the furniture and carpets). During all this time I was the one always buying cat food and cleaning the litter. I would remind him and ask him to help which sometimes he would but he'd always go back to forgetting again. \n\nA few months later we finally had some money to spare, so I said to him we should have her spayed now. He became very angry & eventually shared that he doesn't believe in having animals sterilized bc it's their right to breed & have offspring & he also wanted to put the money towards a PS5. \n\nThis made me really angry, because it had already had a litter of kittens some of which they never found homes for. \n\nThe next time the cat was running out of food I reminded him for a week to buy more. I told him I was tired of it being my sole responsibility all the time, because it's his cat and also I was so scared it wld get pregnant again & I'd have a whole litter to take care of all by myself. I said I was going to take it to the shelter if he didn't buy it food & he said no and promised to buy food 3 days in a row. So when the cat ran out of food entirely, instead of buying more like I always do, I surrendered it to a shelter in the hopes it would be placed in a better home (it's a no kill shelter and they're very picky about who they adopt out to).\n\nMy bf is heartbroken & furious at me that I rehomed his cat w/o permission. We can't afford to adopt it back from the shelter & I'm feeling like I made a huge mistake.", "created_utc": 1683175547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137a8qz/aita_for_surrendering_my_boyfriends_cat_to_a/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

EDIT: sorry, ex or bf?", "I say NTA, just because of lack of responsibility with the animal.\n\nIf you can\u2019t be responsible for an animal, even just a stray that stays around, you shouldn\u2019t have them. He would rather save money for a PS5 than invest some money in spaying a cat to prevent it from having more cats in the area and more mouths to feed which means more money spent, not smart. And you had good intentions, putting her in a no kill shelter with the hopes she goes to a home that will actually be responsible for her.", "Your boyfriend is TA. You did the right thing. Consider sending your boyfriend to a shelter too.", "NTA not taking cat to vet and not buying food is abuse by neglect, you saved that cat from miserable life. Now maybe do same for yourself and dump that neglectfull asshole? His communication was abmyssal through all of that. Imagine having a kid with someone like that.", "NTA Your BF seems like a child and if he can\u2019t take care of a cat he won\u2019t be able to take care of a human baby.", "I think NTA. If he could not be bothered to feed the cat, get necessary medical care for the cat, and wasn't in a position to care for it, then finding it a safe, warm place where it will be spayed and fed and adopted out is the least of all evils. I very much understand him being mad, I would be devastated even if I *had* been an inadequate pet owner due to my own negligence (because wanting to be responsible doesn't always make us so!), but you did the best thing *for the cat*. \n\nIf it was a matter of poverty alone, I'd have gone with E S H, but it's clear that he HAS some money, enough to save up for a spay and to pay for cat food... he was just choosing not to. There are pet food pantries and charities, so if it was just money, then you would have options. But he was making his priorities clear and the cat was suffering as a result.\n\nI do think that the relationship is probably shot, though, and I think that's what you sacrificed to help the cat. You did something that hurt him and probably made yourself the villain in his eyes, maybe forever. You were *right* but it's probably easier for him to think of you as a villain than for him to face the fact that the level of care he was providing was unacceptable.", "NTA, the mistake is not dumping this guy.

Her needs and health come first almost every time.  These creatures rely on us.  Your BF showed he can't be relied on.  You were doing the work.

You deserve better.", "NTA - sounds like you made the right call OP. Your boyfriend wasn't taking any initiative to care for the cat himself and it sounds like you took all the steps necessary to have these conversations with him about it. \n\nIf anything, he isn't yet mature enough to own any animals if he can't afford to take them to the vet when they need it. I understand they can be expensive (we have pets) but it's a part of having a fur baby in your life.", "NTA. It\u2019s a stray cat, not an adopted one. If your bf isn\u2019t responsible enough for his cat, then he doesn\u2019t deserve to own the cat. \n\nEdit: Not telling him was kind of a dick move tho. I think you guys could\u2019ve talked over this a little bit more. But yeah, leaning towards NTA, but I think you should\u2019ve let him know or at least give him a warning/ultimatum. Welp just comfort him and make him forget abt his cat the best you can", "I expected this to be easy, but it isn't. It's marginal and I think that it is fair for your bf to think that you are TA at the moment, but I think NTA.\n\nIt is reasonable for you to draw a line under how much money (and time and energy) you're willing to spend on someone else's pet when they promise to look after it and then don't. Please understand that this is an accurate reflection of how your boyfriend is likely to treat other issues where your priorities are not aligned. This probably includes housework, household budgeting, and could later extend to childcare and eldercare. It's up to you whether he's worth all of that, but I know that I am not interested in dating people who promise me they will do a thing and then do not do the thing, repeatedly.", "NTA you did the best thing for the cat.\n\nHowever if this is how the man treats a cat, I wouldn\u2019t stay with him, not having it spayed and not giving it medication for fleas is highly concerning. Like what would he do for you if you were sick, or if you ended up having kids? He sounds too selfish to be with.", "NTA. If I suddenly stopped buying food for my cat or cleaning its litter, I'd be neglecting/abusing my cat.

You're TA because you are still with this dude. What are you thinking? He cares little about you which is evident in how he treated you after you did the human thing which was try to help an animal. He treats a living pet like garbage - can't be bothered to get it food, clean up after its waste, let kittens become strays, didn't care that flea bites can lead to an infection which could kill the cat.... didn't care that the cat was miserable and scratching all of the time. Didn't care that you, his girlfriend, was getting bitten all the time and spending hours deep cleaning and vacuuming. And he doesn't believe in getting a cat fixed? Are you serious?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease think about this relationship. What happens if you become pregnant? Do you think this dude is going to care at all to make sure that baby is healthy, fed and clean or would he make it your job while he plays that PS5 he used all the baby money for.

Overall, I think you gave your boyfriend fair warning and did what was best for the cat by giving it up. You were certainly right to advocate for the cat and try to get your boyfriend to be more responsible, get it spayed, take it to the vet, etc.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m concerned that surrendering an animal that doesn\u2019t belong to you to a shelter against the owner\u2019s will is some sort of theft.\n\nTo be clear, I think what you did isn\u2019t morally wrong and you\u2019re NTA.

Some people should not have pets (or kids) and that\u2019s okay, but it really sucks when they do and those animals end up suffering for it, that cat will get medical attention at the shelter and get a second chance at life so at least your ex can feel good that in a roundabout way he sorta?

He seems to have no sense of responsibility for this creature's life. He literally holds the cat's well-being in his hands, yet did absolutely nothing to care for it.

You fed her, cleaned up after her, took her to the vet for what had to have been a severe case of fleas, and got her meds. While he twiddled he thumbs and saved up for a PlayStation? How is he so heart broken when he clearly didn't give a damn about this cat? Seriously how is a PlayStation more important than the cat you're supposed to love?\n\nYou saved her by surrendering her to a good shelter. Thank you for finding a no kill picky home shelter btw. They truly look for the best places for their inhabitants. They'll make sure she finally gets spayed and all the proper care she needs before going off to a great home.\n\nHonestly I'd drop the whole boyfriend too tbh.

At least you saved 1 life.", "is it just me or has there been an influx of cats & relationships related posts", "NTA. The first red flag to me was that some of the kittens became strays. It's hard to place kittens yourself, but he could've taken them to a no kill shelter or a cat rescue rather than let a bunch of kittens become strays/feral cats.\n\nThe second red flag was his lack of action on the fleas. Fleas can lead to tapeworms in both cats and humans (though it's rare in humans as you have to swallow a flea with the tapeworm larvae to get it - but *still*) on top of being difficult to get rid of and generally maddening. And he just... left you to deal with it? WTF?\n\n(If you ever run into this situation in the future - I really hope you don't - you can kill fleas with Dawn soap. It does involve the very dangerous act of bathing a cat, but if you can gear up, it's way less expensive than getting the flea treatments from the vet.)\n\nAnyway, he's a huge AH for leaving 100% of the cat care duties to you, constantly \"forgetting\" to buy it food/litter, and putting a gaming console over the cat's health.

And he is straight-up not feeding his cat appropriately. You entirely did the right thing.

Seriously\u2026 PS5 more important than feeding and spaying \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. \n\nReading this made my blood boil and your HOPEFULLY EX boyfriend sounds like someone I would fist fight in a parking lot. \n\nHe is irresponsible, immature, selfish, and does not deserve to have a pet nor a partner. He clearly does not have the capability to CARE for anyone but himself. Including you. Including a litter of kittens. Kick that trash to the curb. Let him become a stray. \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in having animals sterilized\u201d FFS WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE IDIOT. Stupid assholes like him are why there are so many poor animals living and dying on the streets.", "Nta, you did the right thing. Also, your bf shouldn't be allowed pets if he refuses to care for them. He sounds like a selfish asshole", "Nta but why are you still with this AH. Not a good boyfriend or pet owner from what you shared.", "I HATE this man and I hope that if he does get a PS5, it falls and breaks AFTER the return period. \n\nNTA. Thank you for doing right by that poor cat. My heart breaks for those kittens that ended up as strays too. \n\nPlease do yourself a favor and ditch this loser. He\u2019s not going to do right by you. People who mistreat animals (and neglect is mistreatment - omg the fleas! In your house??) send up gigantic blinking and flashing red flags.", "He neglected the cat and probably knew you would take care of it - you are smart enough to know it was his responsibility and held him to it, which he didn\u2019t expect or like. NTA OP. Your bf\u2019s behavior as you described it is passive aggressive and ultimately harmful to your self esteem and your right to receive a caring, loving and responsible partner.\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy being alone. At first. Yet at some point you will feel the relief of not feeling emotionally repressed by this person. Take care of yourself - you are worth it.", "NTA because it wasn't even his cat. If he can't take care of it properly, he shouldn't take it in. And this wasn't a case of oh I got a pet and fell on hard times, he prioritized saving for a PS5 over the cat's health. YOU took the cat to the vet for the first time, YOU did all the work to rid it of fleas, YOU took care of daily needs...yeah, you adopted this cat, and when your AH hopefully-soon-to-be-ex boyfriend objected to having the cat spayed, you made sure it would be rehomed. You did nothing wrong except date an absolute moron. Time to fix that too.", "Girl NTA at all! \n\nYour behaving-like-a-child boyfriend prefers to buy a PS5 instead of giving basic care to a living being who's dependent on him. You warned him for months, did everything yourself for the poor cat and took good care of it. All he did was keep blaming you for spending money on a totally necessary things, instead of a PS5. \n\nYou totally should break up with him, or he'll do the the EXACT same thing if you have a baby someday. Free yourself from him now.\n\nAnd huge thanks for checking out the shelter before giving away the cat to make sure it will get a good, loving home. You're so thoughtful.", "NTA! This cat got very lucky to have you in its life. It has moved on to a new family and I hope you will also soon move on to a new boyfriend. You have shown great consideration and kindness toward an animal, now treat yourself the same and get single ASAP.", "I have never once voted NTA on a thread asking this question and never thought I would, but there\u2019s a first time for everything. You\u2019re definitely NTA. This cat (and you, for that matter) deserve much better than your bf. The fact he would put getting a PS5 over getting a cat he owned spayed is appalling to me, and the flea situation sounds worse.\n\nHe is not a responsible pet owner, and you gave him fair warning. I hope this cat gets a better life.", "NTA. Now get rid of the boyfriend. He seems pretty useless anyway. With only a part-time job and showing no responsibility towards his animal, he'd rather put his money towards some toys he can play with. He didn't even contribute to vacuuming or deep cleaning the furniture that his pet was wrecking. Drop the dead weight.", "Seriously! I was like halfway through and thinking she should take the BF to the shelter too while she's at it.", "Top comment.", "Seriously! Girl raise your standards. You had FLEAS for weeks! This guy can't bring anything to the table that is worth all this.", "Good point- this does NOT sound like a guy who should have kids!", "Not sure about the legality myself, but the fact that she had never been to the vet or been spayed and was adopted off the street leads me to believe there is no documentation of this cat being his.  The OP's vet bill that she solely paid and the fact that she primarily cared for the cat might actually make it hers.  Doesn't sound like this guy cares enough to put in any kind of effort to accomplish anything though, so she's probably off the hook anyway.", "Honestly the only legal issue that crossed my mind at the time was knowing we'd both be liable for animal cruelty if we continued to keep her in the house with no food. But I took her to the shelter because it would have been cruel to let her starve, not because of the law.  \n\nI would hope no one thinks people are allowed to abuse or neglect animals because of property rights. \n\nTagging u/sea-mobile-1518 because this is in response to them too.", "The cat was his idea. She just tried to be a good person by taking actual care of it.", "She says her bf had the cat already when she moved in.", "What?! Did you even read what she said? That is absolutely not what happened.", "Fellow \"Beautiful but only on the Inside\" here. You don't need this Waste of Oxygen to validate your worth. You are a wonderful person and you have a beautiful soul, which is what really matters. So what if men aren't interested? Who made men the judges of your worth? I don't know how old you are, but for me to get over my lack of looks, I started by listening to Meghan Trainor Me Too on repeat. \n\n https://youtu.be/qDRORgoZxZU", "I was bullied all throughout school too. When I had a persistent rash on my arms that we didn\u2019t know was caused by my allergy to detergents other kids in school called me diseased and refused to even sit in the bus seat next to me because they said I was \u201ccontaminated\u201d. I *get* what it\u2019s like to feel completely alone and wonder if it\u2019s worth it to debase yourself for what you can tell yourself is affection. And it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really really not. You are worth more than this. You are worth more than a man who will starve an animal because he wants video games. You are worth more than a man who doesn\u2019t give a shit about a flea infestation. You are worth more than a man that will lie to you for months. You are worth more than a man that will yell at you for taking care of what *should* have been his responsibility. You are worth more than being a bangmaid. You may not be beautiful but you don\u2019t need to be beautiful to be worth being treated with love and compassion. And this man? Will not. He will not and he never will. Dump him and know that you are stronger and better than he\u2019ll ever be.", "Ugly or not (or even thinking you are) doesn't mean you have to settle, boo. Guys like this latch on to women like you because they know YOU think you can't do better. So they are abusive and they dangle dumb shit in front of you and you take it because you're terrified of being alone.\n\nBe alone for the right reasons, not with someone for the wrong ones. One of you in this relationship needs to love you.", "I don't need anyone to validate my worth but I do want a partner like everyone else.", "Maybe not just this one, okay?", "Well, that's kinda an oxymoron.\n\nNTA in this situation, but please consider self care and working on your self esteem because he didn't deserve you. You got this.\n\nBeing alone is way better than being with a guy like him, but history will keep repeating if you don't change your outlook on yourself.", "Get some self-respect. It's better to be single than to waste time and energy on an asshole like this.", "It may not feel like it now, but you are better off. He's a disgusting selfish person. I saw your other comments and I understand why you're upset and stuck with him but it 100% is not worth it to be with someone like that. He would never put you first and if he's still this way at 35 then there's truly no hope for him. You'll find someone better. I guarantee it.", "He broke up with me anyway.", "Now you can take your time to carefully look for a better one", "It might not feel like it now, but that's the best thing that could happen to you. This was a glimpse into your future with him...his personal desires would be more important than others' well being, he would yell instead of try to find a solution and reach a compromise, and ultimately let you do literally all the work. You deserve way better!", "Good riddance!\n\nEdit to add: you don't have to be beautiful to deserve to be treated well in a relationship. Please remember this op."]}
