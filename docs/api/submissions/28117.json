I've broken sturdier things than a futon with less than a combined 300 lbs.", "NTA,without a doubt he crossed a personal boundary and should pay to replace the bed and/or mattress. That's just nasty to expect you to sleep in their bodily fluids. If you don't say something, he will do it again if you replace it with your own money.", "Nta. Put a sheet down man!", "Nta! I get not thinking straight in the heat of the moment, but he should have cleaned it up himself instead of just leaving it like that for you to find.

But you seem to have a\u2026 pretty sex positive household, shall we say, and you say you would have likely given him the ok if he had asked. So it seems like a bit of overkill to ask him to replace the futon just because he had sex on it.\n\nYou made a big deal of his hookup\u2019s weight, saying it would be relevant, and then it wasn\u2019t. I thought this was leading up to the futon getting broken (in which case her weight would still not be relevant, really). You also don\u2019t actually state that there was a mess or stains as a result of their sex. It really comes across as though you were grossed out by this specific sexual partner and that\u2019s why you want the futon replaced.", "In-between yta. And nta. \nAsk for him to clean it. Then invest in a plastic sheet.\n\nFun fact not all hotels replace your bedspread before you arrive  \ud83d\ude09  \nIf they had a single over night stay and no signs ot stains, you may have already rolled in other strangers bodily fluid.. hotels are grubby", "NTA.

Wouldn\u2019t clean it either.", "Why would this person's weight be relevant to whether or not you're the asshole?  You keep mentioning the twin bed but again that has nothing to do with whether or not you're the asshole.  This is a 3 line story.\n\n\"My roommate had sex on my futon without asking. He didn't put a sheet down and got bodily fluids on it.  Am I the asshole if I ask him to replace it?\"\n\nNo obviously you wouldn't be, but god, the belabored description of this woman that was allegedly going to be relevant to the story and never was -- YTA.  \n\nAlso, then you say if he had asked you would have been fine with it... So I guess what you need to say to your roommate giving your concerns is \"hey I'm fine with you destroying my stuff so you can have a hook up as long as you ask first, but since you didn't ask first I wanted a new futon\"?  Weird.", "YTA for body shaming.  Nowhere in the post does his date's weight matter.  The futon isn't broken, and your description of her... I'm insulted for her.

It wouldn't have worked. So they used his futon without asking and now their smells and stains are all through it. \n\nIt's really all there if you read it coherently but you're refusing to acknowledge parts that are there for your strawmans. \n\nAlso you can have a sex positive household while so respecting your roommates space . Me personally, would never ever, think of doing something like that but again, that's me..\n\n\nnta.", "Yeah if he\u2019d come to me like \u201chey do me a solid I\u2019m trying to get laid\u201d I\u2019d help a brother out, or even after the fact apologizing, but just going at it on my furniture felt a little uncalled for. \n\nThe weight was relevant because it explains why they couldn\u2019t just use his bed as per usual hookups and had to go put the futon down.

I'm pretty sure like minded individuals would agree it's gross for fucking anyone to smash in your bed or couch let alone a girl who can't properly wipe her ass or her stomach rolls.

You could have just said they are both large people, and the story would have been exactly the same. Instead you dwelled on her size, spending more time discussing that than you did the sex they had. YTA.", "Well... presumably he saw her but didn't observe the sex.  Hard to see how he could have given more detail there.", "OP could have written considerably less regarding the woman's appearance.", "It's like two sentences.  OP gives the futon an equal amount of description."]}
