At that point, she\u2019s just being called out. \u201cYou did this. I know about it, and I\u2019m not okay with it. You\u2019re damn right I\u2019m unsupportive, but you already knew that, since you never asked for my consent to begin with.

While your wording could have been better, you were understandably angry at these huge violation of your privacy.\n\nWhen you break up with her, I would suggest requesting that she remove those videos of you and tell her that you might explore legal options if she doesn\u2019t. Idk if what she has done is illegal (it might be depending on your jurisdiction) but the threat of legal action is often quite motivating.", "NTA. \n\nSure, you weren\u2019t nice with your words, but sometimes a spade is a spade. Doesn\u2019t make you an AH for pointing it out, especially when she was trying to weaponize her tears and blame-shift. Hard pass to all of that toxic behavior.", "NTA.

Gaslighting Narcissists don't change for the better.", "NTA. Run do not walk. That would blow the word trust out of the water.", "NTA run. Other ppls attention is what she craves. Ive been in this exact relationship before. It ends poorly for everyone.", "NTA. Filming you without your knowledge is a huge violation. It's illegal in many states. Get away from her. You deserve better.", "NTA, What an incredible violation of privacy. I doubt I would ever speak to a partner again after they did that.", "NTA. She invaded your privacy while publicly mocking you in your most vulnerable moments. This is a huge betrayal that can't be taken back. She doubled down by trying to make you feel bad about her making you feel bad. \n\nYou said some unpleasant words, which is more than understandable given the circumstances.", "NTA \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "If you are willing to call someone names like that do you really even want to be in a relationship with them/love them enough to be in a healthy relationship? That being said, she has repeatedly violated your privacy & shared very intimate moments which is just beyond beyond creepy.  I think it\u2019s time to move on.", "NTA. She was horribly cold, calculating and cruel for recording and posting the videos of you.  Pay a lawyer a couple hundred bucks to send her a cease and desist letter telling her to delete the posted videos.  And if you didn\u2019t realize it, this is a dumbable offense. I don\u2019t know how you could possibly trust her again.", "NTA - Depending what state you live in, you could sue her or press charges. There\u2019s a handful of states that require two-party consent on being recorded. But in general It\u2019s illegal for someone to film what you say or do when you have a reasonable expectation of privacy, whether in a public space or at home. I would call the police and press charges.", "NTA. She had no right to record and publicly post you without your knowledge or consent. Dump her and let her post videos of herself crying about that.", "Sue her", "NTA. While I do think you may have been a bit harsh with the verbal slurs, you had good reason to. No one, even your partner, has a right to invade your privacy without your consent.", "Nta that\u2019s a dealbreaker, ladies", "NTA run away, what a gross violation of privacy and trust.

You\u2019re just a prop", "NTA.\n\nWell, it sure looks like you're burning the bridge and breaking up -- which is likely the right thing to do in this mess, given her reaction. If you thought there was something to salvage, this probably wouldn't be the right way to go about doing it, but that's a discussion for another subreddit.\n\nBest of luck to you in proceeding.", "NTA - the relationship is over as she seemingly has no respect for you and your privacy, and honestly I doubt anyone would have any respect for her after being recorded at intimate moments and posted for\u2026 clout? Relationship goals??", "Your EX-girlfriend.\n\nNTA", "NTA. There are boundaries, and she crossed them. Now she's gaslighting you. She deletes tiktok or you need to be done, she has gone too far.", "NTA. Backed into a corner so she tried to gaslight you bro. Not sure what she was going for though. Did she want to save her TikTok\u2019s? Did she want to save her relationship? Very poorly handled on her part, as she would have had better success with either of these two by apologizing and asking if you would like her to delete it all.", "NTA. She knew she goofed which is why she pleaded victim in an instant. My advice - leave her. Thats some psychological warefare youre gonna put up with if you dont.", "NTA. She's been secretly recording you and you had no idea. That's so bizarre. You are dating an npc. Get out now. It's even more appauling given the age, she's not a teenager.", "Nta bro leave her now invasion of privacy recording without telling red flags get out", "I mean.. the truth hurts\n\nNTA", "ESH. Your GF might have even committed a crime but I don't think you handled it the correct way, you don't need to lash out and start naming calling.

Hopefully she's your ex-gf at this point and you can just move on.", "ESH\n\nTo be clear. Your girlfriend clearly violated your privacy. What she did was not okay and her response says a lot about her. \n\nbut it\u2019s also not okay to call people names even if it\u2019s coming from hurt and anger. You were also kind of an asshole in your response, even if you were upset with good reason.", "Fuck that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. I love how when you confronted her she was like \u201cstop accusing me\u201d. I\u2019d report all her videos multiple times and have people you know report them", "NTA and if you can, talk to a lawyer about legal options.", "NTA \n\nYou should record her being broken up with and see if she still likes the clout.", "NTA Her actions were really messed up. You never agreed to have these private parts of your life recorded. She invaded your privacy and instead of taking accountability when you confronted her, she insisted that you were the one at fault. That is a deeply concerning response. She\u2019s expecting you to have sympathy for her\u2014 because she\u2019s going through the tough time of you telling her that she invaded your privacy? Hard no.", "Check local recording laws and show them to her if you\u2019re in a 2 party consent state. What she did was wrong and I would demand she take them down. This is a massive violation of your privacy and trust. NTA", "NTA\n\nDude.... Please dump your GF\n\nThis is a major violation of trust and privacy. I can't believe she recorded you without your permission while you were crying at a funeral, half naked, etc.\n\nI don't know the laws of video recording and posting them online, but you typically shouldn't/can't do it without the other person's permission.\n\nShe is a major dick.", "Holy crap I had serious anxiety just reading this. NTA at all; although it was harsh, to be completely honest what you said to her is probably pretty mild compared to how I would have reacted. And she has some serious balls accusing you of abuse. For the love of all things holy, please dump your girlfriend. This is a MASSIVE violation of privacy and trust-probably one of the worst I've read on here so far. And please check consent laws in your state because you may be able to take action. It's always legal to film in public when there is no expectation of privacy but in some states it's not legal to film with audio without someone's consent when there is an expectation of privacy. I am so incredibly sorry this happened to you.\n\nEdited to add an extra sentence and fix grammar.", "NTA, and check your consent laws about being filmed for your state. You could legally force her to delete them. RIP your relationship.", "i mean\u2026 you\u2019re in the right, she absolutely is violating your trust and privacy. NTA for being upset, i get emotions may be running high but the word choices you used take away from the point you were trying to get across and enable her to claim you called her nasty insults and possibly side step the real issue of her filming you. NTA, but maybe be more careful with your words choices in the future", "NTA.", "Uh, your choice is words is assholish, but you are NTA for being recorded without your permission.", "NTA.\n\nI know it should be ESH for the way you spoke to her,but I can't stand people that film others and post without their knowledge.", "NTA. Your words weren't the best choice, but you absolutely have every reason to as angry as you are. What she did was unconscionable and unforgivable. And accusing you of being abusive? WTF was she thinking??!!! Run fast and run far. Report the videos on TokTok and demand they be taken down.", "NTA\n\nTbf, that is nearing verbal abuse, but you were understandably upset. As long as you don't typically call her names like that, she doesn't have much to stand on.\n\nI would suggest asking yourself if you want to be with this person. I would also suggest downloading the videos if you haven't already. Just as proof that these things did happen.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have recorded you without your permission. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s even illegal in some states and countries. She\u2019s only upset because she knew she was wrong and is being called out on it. If she had approached you ahead of time so you could consent to certain videos that would be supportive. No clue how she thinks being supportive means allowing her to secretly record you without Consent or being able to view it back and give the ok. And A FUNERAL. JfC. I\u2019d be thinking long and hard about if I could trust her in a relationship after such a breach of trust\u2026.", "NTA. She sounds like a horrible, narcissistic, cruel creep. You could piss out a window and hit a better woman. Get as far away from that beast as you can, and on your way out the door tell her she has 24 hours to take down every video.", "Nta it sounds like a huge violation of trust in a relationship.
