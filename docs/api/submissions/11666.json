NTA at all; although it was harsh, to be completely honest what you said to her is probably pretty mild compared to how I would have reacted. And she has some serious balls accusing you of abuse. For the love of all things holy, please dump your girlfriend. This is a MASSIVE violation of privacy and trust-probably one of the worst I've read on here so far. And please check consent laws in your state because you may be able to take action.

People can be pissed and not yell whore, I think.", "Having the thought to record your bf crying at a funeral and then posting it online, without him knowing, is such a massive red flag of no empathy, it\u2019s not even funny. How little care do you have to have for other people? Run.", "It's not enough to pull sociopathic crap like this but to then call OP unsupportive and abusive when he confronts her is another blatant character flaw. No accountability.", "that's DARVO, baybeeee", "It\u2019s so abusive of you to be yelling at me for abusing your trust and privacy!!\n\nSome days I really wish social media would just vanish without a trace. People do scary things just for internet attention. I can\u2019t imagine the things I\u2019d say if I found out someone did this to me, man.", "Federal protections for what exactly? I don\u2019t see how anything the gf did is criminal.", "Looks like OP tried to confront this reasonably and then she turned on the waterworks, victim mentality and then called him an abuser. I don't blame him for getting angry past this.", "The lawyer thing is not wrong to tell him to do, considering she violated his trust and put up half-naked videos of him online without him knowing. That's a criminal offense right there. As for the breakup advice, what would you tell a friend who had their privacy invaded by a significant other and then they tried to turn it back on them in an emotionally abusive way?", "I depends on what state they live in. Some states have a \u201cone party\u201d law so if the op\u2019s girlfriend was in the recording as well she can technically give permission for the recording and op wouldn\u2019t be able to fight it.", "She has made the choice to value her social media attention and following over her partner. \n\nThen to make it worse, when confronted she resorts to calling him unsupportive and abusive. This woman has no accountability", "1. I could never watch videos like that because I would feel so uncomfortable when people are this vulnerable, and it's usually clear that they aren't aware they are being filmed. \n2. I had my fair share of exes, but this would be an automatic dealbreaker for me. I don't care if I was with someone for a decade. If they did this with me, they are getting dumped.", "That\u2019s not a red flag. \nThat\u2019s the lights & sirens on a firetruck.", "And then she had the nerve to darvo him? Getting some serious sociopathy vibes from the gf. Fuck that.", "There\u2019s not much more someone can do to show how little they care about their SO. Finding one of their worst moments, filming them and posting that video on social media without their knowledge or consent is pretty fucking low.", "Yeah I understand why he got angry after that. It's difficult to argue with someone who pulled the victim card.", "Exactly. Only cares about herself.", "Agreed. I know it makes it harder to find excuses to leave when you\u2019re already at the point of living together, but if there\u2019s ever a good one, this is it.", "I just had my breakup less than a month ago after being with my ex for 5 years and we lived together for 1.5 years.\n\nYes, the breakup was hard and I didn't want it to happen. But the OP has a 100% valid reason to dump this girl."]}
