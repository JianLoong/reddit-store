My gf starts complaining about how they shouldn't have been announced as going if they're not going to show up. I agreed it was annoying but pointed out we still get to try food from the places we wanted. She still spent most of the day complaining that the stalls weren't there. Then we went to look around some shops and she complained about some of them being closed even though it was to be expected. \n\nOur train home was delayed by 2 mins and she started complaining about that and how awful it is. I said yeah its annoying but at least its only 2 mins but she continued complaining. It's started to become physically draining to sit and listen to when I'm trying to remain positive and actually enjoy myself. When we got home I told her I was tired and just wanted to be on my own for a bit. She asked what was wrong and I told her that she seems to be complaining about everything lately and it's becoming draining especially when we're making plans for things we're looking forward to yet she spends most of the activities actually complaining. \n\nShe said I was being unfair to her and that she was allowed to complain but I just said its looking like she just looks for things to complain about. I mentioned the food stalls and the fact she complained for over an hour that stalls weren't there that she wasn't going to go to anyway. I said when you're trying to enjoy something and the other person is constantly finding things to complain about it pretty much means you can't enjoy the activity anymore because there's a negative atmosphere.

Sometimes there are other things that are going on, and that's might be what's actually causing her to be annoyed about everything.", "NTA. Constant complaining IS draining. Obviously I only know your side of the story and how you wrote it but if she truly is complaining about anything and everything, you need to figure out what's caused this change in her. A calm sit down to talk would be a good place to start. Hope it gets better OP", "NTA sounds exhausting. Maybe just have a serious sit down and ask if she is ok.. maybe there is a root cause to her change of outlook.", "NTA I actually didn\u2019t know people did this until I was 22, stayed the night at a friends house and that\u2019s pretty much all she did. At the house just complaining but still fun when going out. \n\nAnytime my friends complain they also make joke or poke fun at their struggles. It\u2019s always felt more like a fun/sad discussion, than a trauma dump or constant negativity.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting and she brings you down when you're just trying to enjoy yourself. Then she makes you sound like the asshole for not sitting there and listening to her constant complaining. Clearly she has no intentions of working on this, so I'd say go find yourself someone more positive and be happy and enjoy yourself", "NTA. I had a friend like this, that I just had to start distancing myself from as everything was negative; we couldn't have a conversation about a single topic that she didn't turn negative and it just got to me all the time. I can't imagine how draining that must be when it's your SO.\n\nHave you tried bringing this up with her at a time when it's calm and your just chilling at home, rather than straight after an event?", "NTA\n\nSome people are so negative they suck the joy right out of you.\n\nShe sounds like an energy vampire. Just so you know, it's highly unlikely she'll change. I think you just started to notice this but she's always been more negative than positive.", "NTA, you communicated your feelings on the matter in what sounds like a healthy way.\n\nJust a thought, though: her constant conplaining may be indicative of something else in her life that is making her miserable.  I know I do that sometimes, and sadly the people who suffer are the ones I'm closest to. I can hear myself complaining and whinging and nagging, but I cant actually stop til I figure out what aspect of my life is making me miserable and negative. \n\nNot sure your relationship or investment in said relationship, but maybe if there's a way to help identify whatever the anxiety/grumpy-source is, it could help the situation. \n\nI've been much happier since I realized this is a thing I do, and when I notice I'm doing it I step back and try to figure out what the issue is so I can fix that, instead of just picking fights/whining about whatever annoys me.", "NTA. I noticed same about me and modified my conversations.", "NTA \"I mentioned the food stalls and the fact she complained for over an hour that stalls weren't there that she wasn't going to go to anyway. I said when you're trying to enjoy something and the other person is constantly finding things to complain about it pretty much means you can't enjoy the activity anymore because there's a negative atmosphere. She said I was unreasonable and that she is allowed to complain and that it feels like I'm attacking her for voicing her opinion.\"  \n\nSo she is allowed to complain about things that do not even impact her plans but you are not allowed to mention your opinion or how this makes you feel because \"She said I was unreasonable and that she is allowed to complain and that it feels like I'm attacking her for voicing her opinion.\"", "NTA she is abusing her right to complain. Plus she doesn't complain to the people responsible for whatever she doesn't like so things can get better,  she complains to you. And it doesn't seem like she wants your opinion so what's the point? That's why is draining, there is no stop to it, no solution, no help you can give. You have the right to remove yourself from a toxic situation. She has to realize it's bad for her too", "NTA.", "NTA. Everything you\u2019ve said is both true and relatable. I love my mom dearly but she is a lot like your girlfriend: everything is a catastrophe, minor inconveniences are the worst thing imaginable, blah blah blah. I frequently have to take mini-breaks from talking to her because the constant stream of negativity is both boring and draining to listen to. I\u2019ve also told her that in certain situations, the appropriate response is simply to suck it up and shut up before you ruin the day/evening/experience for everyone around you. I\u2019m sorry to say that unless your girlfriend has a mental health issue that\u2019s causing her to act like this, it may just be a part of her personality. \n\nI personally have an internal rule that, for every complaint I vocalize, I have to find three positive things to mention. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not something you can force someone to adhere to but you can stop engaging and try to call her bluff when she\u2019s complaining too much. \n\nExample:\n\nGf: this sucks. I hate this. \n\nYou: that\u2019s unfortunate. I think it would be best for us to leave if you\u2019re having such a bad time. \n\nOr\n\nGf: *complains*\n\nYou: that\u2019s too bad. So, did you hear about *redirects conversation*?\n\nBoth options will probably piss her off but if she\u2019s allowed to voice negative opinions constantly, you\u2019re allowed to implement boundaries on how to deal with them.", "NTA.  It sounds like hell.\n\nYou two need to see a couples counselor; specifically, to discuss communication styles.  She is certainly allowed to vent, but she needs to be made aware that this UNENDING stream of dumping is unfair to you.  She will be more likely to accept this coming from a neutral third party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's tiring to listen to people vent all the time.\n\nMaybe try to sat her down when she cooled down and explain to her it's not a problem with her voicing her disappoinment but her not letting go of small inconveniences", "NTA - I love the irony of her complaining about you saying she's complaining.", "NTA - The older I get, the fewer people I can tolerate. I\u2019m a glass half full person. I\u2019m not going to waste my precious time on earth complaining. There is always something to complain about, but more importantly, there is always something to good to think about instead.", "NTA: This kinda thing does spiral and no one likes to be sucked in. I\u2019m really sensitive to this kinda thing and I get hella depressed when folks are consistently negative.\n\nIt sounds like she needs therapy, some time to vent. It just seems like there\u2019s some thing under the surface that actually bothering her and then everything else is just irritating. But who knows, there are some people that just like to complain when there\u2019s no drama to focus on.", "NTA and consider carefully if you can deal with this long term. My husband is like this and it is exhausting.", "NTA- however I sympathize with your partner.  Complaints can become a really bad habit and get to the point where it doesn't feel like complaining, it feels like conversation.  You are absolutely not the asshole for bringing it up that it's draining.  If you didn't tell her, she'd never notice or try to improve.\n\nI saw a comment mentioning methods to redirect complaint conversations, and that's a good idea.  It might also help to inject some general positivity. Not things that dispute the complaint, or it might feel dismissive of her upset, but just mention things when they go well or make you happy.  It can also help to end each day by both of you listing 3 things that were good or even just not bad about the day- maybe starting a journal. \n\nNow having said all that... that's a lot of work to go through to have less negativity in your relationship, and this won't work at all if she isn't willing to try improving her negative outlook.  I'm not saying that you have to go this route, just giving you ideas that might help break that habit in the long run, if this is something you both want to do.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Sounds like you phrased it diplomatically enough.\n\nConstant negativity in your life is a serious drag.  My mental health has legitimately improved a great deal now that I basically completely avoid social media.", "NTA.  Constant complaining is a symptom of depression.  Perhaps she should talk to her doctor about it.", "NTA but it sounds like that's how she expresses her thoughts and it's something you can't take, so might be time to split. She does have every right to complain if that's how she processes things but you have the right to not have to hear it", "NTA. Here comes Debbie Downer. Tell her to complain to someone else. She will find it difficult. That attitude makes it hard to enjoy yourself.", "I call these people \u201cenergy vampires\u201d.  How you deal with what life gives you is a choice.  If your choice is to complain about everything, bringing the people around you down, then my choice is not to spend time with you.", "Sounds like you are dating my aunt. In which case: I warned you well over a year ago Jack that she was a negative Nancy and you were not going to like her once her facade wore off.\n\nNTA even if it isn\u2019t you Jack.", "NTA\n\nI've been dealing with this for decades with my covert narcissistic \"mother\".\n\nIt is 100% exhausting listening to complaints 24/7.  Even when events/actions have absolutely *nothing* to do with them, complaints.  She even complains in her sleep!\n\nAt this point, I'm surprised that she hasn't asked me to pre-chew her food, since chewing is exhausting.  \n\nLike physically opening a regular standard envelope is to exhausting for her \"they\" should make it easier...\n\nI have to add, she has NO physical ailments or limitations that make doing regular everyday actions difficult.", "NTA - I wonder if something else is going on? Is she under extra stress at work? Is she feeling depressed?", "NTA - While she is allowed to complain and be negative if that is what flaots her boat you absolutely have the right to remove yourself from that situation. her right to voice her opinion does not outweigh your right to voice your opinion and find positive moments.", "YTA.", "Some people love to complain. It is their nature. I can't be around those people.  It is up to you whether you can. NTA", "nta", "NTA. Sorry to say that the only solution I found that helped my partner to stop complaining all the time to me was just to make her my ex. It\u2019s exhausting and like you, if it was every now and then you\u2019d get on with it but when it\u2019s constant, it literally sucks the joy out of being around them at all.

This would spoil any day out for me too, how are you supposed to enjoy yourselves with a negativity spiral going on around you? I realised that my mental health is better when I look to enjoy myself rather than look to criticise. Anything in life can be criticised, if that's how you want to approach it.

You are also allowed to not want to listen to her complain. \n\nEveryone is entitled to their opinions, but that doesn't mean those opinions are without consequence, and similarly, your partner can take up all her time complaining, but that doesn't mean she can do it consequence free. \n\nThis is one of my biggest pet peeves. If it is cold out, you complain it is cold and either fix it (get a jacket) or change plans because of the weather, if dinner was gross, you vow to never eat there again, but to harp on unchangeable things just ruins the day and the event. I'm happy to adjust plans and preferences when someone complains, but to complain over stuff that can't be controlled or fixed is just such a waste of energy and the very short lives we have.", "NTA she sounds so fucking annoying", "Info - when do you get to complain?  She doesn't even allow you to complain once at home about all the complaining you had to listen to?\n\nHow long are you planning to live like this?   Sounds exhausting.", "I wonder if the root cause of her negative attitude is that a dynamic has been created in their relationship where she voices every tiny complaint and OP tries to make it all better. Like perhaps she's become addicted to this type of attention from OP.\n\nMaybe OP should just agree with her complaints--things like, \"yeah, I noticed that too\" or \"yeah, you'd think they could get the trains on schedule,\" etc. That might shut her down a bit.", "Would you mind explaining why you think that?", "NTA\n\n> It's started to become physically draining to sit and listen to when I'm trying to remain positive and actually enjoy myself. \n\nBut unless you're leaking blood or peeing yourself, that's still not **_physically_** draining. \n\nIt's *emotionally* draining.", "NTA and tell her now on the flip side you are voicing your opinion and she should be able to handle you complaining about her complaining as you were patient though out her complaining all day at least you are doing it in private when the day is over and you both can go your separate ways for the night.", ">she complained for over an hour that stalls weren't there that she wasn't going to go to anyway\n\nYou have the patience of a saint.
