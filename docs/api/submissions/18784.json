My boyfriend and his ex have split custody of Alex, and I see him occasionally when I visit my boyfriend. \r  \n\r  \nLast week, it was my boyfriend's turn to have Alex, but he was called into work for an emergency. He then dropped off Alex at my place and asked me to look after him that day. I work from home but I had an important meeting, so I told him that I couldn't watch Alex the entire day, but I didn't mind if he entertained himself in another room while I was in the meeting. \r  \n\r  \nIn the morning, I left Alex with a coloring book and pencils in another room while I joined my meeting. However, during the meeting, I suddenly heard Alex crying, so I stepped out to see what was going on. To my surprise, I found that he had opened all the kitchen cabinets and made a mess throwing food everywhere, searching for his favorite dinosaur cereal. When I checked, I realised we were out of that cereal. Alex, who was aware of where I kept the cereal, became extremely upset and started crying and screaming.\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked as I had never seen Alex behave that way and tried to offer him a different cereal, but he continued crying even harder. With my meeting going on, I sternly told Alex to stop crying and gave him two options: eat the cereal I provided or have his lunch early if he was really hungry. Alex didn't choose either option but stopped crying after I scolded him and gave him the TV remote, so I returned to my meeting. \r  \n\r  \nWhen the meeting ended, I found Alex still watching TV and appearing much calmer than before. We had lunch together, and I assumed he was upset earlier due to hunger. I then had him help me clean up the mess he made in the kitchen. Eventually, my boyfriend arrived to pick up Alex and drop him off at his mom's place. I told him about Aex's screen time and he told me not to worry.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday, Alex's mom called me and she blew up on me, accusing me of child neglect. Apparently, Alex had told her about what happened during the day I looked after him, and she was furious that I left him crying to attend a meeting and scolded him. She also expressed surprise that I had taken care of Alex that day, as my boyfriend hadn't told her, and she said he knew I wasn't allowed to be responsible for their son. She claimed that I undermined her parenting style by saying letting him watch TV for more than an hour, and now she struggles to enforce that boundary at home. I ended up hanging up on her and shared the incident with my boyfriend. However, he is taking her side, insisting that I should have prioritized Alex's emotional needs over my meeting and demanding that I apologize to her, given that she is currently not speaking to me. I genuinely don't think I am in the wrong here, I looked after Alex as a favour and did the best I could around my work day, but I just want an unbiased opinion to see if I am TA.", "created_utc": 1685711107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yc8km/aita_for_parenting_my_boyfriends_son/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can\u2019t seem to make up their minds about what the actual issue is: they firstly accuse you of stepping in to parent the child they forcibly left in your care, then they are angry that you reprimanded him for behaviour that was out of line and juvenile for a seven year old. That behaviour is more like how a toddler would act. You aren\u2019t his parent or his babysitter and they never should have left him in your care once they knew you had to prioritise your job. If I were you I would have a serious talk with your partner about this. It\u2019s not your job to mind his child and to have him throw it in your face when you don\u2019t parent him the way he does is wrong. Also, ganging up on you with his ex-wife is problematic.", ">he is taking her side, insisting that I should have prioritized Alex's emotional needs over my meeting and demanding that I apologize to her\n\nWOW, NTA. If he is so prioritizing his son, he should stay with him instead of work. He thinks his work is more important than yours and his ex is more important than you. I would take it as RED FLAG and reconsider relationship.", "NTA.\n\n> as my boyfriend hadn't told her, and she said he knew I wasn't allowed to be responsible for their son\n\nIf they have split custody of Alex, it means Dad is fully capable of making arrangements for childcare. But even if this isn't the case, it's something she should take with him, not you. \n\nYou were up front and honest about limitations as a babysitter. You straight up told him what was supposed to happen during your meeting, and now he's shocked that's what happened?\n\nNo, sounds like he tried to keep it secret from his ex and now that she found out, he's just using the opportunity to scapegoat you.", "NTA - \"neglect\" is dramatic, to say the very least. your boyfriend knew you had work and he knew that his kid wouldn't get round the clock attention. if he has that much of an issue, he should have taken the day off work to look after his kid.", "Yikes. NTA. If your boyfriend wasn\u2019t comfortable with \u201cAlex entertaining himself in the other room\u201d during your meeting, then he should\u2019ve made other arrangements.", "WHAT.\n\nYou were forced to babysit even though you had to work, and I'm guessing for free, and you get told off for making it through without damage to the kid? (just your kitchen)\n\nAre people really walking this earth so entitled and angry? I don't mean to be rude but this almost sounds made up.\n\nIf not, NTA", "He's 7, not 2. When he's under his father's care, his father is allowed to have someone else watch the kid if he can't. He doesn't need full undivided attention at that age. Honestly, you shouldn't even need her number. Have her text your boyfriend and she can scream at him, and he can document outburst for future reference. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe is old enough he shouldn't be throwing a fit just because he can't have his preferred cereal. You took him as a favour and made your boyfriend aware you had a meeting. \n\nThis is on him, not you.", "NTA, I would break up with the boyfriend too. Dating a parent is hard, it's even harder when the other parent is giving you a hard time. \n\nYou don't want those issues.", "Block her calls. She can deal with your boyfriend, her actual co-parent.", "Um. Consider finding a new boyfriend.", "NTA it sounds like you did a great job under the circumstances. The mother owes you an apology and so does your boyfriend.", "NTA. He should have taken the day off. Not expect you to forego a meeting. He's the parent here. The fact that he so blatantly demands you put his son above your work and income is rather entitled.", "You were thrust in the role of a babysitter and every babysitter I know would have had a cow about what Alex did, and his timing was atrocious (as is often the case with WFH and children ;) )\n\nI agree with others - this is a BF issue. Don't take calls from ex any longer.", "NTA. Kids learn very quickly that there are different rules for behavior with different people and at different places. You just showed Alex a reasonable way to deal with his hunger and frustration. If his mother has problems with his behavior, it's a result of her 7 years with him, and not your single afternoon.\n\n\n\nAlso, you may want to reconsider the boyfriend, who feels entitled to drop off his child for you to babysit, without warning, and expect you to drop your business (why is his work more important than yours?) to entertain his child.", "NTA\n\nThis is why there is a stigma around single parents. Nobody wants to take the burden of another's child.", "NTA, I think you handled the situation really well. It sounds like his mother spoils him a lot and then we he doesnt get what he wants, he throws a tantrum. \n\nOnly thing is that your boyfriend probably should have discussed with his mother that he's leaving him with you for a while.", "NTA. If it was so important that their craptastic parenting style be followed, they should have am emergency person on hand to parent in their style. Otherwise, by leaving the child in your care unannounced, they accept your style.\n\nIt sounds like the mother is a control-freak. It sounds like the poor kid lacks structure and discipline. It sounds like a nightmare situation to be getting involved in. And, if the bf doesn't back you up, what kind of bf is he?", "NTA.  you were caught in the middle of an impossible situation and handled it best you could.  Neglect is way too harsh a word, you behaved appropriately.  Even if the scolding wasnt okay in his or her eyes, they put you in that situation.", "NTA. You did your bf a huge favor unexpectedly on a work day.\n\nYour job is your priority during work hours and if they ask again, the answer is no.\n\nETA your business ingratitude is a problem here", "NTA, but your boyfriend sure is!", "NTA. He\u2019s their kid. The mom accused you of prioritizing your work over her son. You did. With good reason. And it seems like that\u2019s exactly what she and the kid\u2019s father did as well! So why would she judge you for that? Also, did you know you\u2019re not allowed to watch the kid? I mean if she wants to be angry she should be angry at the father for ditching him and not telling her.", "NTA. Run. Far away and quickly. You\u2019ve done your boyfriend a last minute favour and it\u2019s been spat back in your face. I personally wouldn\u2019t be allowing this to happen again so the next time BF has last minute childcare issues you send him straight back to his ex. But it would also be wise to consider making him your ex while you\u2019re at it. Ungrateful chap that he is.", "This is what you should do: Promise them both this will never happen again since you will never, under any circumstance, ever babysit this brat again. NTA.", "NTA, you did your bf a huge favor by watching his son even though he knew you had to work. I'm sure Jr probably embellished some key elements of his day with you and minimized his role in trashing your kitchen to his mother. If you stay in this relationship, I would have a sit down with my bf and set some very clear boundaries about his son and his ex. You aren't the ringmaster of that circus.", "NTA how is someone gonna demand you make their child priority after asking you for a favor? You don't have children and nor do you speak to the mother about screen times etc. Also they just skip over the fact that he tossed out all of this food in your kitchen and you were trying to attend a work meeting you know for the job that helps pay your bills. if they don't like it dont ask you to help out anymore or just end the relationship", "NTA \nA 7 year old should be able to entertain themselves in the next room while in a work meeting.\nBf didn\u2019t have an issue until ex made it an issue.\nHonestly I would refuse to look after him again.", "NTA - the mom probably didn\u2019t get the real story from an upset 7 year old.\n\nThe real AH is your boyfriend:\n1. He should\u2019ve told mom where Alex was that day. I\u2019m sure that added to her anger. \n\n2. He\u2019s throwing you under the bus. I don\u2019t believe his ex knows exactly how everything happened.\n\n3. He knew you had work and expected you to drop everything to watch his son?", "Nta your boyfriend sounds like a walking red flag", "This is breakup worthy. NTA", "What 7 year old blows up about something like that? Is he neurodivergent? If not, he sounds like a spoiled little shit", "NTA. Although it's not really your place to parent him, you had to do that. \"Neglect\" is very dramatic.", "Your parenting skills are terrible, yet its not your child and you didnt ask for... so NTA.", "Bf is the ah. But you never let a seven years old unsupervised. And he was crying and made a mess because he needed the adult... And you scolded him for your own fail. Mum is right to be angry. But the biggest ah is your bf. Then you. For agreeing to watch a kid when you obv not fit for it. You don't let a kid you don't know alone... You should have put some camera... What if he open the windows and climb over it, or start an electric installation..", "Esh. You are not the mother of that child.

He is not your kid and you took very good care of him while at work (guess your bf forgot that part, huh?), just beucause you are working from home people tend to assume that is not \"real work\" or that you can skip it any time, no true AT ALL. \"Momma bear\" might be taking it out on you her frustrations about her ex and you and your bf should talk about it so you can set YOUR OWN boundaries regarding all of this.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is the problem.  He should be thanking you for stepping in for him during an emergency and apologizing for his son wrecking your kitchen.

Your hopefully Ex boyfriend and his ex are though. Why is his work more important than yours?? Since when is it okay for his ex to call and tell you off and then YOU have to apologize to her?

He's  7 a full-blown screaming tantrum, and destruction of your kitchen over cereal is slightly unexpected and would warrant being scolded. \n\n2.  Did your BF just expect to dump HIS kid on you, and you take off work? This man doesn't have much respect for you or your career. So he doesn't have to watch his kid bc of his work, but you're supposed to prioritize his kid over your work? Please consider a new bf, bc the flags are redder than a Soviet parade. \n\n3.  Again please reconsider this relationship, the mom doesn't want you to watch her son,  your BF doesn't back you or respect your style of \"parenting\" or babysitting.

Alex is your BF's responsibility and he put you and a difficult situation.  He should not have even asked.  It was HIS time to have with his son, and he needed to take that responsibility.  I get why the ex is upset, but her anger is misplaced.  She should be angry at the father. He needed to communicate this situation to her.  I would be upset if I gave up my time with my child to spend with a person who ended up not even spending time with them.

They have completely unrealistic expectations. If you and your BF have such different parenting views, be happy you found out now, dump him, and find someone you're more compatible with.", "Wtf? You did what you had to do in that moment. It's not your fault the kid was acting like that, if anything it's the exact opposite. Why in the world would his mom blame you for how he's acting?

That said, you did about as well as someone in your position can be expected to do.  \n\nObviously the problem is between your bf and his ex-wife.  You should make clear that the ex-wife should not be contacting you directly for any reason.  If your bf and his ex-wife wanted to raise Alex a certain way, maybe they shouldn\u2019t be leaving Alex alone with you.  Your BF clearly fucked up and he\u2019s the one who should be apologizing to both his ex-wife (for not telling her that he would not be home) and to you (for putting you in the position of having to look after his son while you are working, for having you be yelled at by his ex-wife, and then cowardly asking you to apologize).", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a major asshole, though. He shouldn\u2019t have dumped his kid with you when he didn\u2019t have time for him, and he should have informed the mother. Both he and the child\u2019s mom have no business being mad at you. He fucked up and should be mad at himself, she should be mad at him, too.\n\nUnless they both apologize to you, I would reconsider this relationship.", "NTA. She needs to take it up with her co-parent, not you. You're a girlfriend, not a stepmother, and you were just helping your boyfriend during an unexpected work emergency. You kept the kiddo safe and fed while juggling your own work. You did fine. Don't apologize to his ex. If anything, he owes you an apology for roping you into this and making you deal with his angry ex.", "NTA. After only ONE DAY watching TV for more than one hour, the ex is having problem to have a boundary with her son?Yeah, that is a lie.\n\nNo, you did nothing wrong. You had work to do, a meeting. Boyfriend and ex should be grateful that you accept watching the kid. And if boyfriend is so upset you prioritize your work, why he denied going to work when he was called last minute?", "You are in no way, shape or form TA. You took on a last minute favor for your BF. He has no platform to stand on criticizing you. And do 7 year olds typically trash the kitchen if they can't find their cereal? I don't have kids and my friend's kids that age... don't do stuff like that at all. \n\nNTA", "NTA, unless this child has some developmental issues having a meltdown over not have a cereal, he wanted at his age is not ok.  Did BF just show up at your door with Alex or did he call first and give you a choice.  Big red flag if he just showed up.", "NTA\nWhen someone babysits I am resigned to the fact there is likely to be TV and junk food", "NTA your boyfriend got called to work and expected you to blow off a meeting to watch his kid. Ridiculous", "NTA & it sounds like you handled the situation well.\nDon't apologise. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. Though this would be the last time I babysit for my boyfriend that is for sure!", "As someone three years into a similar situation... \n\nBe careful and think about if you really want to do this. It gets worse. \n\nAlso.. NTA.", "NTA but lose the bf\n\nBf is the dad, he should have prioritized his son rather than work.  He should not be telling you to prioritize his son over your work.\n\nBf\u2019s ex has no right to call you or tell you how to babysit when bf was the one to dump son on you.  Had you volunteered to babysit the boy and she gave explicit instructions, then she would have a leg to stand on.  She was not the one who asked you to babysit so her complaint lies solely with bf, not you.", "This. Different houses have different rules. Children understand this concept easily.", "I totally agree.  He sounds like a 3 year old not 7.", "Nonsense.  My step child absolutely would never have tipped someone's kitchen cupboards out like that because she has manners and she knew how to behave.", "And honestly, even if BF and ex- have a rule about screen time. That's awesome.\n\nBut when you drop your kid off with someone and go- \"watch my kid.\" I can't, I have work. \"Watch my kid.\" I won't be able to entertain them but if they can hangout quietly okay.\n\nYou can't be upset if your child gets too much screen time in that situation. If your kid starts to act in a way that interferes with work, they're going to get put in front of a tv.\n\nOP's job that day wasn't childcare. It was her actual paying job. She was helping out.\n\nShe wasn't parenting. She was babysitting. For free. Presumably because BF didn't want to bring the kid back to his Ex-.", "He is seven cut the child some slack.", "Yes, preciously", "Yeah my main issue is that BF not only shoved the kid onto OP, he also didn't tell her the expectations that should be told to any caregiver taking care of the kid and then proceeded to throw her under the bus to his ex for not meeting those expectations."]}
