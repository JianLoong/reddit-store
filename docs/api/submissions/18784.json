My boyfriend and his ex have split custody of Alex, and I see him occasionally when I visit my boyfriend. \r  \n\r  \nLast week, it was my boyfriend's turn to have Alex, but he was called into work for an emergency. He then dropped off Alex at my place and asked me to look after him that day. I work from home but I had an important meeting, so I told him that I couldn't watch Alex the entire day, but I didn't mind if he entertained himself in another room while I was in the meeting. \r  \n\r  \nIn the morning, I left Alex with a coloring book and pencils in another room while I joined my meeting. However, during the meeting, I suddenly heard Alex crying, so I stepped out to see what was going on. To my surprise, I found that he had opened all the kitchen cabinets and made a mess throwing food everywhere, searching for his favorite dinosaur cereal. When I checked, I realised we were out of that cereal. Alex, who was aware of where I kept the cereal, became extremely upset and started crying and screaming.\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked as I had never seen Alex behave that way and tried to offer him a different cereal, but he continued crying even harder. With my meeting going on, I sternly told Alex to stop crying and gave him two options: eat the cereal I provided or have his lunch early if he was really hungry. Alex didn't choose either option but stopped crying after I scolded him and gave him the TV remote, so I returned to my meeting. \r  \n\r  \nWhen the meeting ended, I found Alex still watching TV and appearing much calmer than before. We had lunch together, and I assumed he was upset earlier due to hunger. I then had him help me clean up the mess he made in the kitchen. Eventually, my boyfriend arrived to pick up Alex and drop him off at his mom's place. I told him about Aex's screen time and he told me not to worry.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday, Alex's mom called me and she blew up on me, accusing me of child neglect. Apparently, Alex had told her about what happened during the day I looked after him, and she was furious that I left him crying to attend a meeting and scolded him. She also expressed surprise that I had taken care of Alex that day, as my boyfriend hadn't told her, and she said he knew I wasn't allowed to be responsible for their son. She claimed that I undermined her parenting style by saying letting him watch TV for more than an hour, and now she struggles to enforce that boundary at home. I ended up hanging up on her and shared the incident with my boyfriend. However, he is taking her side, insisting that I should have prioritized Alex's emotional needs over my meeting and demanding that I apologize to her, given that she is currently not speaking to me. I genuinely don't think I am in the wrong here, I looked after Alex as a favour and did the best I could around my work day, but I just want an unbiased opinion to see if I am TA.", "created_utc": 1685711107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yc8km/aita_for_parenting_my_boyfriends_son/", "score": 443, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can\u2019t seem to make up their minds about what the actual issue is: they firstly accuse you of stepping in to parent the child they forcibly left in your care, then they are angry that you reprimanded him for behaviour that was out of line and juvenile for a seven year old. That behaviour is more like how a toddler would act. You aren\u2019t his parent or his babysitter and they never should have left him in your care once they knew you had to prioritise your job. If I were you I would have a serious talk with your partner about this. It\u2019s not your job to mind his child and to have him throw it in your face when you don\u2019t parent him the way he does is wrong. Also, ganging up on you with his ex-wife is problematic.", ">he is taking her side, insisting that I should have prioritized Alex's emotional needs over my meeting and demanding that I apologize to her\n\nWOW, NTA. If he is so prioritizing his son, he should stay with him instead of work. He thinks his work is more important than yours and his ex is more important than you. I would take it as RED FLAG and reconsider relationship.", "NTA.\n\n> as my boyfriend hadn't told her, and she said he knew I wasn't allowed to be responsible for their son\n\nIf they have split custody of Alex, it means Dad is fully capable of making arrangements for childcare. But even if this isn't the case, it's something she should take with him, not you. \n\nYou were up front and honest about limitations as a babysitter. You straight up told him what was supposed to happen during your meeting, and now he's shocked that's what happened?\n\nNo, sounds like he tried to keep it secret from his ex and now that she found out, he's just using the opportunity to scapegoat you.", "NTA - \"neglect\" is dramatic, to say the very least. your boyfriend knew you had work and he knew that his kid wouldn't get round the clock attention. if he has that much of an issue, he should have taken the day off work to look after his kid.", "Yikes. NTA. If your boyfriend wasn\u2019t comfortable with \u201cAlex entertaining himself in the other room\u201d during your meeting, then he should\u2019ve made other arrangements.", "WHAT.\n\nYou were forced to babysit even though you had to work, and I'm guessing for free, and you get told off for making it through without damage to the kid? (just your kitchen)\n\nAre people really walking this earth so entitled and angry? I don't mean to be rude but this almost sounds made up.\n\nIf not, NTA", "He's 7, not 2. When he's under his father's care, his father is allowed to have someone else watch the kid if he can't. He doesn't need full undivided attention at that age. Honestly, you shouldn't even need her number. Have her text your boyfriend and she can scream at him, and he can document outburst for future reference. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe is old enough he shouldn't be throwing a fit just because he can't have his preferred cereal. You took him as a favour and made your boyfriend aware you had a meeting. \n\nThis is on him, not you.", "NTA, I would break up with the boyfriend too. Dating a parent is hard, it's even harder when the other parent is giving you a hard time. \n\nYou don't want those issues.", "Block her calls. She can deal with your boyfriend, her actual co-parent.", "Um. Consider finding a new boyfriend.", "NTA it sounds like you did a great job under the circumstances. The mother owes you an apology and so does your boyfriend.", "NTA. He should have taken the day off. Not expect you to forego a meeting. He's the parent here. The fact that he so blatantly demands you put his son above your work and income is rather entitled.", "You were thrust in the role of a babysitter and every babysitter I know would have had a cow about what Alex did, and his timing was atrocious (as is often the case with WFH and children ;) )\n\nI agree with others - this is a BF issue. Don't take calls from ex any longer.", "NTA. Kids learn very quickly that there are different rules for behavior with different people and at different places. You just showed Alex a reasonable way to deal with his hunger and frustration. If his mother has problems with his behavior, it's a result of her 7 years with him, and not your single afternoon.\n\n\n\nAlso, you may want to reconsider the boyfriend, who feels entitled to drop off his child for you to babysit, without warning, and expect you to drop your business (why is his work more important than yours?) to entertain his child.", "NTA\n\nThis is why there is a stigma around single parents. Nobody wants to take the burden of another's child.", "NTA, I think you handled the situation really well. It sounds like his mother spoils him a lot and then we he doesnt get what he wants, he throws a tantrum. \n\nOnly thing is that your boyfriend probably should have discussed with his mother that he's leaving him with you for a while.", "NTA. If it was so important that their craptastic parenting style be followed, they should have am emergency person on hand to parent in their style. Otherwise, by leaving the child in your care unannounced, they accept your style.\n\nIt sounds like the mother is a control-freak. It sounds like the poor kid lacks structure and discipline. It sounds like a nightmare situation to be getting involved in. And, if the bf doesn't back you up, what kind of bf is he?", "NTA.  you were caught in the middle of an impossible situation and handled it best you could.  Neglect is way too harsh a word, you behaved appropriately.  Even if the scolding wasnt okay in his or her eyes, they put you in that situation.", "NTA. You did your bf a huge favor unexpectedly on a work day.\n\nYour job is your priority during work hours and if they ask again, the answer is no.\n\nETA your business ingratitude is a problem here", "NTA, but your boyfriend sure is!", "NTA. He\u2019s their kid. The mom accused you of prioritizing your work over her son. You did. With good reason. And it seems like that\u2019s exactly what she and the kid\u2019s father did as well! So why would she judge you for that? Also, did you know you\u2019re not allowed to watch the kid? I mean if she wants to be angry she should be angry at the father for ditching him and not telling her.", "NTA. Run. Far away and quickly. You\u2019ve done your boyfriend a last minute favour and it\u2019s been spat back in your face. I personally wouldn\u2019t be allowing this to happen again so the next time BF has last minute childcare issues you send him straight back to his ex. But it would also be wise to consider making him your ex while you\u2019re at it. Ungrateful chap that he is.", "This is what you should do: Promise them both this will never happen again since you will never, under any circumstance, ever babysit this brat again. NTA.", "NTA, you did your bf a huge favor by watching his son even though he knew you had to work. I'm sure Jr probably embellished some key elements of his day with you and minimized his role in trashing your kitchen to his mother. If you stay in this relationship, I would have a sit down with my bf and set some very clear boundaries about his son and his ex. You aren't the ringmaster of that circus.", "NTA how is someone gonna demand you make their child priority after asking you for a favor? You don't have children and nor do you speak to the mother about screen times etc. Also they just skip over the fact that he tossed out all of this food in your kitchen and you were trying to attend a work meeting you know for the job that helps pay your bills. if they don't like it dont ask you to help out anymore or just end the relationship", "NTA \nA 7 year old should be able to entertain themselves in the next room while in a work meeting.\nBf didn\u2019t have an issue until ex made it an issue.\nHonestly I would refuse to look after him again.", "NTA - the mom probably didn\u2019t get the real story from an upset 7 year old.\n\nThe real AH is your boyfriend:\n1. He should\u2019ve told mom where Alex was that day. I\u2019m sure that added to her anger. \n\n2. He\u2019s throwing you under the bus. I don\u2019t believe his ex knows exactly how everything happened.\n\n3. He knew you had work and expected you to drop everything to watch his son?", "Nta your boyfriend sounds like a walking red flag", "This is breakup worthy. NTA", "What 7 year old blows up about something like that? Is he neurodivergent? If not, he sounds like a spoiled little shit", "NTA. Although it's not really your place to parent him, you had to do that. \"Neglect\" is very dramatic.", "Your parenting skills are terrible, yet its not your child and you didnt ask for... so NTA.", "Bf is the ah. But you never let a seven years old unsupervised. And he was crying and made a mess because he needed the adult... And you scolded him for your own fail. Mum is right to be angry. But the biggest ah is your bf. Then you. For agreeing to watch a kid when you obv not fit for it. You don't let a kid you don't know alone... You should have put some camera... What if he open the windows and climb over it, or start an electric installation..", "Esh. You are not the mother of that child.

He is not your kid and you took very good care of him while at work (guess your bf forgot that part, huh?), just beucause you are working from home people tend to assume that is not \"real work\" or that you can skip it any time, no true AT ALL. \"Momma bear\" might be taking it out on you her frustrations about her ex and you and your bf should talk about it so you can set YOUR OWN boundaries regarding all of this.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is the problem.  He should be thanking you for stepping in for him during an emergency and apologizing for his son wrecking your kitchen.

Your hopefully Ex boyfriend and his ex are though. Why is his work more important than yours?? Since when is it okay for his ex to call and tell you off and then YOU have to apologize to her?

He's  7 a full-blown screaming tantrum, and destruction of your kitchen over cereal is slightly unexpected and would warrant being scolded. \n\n2.  Did your BF just expect to dump HIS kid on you, and you take off work? This man doesn't have much respect for you or your career. So he doesn't have to watch his kid bc of his work, but you're supposed to prioritize his kid over your work? Please consider a new bf, bc the flags are redder than a Soviet parade. \n\n3.  Again please reconsider this relationship, the mom doesn't want you to watch her son,  your BF doesn't back you or respect your style of \"parenting\" or babysitting.

Alex is your BF's responsibility and he put you and a difficult situation.  He should not have even asked.  It was HIS time to have with his son, and he needed to take that responsibility.  I get why the ex is upset, but her anger is misplaced.  She should be angry at the father. He needed to communicate this situation to her.  I would be upset if I gave up my time with my child to spend with a person who ended up not even spending time with them.

They have completely unrealistic expectations. If you and your BF have such different parenting views, be happy you found out now, dump him, and find someone you're more compatible with.", "Wtf? You did what you had to do in that moment. It's not your fault the kid was acting like that, if anything it's the exact opposite. Why in the world would his mom blame you for how he's acting?

Work meetings are important. Additionally they're probably required for you to keep your job and you excused yourself to handle the situation. Which is going further than most would.\n\nThe reality here is that you agreed to take care of the child, which also means trying to understand the child and how to work with them. Which you did mostly, and any constraints of how child care is meant to be for that child should have been communicated by the parents. End of the day, you provided assistance for both of them and they're being AH ish about it.\n\nThe reason I say ish is because it seems that ex has issues with her ex, your boyfriend, either dating someone else or having someone else in the child's life. When they phoned it would have been a good time to de escalate the situation with them and talk openly, because if you want to keep your partner in your life then there is a very high chance you will have a parental role to play to one degree or another. I think this is where part of the exes issues stem from.\n\nYour partner should have either told his ex you were taking care of the child, or made it clear that it's not a restriction that can be fairly imposed to his ex. On the undermining their boundaries ect, no, not unless you were told explicitly that they're not allowed tv during the day ect....

If the babysitting was something that I agreed to prior then I would keep my day free so I could watch the kid completely. Otherwise hell no, here\u2019s some candy and TV, enjoy until I\u2019m free.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m gonna add this just for clarification, if I could cancel my plans, I would but if I have an important meeting at work, no this is my future vs a kid that isn\u2019t even mine. I\u2019d prefer losing the relationship than my job.", "Not OP", "NTA... Here ends any babysitting.  He dropped him off when he knew it was inconvenient and then  he is stupid enough to criticize you?! He showed that his parenting skills are the ones lacking.\n\nYour boyfriend is the AH. His ex is frankly irrelevant to this situation.", "NTA you were at work. Just hard no watching Alex in the future. Father has to be present.", "NTA. You did the best you could with circumstances your boyfriend knew about. You ket the child alive, fed and relatively calm. If the ex doesn't like it, then she needs to take that up with your bf and be the one to take care of the child next time.", "NTA but please think hard about your future with this man. He 1) dumped his kid on you after you told him no; 2) sided with his unhinged ex who was being ridiculous; and 3) made clear that he expects you to prioritize his kid over your job. Any one of these is bad. The 3 together suggest you\u2019re going to have an unpleasant life if you stay with him.", "Red flags! Red flags everywhere! Run for the hills! This is bullshit.", "Time for a new boyfriend. NTA", "You should have prioritized Alex over your work meeting.......just like his father did, right?\n\nWhy didn't your boyfriend either not go to work (even though it was an emergency) or take his child back to the mother? Why did he have you take care of the child if you aren't supposed to?  Your SO owes you an apology and you should never babysit for him again.", "NTA. You were asked to babysit during your work day.  You did what a lot of babysitters would do in that situation. You did nothing wrong. Lots of red flagsare waving regarding your BF. Rethink this relationship.", "NTA.  You BF doesn't respect you.  If he did, he would have: (1) thanked you profusely for helping him solve HIS problem, (2) he would have told his ex he used you in an emergency because he would communicate to/with her about emergencies, (3) he would have told ex to NEVER call you about problems with his child, and (4) he would have taken your side where he belonged.  Rather, he expected you to give up you work to care for his kid while he works is beyond crazy--and be responsible for dealing with his ex.  If you stay with him you would be a a\\*\\*hole.  He is not on your side, and he doesn't belong with you.", "NTA. Run. They are immature. Also send them a bill for babysitting.", "The kid is confused and needs full time parenting. If you all can't work together with this, then the kid is going to have issues. The children are the most important thing we have. Work with that thought in mind, as a priority. He didn't need that brand of cereal,  he needed an understanding parent who is capable of identifying his real needs.", "Sounds like the poor kid had an anxiety attack. I'm so sorry for him feeling hungry and lost and distressed being dumped in a strange environment with a relative stranger who's now left him to it (how long was he alone to have started crying?)\n\nYou are absolutely NTA - his parents are. But damn - that poor kid. 7yo is still so little.", "Maybe he should have stayed home from his work emergency to watch his son. Apparently you can\u2019t work and must drop everything to take care of his son. He left you working and to look after his son, of course you are going to use screen time. Kids need to be scolded when they do something wrong, unless you want entitled children. NTA", "> Can't imagine the person who does that to a child\n\nThe only thing she did to the child was leave him in front of the TV for some time. I don't see what's so terrible about that.", "People also need to stop acting like TV gives children cancer. I don't know what is up with new parents these days who are so obsessed about limiting screen time. I swear some of them are more uptight about TV than if their kids were given a pack of cigarettes.", "NTA - he dumped his child on you without warning and without any regard to your own priorities.  Then he bitches that you didn't drop your job to cater to his kid who acted atrociously.  He should be apologizing to you.  Honestly I would not want to be in a relationship with someone who cared so little about me.", "NTA are you gonna marry this guy and deal with this for the rest of your life? If not, I'd cut my losses and get out.", "NTA\nThis is a case of a jealous ex who is using what little authority she has to influence what happens with her kids dad and cause drama.\nIf it is the dad's time, he can choose to leave the child with whatever responsible adult he chooses.\nI agree you did the best you could and handled a difficult situation admirably.\nThis is a tough position to be in for you, and will likely continue to be so until the child is too old for mom to use this as an excuse to influence and start drama.\nMy advice is to leave it to your bf to run interference. Don't speak with this woman. She's unhinged.\nBe a friend and helper with the kid when you have the opportunity.  It will be a blessing for him.", "NTA. You told him in advance that you have a meeting, and he said it was fine. You told him when he got home everything that happened, and he said it was fine. She throws a fit, and now it's a problem? Let him know that you will not be babysitting when he is unavailable for his days, and he will need to provide the mom with his schedule so they can make sure they have coverage for their son. Working from home does not mean you can play daycare for them just so she can yell at you.", "The bf is ridiculous. \n\nYou should prioritize my son over your work\n\nAs he drops him off and jets off to work when it was his day to be with him. \n\nThe hypocrisy is real.", "NTA. He dropped him off without asking before hand and gave no instructions. Also acted like everything was fine when he picked him up even though you told him he had watched tv for a while. So now he is an AH because his ex is an AH.   You are not responsible for him getting called into work. Let him take care of his own kid", "NTA. This man left his child with you for work \u201cemergency\u201d but expected you to neglect your job for HIS RESPONSIBILITY/CHILD? Did I get the gist of this correct? \n\nAwww hell naw. \n\nNow should a 7yo child be left alone in a strange home to entertain themselves indefinitely? Absolutely not. Also did Dad ever talk about when the child last ate or drank anything? Ugh. Parenting 101. Come on ppl. \n\nYour post doesn\u2019t mention your age, whether you\u2019ve had kids or even have experience around children. It\u2019s relative to the discussion as these individuals may have asked more of you than you were potentially prepared for or even capable of (and I truly mean no offense). Couple all this with the fact that you were \u201cthrown to the wolves\u201d in this situation so to speak. \nAny apology should be directed to the child alone and might contain the following \u201cI am so sorry that we had a hard time when we were together. I hope that we can still be \u201cfriends\u201d (remember you\u2019re talking to a kid) and if I hurt your feelings that you will forgive me.\u201d  Done. DONE.  Nothing more is necessary.", "unfortunately, its prevalent.\n\nI think its across all generations, not a specific group, just a byproduct of tolerating bad behavior so you don't hurt someones feelings.", ">she was responsible for a 7 year old all day and failed\n\nThe 7 year old survived the day with no serious injuries or psychological trauma (being out of your usual cereal and getting too much screen time are NOT traumatic). That is literally ALL an emergency babysitter needs to ensure. Sure, if she agreed to be his regular caregiver and was leaving him to his own devices every day, that would be one thing, but that's not the case here. The kid will be fine."]}
