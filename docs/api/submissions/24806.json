I have a 5 year old border collie something mix, Molly who I got from the city shelter when she was 6 months old. Molly and I have been inseparable and my bf and her got along great when we started dating. I thought he saw Molly as his dog even though I paid for everything regarding Molly\u2019s food, vet bills etc. \n\nLast year my bf lost his job for 4 months and I paid for everything until he got another job. It was probably an extra 5000 but I paid it because I expected him to do the same for me if I got sick or laid off. I never asked for it paid back or mentioned it again and he said anything but thanks when I said I would do it.\n\nA few months ago Molly was having trouble walking and developed a tumor on her hind leg and it was making her limp. I was worried and took her to the vet who did a biopsy and said it was not cancerous but they did several biopsys because they were not sure. All the biopsys, blood tests, overnight stays, meds and surgery cost around $5300 and I had some savings and could cover it but that would be my entire emergency fund. My bf had a few thousand extra because he was saving for a motorcycle and I told him I had trouble paying Molly\u2019s vet bill. He didn\u2019t say anything but that sucks and proceeded to buy his motorcycle - week later. I was so angry because I had helped him but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to help Molly when it came down to it. I did have to empty my entire savings for Molly\u2019s vet bills and have less than a grand in savings. \n\nThe lease is only under my bf\u2019s name and I gave him a month\u2019s notice (I physically moved out 2 days later to a friends place) I was leaving and he should find a roommate if he wanted to split the cost with someone. He was shocked and said I had completely blindsided him. I told him the reason and he argued I said I had trouble paying the vet bills but didn\u2019t tell him I expect him to help. \n\nI pointed out I had helped when he was out of work and he argued he thought the money from that was a gift because he never agreed to pay it back so I shouldn\u2019t expect help in exchange. I argued he acted like Molly was his dog and he argued I was paying for everything regarding her so he didn\u2019t expect me to ask him for anything. He told everyone we were mutual friends with I had blindsided him and left him with out a good reason. I told some of these friends why I left and most took my side but some of the guys and girls told me it was because guys are extremely bad at communicating and I should have directly asked for money and just mentioning I had trouble paying the bill means my bf wouldn\u2019t have gotten it. I don\u2019t buy that my bf was stupid enough to not get the indirect ask and even if he didn\u2019t I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t offer out of principle if he loves Molly.

The excuse about men being bad at communicating (while true), is bullshit because it should be about compassion", "NTA. Yes, you should have told him directly but the bottom line is when he was in need, you helped him out and when you were in need, he bought a motorcycle.

He does not have your back like you have his.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH.\n\nHe does not sound very appreciative of you helping out during his unemployment and seems disprespectful in general.\n\nBut hints are not an effective way to communicate. If you need help, ask. Maybe it\u2019s obvious to you but believe it or not people are not mind readers and this is NOT just a weakness guys have. You didn\u2019t communicate before you decided to move out even when there was a whole week in between your hint and him getting the bike. Why didn\u2019t you confront him at all during that time?

He didn\u2019t think to offer and focused on buying his motorcycle. You broke up, you don\u2019t have to justify it.

You directly told him you were struggling and he said, that too bad, and proceeds to buy himself a big exspensive toy...\n\nBreak up.", "NTA. He didn't seem to care about helping out with any responsibilities in terms of splitting costs of living and dog expenses, instead only caring about what benefited him.", "You\u2019re not an AH, but you need to learn to communicate your needs, wants, and expectations.

You simply mentioned it to him and expected him to break this pattern.\n\nI don't think either of you are 'arseholes' but I can definitely see a world where this is resolved in a better way if you were more upfront about his contributions to the vet costs, and/or if he were more attentive to the situation at hand", "NTA\n\nBe thankful you dodged a bullet.\n\nSo you help him out when he needs it but it doesnt occur to offer to help you when you need help.\n\nHe cant be that oblivious.\n\nNow you are out $5K but if it cost that much to learn who your bf really is,.it is a bargain.", "YTA.\n\n\"I dropped a hint\" is the most idiotic way of communicating.\n\nIf you are in a partnership with someone you should be grown up enough to have an adult conversation.  Dropping hints is for teenagers flirting in high school.", "ESH. \nYou could have been direct with him. While he didn\u2019t have to be direct with you, because you immediately recognized the need, not everyone thinks the same way. My fianc\u00e9e has ADHD AND doesn\u2019t pick up on hints very easily, so I am always direct with him if I want or need something. \n\nHE should have said \u201cOh sorry, my bad\u201d and sucked it up when you finally were direct with him. It would have shown it was just thoughtlessness on his part, and lack of communication on yours.

She was hospitalized a few times too. My boyfriend HIMSELF suggested that we use our common money that we had been saving up together to cover for the vet bill, no questions asked, because he knew that if it came down to it, I'd do the same for his cat as well. He treated my cat like his own, and never made me feel like he would never help with her treatment. By the end she required constant attention 5 to 7 times a day for various treatments and medications and he helped me do it without complaining.\n\nNTA.\n\nI hope that you ran from this person and never looked back.", "personally, i think you\u2019re NTA. i think you should\u2019ve been more direct. hints get people nowhere sometimes. i can be dense as hell even when i think i\u2019m good at picking up cues. whenever you get into another relationship, prioritize refining your communication skills. whether it is direct conversation or understanding each other\u2019s habits and love language.\n\nanyway, you gave him a month\u2019s notice and he was deadweight. you didnt blindside him he just didn\u2019t think you were serious. you deserve better. i hope Molly is doing well.", "NTA. He chose to buy a motorcycle instead of helping you with the vet bills. You are better off without him.", "NTA you said you were having trouble and he didn't care.

We have had this issue with our fur ball eating tennis balls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were together for a year at this point, or less. The other half did have the money but it was a loan money which he would have to pay interest. I had the cash in a separate account for emergencies.

He never asked for the money but the furball was mine when he used to work away.\n\nHe tried to pay it back, but I said no need, we just need to save money to build emergency reserve for emergency fur-bills.

You and Molly came in as a package deal and if he assumes you paying for everything when he was out of work was a \"gift\" and he shouldn't be expected to chip in when you're in need, then he's not ready for a relationship.", "NTA - you can leave, any time, for any reason.", "NTA. Good riddance to a trash human being.", "NTA", "NTA. I might have said you should have directly asked if it wasn\u2019t for his reaction of still not offering to help you out after you told him.

Some people need direct communication rather than hints but honestly, if the person you\u2019re with doesn\u2019t see your stress and want to help, especially after you helped them, they\u2019re probably not the right one for you.

However, honestly? You've done him a favour by breaking up with him, since its clear you'll \"punish\" your SO if they don't read your mind and cater to your whims without it being said. \n\nGrow up and stop playing those childish games and learn to communicate clearly if you need help.

It is not about doing something for someone else or helping when not asked.  I do nothing but help the people around me without being asked.  The problem is he didn't fully or clearly understand the situation.  He didn't understand what tight meant and likely didn't even k ow how serious the conversation was.  Hell did he even know how much the vet bill was?  I assume so, but it was not very clear.  Also it she had plenty of cash to support him for 4 months why would he all of a sudden think she didn't have cash for a vet bill.  The problem is not caring or not, it is communication and being clear with what the issue and needs are.  If those things aren't clear that who would know she needed or wanted help?", "Lol", "Because she isn't", "This is called a \"covert contract.\"  It's a contract that you made up in your head that he didn't know about.  It's a bad habit that leads to resentment and frustration.", "You don't know that it's clear he wouldn't help you, because you didn't ask him for help", "Not everyone\u2019s mind works the same. People don\u2019t automatically follow the same thought pattern as you do, so it\u2019s incredibly unfair to be mad at someone just because they don\u2019t think exactly as you. \n\nHe might have been perfectly fine with helping *if you had asked*!", "I agree. You\u2019re better without him. That being said, people like you are rare and it\u2019s not entirely reasonable to expect someone to always immediatley pick up on your hints. Going forward I recommend just asking. It\u2019s not less generous if they have to be asked first. They can still say yes or no either way and misinterpretation is a thing", "That\u2019s great. But you\u2019re not a giver you are a trader. And your bf is a taker. Not saying you should be with a taker, or that being a trader is bad. But if you are going to be a trader you need to use your words because you, the trader, are going to get turned into a giver by takers over and over.", "But you're generosity comes with a price tag, which makes it disingenuous", "Sounds like your boyfriend dodged a bullet there, good for him. Oh and yta, learn how to communicate", "Sorry but YTA, no man is like that, or woman. It's called talking, people can't read minds.", "So you didn't think it was expected of you but you did expect it from him? Seems like separating was the best option.", "It isn't clear what he thinks because you never asked him", "Timing aside, you're both better off without one another.", "You didn\u2019t think you were expected but did so anyway.\n\nBut now you expect him to? That sounds awfully hypocritical.", ">I didn\u2019t think it was expected\n\nSo why:\n\n>I guess I\u2019m the only one who is expected to do that.", "*sigh* its like youre deliberately trying to miss the point. Id have an easier time explaining this to my 2 year old. Im off to spend this time communicating clearly with my friends and family, enjoy!", "Its almost like there is stuff we could do to fix these problems, like clear adult communication! But you seem comfy on your martyrs cross so ill just let you hang there. Enjoy!", "Honestly my partner was like that. I had to be clear with communication. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t love me, he just didn\u2019t get hints. Hell my now roommate is even like that.", "Sorry, poor wording on my part. I\u2019m a woman, and I\u2019ve only ever seen women do the \u201cread my mind\u201d thing, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s exclusive to women.\n\nAnd also I think you missed the part where I said the boyfriend is a selfish asshole for buying his motorcycle instead of helping?", "It\u2019s not, but it is the job of an adult (whether male or female) to communicate their needs clearly to their partner.", "It isn\u2019t. Just like it isn\u2019t the man\u2019s job- or anyone\u2019s job- to be a mind reader.", "\u201cDo you need some help?\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s not problem solving. Men are only \u201cutter morons when it comes to this stuff\u201d because you can\u2019t be bothered to get better at it, and it\u2019s just easier to pout and say it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault. \n\nFor the record, \u201cthat sucks\u201d is not offering emotional help.", "It\u2019s fair but I can\u2019t consider a guy who would take my help but not return it husband material. It\u2019s best we part ways before it becomes more serious", "A lot of people also have different bars for what they\u2019re willing to spend on an animals vet bills. It may not have occurred to him she was asking for help because he wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t have spent 5k on an animal, even if he loved it and viewed it as his own (unclear).", "I don\u2019t get it, he knows Molly had bills, he knows I told him what the amount was and it would clear out all the savings. He has thousands extra saved for a motorcycle. He\u2019s in sales, he is very good at human interaction, I know everyone is telling me he just made a mistake but I don\u2019t think so because I know this guy well.", "expecting the same treatment you provide is hardly a price tag", "How is \"no woman like that\" if OP literally was like that?", "Expected is like a bill. You must pay me back etc\n\nSuppose to is like a child to a parent who took care of them. Yes the child doesn\u2019t have to take care of them in their old age but if the parent took care of the child, it\u2019s a respectful thing to do. \n\nOne is a must do the other is a social contract. You have my back I have yours.", "LOL, no need to be a martyr as I'm married to a fully functioning adult human being who is capable of doing the right thing all by himself without me having to tell him. Communication isn't going to fix OP's ex's selfishness.", "Meh, depends who it is. For some people the acknowledgement is giving them emotional support they want.", "Never said what he did was problem solving, I was insinuating he did the exact opposite actually. \n\nYou're just agreeing with everything I said, but in a roundabout way. \n\nI'm not defending the guy. I'm saying he's an utter moron and lacks the ability to mind read, so it needs to be spelled out for him.\n\nFor the record, I personally would've taken the dog to the vet and covered everything without the girl even needing to mention her money problems. But I'm an older fellow who learned how weirdly some women don't communicate. \n\nNo need to get upset with me. I was just providing a perspective that many young men are very often confused by, which hopefully goes away as they get older.", "That's fine and a good idea!", "I was kind of wondering if this wasn't part of it.  Maybe he was shocked at the cost.  I know I am", "I don\u2019t get how you couldn\u2019t just come out and ask him. It isn\u2019t that hard. No one should be expected to infer anything. You have turned this relationship into a transaction. I helped you without being asked so now you owe me.  Except in that case you would have actually used words. But your arguing is basically just you refusing to own any of this issue. That\u2019s a maturity issue on your part. Use your words. Make judgements when everyone is on the same page.", "Have you asked him about it?", "He didn't make a mistake. You're better off without him. But if you can't have mature and adult conversations about money where things are clear to both parties, you're going to continue to run into the same problems. You aren't just going to luck into a relationship where both people think about money the same way through reading each other's minds. If you can't advocate for yourself in a direct way, you will run into this problem again. \n\nAlso he's in sales, means he's good at human interactions to get what he wants. He didn't make a mistake and you're better off without him most likely but you also need to learn from this.", "\ud83d\ude02", "It's not the same. A child can't make an agreement like that. Two adults can reciprocate generosity", "Ohhhhh, so whoever spends money on the other first gets all the say. Got it.", "Asked him about what?"]}
