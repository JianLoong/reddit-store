I have a 5 year old border collie something mix, Molly who I got from the city shelter when she was 6 months old. Molly and I have been inseparable and my bf and her got along great when we started dating. I thought he saw Molly as his dog even though I paid for everything regarding Molly\u2019s food, vet bills etc. \n\nLast year my bf lost his job for 4 months and I paid for everything until he got another job. It was probably an extra 5000 but I paid it because I expected him to do the same for me if I got sick or laid off. I never asked for it paid back or mentioned it again and he said anything but thanks when I said I would do it.\n\nA few months ago Molly was having trouble walking and developed a tumor on her hind leg and it was making her limp. I was worried and took her to the vet who did a biopsy and said it was not cancerous but they did several biopsys because they were not sure. All the biopsys, blood tests, overnight stays, meds and surgery cost around $5300 and I had some savings and could cover it but that would be my entire emergency fund. My bf had a few thousand extra because he was saving for a motorcycle and I told him I had trouble paying Molly\u2019s vet bill. He didn\u2019t say anything but that sucks and proceeded to buy his motorcycle - week later. I was so angry because I had helped him but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to help Molly when it came down to it. I did have to empty my entire savings for Molly\u2019s vet bills and have less than a grand in savings. \n\nThe lease is only under my bf\u2019s name and I gave him a month\u2019s notice (I physically moved out 2 days later to a friends place) I was leaving and he should find a roommate if he wanted to split the cost with someone. He was shocked and said I had completely blindsided him. I told him the reason and he argued I said I had trouble paying the vet bills but didn\u2019t tell him I expect him to help. \n\nI pointed out I had helped when he was out of work and he argued he thought the money from that was a gift because he never agreed to pay it back so I shouldn\u2019t expect help in exchange. I argued he acted like Molly was his dog and he argued I was paying for everything regarding her so he didn\u2019t expect me to ask him for anything. He told everyone we were mutual friends with I had blindsided him and left him with out a good reason. I told some of these friends why I left and most took my side but some of the guys and girls told me it was because guys are extremely bad at communicating and I should have directly asked for money and just mentioning I had trouble paying the bill means my bf wouldn\u2019t have gotten it. I don\u2019t buy that my bf was stupid enough to not get the indirect ask and even if he didn\u2019t I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t offer out of principle if he loves Molly.

The excuse about men being bad at communicating (while true), is bullshit because it should be about compassion", "NTA. Yes, you should have told him directly but the bottom line is when he was in need, you helped him out and when you were in need, he bought a motorcycle.

He does not have your back like you have his.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH.\n\nHe does not sound very appreciative of you helping out during his unemployment and seems disprespectful in general.\n\nBut hints are not an effective way to communicate. If you need help, ask. Maybe it\u2019s obvious to you but believe it or not people are not mind readers and this is NOT just a weakness guys have. You didn\u2019t communicate before you decided to move out even when there was a whole week in between your hint and him getting the bike. Why didn\u2019t you confront him at all during that time?

He didn\u2019t think to offer and focused on buying his motorcycle. You broke up, you don\u2019t have to justify it.

You directly told him you were struggling and he said, that too bad, and proceeds to buy himself a big exspensive toy...\n\nBreak up.", "NTA. He didn't seem to care about helping out with any responsibilities in terms of splitting costs of living and dog expenses, instead only caring about what benefited him.", "You\u2019re not an AH, but you need to learn to communicate your needs, wants, and expectations.

Dropping hints is for teenagers flirting in high school.", "ESH. \nYou could have been direct with him. While he didn\u2019t have to be direct with you, because you immediately recognized the need, not everyone thinks the same way. My fianc\u00e9e has ADHD AND doesn\u2019t pick up on hints very easily, so I am always direct with him if I want or need something. \n\nHE should have said \u201cOh sorry, my bad\u201d and sucked it up when you finally were direct with him. It would have shown it was just thoughtlessness on his part, and lack of communication on yours.

She was hospitalized a few times too. My boyfriend HIMSELF suggested that we use our common money that we had been saving up together to cover for the vet bill, no questions asked, because he knew that if it came down to it, I'd do the same for his cat as well. He treated my cat like his own, and never made me feel like he would never help with her treatment. By the end she required constant attention 5 to 7 times a day for various treatments and medications and he helped me do it without complaining.\n\nNTA.\n\nI hope that you ran from this person and never looked back.", "personally, i think you\u2019re NTA. i think you should\u2019ve been more direct. hints get people nowhere sometimes. i can be dense as hell even when i think i\u2019m good at picking up cues. whenever you get into another relationship, prioritize refining your communication skills. whether it is direct conversation or understanding each other\u2019s habits and love language.\n\nanyway, you gave him a month\u2019s notice and he was deadweight. you didnt blindside him he just didn\u2019t think you were serious. you deserve better. i hope Molly is doing well.", "NTA.

We have had this issue with our fur ball eating tennis balls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were together for a year at this point, or less. The other half did have the money but it was a loan money which he would have to pay interest. I had the cash in a separate account for emergencies.

He never asked for the money but the furball was mine when he used to work away.\n\nHe tried to pay it back, but I said no need, we just need to save money to build emergency reserve for emergency fur-bills.

You and Molly came in as a package deal and if he assumes you paying for everything when he was out of work was a \"gift\" and he shouldn't be expected to chip in when you're in need, then he's not ready for a relationship.", "NTA - you can leave, any time, for any reason.", "NTA. Good riddance to a trash human being.", "NTA", "NTA. I might have said you should have directly asked if it wasn\u2019t for his reaction of still not offering to help you out after you told him.

Some people need direct communication rather than hints but honestly, if the person you\u2019re with doesn\u2019t see your stress and want to help, especially after you helped them, they\u2019re probably not the right one for you.

You've done him a favour by breaking up with him, since its clear you'll \"punish\" your SO if they don't read your mind and cater to your whims without it being said. \n\nGrow up and stop playing those childish games and learn to communicate clearly if you need help.

It is only reasonable to expect a serious partner to support you in a time of need if they can, without having to spell it out or make it all about quid pro quos. Not only does he not care about helping OP, he also lacks the basic instinct for reciprocity, since OP supported him for almost the exact dollar amount she now needs help with.\n\nSo I wouldn't really characterise this as a \"hint\" (even though OP has), but rather just a somewhat fortuitous test that has revealed that this partner is not worth wasting any more time on.

You and the commenter you responded to are in agreement on that. So am I, because like you said, the BF showed he cares less about her needs than he should, especially after she showed how much she cares about him. It's a lopsided relationship.\n\nBut it can also be true that giving hints is a worse way to communicate than simply asking for what you need, or what you're owed.
