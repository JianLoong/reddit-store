Are they mad?", "Have you texted or spoke to your parents, letting them know they'll be getting an air mattress in the basement? I don't see anywhere in your post that anyone is upset about anything, at least not yet. Talk to them. If they're not upset about it, then there's no problem.", "Just explain your plans so they can make a decision. It would be rude to just throw this at them. They can choose to come or not", "NTA. You are right. Where exactly did they think they were going to sleep? At least they'll be staying in a finished basement. When you say air mattress, do you mean like a camping one or do you mean more like those air mattress beds? The latter would be a good investment since it can be deflated & using in case of emergencies. Or unexpected guests :)", "NTA\nIf they made plans to stay knowing there is no guest room then they know what they\u2019re in for.", "NTA. If they don't want to sleep on an air mattress in the basement then they should stay at the hotel and deal with the travel time. Or camp outside.\n\nOr they can just deal with sleeping on an air mattress in the basement for one night. Beggars can't be choosers.", "INFO: If you have a finished basement, with sufficient space for a mattress on the floor, why can't there be a bed frame down there, with a mattress on it? Or, failing that, at least a fold-out couch? \n\nAlso, OP, have you not noticed that the older people get, the harder it generally is for them to get down onto, and back up off of, the floor? That may or may not be an issue for your parents now, but it definitely will be one in time. Since you say that there are no nearby hotels, you should probably think about how you want to handle future visits \u2013 starting with, do you even want your parents to visit you? Because if you do, it sounds like you're going to need to be able to let them stay with you. And the older they get, the harder it will be for them to sleep on the floor.\n\nNow, if you want them *not* to visit you, then keep doing what you're doing, and sooner or later, your home will become so unwelcoming to them that they'll stop. (The whole \"this is the best I'm really willing to do\" leads me to suspect this may be the goal.)", "Amazon sells a foldable bed frame that is very compact. You can put it up in less than 2 min. \n\n\nBut make sure they know they\u2019ll be sleeping on an air mattress on the floor.

Super comfy", "NTA\n\nBut do communicate this with them. They will most probably be understanding and fine with it. But knowing this after they're at your place might make the situation unpleasant.", "NTA, I guess... \n\nBUT I'm always thinking about my parents age, my in laws, uncles, aunts, etc... So I would never do that. I would offer my bed and I would sleep in the air mattress.For example, if I'm not driving and someone that is older is with me I always let them have the front passenger seat, because is more comfortable. \n\nYou and your husband are really young, one night on the air mattress is nothing. For your parents one night is rough. The bones and muscles are really not the same, maybe you will understand in a few years...", "Where I am from, it would be unacceptable not to give up your own bedroom for parents. So YTA imo, but if you're Americans you're probably fine lol", "Why can't you move the now-floor bed mattress to the living room when it's bedtime and let them sleep on that? You may not have a bed frame but still have a more comfortable option than airbed and basement. Or tell them just to not come as you don't have time to make proper arrangements for the night. The last sentence was basically \"I can't be arsed\" so while I know unexpected grandparent visits may be annoying, and it's only one night, kinda YTA for the attitude you have to it.", "What about the mattress in the play room, couldn't you have used that? Or does your child use that?", "NTA, tbh.  When my in-laws are in town, we usually give them the bedroom and we take the foldout, just out of courtesy (and because they're old), but that's not mandatory.", "I feel like I'm missing out on some information here. Where is the conflict? (Are you asking if you *WBTAH*?) \n\nI live quite a ways from my mother and I have to say that, considering careers + distance,  4x/year at 2-3 days each is fairly frequent, IMO. \n\nYour mom gave you props for the work you did. Did you explain at the time that the playroom is replacing the guest room? Do you not want your parents to visit? A one-month heads up from your parents about an overnight visit, when they seem to be welcome otherwise, doesn't seem like they are \"springing\" anything on you. \n\nYWBTA if you did not tell them soon that you plan to put them on an air mattress. (IMO, nothing wrong w finished basements or air mattresses in principle, but you need to consider the needs of your guests.) While I wouldn't offer my room bed to all guests, I would personally offer my room to my mother/parents in such scenarios.", "NTA. From experience, I know that a good air mattress makes a perfectly acceptable bed.", "I personally would not have my parents sleep on an air mattress. I would give them my bed. They are not random guests. They are your parents.", "YTA for your overall attitude. Why can they not sleep on the floor mattress? Also, if my parents were staying over for just a night I\u2019d give them my bed and sleep on the floor mattress or air mattress myself.", "NTA. Though they\u2019ll probably pressure you into letting them use your bed!", "NAH leaning YTA - The expectation in my family and my culture is that you give the older person the best bed out of respect. I would give my parents my bed and sleep on the air mattress but its different if you need to be closer to your toddler. I'd say depends in part if your parents are an old 60 or young 60", "Yta, but for your attitude. The playroom set-up, can\u2019t that accommodate the air-mattress? Tho, setting up the air mattress in a finished basement isn\u2019t a big deal, as long as it\u2019s one of those ones that are elevated and not one that\u2019s literally 2-inches off the floor. Putting a parent on one of those floor air mattresses is just\u2026rude.", "NAH\n\nObviously the most polite thing to do would be to offer them your bed and then you and husband sleep on the air mattress, but it\u2019s also ok if you offer them the air mattress.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, don\u2019t be surprised/offended if the 4x a year go down to no times a year. For many people (especially older people) an air mattress on a basement floor isn\u2019t going to work. And that\u2019s fine, they don\u2019t need to stay with you if that\u2019s what you\u2019re offering. But you live in a remote location where suitable alternatives just aren\u2019t available.", "NTA. I felt better about it as soon as you said the basement was finished. I think that is fine for now but you might eventually get an actual bed. As your parents age it might become unsafe for them to get in and out of the air mattress on the floor.", "Why not put bed in the basement?", "YWBTA if you don't let them know ahead of time so they can make other arrangements if an air mattress isn't going to work for them. In the future you could maybe look at a pull-out couch for the basement? I'm sure it would come in handy in the future for sleepovers for your child also.", "Air mattress really have gotten a lot better than in the past.

However, I would consider up grading the air mattress to a futon or hide a bed since this is a finished basement.", "I disagree with this view. Your parents are going to visit you and it's not weird that they would. There is no hotel close by as OP mentioned. They gave a couple of weeks notice which is not springing something on someone and they don't visit that often so its not an unreasonable ask. It's at least a NAH situation. This sub I thinks views social dilemnas in terms of obligations/non-obligations rather than should/should not. You are not obligated to give your parents your bed but its the respectful thing to do.", "Yeah, this sounds like they haven't just said 'hey, the room isn't free anymore, how should we manage the sleeping situation?' and had the most basic conversation.", "Oh yes. Loved the comment about an air mattress is the best daughter is willing to do.\n\nAlso wonder if son in law got the mattress in the camping aisle or the home goods section. Huge difference in quality.", "They make full height air mattresses that take up no space when not in use and are way more comfortable than any fold out couch I have ever slept on. We take one with us when glamping at a music festival because it is much more comfortable than the cots provided. This was also a last minute, surprise- we are coming, trip, and they have a 16 month old, and probably a limited budget. If the parents want a comfy place to sleep, they can invest in a bed for themselves, which over time would be less expensive and closer than a 40 minute away hotel.", "You mean move the mattress the 16 month old in to living room? Where would the baby who lives there then sleep?", "As I implied in the other comment, where would the 16 month old sleep? With the grandparents now taking its bed?", "It depends. I learned once to never give my own bedroom and my bed to anyone visiting because it's my personal safe spot in my house and I don't want anyone except me and my husband there.", "The toddler are on the floor mattress. If my parents dont have a disability or health problems. I wouldn\u2019t give up my bed in my own home. Especially when I didn\u2019t even invite them and they didn\u2019t ask.

At least in a hotel its strangers.I would gladly take the air matress!", "It\u2019s a playroom. Is the child living there?", "And depending on the relationship a person has with the guest, that may be kind of awkward, esp if the person shares that bed with a partner.  It\u2019s a very personal space.", "Well you offer them the choice and if they so they'd prefer the air mattress thats their decision. You just wash the sheets before they visit like you should probably do every once in a while anyway. Growing up in a house of 8 people with like 20-25 extended family members that would visit and visit them I think the sanctity of sleeping in a bed that no ones ever had sex in seems a bit silly. We had to give up our beds for aunts and uncles all the time and unless they were really dumb they knew teenagers did stuff in those beds.", "My mom and stepdad slept in my bed when they visited. Now that my stepdad is gone, my mom takes my bed when she visits, which is about once per year. She knows my fiance and I have sex in the bed.
