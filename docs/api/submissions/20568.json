Some days people just walk around with two brain cells fighting for third place.", "How many bedrooms are in your house? It sounds like three: your room, your toddler's room, and the playroom. You didn't explicitly say that your toddler now sleeps in what used to be the guest room, you said that the guest room is now a playroom. And then you said that the mattress from the guest room is in your toddler's room - You used two different terms to refer to those rooms, which leads me to believe you have two separate rooms for one child.\n\nYour attitude is a little bit concerning. I'm going to go with soft YTA because you seem to not care that your parents are willing to make the drive for you several times a year, it sounds like as much as they possibly can, in order to come see you.\n\nI don't understand why the basement can't be a playroom, anywhere in the house can be a playroom, it doesn't have to be a dedicated bedroom. It's easier to put a toddler in an area to play, than it is to put a guest in any area to sleep. These are not your college buddies, these are your parents. It sounds like they're not used to crashing on your couch in your living room with no privacy, they're going from a dedicated guest room with normal mattress in an actual frame, to an air mattress on the floor in the basement. That is a serious downgrade.\n\nAs others have mentioned, air mattresses can be difficult for older people, since many air mattresses require you to get on the ground to climb into them. Regardless of the height, because I know there are very tall air mattresses that mimic the height of a normal bed, air mattresses do not have the rigid structure of a normal bed frame. It's actually pretty difficult for two people to simultaneously get onto or off of an air mattress, because of the way the air flows and changes the shape of the mattress when two people are moving. It's not like getting out of a normal bed, regardless of height. Some older people need that structure and support to brace themselves when they are getting out of bed.\n\nAlso, four times per year for several nights per trip, sounds like enough time to keep your dedicated guest room. You mentioned your parents still work, I'm going to guess that when they retire, they're not going to want to see their grandchild less. You have already described about two weeks per year that your parents come over, and that number is only going to grow in the future. You have now limited the amount of time they can spend at your house. Having a dedicated playroom won't matter to your toddler, but the lack of a dedicated guest room will matter to your parents.\n\nYou also mentioned your parents live 6 hours away and visit you approximately four times per year. That is 12 hours round trip, times four, so 48 hours. I can only imagine that as they get older, it will take them longer to get to you because they will require more breaks during their trips, and they may even drive slower. You might be talking about a 13 or 14 hour round trip by the time it's all said and done. 40 minutes each way to the closest motel, assuming they come to visit you everyday per 3-day trip, that's 80 minutes to and from per day, times 3, so 240 minutes traveling to and from the hotel, on top of the 12-hour round trip to come see you anyway. And then when you factor in how much time they lose not being under the same roof as you, you're actually taking away a great deal of time from them if they chose to stay in the hotel. Which they might do, because you've made your home inhospitable to them. Plus, not only do you have to factor in the fuel it costs your parents to drive to your small town in the first place, now they have the added expense of driving to and from a hotel, on top of the nightly rate, fees, and taxes. You took something that might have cost them $100 in gas, and multiplied the expense. Even at $100 per night, multiply that by 3 and then throwing additional gas money because now they're driving more, you hugely increased the cost of your parents coming to visit you. Which, depending on their financial situation, might mean that happens less because they are saving for retirement. And once they do retire, they will be on a limited income, and might not afford to come visit you as much.\n\nBe prepared to see your parents less, for multiple reasons. Don't complain later if your parents don't visit their grandchild.\n\nIf the point of this post is to genuinely ask for feedback, you've got enough of it. If you're trying to justify turning your previously welcoming home into an unwelcoming environment for your parents, there are subs dedicated to people who hate their parents, you will probably find a lot of support there.", "Sounds like you solved it...NTA, your house is for your use.
