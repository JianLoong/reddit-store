She has 2 kids from her previous relationship (9M and 7F) but their dad isn't in the picture and I consider them my kids and they see me as a parental figure, even though they don't call me mom or anything like that.\n\nBecause I work remotely and start work later than my wife, I'm in charge of getting the kids ready in the morning and taking them to school, which can be a hassle. It's usually a fight to get them out of bed which leaves us with barely enough time to get ready and get to school on time. I always enforce they take a shower when they wake up too. That's how I grew up and I feel I just feel more refreshed and actually ready to take on the day.\n\nHowever, trying to get everything done in the morning has led to a few late drop offs at school to the point where my wife was notified. She asked me what was up and she was confused why the kids had to shower in the morning when they already shower at night. I told her the two showers a day serve different purposes -- a short one for waking up, getting a jumpstart on your day, and a longer one for cleaning up after running around all day -- and it's not unreasonable. it's what i do personally. She says since it's making the kids late to school it is unreasonable. I said then the kids gotta get up earlier, which she was not happy about.\n\nobviously i don't want the kids to be late to school, but part of the issue is these kids don't wanna get up and get started. And we've never been significantly late before, so I dunno anymore.\n\nSo AITA for making my kids shower twice a day?\n\nEDIT: I encourage speedy showers, like 5 minutes as a goal. I'm not actively trying to make them late. I'm trying to encourage a good routine. My wife is a bit more laissez-faire on the issue and says would rather let them go to school in their pj's without breakfast if it meant they'd be there on time. I'm trying to have all their needs met and if they're 10 minutes late to school, it's not the end of the world.", "created_utc": 1679438618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xxkzb/aita_for_making_my_kids_shower_too_often/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This routine is clearly not working, and forcing a change in everyone\u2019s schedule to have things done your way is selfish and unreasonable. You are a step- parent.

Just because it's how you grew up doesn't mean you have to enforce it on others. \n\nThe kids are already struggling with mornings, forcing them to get up even earlier to take a shower just because you did doesn't make sense. Just because it makes you feel ready for the day doesn't mean it works that way for them. \n\nI don't know that your framing of of it as 'they just don't wanna get started' is helpful either. Sounds like you're calling them lazy for not wanting to get up in the morning. They may not be getting enough sleep, their body clock may simply not be good at early mornings, maybe some other reasons. \n\nBut defaulting to 'these kids are being bad and lazy by not doing things how I do' is a dangerous game and rarely ends well. \n\nYWBTA if you don't listen to your wife here.", "YTA.

That is too many showers a day.", "I feel like I\u2019m probably biased because I lived for years in a place with serious drought problems where showering multiple times a day was a bit \u2018yikes,\u2019 but I feel like yeah, YTA.

Maybe it's time to try out some other strategies to help them wake up and get ready on time. Instead of taking two showers a day, maybe you could try setting a timer to help them stay on track or come up with a rewards system to motivate them.
