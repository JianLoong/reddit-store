We did everything together: studied, partied, had mental breakdowns, you name it. We went through it all *together*. We were bonded by trauma.\n\nAfter we graduated, J lived only 25 minutes away and we got together frequently, but I started to realize they were a little flaky. Sometimes at the last minute they would cancel plans without explanation. This was usually OK because I'm one of those people who sometimes makes plans and then day-of dreads the idea of having to be social. And, we lived so close that if plans were canceled one day, we'd just reschedule for another day.\n\nThings changed just before the pandemic. J moved an hour away. Luckily, J's new place was on the way to my parents' (whom I visit about 1-2x a month), so I would just stop at J's for a sleepover on Friday nights whenever I was going to my parents' place for the weekend.\n\nUnfortunately, despite me making the trip (albeit, one of convenience bc I was going to see my parents anyway but I *always* made sure to have a meaningful visit with J whenever I was going up there) J has not visited me since 2019.\n\nIn the last year, J has blown me off three times for significant events I have invited them to. First, it was a housewarming party for my new apartment. I invited people months in advance, made a FB event, the whole shebang.  J texts me 1 hour before the party and tells me that they couldn't get anyone to watch their dog (it wasn't J's dog, it was their SO's dog, and J did not live with the SO, J was just \"hanging out\" with the dog while the SO was at work), and so they couldn't come. I didn't think anything of it, was just slightly annoyed with the last-minute bullshit excuse. But, others were coming so I let it go.\n\nNext, I planned a slumber-party style night with just my three best friends (J and 2 others, they all knew one another quite well) weeks in advance. Well, you guessed it, day of, I get a text from J *after they were supposed to have been at my house* saying that one of their tires was low on air and they couldn't come. Finally, earlier this year, I had planned a small birthday gathering weeks in advance, and the night of, J texted me saying her new boyfriend (of one week) broke up with her and she was too upset to come\n\nAllegedly to make up for missing my birthday, J suggested we do a Mexico trip together. For months she would send me \"countdown to mexico\" texts about how excited she was. Nearly daily messages. Then, a month before the trip, she texts me asking if I would mind if she brought her brand new boyfriend (of one week) to mexico with her instead of me. I told her she clearly didn't value our friendship if she thought she could replace me that easily with her squeeze of the week, and that she could forget our friendship entirely. She said she was kidding, that I overreacted and that we would still go together. I refused.\n\nOk reddit, did I overreact?

This is the point of setting boundaries. She crossed yours when you invited her to things and she albeit let you know she could come, but disrespectfully waited until the last minute to tell you.

What is difficult now is being smacked with the realization of how long I let it go on before growing a backbone.  I sort of can see how shocked and upset she is because there is ZERO shot she saw this coming given how much of a doormat I have been for her.", "She wasn't joking, and she sent you the money back because she's taking the boyfriend in your place. \n\nDon't ride for people who don't ride for you - it's a hard lesson I've noticed comes with getting older/wiser.

You need to learn boundaries. It should never have gotten to this point because you should have expressed your dislike of her previous behavior.

You should have brought them up at the time but lesson learned hopefully.", "NTA. It's definitely time for you to move on from this friendship. I'm surprised to see your ages, early to mid-30's. This is behavior that I would expect from someone in their 20's. It still wouldn't be okay, but I'd have hope that maybe my friend would grow out of it. If she's 36 and is still behaving this way, she's never going to change. Take this as a learning lesson as to not invest time in one-way relationships, and instead cultivate relationships with people who value and respect you.", "Nope , she doesn\u2019t value your friendship and that is so insulting: \u201c I\u2019d rather take my boyfriend, than you.\u201d NTA.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't even call you an a-hole if you canceled while she was boarding the plane for Mexico.\n\nShe's no longer a friend and that's okay.", "NTA, we all know she wasn't kidding.", "You're fine.

That's why conversations are so important. \n\nI feel like if she cared about your feelings she would have shown up for you. Personally, I don't feel like this is on you at all.

You don't deserve it, especially since you have been giving so much of yourself to her for years without her letting you know she was more interested in her romantic relationships than in your friend relationship. There are many people out there like this, too afraid to be alone, that they jump from one relationship to another and / or leave friendships behind. I hope you surround yourself with people who love you and want to spend time with you!!", "You are not the bad guy here. Probably never were. If you want to have a conversation with J and express your feelings and thoughts on the last few years, that's a mature thing to do. It gives you a chance to lay everything out. \n\nThat said, do you honestly feel like it will make a difference? Do you truly feel that J will make reciprocal efforts to salvage the friendship? If the answer is no, then sharing your thoughts and feelings becomes an exercise in catharsis at best. It may be better to cut this one off before it festers even more. Maybe instead of the conversation, you write a letter outlining everything. \n\nEither way, you have to take care of yourself, and again, you are not the bad guy.", "Good point.  She probably hadn't bought the tickets.\n\nAirfare isn't transferable to a different person."]}
