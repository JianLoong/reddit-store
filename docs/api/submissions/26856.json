We did everything together: studied, partied, had mental breakdowns, you name it. We went through it all *together*. We were bonded by trauma.\n\nAfter we graduated, J lived only 25 minutes away and we got together frequently, but I started to realize they were a little flaky. Sometimes at the last minute they would cancel plans without explanation. This was usually OK because I'm one of those people who sometimes makes plans and then day-of dreads the idea of having to be social. And, we lived so close that if plans were canceled one day, we'd just reschedule for another day.\n\nThings changed just before the pandemic. J moved an hour away. Luckily, J's new place was on the way to my parents' (whom I visit about 1-2x a month), so I would just stop at J's for a sleepover on Friday nights whenever I was going to my parents' place for the weekend.\n\nUnfortunately, despite me making the trip (albeit, one of convenience bc I was going to see my parents anyway but I *always* made sure to have a meaningful visit with J whenever I was going up there) J has not visited me since 2019.\n\nIn the last year, J has blown me off three times for significant events I have invited them to. First, it was a housewarming party for my new apartment. I invited people months in advance, made a FB event, the whole shebang.  J texts me 1 hour before the party and tells me that they couldn't get anyone to watch their dog (it wasn't J's dog, it was their SO's dog, and J did not live with the SO, J was just \"hanging out\" with the dog while the SO was at work), and so they couldn't come. I didn't think anything of it, was just slightly annoyed with the last-minute bullshit excuse. But, others were coming so I let it go.\n\nNext, I planned a slumber-party style night with just my three best friends (J and 2 others, they all knew one another quite well) weeks in advance. Well, you guessed it, day of, I get a text from J *after they were supposed to have been at my house* saying that one of their tires was low on air and they couldn't come. Finally, earlier this year, I had planned a small birthday gathering weeks in advance, and the night of, J texted me saying her new boyfriend (of one week) broke up with her and she was too upset to come\n\nAllegedly to make up for missing my birthday, J suggested we do a Mexico trip together. For months she would send me \"countdown to mexico\" texts about how excited she was. Nearly daily messages. Then, a month before the trip, she texts me asking if I would mind if she brought her brand new boyfriend (of one week) to mexico with her instead of me. I told her she clearly didn't value our friendship if she thought she could replace me that easily with her squeeze of the week, and that she could forget our friendship entirely. She said she was kidding and I overreacted and that we would still go together. I refused.\n\nOk reddit, did I overreact?

I suspect J's request to replace you on the trip, which she later said was a joke, was only a joke after she realized it offended you and that was her half-assed gaslighty way to make you feel bad for your reaction. J has repeatedly bailed on you, each time in a pretty flimsy and lame way. I would normally advise taking the kind, emotionally-intelligent track of asking if she's doing ok, trying to get at what might be causing her to withdraw, etc. but her suggestion to replace you on the trip with her BF is really odd, tone-deaf, and mean.", "NTA it sounds like J is phasing you out of her life\u2026 sorry, mate, I would cut ties with this one over so many offenses.

Her excuses for not coming to past events sound like nonsense, but even if they aren't, they're not very good ones. She's proven time and again that she'll drop you if it's even slightly inconvenient to follow through on plans, and the \u00faexico trip would be the last straw for me too. She can't take it back or make it better by re-inviting you along; the fact she was willing to ditch you in favour of her new boyfriend to go on a trip she planned to make up for her past shittiness is indescribably rude and very unambiguous.", "Absolutely NTA. OP you have allowed yourself to be walked all over by this person for far too long. She doesn't value the friendship anywhere near as much as you do and probably never did. \n\nShe isn't your friend as friends don't treat each other this way.", "NTA She\u2019s an AH.

Honor her wish. NTA.", "It feels extra hard because of how J is taking it too, she is clearly extremely hurt and is accusing me of being the one who didn't care about our friendship since I'm the one who chose to \"throw it away over a joke.\" And I can't help thinking that there's truth to her condemnation. If I really cared about her and our friendship why can't I just get over her comment and move on? Boundaries are hard, man.", "I tend to think she was joking, because otherwise I don't understand the logistics, unless they hadn't bought flights or booked anything in advance. \n\nEdit: either way, this friendship ended awhile ago and OP is NTA for not going.", "She had this habit of calling me very frequently \"just to talk\" and was always there with advice or care when I needed her - it was always just over the phone. My mom used to call her a \"phone friend\" in that she was an amazing friend to me, just not an \"in-person\" friend. I believed this take for a long time.", "You're right, and as I dissect this issue further, and read all of your wonderful comments, I am absolutely noticing a pattern of exactly that - a friendship of \"convenience.\"", "she booked everything on her credit card and had sent me the flight/hotel booking info (we would both have been leaving from the same airport despite the distance) and I had venmoed her. My guess is now she'll just alter the bookings to reflect her bf's name instead of mine. she refunded me my $$.", "What post did you read?? J literally asked OP not to go in favor of taking her new boy toy.....I guess you must be J?", "Well, I didn't refuse her, I agreed to go with her and was just as excitedly looking forward to it as she was until she asked to swap me out with her new beau. I just felt really crushed by her so flippantly acting like she could replace me.", "No, OP was not harsh at all. She asserted her boundaries against a person who has been stomping all over them for far too long.\n\nStop defending assholes and assholish behaviour.", "She's projecting what she did to you, as you doing to her. She got caught up in her own stuff and clearly wasn't making you a priority on dates that you respectfully planned in advance. \n\nAsking to invite your new boyfriend to Mexico is not a joke. She seriously considered it and even asked, and is NOW claiming it was a joke. \n\nYou guys need to have a chat about how you've been feeling neglected, how she's clearly had her head up her own ass lately, and how you feel completely disrespected over her non-joke joke. This is the point of setting boundaries. She crossed yours when you invited her to things and she albeit let you know she could come, but disrespectfully waited until the last minute to tell you. She crossed them again by trying to make a trip meant to be about you and your friendship, about her and her new BF. \n\nI'm not saying end your friendship, do what you want, but be aware that her behavior isn't going to change bc she is showing you who she is and how much she cares. \n\nDon't be mad or sad that you're seeing her for who she truly is. This is an exercise in self-awareness and I hope you can put her behavior to bed by either speaking to her or removing a person who clearly isn't serving you anymore.", "NTA.  I don't think it was a joke.  She was testing your reaction.  She's flaked on at least three occasions.  What do you get out of this, other than a sunk cost?  Your relationship has been one way for quite some time.", "For info: she had booked everything in advance on her CC and I had venmoed her my part. After this incident, she venmoed me back my $$.", "If it was a joke then what was the funny part?", "I'm guessing she is already in another path. You have your own place, things to be proud of. J might not have anything to brag about. Some friendships just vanish.", "well it's nice that you got a refund at least!", "This is really helpful, thank you for the thought-out response, Burbs. \n\nYou are right, J absolutely has shown me who she is, but I can't help but feel like part of the blame is on me because *I taught her it was OK to treat me this way.* It's almost not J's fault because historically, I have let her walk all over me and take advantage of me and she's always just gotten away with it because I valued what I considered our friendship more than it was worth it to me to stand my ground on each of those things. What is difficult now is being smacked with the realization of how long I let it go on before growing a backbone.  I sort of can see how shocked and upset she is because there is ZERO shot she saw this coming given how much of a doormat I have been for her.", "She wasn't joking, and she sent you the money back because she's taking the boyfriend in your place. \n\nDon't ride for people who don't ride for you - it's a hard lesson I've noticed comes with getting older/wiser. Maybe we tolerate the lack of care of respect less, or maybe it becomes more apparent.", "Well, sounds like the trip is off. At least she gave you back your money.", "Did you ever see the tickets or did she just tell you she booked it already and told you a price?", "Are you seriously unaware of people doing dumb prank adjacent stuff like this as jokes, and what the humor is supposed to be?", "I would check her insta/face/X after.
