{"id": 24795, "submission_id": "15stmzj", "title": "AITA for not wanting my BIL\u2019s gf in my home?", "selftext": "I (32F) and my husband (29M) just had our 1st child 5 weeks ago. Back in December when we were inviting family and close friends to our gender reveal party, my husband told my BIL that while we really hope he is able to come to the gender reveal, we would request he not bring his gf.  He asked this upon my request. While BIL acted totally fine with this, he no showed the party last minute and he has been very distant with my husband, turning down all his requests to hang out, whether in person or online via playing games etc, and he has shown no interest in meeting our child.\n\nBackstory -\nBIL (33M) and gf (we will refer to her as Ally) worked together (they have both since been fired due to bad work ethic and excessive call outs). I had met Ally and her fianc\u00e9 at a company BBQ back in 2020. She came off quite condescending and rude, and both my husband and I were not fans. Her fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, was great and we are FB friends. \nAlly is very involved in witchcraft and has made this her identity. Her social media pages have lots of dark imagery, satanic references, upside down crosses, etc. Ppl can believe what they want, but as a Christian, her beliefs and practices make me uncomfortable, so while I have no problem being around her, I don\u2019t want to discuss witchcraft 24/7, which she tends to do. \n\nLast year, several family members in husband\u2019s family had passed away. About a week before one of the funerals, BIL calls husband while we are at dinner. I ask to speak to him since I haven\u2019t talked to him in a while, so he passes me the phone. The first thing BIL asks me is if I remember Ally (mind you, I am unaware of anything between them, and am also 3 glasses of wine deep at this point). I say yes, and express how I thought she was extremely annoying and obnoxious, but how cool her fianc\u00e9 is. He then tells me Ally is his date to the funeral and asks me to not tell Ally\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and that he\u2019s using the funeral to introduce his new gf to the family\u2026 I straight up tell him that a funeral is not the place to introduce your gf, and also probably not a good idea to be in a cheating relationship, none the less take her as a date everywhere (he\u2019s never spoken to me again since this phone call). \n\nNeedless to say, he brought her as his date to all the funerals and requested people not post photos so her fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t see. At the funerals, Ally made multiple comments about her strong distaste for the ceremonies being Christian funerals and how offensive it was to her.\n\nI told husband that I don\u2019t feel comfortable with this public display of cheating, nor her constant talk of witchcraft and bashing of my faith. I have no problem dealing with it elsewhere, I just don\u2019t want all this negativity in my home. \n\nAITA for not supporting this relationship and not wanting her in my home?", "created_utc": 1692201132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15stmzj/aita_for_not_wanting_my_bils_gf_in_my_home/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I don't believe in judging anyone's religion. I do not have to agree with it but I don't have to disrespect it either. \nShe has moved in with your brother-in-law so they may actually be serious. You may not agree with the relationship but it's his choice to be with her. You don't have to let her in your home. But this is the woman he's with and if she isn't welcomed he may stay away as well.\nIf your husband told you he was invited to an event by his brother but you were not invited I'm sure he wouldn't feel comfortable going to see his brother any more either if you were not welcomed there. And he would be right because your spouse becomes your new family just like you told him his brothers gf is not welcomed and he bowed and said ok. And just like when he said don't tell her fiance and you bowed and said okay. \nAt the end of the day you don't have to live with her, sleep with her or practice her religion. So why let it bother you you made a decision to not welcome his gf and he made one to stay away.\nYour husband and his brother are who pays the consequences.", "NTA.

But a culturally significant ceremony about someone's wedding, birth, life, or death is not the time to go on a rant about people's beliefs and values. The time to do that is when a molesting pastor is in the news or someone commits a crime in God's name. Then you can go off on them.\n\nAnd while you are free to criticize religion in the US without government persecution, it doesn't mean there are no interpersonal consequences. (Like not getting invited into certain people's homes)\n\nAlso, don't date a cheater. It's wrong, it will come back to bite you and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases is higher.", "NTA but you will be T A if you don\u2019t provide updates on this absolute trainwreck waiting to happen", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"he no showed the party last minute and he has been very distant with my husband, turning down all his requests to hang out, whether in person or online via playing games etc, and he has shown no interest in meeting our child.\" .. what else did you expect?

Like...I also feel like so often I see the phrase cheating is cheating when bringing up an emotional affair vs a physical affair, but then there's this shit. Just like finding out your partner has a whole other family, this is a whole other level than talking to someone else or sending nudes. Like this man really out here bringing someone else's fiance to his family FUNERAL and expects everyone to just.....turn a blind eye and thinks the gf's fiance is never gonna find out? At least have some British High Society Decorum if you gonna be a shitty person to your partner?", "Something tells me Ally only wanted to go to the funerals to say how offensive she found them ...", "Thank you!!", "Omg she's not broken up with her fiancee?

I think they may have finally broken off the engagement, but we do know that this affair had been going on for about a year prior to the funerals!

The cheating is reason enough to not want it in your home.", "My husband isn\u2019t okay with it, he can\u2019t stand the situation or the girl, but BIL has a reputation of making very immature and irrational decisions, so husband knows that if he gets involved that BIL will not handle it well.

Do you have to like who he is sleeping with and if so why? You have said she's not welcome he doesn't bring her he just don't come himself either. He chooses his gf the same as your hubby would choose you. Are you the AH for it no..but you shouldn't be surprised that it's causing a wedge between brothers.
