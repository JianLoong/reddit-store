Back in December when we were inviting family and close friends to our gender reveal party, my husband told my BIL that while we really hope he is able to come to the gender reveal, we would request he not bring his gf.  He asked this upon my request. While BIL acted totally fine with this, he no showed the party last minute and he has been very distant with my husband, turning down all his requests to hang out, whether in person or online via playing games etc, and he has shown no interest in meeting our child.\n\nBackstory -\nBIL (33M) and gf (we will refer to her as Ally) worked together (they have both since been fired due to bad work ethic and excessive call outs). I had met Ally and her fianc\u00e9 at a company BBQ back in 2020. She came off quite condescending and rude, and both my husband and I were not fans. Her fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, was great and we are FB friends. \nAlly is very involved in witchcraft and has made this her identity. Her social media pages have lots of dark imagery, satanic references, upside down crosses, etc. Ppl can believe what they want, but as a Christian, her beliefs and practices make me uncomfortable, so while I have no problem being around her, I don\u2019t want to discuss witchcraft 24/7, which she tends to do. \n\nLast year, several family members in husband\u2019s family had passed away. About a week before one of the funerals, BIL calls husband while we are at dinner. I ask to speak to him since I haven\u2019t talked to him in a while, so he passes me the phone. The first thing BIL asks me is if I remember Ally (mind you, I am unaware of anything between them, and am also 3 glasses of wine deep at this point). I say yes, and express how I thought she was extremely annoying and obnoxious, but how cool her fianc\u00e9 is. He then tells me Ally is his date to the funeral and asks me to not tell Ally\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and that he\u2019s using the funeral to introduce his new gf to the family\u2026 I straight up tell him that a funeral is not the place to introduce your gf, and also probably not a good idea to be in a cheating relationship, none the less take her as a date everywhere (he\u2019s never spoken to me again since this phone call). \n\nNeedless to say, he brought her as his date to all the funerals and requested people not post photos so her fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t see. At the funerals, Ally made multiple comments about her strong distaste for the ceremonies being Christian funerals and how offensive it was to her.\n\nI told husband that I don\u2019t feel comfortable with this public display of cheating, nor her constant talk of witchcraft and bashing of my faith. I have no problem dealing with it elsewhere, I just don\u2019t want all this negativity in my home. \n\nAITA for not supporting this relationship and not wanting her in my home?", "created_utc": 1692201132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15stmzj/aita_for_not_wanting_my_bils_gf_in_my_home/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And he would be right because your spouse becomes your new family just like you told him his brothers gf is not welcomed and he bowed and said ok. And just like when he said don't tell her fiance and you bowed and said okay. \nAt the end of the day you don't have to live with her, sleep with her or practice her religion.

But a culturally significant ceremony about someone's wedding, birth, life, or death is not the time to go on a rant about people's beliefs and values. The time to do that is when a molesting pastor is in the news or someone commits a crime in God's name. Then you can go off on them.\n\nAnd while you are free to criticize religion in the US without government persecution, it doesn't mean there are no interpersonal consequences. (Like not getting invited into certain people's homes)\n\nAlso, don't date a cheater.

I don\u2019t think Ally is the only one at fault, I think BIL is equally in the wrong, possibly more so since he pursued her knowing full well that she was engaged.\n2. I believe Ally and the fianc\u00e9 have finally broken up, I think. \n3. For context, BIL\u2019s growth was stunted due to medical issues as a child, so his physical appearance is more like a 16 year old rather than a man in his 30\u2019s. He already looks a bit feminine due to lack of testosterone, but even more so since they started dating. Ally, prior to dating BIL was a very outspoken lesbian (fianc\u00e9 was a woman), making comment after comment about how much she hates men, so dating BIL is a bit suspicious to many of us. I bring that up to say that it seems like BIL is trying to look more like a female for her (and no, he\u2019s not metro or fem or anything like that, just a straight guy who looks feminine due to medical reasons)\n4. The 1st funeral was a very traumatic one as it was for a close relative that committed suicide, which is why I found it very inappropriate to use it as an opportunity to introduce your affair gf.  \n5.  My husband is against the relationship as well, however, the reason he doesn\u2019t cut BIL off or did not want me to tell fianc\u00e9 was due to BIL\u2019s lack of maturity, as he would NOT handle the situation the way a normal adult would. He tends to have more temper tantrums rather than conversations. His maturity was also a bit stunted due to the medical issues, so everyone treads lightly around him in regards to sensitive issues.", "NTA. \n\nMy atheist dad who lives in a mostly Catholic country, and me a pagan who lives in the US, go to weddings, baptisms, funerals in Catholic/Christian churches all the time.
