I'm a nanny and I'm paid for what I would work regardless of if they decide they don't need me those hours. You can't be expected to block that time off for them, and not be paid for those hours. You made those hours unavailable to other plans FOR THEM. They need to pay, your time is money. They need to plan better.", "I agree with this, but only if it was stated ahead of time. It\u2019s not polite on the parents\u2019 end bec OP might have not agreed knowing what hours/how much to expect from this Jo - but not worth the bad feelings and potentially losing future work (or maybe OP feels this is a hill to die on). Maybe split the difference? Moving forward, mention this is your policy so this is clearly understood and no hard feelings. Still saying NTA", " \nYou decide what is reasonable notice for cancellation.", "Yes! I'm a nanny and I block my schedule off for those hours. You ate expected to pay. I can't agree to a time and just not show up.", "Just be wary, the dad is likely not going to pay you (or pay you less) the next few times you come to \u201crecoup his losses\u201d.", "NTA. The service was being available to do what they needed to do at a specific time. You were. Sounds like they don't seem to think your time is worth much.", "NTA. That said, pick your battles wisely. Consider: are they repeat clients, or likely to be repeat clients? If so, offer the refund with the reminder that your policy requires an x hour notice for cancellation.", "NTA! Stand your ground", "Nta. Don't pay them back.", "I think it was poor form for them to ask for anything back. NTA", "NTA. This is exactly what any childcare service does. \n\nI still had to pay for my kid\u2019s daycare if we were on vacation. Why? To ensure they had a spot to come back to. \n\nThis is very normal practice.", "NTA. Them not saying anything until last minute means you were unable to plan something else (example: another babysitting gig) to earn money. You should have a policy about cancellations/grace period.", "NTA. As someone who babysat for multiple families as a teenager, by them not telling you ahead of time (24 or 48 hours) that they did not need you for the morning pickup, you would have had to turn down others that may have wanted your services. If they did not give you a reasonable amount of notice that you were no longer needed for the morning, they should still have to pay the agreed upon price. If you wanted to be nice, you could pay them back for the days that were outside of the cancellation period.", "NTA - it's a penalty fee for playing games with your time.", "NTA.", "NTA.  You can refund the money and not work for them anymore.  Good suggestions regarding cancellation policy.", "This. OP, but I would send them a text, \"I'm going to go ahead and refund you the money, however, I won't be watching your kids again. Just like with any job, I reserve time to watch your kids, and I count on the money I make. For you to cancel on me at the last minute and demand the money you paid me to be returned, it shows me you don't appreciate my time or my efforts. I'd rather work for someone who does.\" If they get mad, saying that you can't cancel on them at the last minute, remind them that if they can cancel on you at the last minute, why can't you do the same?\n\nIf your area is anything like mine, parents are DESPERATE for sitters. Work with people who appreciate you. Seriously. If your mom has an issue with it, SHE can watch them.\n\n(OP, this is from someone who was a babysitter, and a nanny, and who has hired babysitters and nannies.)", "Yes. It was really shitty of them to cancel on short notice and waste her time but they also don't have any kind of cancellation agreement. This is why everything needs to be discussed and there needs to be a paper trail.", "While it would have been nice if OP had spelled out everything, it is common for cancelling professional services.  You want me to use my time for your service, then you change your mind and don't want to pay me?  No.", "If anything, the preservation of the relationship should mean automatically assuming you are going to pay for your friend's time you reserved and agreed to pay them for.", "I still understand your point, but it\u2019s all based on the assumption that OP had other opportunities. I agree if she had other opportunities, you pay I full. But we don\u2019t know that she did.", "If you book a hotel stay for three days and tell them on the first day of your reservation that you actually need to cancel do you think they're going to say \"oh well you're too late for a 24hr notice for today, but we'll refund you for the remaining days since it's technically still 24hrs before those\" No, they'll consider the whole thing one booking and you have until 24 hrs before the first day to cancel otherwise you're out the money for the whole lot. \n\nSame applies here. They \"booked\" her for the whole week, if they don't let her know plans have changed before that week starts, they don't get to play the petty pedantic game of \"well technically...\" when it comes to how much notice she was given and demand their money back.", "It doesn't matter if she got it back. She didn't choose to get it back - getting it back was forced on her after she had already held the time for them. If you book someone for their time and you cancel, you still pay them, barring the presence of a cancellation/refund policy.", "NTA I used to be a Nanny and babysat all through college.  I would refund them the money.  The refund is a one time courtesy and we will no longer be available to watch their kids. You couldn't book anyone else because of the last minute cancellation.  Since they are involving your Mother inform her you expect her to back you up in this.  You will not be taken advantage of by people.", "NTA. They were paying you for the week, not hourly, and you made yourself available for those hours. It's their problem they chose not to utilize the service they paid for. In future, with anyone else you babysit for, you may want to start having a written contract that parents sign that includes your cancellation policy. And if your mom thinks they should be paid back, ask if she would expect to be paid if she showed up at work and her boss told her only then that she didn't need to be there. Your time is valuable; don't let anyone take advantage of it.", "I work agency for both disability support and youth work. Both agencies have a cancellation window. If you cancel less that 24 hours out one company charges for three hours and the other charges for the whole shift. You had arrived on site before they said anything, that's their poor planning. I wouldn't send them anything back.", "agreed. You had already made a verbal/text contract. You've already made accommodations to do your job and possibly missed out on other work.   \nNext time though, I'd include a \"24 hour notice clause\" or something similar.", "NTA- I think you are within your rights for Wednesday because you were at work on time as requested. I think you should give back Thursday and Friday's pickup money, but tell them that if they reserve the time in the future you need more notice.", "NTA. We even pay my pet sitter as soon as we request her services and we let her keep the money if we cancel, because she arranged her schedule around us. And in our minds, this is how you stay a top priority client, if your sitter gets multiple requests for the same dates. If we can do it for a pet sitter, surely it makes sense for a baby sitter.", "You would be if you do it as a living like a business or if they gave you a couple of days before the change. You should refund it if it\u2019s ample time. Imagine buying something needs delivery then don\u2019t need it . If company had time to change then you would want your money back.", "Nope, they prepaid which is just like a deposit. If they wanted to change the arrangement they needed to give you sufficient notice to do so.", "NTA and shame upon them. Your mum needs to value your time and stand up to him.", "If you do refund them, refund the wife. \n\nThe wife is one who paid you, not the husband.", "leniency goes both ways though. why is it that the person who pays gets to benefit from leniency whereas the person who works have to shoulder extra burden?\n\n\"But I would hope a friend would understand last minute changes.\" is just a way of saying you don't want to do the understanding yourself. You want the other person to take on a burden that you have introduced, its unfair. \n\nMy way of handling friendly business is as follows: I over pay, and I expect the work to be over-done. that's a better way of doing business because instead of both sides looking to have leniency for themselves and have to suffer giving leniency to the other person, both sides are happy."]}
