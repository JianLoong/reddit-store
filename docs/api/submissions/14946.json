I get feeling like nothing is your own but:\n\n1. You cannot expect your parents to feel that way. They have 2 kids. \n\n2. As you become older and more independent of your family, you will have lots of birthdays with the people you chose to celebrate with. \n\n3. You need to work through your feeling with your sister.

Happy birthday.", "I would say YTA for expecting your parents to ignore their other daughter. I am sorry about your past birthdays, though. They should have done things differently. You are two people with two birthdays (on the same day). Since you have two very different personalities, you should have two different birthday parties. One for you with the things that you like and one for your sister with whatever she wants to do. Birthday parties don't necessarily have to happen on the exact same day you were born (school/jobs make that difficult), so this could work for both of you.

We went to different schools after 5th grade (nothing to do with fighting) and we now live 6000 miles apart which seems to work best (we fight almost everytime we get together still at 46 years old). I cannot imagine trying to dictate my parents not to include their other daughter in her own birthday (or even not wanting to include her myself). I say this as a person who has spent my last 29 birthdays in a different country/continent than my parents&sister while they were all together.

Even if you don't have friends irl, plan a nice fun day for yourself, maybe meet your online friends on a call to watch or play something.

It\u2019s not just your birthday. Your parents have two daughters they want to celebrate and while I understand you\u2019re upset you can\u2019t really expect them to not want their other child to come home to see family. \n\nWithout specifics it\u2019s hard to judge your relationship with your sister.

It's her 21st birthday.  Your home is her home.  If you want a birthday all to yourself, plan a trip, plan a birthday, and skip your sister's birthday.", "Hi OP! I saw you said that you don\u2019t have any friends locally/\u2018in real life,\u2019 so it must be really frustrating to get a lot of advice saying to go out with friends. Since that sounds not possible, I highly recommend a virtual party with your online friend(s). I\u2019ve had online friends since I was in middle school, and I\u2019ve had some of the best virtual celebrations with them. This could look like something low key, like watching something all at the same time and messaging each other, getting on a big Zoom and playing a game (one year we did Scattergories but specifically topics related to the birthday person), and that was really fun! I know it feels like a bummer to have your plans squashed and feel unheard by your parents. There are still ways to make your birthday special. \n\nNAH", "YTA. You're 21 - go out with your friends instead of blaming your parents for wanting to see their other child on her 21st birthday.\n\nYou're turning 21 - time to grow up.", "NAH. Can you go away?", "Sweetie, I have a very extroverted and sociable twin brother, so I get that the two of you don\u2019t want to do the same things. My brother and I rarely want to do the same things too. We\u2019re 25 now, so we\u2019ve had a little more time to figure out how to make things work for us. \n\nThe first thing you need to do is stop thinking about having a birthday to yourself. Even if you aren\u2019t with your sister, you will never have a birthday to yourself. You will always be sharing it. There was a birthday my brother and I had where we were in different states and time zones, so you know what he did? He called me at midnight in his time zone so he could joke about being older than me for the first time in our lives. My cookie cake still had his name on it because he\u2019s my twin brother and it\u2019s his birthday too and I love him. \n\nYour sister loves you. It\u2019s important to her to be home and share this birthday with her family, including you, because you are an integral part of her life. Now, it\u2019s okay to have wanted to do your own thing. And you still can. You\u2019re almost 21! Make a new tradition of going out to get yourself a slice of cake if you get tired of whatever is going on at this celebration. Or schedule a call with your Internet friends so they can sing happy birthday to you. Or talk to your sister and tell her how you feel when she pushes, because I really doubt it\u2019s malicious. I think she just doesn\u2019t understand that you\u2019re enjoying yourself in your own way, so talk to her. \n\nAnd stop taking this as a personal attack. It wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just your family doing their best, okay? You\u2019re not an AH and neither are they, but if you decide to spend your whole birthday and the time leading up to it angry, you will be. Not because you\u2019re angry, but because people aren\u2019t particularly nice to be around when they\u2019re angry. You\u2019re going to be okay. NAH.", "I think this depends on motive and what exactly the plans are. You seem to be heavily implying that they are doing this to just piss you off, in which case you aren't the AH, but I'm not sure that's all there is to it.\n\n\nIf this is your parents convincing her to come home, with some misguided \"you should be home for your birthday\" and she'd rather spend it with her friends, they are the AHs. \n\n\nIf she wants to come home for her birthday, and do stuff maybe with HS friends and it's a convenient weekend, you're the AH for making it about you (not for being upset).\n\n\nAnd what were your plans for your birthday? Was it a special dinner with your parents or something? Or just that you didn't want her present at all even if she does something different. Do you make any effort to make plans with friends?\n\n\nWhere was she for her 19 and 20th birthdays?", "This sounds complicated.  You aren't the asshole for your feelings, and wanting to spend your birthday alone.  But, you also are kind of the AH because you are trying to keep your parents from seeing their child on her birthday.\n\nI know you say you have no friends.  If that's the case, it may still be best not to celebrate with your sister if you are feeling upset about her presence.  Maybe you could take the day alone to go to the park and a movie?", "YTA\u2014 coming from another twin, I hate to break it to you, but the birthday will never just be about you, especially to your parents. They have 2 children not just 1 celebrating that day. \n\nYou can do whatever you want for your birthday, you can even do it a day later just to do something on your own. But you cannot expect your parents to only cater to you.", "NTA\n\nI would make other plans for the day, the weekend or whatever, so you do not have to see your twin.  When your family asks why, please them the truth.  Why you felt like you have never had a party and its always  been about your sister.  \n\nTell them that you feel invisible or that she is the family's favourite or however you feel.\n\nHopefully this birthday can be about making some boundaries with your family.  \n\nEnjoy the day!", "You're NTA for feeling upset. I understand feeling overshadowed by a sibling. It must be so much worse when you're a twin, but I understand where your mum is coming from too. She's not trying to hurt you, you're both her children and she wants to see her children on their birthday. Also, your sister is away studying far away ( I'm assuming, as she needs a plane to get home), your mum must miss her and wants to spend that special day with both of you. \nThat doesn't take away the hurt you feel and I'm sorry you won't get that special day to yourself. I'd suggest planning something with just your friends so that you still have something where you're the focus.", "NTA. Seeing as you don't have any friends, I wouldn't have changed plans last minute, and celebrate with you, if I were your parent. I hope you can at least boycott the party.", "Another vote for NTA for just wanting a special day to yourself. Think of your own special day what you like best and make it that! But your parents aren't punishing you by wanting to spend your birthday with the both of you.", "I was gonna say N.A.H, but it's YTA for me. I can understand your point, but you're 21. If you want a birthday for yourself then go out and celebrate with your friends. If your family is pressuring you to attend the joint birthday then they'll be the AHs but you can totally decline their request.", "OP. What is it you like to do?  Hobbies? Likes? Dislikes?  Throw yourself into those things and find your tribe. I was in a similar situation. Took me years to find myself. But I did, and you can too.", "NTA Your feelings are what they are. But it\u2019s also your sister\u2019s birthday and she should be able to celebrate in a way that she\u2019ll enjoy.\n\nIt seems like you blame your sister for being different than you. Her outgoing nature annoys you and your autism probably causes you to experience her personality traits in an amplified way. Keep in mind, this isn\u2019t her fault. If you\u2019d like to be accepted as you are, you should learn to accept others as they are. \n\nYou can graciously excuse yourself from activities that you find overstimulating and plan a separate birthday celebration that\u2019s more to your liking. No need to get hung up on it occurring on your actual birthday. What\u2019s important is that you\u2019re celebrated, not which day it happens.", "YTA. And quite clearly jealous.", "YTA. You say you don\u2019t have friends of your own, that\u2019s hardly your sisters fault. Not trying to be rude but it\u2019s just not. It\u2019s ridiculous to hold that against her. Maybe, instead of being worried about \u201cher overshadowing you\u201d, just go out with her and maybe you\u2019ll make some friends of your own.", "Can you go out to do things you like that day. Ignore her maybe get noise canceling headphones", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NTA but if you push this you absolutely will be. Your parents want to celebrate you both. Could you ask to do two separate  things for you guys? Also everyone saying your the asshole and to go out with your own friends can fuck off cause clearly they do not know what it is like to not have friends", "NTA - from everything you've said, it's understandable that you're upset and that doesn't make you the AH. \n\nI don't think your twin is the AH in this specific scenario either (although it sounds like she's been one in the past) - she can come home for her birthday if she wants, and maybe she doesn't know you feel this way. \n\nYour dad is an AH though for extending the offer when he knew you felt that way, and when your twin already had plans. \n\nNow that she's coming, maybe you can ask your mom if you could all have a discussion about boundaries, explaining how you feel because of your twins behaviour in the past? \n\nOr alternatively go out and do things you enjoy, you're not obligated to spend it with your twin even if she's back home. Hope you have a good birthday in spite of it all!", "YTA\n\nYou say that it always felt like every birthday was about her and that you got pushed to the sidelines.\n \nAnd then in the edit you add that you have no friends? Well, I'm sorry, but maybe you are not a very nice person. \nBeing autistic does make it harder to make friends, but most autistic people do manage to make some friends and maintain those relationships. \nIf you had parties together (me and my twin mostly did) and you both got to invite friends, but you did not have any friends or invite any friends, then off course the party is going to centre around your sister. \n\n\nHaving to compromise on the birthday dinner and cake flavour can suck if it always ends up with you not getting something you like, but then it's not a compromise. Me and my sister understood that neither of us would get out favourite meal, but we always managed to figure something out that we both liked. \nAnd we are also very different people. Think of a hyperactive nerdy fun loving tomboy for me and a horse crazy serious studious girl for my sister. We do not like the same type of food and have very different friends. But we still always found a way to have a nice birthday together. \nWe do however truly like, love and respect each other and it doesn't sound like you like your sister. It sounds like you resent her for being who she is. She can't help who she is and neither can you. I think it's time to get some therapy and figure out why you think your sister overshadows you. Why you feel that she needs to not be herself so you can bed moet comfortabel?", "I am so sorry this is your situation.  It is difficult to share the spotlight when someone else has had it your whole lives.  You can't control what other people do, but you can control yourself and how you respond to situations.\n\nBe your own cheerleader.  Don't depend on your parents or your twin for validation.  Participate only as much as you want to in the birthday situation with your family.  When things start to become difficult for you at the party, you can leave the situation and go to your room, and celebrate with your online friends.  Or by yourself even.  Treat yourself with some new make-up, or book, watch a movie while eating cake and ice cream, whatever you like.  Happy 21st to you, OP.

I lost my twin 4 years ago and would do anything to spend the day with her.  One of our favorite days of the year has become unbearable for me, I dread it.  We also didn\u2019t always see eye to eye, had completely different personalities.  We personally saw that as an advantage.  I can\u2019t imagine my parents having to pick between seeing her or I.", "NAH\n\nCan\u2019t your family have two celebrations?

Go celibrate with your friends somewhere else.", "ESH. \n\nEveryone is at fault for part of this. Your mom got your hopes up that your birthday would be just you,  then they changed plans and are now dismissing and minimizing your feelings. That sucks. Changing plans can be massively upsetting to golks in the spectrum. But your sister is a daughter to them so i get that,  too. Listen, I totally get not wanting to share a major birthday with someone who steals the spotlight and makes you feel uncomfortable. All around everyone carries some responsibility about how this is turned shitty.\n\nThat said you'll have to deal with it\n Maybe you can explain you feel overshadowed by your sister and would like to celebrate your birthdays individually. One day for you. One day for her. Though it's unlikely they will it would give you both the chance to feel like you have \"your\" special day and also focus on the others special day.

Given that the original comment also mentioned going out alone.", "I wasn\u2019t trying to assume anything about OP, just reacting to your incredulity that people might not be comfortable planning a party with friends.", "I assumed it meant that OP was an adult who could make their own decisions to go out into the world without their parents and make their own plan.\n\nIf these parents are supposedly \u201cruining\u201d OP\u2019s birthday, for what reason would they want to hang out at home?", "I was implying that op is definitely old enough to go out and have fun with friends(or by herself). It\u2019s not like she\u2019s underaged and needs permission from her parents to do anything.", "We\u2019re all making assumptions because none of us are the OP. We don\u2019t know what they would like. They told us they don\u2019t have friends but not what they actually want to do on their birthday, so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fair game guess. Original comment was totally fine.", "I\u2019m not. I\u2019m trying to point out that you are both assuming what the OP wants. We all are. They haven\u2019t told us what they want to do for their birthday and at the time of this comment, they hadn\u2019t edited to say they had no friends to hang with, so it\u2019s a totally reasonable assumption to make. It\u2019s also reasonable to say they wouldn\u2019t want to spend the day alone and that since they\u2019re 21, they\u2019re fully capable of choosing something\u2014anything\u2014else to do. \n\nThis is all hypotheticals. No one needs to be bashed for assumptions on what a hypothetical birthday should be.", "Not so much incredulity as just trying to point out that everyone is assuming here.", "How is it bashing to make a single statement? \n\nGoing out alone is also functionally still spending the day alone."]}
