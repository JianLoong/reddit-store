For some background info, We don\u2019t have a lot of money for a big wedding ceremony/celebration but it has to be done in 2 months since one of our relatives is visiting from the army and it is very important that she\u2019s there (we don\u2019t know how long until she comes back). We\u2019re just gonna get married legally at a courthouse by signing the papers and have a small dinner with immediate family and VERY close friends. In the family side, both of my parents are coming but i have no siblings. On his side his parents and 4 siblings are coming. \n\nI am only inviting 2 friends that I have been very close with for 5+ years, he is inviting 3 friends that he has been friends with for 10+ years. Like i said, close friends. He has meet my friends multiple times and I have met his. We like each other even if i don\u2019t have a lot in common with his friends still. It\u2019s important to know his best friend Logan has a very young baby with his longterm girlfriend (I have also met her a few times, not as much because of being busy with the baby understandably) who is also coming to the dinner to celebrate our wedding. \n\nThe problem comes when, this morning, Tom told me he wanted to invite his other friend\u2019s girlfriend. Let\u2019s call this other friend Joe. Joe has only been with his girlfriend maybe a month or so and just got out of his previous relationship less than a month before he entered this new one. Tom says that it\u2019s not fair Logan\u2019s girlfriend is coming but Joe\u2019s isn\u2019t and that he doesn\u2019t wanna tell him he can\u2019t bring her.  I told him we both haven\u2019t met this girl and don\u2019t even know her name. I myself didn\u2019t even know he was dating somebody else until last night. And i reminded him it\u2019s only an intimate dinner with family and friends who at this point are also family to us. \n\nHe got irritated at the fact that i didn\u2019t wanna invite his gf saying it would only add 1 more person and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re suddenly inviting 10+ more people. I told him there\u2019s still 2 months before the wedding and if we both meet and like her beforehand, she\u2019s allowed to come. He then said that we work long hours and might not find a chance to meet her and wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to meet her at the dinner. I told him i wouldn\u2019t want a stranger there even if it was one of my best friend\u2019s new gf/bf. He believes that if it was about my friend\u2019s, I\u2019d be okay with the idea, which i wouldn\u2019t be either way. \n\nHe got mad and said \u201cI just won\u2019t invite Joe at all then\u201d like i didn\u2019t just say i\u2019m flexible with her coming if we meet her beforehand. I told him that obviously Joe will attend i explained AGAIN just don\u2019t feel comfortable with her there since everyone else there is basically family and she\u2019s a stranger to us right now. \n\nHe said i was making a big deal out of nothing and left for work.

It\u2019s been planned as an intimate, family and very close friends, event from the start. \n\nHe\u2019s now trying to force a change to that on you. \n\nPersonally, I would retract your attempt at a compromise - because it won\u2019t make either of you happy. \n\nGo back to basics:\n\n- we agreed it would be (this)\n\n- now you are trying to force me to accept a change\n\n- what makes you think that this is the best way to discuss a difference of opinion\n\n  - honestly, it feels a lot like bullying & throwing a tantrum to me\n\n  - is this how you see our differences being worked out once we are married? You\u2019ll throw a tantrum if I don\u2019t immediately get on board with you wanting to go back on something we have previously agreed to do?\n\n- do you disagree that previously you were on board with the small, intimate event - with a bigger party for plus ones at a later date?\n\n- why are you suddenly uncomfortable with him coming alone, when he knows your mutual friends etc, so will have company ?\n\n  - has he been pressuring you to make an exception for him? \n\n  - if not, why are you pushing this so strongly, if he\u2019s not fussed?\n\n  - if he is:  why are you letting him push you into agreeing to something that will make your bride unhappy on her wedding day?\n\n- **please explain to me why you think it\u2019s more important to make your friend happy on our wedding day, at expense of my own comfort & happiness?**\n\n- keeping it small & intimate as planned is REALLY important to me \n\n  - I will need to understand WHY your new request (to allow a stranger *who he might not even still be dating in 2 months\u2019 time*) is equally or more important to you, than my preference is to me \n\n  - so please explain\u2026..", "NTA, but this is a taste of what your marriage will be like\u2014is this really what you want, arguing with an intractable childish person over things that don\u2019t really matter for the rest of your life?", "NTA.\nYou\u2019re allowed to want/not want people to come to your own wedding celebration. And with a new SO you haven\u2019t men, it\u2019s totally fair. When my husband and I first got together a closed friend of his that I hadn\u2019t met got married. I wasnt\u2019 invited, I didn\u2019t even want to go, I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s so important that Joe/his GF are insisting. \nIf they\u2019re being so pushy/sensitive about it it suggests someone in the relationship is having some sort of unhealthy obsession. One month together is not long enough to be that way.", "YTA.  It\u2019s also your husband\u2019s wedding, you seem to have forgotten this.", "NTA", "Sorry, but YTA because of this: \u201cif we both meet and like her beforehand.\u201d\n\nWhat if you *don\u2019t* like her? You\u2019re going to say, oh we met her but no, sorry, she can\u2019t come? How\u2019s that going to go? I understand you\u2019re trying to compromise, but this puts everyone in a weird position.\n\nI also get that for you this is an extremely small and intimate event. With his family being so much bigger than yours and Logan already bringing his GF, it\u2019s sort of in a different size category. It\u2019s not his fault for having siblings who he wants to have at his wedding. But you\u2019re only bringing two friends (no partners, it seems?) and he wants three, with partners.\n\nIf you really want to put your foot down about the size, you could go that route (although it might not go over well). What\u2019s AH behavior is trying to gatekeep the acceptability of other peoples\u2019 partners. I do understand this is an extremely new relationship and it\u2019s a small event. It\u2019s just far preferable to have a yes/no policy on partners rather than picking and choosing.", "It\u2019s either NAH or ESH and I can\u2019t decide.  \n\nIf there are no other significant others invited, then why would Joe be the exception?\n\nBut also, it\u2019s kind of weird that you have to meet her first. Why do you need to vet her? Are you worried she\u2019s going to cause a disturbance?  Do you not trust Joe to bring a respectful date?", "NTA. \n\nCan you think of any reason why your husband is being weird about dying on this hill? It's kinda expected that if two people haven't been together that long then the significant other shouldn't be invited to a wedding/intimate gathering.", "INFO: is it a financial or space issue? Or feeling like most of the guests are on his side and you don't want to be more outnumbered? If it is one of those issues, focus on the root cause, not how well you know her. \n\nOtherwise, I would say very gently YTA. Not allowing plus ones for friends' relatively new significant others who weren't part of the friends group was one way we dealt with a limited venue capacity for our indoor winter wedding...but it's one of my regrets. It wouldn't have inflated the numbers highly, and having been to more weddings, I now realize how out of the norm and unwelcoming it is to the original friend. I thought the exact same thing as you when I got married in my 20s, but if I could have a redo, I would choose differently.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Logan's partner is also your friend, on her own, even though you met her via Logan. She gets invited for that reason.  joes girlfriend is not your friend so she isn't invited  The invitation list has already been decided and there's no reason to change it based on the chance she will be around long term and become a friend.  Esp since Joe already expects to come alone.  \n\nI agree the real problem is your fiance's tantrum about it.", "NTA. I get your reasoning and you made a totally fair compromise by meeting her before. What's not OK though, if your fiance being manipulative by saying that he just won't invite his friend at all. This is extremely immature.", "Yea he was also saying maybe Logan\u2019s gf shouldn\u2019t come either if Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t.

Also i don\u2019t really care how many friends he invites compared to me. It\u2019s more about the closeness of those invited than the quantity.

It\u2019s not about not trusting Joe at all", "He says that if Joe really likes this girl he would feel bad having to say she can\u2019t come. I think he\u2019s trying to protect his friend\u2019s feelings", "More of a financial issue. I also have to add we will have a bigger ceremony with plus ones and everything in a year or 2 more where everyone is invited.

You\u2019re still NTA and it\u2019s odd that Tom is pushing it so hard. A long term gf (logan\u2019s) is not the same as a month long one. And his saying that you won\u2019t have time to meet her before the wedding\u2026could be valid but idk. The respectful thing to do would be to meet your conditions. \n\nSome people will probably say it doesn\u2019t matter that you haven\u2019t met her, a close friends gf automatically gets a pass to come. Maybe at a large reception (though not necessarily). But as someone with a family history of alcoholism and narcissism, you can\u2019t underestimate the capacity of one person to ruin a celebration. She\u2019s *probably* fine\u2026but Tom not respecting you is the larger issue here.\n\nEDIT: changed word", "NTA. OP maybe now isn't the right time to get married. Your fiance response was on the childish side. You offered a compromise of trying to met this person first to get to know them and he said no. Instead he said he won't invite his friend.
