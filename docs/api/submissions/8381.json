You should expect some privacy and to be able to drink a glass of wine or cook food in the home you're paying to live in.\n\nSome people aren't reasonable, though. Be prepared to ask for privacy and not get it. So maybe it's time to look into moving out.", "NTA. You're not living under their roof, you're renting a portion of their house. Whether you drink wine in the premises you're paying for is none of their business, and you have every right to cook in your own home. Sounds like they have some major boundary issues. It's really creepy that they're going into your private areas without your permission. In your shoes I would move out.", "NTA, you are renting from them. They need to not walk in unannounced.  So what if you have wine?  Y'all are adults.  You probably need to start looking at moving out though.  They sound like they don't believe in boundaries.", "You're in a rental relationship with a property owner. That the property owner is also family is irrelevant - they have a legal obligation to respect your rights as rentors.\n\nYou are NTA, but they sure are, and you're definitely being reasonable to require them to respect your private space. Once they rented it to you they lost the ability to claim it as their own.", "NTA, do the adult thing and have an adult conversation with them about some boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nPaying rent for a place to live is an even exchange, they're not doing you a favour, you're not doing them a favour, nobody owes the other party anything. \n\nSo now that's established, they're pushing boundaries and telling you how to live your life, invading your privacy and getting mad at you? Major AH vibes here.", "NTA, can you lock the door?  You are a paying tenant, not guests in their home.  They have absolutely no right come barging in like that, or go through your refrigerator.  You guys should seriously discuss this and see if you all can't come to an understanding..... Or you could just walk around naked all the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You really should consider moving out if they make a big deal out of your request for boundaries.", "INFO: why can\u2019t you lock your doors?", "You hid one reasonable thing amidst the unreasonable things there.   ESH\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for your in-laws to expect you not to smoke in their property.   That causes actual damage to the property, to the walls and ceilings and soft furnishings.   Are you at least smoking outdoors?   \n\nIf you\u2019re smoking indoors, it weakens your position to ask for privacy on the other matters.   Wine, candles, and cooking are all perfectly normal things for adults to have and do in their rented home.    You can (and should) enforce boundaries over these, but be aware that smoking is a real issue and you absolutely can get evicted over it.", "NTA\n Get a new lock. You're paying rent, they cannot enter without permission", "NTA. \n\nDon\u2019t smoke in the house. \n\nMove out as soon as possible. \n\nYou can \u201cwin\u201d the battle that you have rights as a renter, but carefully chose your battles so you don\u2019t lose the \u201cwar\u201d, which is a lifelong happy marriage with your partner. Try to keep the peace as much as is humanly possible, practice good communication with your spouse, and please for the sake of your marriage move out ASAP.", "FYI stop the smoking on their propriety if they have told you they dont want you to do that.   \nThe rest though they need to knock, not go through your fridge etc.\n\nESH because both sides are doing things they shouldn't.", "NTA.  You are paying rent.  You have every right to expect them to respect your boundaries like a normal tenant/landlord relationship.", "NTA. But I'd say the amount of rent might make a slight difference. If you're paying full market rate or even close then totally NTA, and you could just move out and find a place to rent for the same money elsewhere. If they're giving you a huge discount on what it would cost to rent elsewhere then it does blur slightly into a gray area. I'd still say they should respect your privacy and your space. But recognise that the price for enforcing those boundaries could be having to find somewhere else to live and paying a lot more.", "Don't smoke in their house.  For the rest I'll say NTA", "NTA.  No, your feelings are completely normal but the best solution is to move out.  Trying to establish boundaries with the in-laws whilst living with them is very, very difficult and could severely strain the relationship.", "Nta you're paying rent you're entitled to the same boundaries", "NTA. Easy fix. - make a nice meal, light a candle, pour a couple glasses of wine, get naked and sit down for naked dinner and wait for your uninvited guests to bust in.", "NTA. If you are paying rent, you have renters rights. Write up a contract detailing the boundaries. There are lots of templates online.", "NTA. Change the locks... They should NOT be letting themselves into your home.", "NTA but do you have a lease? Because having a lease protects you and them. It also states that they cannot enter the property without 24 hr notice. By getting a lease, you are going to be able to set boundaries easier.", "NTA. You are tenants, they need to treat you as such. Most places require 24 hours notice for landlords to enter your space. I understand they're his parents, and that can be a little different, but they need to knock, and should never enter your space when you're not there unless it's an emergency.", "NTA. However, this situation is not likely to improve unless you move out. Start preparing now.", "Even if they are not paying rent, they are controlling them. She can't burn a candle or accidentaly burn food? They can't drink? They don't even get courtesy of a knock before they come in?", "You can get these handy locks, door jams and alarms set for traveling in hotel rooms. Both allow for privacy+parents cant complain about any damages.", "Trust me we are saving up to get out of here ASAP!! Slowly but surely.", "I would never smoke inside!! I normally go out for a walk but if they saw me even if I\u2019m somewhere random I\u2019m public or whatever they\u2019d get mad.", "OP isn't. She is talking about them seeing her smoking outside during a walk.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.. these people will be in my life for decades to come I can\u2019t just demand renters rights all of a sudden like people are suggesting. If we did they\u2019d just tell us to get out and get our own house. They\u2019ve already threatened us after seeing wine!", "Lmao that could work \ud83e\udd23", "Unfortunately this house\u2019s laundry room is only accessible to them via the hallway inside our \u201capartment\u201d so we can\u2019t do that", "It\u2019s not a legally rentable space so we can\u2019t really have a proper lease for that reason. I\u2019ve also seen lots of people giving similar advice but these people are my in-laws so I have to be really careful about how I approach this\u2026 and tbh they\u2019re doing us a favor by not charging us a lot to be here\u2026 but in exchange for their generosity they feel they\u2019re entitled to control us \ud83d\ude2d", "The drinking might be an age thing. If this is America, she may not be of drinking age.", "Can relate!  I had a parent just like that... They acted like it was a personal offense against them if they even heard I was seen smoking.  Eventually I just had to distance myself.", "Not that it really matters, but do you smoke weed or tobacco? I always feel like cigarette smoke sticks to your clothes more than the weed smell does, regardless if you smoke outside or not.", "so she says. and  funny it wasn't in her post.", "That\u2019s not accurate. You can have a lease for any space, I could rent out a bedroom in my house and have a lease. It guarantees you a lot including rent, and privacy. Being your in-laws doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have boundaries. If you don\u2019t learn to set them now, your going to have a hard setting them later.", "She is 24", "Ages in the title. They're 23 and 24", "Weed only and only at night before I sleep. I take extra caution to avoid them after I smoke bc of smell tho", "They are smelling candles burning and entering when they aren't invited, even checking their fridge for drinks. Do you really think they wouldn't smell this kind of smoke?", "Oh okay. And that makes sense too, to avoid them, especially if they're shocked by a bottle of wine in your fridge when you're both legally allowed to drink. I've noticed when my bf smokes a joint that the smell lingers a while on his clothes, but it's not nearly as bad as when he vapes with a thc cart. (I just take edibles occasionally, so no judgement towards you or my bf lol). \n\nRegardless, NTA.", "We live in a recreational state so it\u2019s 100% legal btw! It\u2019s just his parents don\u2019t like drinking or smoking so I feel forced to live by their standards. We would\u2019ve already moved if we could afford it. The only reason we\u2019re still here is because we can\u2019t afford to rent anywhere else without moving out of state \ud83d\ude2d", "Oh okay I was wondering if you lived in a state where it was legal or not, but either way I don't see a problem with it. Your body, your choice etc. I hope soon you guys are in a better financial position to move away from his parents! It makes me feel very grateful that my boyfriend's parents are cool with him and his siblings smoking weed as long as it's outside or in the garage.", "NTA but I'd look into an alternative living arrangement if it doesn't change, or install a keypad so you can give a code in emergency but otherwise have privacy.", "NTA. They have an issue with you being adults? *They* are the issue.", "NTA put a lock on the door that will solve the problems when they say something, because I\u2019m sure they will, let them know you are tenants and it\u2019s against the law for them to walk into your apartment without at least a 24 hour notice. If they have a issue you two don\u2019t really have the luxury of taking your time to move start saving aggressively to get out of their house.", "You should really sit down with hubby and write out a list of requirements you have for boundaries.\n\nThen sit down with his parents and set this up as a normal renter's agreement would be.\n\nYou need to be treated as renters. They're accepting payment but trying to treat you like children. They can't have both.\n\nNTA.", "They need to get a lock for whatever door separates their apartment from the rest of the house.", "I mean the people who own the house do probably have a key.", "Then it's none of their business"]}
