Nothing really changed after that, and Steve told me he was exhausted from trying to get his wife to be intimate again. He really did lover her, so divorce over sex wasn't really an option. He wanted it to work, so he stopped pursuing her sexually, knowing that's what she wanted. Anyways, fast forward a couple years, and Steve started going to those Asian massage parlors where you can pay for \"services\". Cindy found out, came over one night crying like crazy. She was so upset, hurt, and didn't want to accept that he would do something like this behind her back. I told her that Steve had talked to me about what was going on, and she demanded I tell her what I knew. I told her that Steve complained to me about their lack of sex a while back, and that he was still in love so he was going to try and make it work. But, it's hard when you're married to someone who doesn't care about your physical needs, so what did she expect? She got pissed, yelled at me, and left. My wife kind of just looked at me with a glare..however, keep in mind that we are all really good friends so being blunt and honest about anything and everything is never an issue with us...

And in the end, they're probably going to get divorced over sex anyway because he cheated.  \n\nDo I blame Steve for not wanting to be in a sexless marriage?  No. But he CHOSE TO BE IN ONE, so he needs to own that choice instead of stepping out on his partner.  His wife was very clear about not wanting sex anymore, and at that time, Steve had choices: he could choose to remain in a sexless marriage, discuss his needs with his wife and see if there was a way for him to have his physical needs met and remain in the marriage, OR leave the marriage and find one that fulfilled his physical needs.  And at any time if Steve regretted his choice, he still had the options of discussing his physical needs with his wife and trying to come to an agreement within the marriage about how those should be addressed OR ending the marriage so he could find a physically fulfilling relationship.\n\nStop acting like Steve's only option was to cheat.  It never was.  He chose to remain in a sexless marriage knowing what it was.  And then he chose to cheat.", "YTA There is literally no reason to cheat on someone you claim to love and respect. That is so hateful. He broke trust, commitment, and any goodwill. Because he wanted to get off and couldn't leave his wife before he got off with someone else. He can't love her if he did this to her. He should have just left.\n\nETA: if I was your wife, I'd do more than glare tbh, I'd question your integrity entirely. I wouldn't be surprised if she sits you down for a discussion or asks for couples therapy. you should be prepared for that.", "YTA she\u2019s not to blame, he still is. If he got to the point that he felt sex workers were the answer - he needed to sit his wife down and explain that.", "YTA. I get that Steve is your friend, and I kinda get that you were trying to give a perspective on things that happened. However, I think Cindy just needed compassion at this time. Sometimes all you have to do listen and empathise. There's a time and place for offering a perspective, and this wasn't it.", "YTA. You don't know what's going on in their marriage. You only got one side of the story.", "Steve shouldn\u2019t have cheated; if one has reached the point of seeking out sex workers, it\u2019s time for the marriage to be dissolved. There really isn\u2019t any coming back from that and it\u2019s an asshole move.\n\nNo, Cindy shouldn\u2019t be surprised; I\u2019m not sure why she would think that someone would be okay with a sexless marriage and she\u2019s an asshole for not caring about this person who has supposedly hurt her so deeply.\n\nBut man, the whole \u201cwhat did you expect\u201d thing was really out of place and it bears remembering that you don\u2019t have the entire story. YTA too. Only one who seems reasonably not an A is your wife.", ">divorce over sex wasn't really an option. \n\nDo you not see how divorce is a likely consequence of paying for sex on the side?\n\nSteve's an AH. Cindy is not. She was clear about how she felt and where things stood.\n\nYou're an AH, too. Steve told you things in confidence that you had no business repeating. And your victim blaming is an AH move.\n\nIf Steve couldn't live without sex, he should have talked that over with his wife before taking action. Failing that, he should have told her what he was doing when he started doing it instead of waiting for her to find out somehow.", "YTA. There is only one person responsible for infidelity: the person who decides to do it. Your friend, if he was suffering that much, could have done the mature thing and talked to her about it to come to some kind of arrangement as opposed to sneaking around behind her back. But, by sneaking, he was guaranteeing that he was going to hurt her.", "YTA. Cindy is to blame for her share of problems in the marriage, but Steve is the only one to blame for cheating. He didn't HAVE to cheat. He said he loves her so divorce over sex isn't an option but betrayal is? What definition of love includes betrayal?\n\nIf he was willing to do something that could destroy his marriage, then he should have divorced her. It was and is an option.\n\nBTW, if this is your attitude towards cheating your spouse needs to start wondering about you.", "Ehhhhh I think YTA your friend came over bc she needed her friends. I think just being there for her in this moment should have been the priority, not asking her what she expected", "Well...\n\nYTA, are you completely right? yes. Should she have seen this coming? absolutely. are you still an asshole for saying it aloud? pretty much.", "YTA.  Stop making excuses for his shitty choices.  He should have either kept up the communication or just ended the relationship.", "ESH for me. \n\n-he should\u2019ve asked her and worked out a solution like an \u201copen marriage\u201d. Definitely don\u2019t do it without consent\n-she can\u2019t expect her husband to go without for the rest of his life\n-OP for bringing it up at the moment and put it too bluntly. I wouldnt say \u201cher fault\u201d either", "\u2018He says divorce over sex isn\u2019t an option\u2019\n\n\nWell I guess it is now, just not sex between the two of them \ud83d\ude02\n\nYTA, regardless of what\u2019s going on, cheating is never okay.", "Nta.  I'm guessing you could have worded it better.", "YTA and so is ur friend. He should\u2019ve had a conversation with his wife and try to resolve the problem; not cheat.", "YTA!", "YTA. One partner desiring sex and the other not does just justify cheating. It means the partner who wants sex needs to either leave or live without it. From Cindy's perspective, he agreed to live without it and then went and betrayed her.\n\nAlso like. You act like you were bestowing some deep insight upon her, but if her husband didn't already try that one on her, then she probably could guess he cheated because she doesn't want to sleep with him, she clearly knows it was an issue for him and it's not hard to make the jump.", "ESH.  Cheating isn't justified when he could just leave.  Apparently sex is important enough for him to cheat, but not leave?  Fuck that.  That makes Steve an asshole.  \n\nYou're an asshole for not recognizing that and blaming it all on her.  Tbh if I were married to you I would be side eyeing you.\n\nShe's an asshole for expecting her husband to be ok with never having sex again.", "YTA \u2014 You heard one side of the story. Their marriage is none of your business. Period. Doesn\u2019t matter how close you are.  So you\u2019ve assumed a lot of things based off of his side of the issues, and then you also respect his infidelity\u2026?  Gross. Stay out of their marriage and cheating is always disgusting. YTA.", "I mean yeah, YTA. His hand is right there if he absolutely *needs* gratification. He's not entitled to it from his wife, and he's not entitled to go get it from someone else whilst hiding it from his wife either. If they'd had a conversation and decided that this was a reasonable solution, sure, but he did not involve her in the decision making process at all. \n\nBut hey, at least you said this in front of your wife so she knows that if she ever doesn't want to have sex with you, she can expect you to immediately cheat on her!", "ESH\n\nWell\u2026 what did she expect? Him to just stay bitter for years and be miserable?\n\nShe refused to work on it and see her husband has needs, he refused to keep talking about it. This marriage is headed for destruction.", "Will be dowvoted to hell, but NTA. Cheating is one of those things that are so awful that it automatically becomes black and white and there is absolutely no room for nuance and complexity. Unfortunately, real life is rarely ever so neat and tidy and tends to be messy. Cindy was deliberately and dismissively damaging her relationship by telling Steve that his needs don't matter at all. That doesn't negate the fact that Steve is still the major AH, but Cindy did play a role in the situation.", "YTA - no, she\u2019s not to blame. At all.\n\nHe knew she wasn\u2019t interested in sex anymore. He could have gotten a divorce. *No one* is obligated to have sex with their partner against their will.\n\nETA: sex drives change over the years. Hormones with birth control, age, pregnancy. If there\u2019s medications that have to be taken. Stress from life. Other problems in their marriage. If it\u2019s gotten to the point where they\u2019re not compatible, then either you accept it or call it a dealbreaker and divorce.", "YTA. No one held a gun to his head and made him walk into those massage parlors. His hands weren't tied. He could stay or leave and he chose to stay. Anything he does outside of that is his responsibility.", "Lol NTA. She can be celibate if she likes, but she can't impose celibacy on her husband.", "YTA. \nCindy clearly communicated that she was not interested in sex anymore. Steve decided he loved her enough to remain in a sexless marriage. He could of left, not over sex exactly but over mismatched needs in the relationship. But he didn\u2019t, he indicated with his actions/choices that he was okay with the type of relationship Cindy wanted. Then he cheated. There is no excuse for cheating. None. \nIf he wanted sex, he was free to leave his wife, or discuss an open marriage idea. Cheating because his wife won\u2019t \u201cput out\u201d is a shitty thing to do and means he doesn\u2019t love her like he claims. \n\nAlso, please realise you may of tanked your own marriage. If my husband said this I would think he\u2019s okay with cheating and would consider cheating. And I would be seriously reconsidering things.", "I bet your wife is definitely sus about you know since you\u2019re basically saying Steve was justified lmao .", "ESH,\n\nThey truly should have discussed their issues and given options on how to fix it. If they couldn't find a reasonable solution, they should have split. She should have taken his concerns seriously, he shouldn't have cheated.\n\nYou should have not got in the middle of those two. That's not something you wanna get in the middle of.", "ESH, Cindy most of all for unilaterally moving the goalposts in the marriage then getting mad when Steve unilaterally moved the goalposts too. He should have told her in advance tho. Boo hoo for her, maybe on her next marriage she can try caring about her partner. Sadly, people like that tend to become bitter and retrench instead of evaluating what they did wrong. The thing is \u2014 marriage only works when you BOTH sacrifice for each other and prioritize the other person. She didn\u2019t do that, so he didn\u2019t either. Sucks to suck.\n\nAnd I say this as a middle aged woman who is often not in the mood, but I love my husband so his pleasure is more important to me.\n\nYou \u2026 were blunt. Correct, but blunt. I\u2019d like to think your wife was only glaring bc of your delivery.", "Steve is TA  for cheating. Cindy is TA for expecting her husband to live in a marriage with no intimacy and refusing his efforts to address the situation with counseling. I'm not going to call you TA for what you said because Cindy was being an idiot to expect this marriage to continue indefinitely under those circumstances without something negative happening. It's the sort of response you make to someone who's surprised when they refuse to put gas in their vehicle tank and then is all upset because it stops running. However, I do urge you to think long and hard about whether you actually approve Steve's method of addressing this problem because if you do think it was an appropriate way to handle the situation, you would be TA.", "NTA, your friend thought she could keep living her life the way she wanted without a care in the world for her husband needs? That's what happens. She only has herself to blame.", "NTA. People don't like hearing hard truths. Should he have left the marriage,  absolutely. She still has some of the blame though.", "Nta. You told the truth", "Yeah, out of line.\n\nSteve had choices, he chose wrong. \n\nIf he doesn't want to divorce, but he still wants sex, then he should have asked Cindy to talk about what options they could compromise on. If they couldn't compromise, then he's back to divorce or no sex. \n\nOh btw, you just told your wife that you think cheating is ok if you're not getting what you want at home. Have fun with that.", "[deleted]", "Nta. These chicks in the comments are wild", "YTA\n\nSteve is the only one responsible for communicating his wants, needs and intentions. If Steve was hiding the fact that he was visiting prostitutes from Cindy then even he knew it was wrong and would hurt her. It is his fault.\n\nI am curious to hear her side though. She said doesn't desire sex and doesn't feel the need to satisfy him. Did it become one sided and sex became only about satisfying him and not her? Was he pressuring her into satisfying him? When sex becomes and uncomfortable job that can make you not desire it at all anymore. I hope she continues with therapy.", "YTA no one is to blame for someone else's infidelity. If she's not making him happy, get a divorce and then get with someone else. Cheating should never be an option.", "ESH. You definitely didn\u2019t have to say it to her face she just wanted a shoulder to cry on. Husband sucks for cheating instead of divorcing. Wife sucks because not caring if your spouse gets satisfied is messed up", "YTA. are you a therapist? marriage counselor? No. \nYou have neither the right nor the ability to determine responsibilities in a relationship in which you only know SHORTLY what a party decided to share with you. \nI don't read the part where she asked you for your opinion, but only where she asked you to tell her what you knew.\n In addition to condoning your friend's infidelity, perhaps that is the reason why your wife looked at you (you knew for some time that he was unfaithful and despite the fact that she is also your friend, you never commented on anything -or gave an opinion to your friend about how he was screwing up the relationship).\nShe's not your friend, nor did he love her; love involves RESPECT. he could always get a divorce if he wasnt sexually satisfied, or did someone force him into a sexless marriage?\"", "YTA, there is never an excuse to cheat. \n\n\nPlus there are lots of reasons a woman could lose her sex drive including hormone changes, Illness, depression, anxiety...all which often have easily solutions. So he threw his marriage away. I hope this opens your wife's eyes to the type of person you are.", "YTA. There is nothing wrong with her. Some people are just not interested in sex but you felt the need to shame her! \n\nWomen don't owe men sex!", "YTA. I\u2019d love to hear Cindy\u2019s side about why their sex life tanked. I\u2019d be shocked if she would really say she just lost interest and couldn\u2019t even begin to guess why.", "YTA. Sometimes you just need to shut the hell up.", "YTA\n\nThere is no excuse for infidelity, clearly if he wasn't being satisfied in his relationship he could of left or had a discussion with his partner about opening the relationship if she had no desire to do these things anymore.  No excuse at all", "NTA. Tough love was appropriate. She said she didn\u2019t care about his needs so he took matters into his own hands. Oh well.", "Lol I hate this country. It reminded me of a Louisiana law that spouses owe a duty to be intimate to each other. If Steve and Cindy lived in Louisiana and Steve hadn\u2019t gone to the massage parlor and just filed for divorce, it\u2019s likely Cindy wouldn\u2019t be able to qualify for final spousal support because a judge would find her at fault for the dissolution of the marriage for not partaking in marital relations. \n\nI don\u2019t believe in \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d There are more ways to be intimate than just penetrative sex. If whatever Steve and Cindy were doing was no longer working for Steve, he should have tried marriage counseling or separating from Cindy rather than cheating.", "YTA.  Yes, you were completely out of line.  This is not your situation to become involved in like this at all.   You achieved nothing.", "I don't think your the AH. She asked, you answered", "You did her a favor", "NTA. It's true.", "Total AH, all you heard was Steve's side of the story on a sexless marriage and counseling.  Was it zero sex, not enough sex to make him happy, was he into kinky sex acts, or just an excuse to step out.  Any which way it was on him.  If he did not feel satisfied and was unhappy he chose to stay.  Now he has to live with what he has done.", "ESH.\n\nIf sex and her partners needs and desires in that realm were not something she cared about, why does it matter that he fulfilled his needs elsewhere, as long as he is a good and loving partner otherwise.\n\nBeing celibate was her choice, and if he didn't want that, but loved her anyway, it sounds like he did the right thing.\n\nHer coming crying over something that was directly caused by her expectations for the relationship, moreso something she was aware of and flat out refused to help, is bizarre to me.\n\nIf the relationship is fine without sex and works, what does she have to he upset about if he is getting it elsewhere? Love and physical intimacy don't go hand in hand by default.", "Cindy drove him away, but Steve's lack of integrity drove him to use the services of potentially sex-trafficked girls/women.\n\nNo one ever needs to cheat when they are free to leave.\n\nSteve should not be deprived of sex, but he should have done what he did.\n\n**Regarding your part in this: NTA. She came to you, and you told her the truth.**", "Brass tacks?  No.  You weren't wrong.  She came to YOUR house and asked YOU questions.  You answered them.   \n\nShe took sex out of the equation early on and refused to compromise.  What exactly did she think was going to happen?  Sex is an integral part of many relationships.  And to take that away for no other reason than you don't want it anymore?  And expect them to accept that and remain celibate too?  That's bound to hurt a partners emotional well-being.\n\nNTA", "NTA we are sex worker positive and healthy relationship positive over here. If he knew she would be betrayed, he should end it.

So the time line is this, Cindy no longer wants to have sex, your mate instead of going to couples therapy or actually having a conversation with her turns to you to vent. He forces her into sex therapy instead and there she confirmed she no longer wanted to have sex, still no one asked her why. You suggested basically side sex, he thinks it an awesome idea and yet no one in this entire time frame want \"hmm why did Cindy not want to have sex\"?

That word is rape.\n\n>fast forward a couple years\n\nYou watched this evolve from Steve trying to force his wife to have sex with him, to Steve giving up and paying for it. There's no sense of disapproval here, not even a hint that you think he made a bad choice.\n\n>what did she expect?\n\nI think she expected her husband to have an adult conversation with her, rather than act like he's so desperate for sex he can't help his own behaviour.

Steve needs to be an adult and have the difficult talk with his wife. Clearly sex is a deal breaker for him, which is fair only people who enjoy a sexless marriage are when both parties have extremely low/nonexistent libido. The cheating isn't her fault in any way unless she made no attempt to communicate her desires before her husband attempted to make it work. That's why your wife is mad at you. In this situation, don't say anything to your friend, last person she wants to see other than her husband is you, so unless she contacts you first asking for an apology, which you should give, don't contact her.", " NTA - He did cheat because she made it clear she would not engage with him sexually.

You\u2019ve said nothing about intimacy, so I\u2019m going to assume he doesn\u2019t even work on that side of things rather just bam I want sex that\u2019s the be all and end all\u2026 which would further cause her to not want sex. \n\nBut as a friend, no matter your opinion, you should have been supportive. She was upset and you rubbed it in her face, that\u2019s not what I\u2019d class as a friend", "YTA for not recognizing that she needed support, not criticism or blame. \n\nHowever, if we take your post at face value, this whole situation could have been avoided on both sides. \n\nSteve took her to a sex therapist, she was uncooperative and instead of sticking with the issue and trying to figure out what is going on, he became passive and allowed it to bubble in him till he acted out. Not an endearing reaction. \n\nOptions they could have explored before it got to this point: \n- solutions for the sudden loss of sexual appetite (stress, hormone changes, medication changes, body insecurity, etc.)\n- compromises that still encouraged intimacy and allowed him to be fulfilled sexually while not pushing her boundaries of actually having sex (physical and emotional connection while he masturbates, couples massages that end in handjobs, purchasing sex toys like fleshlights and her using it on him or him using it while she\u2019s there encouraging him, they could find a sex partner for him and she could stay and be an encouraging partner, etc.)\n- discuss opening the relationship on his side so he can have his needs fulfilled \n\nIt really wasn\u2019t fair of her to expect him to go from having a sexual relationship to not having one for the rest of their partnership and not having any intention to address that with him. Cutting off sex without notice is a big problem as it can cause body image issues, self worth issues, cheating insecurities, and a loss of intimacy if they don\u2019t have much outside of the sexual relationship. \n\nIt also wasn\u2019t fair of him to hide how much it bothered him. That was a disservice to the relationship. He should have been very upfront about it not being okay, that way they could have explored options further when compromise wasn\u2019t working, like divorce.\n\nI do also wonder if she knew it was an issue for him and decided that he could just deal with it. Her lack of intention to address it during treatment does make me lean that way. If so, she should have been kind and ended the relationship herself. It is supremely unkind and unloving to allow your partner to constantly be neglected or struggle while you ignore it. \n\nHe also had an option of changing his mind later and deciding that a lack of sex life was worth divorce once he realized he was at the verge of cheating. \n\nI hope they intend to address the issues and move forward. As horrible as cheating is and as hard as it is to rebuild trust, it\u2019s not impossible if they both are willing to take responsibility and reassess. If not, they should let their partners go find others that fit their needs better.", "I'm going to be contrarian.\n\nNTA\n\nCindy is to blame for the infidelity.

That being said though you only have his side of the story and so you did go off half-cocked without having both of their sides of the story and so perhaps he could have been painting a less than accurate picture of what actually happened and perhaps he was just justifying his cheating to you without actually having put in any effort.\n\nRegarding the relationship from his side: Based on the information we have here (which isn't much) I can relate an understand why he did what he did, but what he did do was a shitty thing and he is a massive asshole for how he went about it. While I agree that he has no right to demand sex from his wife, I do agree that her dismissing his feelings is a problem and so the appropriate thing for him to do would have been to seek counselling and if it didn't get any better than either suggest opening the marriage *to her* (not behind her back, even though this may lead to divorce) or divorce her and find someone more compatible. Doing it behind her back was the wrong play here.\n\nRegarding the relationship from her side: Based on the information we have I do agree with her that she shouldn't be required to have sex if she doesn't want to and forcing the issue is problematic. However in saying that she did sign an agreement (Marriage) and thus far she has unilaterally decided to change the terms of their agreement which is also equally unacceptable and makes her absolutely an asshole. If she woke up one morning and decided she never wanted sex again then she should have suggested to him that they find a way to have his needs met elsewhere (either an open relationship or sex worker) or to work on her issues to get back to how she used to be. However I agree with you that it's a surprised to exactly no one that if you refuse to address someone's needs in a relationship then there is a chance they will go elsewhere (this goes for both men and women).\n\nI think both of them are assholes in their own way and both of them handled the situation poorly and it's on both of them for their stupidity, and I don't know why the messenger has been shot as it's obvious to everyone else that this was something that could have happened, and while blunt, this is something I would expect that good friends would be honest about. It doesn't sound like you're justifying the cheating so I'm really surprised at how many people are calling you an asshole and some are even making suppositions about what *your wife* is thinking which is equally as moronic.\n\nI think the moral of the story is that communication and compromise is key in a relationship of more than 1 person and both of these people failed at that.", "Yes, you are.\n\nYTA.\n\nIf he was unhappy, he should've LEFT.", "YTA, she's not to blame for your friend's cowardice to not be able to address this further.

Lol", "And he knew her decision and stayed anyway. He had the option of leaving when he found out she no longer wants sex, BUT HE CHOOSE TO STAY", "She's not to blame whatsoever. Why can't she be surprised? When someone is saying they love and you won't get a divorce etc but then cheats I would say that's pretty surprising.", "Agreed. Steve shouldn't have cheated, and Cindy should not have expected that sexually starving a marriage (not established or agreed as asexual) wouldn't have consequences on the health, strength, and sustainability of that marriage. Both these things can be true at once.", "Word. These y t a comments are wild. NTA for calling Cindy out on her hypocrisy. Unilaterally deciding you don't care about your partner's needs is also breaking an agreement in the relationship. Cindy was treating her husband poorly and unfairly, and of course that had an impact on his decision to seek an outlet for his needs outside the marriage. I don't really understand how it's cheating when they didn't actually have a sexual relationship. How can you show sexual fidelity if there is no sexual relationship?", "While a sex life isn\u2019t necessary for all relationships, looking at you aces!, if you\u2019ve already established a sex life and then rip it away, you\u2019re asking for issues if you don\u2019t immediately troubleshoot. Body insecurity, cheating concerns, and intimacy outside of sex are all immediate areas that could be impacted. None are excuses for cheating, but there\u2019s a reason that people consider sex to be the glue for marriage.", "No, they\u2019re saying that she should have addressed the issue seriously with him and found compromises that made everyone happy. They could have discussed opening the marriage bed to other sexual partners, being close and intimate while he masturbated, and addressing why she suddenly lost her sex drive. Meds? Hormone changes? Stress? Body insecurity? There were options and she had a responsibility to her partner to try to fix it.", "I don't think that that is what they're saying.\n\nSex apparently isn't something she values or wants in her relationship with her husband and that's fine. She shouldn't have to force herself to touch her husband's dick.\n\nShe has no interest in touching her husband's dick, but now she's hung up about someone else touching his dick?\n\n\"I can't believe you went out and paid to have something done that I actively refuse to do with you and have zero interest in!\"\n\nObviously we only know one side of the story so no one can say anything definitive \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Basically yes and anyone saying otherwise is lying. All these comments are giving his sex needs are priority over everything and she should just do it and as she doesn't she's as asshole. Nobody's even asking why she doesn't want to have sex anymore.", "He might not have been able to leave as well. The US is heavily skewed to make it profitable for women to divorce. She could take him to the cleaners, especially if they have kids.", "Isn't most of the comments here just making a bunch of assumptions? Isn't that what we do here?", "The option isnt to make your partner have sex with against their will though?? She told him what her boundaries were surrounding her own body. He doesnt get to change that, only decide his own actions based on the new information. He could have stayed celibate, discussed opening the relationship, or he could have left. Those are the only acceptable options. He doesnt get to coerce her to have sex to suit his needs. God these comments are disgusting.", "I mean, the fact that she didn't rebut him when he said it kind of indicates that it was the truth. If Steve lied, you think Cindy would be like 'wtf, our bedroom isn't dead.'\n\nStill agree Steve is the asshole. He should have divorced Cindy as he clearly wasn't okay with a sexless marriage (understandable) and Cindy wasn't interested in therapy. Instead, he cheated", "Husband needed to have that conversation before doing so. Communicate or YTA", "All these responses saying Steve should\u2019ve just divorced her if his needs weren\u2019t being met. He still would\u2019ve been the bad guy had he done so (discarding his loyal wife and throwing away his mostly wonderful marriage JUST FOR SEX!) There really weren\u2019t any good options.", "Oh wait, they already did that with a specialist. That conversation didn't turn out great.", "He could\u2019ve, but he didn\u2019t so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nTbh, most people would call time on a relationship/marriage if their partner/spouse asked for an open relationship. Not all, of course, but something tells me this guy wanted to have his cake and eat it - keep wife in the dark and pretend he was fine with not getting any to continue to reap all the other benefits men get from marriages/long term relationships (emotional support, comfort, the majority of the household chores done for him) while getting laid on the side. \n\nHe had many different choices, including talking to his wife. He chose the AH way - cheat behind her back.", "She could've talked to him about their sex life too. It's a two-way street. Neither of them choose to talk to the other about their concerns and issues.", "An \"open\" marriage that they both discussed.", "Imagine that thinking saying this (especially to someone you ostensibly still love and care for) would in anyway be easy", "You'll notice she said that she didn't want to accept he would do this *behind her back.*\n\nIt has nothing to do with being controlling or possessive. \n\nIt has everything to do with a betrayal of trust. \n\nYou wanna change the terms of an agreed upon relationship? Then you need to get everybody on board.", "Dunno, maybe because she expressed she wasn\u2019t interested in it, and he stayed in the marriage/didn\u2019t talk to her about it. It ain\u2019t controlling or possessive to expect your spouse to be faithful if they haven\u2019t expressed that they want to open the relationship, and want to stay married.\n\nPossibly also because you make a whole bunch of vows when you marry someone, and betraying them by paying to have sex with exploited massage parlour girls instead of communicating that you want to have more sex and being upfront and honest (and leaving if the wife wasn\u2019t ok with an open relationship or compromising) is a definite breach of several of em. \n\nAlso if you and your spouse previously had matching libidos and then one party\u2019s changes, there\u2019s probably something going on. Might be exhaustion, maybe a hormonal change, maybe you\u2019ve let yourself go and aren\u2019t attractive to her anymore (though she should probably be honest about that one if it\u2019s the case).", "Well she could love him for years without caring about his needs, he could go somewhere to fulfill his biological needs and love her. \n\nDoesn't seem to unrealistic.\n\nBut he still cheated tho.", "Exactly this. I\u2019ve been with my partner for around 7 years and we definitely go through spells of not being into sex (sometimes at the same time, sometimes not) and neither of us have used that as an excuse to cheat lol.\n\nUnlike Steve and Cindy however (though still not a reason for Steve to cheat), we discussed at length our expectations for our relationship in regards to sex (open relationship as long as neither of us LIE or HIDE IT). \n\nSteve should have sat Cindy down and DISCUSSED this to see if they could come to some sort of agreement and if not, what the next steps would be. Instead, he betrayed Cindy in one of the most painful ways and there is NO EXCUSE for it.", "Or she was depressed. Or had some health issues.", "By this logic, it\u2019s okay for Steve to seek sex outside of his marriage without his wife\u2019s permission or knowledge.", "but is he then really cheating? She removed that part of the relationship so to him the rules are no longer binding, as sex is not part of their marriage. Like if he was going fishing alone because she wasn't interested. I'm not condoning him I just think that could be an argument.", "Does the OP say that Steve is not allowing Cindy to make decisions about her body???\nOr does the post say that that Cindy is attempting to control what Steve does with his body? Cindy can be asexual if she wants, but she doesn\u2019t get to make the decision that Steve must be asexual.", "Because I can see both POV. Not all cheated spouses are blameless.", "Oh, there needed to be more communication. He stopped communicating after he found there was a conflict \u2014he wanted something she wouldn't give him. The next step would've been to talk about what would that imply, to try to find solutions. Her giving in and having sex that she didn't desire wasn't a fair option, and if they didn't want and open marriage (fair) and be didn't want to live without sex (fair too), they should've broken up. Cheating was literally the worst option because it led to the same outcome but hurting her in the process.", "But she didn't say *why*. \n\nBad sex for example is something they could have worked on. Medication could have been something to try another proscription. She just said NO.", "Then OP can lie to and Cindy too.\n\nI don't see why Steve would lie about the sex therapy thing, venting to a friend in private? What reason would he have to lie? He also told him that long before he cheated.", "Yeah, because divorces are so easy. /S\n\nThey're exhausting, expensive, nerve-wracking. \n\nSo getting twice an appointment with a prostitute seems way easier. \n\nSame for Cindy. Shutting everything down was easier for her.", "From what I have heard some people never had much interest in sex and then life (and maybe kids) get in the way and their interest swindles down to zero. I agree it\u2019s naive to think that this would work longterm. If the husband wants regular sex and she wants monogamy, the only real option is divorce.", "Well I guess she still values monogamy. It\u2019s  probably hurtful nonetheless if your partner steps out.\n\nIn any case, he betrayed her, she didn\u2019t, if their marriage was based on monogamy.\n\nWhat I can agree with you is saying she was quite naive for thinking this would work longtime.", "How does she need him to not have sex when they don't have a sexual relationship anymore. That seems weirdly controlling to me.", "Many would argue he was doing her a kindness keeping her in the dark. It's not like his stepping out was a threat to their nesting partnership in any way, or exposing her to the risk of STDs.", "That doesnt make any sense. Shes not going to leave him because shes guessing that hes unhappy, he didnt tell her that it was a deal breaker. They did the sex therapy and when she said she didnt want sex anymore he said ok. If the bedroom situation was working for her and he pretended it was working for him then why would she initiate a separation?", "Throwing away the marriage by cheating is infinitely times worse than throwing away the marriage because his needs are not being met and will not be met indefinitely", "If I was in a monogamous relationship and for whatever reason my sex drive changed and I didn't want to have sex with my partner, and they came to me and wanted to discuss opening up the relationship, I'd be at least open to the discussions, so I could put in reasonable rules in place to make sure everything is safe and reasonable. Steve didn't do that, which makes me think that perhaps the reason Cindy didn't want sex anymore is more likely something Steve did or didn't do than physiological changes from Cindy.", "Wasn\u2019t it also an AH move for the wife to give up on the physical relationship in the marriage? Obviously she can do what feels right to her but it doesn\u2019t seem like this was a marriage Steve went into thinking his wife would ever completely give up on sex. Physical intimacy is a big part of relationships for most people. If Cindy cared about the relationship she could have at least given therapy a serious try. Not that two wrongs make a right, but there is more than one betrayal here.", "You don\u2019t have to be legally divorced before you can start sleeping around, you just gotta say you want one/want to end the relationship. Then you\u2019re not lying/sneaking around, you\u2019re separated.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to get divorced, don\u2019t betray your partner by cheating on them. Saves a lot of time and money to not cheat.", "Does divorce get easier if you do it because one of you cheated?", ">You wanna change the terms of an agreed upon relationship?\n\nThe terms were already changed unilaterally by her tho. Where I'm from if one of the spouses refuses intimacy the marriage is voided without divorce or settlement. Does the us not have this?", "Sure you can have that expectation, but calling it a right is a bit marital-r***y. If your spouse isn\u2019t meeting your expectations, in any way, you can always leave. Using the phrase \u2018rights\u2019 in regards to sex within a marriage is unfortunately reminiscent of some pretty bad stuff that I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t intend. \n\nAnd peoples circumstances/priorities/hormones are going to change over the course of time.. hence the sickness and in health, good times and bad vow.", "Don\u2019t play the men versus women libido thing. Most women want sex too and it\u2019s important.", "Again why would Steve lie? He slept me sex workers lol the man probably wasn\u2019t the most trust worthy.", "He left out some probably key details to why their sex life wasn\u2019t going so well. But the OP took it as bond. People lie all the time.", "He still could have left her and not cheated on her", "And it\u2019s totally understandable that sex drive will change over time! I would hope that couples discuss options well before it ever gets to that. So that when it does, they are prepared.", "Ew. Lack of communication is not a \u201ckindness\u201d. If you\u2019re not monogamous, be straight up about it or leave, otherwise YTA", "I would argue that it was obvious it wasn\u2019t working for him, which is why they went to therapy for it. She knew he was unhappy about it and didn\u2019t care to fix it. She holds some responsibility in their relationship, but not in the act of cheating, that was all him. If I were her and knew my mate was so unhappy and knew there was zero chance of me fulfilling that, I\u2019d be looking for alternatives or divorcing him so he could find someone that will. It\u2019d be the kind thing to do.", "The okay was likely that breaking point of fuck it.", "You\u2019re missing the fairly common reason which is that some women don\u2019t think Sex is important. \n\nThey genuinely believe that because it doesn\u2019t much matter to them, it is not allowed to be important to their husbands. \n\nFor them, it\u2019s like giving up roller skating - an activity they did during their young adult years as a result of peer pressure. They won\u2019t miss it & their lives won\u2019t change because of it. \n\nIt\u2019s why she went to the sex therapist & openly said she didn\u2019t care enough to fix it. \n\nThat kind of woman would be horrified at the thought of opening up the relationship. \n\nBecause Sex doesn\u2019t matter to ME, so YOU just don\u2019t need it. \n\nIt\u2019s mind blowing, but genuinely a fairly common belief.

Isn't possible that Cindy's sex drive is gone or she isn't attracted to Steve?", "Doesn\u2019t have to be anything in particular. Idk how old Cindy and Steve are, but sometimes you just get tired of having sex with someone. And this happens to women in long term relationships at least as often as men. Great book called Mating in Captivity by Esther Perel. She gives some good advice for this sort of thing.", "Depends on how vengeful the other person may be, because then they can have their lawyer make the case that you were already cheating and due to the timing, it would be suspect to interest", "No, the US does not have this as far as I'm aware. \nAnd tbh, that seems suuuuper open to instances of marital rape. \n\nSteve definitely still had the option to divorce tho. His wife was open with him, she told him how she wanted the terms to change. He chose to stay in the marriage, which means he agreed through his to changing the terms. \n\nHe did *not* reciprocate in communicating how he wanted the terms to change, he was not open, and he absolutely lied and broke trust.", "No. She really doesn't. None of her (described) actions prevented Steve from talking about his issues to her, or from finding a mutually agreed upon solution. Hell, that solution may have ended up being agreeing that Steve could go outside the marriage for sex. \n\nInstead, he lied and cheated and broke trust. That's alllll on him", "This has nothing to do with it. It's just your assumption. The sex therapy thing was *before* he was going to prostitutes. So, why would he lie?", "Then Cindy maybe just accused him and OP is a 14y old making up a story. /S", "She could have done the same thing.
