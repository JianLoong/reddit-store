Nothing really changed after that, and Steve told me he was exhausted from trying to get his wife to be intimate again. He really did lover her, so divorce over sex wasn't really an option. He wanted it to work, so he stopped pursuing her sexually, knowing that's what she wanted. Anyways, fast forward a couple years, and Steve started going to those Asian massage parlors where you can pay for \"services\". Cindy found out, came over one night crying like crazy. She was so upset, hurt, and didn't want to accept that he would do something like this behind her back. I told her that Steve had talked to me about what was going on, and she demanded I tell her what I knew. I told her that Steve complained to me about their lack of sex a while back, and that he was still in love so he was going to try and make it work. But, it's hard when you're married to someone who doesn't care about your physical needs, so what did she expect? She got pissed, yelled at me, and left. My wife kind of just looked at me with a glare..however, keep in mind that we are all really good friends so being blunt and honest about anything and everything is never an issue with us...

And in the end, they're probably going to get divorced over sex anyway because he cheated.  \n\nDo I blame Steve for not wanting to be in a sexless marriage?  No. But he CHOSE TO BE IN ONE, so he needs to own that choice instead of stepping out on his partner.  His wife was very clear about not wanting sex anymore, and at that time, Steve had choices: he could choose to remain in a sexless marriage, discuss his needs with his wife and see if there was a way for him to have his physical needs met and remain in the marriage, OR leave the marriage and find one that fulfilled his physical needs.  And at any time if Steve regretted his choice, he still had the options of discussing his physical needs with his wife and trying to come to an agreement within the marriage about how those should be addressed OR ending the marriage so he could find a physically fulfilling relationship.\n\nStop acting like Steve's only option was to cheat.  It never was.  He chose to remain in a sexless marriage knowing what it was.  And then he chose to cheat.", "YTA There is literally no reason to cheat on someone you claim to love and respect. That is so hateful. He broke trust, commitment, and any goodwill. Because he wanted to get off and couldn't leave his wife before he got off with someone else. He can't love her if he did this to her. He should have just left.\n\nETA: if I was your wife, I'd do more than glare tbh, I'd question your integrity entirely. I wouldn't be surprised if she sits you down for a discussion or asks for couples therapy. you should be prepared for that.", "YTA she\u2019s not to blame, he still is. If he got to the point that he felt sex workers were the answer - he needed to sit his wife down and explain that.", "YTA. I get that Steve is your friend, and I kinda get that you were trying to give a perspective on things that happened. However, I think Cindy just needed compassion at this time. Sometimes all you have to do listen and empathise. There's a time and place for offering a perspective, and this wasn't it.", "YTA. You don't know what's going on in their marriage. You only got one side of the story.", "Steve shouldn\u2019t have cheated; if one has reached the point of seeking out sex workers, it\u2019s time for the marriage to be dissolved. There really isn\u2019t any coming back from that and it\u2019s an asshole move.\n\nNo, Cindy shouldn\u2019t be surprised; I\u2019m not sure why she would think that someone would be okay with a sexless marriage and she\u2019s an asshole for not caring about this person who has supposedly hurt her so deeply.\n\nBut man, the whole \u201cwhat did you expect\u201d thing was really out of place and it bears remembering that you don\u2019t have the entire story. YTA too. Only one who seems reasonably not an A is your wife.", ">divorce over sex wasn't really an option. \n\nDo you not see how divorce is a likely consequence of paying for sex on the side?\n\nSteve's an AH. Cindy is not. She was clear about how she felt and where things stood.\n\nYou're an AH, too. Steve told you things in confidence that you had no business repeating. And your victim blaming is an AH move.\n\nIf Steve couldn't live without sex, he should have talked that over with his wife before taking action. Failing that, he should have told her what he was doing when he started doing it instead of waiting for her to find out somehow.", "YTA. There is only one person responsible for infidelity: the person who decides to do it. Your friend, if he was suffering that much, could have done the mature thing and talked to her about it to come to some kind of arrangement as opposed to sneaking around behind her back. But, by sneaking, he was guaranteeing that he was going to hurt her.", "YTA. Cindy is to blame for her share of problems in the marriage, but Steve is the only one to blame for cheating. He didn't HAVE to cheat. He said he loves her so divorce over sex isn't an option but betrayal is? What definition of love includes betrayal?\n\nIf he was willing to do something that could destroy his marriage, then he should have divorced her. It was and is an option.\n\nBTW, if this is your attitude towards cheating your spouse needs to start wondering about you.", "Ehhhhh I think YTA your friend came over bc she needed her friends. I think just being there for her in this moment should have been the priority, not asking her what she expected", "Well...\n\nYTA, are you completely right? yes. Should she have seen this coming? absolutely. are you still an asshole for saying it aloud? pretty much.", "YTA.  Stop making excuses for his shitty choices.  He should have either kept up the communication or just ended the relationship.", "ESH for me. \n\n-he should\u2019ve asked her and worked out a solution like an \u201copen marriage\u201d. Definitely don\u2019t do it without consent\n-she can\u2019t expect her husband to go without for the rest of his life\n-OP for bringing it up at the moment and put it too bluntly. I wouldnt say \u201cher fault\u201d either", "\u2018He says divorce over sex isn\u2019t an option\u2019\n\n\nWell I guess it is now, just not sex between the two of them \ud83d\ude02\n\nYTA, regardless of what\u2019s going on, cheating is never okay.", "Nta.  I'm guessing you could have worded it better.", "YTA and so is ur friend. He should\u2019ve had a conversation with his wife and try to resolve the problem; not cheat.", "YTA!", "YTA. One partner desiring sex and the other not does just justify cheating. It means the partner who wants sex needs to either leave or live without it. From Cindy's perspective, he agreed to live without it and then went and betrayed her.\n\nAlso like. You act like you were bestowing some deep insight upon her, but if her husband didn't already try that one on her, then she probably could guess he cheated because she doesn't want to sleep with him, she clearly knows it was an issue for him and it's not hard to make the jump.", "ESH.  Cheating isn't justified when he could just leave.  Apparently sex is important enough for him to cheat, but not leave?  Fuck that.  That makes Steve an asshole.  \n\nYou're an asshole for not recognizing that and blaming it all on her.  Tbh if I were married to you I would be side eyeing you.\n\nShe's an asshole for expecting her husband to be ok with never having sex again.", "YTA \u2014 You heard one side of the story. Their marriage is none of your business. Period. Doesn\u2019t matter how close you are.  So you\u2019ve assumed a lot of things based off of his side of the issues, and then you also respect his infidelity\u2026?  Gross. Stay out of their marriage and cheating is always disgusting. YTA.", "I mean yeah, YTA. His hand is right there if he absolutely *needs* gratification. He's not entitled to it from his wife, and he's not entitled to go get it from someone else whilst hiding it from his wife either. If they'd had a conversation and decided that this was a reasonable solution, sure, but he did not involve her in the decision making process at all. \n\nBut hey, at least you said this in front of your wife so she knows that if she ever doesn't want to have sex with you, she can expect you to immediately cheat on her!", "ESH\n\nWell\u2026 what did she expect? Him to just stay bitter for years and be miserable?\n\nShe refused to work on it and see her husband has needs, he refused to keep talking about it. This marriage is headed for destruction.", "Will be dowvoted to hell, but NTA. Cheating is one of those things that are so awful that it automatically becomes black and white and there is absolutely no room for nuance and complexity. Unfortunately, real life is rarely ever so neat and tidy and tends to be messy. Cindy was deliberately and dismissively damaging her relationship by telling Steve that his needs don't matter at all. That doesn't negate the fact that Steve is still the major AH, but Cindy did play a role in the situation.", "YTA - no, she\u2019s not to blame. At all.\n\nHe knew she wasn\u2019t interested in sex anymore. He could have gotten a divorce. *No one* is obligated to have sex with their partner against their will.\n\nETA: sex drives change over the years. Hormones with birth control, age, pregnancy. If there\u2019s medications that have to be taken. Stress from life. Other problems in their marriage. If it\u2019s gotten to the point where they\u2019re not compatible, then either you accept it or call it a dealbreaker and divorce.", "YTA. No one held a gun to his head and made him walk into those massage parlors. His hands weren't tied. He could stay or leave and he chose to stay. Anything he does outside of that is his responsibility.", "Lol NTA. She can be celibate if she likes, but she can't impose celibacy on her husband.", "YTA. \nCindy clearly communicated that she was not interested in sex anymore. Steve decided he loved her enough to remain in a sexless marriage. He could of left, not over sex exactly but over mismatched needs in the relationship. But he didn\u2019t, he indicated with his actions/choices that he was okay with the type of relationship Cindy wanted. Then he cheated. There is no excuse for cheating. None. \nIf he wanted sex, he was free to leave his wife, or discuss an open marriage idea. Cheating because his wife won\u2019t \u201cput out\u201d is a shitty thing to do and means he doesn\u2019t love her like he claims. \n\nAlso, please realise you may of tanked your own marriage. If my husband said this I would think he\u2019s okay with cheating and would consider cheating. And I would be seriously reconsidering things.", "I bet your wife is definitely sus about you know since you\u2019re basically saying Steve was justified lmao .", "ESH,\n\nThey truly should have discussed their issues and given options on how to fix it. If they couldn't find a reasonable solution, they should have split. She should have taken his concerns seriously, he shouldn't have cheated.\n\nYou should have not got in the middle of those two. That's not something you wanna get in the middle of.", "ESH, Cindy most of all for unilaterally moving the goalposts in the marriage then getting mad when Steve unilaterally moved the goalposts too. He should have told her in advance tho. Boo hoo for her, maybe on her next marriage she can try caring about her partner. Sadly, people like that tend to become bitter and retrench instead of evaluating what they did wrong. The thing is \u2014 marriage only works when you BOTH sacrifice for each other and prioritize the other person. She didn\u2019t do that, so he didn\u2019t either. Sucks to suck.\n\nAnd I say this as a middle aged woman who is often not in the mood, but I love my husband so his pleasure is more important to me.\n\nYou \u2026 were blunt. Correct, but blunt. I\u2019d like to think your wife was only glaring bc of your delivery.", "Steve is TA  for cheating. Cindy is TA for expecting her husband to live in a marriage with no intimacy and refusing his efforts to address the situation with counseling. I'm not going to call you TA for what you said because Cindy was being an idiot to expect this marriage to continue indefinitely under those circumstances without something negative happening. It's the sort of response you make to someone who's surprised when they refuse to put gas in their vehicle tank and then is all upset because it stops running. However, I do urge you to think long and hard about whether you actually approve Steve's method of addressing this problem because if you do think it was an appropriate way to handle the situation, you would be TA.", "NTA, your friend thought she could keep living her life the way she wanted without a care in the world for her husband needs? That's what happens. She only has herself to blame.", "NTA. People don't like hearing hard truths. Should he have left the marriage,  absolutely. She still has some of the blame though.", "Nta. You told the truth", "Yeah, out of line.\n\nSteve had choices, he chose wrong. \n\nIf he doesn't want to divorce, but he still wants sex, then he should have asked Cindy to talk about what options they could compromise on. If they couldn't compromise, then he's back to divorce or no sex. \n\nOh btw, you just told your wife that you think cheating is ok if you're not getting what you want at home. Have fun with that.", "[deleted]", "Nta. These chicks in the comments are wild", "YTA\n\nSteve is the only one responsible for communicating his wants, needs and intentions. If Steve was hiding the fact that he was visiting prostitutes from Cindy then even he knew it was wrong and would hurt her. It is his fault.\n\nI am curious to hear her side though. She said doesn't desire sex and doesn't feel the need to satisfy him. Did it become one sided and sex became only about satisfying him and not her? Was he pressuring her into satisfying him? When sex becomes and uncomfortable job that can make you not desire it at all anymore. I hope she continues with therapy.", "YTA no one is to blame for someone else's infidelity. If she's not making him happy, get a divorce and then get with someone else. Cheating should never be an option.", "ESH. You definitely didn\u2019t have to say it to her face she just wanted a shoulder to cry on. Husband sucks for cheating instead of divorcing. Wife sucks because not caring if your spouse gets satisfied is messed up", "YTA. are you a therapist? marriage counselor? No. \nYou have neither the right nor the ability to determine responsibilities in a relationship in which you only know SHORTLY what a party decided to share with you. \nI don't read the part where she asked you for your opinion, but only where she asked you to tell her what you knew.\n In addition to condoning your friend's infidelity, perhaps that is the reason why your wife looked at you (you knew for some time that he was unfaithful and despite the fact that she is also your friend, you never commented on anything -or gave an opinion to your friend about how he was screwing up the relationship).\nShe's not your friend, nor did he love her; love involves RESPECT. he could always get a divorce if he wasnt sexually satisfied, or did someone force him into a sexless marriage?\"", "YTA, there is never an excuse to cheat. \n\n\nPlus there are lots of reasons a woman could lose her sex drive including hormone changes, Illness, depression, anxiety...all which often have easily solutions. So he threw his marriage away. I hope this opens your wife's eyes to the type of person you are.", "YTA. There is nothing wrong with her. Some people are just not interested in sex but you felt the need to shame her! \n\nWomen don't owe men sex!", "YTA. I\u2019d love to hear Cindy\u2019s side about why their sex life tanked. I\u2019d be shocked if she would really say she just lost interest and couldn\u2019t even begin to guess why.", "YTA. Sometimes you just need to shut the hell up.", "YTA\n\nThere is no excuse for infidelity, clearly if he wasn't being satisfied in his relationship he could of left or had a discussion with his partner about opening the relationship if she had no desire to do these things anymore.  No excuse at all", "NTA. Tough love was appropriate. She said she didn\u2019t care about his needs so he took matters into his own hands. Oh well.", "Lol I hate this country. It reminded me of a Louisiana law that spouses owe a duty to be intimate to each other. If Steve and Cindy lived in Louisiana and Steve hadn\u2019t gone to the massage parlor and just filed for divorce, it\u2019s likely Cindy wouldn\u2019t be able to qualify for final spousal support because a judge would find her at fault for the dissolution of the marriage for not partaking in marital relations. \n\nI don\u2019t believe in \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d There are more ways to be intimate than just penetrative sex. If whatever Steve and Cindy were doing was no longer working for Steve, he should have tried marriage counseling or separating from Cindy rather than cheating.", "YTA.  Yes, you were completely out of line.  This is not your situation to become involved in like this at all.   You achieved nothing.", "I don't think your the AH. She asked, you answered", "You did her a favor", "NTA. It's true.", "Total AH, all you heard was Steve's side of the story on a sexless marriage and counseling.  Was it zero sex, not enough sex to make him happy, was he into kinky sex acts, or just an excuse to step out.  Any which way it was on him.  If he did not feel satisfied and was unhappy he chose to stay.  Now he has to live with what he has done.", "ESH.\n\nIf sex and her partners needs and desires in that realm were not something she cared about, why does it matter that he fulfilled his needs elsewhere, as long as he is a good and loving partner otherwise.\n\nBeing celibate was her choice, and if he didn't want that, but loved her anyway, it sounds like he did the right thing.\n\nHer coming crying over something that was directly caused by her expectations for the relationship, moreso something she was aware of and flat out refused to help, is bizarre to me.\n\nIf the relationship is fine without sex and works, what does she have to he upset about if he is getting it elsewhere? Love and physical intimacy don't go hand in hand by default.", "Cindy drove him away, but Steve's lack of integrity drove him to use the services of potentially sex-trafficked girls/women.\n\nNo one ever needs to cheat when they are free to leave.\n\nSteve should not be deprived of sex, but he should have done what he did.\n\n**Regarding your part in this: NTA. She came to you, and you told her the truth.**", "Brass tacks?  No.  You weren't wrong.  She came to YOUR house and asked YOU questions.  You answered them.   \n\nShe took sex out of the equation early on and refused to compromise.  What exactly did she think was going to happen?  Sex is an integral part of many relationships.  And to take that away for no other reason than you don't want it anymore?  And expect them to accept that and remain celibate too?  That's bound to hurt a partners emotional well-being.\n\nNTA", "NTA we are sex worker positive and healthy relationship positive over here. If he knew she would be betrayed, he should end it.

If you don't leave and instead willingly choose to cheat, you're automatically an asshole.", "Why give cuddles to your spouse when you can hug a Teddy?\n\nWhy speak to them when you have friends and Reddit? \n\nWhy eat together when you have public restaurants?\n\nBecause your supposed to care for each other. \n\nHe shouldn't have cheated, AH move. But OP is right, what did she expect?", "Hey, do you know them and their finances on a personal level or why do you assume, she doesn't have more money than him or that he didn't only stay in the sexless marriage so he could live in her mansion?!", "Nobody said that, but she just dismissed Steve\u2019s needs", "Yes you summed it up perfectly.", "This is what I am wondering. If this was a problem that emerged during the marriage, rather than being there from the start, you have to wonder what Steve's done (or isn't doing) which has turned Cindy off. I'm reminded of all those reddit posts where the man is essentially an extra child in the household. Not attractive.", "never said it was easy, but if your husband/ wife is ok with you not getting s x, and you really want it, you talk it out amor you leave. Its not like your partner, who was denying you for years of intimacy, will change at the mention of separation.", "Yep, OP keeps going on about how Cindy doesn't care about Steve's physical needs, but we've only got the side of the story from a cheater who only seems to care about his own feelings. Given that Steve's reaction to not getting sex from his wife was to go to sex workers behind her back, there seems to be a good chance that the reason Cindy doesn't want to have sex with him is that sex for him is all about his physical needs, and Cindy's enjoyment doesn't matter to him.", "NTA. People don't like hearing hard truths. Should he have left the marriage, absolutely. She still has some of the blame though.", "Or relationship causes - if it's only *her* going to therapy, that might not come close to the problem", "Yeah, there are lots and lots of reasons that Cindy may not want to have sex with Steve anymore - from the sounds of it Steve didn't really care that much about why, just that it's affecting his life so he used that as an excuse to cheat. Knowing Steve is a cheater doesn't fill me with hope that he cares enough about the potential physical or psychological causes and actually looked into that.\n\n>Steve told me he was exhausted from trying to get his wife to be intimate again\n\nGross, what's the chance sex with Steve is actually enjoyable?", "Yes, he can decide if he wants to have sex with other people. We've never said that he doesn't have the choice to do so. It's a choice he can exercise, but that doesn't mean it's the correct or moral one. \n\nIt also doesn't mean his decisions don't come with consequences that he was to own and deal with. Ironically enough, he wouldn't divorce as a consequence of Cindy not wanting sex. But he's about to get a divorce as a consequence of his actions.", "But the difference is that he betrayed his wife.\n\nHe could have easily told her - since we aren't having sex, I want to open up our marriage from my side and do this. If you aren't comfortable with it, we'll talk about divorce.\n\nThat should have been Steve making a decision about his body. \n\nInstead he went the cowards way. The dude loved his wife too much to divorce? Bullshit. If he loved he wouldn't have betrayed her.", "Except he made a vow to remain faithful. And kept pretending he kept his vow. That's what CHEATING is.\n\nIf he wanted to have sex... he should've dissolved his vow. Instead he said \"I don't want to divorce you\" and then went on to cheat.\n\nThat's the problem... not him exercising his bodily autonomy.\n\nJesus Christ. How is this such basic concept lost on you?", "No. Because he entered into a marriage promising to be faithful. I very much doubt there was anything about having regular sex in their marriage vows. If he no longer wants to be faithful, then he needs to end the marriage.", "Steve could've literally talked about this with her and asked if a compromise could be going to brothels. He could have been open and communicative about how badly this was affecting him and, with her, come to an agreement on either an alternative way for him to feel fulfilled or on divorce.\n\nGoing behind her back and fucking others without any care for how she'd feel is inexcusable.", "Not outside of the marriage.  You know \" the for better or worse\" part.   You don't get to add outside people to the marriage without a clear conversation and agreement of all parties in the marriage.", "If this was really about Steve's choice, he would have told his wife about his choice. He chose to cheat and keep her in the dark. If this was a situation where Steve had said \"sex is important to me in a relationship, either we have an open relationship and I have sex with sex workers, or we divorce\", that's him making a choice with HIS BODY. He didn't. He's a complete AH and his friend is also an AH for covering for him.", "Except \"massage\" parlors tend to be pretty illegal. So... Yes, but actually no.", "But he could get upset. He could divorce. By no means her unilateral decision over her body means that she would not face any consequences.\nWhen he does his own unilateral decision, the same applies. I'm a bit less sympathetic of his choice because they were in a monogamous relationship and there were lies and deception. I would totally support him divorcing, though.", "\"That doesn't make it right\"?! WHAT right? How is she wrong to make the choice that SHE doesn't want to have sex using HER BODY? Who the hell are you to say that her choosing not to have sex with her partner is \"wrong\"?\n\nOf course Steve can make that choice, but in doing so he chose to betray their promise to stay faithful to one another, til death or whatever they vowed. That is the difference.\n\nAgain, they both obviously have different versions of \"love\" and \"partnership\" that they believe in. Cindy obviously believed that her husband would understand and stick by her no matter what, that he loved her for her. Obviously that was not the case here. He should've divorced her instead.", "That's Steve's version of events. We don't know what Cindy's version is.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t get to boot sex out of your marriage and still claim it is sacred to the marriage\u201d - what were you implying here then?", "None of those things is the same thing as letting a person thrust themselves into your body when you are not aroused.", "You can make those assumptions if you want.", "Yep, definitely. Nothing OP has said supports Steve being in any way good at sex or being a husband, so maybe looking at those potential causes of the drop in Cindy's sex drive would have been a better jumping-off point than going to a sex therapist and then sex workers behind her back.", "\u201cBam, super easy\u201d", "What consequence do Cindy\u2019s choices have?  Wouldn\u2019t it be this outcome?", "That makes sense. That's consistent. They both have autonomy and they both face consequences.", "Because they cheat on their partner and are trying to justify it away.", ">Except he made a vow to remain faithful\n\nDid he? Did you read their vows? If they had traditional christian vows she also vowed to obey him, and broke that vow by refusing him sex.\n\n>Jesus Christ. How is this such basic concept lost on you?\n\nSorry to break it to you, but I'm not Jesus Christ. And I KNOW you didn't use the lord's name in vain.", "Depends where you are. Perfectly legal in Australia.", "That if you tell your partner you're not having sex anymore because it's not important (and thus they shouldn't be upset that you're removing sex from the relationship), why would you care if they get sex elsewhere? \n\nIf my partner likes basketball and I don't, and I don't think going to games is important, why would I care if they go watch basketball with their friends, assuming it doesn't interfere with my partner's time and obligations to me? \n\nSex is a little different because he is putting her at risk for disease if they do occasionally get it on. But the principle is the same (and to be clear \"I'm no longer interested in sex ever, it's not an important part of the relationship\" is VERY different from a dry spell, recovery from birth, depression, etc, where the person is still interested in having sex again but is not capable of having it now.)", "Exactly that.\n\n>she no longer desires sex and doesn't feel the need to satisfy him\n\nAnd they went to counseling and she still felt that way. That's booting sex out of the marriage.", "I would be happy enough if you stated your assumptions as that and not some \"fact\"", "Funny how you\u2019re the one assuming she doesn\u2019t work and bring in money.", "yeah, the conversation is easy. once you've had the conversation, you're no longer sneaking around.", "easier than cheating and ruining your relationship\n, yeah, its bam, super easy compared to that.", "I mean they could've talked about a way to compromise what they both want out of this relationship-- he could've seen if Cindy would be open to an open or poly relationship. If not they could've ended their marriage amicably. Steve was not forced to cheat, he made a choice to.", "No, her consequences could have easily been him leaving. He would have been entirely in his right to leave her instead of staying in a sexless marriage. He chose to stay, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s allowed to cheat.", "There's nothing wrong with getting a divorce because you're not compatible sexually with your partner anymore. No one is saying Steve HAS to stay in a marriage that he's unhappy in.\n\nThis is completely different from cheating. If he wanted to go out and have sex he could have divorced his wife and done that, or heck, if they want to stay married then ask to be in an open relationship. Going behind her back is the problem.", "No, but what does that matter? It's a \"her body her choice\". Consequences would (should have been) divorce. Difference is she didn't have to get hurt like that.", "Lol no the \"consequence\" to Cindy's choice was NOT this outcome. The consequence of her choice was to discuss it with her husband honestly and to give HIM the choice of what he wanted to do. Was it a great choice? Probably not from his perspective. But at least he had one.\n\nThe husband, however, was not honest and took all of her choices away. He lied and lied and then did whatever he wanted and refused to give her even the minimum respect of an honest conversation. She presented him with choices, he presented her with none.\n\nLet's not put the responsibility of this man's decisions on his wife.", "> Did he?\n\nYes... if he hadn't I presume OP would've said \"They had an open marriage\"\n\n> and broke that vow by refusing him sex.\n\nNice... supporting rape. Good to know the type of asshole you are.\n\n> Sorry to break it to you, but I'm not Jesus Christ. And I KNOW you didn't use the lord's name in vain.\n\nOh my God. By Yahweh. You are not Jesus fucking Christ? Who knew such despicable person would not be divine?\n\nThanks for clearing it up.", "Because in what seems to be a monogamous relationship, it was seemingly not agreed upon that sex outside of the relationship was okay by both parties. If that was the route that the husband thought would be best to avoid divorce, then he could have broached that subject. Instead, he decided to do that behind her back - thus interfering on what I imagine is one of their obligations to each other. If they couldn\u2019t come to the agreement to allow extramarital sex, and she\u2019s not interested in having sex, then they both can come to the conclusion that they are no longer compatible. Extramarital sex in a monogamous relationship is quite obviously not equivalent to mismatched sporting interests.", "Are you always this insufferable? Or only when trying to cherry pick what religious views fit your current argument?", "Funny how you're all traditional on what his behavior should be, and much more enlightened about her autonomy.\n\nI love the bit where you refer to your hypocrisy as me supporting rape.\n\nI bet they'll work it out.

After all, with Satan, anything is possible.", "I mean, sure, but if your partner is telling you sex is *not important* then why is it so important that you no longer have it with someone else? Extramarital sex isn't equivalent to sports because typically both people regard sex as important in and to the relationship. But if one person says that sex is no longer important to them, I honestly have had a much harder time seeing how it's so different than mismatched sporting interests. Can you give me a reason that it would be, that doesn't boil down to \"sex is important to me\"? \n\nHonestly, in principle, yes, I agree with you - he should have left before cheating. In practice - if they had a good marriage otherwise, if they were compatible in all other aspects, if they had built a life together before the terms of the relationship change, if she was clear that sex wasn't important to her (and it sounded like ethical non-monogamy wasn't a conversation she was interested in)... it's a more complex situation and I lean more towards ESH.", "It was also \u2018seemingly\u2019 agreed upon that they weren\u2019t going to have an asexual marriage too.

You're so much fun.", "To me, it really comes down to communication. She communicated that she was no longer interested in sex, agreed to go to a sex counsellor, but ultimately was not able to move past her aversion. He then has the opportunity to communicate what he needs to move forward - whether that looks like other forms of intimacy together, extramarital sex, or a divorce.
