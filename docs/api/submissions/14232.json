{"id": 14232, "submission_id": "12eods9", "title": "AITA for not telling my daughter I'm proud of her, but being proud of my son?", "selftext": "My (f48) children Leah (f26) and Kevin (m21) are complete opposites. Kevin is a great student, and a great athlete, has goals and works hard for them. Leah is the kind to have big goals too but gives up very easily. Both of our children have had the same opportunities growing up and neither has had to help or work more than the other did. \n\nLeah had tried many activities during her life, the problem is that if she's not excellent at it right away then she gets frustrated and gives up. This is a pattern in her life. Kevin, on the other hand, has always been into sports, he played football through school, and he also plays baseball, basketball, and soccer. He's also better at school than she is, I think part of that is because he had to keep up his grades if he wanted to continue in the school team. Leah didn't have a reason to have great grades so although she never failed a class either, her grades had always been lower than Kevin's. After graduating Leah wasn't interested in pursuing further education, still as it would make my husband and I happy that she would at least try it, she did. She wasn't able to finish her second semester because she didn't like it. She got into a job after that which is fine if she liked that. She and her boyfriend (they had been together since high school) got engaged that same year too and Leah told us she wanted to be a mom, she felt like that was her call. She was very young, but I was too when I had her so it's fine. She got pregnant, but she and the guy broke off, she couldn't take care of her baby so my husband and I are raising our grandson. Now she's 26 and the truth is she hasn't fulfilled any of her wishes or goals. She doesn't have a career, is not married, and is not a mother (she does nothing of the care and doesn't live with us)\n\nKevin won a scholarship because he's an athlete. Now he's studying at a prestigious university and is part of his college's football team too. He's fulfilling his dreams because he's working on them. \n\nLast week was Kevin's birthday, our baby turned 21 so my husband and I planned a small party for him. We were all having a good time, Kevin was telling us about how good his grades were this last semester. I told him we were very proud of him for working so hard. Leah told me I had never told her that I was proud of her, I told her this was not the moment to talk about that because this party was for her brother and she dropped it. \n\nHowever, she brought it up again the next day at my house. She asked me why I never told her I'm proud of her, so I told her that I don't feel like she has done something to be proud of. Like I'm proud that she's a nice girl and very respectful, but she still hasn't done something to fulfill her dreams and make us proud. \nShe went off on me and accused me of telling her she's a failure although I did not do that. She was very angry and left. \nMy husband agrees with me but she's angry, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680880184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12eods9/aita_for_not_telling_my_daughter_im_proud_of_her/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you know...sometimes it can be a really different story than expected...\n\nI was not wrong in my first assumption, OP definitely TA.\n\nYou seriously told your kid you've never once told her you're proud of because she had nothing to be proud of?\n\nSo you're saying from the time she was born not one thing she ever did was worth saying you were proud of her?  \n\nSo she went from ages: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, and not once you said \"I'm proud of you\"?\n\nAt what point do you think she just gave up on her self confidence with a parent as cold hearted as you?   \n\nYou definitely have a golden child, and she has been discarded as irrelevant.\n\nYou know the funny thing... the Golden Child is usually trying to live up to your standards, he's most likely living his life for you, not for himself.  Eventually those golden children burn out bright and fast, and your daughter if ever she received the right attention from a considerate parent could have bloomed later on in life, but since she wasn't living up to your expectations when she was younger... nothing worth encouraging here.... so so sad for her.\n\nShe needs to find a loving partner who actually can \"lift her up in life\" and start a family far from your judgment.", "ESH. It doesn\u2019t sound like you ever supported your daughter the way she needed. You claim you treated your kids \u2018equally\u2019\u2014which we can all here tell is bull-ony\u2014but what you should\u2019ve done is support your daughter in the way she *needed.*\n\nOn the other hand she\u2019s 26 years old, and you\u2019re raising her daughter for her because she can\u2019t get her act together. It\u2019s reasonable for you to have *thoughts* on that. Maybe it\u2019s time for her to stop caring so much about what you think about her, and start focusing on her life so SHE can support her OWN daughter. She should care about making her own daughter proud of her, not you.", "ESH except Kevin.\n\nThis whole post hits a little too close to home. I can hear the subtext coming through the screen. You didn\u2019t say your daughter was lazy and had wasted her potential but you didn\u2019t have to.\n\nWhen I feel those buzzwords my immediate reaction is neurodiversity, specifically ADHD and what would have been labeled ADD when your daughter was a child. However, it could be many other things that often go overlooked in girls and women.\n\nHas she ever seen a therapist? Has anyone ever suggested she needed additional help growing up?\n\nSomeone who\u2019s so unfocused doesn\u2019t want to be. They lack the ability to follow things through.  This is especially hard because they often react to the world differently than most. \n\nThink of it this way: if everyone tells you something is a doorway and all you have to do is walk through it, everyone (including yourself) are going to believe you are lazy and stupid for not walking through. However, once you realize what is a doorway to everyone else is a window to you then things start making more sense. You weren\u2019t lazy or stupid, going through is just a bit harder for you. Once you have the tools you need, even if other people don\u2019t need them, you can go though like everyone else.\n\nAll of that is to say that part of this is your fault for not finding the tools that would motivate your daughter. It would be one thing if she was living a simple but happy life. It\u2019s another for her to still be aimless and clearly struggling and the only helps she\u2019s ever received is the message to get over it.\n\nThe other part of this is that while you may have missed things growing up she is now a grown woman. She now has the power to seek help on her own and change and grow. \n\nHer not having what she needed growing up to make you proud is on you. Her blaming you now for still being stuck is on her.", "I feel like there has got to be missing info here - how and why did you end up raising Leah\u2019s child while she lives elsewhere on her own?  Does she have mental health or addiction troubles?  *She* must think she\u2019s done something you should be proud of, so has she gone through something that makes just being alive and functioning an achievement?", "Yes they had the same opportunities and you say neither of them needed help, but based on what you say alone it seems that Leah needed and still needs help. She probably has some undiagnosed learning disability/ADHD/something and needed you to take her to a therapist as a child to sort things out and help her better manager her time and abilities", ">our baby turned 21\n\nYou mean your golden child?  Did you ever stop to think that one of the reasons Leah may give up so easily is that you've spent her whole life making her feel like it doesn't matter if she does well anyway because, in your mind, she'll never be as good as her brother?  So, why would she bother trying when her efforts are never recognized?  While I think that not taking responsibility for her own child is not a good thing, I also feel like you have brought this on yourself because of how you raised her.  She is who she is because of you and your husband.  YTA", "YTA. You're honestly telling me that in 26 years your daughter has done zero to be proud of? Wow her therapist must love the money they are getting after this poor girl had you as a parent.", "YTA\n\nWhile I don't believe in participation trophy parenting, its VERY clear you highly favor your son over your daughter.\n\nIf it comes through that clearly in a post, I assure you she has felt it and seen it exponentially over the years. She may very well not be succeeding at things because she knows she will never be good enough for you.", "YTA. Just cause Kevin may have a more impressive resume doesn't mean it's right to give him Golden Child treatment.\n\nIf anything it seems like Leah may need more of your support but nah you just wanna go on about Kevin cause you can brag about him", "YTA\n\nYou are comparing your children to each other and Leah isn't at all like Kevin so she loses. Kevin ticks all your boxes that define success and the result is pride. Leah tries and quits if she is not perfect the 1st time she tries it; who set her up to believe that she *must* start at the top or it's not good enough? Was it you, OP? \n\nDo you have children or designer paper dolls?  Is there really *nothing* about Leah that pleases you? Nice girl and respectful?  Seriously, that's the sum total of your daughter's life to you? No wonder she's angry, her POV must be very different than yours.", "INFO: What did you do to foster and help develop grit and perseverance in your daughter?", "YTA. \n\nAnd thank you for reminding me to go call my parents and thank them for always loving me and being proud of me (and expressing that to me) even though I haven't always lived up to my potential or found a dream career they could brag about to their friends. \n\nSometimes I take for granted that I actually have amazing parents. Then people like you show up on this subreddit.", "Reread what you wrote. This is quite heartbreaking - I'm sorry for your daughter. YTA", "YTA\n\nIt's obvious you never really bothered helping your daughter, but are all too happy to coast on the coattails of the child to which it all came too easily", "YTA BIGTIME its not your child's responsibility to make you proud. It's their job to just live a happy life. You're a bitch. My mom is the same way because I'm not in her religion. She will never say she's proud of me because she has different ideas of what success is than me. Maybe you could dig deeper and try to get to know her as a person and not as just this extension of you and your husband.", "Our baby turned 21\n\nThat phrase, right there, spoke volumes. He's your golden child. He probably got showered with praise all his life while your daughter was always the second class citizen. Let's face it, you're never going to be proud of your daughter because you pour all your emotional energy into your golden child. I feel very bad for your grandchild!", "Sorry, YTA. There are reasons you're proud of her  (nice, respectful, ...), but you put them after telling her you're not. Insensitive at best.", "NTA. By the sound of it, she hasn\u2019t done anything substantial with her life. She even gave up on her child. You\u2019re not wrong, there\u2019s nothing to be proud of.", "NTA all the people saying y t a need to get a grip. How is it the mothers fault? The daughter decided she wanted all of these things onlt to give them up. For example, she wanted to be a mom, and her mother gave her good advice that she has the rest of her life, but it is up to her. But when she got pregnant, she decided she didn't want to be a mom anymore, so now OP raises her grandchild. Babies arent accessories. The daughter is a massive asshole", "Fuck yes YTA.", "Let me guess, ever since childhood Kevin needed less help succeeding. Instead of giving Leah extra attention to ensure she could succeed as well, you guys just focused on Kevin because it made you feel like great parents having such an easily successful child. Leah picked up on this, as ALL children do, and it impacted her self worth over years and years. Why try when no one gives you praise for it? And you\u2019ll never be as noticeable as Kevin.\n\nThen you literally confirmed it by saying she\u2019s done nothing you\u2019d be proud of in 26 years. Wow. Shit parents. \n\nAlso you can\u2019t even fucking hide your preference for Kevin, \u201cmy baby\u201d ew.\n\nYTA.", "NTA For specifically not saying you've ever told her you're proud of her.\n\n I don't care what the daughter has done.\nIf you abandon your kid with you parents there's nothing to be proud of anymore lol. It essentially cancels out everything you could've done, which from what this post reads, is nothing. \n\nThe daughter is a failure, her parents aren't the best either, but if we take ops words as an absolute truth and they had the same opportunities, the son was able to use those opportunities and NOT ruin his parents golden years by forcing them to raise another kid.\n\nDon't care if I get down voted to hell, fuck parents who get kids and make it everyone else's problem.", "I will be downvoted for this but NTA. Omg if the roles were reversed here and your son had abandoned his kid because he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d the comments would be VERY different here. She stopped picking up her child and just left him at your place and somehow you\u2019re the asshole for that. That\u2019s enough Reddit for today", "Hmm OP you seem a bit like my parents with their favorite golden child and it was possible to tell I was not their favorite and it hurts.  Shouldn\u2019t have been a favorite and should\u2019ve been able to feel the love equally.  I was able to overcome though and be successful and I get diagnosed with adhd until i was pushing 40. Part of it was to prove my parents wrong in how they favored the golden male child who can do no wrong.  \n\nESH.  You for having a golden child and her for abandoning her kid and not trying to do anything to help herself.", "ESH - both you and your daughter are AHs.  You for obviously favoring your son over your daughter and your daughter for acting like a child and never growing up.  She wanted to be a Mom and yet abandoned her child (that's exactly what she did).  \n\nThe language of your post shows how much you favor your son.", "I think YTA for telling her she never did anything to make you proud. Probably true but she did not need to hear it. Some kids are just a pain and frankly that sounds like her. She sounds off and that gets in the way of her succeeding or fully bonding. Again I would tell her you love her, are sorry for what you said and tell her if she wants to see a counselor you will pay for it. She likely needs some DBT or CBT.", "YTA - You clearly have a favorite child and you let her know that, clearly and unequivocally.  If you want to own that, fine. However, she is allowed to be upset and hurt about it too.  \n\nI don't believe there is nothing about her that you are not proud of. Just being \"a nice girl and very respectful\" is something to be proud of.  The fact that she is always up for trying something new even though the last thing failed, is something to be proud of.  \n\nBTW - Trying something new and giving up if you are not great right away is very much \"gifted child syndrome\" behavior and is usually learned from the parents. She is likely trying to find that one thing she can do better than her brother so that you love her the same way.  Saying you are proud of her trying something new and that you know she can succeed would help a lot. \n\nAnd when she says you are never said you are proud of her, what she really wants is for you to say you love her exactly the way she is right now.", "YTA.

It\u2019s very clear why she never stuck with anything, because she would never be as good as your golden son. Children improve from positive reinforcement which it sounds like you never gave. Grow up and recognize that if she wasn\u2019t as motivated to do things as her brother, as her parent you should have encouraged her.

You don\u2019t have a single nice thing to say about your daughter, huh?", "Kudos to you for being able to have her around after she ditched her own child. \n\nNTA - I myself would have struggled with that. \n\nYes, all children should be encouraged, lifted up, and told good things about themselves; but she is also an adult, at least by age, and should be taking some responsibility at something. to forgo her own child though is just....beyond disappointing.", "Did you give her praise and encouragement when she did do something well? Or were the Bs & Cs ignored because her brother had all As? She said she didn\u2019t want to go to college, but did for you and your husband you thought that would work out well? When she did try an activity was she supported and encouraged to keep trying? Or were you ok with her quitting because she wasn\u2019t the super star her brother would be? Did she stop parenting because her partner left her and she\u2019s spent her whole life not measuring up so this was another thing she knew she couldn\u2019t do and it was easier to just walk away? She left her baby with you and this didn\u2019t raise serious red flags that there was something really wrong? You\u2019ve really never told her you were proud of her? She\u2019s done nothing in 26 years that warranted praise? Either she\u2019s an astonishingly ignorant person or you failed as parents.", "INFO\n\nDo you think she's a failure?

At this point, yes it sounds like her life is not together, but it also sounds like she never had the vote of confidence you gave your son. No matter how much you tell yourself you don\u2019t have favorites, your children can feel the difference. You might want to actively put a little more of your spirit and encouragement toward the child that needs it more right now and let her know you believe she can accomplish things and is capable.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, what accomplishments is she talking about?", "NTA.

Kevin is a great student, and a great athlete, has goals and works hard for them. Leah is the kind to have big goals too but gives up very easily. Both of our children have had the same opportunities growing up and neither has had to help or work more than the other did. \n\nLeah had tried many activities during her life, the problem is that if she's not excellent at it right away then she gets frustrated and gives up. This is a pattern in her life. Kevin, on the other hand, has always been into sports, he played football through school, and he also plays baseball, basketball, and soccer. He's also better at school than she is, I think part of that is because he had to keep up his grades if he wanted to continue in the school team. Leah didn't have a reason to have great grades so although she never failed a class either, her grades had always been lower than Kevin's. After graduating Leah wasn't interested in pursuing further education, still as it would make my husband and I happy that she would at least try it, she did. She wasn't able to finish her second semester because she didn't like it. She got into a job after that which is fine if she liked that. She and her boyfriend (they had been together since high school) got engaged that same year too and Leah told us she wanted to be a mom, she felt like that was her call. She was very young, but I was too when I had her so it's fine. She got pregnant, but she and the guy broke off, she couldn't take care of her baby so my husband and I are raising our grandson. Now she's 26 and the truth is she hasn't fulfilled any of her wishes or goals. She doesn't have a career, is not married, and is not a mother (she does nothing of the care and doesn't live with us)\n\nKevin won a scholarship because he's an athlete. Now he's studying at a prestigious university and is part of his college's football team too. He's fulfilling his dreams because he's working on them. \n\nLast week was Kevin's birthday, our baby turned 21 so my husband and I planned a small party for him. We were all having a good time, Kevin was telling us about how good his grades were this last semester. I told him we were very proud of him for working so hard. Leah told me I had never told her that I was proud of her, I told her this was not the moment to talk about that because this party was for her brother and she dropped it. \n\nHowever, she brought it up again the next day at my house. She asked me why I never told her I'm proud of her, so I told her that I don't feel like she has done something to be proud of. Like I'm proud that she's a nice girl and very respectful, but she still hasn't done something to fulfill her dreams and make us proud. \nShe went off on me and accused me of telling her she's a failure although I did not do that. She was very angry and left. \nMy husband agrees with me but she's angry, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was average in school at best - and not for a lack of trying, I worked my ass off, but I always seemed to fall just a little short. I'm not amazing at anything I do - I was in band and played two instruments, meh at best. I was on the school paper, my writing was okay. I went to college and did well enough, but again, not great at academics. It took me over a year out of college to get a job, and it was a terrible, soul-sucking job. I finally left it after almost nine years after failing to get several promotions and never advancing any further. That was in November, and I'm still unemployed now because my resume just isn't anything amazing and I'm not really marketable. I'm remarkably, painfully average and I'm aware of it every single day.\n\nAnd my mom, for all the ways she failed me (and there are many ways), still managed to say she was proud of me at least twice in my life - when I graduated high school and college. You couldn't even manage to tell her you were proud of her for graduating high school? Or for at least *trying* to go to college (which is freaking hard, btw, my wife has been trying for years and has kept dropping out for Personal Reasons) to make you happy? Did you *ever* support her?\n\nAt the same time... your daughter has to take responsibility for herself at some point. My mom did a lot of horrible things, and they absolutely still have an affect on me today, but I can't blame her forever. And abandoning your kid is... ugh. Like, if she knows she isn't fit to be a mother that's one thing, but it's still up to her to make sure the child is properly cared for. I'm curious about why the ex can't, but that's another thing entirely.", "NTA!

My son is 17, and stands 6\u20191 and is about 245 pounds with a moustache and I call him baby all the time, along with my daughter who is 14 and 5\u20198, so I don\u2019t see why that keeps getting mentioned.", "Nta.", "ESH  \n\n\nShe sucks for abandoning her child \\[4/5\\]  \n\n\nYou suck for clearing having a golden child, even before the grandchild came. \\[2/5\\]  \n\n\nThe family needs therapy, and she needs to take responsibility for her actions.

I have had to forgive myself for a **LOT** of things that I had no control over. It's not a fix all, not everything can be put under the neurodivergent umbrella, but struggling, being undiagnosed and not getting the help you need is not something she is responsible for.\n\nShe is responsible if she got a diagnosis, the tools to move forward and still doesn't. Right now, she's floating in an ocean trying to find the shore but not even knowing which direction to go. Shouting \"just swim towards land!\" is unhelpful when someone can't see anything beyond the water around them, but it's all OP seems capable of doing.\n\nIf our assumptions of undiagnosed ADHD are correct, I hope she is able to be more productive going forward and a more engaged parent. She deserves the chance to try.\n\nUndiagnosed neurodiversity is crippling, and it only gets worse the older you get, the further from your peers you feel in terms of development.\n\nOP is TA here, but it's not too late to throw a floatation device and a compass to her daughter.", "I was looking for a comment like this one to piggyback off of, because the whole time I was reading this I thought, \"Oh yeah, this girl is neurodivergent as hell.\" Frequently dropping any new hobby/endeavor as soon as it gets difficult or when it doesn't come naturally is a common problem in ND folks, and her observation of OP never being proud of her, never SUPPORTING her, and her reaction to OP's honest response reeks of Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria.\n\nHowever, I do want to point out this: \n\n>Her blaming you now for still being stuck is on her.\n\nUndiagnosed neurodivergence can often lead to a lack of self-awareness, and a fear of moving forward due to crippling decision paralysis. (Source: was in the same boat for a long time and joined a support group for ND folks with the same problem). I know it's conjecture based on my own life experiences, but it's possible that OP's daughter may have no clue how to move forward and is afraid that, like all other attempts she's made to try something new of her own volition, it will be too hard so she gives up before she has a chance to fail. The key is that she needs someone to help her and give her guidance - it sounds like OP was never in her corner. And the fact is, lashing out at a parent who has never supported her is EASIER.  \n\nBut you do have a point about it being on her for internalizing mom's lack of support. I just wanted to point out that, when you have zero support and no clue how/where to start, it's harder than it sounds. And when all you've ever done is fail every time you try, it can also be scary.", "Adhd was my first thought when saying she jumps around and doesn\u2019t finish anything.", "This right here!  I grew up a lot like OP daughter.  I was brought up by an Asian tiger mom before that was a thing.  I was pushed and pushed until I stopped caring and rebelled to no end.

The only \"consistent\" thing I stuck with was agriculture but I also have a younger sibling that very much got the golden child treatment where I was the middle child and kind of ignored.

Rarely did they show up to my events like livestock shows or competitions where as my younger sibling was handed many things in life my older sibling and I had to grow up doing/paying for ourselves.  \n\n\nI didnt get diagnosed till i sought out help for myself in my late 20s after having a child at 25 and being just very short tempered and many other divergent patterns getting worse/unmanageable. I even strictly remember growing up and begging my parents for help but since I had been \"tested at an early (elementary) age and they said i wasnt I couldnt possibly\"...It was just a not trying hard enough/not putting in enough effort/not studying well.

Like, if I had a kid that has never succeeded in anything notable but still tried his damnest every single time, I would be able to say I am proud of his effort at the end of the day. But if they never really tried and inevitably failed? What is there to be proud of? People on this sub need to stop going to a non-neurotypical condition as a reason for failure.

It even has a term \"gifted child syndrome\".  \n\n\nI'd be curious to know if the daughter was praised a lot and excelled easily when she was very young (toddler to elementary age). A lot of kids that have a really easy time in the beginning with things like reading or art, etc., get praised considerably for what comes easily to them, and then when they find themselves in the situation where their peers have caught up to them and they actually have to try, they just can't bring themselves to do it.   \n\n\nPutting in effort and sticking with things that are hard is something that has to be learned, but while many kids learn it young, kids that don't have to try much when young- don't. And it is hard to learn later in life.

I apologize if that comes off as flippant.

She's the not the high and mighty achiever like golden child Kevin but I can not believe she has never done a single thing in her life that you could be proud of. \n\nWhat I see is that once a son was born, your interest in helping Leah seemed to fade. If she struggled in school, was she ever tested for a attention disorder, learning disability or did you offer a tutor? Probably not because that would have interfered with Kevin's schedule and Kevin's sports equipment needs and you would have had to actually give her some time and attention and it's easier to label her lazy than confront the idea that maybe you have failed in your parenting duties to her or you had a child that was not perfect like Kevin.", "You made a post on AITA about your relationship with her.
