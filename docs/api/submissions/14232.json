{"id": 14232, "submission_id": "12eods9", "title": "AITA for not telling my daughter I'm proud of her, but being proud of my son?", "selftext": "My (f48) children Leah (f26) and Kevin (m21) are complete opposites. Kevin is a great student, and a great athlete, has goals and works hard for them. Leah is the kind to have big goals too but gives up very easily. Both of our children have had the same opportunities growing up and neither has had to help or work more than the other did. \n\nLeah had tried many activities during her life, the problem is that if she's not excellent at it right away then she gets frustrated and gives up. This is a pattern in her life. Kevin, on the other hand, has always been into sports, he played football through school, and he also plays baseball, basketball, and soccer. He's also better at school than she is, I think part of that is because he had to keep up his grades if he wanted to continue in the school team. Leah didn't have a reason to have great grades so although she never failed a class either, her grades had always been lower than Kevin's. After graduating Leah wasn't interested in pursuing further education, still as it would make my husband and I happy that she would at least try it, she did. She wasn't able to finish her second semester because she didn't like it. She got into a job after that which is fine if she liked that. She and her boyfriend (they had been together since high school) got engaged that same year too and Leah told us she wanted to be a mom, she felt like that was her call. She was very young, but I was too when I had her so it's fine. She got pregnant, but she and the guy broke off, she couldn't take care of her baby so my husband and I are raising our grandson. Now she's 26 and the truth is she hasn't fulfilled any of her wishes or goals. She doesn't have a career, is not married, and is not a mother (she does nothing of the care and doesn't live with us)\n\nKevin won a scholarship because he's an athlete. Now he's studying at a prestigious university and is part of his college's football team too. He's fulfilling his dreams because he's working on them. \n\nLast week was Kevin's birthday, our baby turned 21 so my husband and I planned a small party for him. We were all having a good time, Kevin was telling us about how good his grades were this last semester. I told him we were very proud of him for working so hard. Leah told me I had never told her that I was proud of her, I told her this was not the moment to talk about that because this party was for her brother and she dropped it. \n\nHowever, she brought it up again the next day at my house. She asked me why I never told her I'm proud of her, so I told her that I don't feel like she has done something to be proud of. Like I'm proud that she's a nice girl and very respectful, but she still hasn't done something to fulfill her dreams and make us proud. \nShe went off on me and accused me of telling her she's a failure although I did not do that. She was very angry and left. \nMy husband agrees with me but she's angry, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680880184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12eods9/aita_for_not_telling_my_daughter_im_proud_of_her/", "score": 3596, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you know...sometimes it can be a really different story than expected...\n\nI was not wrong in my first assumption, OP definitely TA.\n\nYou seriously told your kid you've never once told her you're proud of because she had nothing to be proud of?\n\nSo you're saying from the time she was born not one thing she ever did was worth saying you were proud of her?  \n\nSo she went from ages: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, and not once you said \"I'm proud of you\"?\n\nAt what point do you think she just gave up on her self confidence with a parent as cold hearted as you?   \n\nYou definitely have a golden child, and she has been discarded as irrelevant.\n\nYou know the funny thing... the Golden Child is usually trying to live up to your standards, he's most likely living his life for you, not for himself.  Eventually those golden children burn out bright and fast, and your daughter if ever she received the right attention from a considerate parent could have bloomed later on in life, but since she wasn't living up to your expectations when she was younger... nothing worth encouraging here.... so so sad for her.\n\nShe needs to find a loving partner who actually can \"lift her up in life\" and start a family far from your judgment.", "ESH. It doesn\u2019t sound like you ever supported your daughter the way she needed. You claim you treated your kids \u2018equally\u2019\u2014which we can all here tell is bull-ony\u2014but what you should\u2019ve done is support your daughter in the way she *needed.*\n\nOn the other hand she\u2019s 26 years old, and you\u2019re raising her daughter for her because she can\u2019t get her act together. It\u2019s reasonable for you to have *thoughts* on that. Maybe it\u2019s time for her to stop caring so much about what you think about her, and start focusing on her life so SHE can support her OWN daughter. She should care about making her own daughter proud of her, not you.", "ESH except Kevin.\n\nThis whole post hits a little too close to home. I can hear the subtext coming through the screen. You didn\u2019t say your daughter was lazy and had wasted her potential but you didn\u2019t have to.\n\nWhen I feel those buzzwords my immediate reaction is neurodiversity, specifically ADHD and what would have been labeled ADD when your daughter was a child. However, it could be many other things that often go overlooked in girls and women.\n\nHas she ever seen a therapist? Has anyone ever suggested she needed additional help growing up?\n\nSomeone who\u2019s so unfocused doesn\u2019t want to be. They lack the ability to follow things through.  This is especially hard because they often react to the world differently than most. \n\nThink of it this way: if everyone tells you something is a doorway and all you have to do is walk through it, everyone (including yourself) are going to believe you are lazy and stupid for not walking through. However, once you realize what is a doorway to everyone else is a window to you then things start making more sense. You weren\u2019t lazy or stupid, going through is just a bit harder for you. Once you have the tools you need, even if other people don\u2019t need them, you can go though like everyone else.\n\nAll of that is to say that part of this is your fault for not finding the tools that would motivate your daughter. It would be one thing if she was living a simple but happy life. It\u2019s another for her to still be aimless and clearly struggling and the only helps she\u2019s ever received is the message to get over it.\n\nThe other part of this is that while you may have missed things growing up she is now a grown woman. She now has the power to seek help on her own and change and grow. \n\nHer not having what she needed growing up to make you proud is on you. Her blaming you now for still being stuck is on her.", "I feel like there has got to be missing info here - how and why did you end up raising Leah\u2019s child while she lives elsewhere on her own?  Does she have mental health or addiction troubles?  *She* must think she\u2019s done something you should be proud of, so has she gone through something that makes just being alive and functioning an achievement?", "Yes they had the same opportunities and you say neither of them needed help, but based on what you say alone it seems that Leah needed and still needs help. She probably has some undiagnosed learning disability/ADHD/something and needed you to take her to a therapist as a child to sort things out and help her better manager her time and abilities", ">our baby turned 21\n\nYou mean your golden child?  Did you ever stop to think that one of the reasons Leah may give up so easily is that you've spent her whole life making her feel like it doesn't matter if she does well anyway because, in your mind, she'll never be as good as her brother?  So, why would she bother trying when her efforts are never recognized?  While I think that not taking responsibility for her own child is not a good thing, I also feel like you have brought this on yourself because of how you raised her.  She is who she is because of you and your husband.  YTA", "YTA. You're honestly telling me that in 26 years your daughter has done zero to be proud of? Wow her therapist must love the money they are getting after this poor girl had you as a parent.", "YTA\n\nWhile I don't believe in participation trophy parenting, its VERY clear you highly favor your son over your daughter.\n\nIf it comes through that clearly in a post, I assure you she has felt it and seen it exponentially over the years. She may very well not be succeeding at things because she knows she will never be good enough for you.", "YTA. Just cause Kevin may have a more impressive resume doesn't mean it's right to give him Golden Child treatment.\n\nIf anything it seems like Leah may need more of your support but nah you just wanna go on about Kevin cause you can brag about him", "YTA\n\nYou are comparing your children to each other and Leah isn't at all like Kevin so she loses. Kevin ticks all your boxes that define success and the result is pride. Leah tries and quits if she is not perfect the 1st time she tries it; who set her up to believe that she *must* start at the top or it's not good enough? Was it you, OP? \n\nDo you have children or designer paper dolls?  Is there really *nothing* about Leah that pleases you? Nice girl and respectful?  Seriously, that's the sum total of your daughter's life to you? No wonder she's angry, her POV must be very different than yours.", "INFO: What did you do to foster and help develop grit and perseverance in your daughter?", "YTA. \n\nAnd thank you for reminding me to go call my parents and thank them for always loving me and being proud of me (and expressing that to me) even though I haven't always lived up to my potential or found a dream career they could brag about to their friends. \n\nSometimes I take for granted that I actually have amazing parents. Then people like you show up on this subreddit.", "Reread what you wrote. This is quite heartbreaking - I'm sorry for your daughter. YTA", "YTA\n\nIt's obvious you never really bothered helping your daughter, but are all too happy to coast on the coattails of the child to which it all came too easily", "YTA BIGTIME its not your child's responsibility to make you proud. It's their job to just live a happy life. You're a bitch. My mom is the same way because I'm not in her religion. She will never say she's proud of me because she has different ideas of what success is than me. Maybe you could dig deeper and try to get to know her as a person and not as just this extension of you and your husband.", "Our baby turned 21\n\nThat phrase, right there, spoke volumes. He's your golden child. He probably got showered with praise all his life while your daughter was always the second class citizen. Let's face it, you're never going to be proud of your daughter because you pour all your emotional energy into your golden child. I feel very bad for your grandchild!", "Sorry, YTA. There are reasons you're proud of her  (nice, respectful, ...), but you put them after telling her you're not. Insensitive at best.", "NTA. By the sound of it, she hasn\u2019t done anything substantial with her life. She even gave up on her child. You\u2019re not wrong, there\u2019s nothing to be proud of.", "NTA all the people saying y t a need to get a grip. How is it the mothers fault? The daughter decided she wanted all of these things onlt to give them up. For example, she wanted to be a mom, and her mother gave her good advice that she has the rest of her life, but it is up to her. But when she got pregnant, she decided she didn't want to be a mom anymore, so now OP raises her grandchild. Babies arent accessories. The daughter is a massive asshole", "Fuck yes YTA.", "Let me guess, ever since childhood Kevin needed less help succeeding. Instead of giving Leah extra attention to ensure she could succeed as well, you guys just focused on Kevin because it made you feel like great parents having such an easily successful child. Leah picked up on this, as ALL children do, and it impacted her self worth over years and years. Why try when no one gives you praise for it? And you\u2019ll never be as noticeable as Kevin.\n\nThen you literally confirmed it by saying she\u2019s done nothing you\u2019d be proud of in 26 years. Wow. Shit parents. \n\nAlso you can\u2019t even fucking hide your preference for Kevin, \u201cmy baby\u201d ew.\n\nYTA.", "NTA For specifically not saying you've ever told her you're proud of her.\n\n I don't care what the daughter has done.\nIf you abandon your kid with you parents there's nothing to be proud of anymore lol. It essentially cancels out everything you could've done, which from what this post reads, is nothing. \n\nThe daughter is a failure, her parents aren't the best either, but if we take ops words as an absolute truth and they had the same opportunities, the son was able to use those opportunities and NOT ruin his parents golden years by forcing them to raise another kid.\n\nDon't care if I get down voted to hell, fuck parents who get kids and make it everyone else's problem.", "I will be downvoted for this but NTA. Omg if the roles were reversed here and your son had abandoned his kid because he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d the comments would be VERY different here. She stopped picking up her child and just left him at your place and somehow you\u2019re the asshole for that. That\u2019s enough Reddit for today", "Hmm OP you seem a bit like my parents with their favorite golden child and it was possible to tell I was not their favorite and it hurts.  Shouldn\u2019t have been a favorite and should\u2019ve been able to feel the love equally.  I was able to overcome though and be successful and I get diagnosed with adhd until i was pushing 40. Part of it was to prove my parents wrong in how they favored the golden male child who can do no wrong.  \n\nESH.  You for having a golden child and her for abandoning her kid and not trying to do anything to help herself.", "ESH - both you and your daughter are AHs.  You for obviously favoring your son over your daughter and your daughter for acting like a child and never growing up.  She wanted to be a Mom and yet abandoned her child (that's exactly what she did).  \n\nThe language of your post shows how much you favor your son.", "I think YTA for telling her she never did anything to make you proud. Probably true but she did not need to hear it. Some kids are just a pain and frankly that sounds like her. She sounds off and that gets in the way of her succeeding or fully bonding. Again I would tell her you love her, are sorry for what you said and tell her if she wants to see a counselor you will pay for it. She likely needs some DBT or CBT.", "YTA - You clearly have a favorite child and you let her know that, clearly and unequivocally.  If you want to own that, fine. However, she is allowed to be upset and hurt about it too.  \n\nI don't believe there is nothing about her that you are not proud of. Just being \"a nice girl and very respectful\" is something to be proud of.  The fact that she is always up for trying something new even though the last thing failed, is something to be proud of.  \n\nBTW - Trying something new and giving up if you are not great right away is very much \"gifted child syndrome\" behavior and is usually learned from the parents. She is likely trying to find that one thing she can do better than her brother so that you love her the same way.  Saying you are proud of her trying something new and that you know she can succeed would help a lot. \n\nAnd when she says you are never said you are proud of her, what she really wants is for you to say you love her exactly the way she is right now.", "YTA.

It\u2019s very clear why she never stuck with anything, because she would never be as good as your golden son. Children improve from positive reinforcement which it sounds like you never gave. Grow up and recognize that if she wasn\u2019t as motivated to do things as her brother, as her parent you should have encouraged her.

You don\u2019t have a single nice thing to say about your daughter, huh?", "Kudos to you for being able to have her around after she ditched her own child. \n\nNTA - I myself would have struggled with that. \n\nYes, all children should be encouraged, lifted up, and told good things about themselves; but she is also an adult, at least by age, and should be taking some responsibility at something. to forgo her own child though is just....beyond disappointing.", "Did you give her praise and encouragement when she did do something well? Or were the Bs & Cs ignored because her brother had all As? She said she didn\u2019t want to go to college, but did for you and your husband you thought that would work out well? When she did try an activity was she supported and encouraged to keep trying? Or were you ok with her quitting because she wasn\u2019t the super star her brother would be? Did she stop parenting because her partner left her and she\u2019s spent her whole life not measuring up so this was another thing she knew she couldn\u2019t do and it was easier to just walk away? She left her baby with you and this didn\u2019t raise serious red flags that there was something really wrong? You\u2019ve really never told her you were proud of her? She\u2019s done nothing in 26 years that warranted praise? Either she\u2019s an astonishingly ignorant person or you failed as parents.", "INFO\n\nDo you think she's a failure?

Not getting a degree? (Not that it is a problem she chose not to but university is obviously a reason you are proud of her brother) Breaking up her engagement?

At this point, yes it sounds like her life is not together, but it also sounds like she never had the vote of confidence you gave your son. No matter how much you tell yourself you don\u2019t have favorites, your children can feel the difference. You might want to actively put a little more of your spirit and encouragement toward the child that needs it more right now and let her know you believe she can accomplish things and is capable.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, what accomplishments is she talking about?", "NTA.

Kevin is a great student, and a great athlete, has goals and works hard for them. Leah is the kind to have big goals too but gives up very easily. Both of our children have had the same opportunities growing up and neither has had to help or work more than the other did. \n\nLeah had tried many activities during her life, the problem is that if she's not excellent at it right away then she gets frustrated and gives up. This is a pattern in her life. Kevin, on the other hand, has always been into sports, he played football through school, and he also plays baseball, basketball, and soccer. He's also better at school than she is, I think part of that is because he had to keep up his grades if he wanted to continue in the school team. Leah didn't have a reason to have great grades so although she never failed a class either, her grades had always been lower than Kevin's. After graduating Leah wasn't interested in pursuing further education, still as it would make my husband and I happy that she would at least try it, she did. She wasn't able to finish her second semester because she didn't like it. She got into a job after that which is fine if she liked that. She and her boyfriend (they had been together since high school) got engaged that same year too and Leah told us she wanted to be a mom, she felt like that was her call. She was very young, but I was too when I had her so it's fine. She got pregnant, but she and the guy broke off, she couldn't take care of her baby so my husband and I are raising our grandson. Now she's 26 and the truth is she hasn't fulfilled any of her wishes or goals. She doesn't have a career, is not married, and is not a mother (she does nothing of the care and doesn't live with us)\n\nKevin won a scholarship because he's an athlete. Now he's studying at a prestigious university and is part of his college's football team too. He's fulfilling his dreams because he's working on them. \n\nLast week was Kevin's birthday, our baby turned 21 so my husband and I planned a small party for him. We were all having a good time, Kevin was telling us about how good his grades were this last semester. I told him we were very proud of him for working so hard. Leah told me I had never told her that I was proud of her, I told her this was not the moment to talk about that because this party was for her brother and she dropped it. \n\nHowever, she brought it up again the next day at my house. She asked me why I never told her I'm proud of her, so I told her that I don't feel like she has done something to be proud of. Like I'm proud that she's a nice girl and very respectful, but she still hasn't done something to fulfill her dreams and make us proud. \nShe went off on me and accused me of telling her she's a failure although I did not do that. She was very angry and left. \nMy husband agrees with me but she's angry, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was average in school at best - and not for a lack of trying, I worked my ass off, but I always seemed to fall just a little short. I'm not amazing at anything I do - I was in band and played two instruments, meh at best. I was on the school paper, my writing was okay. I went to college and did well enough, but again, not great at academics. It took me over a year out of college to get a job, and it was a terrible, soul-sucking job. I finally left it after almost nine years after failing to get several promotions and never advancing any further. That was in November, and I'm still unemployed now because my resume just isn't anything amazing and I'm not really marketable. I'm remarkably, painfully average and I'm aware of it every single day.\n\nAnd my mom, for all the ways she failed me (and there are many ways), still managed to say she was proud of me at least twice in my life - when I graduated high school and college. You couldn't even manage to tell her you were proud of her for graduating high school? Or for at least *trying* to go to college (which is freaking hard, btw, my wife has been trying for years and has kept dropping out for Personal Reasons) to make you happy? Did you *ever* support her?\n\nAt the same time... your daughter has to take responsibility for herself at some point. My mom did a lot of horrible things, and they absolutely still have an affect on me today, but I can't blame her forever. And abandoning your kid is... ugh. Like, if she knows she isn't fit to be a mother that's one thing, but it's still up to her to make sure the child is properly cared for. I'm curious about why the ex can't, but that's another thing entirely.", "NTA! I don\u2019t see anywhere in the post where OP states she played favorites or favored her son over her daughter, or any parenting style being mentioned, just that one was more successful in their endeavors.

My son is 17, and stands 6\u20191 and is about 245 pounds with a moustache and I call him baby all the time, along with my daughter who is 14 and 5\u20198, so I don\u2019t see why that keeps getting mentioned.", "Nta.", "ESH  \n\n\nShe sucks for abandoning her child \\[4/5\\]  \n\n\nYou suck for clearing having a golden child, even before the grandchild came. \\[2/5\\]  \n\n\nThe family needs therapy, and she needs to take responsibility for her actions.

I have had to forgive myself for a **LOT** of things that I had no control over. It's not a fix all, not everything can be put under the neurodivergent umbrella, but struggling, being undiagnosed and not getting the help you need is not something she is responsible for.\n\nShe is responsible if she got a diagnosis, the tools to move forward and still doesn't. Right now, she's floating in an ocean trying to find the shore but not even knowing which direction to go. Shouting \"just swim towards land!\" is unhelpful when someone can't see anything beyond the water around them, but it's all OP seems capable of doing.\n\nIf our assumptions of undiagnosed ADHD are correct, I hope she is able to be more productive going forward and a more engaged parent. She deserves the chance to try.\n\nUndiagnosed neurodiversity is crippling, and it only gets worse the older you get, the further from your peers you feel in terms of development.\n\nOP is TA here, but it's not too late to throw a floatation device and a compass to her daughter.", "I was looking for a comment like this one to piggyback off of, because the whole time I was reading this I thought, \"Oh yeah, this girl is neurodivergent as hell.\" Frequently dropping any new hobby/endeavor as soon as it gets difficult or when it doesn't come naturally is a common problem in ND folks, and her observation of OP never being proud of her, never SUPPORTING her, and her reaction to OP's honest response reeks of Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria.\n\nHowever, I do want to point out this: \n\n>Her blaming you now for still being stuck is on her.\n\nUndiagnosed neurodivergence can often lead to a lack of self-awareness, and a fear of moving forward due to crippling decision paralysis. (Source: was in the same boat for a long time and joined a support group for ND folks with the same problem). I know it's conjecture based on my own life experiences, but it's possible that OP's daughter may have no clue how to move forward and is afraid that, like all other attempts she's made to try something new of her own volition, it will be too hard so she gives up before she has a chance to fail. The key is that she needs someone to help her and give her guidance - it sounds like OP was never in her corner. And the fact is, lashing out at a parent who has never supported her is EASIER.  \n\nBut you do have a point about it being on her for internalizing mom's lack of support. I just wanted to point out that, when you have zero support and no clue how/where to start, it's harder than it sounds. And when all you've ever done is fail every time you try, it can also be scary.", "Adhd was my first thought when saying she jumps around and doesn\u2019t finish anything.", "This right here!  I grew up a lot like OP daughter.  I was brought up by an Asian tiger mom before that was a thing.  I was pushed and pushed until I stopped caring and rebelled to no end.

The only \"consistent\" thing I stuck with was agriculture but I also have a younger sibling that very much got the golden child treatment where I was the middle child and kind of ignored.

Rarely did they show up to my events like livestock shows or competitions where as my younger sibling was handed many things in life my older sibling and I had to grow up doing/paying for ourselves.  \n\n\nI didnt get diagnosed till i sought out help for myself in my late 20s after having a child at 25 and being just very short tempered and many other divergent patterns getting worse/unmanageable. I even strictly remember growing up and begging my parents for help but since I had been \"tested at an early (elementary) age and they said i wasnt I couldnt possibly\"...It was just a not trying hard enough/not putting in enough effort/not studying well.

Like, if I had a kid that has never succeeded in anything notable but still tried his damnest every single time, I would be able to say I am proud of his effort at the end of the day. But if they never really tried and inevitably failed? What is there to be proud of? People on this sub need to stop going to a non-neurotypical condition as a reason for failure. Some people just suck as humans. It's the nature of things. Not everyone is hard working and motivated to attempt to be a success at something.

It even has a term \"gifted child syndrome\".  \n\n\nI'd be curious to know if the daughter was praised a lot and excelled easily when she was very young (toddler to elementary age). A lot of kids that have a really easy time in the beginning with things like reading or art, etc., get praised considerably for what comes easily to them, and then when they find themselves in the situation where their peers have caught up to them and they actually have to try, they just can't bring themselves to do it.   \n\n\nPutting in effort and sticking with things that are hard is something that has to be learned, but while many kids learn it young, kids that don't have to try much when young- don't. And it is hard to learn later in life.

I apologize if that comes off as flippant.

Meanwhile my brother was talked down to by my father while we were in elementary school because I was picking up things before my brother in his grade. This stopped at middle school but we all know the damage was done. My brother felt like nothing was worth the effort because praise was going towards me. If he wasn't great at the start he wanted to give up because he would be judged by being compared to me. We both grew up with me getting honor rolls and my brother not bothering with homework because he found it tedious. He was passing because he aced the tests solely. I ended up getting scholarships to college and my brother entered the workforce. The thing with the Golden Child is that you've instilled in them a fear of failure. Once they hit that first true failure then it becomes a near unstoppable spiral. I got depressed though got my degree and realized that I didn't want to be a vet. My brother got great experience at his job and has taken time to decide what he wants to do.\n\nAll of this is to say that you haven't given your daughter true unjudged support from her eyes. She's giving up because she knows you'll judge her to how you think your brother would've done had he tried. And don't say you wouldn't because at this point you have unconscious bias against your daughter. It sounds like she needs therapy to talk about her fears and to bounce ideas off unjudgmentally. If you haven't doomed this relationship then you should also do something new with her and struggle with her so she doesn't feel the pressure of success. Stop making her live according to her brothers standards (which should also be lowered by the way your setting him up for anxiety and depression.)

She may well have been as fully capable as her brother, but perhaps her mentalit\u00e9 was different. Some people are naturally optimistic and able to just push on. Others really struggle with pessimism, and when they hit a road block, it is just really hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's the adults job to help kids build that confidence, r\u00e9silience, persistence and independence. Maybe her parents gave her brother more support in any way he needed. Hard to know.

Never tried very hard, didn't have a lot of interests, etc. Which to an extent that's ok if that's how the person wants to live their life.

Leah is not at all blameless for her own decisions, but it was also OP's job to show their daughter that she was loved and supported while she was growing up, BEFORE she got pregnant, and yeah, never telling your kid that you're proud of them as far back as they can remember is a real AH move.", "Well, you know what they'd say if she did force her to stick with something, right?

Yeah, YTA.", "What about dance, theatre, sewing, knitting, gardening, dog training, horse riding, carpentry, pottery, baking, cake decorating, scouting, basket weaving, LARP?  \nThere's a lot of things a kid can easily develop a passion for, that aren't the generic sports and arts.", "Yes, but\u2026\n\nUntil the last 5 years, girls were rarely diagnosed with ADHD, and it turns out to be *really common* for women in their mid 20s-early 30s to get diagnosed and all of a sudden all of their struggles are shifted into sharp focus and there\u2019s a \u201choly shit\u201d moment. \n\nThat said, most of these women figure out coping mechanisms that work for them to do the shit they need to do. This woman has abandoned not only all of her hobbies and interests (normal) but also her *child* (not fucking normal). \n\nI\u2019m sure in her life she\u2019s done something that a parent could say they were proud of, and there definitely seems to be some favoritism going on here. But girl\u2026get your shit together you have a kid!", "I am not responding specifically to you, but more to the tone of this little thread.  \n\nOverall people are focused against the mother with no empathy for her.  People are inventing an imaginary ADHD diagnosis and placing no responsibility or criticism on the daughter.\n\nEven if she has as ADHD diagnosis that is wrong.", "Its absolutely ridiculous behaviour.  And these people are saying the mother is an asshole?  Taking on parental responsibilities as a grandmother.  It blows my mind that people can be this selfish, just choosing a person they align with as a victim who has zero responsibility.\n\nMust be nice to live your life just choosing yourself as the sole person who has needs and blaming everyone else when you have a bad day.  Then expecting a cookie to reward you for that.  Mindblowing.", "There's an awful lot of people here who are confusing \"explaining what might be going on\" with \"excusing it\".  \n\nI'm not sure why that is.\n\nExplaining WHY something might be happening is the first stage in FIXING IT. \n\nOr you can just sit there and allow people to continue circling around in patterns of failure, and just keep telling them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Because if they \\*cared enough\\*, they'd \\*just do it\\*.  \n\nYeah.  Because that always works so well. /s\n\nYou have to know what's wrong, before you can find a solution.  You have to admit that something is wrong in order to seek help.\n\nSo, does OP want to understand what may be going on, and figure out how to fix things (if possible)?  Or does she just want people to agree that she wasn't a bad mother and her daughter is a terrible person, and absolve OP from having to look any deeper?", "This all feels like my daughter too. She struggled a lot in later school, though was early on in excelled programs. She's incredibly smart, but just struggled with even simple tasks in school. I turned to a state accredited homeschooling program for her (as she also had issues with a boy SA'ing her and then when we brought it up to the school, they made her life a hellish schedule of which halls she could walk down at what times, where she could have lunch, etc). \n\nAnd she confided in me about her stress and anxiety in school multiple times. We tried different things to help her. I won't say I was perfect or even good, but I love her and tried my damnedest to help her. And I'm proud of her. She got her first real job and is living with a couple friends. She knows that I'm here for her, and she can always come home and/or ask for help. I tell her I'm proud of her. She saved up and bought a Dyson hairdryer and was so proud of this. And I told her I was impressed by it too. Cause what makes her happy, makes me happy too. And instead of trying to raise a family while searching for who she is and what she wants out of life, I talked to her about those conversations about her anxiety and stress and offered to help get her birth control if she wanted it (and I offered it starting around age 15 or so). She's 21, and she has told me how thankful she was for me stepping in and helping her get the depo shot when she was a teen. Cause she knows now that would've made her life hell and that she's not ready for kids even now. She enjoys having fun and just being young - and that too, is important. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that I don't know if my daughter has adhd, but a lot of what's said rings true; and even without knowing that could be an issue, I did everything in my power to help make her life better. Maybe I failed sometimes, but damn it I didn't just sit back and scold her. I tried. And I supported her every effort, even if it didn't turn out the way she hoped. And she's amazing. And I'm so proud of her. \n\nAll in all, OP major YTA", "ADHD is never an excuse for not raising your kid.", "They are Raising her child I would\nCall that helping.", "How to ADHD on youtube is pretty good!\n\nETA: Doctors can be a bit... Uneducated and biased, to say the least, about ADHD in general, but also about ADHD in AFAB (assigned female at birth) people and adults. You may have to try a couple of doctors until you get one that listens to you. Don't give up! I know it's SO hard, especially with the ADHD making it harder, but it's worth it. Do some research to see if there's anyone near you that specialises in AFAB people, particularly adults. Facebook groups or reddit may be of help there. There may be long waiting lists and it may be pricey, but it's worth it! In the meantime, you can have a look at \"natural\" things to help- there's some research that fish oil can help (if you're vegetarian, there's also vegetarian versions of the oil, I can't remember what it's called), and caffeine can also help, so a morning coffee can be a good idea!", "If someone has a behavior problem and you actually want to do something about it so it will be better, then yes, you totally should consider other roots of the behavior other than \"you are just lazy\". Even more when it is a treatable cause such as ADHD. Labeling someone as lazy won't shame them into better behavior. Chances are it will only make things worse. And \"some people are legitimately just lazy or unmotivated\" kinda implies a personality disorder, which is always a diagnosis of exclusion.\n\nEven if it isn't ADHD, I am yet to meet some unmotivated kid whose behavior didn't improve after treating them with respect, understanding and support. Everyone can bring something positive to the world if we give them the chance to do so. Some of them just will need more guidance than the others.", "I\u2019m talking about the past not the present. Dumping her child was wrong, I\u2019ve said that a lot. But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m personally focused on in my particular comment."]}
