He is a kid and wants his parents to be proud of his sporting accomplishments... I feel bad for both of you.", "NTA. I emotionally understand your parents perspective. But logically, not at all... they put you first, got wrapped up in their emotions and fears, and forgot that your brother is also a child (no ages listed but based on the football / hockey, I'm assuming he's in high school) who had to grow up pretty quickly bc he had a sick sister and probably didn't have the emotional support to process the feelings that went with having a sick sister. \n\nYour parents seem to be forgetting that there are two kids and two parents... you didn't need both parents at the same time.

You need to have a good conversation with your brother about all of this so it doesn't affect the bonding you two have. I don't think they're blaming it on you, they have a favourite child and it's you. They're not using you as an excuse. This just shows their favouritism. And they want you to feel the same and run all over him. \nWhen they start prioritizing both the children only then all of this can be fixed.", "NTA. Your brother sounds like he's a bit of one right now for resenting you for your parents' choices, but it also sounds like he's still a teenager, so will hopefully have time to learn and better understand that it's not something you asked for. Your parents are definitely the AH in all of it, though, because it is their responsibility to treat the two of you equitably. Not knowing what your illness is, it's hard to suggest how things could have been handled better, but they are the adults in the situation and your brother's feelings of being neglected or overlooked constantly are their and his responsibility, not yours.", "NTA! You\u2019re even standing up for your bratty little brother (hasn\u2019t acknowledged you in years? Ouch.) I read in a different post recently that kids express their anger towards someone it\u2019s safe to be angry at. He still needs your parents, so while it\u2019s unfair that he hates you, he also doesn\u2019t rely on you for survival. Your parents are responsible for meeting his emotional needs, which it sounds like they are not doing. Caring for you might be so draining for them that they don\u2019t have the bandwidth to give your brother the attention and care he deserves. They should be doing a better job of mentally organizing what needs to be prioritized, which takes energy itself to do. You pointed out to your mom that she is coming up short in this respect, and she didn\u2019t like that, and that\u2019s understandable, but she needed to hear it. Maybe she feels like if she devotes 100% of her efforts towards you that you can be saved/fixed, whereas your brother will survive even if he is neglected. Unfortunately, he probably won\u2019t thrive. Humans are complex creatures, and need all kinds of attention from their parents to build their self-esteem, to understand how they fit into this world and build their sense of value. Your parents are neglecting your brother emotionally. Your parents treating you two so differently has negatively affected his relationship with them and with you. He might end up feeling extremely guilty when he\u2019s older for how he treated you, which is just another way your parents are doing him a disservice. I\u2019m sure your parents are doing what they think is best, but they need to realize that your brother is suffering, too. I hope things get better for all of you. ETA Jesus, no one read my full comment obviously\u2026 he\u2019s in high school and hasn\u2019t spoken to his sister who didn\u2019t do shit to him in YEARS. Kind of bratty. OP doesn\u2019t deserve to be hated and ignored. His mom is disappointed with his behavior for a reason, even if she and the dad are the much, much bigger assholes.", "NTA\n\nIf you can, you should start to show your brother that you love him and care about him.\nLike showing up for important events in his life and buying his favorite candy.\n\nYour parents has neglected him.\n\nThey are definitely using your health as an excuse but we all know that the excuse doesn't explain everything. They never went to any of his games. To your brother is would have meant a lot if just one of them showed up or they just showed up once.\n\nYour brother needs to know that someone in his family cares about him. And that somebody seems to be you. Your parents act like they don't care about him.", "NTA \nIm the oldest sibling and as the oldest sister to my younger brother only us two with a single mother and dad we couldn\u2019t rely on with major health issues they shouldn\u2019t of used you as the fall guy. My mom had to miss one of my brothers wrestling matches because something was wrong and I needed to go to the emergency room and I think that was one of the only matches she missed to my knowledge I think he wrestled 4-5 years and he understood that we couldn\u2019t wait but he was still disappointed. When I was in the hospital for 8 weeks to do something to correct my kyphosis and the spinal fusion surgery he got to go on a two week trip with our aunt and uncle to a couple different states doing stuff I wish I could\u2019ve done instead of being in the hospital most of the summer. I did online school so I\u2019d be home 75/80% of the time and then go spend time with my aunt and uncle because our had cancer and my uncle worked nights, also so I could get time with my aunt who was like a second parent to us and was my favorite person in the world and he\u2019d get one on one time with mom and my mom got breaks from taking care of me . Being with my aunt and uncle I was closer to my drs and the hospital I go to incase of any emergencies but only one thing happened but because of it my mom made the hour trip and took me because it was not long after losing my aunt and my uncle wouldn\u2019t of known any information and it wasn\u2019t urgent we just wanted to make sure I was ok ended up with a GI bleed and needing blood and one night in the hospital. In my opinion parents with a sick kid and a healthy kid needs to make a better balance especially if they aren\u2019t a single parent", "This can happen even without a medical reason. When I was in high school choir, my dad complained about having to go to my concerts and as soon as I had my license I drove myself and he didn\u2019t go. But four years later my sister started high school and he was at every concert talking about how proud he was. Sometimes parents just suck in that way. But OP is definitely NTA.", "I\u2019ll be honest, when I was sick, I didn\u2019t have anything let alone anyone else in mind. I was usually too sick to even think. I spent a long period of my life in a hospital. The second I got better and realized how my parents have been treating my brother, I\u2019ve been encouraging my parents to spend more time with him and to let me be. I regret not realizing sooner but I\u2019m allowed to give myself some leeway, I literally almost died.", "This is a bizarre comment. \"How dare you, sick child, not realize what was happening while you were sick? You only realized when you grew up and got better? You must have been reveling in the attention you get from being hospitalized.\"\n\nWhew. Babe, most people don't get hospitalized for the _attention_. And even when someone loves their siblings, lbr: when people are sick, their priority isn't (and arguably shouldn't be) their perfectly healthy siblings. Maybe you're a saintly kind, but most people focus on getting better (or even just staying alive, depending on how sick they are).", "I disagree with calling the brother bratty. He's been neglected by his parents for years apparently and is still being neglected now that his sister is healthy.", "NTA it\u2019s their fault he hates you and you have a right to call them out.", "NTA you have 2 parents. 1 could have attended his games while 1 was with you. Your parents shoved him aside and blamed your health when really they are fully to blame.", "NTA your parents have neglected him for years and using you as a scapegoat. He won't forget you standing up for him.", "The only non-shit person is her brother. He's been neglected, pushed aside, ignored, and feels lesser in the eyes of his family. His needs aren't being met (emotional and developmental) and he sees OPs getting met above and beyond. I guarantee neither parent has missed any of OPs milestones or accomplishments.", "Just out of curiosity are you going to try and repair your relationship with your brother? \n\nJust want to clarify I\u2019m not blaming you or anything, just think your brother resents you because your parents constantly chose you over him and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that your relationship ship with your brother has turned sour because of it.", "I've been the healthy sibling. \n\nAt some point the sick sibling starts to realise if I play on certain symptoms, or \"I don't feel well today\" that they get attention or get out of having to do chores etc. Even if it isn't a conscious choice or realization it still happens.\n\nMy parents never went to a rugby game, in fact it took me 3 years to even get them to allow me to sign up for sports because it would be too much hassle between having to care for sibling and go pick me up and drop me off 15 minutes down the road twice a week for training/practice, while my coach picked me up for games. They used sibling as an excuse not to go. And she knew it and threw it in my face constantly. \n\nI had 2 parents but neither one could have given me any time. When one did try to do stuff with me while the other looked after sibling there would ALWAYS be an emergency. You know that the emergency invariably was? Sister would throw a tantrum \"I'm scared, where's daddy. Blah blah blah.\"\n\nNever went to an awards night of mine but certainly went for the sibling. And she gloated.\n\nSo yeah nah. Kids aren't oblivious. Sick kids aren't poor little angels. Some are absolute dicks.", "Oh, I absolutely believe that. And if OP had said, \"I've been better for years\" or \"I have long stretches of being fine,\" that would be more likely.\n\nIt just doesn't sound like OP has been better for long enough to be aware/able to address the situation before recently. OP says she got sick as a teenager, and her brother is still a teenager. She said they were close as kids, so the age gap doesn't sound huge. She also said she got better this summer, had another health scare, but assumed her parents would go back to her brother's games now that she's better. Nothing about that suggests she's been malicious or manipulating the situation for her own benefit. The assumption she's been malicious with no evidence to support it doesn't make sense.", "We only have the OPs version to go from.\n\nI bet with OPs brother we would get a different version.\n\nThe truth is always somewhere in the middle.", "NTA\nI feel very sorry for you and your brother. The real assholes in this case are your parents. Your parents paying attention to your health issues? That's good but using that as an excuse to neglect your brother constantly, missing out on his games and telling him to \"grow tf up\" after leaving him out is not ok and I'm glad you stood by him. It's not your fault that he's being left out, you have health issues and you can't control it. This is on your parents definitely", "NTA. You are not at fault here. You don\u2019t seem to have demanded that they support you only, in fact you are arguing exactly the opposite. Your brother is also NTA. His anger is partially misdirected (since he seems upset with you in addition to your parents) but it is understandable, your parents are causing him to resent you, whether that is fair or not. Your parents however are wandering deep in AH territory and are considering building a lovely little log cabin in there. They need to grow up and realise that yes, one of their kids has health issues, but that doesn\u2019t mean that their other child has ceased to have needs or no longer wants their love and attention. \n\nYou don\u2019t mention ages at all so I don\u2019t know how viable this would be but could you show a united front against your parents by attending his events in their place? Basically mic they won\u2019t support him, you will. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option, it might be worth reaching out to your brother, ask if the two of you could go get coffee or something and just talk with him. Tell him how uncomfortable your parents are making you by sidelining him for you. Tell him it\u2019s not what you want. Tell him you are sorry that they have done that to him. He might be receptive, he might not, but then it will have been clearly said out loud. He may know in the back of his mind that you don\u2019t approve of their actions but sometimes it\u2019s not until we actually hear it said that it truly sinks in. It may take time for him to truly accept it but it could be an excellent first step. If he takes it well and is open to it, perhaps you could suggest slowly rebuilding your relationship separate from your parents influence, and maybe you could find ways to stand in solidarity against all of this.", "NTA, your parents need to parent both their children. Having a sick child is no excuse for neglecting their other children. \nI can interstate his resentment, I hope your relationship with him can be repaired. It is probably too late for your parents.", "You sound just as selfish as your sibling.", "How so", "ESH.\n\n1. Your brother has a right to feel the way he does.  His whole life he's been neglected because his sister's health took precedence over his whole childhood and anything he did.\n2. Your mom and dad were wrong.  They had two children, one of them could've supported your brother while the other stayed with or took care of your health needs.  Just because you couldn't go, doesn't mean that one of them couldn't.\n3. You're totally missing the point.  You admit your brother was wronged but I'm not detecting any empathy/sympathy to his experience.  To ask, \"maybe I fucked up\" leads me to believe, you relished in the attention.", "NTA. Honestly your mom is right babe. It is very unfortunate that your brother got less attention than you but that\u2019s not your fault. Him holding onto this resentment toward you says more about him than your parents. Best advice is to keep out of their relationship with their son. His issues\u2026his problem. Good luck!", "But she herself acknowledges that she's the reason (even tho it really isn't her fault) the brother got neglected, and even backed him up when the brother doesn't want anything to do with her??\n\nAnd it was something so literally out of her control (being sick) that it is nowhere near her fault things are like they are. How is she an asshole??", "NTA, and in a situation where it\u2019s so bad that even the golden cold (I\u2019m not implying you\u2019re anything bad) sees it and feels wrong about it, it must be really bad. Your mother should be ashamed for using you as an excuse all these years. If I were you I\u2019d try so hard to patch things up with your brother- you guys can still have a decent relationship despite her.", "I'm sorry you're going through this. I feel really bad for your brother because your parents have failed him miserably. I say that because if the person that's getting all the attention can see the hurt and miserey the other person is going through, then your parents have really let that poor kid down. I hope after he goes no contact with your parents, he will stay  in contact with you in the future. That poor  young man needs to be loved.", "NTA. I hope your health issues get better.", "NTA", "[removed]", "I mean...yeah kinda. There was definitely a better way for you to handle it. But at the same time they neglected their son and used their sick daughter as an excuse. They could've taken turns being there for him while the other stayed with you. Him blaming you and your health concerns does make him the AH but then again he feels he doesn't matter and since you are always the excuse it only makes sense that he'd blame you. I'd probably wait for things to calm down and try working things out as a family in counseling", "This. OP, I know you said your brother doesn't acknowledge you, but I would probably go to him and say, \"I know you're mad and you blame me for how everything is.
