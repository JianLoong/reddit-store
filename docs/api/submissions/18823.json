If she didn\u2019t want it to be brought up at work then she shouldn\u2019t have made her annoyance with you so obvious. If someone is being so dramatic that a supervisor notices their behavior and then asks about said behavior, it\u2019s not your fault. Maybe if you were antagonizing her or something, otherwise no.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t unprofessional. She was extremely unprofessional. And that\u2019s unsurprising since she\u2019s already on probation, presumably for being unprofessional.", "I N F O: Are your coworkers all 15-16 years old? This is ridiculous. You can't gatekeep who your ex dates. It's so juvenile! NTA", "NTA. \n\nAll you did is be honest about why she was treating you. Funny how she called you \"fake\" then got angry that you didn't \"fake\" a reason as to why she was treating you like crap.\n\n> When we were leaving she called me an asshole saying that I shouldnt have told the story and could have been vague and that Im unprofessional and that she could lose her job since shes already on probation. \n\nSounds like she may have had previous issues with treating other coworkers this way.", "NTA. You met the guy before knowing anything about his background, and you really liked him. I understand why his ex would be a little uncomfortable with you dating him, but you weren't really friends with them to begin with. So there's nothing wrong with choosing to continue to date him and distance yourselves from this group.\n\nYour coworker should be able to treat you cordially and professionally at work. Since she didn't do that, it's perfectly reasonable for you to tell your supervisor what was going on in the background. If she was already on probation and made things worse for herself by being rude to you at work, that's her own doing.", "NTA. If she throws someone under the bus like that she can't be mad when they tell the truth and stand up for themselves. It'd be one thing if she wanted to set boundaries until she got over the relationship, but she can't control who someone dates and she's petty af.", "Coworker is already on probation\u2026 *shocking*.\n\nAt least your boss isn\u2019t interested in petty social bickering in the off hours. NTA", "She chose not to be professional in the workplace. Not on you to cover that up or protect her. You've a right to expect people to behave professionally in your workplace, and once she tried to throw you under the bus, you were entitled and obligated to tell the truth. NTA", "NTA. Do not associate with people who tell you who you can't associate if they're...ya know...not violent or have other red flags. She's not over the guy, that's her problem to sort through and she didn't even try to go \"hey, we were together. Maybe don't bring him around\" or anything. She immediately told you that if you dated the dude you were out of the circle. That's manipulative bullshit. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA\n\nTypically if someone calls you the AH for telling the truth, it's almost always because they know they're the AH and they just don't want to be exposed.  I can't say if you made the right choice about the guy, but you definitely made the right choice about the toxic girl group.", "NTA obviously, hilarious that she actually thought you should lie for her after her behavior??", "NTA \nYou told the truth and, she's the one not being professional.  Not matter happens outside work, she doesn't have to be besties or anything but if she's acting rude enough to get your supervisor's attention then she's out of line.", "NTA-sounds like you have your answer. Co-worker who already gave you a stupid ultimatum now wanted you to lie so she doesn\u2019t get in trouble at work? You\u2019re not responsible for her behavior choices nor her keeping her job. Just say good morning to her each day, and leave it at that. She doesn\u2019t seem worth it. Too much drama and too immature.", "NTA - But you do have a choice to make.  Establish a new circle of friends that is probably going to be based around your new bf or drop the guy and get along at work.  This much I can tell you, if drama came that quick from a coworker, it will always be there.  Might not be the ex today, but maybe you wore the same dress to a company dinner party or sang her favorite song at karaoke. Stick with the guy and see where that ship takes you.", "NTA. Fingers crossed that she loses her job.  What a shit-show.  It sounds more like a jr. high cafeter\u00eda than a professional workplace.  I\u2019d cut my losses and stop socializing with the mean girls.\nThat said, 2 dates in 2 months and he wants to be exclusive?  Bit of a red flag for me\u2026well, maybe not red, but definitely yellow. \u26a0\ufe0f", "NTA. You're not going to be friends, so there's nothing to protect there. Protecting your job and professional reputation is more important. She made her own bed. Now she's going to get to spend more time in in, after she's fired.", "NTA. If the probation is due to previous misconduct the she may not be a coworker for long and you and the company will be better for that.", "> Im unprofessional and that she could lose her job since shes already on probation  \n  \nNTA - She could have chosen a different path but she chose to bring non-work drama into work, that's the unprofessional speaking right there. You did the right thing, she chose to be a petty and dare I say it, unprofessional. Something she is apparently versed in...", "NTA. First of all, they are broke up. She doesn't get to dictate who he dates. It doesn't matter if she isn't over him or not. This is high-school level maturity.\n\nAs far as her saying you shouldn't have told the full story - nope. If she didn't want the story told, then she shouldn't have done it. She certainly didn't do anything that would make you *want* to cover up for her.\n\nI can see why she is on probation. And, if she loses her job, it won't be because of you. It will be because of her own actions.", "NTA. Your coworker blew the situation out of proportion, and then brought the issue into the workplace. It\u2019s not your problem that she was unprofessional at work. It\u2019s also not your problem that she\u2019s already on probation. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong when you told your boss the truth.", "NTA, your coworker is petty af, rude, and unprofessional. If she loses her job it is because of her own choices and actions. But seriously, watch your back because I doubt she is going to let this situation go without trying to get some type of retribution.", "NTA you Dodged a bullet sounds like", "NTA. She tried to blame you after being unprofessional. You should tell the truth and stand up for yourself in that situation.", "NTA", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't do anything wrong and if she was already in trouble at work, she should propably be even more careful how she handles herself at work.", "Nta, you were professional. This is a her problem and you're lucky it happened or you would end up stuck in her friend group. At least this way you see her for the crazy she is.", "NTA. You didn't get her into trouble at work, she got herself into trouble. And apparently not for the first time.

I agree in this situation, but I\u2019ve found the truth teller has a 50/50 shot at being the AH.

You have to ask yourself three questions:\n\n1) Does it need to be said\n2) Does it need to be said by **ME**\n3) Does it need to be said by me **RIGHT NOW**\n\nIf the answer to any of those is no, just don\u2019t say it.
