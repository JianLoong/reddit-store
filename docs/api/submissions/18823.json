And that\u2019s unsurprising since she\u2019s already on probation, presumably for being unprofessional.", "I N F O: Are your coworkers all 15-16 years old? This is ridiculous. You can't gatekeep who your ex dates. It's so juvenile! NTA", "NTA. \n\nAll you did is be honest about why she was treating you.

You met the guy before knowing anything about his background, and you really liked him. I understand why his ex would be a little uncomfortable with you dating him, but you weren't really friends with them to begin with. So there's nothing wrong with choosing to continue to date him and distance yourselves from this group.\n\nYour coworker should be able to treat you cordially and professionally at work. Since she didn't do that, it's perfectly reasonable for you to tell your supervisor what was going on in the background. If she was already on probation and made things worse for herself by being rude to you at work, that's her own doing.", "NTA.

Do not associate with people who tell you who you can't associate if they're...ya know...not violent or have other red flags. She's not over the guy, that's her problem to sort through and she didn't even try to go \"hey, we were together. Maybe don't bring him around\" or anything. She immediately told you that if you dated the dude you were out of the circle. That's manipulative bullshit. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA\n\nTypically if someone calls you the AH for telling the truth, it's almost always because they know they're the AH and they just don't want to be exposed.

Co-worker who already gave you a stupid ultimatum now wanted you to lie so she doesn\u2019t get in trouble at work? You\u2019re not responsible for her behavior choices nor her keeping her job.

Establish a new circle of friends that is probably going to be based around your new bf or drop the guy and get along at work.

She doesn't get to dictate who he dates. It doesn't matter if she isn't over him or not. This is high-school level maturity.\n\nAs far as her saying you shouldn't have told the full story - nope. If she didn't want the story told, then she shouldn't have done it. She certainly didn't do anything that would make you *want* to cover up for her.\n\nI can see why she is on probation. And, if she loses her job, it won't be because of you. It will be because of her own actions.", "NTA. Your coworker blew the situation out of proportion, and then brought the issue into the workplace. It\u2019s not your problem that she was unprofessional at work.

Some places also use it when an employee has already been warned about previous poor behavior. Basically, coworker has already messed up before and is on thin ice at work.

You already have many commenters telling you that. \n\nI'm kind of curious about why your co-worker is/was on probation, though...", "Uh no, you\u2019re NTA. How old are these girls? /s \n\nI\u2019ve never ascribed to the \u201cyou can\u2019t date him because one of us did\u201d mentality. That\u2019s high school behavior. What kind of \u201ctrue friend group\u201d would that be when they don\u2019t know how to handle that kind of situation like adults. And then for her to want you to be vague and look like the person with the attitude is ridiculous. The fact that she\u2019s already on probation speaks volumes. This is a friend group you could do without.", "You're unprofessional? Talk about projection. NTA", "NTA this is directed at your coworker: Gurl, *you* brought the dirty laundry in and aired it out at work. Don\u2019t get pissy at OP for matching your energy, and your supervisor putting you in your place about how that\u2019s some petty ass BS.", "NTA if the guy didn't date you it would be someone else. This girl is a new friend and not someone you'll ending a long term deep friendship with. You'll make new friends", "Nta.\n\nBullet dodged. Those are Mean Girls! \n\nShe\u2019s already on probation is her issue not yours. And we can see why.", "... no, coworker didn't say she no longer wanted to be cordial. Coworker said OP chose to no longer be cordial with her. Coworker was trying to blame it on OP no longer being cordial with her. If she doesn't explain it becomes their word against each other. If she explains then it becomes obvious coworker is the one starting shit.", "Don't forget that the girl tried to throw OP under the bus first as well!", ">\u201cchose to no longer want to be cordial\u201d\n\nIn the co-worker's head that is synonymous with \"refused to let me dictate who she can date\".", "It would be easy enough to just ask \u201cHow\u2019s he doing now? We haven\u2019t seen him in ages!\u201d, or something. Almost anything other than bringing up a non-relationship, one this friend of an acquaintance has had almost a year to get over him. Why are they even still remotely interested in remembering him?", "In England it can also be both things.\nSource: I\u2019m English, and in England", "It seems like she was on some kind of formal write up process (tracking of disciplinary actions.)", "In England being on probation also means that you have been charged with a crime and been set a period of time to \u2018go straight\u2019 so if you commit another offence while on probation you could go straight to prison.", "It means both in the UK too", "That's interesting, I've lived all over the country and worked in HR for a while but never heard it used interchangeably with a warning. It's definitely not common use in terms of employment law here. Perhaps it's an idiosyncrasy of a certain area or sector I've not come across before. Thanks for the insight."]}
