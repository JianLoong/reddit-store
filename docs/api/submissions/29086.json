We began trying to conceive again after he turned 1, but were struggling with fertility issues. We had chosen the name \u201cSofia\u201d for the child we were trying to conceive if it were a girl. My mother in law became aware of this and bought several knick knacks and planted things in her garden for \u201csofia\u201d. \n\nNow that it has almost been a year since my husband passed, our friend came to me with news. He and his wife are expecting, and they want to name the baby after my husband if it\u2019s a boy and \u201cSofia\u201d if it\u2019s a girl. I didn\u2019t know how to react and was honored about them choosing my husbands name. I said yes, he\u2019d love that. My mother in law mentioned to him separately about the name being the same that we had chosen, as she was aware of our struggle. \n\nAfter thinking on it for the rest of that night and the next morning, I changed my mind. I thought more about how it would feel having to call their child either my late husbands name, or the name of a child I\u2019ll never get to bear. I also think it could be difficult for my son to call someone else by his father\u2019s name, which he knows, especially so fresh after the trauma. \n\nI messaged our friend and explained that after giving it more thought, I\u2019m honored but I think I would find it difficult for the above mentioned reasons. I offered his name be used as a middle name instead, for either sex. I apologized profusely, as being a mom myself, I fully understand how sensitive the name game can be. \n\nThey said they understand and will respect my wishes on not using my husbands name, but that they have only ever agreed on \u201cSofia\u201d. They apologized but said they will be using \u201cSofia\u201d if it is a girl, and that they hope I can find comfort in it. \n\nI appreciate that they respected my wishes on my husbands name, and I know it\u2019s not their fault that my husband is dead and that we struggled with fertility beforehand. I just can see myself struggling mentally to use this name for the rest of our friendship. \n\nThere is a very large group of us friends (16ish) that are all tight knit. I\u2019d like to not have this come between our friendship so I have to know - AITA for wanting these 2 names off limits?\n\nETA - the name is not \u201cSofia\u201d I changed it for anonymity. It is a popular name though so I do understand that concern.", "created_utc": 1697506711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179msms/aita_for_ruining_the_baby_names_chosen_by_my/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s hard to imagine now because the baby is so abstract but once it\u2019s someone who you can know you might feel differently", "I\u2019m sorry for you loss!! And it think it\u2019s reasonable to ask them not to use your husband\u2019s name, although they\u2019re free to. As far the girl name they have picked, I understand also how you feel about that but it comes down to you didn\u2019t get it use it unfortunately and that you don\u2019t own the name. I\u2019m sorry if that sounds harsh in anyway, that\u2019s the only way I could describe it. \n\nI\u2019d try not to let if affect the friendship but I could understand if it did. Idk if your in any kind of therapy for all that you\u2019ve gone though, but that could help. And if you are, address it with your therapist to help you cope through all the emotions that you\u2019re feeling. \n\nAnd you never know, they may change their mind, but brace yourself in case they don\u2019t. Again, I\u2019m sorry for your struggles and for the loss of your husband.", "I understand why you're upset but you have to remember that they weren't aware that you had chosen this name when they chose it. They only became aware when your mother in law told them. They obviously have their heart set on this name, so they're sticking to their guns.\n\nIt would be a shame to let this come between your friendship. It will take time for you to process but you will come around to it.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. That's really tough.", "NAH. you have my condolences. everyone here has been respectful towards each other. coming to the name \"Sofia\", you might eventually start warming upto the child. given that its a tight-knit group, you might even start loving her just as much, if they have a girl.", "They weren\u2019t seeking permission to name their daughter Sofia so I\u2019m not sure why you think it is yours to give, really. I don\u2019t really think YTA but i don\u2019t think you have any \u201cright\u201d to deny permission, so to speak", "YWBTA if you told them not to use Sophia. You can\u2019t claim that name and you never even had a child with it to begin with.", "You\u2019re being too hard an yourself OP, you didn\u2019t \u201cruin\u201d anything. There\u2019s just merit on both sides. \n\nReally sorry for your recent loss btw \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb so please, give yourself some leniency.", "I mean people can use any name that want. And they might change it. I see why you are upset tho.", "NAH. At the end of the day, you can't stop them, but it may impact your relationship. That's just how it goes. Hopefully not, but if it's too painful you don't have to martyr yourself for them.", "NAH\n\nOf course it's fair to not want to hear your partner's name regularly.\n\nBut.\n\nYou can't claim a name - esp for a child you didn't have.\n\nI think they are fair to still use it and it would be unfair to not work through it on your part.", "I'm so sorry for you loss. Unfortunately no one owns a name, I sure your son will come across other folks with the same name as your late husband, I doubt it would become a problem. And please don't hold it against your friends is they like the name Sophia. You have no way of knowing if the child you were trying for would have been a girl. Please don't ruin a friendship over this.", "YWBTA I think, at least for Sofia. It's an extremely popular name you can't just ban for everyone you know. You need to come to terms with hearing the same. Your MIL is an AH for butting in AFTER you said you would be honored.", "NAH if they didn't know that you intended to use that name for your own potential child (I'm not totally sure I'm interpreting this correctly). And you won't be wrong if they do end up having a daughter and you need time to come to terms with her name or even have to distance yourself from the friendship. It's just an unfortunate coincidence that this is coming when the pain must still be very raw for you.\n\nTime may offer you some healing but ultimately we all feel how we feel whether it's rational or it's been years or whatever, and all we can do sometimes is try to respond to those feelings in a way that is least hurtful to everyone involved. It was not wrong for you to think over your initial response and give your friends a more honest perspective on your feelings later on, and I hope that with similar mutual honesty and respect going into the future you will all at least be at peace with how things end up between you.", "YTA not for not wanting your husband\u2019s name used as a way to honor him. I can see why that would be painful and if these are good enough friends to want to honor your husband then they will understand that. \n\nBut, telling them to not use a name you selected for a non existent child is way out of line. Even if you had gotten pregnant, there was no guarantee of a girl. You have created this fantasy child it seems and your MIL created a garden to commemorate this fantasy child which only encouraged you to wallow in the fantasy.", "YTA only for claiming rights to a potential future daughter\u2019s name.  You had not conceived and if you did it might have been a boy.  You had a long journey ahead of you before the name ever came to fruition.  It\u2019s frankly bizarre your MIL became aware of what name you might use and started acting as if it was a fact.  People change their minds about what to name the baby regularly.  At this point, the name might be a poignant reminder of what might have been, just like the name I picked for my future daughter when I was 10 years old.  \n\nI am sorry for your loss and I\u2019m glad you have such thoughtful friends to support you.  And I do understand your feelings now.  I just don\u2019t think a name you might have used for a hoped for baby has near the attachment as the actual name of a loved one.", "YTA", "Sofia is a very quite common name, although I know in your anecdotal view, I can see how it hurts. \n\nNTA , but give yourself time, be honest with yourself, validate your feelings about it and maybe take some time from this group of friends if it gets that serious within you \n\nI wish you the best girlfriend", "YTA. You can\u2019t tell other people what to name their kid. Grow up.", "I think everyone has already handled things perfectly. What's the issue here?", "NTA and so so sorry for your loss. Losing a loved one is devastating. They have the right o use whatever name they wish though and you\u2019ve respectfully explained your point of view. If using \u201cSophia\u201d is difficult for you perhaps she can be given a nickname? Or call her by her middle name? I think eventually you will be able to see the child as their own self and not as the child your never had. I hope and pray for your healing.", "NAH, but in all fairness they can use whatever name they choose and you really don't have a say in their choice. As painful as it'll be for you, it's their child, and since they like the name they should be able to use it.\n\nI don't understand your do-or-die attitude toward having more children. You're still young, and you could find another great guy to spend your life with, so don't throw in the towel yet on the possibility of having another baby at some point, even with your fertility struggles. Never say never.", "NTA!\nAll I have to say is my heart hurts for you. I\u2019m sorry. I would never do that to a friend I care about.", "You\u2019re not the AH, neither are they. I think it was very respectful of them to lay off using your husband\u2019s name given the circumstances and your feelings, but the girl name is a name that was just something you were hoping to use someday; a day that never came and a child that never existed, It was only hypothetical. It is for this reason you should let it go. And I\u2019m sure it will get easier over the years to come as you see that little girl grow (if the child is born a girl). And, it would be my hope that soon the only Association that name will have for you is that little girl and not your husband or the little girl that you had hoped to have. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, sincerely.\u2764\ufe0f", "NAH no one asshole here. I understand you why you feel like this. But since it popular name so it can't be help that friend wants to name her child this.", "NAH. You feel how you feel and you can't help that. Your friends were very kind to approach you about their plans. That being said, you don't get to dictate what names they give their child. \n\nI hope you find peace with this. You have been through an awful tlime and I wish you all hte best.", "YTA. Its THEIR kid, you took away that special joy of naming their child what they want and made them feel guilty on it. It is very selfish.", "First and most importantly, I'm so sorry for your loss.  I can't even imagine.  This internet stranger is sending hugs and love.\n\nAnd NTA, especially because how tactfully you handled this.", "YTA", "Nah, I would see if they are comfortable with if you find an appropriate nickname if they have a girl.", "YTA - I can maybe understand the husband\u2019s name, but Sofia is just a name you liked but never used. It\u2019s not yours.", "I\u2019m sorry all of this is happening to you, that\u2019s a lot to deal with :( NTA; I think it\u2019s better for your friends to know how you feel about the whole situation, and I think it\u2019d be a little odd that they\u2019re so stuck on the girl name if they knew about what happened to you before they chose the name (and if they didn\u2019t know beforehand then I think it\u2019s a really unfortunate coincidence). I hope it all turns out ok!", "Nta- this is heartbreaking on all sides and I understand having your heart set on a name but my God is this sad. I'm trying to put myself I'm their shoes and I don't think I could forgive myself for hurting a friend like this.", "NTA and I would not keep them as friends", "YTA if you complain about the girls name, you don\u2019t even know if you\u2019d have a girl", "You are asking them to not use a name for a child that never existed. You seem like a reasonable person.", "First, condolences on the loss of your husband. \n\nYTA, but I'd say a soft one. They were understanding and agreed to not use your husband's name. Their use of Sophia is no slight to you, or dishonoring the memory of your loved one. You chose the name to represent the idea of a child who may or may not have entered your life had circumstances been different.", "You WBTA if you let the name come between you/burden your friendship. The girl name you choose is a popular one. Were it very unique, it would've been different.", "I dont know how to write this politely but thats not the only person who could potentially have his name? Or the girl name? Youre gunna hear it. You cant try to control what people do if you want but youll fail. \nAlso my mum just died pretty recently, someone having her name doesnt mean shit to me they aren't my mum??
