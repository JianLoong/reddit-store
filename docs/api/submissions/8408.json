Good job on getting the scholarship and have a great time in Europe. I\u2019d recommend the Netherlands.", "NTA. I'm saying this as a parent.  Our role as parents is to give our children the tools they need to fly the nest and build their own lives. That is our job. We shouldn't be doing it to expect a reward. You go and live your life.  You've worked hard for this and deserve every bit of it xx", "NTA\n\nLet me be clear here: You did NOTHING wrong.\n\nYour family is trying some disgusting gaslight guilttrip ultra-bullshit on you. They're extremely toxic that way. They want you to \"take care of them when they're old\" because you \"owe them for being alive\".\n\nWhy are they coming to you now? Cause your sibling has realized what I said above and is trying to get out of it by throwing you under the bus. My advice: Cut contact, go to Europe, stay there, get your master's and live a much happier life. \n\nMaybe advise your sister to just get the hell out of there and live her own life.

You will regret it forever.\n\nYour parents are supposed to be competent adults. Your sister is perfectly entitled to branch out and live her own life, if she so chooses. She is not entitled to make that decision for you.\n\nYou are at a very, very pivotal and consequential moment in your life. Move to Europe. You are in no way, shape or form an arsehole for putting your own interests first. You know what: sometimes it OK to be selfish. No one else is going to defend your own interest. I have never understood why \"living your best life\" is considered an accusation, rather than a complement. Life is not a dress rehearsal. You should life your best life, even others refuse to live theirs.\n\nYour parents' plan -- \"moving back to your \\[small\\] hometown and helping them with home duties\" -- is a path that will put you into servitude. Do you want to wake up when you are 50 and never have had a life, because you dedicated it to serving your parents?\n\nI am very big on honoring social obligations. But there is NO social obligation here. Children are SUPPOSED to leave the nest. It is OK to say \"no\" to unreasonable family requests. Make the full use of your God-given talents and move to Europe.\n\nYes, this will ruffle feathers.
