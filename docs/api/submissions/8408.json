That she had the burden of taking care of my parents and the home while I was living my best life and putting the burden on my parents. I was shocked and told her that I in no way put a burden on my parents. I did not ask them for money for anything and have been supporting myself since I got into university. My parents then told me that I should consider coming back home and starting working there and helping them out with home duties, to which I replied that I did not spend years working all day and all night to just go back to my hometown.

You will regret it forever.\n\nYour parents are supposed to be competent adults. Your sister is perfectly entitled to branch out and live her own life, if she so chooses. She is not entitled to make that decision for you.\n\nYou are at a very, very pivotal and consequential moment in your life. Move to Europe. You are in no way, shape or form an arsehole for putting your own interests first. You know what: sometimes it OK to be selfish. No one else is going to defend your own interest. I have never understood why \"living your best life\" is considered an accusation, rather than a complement. Life is not a dress rehearsal. You should life your best life, even others refuse to live theirs.\n\nYour parents' plan -- \"moving back to your \\[small\\] hometown and helping them with home duties\" -- is a path that will put you into servitude. Do you want to wake up when you are 50 and never have had a life, because you dedicated it to serving your parents?\n\nI am very big on honoring social obligations. But there is NO social obligation here. Children are SUPPOSED to leave the nest. It is OK to say \"no\" to unreasonable family requests.

We are taking out funeral plans. This is our responsibility to sort out, not our kids. One is in education abroad,  the other works a couple hours away.

They don't want a world outside of their bubble, and feel that anyone choosing to investigate the outside is splitting which is a personal betrayal. Inside their bubble is their safety blanket - of which their town is a major part to which they are very attached. Anyone choosing to live elsewhere is obviously mad because what could be better than the small town they love? And of course, if you leave the bubble how can you be their carers in old age? That's why they are attacking you by putting words in your mouth. They have lost control over you and are trying to coerce you to come back back into their bubble.\n\nPlease don't feel horrible - you have nothing to feel horrible for. Your parents should be proud of a daughter studying for a Masters.  Any normal parents would. So don't let their abnormal reaction determine your emotions. \n\nI don't think what you said was particularly bad.

If she spend the next 20 years taking them to doctors appointments etc. you can't swoop in and claim half their estates in the end.  The cost of somebody caring for your parents isn't hers to bear fully just because you can say 'No' and she can't.

Your parents should plan their resources better and can manage their own house chores. You are under no obligation to take care of them.", "Also want to add. Don't let them make you feel guilty. And after you finish master, if you feel like, you can help them monetarily. But if you go back now, it will harm your career and they will hold you back and it will cause resentment. Family that holds you back is not a supporting family but a selfish one.\n\nMy dad was forced to move back home leaving his job even though he sent money regularly.

Because societal pressure. JFC it\u2019s not just societal pressure because she is being asked to help. Get your head out of your ass. She\u2019s NTA but you sure are with your comment."]}
