Backstory: My girlfriend (31) and I (33) have been dating for 5 years, living together for almost 3 now. 2 months ago we adopted a rescue dog, we love the dog and having him has been amazing so far except for one small problem: The dog developed extreme attachment to my girlfriend and won't let her out of sight even for a minute. This is not a big problem since work is flexible and we have made it work, however, our intimate time has taken a deep hit since we can never close the door of our bedroom without our doggy loudly howling and crying. We are working on this separation anxiety separately and hopefully it will get better on time. Lately we joked about how we can't remember the last time we had sex and how we will never having private time ever again. All for good laughs. Last week while browsing a website that lists discounted products and special promotions, I stumbled upon a great deal at a fancy hotel in our city, 10 minutes walking distance from our place. I immediately thought about her and booked the hotel and a table for dinner as well, thinking about it as a nice way to enjoy a casual date night and provide us with some space for us to be alone. I also made arrangements for a friend of ours to stay home with our puppy. After all the arrangements were done, I sent her a flirty message with the details of my plan, however, her answer was way different to what I expected.\n\nShe called me immediately and yelled at me. In her words, she was furious that I booked everything without asking her first and disappointed that after so long time of being together I would believe she would be happy about such a plan. Also a waste of money and a stupid thing to do given we live in the same city.\n\nIt's been now a couple of days and she's still angry at me and I feel a deep void inside, I never expected this kind of reaction and started to consider I did something outrageous.

It is *her* reaction that is inexplicable. WHY would she say she'd never be OK with it? It's not like you were going to abandon the dog, you found a sittter for the dog to keep it company.\n\n>I feel a deep void inside\n\nListen to that feeling. She rejected you. She rejected you emotionally, romantically, and sexually, in a cruel way, and she is blaming YOU for it. There is no coming back from this. Your relationship is over now, now she got this dog. Now she is prioritising this dog over you. You have been *replaced*. Plan your future accordingly.

NTA at all, you were trying to do something nice...  you payed, made all proper arrangements, and even got someone to sit the dog. Maybe she is the one who has separation anxiety from the dog.", "NTA. That's a very ungrateful response to what sounds like a well thought out surprise. This reaction over a dog? Look, I love animals as much as the next person but you can't spend your whole life catering for them. Being around your pets too much is not good for them, they never learn independence. You would be well within your rights to discuss how disappointed you are with her reaction.", "No, you're not an asshole. I do think if this relationship is going to work though that the communication pattern needs to change. Is this how it normally goes down when you have a conflict?", "I would say NTA, simply for the intended gesture. It's not clear from your post, but you probably ought to have mentioned that the dog is a big factor in your romantic getaway idea. Bummer that your partner wasn't receptive to a surprise like that. Perhaps if you had used a shared bank account to purchase the hotel stay, I'd be more understanding of your partner's response, but if it was with your own money, tbh I don't see a problem.\n\nMaybe when you bring up your disappointment with her reaction, you can reiterate how you felt like the hotel stay would be a good way to get some privacy. And why your gf assumes you would \"know by now\" that she wouldn't be into that type of thing.

It sounds like a nice gesture if the person receiving the time away actually wants it.  She might love the bonding and unconditional love she\u2019s getting from the dog. \nShe might feel you want the hotel for sex only which could make her feel cheap. \nThe intimacy level will take a dive anytime you bring in someone that can\u2019t take care of themselves but it comes back. This happens when you have kids too. \nI wouldn\u2019t say you are an AH but more uninformed of her needs. She\u2019s allowed to not want to go to a hotel room too.

In these situations, the partner (usually a woman) is portrayed as being overjoyed that their partner whisks them away. \n\nBut IRL people are complicated. They have their own crutches to get through life, and their own perceptions about other peoples intentions. Even something that one person thinks is only a nice gesture can be interpreted differently. \n\nThe way to avoid this: talking. Suggest that you could share a night in a hotel, and the suggestion itself can be fun a flirty. She might say yes, she might say no. But she\u2019s a part of the choice. The spontaneous act can impose a pressure through social cues, meaning she feels like she has to go ahead or upset you. This is especially fraught around sex. No one wants to feel \u201cpeer pressure\u201d into sex by their partner, whether intentional or not. \n\nSo I\u2019ll say NTA.

Crates are not cruel. They are great for insecure dogs.

They've always done what they like and expect me to as well.\n\nBut I would totally love a hypothetical discussion of \"what if we could go to Ireland, what would we do?\"  :D", "Except the reason she said she was mad was because she couldn\u2019t believe that after so long he would think she would like such a plan being made without input. He also seems surprised by her reaction though.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t tell if this is a case of her not liking surprises like this and him being oblivious to that for years and her getting mad because she believes that after so many years he should KNOW she hates surprises or if she actually is the type to usually like surprises and this this truly did come out of utter nowhere and against character meaning something else is going on. I\u2019d lean towards the first situation simply because that is the one in which her reaction makes the most sense, but it could still be the other.", "Or she could be expected to have her period that day and so doesn't want to be intimate that day. Or that whole separation anxiety thing and her being gone might make it worse. I mean they can't even shut the door yet. I always hated the surprise hotel room dates because sex was expected and I didn't always feel up to it.", "Completely disagree. Sexual desire isn\u2019t just a physical thing, it\u2019s very much a mental thing too", "I disagree. A conversation can be helpful in identifying why the girlfriend responded the way she did. There's a world of difference between, \"I felt like you were pressuring me to go to a hotel and have sex with you and that made me uncomfortable,\" and, \"I've lost interest in you and I no longer want to have sex with you at all.\"\n\nHaving a conversation like adults where both the OP and his girlfriend are honest about their emotions and their desires is the first step to either fixing the relationship or figuring out if it's time for the relationship to end.", "yeah but she didn't need to yell at him, OP doesn't read minds and theyre allowed to be upset for her reaction", "I might have before I had better coping methods for my anxiety and PTSD. Those coping strategies took a lot of work to come up with and are not always reliable. I would expect my partner to understand how I don\u2019t do well with surprises and why and would be pretty disappointed if he still threw something like this at me then expected me to be happy.", "We know more information is better but Op is not the one who is stonewalling here. It's been a couple of days already and Op has no new information outside of she didn't like the plan and he should know her by now...i.e. it's your fault you are confused. That's a stonewalling tactic. We are putting words in her mouth because we are in the same position as Op, bewildered confusion.  I sense an strong power imbalance between the two (sex centered probably) especially if Op doesn't know what he's apologizing for.", "That makes sense with anxiety and PTSD.  OP didn\u2019t mention anything like that so her reaction seems over the top to me, but your case is a bit different.  I personally also have issues with the \u201cwe have been together for x years you should know\u201d because what is sometimes so obvious to one partner is not always obvious to the other.  I have had discussions about statements like these in my relationship and it always seems better to not say this and make clear why something is or is not ok.  We have so many interactions with our partners that sometimes feelings can change or intentions get crossed.", "Nta.  My wife and I live just outside a major city and have done a date night with a hotel downtown.  We have 4 kids.", "Nta. That\u2019s a weird reaction", "NTA in the SLIGHTEST... wow", "NTA- this was a really sweet, thoughtful, and well planned surprise that should have been well received. Worse case maybe postponed due to a scheduling conflict if that was her issue. I don\u2019t see a world where this would be met with hostility.", "NTA, it certainly looks like she's using the dog as an excuse to not be intimate with you at all! If anyone is being dishonest or undermining the other it's her!", "You should talk to her and understand what the hell happened \ud83d\ude33\nIt doesn't seem like a normal reaction... But again, we don't know her. Does she hate surprises? \n\nNTA", "This kind of planning is what mom\u2019s wish their husbands would do once in awhile. Book a date, arrange a babysitter. It\u2019s so sweet and caring. I cannot imagine getting angry about that. You did nothing wrong NTA", "NAH- you had good intentions but from now on you need to understand that a lot of people I actually really hate surprises like that. You absolutely shouldn\u2019t book getaways without talking to your significant other, it doesn\u2019t matter if you make good money and you\u2019re paying for it. I would never do that to my husband and he would never do that to me, we need to be on the same page about things and plan. A lot of people really hate surprises and that\u2019s totally valid. \n\nAlso, just fuck with the dog in the room? Plenty of couples have dogs that never leave them alone. Have you taken the dog to the vet and talked about anxiety medication? There are long term options here", "Train your dog", "Erm.... No one else has asked.... Could it be a \"time of the month\" issue? I know I'd be upset if the hubs tried to do something romantic for me but didn't check with me for scheduling and I had to miss out!", "NTA She should had been nicer about it. He probably will feel stump about any other acts of endearment from now on", "My hubby and I love this kind of date night/minor staycation. It's a great break from life.\n\neta, NTA.  You should probably get a trainer for the dog before he rules your life completely", "NTA\n\npersonally, i'd go on a solo dinner.  stay in the hotel room and order room service.", "Ouch. NTA. This is an extreme reaction and then to still be pissed 2 days later, kind of think there must be more to it and it can\u2019t just be this.", "NTA- that was really sweet. I wonder what\u2019s up with her?", "YNTA  -  She totally is. \n\nI found this loveable and you need to find overnight doggy day care vs a friend who your dog will hate by association and might be aggressive toward next time.\n\nWhat is wrong with her? She likes the dog more? Might need to rethink this relationship as she will not rethink the dog.", "NTA but it\u2019s not healthy to sacrifice your relationship to foster a pet. You deserve to be prioritized by your partner.", "NTA at all. Have you tried sitting down and asking where the reaction came from? If there's no reason then I'd wonder if the relationship is worth keeping. I wish I could do stuff like this for my wife. I can't really think of a reason to blow up like that over a date night. And I don't think it's the spontaneous aspect. I'd imagine OP would know after all the time together if she didn't like that sort of thing", "NTA. This is a classic example of damned if you do, damned if you don't. I'd be concerned as to why she would get so upset with you for planning a quiet dinner and overnight stay in a hotel 10 minutes away from your apartment. Did your plan interrupt her work schedule or other plans you didn't know about? Or ie she just pissed because you didn't have her \"permission\" to plan something nice.\n\nAt this point, you have a right to be petty. Keep the reservation, pack a bag , and go to the hotel without her.. Eat, drink, and enjoy yourself. Don't call or text. Let her call YOU. Because it's not what you're doing, it's what she thinks you're doing. Just let her imagination run wild. Go back home like nothing happened and don't apologize. If a conversation takes place later, be respectful but don't sugar coat how she made you feel.\n\nIf she", "NTA. Get a trainer for the dog. Train it to go to bed at certain times at night so you can get the privacy you need. I don\u2019t think you are TA for preparing a surprise for your partner, it\u2019s a shame that she prioritised the dog over you. \n\nMy partner is really attached to our dog and our dog is the needy one. However he knows to prioritise and discipline when needed.", "NTA\n\n\nPlease update when possible", "Wow I would have loved that. The spontaneous of it all. O.o what's her problem.... nta", "Hmmm...who has the separation anxiety again...?\n\nNTA\n\nSounds like there's something else going on in your relationship.  Maybe that should be the discussion you have with your GF.", "It sounds like you had a great idea to reconnect in a fun way. If it\u2019s so close to home you didn\u2019t even have to spend the night if she was worried about the puppy being alone. Tell her how you\u2019re feeling, and ask why she had such a strong response. Without communication there\u2019s no relationship (even when the communication is about shitty things).", "Absolutely agree. So many people on this thread completely sure they know whats going on. None of us do. There's nowhere near enough detail in the OP to know whats going on (and only one comment from OP from what I can see).\n\nWe don't even know *why* GF is upset. \n\n> In her words, she was furious that I booked everything without asking her first and disappointed that after so long time of being together I would believe she would be happy about such a plan. Also a waste of money and a stupid thing to do given we live in the same city.\n\nThis is it. This is all we know. Is she upset about OP organising **anything** without asking first? Is she upset because she doesn't like surprises? Is she upset because she thinks booking a whole hotel room down the road from where they live is overkill? Is she more worried about money than OP is? Is it about leaving the dog alone? Does she just not want to have sex with OP? Does she feel like OP only cares about sex and is going to extraordinary lengths to get some?\n\nWe have no idea what her real issue is, and it sounds like neither does OP, and the only way he's going to find out is to have a conversation.", "OK, OP before you listen to this person and blow up your relationship, how about you TALK to your GF and ask her to explain where this is coming from? What are her concerns? \n\nBecause this does not have to end your relationship, but without clear communication it makes it more likely. Personally I am not someone that likes surprises or someone assuming they know my schedule, or making plans for my dog without me. So maybe it isn't that she doesn't want the date, but more about being left out of the loop. \n\nBut there is only one way to find out, ya gotta talk to her!", "this comment is wildly extreme for the limited information OP gave", "Exactly this!! Time to leave and consider your future away from this relationship. The dog is being allowed to get away with shit and his behavior is only going to get worse.\nPlease move on with your life and you deserve to be happy..", "THIS \\^\\^\\^", "Lumping a baby into the same category though??", "Saying the relationship is dead and irredeemable over this when we know very little about these people is a major overreaction and isn't helping anything.", "People who can\u2019t afford to travel sometimes just want a night away from home. It depends on the person.", "If I could upvote this more than once I would. How does she go shopping, to appointments, out with friends? Does the dog go everywhere with her?", "At the same time, they don\u2019t have sex because of a dog making a noise in the other room? There has to be more going on. Sounds like she might be more of an asexual and not realize it while OP is not.", "Right? Pretty sure our dog is in her bed next to our bed every time we\u2019ve ever fucked and never even realized. It\u2019s not that serious", "He didn't spring it on her at dinner he gave a few days notice. If she really wasn't up for it she didn't have to go nuclear.  A simple no thanks, not this time would be sufficient.", "Right, but would you get pissed and start yelling?", "Oh come on, they're dating for five years, even if they wouldn't have sex, they would have finally a romantic date and a night with cuddling without a dog constantly howling. \n\nEven if she didn't want that, she could have declined politely, but she was super nasty and guilt tripping over a nice gesture. \n\nNTA OP", "The expectation of \u2018hey i booked a hotel not for us to relax and get away from a dog that we are struggling with, but because i feel like i\u2019m not getting laid enough\u2019 \n\nSome people are freaked out about hotels\n\nSome people don\u2019t like surprises in any form, even if it is something they would ordinarily enjoy", "yeah - and maybe the dog attitude is enabled by the wife to 'discretely' avoid sexual contact (edit : NTA)", "I have an excel spreadsheet of our potential future trips, time of year to go, where to stay, restaurants to try, activities to do, plus the rough approximations of the costs. \n\nThey all stemmed from those type of conversations!", "I think you are spot on r/DeadBedrooms", "No disagreement but if your partner dosn't want it (and wants the dog instead) then you're 90% done.", "I get what you're saying but I think in that case he should have talked to her about it beforehand."]}
