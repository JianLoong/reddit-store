Last week while browsing a website that lists discounted products and special promotions, I stumbled upon a great deal at a fancy hotel in our city, 10 minutes walking distance from our place. I immediately thought about her and booked the hotel and a table for dinner as well, thinking about it as a nice way to enjoy a casual date night and provide us with some space for us to be alone.

It is *her* reaction that is inexplicable. WHY would she say she'd never be OK with it? It's not like you were going to abandon the dog, you found a sittter for the dog to keep it company.\n\n>I feel a deep void inside\n\nListen to that feeling. She rejected you. She rejected you emotionally, romantically, and sexually, in a cruel way, and she is blaming YOU for it. There is no coming back from this. Your relationship is over now, now she got this dog. Now she is prioritising this dog over you. You have been *replaced*. Plan your future accordingly. If you stay with her, and (god help you) she ever has a baby, the same shit will happen all over again.  \n\n\nNTA btw, NTA at all.", "wtf?  NTA at all, you were trying to do something nice...  you payed, made all proper arrangements, and even got someone to sit the dog. Maybe she is the one who has separation anxiety from the dog.", "NTA. That's a very ungrateful response to what sounds like a well thought out surprise. This reaction over a dog? Look, I love animals as much as the next person but you can't spend your whole life catering for them. Being around your pets too much is not good for them, they never learn independence. You would be well within your rights to discuss how disappointed you are with her reaction.", "No, you're not an asshole. I do think if this relationship is going to work though that the communication pattern needs to change. Is this how it normally goes down when you have a conflict?", "I would say NTA, simply for the intended gesture. It's not clear from your post, but you probably ought to have mentioned that the dog is a big factor in your romantic getaway idea. Bummer that your partner wasn't receptive to a surprise like that. Perhaps if you had used a shared bank account to purchase the hotel stay, I'd be more understanding of your partner's response, but if it was with your own money, tbh I don't see a problem.\n\nMaybe when you bring up your disappointment with her reaction, you can reiterate how you felt like the hotel stay would be a good way to get some privacy. And why your gf assumes you would \"know by now\" that she wouldn't be into that type of thing. NGL the guessing game annoys tf outta me, I need things spelled out for me at times.", "NTA but your gf is and didn't show any appreciation for the thought you put into this", "Alright uhhh NAH. She\u2019s not wrong\u2026after dating her for this long you didn\u2019t realize this isn\u2019t something she would want? I\u2019d also be a little miffed if my partner wasted money on a hotel room in the same city we live in. I, personally, (and maybe your GF too) think that\u2019s pretty dumb. \n\nThat being said, I guess you were trying to do something nice it just didn\u2019t land. Doesn\u2019t make you an AH, just a little ignorant to your relationship.", "NTA that\u2019s a really sweet and thoughtful date night. Stay cations are fun. I would find out what is actually bothering her. Does she never like surprises? Does she not want to be intimate with you? Is she financially stressed out?", "Get out of this relationship asap OP you're in a dead bedroom and it doesn't improve with time, whatever the excuse (dog, kids etc.), unless you're both on the same page intimacy wise one of you is going to be unhappy, if you're not married and don't have kids time to break up", "ESH you need to hire a trainer for the dog, you can't continue living the way you are now", "NTA\n\n> Lately we joked about how we can't remember the last time we had sex and how we will never having private time ever again.

Talk about this with her. There is an issue here and it's either about the dog or about sex.", "Did you girlfriend mention she wanted a hotel away from the dog? It sounds like a nice gesture if the person receiving the time away actually wants it.  She might love the bonding and unconditional love she\u2019s getting from the dog. \nShe might feel you want the hotel for sex only which could make her feel cheap. \nThe intimacy level will take a dive anytime you bring in someone that can\u2019t take care of themselves but it comes back. This happens when you have kids too. \nI wouldn\u2019t say you are an AH but more uninformed of her needs. She\u2019s allowed to not want to go to a hotel room too. Y\u2019all have been together long enough to communicate these things to each other. \nIf you don\u2019t want to have sex in front of the dog, do it in shower. I can assure you most dogs don\u2019t care about humans having sex in front of them but understand if you don\u2019t want to.", "[deleted]", "Staying in a hotel so close to home is a huge waste of money. Not knowing your financials of how much you spent on this night.  It's hard to say. \n\nBut since you have been together for 5 years now.

In these situations, the partner (usually a woman) is portrayed as being overjoyed that their partner whisks them away. \n\nBut IRL people are complicated. They have their own crutches to get through life, and their own perceptions about other peoples intentions. Even something that one person thinks is only a nice gesture can be interpreted differently. \n\nThe way to avoid this: talking. Suggest that you could share a night in a hotel, and the suggestion itself can be fun a flirty. She might say yes, she might say no. But she\u2019s a part of the choice. The spontaneous act can impose a pressure through social cues, meaning she feels like she has to go ahead or upset you. This is especially fraught around sex. No one wants to feel \u201cpeer pressure\u201d into sex by their partner, whether intentional or not. \n\nSo I\u2019ll say NTA.
