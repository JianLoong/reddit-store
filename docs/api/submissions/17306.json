Backstory: My girlfriend (31) and I (33) have been dating for 5 years, living together for almost 3 now. 2 months ago we adopted a rescue dog, we love the dog and having him has been amazing so far except for one small problem: The dog developed extreme attachment to my girlfriend and won't let her out of sight even for a minute. This is not a big problem since work is flexible and we have made it work, however, our intimate time has taken a deep hit since we can never close the door of our bedroom without our doggy loudly howling and crying. We are working on this separation anxiety separately and hopefully it will get better on time. Lately we joked about how we can't remember the last time we had sex and how we will never having private time ever again. All for good laughs. Last week while browsing a website that lists discounted products and special promotions, I stumbled upon a great deal at a fancy hotel in our city, 10 minutes walking distance from our place. I immediately thought about her and booked the hotel and a table for dinner as well, thinking about it as a nice way to enjoy a casual date night and provide us with some space for us to be alone. I also made arrangements for a friend of ours to stay home with our puppy. After all the arrangements were done, I sent her a flirty message with the details of my plan, however, her answer was way different to what I expected.\n\nShe called me immediately and yelled at me. In her words, she was furious that I booked everything without asking her first and disappointed that after so long time of being together I would believe she would be happy about such a plan. Also a waste of money and a stupid thing to do given we live in the same city.\n\nIt's been now a couple of days and she's still angry at me and I feel a deep void inside, I never expected this kind of reaction and started to consider I did something outrageous. I apologized already and cancelled the whole ordeal, however, I can't stop thinking about it and haven't been able to sleep since.\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit to answers some questions: \n\n-We both have great salaries and spend this kind of money on regular days for dinner. \n\n-She has mentioned a few times that she wishes we were able to have sex and cuddle comfortably without worrying about the dog.\n\n-We have to close the door because if the dog is in the room, he jumps in bed every time, it's not about him just watching us doing it.", "created_utc": 1684160295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i9nuc/aita_for_booking_a_hotel_room_as_part_of_a_date/", "score": 1542, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is *her* reaction that is inexplicable. WHY would she say she'd never be OK with it? It's not like you were going to abandon the dog, you found a sittter for the dog to keep it company.\n\n>I feel a deep void inside\n\nListen to that feeling. She rejected you. She rejected you emotionally, romantically, and sexually, in a cruel way, and she is blaming YOU for it. There is no coming back from this. Your relationship is over now, now she got this dog. Now she is prioritising this dog over you. You have been *replaced*. Plan your future accordingly.

NTA at all, you were trying to do something nice...  you payed, made all proper arrangements, and even got someone to sit the dog. Maybe she is the one who has separation anxiety from the dog.", "NTA. That's a very ungrateful response to what sounds like a well thought out surprise. This reaction over a dog? Look, I love animals as much as the next person but you can't spend your whole life catering for them. Being around your pets too much is not good for them, they never learn independence. You would be well within your rights to discuss how disappointed you are with her reaction.", "No, you're not an asshole. I do think if this relationship is going to work though that the communication pattern needs to change. Is this how it normally goes down when you have a conflict?", "I would say NTA, simply for the intended gesture. It's not clear from your post, but you probably ought to have mentioned that the dog is a big factor in your romantic getaway idea. Bummer that your partner wasn't receptive to a surprise like that. Perhaps if you had used a shared bank account to purchase the hotel stay, I'd be more understanding of your partner's response, but if it was with your own money, tbh I don't see a problem.\n\nMaybe when you bring up your disappointment with her reaction, you can reiterate how you felt like the hotel stay would be a good way to get some privacy. And why your gf assumes you would \"know by now\" that she wouldn't be into that type of thing.

In these situations, the partner (usually a woman) is portrayed as being overjoyed that their partner whisks them away. \n\nBut IRL people are complicated. They have their own crutches to get through life, and their own perceptions about other peoples intentions. Even something that one person thinks is only a nice gesture can be interpreted differently. \n\nThe way to avoid this: talking. Suggest that you could share a night in a hotel, and the suggestion itself can be fun a flirty. She might say yes, she might say no. But she\u2019s a part of the choice. The spontaneous act can impose a pressure through social cues, meaning she feels like she has to go ahead or upset you. This is especially fraught around sex. No one wants to feel \u201cpeer pressure\u201d into sex by their partner, whether intentional or not. \n\nSo I\u2019ll say NTA.

Crates are not cruel. They are great for insecure dogs.

He also seems surprised by her reaction though.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t tell if this is a case of her not liking surprises like this and him being oblivious to that for years and her getting mad because she believes that after so many years he should KNOW she hates surprises or if she actually is the type to usually like surprises and this this truly did come out of utter nowhere and against character meaning something else is going on. I\u2019d lean towards the first situation simply because that is the one in which her reaction makes the most sense, but it could still be the other.", "Or she could be expected to have her period that day and so doesn't want to be intimate that day. Or that whole separation anxiety thing and her being gone might make it worse. I mean they can't even shut the door yet. I always hated the surprise hotel room dates because sex was expected and I didn't always feel up to it.", "Completely disagree. Sexual desire isn\u2019t just a physical thing, it\u2019s very much a mental thing too", "I disagree. A conversation can be helpful in identifying why the girlfriend responded the way she did.

Those coping strategies took a lot of work to come up with and are not always reliable.

It's been a couple of days already and Op has no new information outside of she didn't like the plan and he should know her by now...i.e. it's your fault you are confused. That's a stonewalling tactic. We are putting words in her mouth because we are in the same position as Op, bewildered confusion.  I sense an strong power imbalance between the two (sex centered probably) especially if Op doesn't know what he's apologizing for.", "That makes sense with anxiety and PTSD.  OP didn\u2019t mention anything like that so her reaction seems over the top to me, but your case is a bit different.  I personally also have issues with the \u201cwe have been together for x years you should know\u201d because what is sometimes so obvious to one partner is not always obvious to the other.  I have had discussions about statements like these in my relationship and it always seems better to not say this and make clear why something is or is not ok.

Worse case maybe postponed due to a scheduling conflict if that was her issue.

I would never do that to my husband and he would never do that to me, we need to be on the same page about things and plan.

You deserve to be prioritized by your partner.", "NTA at all. Have you tried sitting down and asking where the reaction came from? If there's no reason then I'd wonder if the relationship is worth keeping. I wish I could do stuff like this for my wife. I can't really think of a reason to blow up like that over a date night.

Or ie she just pissed because you didn't have her \"permission\" to plan something nice.\n\nAt this point, you have a right to be petty. Keep the reservation, pack a bag , and go to the hotel without her.. Eat, drink, and enjoy yourself. Don't call or text. Let her call YOU. Because it's not what you're doing, it's what she thinks you're doing. Just let her imagination run wild. Go back home like nothing happened and don't apologize.

Also a waste of money and a stupid thing to do given we live in the same city.\n\nThis is it. This is all we know. Is she upset about OP organising **anything** without asking first? Is she upset because she doesn't like surprises? Is she upset because she thinks booking a whole hotel room down the road from where they live is overkill? Is she more worried about money than OP is? Is it about leaving the dog alone? Does she just not want to have sex with OP? Does she feel like OP only cares about sex and is going to extraordinary lengths to get some?\n\nWe have no idea what her real issue is, and it sounds like neither does OP, and the only way he's going to find out is to have a conversation.", "OK, OP before you listen to this person and blow up your relationship, how about you TALK to your GF and ask her to explain where this is coming from? What are her concerns? \n\nBecause this does not have to end your relationship, but without clear communication it makes it more likely. Personally I am not someone that likes surprises or someone assuming they know my schedule, or making plans for my dog without me. So maybe it isn't that she doesn't want the date, but more about being left out of the loop. \n\nBut there is only one way to find out, ya gotta talk to her!", "this comment is wildly extreme for the limited information OP gave", "Exactly this!!

Like others have said, it\u2019s time for the OP to start looking at getting out of this relationship. This is way deeper than the situation with the dog.

Honestly it\u2019s like an extreme overreaction. \n\nNTA at all. What you did was thoughtful and consciously considered your furry friend too.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think that your gf is either.

Did you ask her if she wants to make a sex date? Does she have a choice of whether or not she is having sex on this date? Do you see what I\u2019m getting at?\n\nSure, in general she says she wishes she could cuddle more and have more intimacy, etc. But it sounds like you\u2019ve 100% removed her from the decision making process and literally booked a hotel room to have sex with her. \n\nAs much as I love intimacy with my hubs, he sure as hell isn\u2019t going to schedule it for me.", "All these comments saying how Romantic your plans were but all it screams to me is \"I WANT SEX\".

I\u2019m sorry she didn\u2019t appreciate it.", "NTA but her reaction was batshit crazy. That's so not about the money. I can see her getting upset about the surprise of it if she doesn't enjoy surprise romantic date nights. It honestly looks like she chose the dog over you. Yall need a talk and if that doesn't get to the root of the problem, then couples counseling with a professional.", "NTA But it sounds like her reaction may have been a little foreseeable. Bringing out of as an issue her dysfunctional level of attachment to the dog will be a first step in addressing what is driving it.", "Her reaction does not seem to match the situation. Based off the info you provided, NTA, but something is off.", "Something is going on with your girlfriend causing her to avoid intimacy. The dog is an excuse. This plan eluded the excuse and that's why she had a terrible reaction.

She talked about not being included in the HUGE SHOCKING PLAN of a night in a local hotel for their date night. The disproportionality is so glaring that she is obviously engaging in transference of some kind. Could be about sex, could be about the dog.

A people pleaser would swallow their objections, paint on a big smile and go pretend to enjoy the surprise they didn't want. They would suffer through their anxiety in silence. Gently telling somebody that you are upset and asking for room to process it is just a normal, healthy response.

That would explain this dramatic overreaction as being defensive when now feeling pressured to do something she actually didn't want to do but thought she had safely lied about wanting to do. I'm not saying girlfriend is an asshole for not wanting sex, but she's an asshole for lying about it and then yelling at OP for believing her lies. And I get this topic can be hard for people to talk about, still dosen't make her treating him this way okay.

I can\u2019t even condemn the relationship like Reddit usually does because i literally can\u2019t even understand what the fuck her problem is. All i know is NTA.", "LASTLY, i would have LONG broken up if every time i wanna fuck the dog jumps in the goddamn bed. FUCK YOUR DOG THEN WEIRDO. IM SORRY.", "NAH. There's a lot that could be going on here. She could be on her period that date night, or secretly stressed about fertility (that happens in your 30s for sure), or feeling like you've essentially paid money to definitely have sex from her without her ability to go with the flow naturally. Or like some other reactionary people are saying, something totally bad, she's cheating on you with the dog, whatever salacious thing you want to imagine. The point is, you'll have to have a conversation about this since it seems like this (hopefully) sincere gesture brought out the worst for both of you.", "NTA. Although if you want to do a surprise with these things try to do it on a public holiday or something. It can be tricky doing something that you weren\u2019t expecting to do that day. Even then, it may not be the best approach and you just have to know your girlfriend.\n\nOtherwise, you just ask in advance, and let the surprise be what you set up for her, instead of the surprise that you are doing something for her, if that makes sense.\n\nPlease explain your feeling to her, and hers to yours. As others have said, more communication :)", "After she calmed down, did you ask her why she was so angry ? I\u2019d be curious to hear her true answer based on some of things you added to the post.", "I wont tell you to leave your gf, but what I will tell you is that you choose what you want your life to look like.\n\nDo you want to always be in second place to your dog?\nDo you want to be in a relationship with a person who seems to be all talk and no action when it comes to sex?\n\nNTA", "NAH.\n\nTbh, it would\u2019ve been better if you had communicated this to her, because even though surprises aren\u2019t agitating for some, others can feel mounds of pressure, especially if they have a lot going on and just leaving everything to the sidelines can cause a great heap of anxiety.\n\nThat being said though, her reaction was rather extreme and uncalled for, especially with what\u2019s being said in the edits. You should talk to her, and find out why she reacted the way she did.", "NTA, and you need a new girlfriend. I got at a luxury hotel for a couple of days 45minutes from where I live! It was fun and worth every penny.", "NTA, this is such a sweet thing you did! And it's not like you just ditched the dog - you had someone organised to watch it. Why would she crack it about this? Is there something else going on with her?", "Her reaction is pretty strong, but you basically did sign up for hotel sex without asking if she'd be okay with it.\n\nMy spouse has gotten a hotel a few times too like he was doing me a romantic boon--but that was something he enjoyed, I didn't particularly care to have sex in a strange place and mostly saw it as a waste of money that I went along with because it was clearly important to *him.*\n\nAka you two have some sort of failed communication here. But I do think her reaction is overly strong so I'm going to go NTA", "If the two of you were married and struggling to make ends meet, I could understand her reaction.  But given that's not the case, her reaction is just weird.  If she didn't like the idea, she could have just told you instead of yelling at you.  Are you going to have to run any and all dates and gift ideas before her ahead of time, lest she freak out on you again?  NTA.", "it took me five minutes to read the rest of this comment bc the first line had me wheezing", "I think this post is a little dramatic lol OP is NTA but saying his relationship is over is not helping the OP and only stoking the flames.", "reality check that half the comments here and OP needs", "Like she needs to explain WHY THE FUCK IS SHE SO ANGRY ABOUT A NICE THING\n\n\nI fully expect this to end up on a BOR post because i am comPLETELY confused", "nah the man needs to break up with his girlfriend actually. what if she acts like this for every unexpected problem in the future? that would be an abusive relationship", "I genuinely thought the top comment was sarcasm at first. 'Your relationship is over' source?? Who are they to ANNOUNCE that to someone lmao people come here and comment thinking they're god or something, it's unhinged. \n\n'She's replaced you with the dog', 'she'll do it again with a baby' that's....... not info we can reasonably extract from this short post, no, and this seems oddly specific!!! There's an incredible amount of projection going on there, tbh", "I may have catastrophised somewhat", "Well sure, but if this is a 5 year relationship and not part of a pre-existing pattern, I'd guess this is a special situation. If she's regularly abusive then no question he should be hoofing it out of there.", "SAME! I just wrote a long ass reply to someone else about how much change stresses me out. I like and feel most comfortable with routines. Even things planned weeks in advance that are a significant change in my typical routine for that day can cause extreme anxiety. \n\nLike today my husband and I ran around doing a ton of things I had kept putting off- doctor's appointment, eye exam and picking new glasses, Panini booster, run to the pharmacy. I managed to do the DMV online or would have had to go there as well. All of this was planned weeks ago. But I've been stressed and anxious since I made the Doctor's appointment. And the closer I got to today, the higher my anxiety got. Not surprisingly, my doctor increased my mood stabilizer and already discussed potentially raising it again after that :p.", "!! There are so many reasons why she might be upset, many others have been mentioned by other people but I can't believe that so few comments are pointing out that he decided, on his own, that they were gonna have sex on that specific night. \n\nLike, yeah, it's upsetting to be **told** you're going to have sex when you haven't been asked about it.", "Tbh, we only know what OP is telling us. No, I wouldn't react like she did, but I actually like surprises. If this is a pattern, one where he consistently disregards her preferences and wishes, if this is something they've one over already before, yeah I can see being pissed on that basis.", "It's neither a trip nor a party. It's a hotel room for the night or even just a few hours if they want. If somebody can't trust their partner of 5 years with that, maybe they do have the emotional capacity to be in a relationship", "And for someone like me, that would stress me the fuck out. I like routine. I like things planned out well in advance. Even when things are scheduled WEEKS in advance, if it's a significant change from my typical day I stress all the weeks up to said thing. I think of all the things that are going to be have to be changed around and how much it will fuck my schedule and for how long. \n\nLike for OP's plan. Well both of our dogs would have to be boarded. That's $100, before taxes. Plus the boarder is 30 minutes away. So have to figure out drop off and pick up times. And the time to actually drive out there and back twice. Plus we have to take their own dog food with them and make sure to take all of our one dogs meds.\n\nDid my husband schedule the overnight during my period? Cause, if so, there is no way there is sex happening. Which seems to be the big point of the overnight. I am on a ton of meds and would have to bring ALL of them which is a HUGE PITA. And I would have to be extra careful to not forget one.\n\nTwo of my meds have to be injected. Did he schedule the overnight on an injection day?? Cause the injectable meds have to be refrigerated. So we couldn't do dinner and then hotel. We would have to check in to the hotel first so I could put the medication in the mini fridge. Plus I would also then have to remember to bring all the supplies for the injections inuding my huge ass sharps container.\n\nThen there is the routine stuff. I plan meals well in advance. So whatever I intended to make that night would have to be moved. So have to figure out when. Which could tricky. My husband works 3-11's. I make dinner one night and he takes the leftovers for his dinner the next night. Let's say he scheduled the overnight on his night off and I had planned on making fish/seafood. \n\nWell now we're going out to dinner. So what do I do with the fish? I'm not going to make a fish/seafood during the work week. It doesn't reheat well and everyone hates the coworker that heats up fish in the break room. So can it wait until his next day off? Will the produce for it still be good? Can't make it earlier- it takes a couple of days to thaw. And again, not making on a work night. Plus the meal I would have to switch it with may have been planned for that day because the produce for that dish may be on the verge of going bad. Either way, food is going to get thrown out and wasted.\n\nBecause my whole hair/bath routine takes a couple of hours, I have specific days when I do it. Plus washing more than that is REALLY bad for all of my dermatological problems. Did he schedule overnight on a bath day? Then it will have to either have to be skipped, so gross or moved the day before. Which would throw off the schedule. And if done the day before or after that then fucks with whatever I may have planned to get done THAT day. \n\nThat's just what I thought off the top of my head. If I thought more in depth, I'm sure I would find other stuff. So yeah, a surprise overnight would stress me out. And all the crap that would have to be arranged and jiggered around would just NOT be worth it for a single overnight.", "Plus, she is still angry about it days later.", "I still don\u2019t have the right coping strategies. Sometimes that makes me the AH, which his girlfriend was in this situation. It\u2019s one thing to be upset that he surprised her when she doesn\u2019t like them, but she continued being mad over days?? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for being upset, I think she\u2019s overreacting though and his feelings are equally important, which she doesn\u2019t seem to be thinking about at all\u2026", "It\u2019s not a question of trust in my case.  But I also don\u2019t stay angry when someone apologizes and puts things back, so to speak.  I said in another comment that I can understand the initial reaction (althoughI tend not to fly off the handle, I understand the unhappiness), but the ongoing anger says there is something else going on.", "I didn't even finish reading this honesty. It got exhausting by paragraph 5, and I say this as a very high-strung, anxious person who doesn't like surprises.  \n\nLinking [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FG-uV8qWUAAaLgr.jpg) once again. Your neuroses are not relevant to OP.", "I don\u2019t know if I agree, I\u2019ve told my partner time and again I don\u2019t like white chocolate, if he got me a white chocolate bar for my birthday, I\u2019d be pretty disappointed. I\u2019d be disappointed because that would mean he doesn\u2019t listen when I say something bothers me. That said, yelling is never okay, not ever and she should apologize for that. \n\nMy partner has never gotten me a white chocolate bar, that was just my analogy. I do hate white chocolate, though, that shit is nasty.", "A lot of people hate surprises for a lot of reasons, my reasons might not be someone else\u2019s, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less valid. I\u2019m just explaining why I hate them and as someone who does, it\u2019s relatable to me that she would be upset.", "I guess it's odd to me beacuse this dosen't even really seem like a \"surprise\". OP booked a hotel and made a dinner reservation, but then told her in advance. It's not like he waited until the night of and then took her out not telling her where she was going or something.\n\nAnd it's not like she liked the idea but wanted him to change the day or something, which it sounds like he could have done, rather she didn't want to go with OP so much she called him up and yelled at him.\n\nMy guess is honestly she's been using the puppy as an excuse beacuse she actually dosen't want to have sex but dosen't want to admit it to OP. This allows her to say \"Oh gee, I wish we had alone time for sex\" repeatedly but at the same time never actually be put in the situation to meet the expectation she is creating. OP was able to find a friend who would watch the dog instantly, and notice girlfriend isn't objecting to leaving the dog/the dog being upset. So it really seems like the dog isn't the real issue here.", "NTA\n\nshe is an asshole for that reaction, it's fine being annoyed or explaining you don't like surprises/your reasons why they think it's a bad idea/ but reaction like this for this long seems like there is a much deeper issue...", "NTA, and you\u2019ve gotten a lot of good advice about having a conversation with your gf about what is happening here. Additionally, I highly recommend you crate train your dog, for both the dog\u2019s safety and your continued sanity. Put the crate in your bedroom. That way, at night, you two can have time together without the dog jumping on you. It\u2019s also important to crate dogs when unsupervised, like when you aren\u2019t home or overnight, because they can get into things that are incredibly unsafe or deadly. My daughter\u2019s stepmom has corgis, and they don\u2019t crate them at night. One got a chip bag somehow and it got stuck on her head. She suffocated to death while everyone slept.\n\nWe have two huskies, and they cuddle in the bed with us for a little bit, then they go into their crates and sleep.

I dont get it honestly. I would be thrilled about such a cute and well planned gift.", "Exactly like you said. Girlfriend's reaction is inexplicable. So much so that my cynical mind can't help but think that we might be missing a part of the story maybe?

You tried to do a nice thing, but she didn\u2019t enjoy this surprise. \n\nDoes she like surprises? Does she like staying away? As it sounds like she\u2019s more disappointed that you don\u2019t know her or what she likes.

As a woman you\u2019re shown through tv and movies that people like being whisked away or someone turning up at their door late to give you flowers or having someone surprise them from another country etc. I say the latter because I was horrified that someone I met on holiday in a platonic way had found my address online (paid for it) and turned up at my door. He thought it would be the most romantic thing ever (so did his friends) but it was terrifying, I know you\u2019ve done nothing like this. But I just point it out because sometimes what people think are enjoyable or a fun surprise is actually the woman\u2019s nightmare/stress inducing situation. \n\nPersonally I would think it\u2019s a big waste of money to stay ten mins away, but there must be women out there who like the whole movie surprise moment of being whisked away. I think I\u2019d be upset too that I wasn\u2019t part of this planning or that my partner would think I\u2019d enjoy staying in a hotel minutes away.

She would likely feel quite guilty for leaving the dog for a whole night knowing it would be miserable without her. You might not feel the same way as the dog is not as attached to you, but she would have to go out and feel obliged to be happy and romantic when she probably would be really anxious about how your (still quite new) pup is doing. And she probably also feels guilty about not wanting to go when you made an effort and planned everything, causing her to blow up at you because both options felt shitty. It is not unlikely that she also has a lot underlying stress from dealing with the dogs separarion anxiety. And it seems she doesn't like surprises. So a soft YTA, you really should have asked her.", "Sounds like the dog is an excuse not to be intimate with you.", "Nta. I think she over reacted. I have a rescue that our daughter found 20 yrs ago (shes at least 21). She was severely abused & very distrustful of men. Most small dogs are & develop separation anxiety (sa). Its gotten to the point i have to keep her away from the other dogs (any loud noise or chaos & she attacks, shes 30lbs, they are 100+). She started w my daughter, wouldnt let anyone enter her room. Once our daughter was out on her own, ahe fixated on me. If i am in bed, no one but kids could come into the room (she acts like shes protecting food/bones but only when i am in there. Occasionally she gets protective of my granddaughter. Then recently when she got cancer, losing eye sight, health going down, its gotten more intense. Now shes 2xs as fixated. If i am not in her line of sight (only sees mostly shadows anyways) she high pitch screams. If i go check the mail, go to bathroom, take a shower, its abt 30-45 mins to calm her down. Its debilitating. For her, for me, for everyone in the house. You don't want this. I promise. Its not good for gf & not good for dog. Get help from vet or trainer immediately. It can be cute in the beginning or make someone feel loved but it isnt. Having a dog go straight into a red zone & attack someone you love, for no reason is not safe. Having a dog that cant handle it when the owner goes to the bathroom, let alone a store, is hard on the dog. Esp if circumstances change & wife needs to go back to work or you want to go on vacation or be intimate. Nothing will change until your wife is willing to work w the dog too", "NAH. My elderly dog barks if she\u2019s left alone for a second, so if both of us are going to be out of the house, we have to find a sitter. You had the right idea, but you should check with her anyway.

I wonder why your gf is so angry.", "NTA but maybe what she meant was she'd rather you make plans WITH her than to surprise her, like she likes feeling like you made the plan together she was part of it. Curious, have you done spontaneous surprises for her before, and what was her reaction?", "Is there an update? For the love of God  I would like to hear the outcome and what was actually the problem. A majority of these posts leave us hanging. By the way NTA. He did something nice and found a way to have a night of intimacy and passion with his girlfriend. Not sure why she got upset because  they both joked about the last time they have intimacy.  Sounds more like a her problem than him.", "I\u2019m confused by her reaction considering everything you mentioned. The only thing I can thinning of as a potential issue is that she doesn\u2019t like surprises and would have liked to have been consulted first and May planned it together. Also maybe she is not sure about leaving the dog by himself. Other than that, the only other explanation I have for you reaction is that she doesn\u2019t want to have sex with you but can\u2019t tell you why. Maybe she didn\u2019t know why? Maybe show her this post. Or at least open a conversation and say \u201chey my intention was xyz. Didn\u2019t mean to upset you. Can you help me understand what the problem\nIs or what I could\u2019ve done differently?\u201d", "NAH. This was a nice thought, but as someone who likes to plan ahead, news like this would make me anxious too.\n\nYou planned something big and dropped it on her out of the blue, over text. She might feel like she had no say in it at all, even though it has a heavy impact on her life and plans. She might have planned something different for that evening. Also, a dog sitter means that someone will be spending the night in your home, alone: first, that's something she should have agreed to beforehand, plus that means extra cleaning and meal prepping time.\n\nShe might also feel anxious to leave the dog with someone else. If your dog has severe separation anxiety, leaving him with a dog sitter overnight will probably make it worse.\n\nSmall, romantic surprises are fun and appreciated. A spontaneous dinner date, sure. A small gift, absolutely. But anything that requires extra effort and/or costs a considerable amount of money is best discussed beforehand.", "THIS! Thank you!!
