Backstory: My girlfriend (31) and I (33) have been dating for 5 years, living together for almost 3 now. 2 months ago we adopted a rescue dog, we love the dog and having him has been amazing so far except for one small problem: The dog developed extreme attachment to my girlfriend and won't let her out of sight even for a minute. This is not a big problem since work is flexible and we have made it work, however, our intimate time has taken a deep hit since we can never close the door of our bedroom without our doggy loudly howling and crying. We are working on this separation anxiety separately and hopefully it will get better on time. Lately we joked about how we can't remember the last time we had sex and how we will never having private time ever again. All for good laughs. Last week while browsing a website that lists discounted products and special promotions, I stumbled upon a great deal at a fancy hotel in our city, 10 minutes walking distance from our place. I immediately thought about her and booked the hotel and a table for dinner as well, thinking about it as a nice way to enjoy a casual date night and provide us with some space for us to be alone. I also made arrangements for a friend of ours to stay home with our puppy. After all the arrangements were done, I sent her a flirty message with the details of my plan, however, her answer was way different to what I expected.\n\nShe called me immediately and yelled at me. In her words, she was furious that I booked everything without asking her first and disappointed that after so long time of being together I would believe she would be happy about such a plan. Also a waste of money and a stupid thing to do given we live in the same city.\n\nIt's been now a couple of days and she's still angry at me and I feel a deep void inside, I never expected this kind of reaction and started to consider I did something outrageous.

It is *her* reaction that is inexplicable. WHY would she say she'd never be OK with it? It's not like you were going to abandon the dog, you found a sittter for the dog to keep it company.\n\n>I feel a deep void inside\n\nListen to that feeling. She rejected you. She rejected you emotionally, romantically, and sexually, in a cruel way, and she is blaming YOU for it. There is no coming back from this. Your relationship is over now, now she got this dog. Now she is prioritising this dog over you. You have been *replaced*. Plan your future accordingly.

NTA at all, you were trying to do something nice...  you payed, made all proper arrangements, and even got someone to sit the dog. Maybe she is the one who has separation anxiety from the dog.", "NTA. That's a very ungrateful response to what sounds like a well thought out surprise. This reaction over a dog? Look, I love animals as much as the next person but you can't spend your whole life catering for them. Being around your pets too much is not good for them, they never learn independence. You would be well within your rights to discuss how disappointed you are with her reaction.", "No, you're not an asshole. I do think if this relationship is going to work though that the communication pattern needs to change. Is this how it normally goes down when you have a conflict?", "I would say NTA, simply for the intended gesture. It's not clear from your post, but you probably ought to have mentioned that the dog is a big factor in your romantic getaway idea. Bummer that your partner wasn't receptive to a surprise like that. Perhaps if you had used a shared bank account to purchase the hotel stay, I'd be more understanding of your partner's response, but if it was with your own money, tbh I don't see a problem.\n\nMaybe when you bring up your disappointment with her reaction, you can reiterate how you felt like the hotel stay would be a good way to get some privacy. And why your gf assumes you would \"know by now\" that she wouldn't be into that type of thing.

It sounds like a nice gesture if the person receiving the time away actually wants it.  She might love the bonding and unconditional love she\u2019s getting from the dog. \nShe might feel you want the hotel for sex only which could make her feel cheap. \nThe intimacy level will take a dive anytime you bring in someone that can\u2019t take care of themselves but it comes back. This happens when you have kids too. \nI wouldn\u2019t say you are an AH but more uninformed of her needs. She\u2019s allowed to not want to go to a hotel room too.

In these situations, the partner (usually a woman) is portrayed as being overjoyed that their partner whisks them away. \n\nBut IRL people are complicated. They have their own crutches to get through life, and their own perceptions about other peoples intentions. Even something that one person thinks is only a nice gesture can be interpreted differently. \n\nThe way to avoid this: talking. Suggest that you could share a night in a hotel, and the suggestion itself can be fun a flirty. She might say yes, she might say no. But she\u2019s a part of the choice. The spontaneous act can impose a pressure through social cues, meaning she feels like she has to go ahead or upset you. This is especially fraught around sex. No one wants to feel \u201cpeer pressure\u201d into sex by their partner, whether intentional or not. \n\nSo I\u2019ll say NTA.

This guessing game is bullshit and she needs to be an adult and use her words.\n\nIf it later emerges that she\u2019s always hated surprises and you knew that and she\u2019s sick of repeating herself\u2026that would obviously change the verdict.", "I think the gesture in itself was nice and with best intentions, but I also understand where your gf may be coming from. \n\nI have a rescue dog as well and he also came with severe separation anxiety. Most dogs can be trained and will get over it eventually, but you can\u2019t rush that process. They need to learn that they can trust you, that you are there to stay, and that you will always return. To achieve that, you need to very slowly build up the time that you leave them. If you leave them for too long too soon, you\u2019re back to square one. \n\nI suspect that your gf is very much aware of this, and because of that she doesn\u2019t want to leave your dog \u2018alone\u2019 for an entire evening and night yet. If the anxiety is real, it\u2019s likely way too early in the process for doing that. The dog howling and crying at a closed bedroom door is a good indication for that. It has only been 2 months! \n\nMy dog was so anxious in those first months that I couldn\u2019t even go to the bathroom alone, and these days I can even go on longer trips without a problem. But it takes time to help them get over it, and usually quite a bit more time then just a couple of months.", "Something is missing here. Why did she react like this? OP is there something you are not telling us? Does she hate hotels? Hate sleeping at other places? Something you should know, but forgot/ignored?", "NTA - I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s annoyed to be honest.", "I fucking hate surprises and probably my first reaction to something like tjis could have been rage (not the yelling type, but I probanly I would have got mad).\n\nI also know that is a problem of mine and after some minutes thinking would have know what you did was nice (even if it is inconvenient with other plans I may had).\n\nThat being said, so NTA. Being irrational and making this out of proportion is on her.", "Has she never heard of a staycation? NTA", "But dog can just jump in bed and that ruins sexy times", "> The spontaneous act can impose a pressure through social cues, meaning she feels like she has to go ahead or upset you. This is especially fraught around sex.\n\nI think that's a good point, one that I had not considered in my (currently top) comment.", "Why bother? Maybe because it's so far two months out of a five year relationship that might be saved by addressing whatever the underlying issue is. Surely it's worth at least communicating and trying to figure things out like adults rather than just throwing in the towel.", "I am legit laughing at how someone with the username \"surely there's more\" came in and said, \"Nah, nothing deeper going on here, take it at face value.\" \n\nI love it", "very true. problem is, they DID talk about this.", "I understand that not everyone likes surprises,  but that doesn't apply here because, based on his years of knowing her, OP believed that she would like it. And that's why, when she didn't,  he's shocked and puzzled and hurt. And  his decision was in part based on communication, on the conversation  from a few days ago about exactly this issue\n\nAnd such *anger* as a response by her, that's not right, something else is going on here.", "I feel like this is much more nah but all the NTA are coming from people that think \"but she should be grateful he did something nice!\" Sounds like this isn't something she wants to do and if she really exploded this way, then I'm willing to bet this is an issue they've had before and op just doesn't listen. i don't know how many times I've had this exact same sequence of events with people. Sure he had good intentions and it's sweet he was thinking of doing something nice for his girlfriend...but as someone who also hates surprises and hates the whole going out to a hotel \"just because\" idea, I would be devastated if my partner sprung this on me out of no where", "Maybe she's embarassed about the friend who's dogsitting knowing it's so they can have sex? \n\nIf she's a private person with hangups about that, that would be the thing she feels OP should have known that's making her mad. \n\nMaybe she also isn't a fan of having this one night with pressure to have great sex and focus on it being a date for sex. I wouldn't be comfortable with that and would not be in the mood being ushered into this hotel by a horny man like it's prom night, and my long term partner who is familiar with my feelings and behavior around sex would definitely konw that. Some people like pomp and circumstance and some people shy away from it. Same as how some people do and don't like expensive surprises- it could be nothing more than that and if she thinks he made an obvious error maybe there has been a past issue with expensive surprises and/or him doing generic 'romantic' things and expecting them to work despite her repeatedly telling him that doesn't work for her? I know more than one woman who has been in a situation like this. \n\nOther commenters are saying how she's being annoying by playing 'the guessing game' and that could be the case, or it could be that her partner is ignoring very basic information he knows about who she is and hse's not playing a game, it's genuinely hurtful that he doesn't understand/forgot the problem and she's baffled.", ">  I think she is probably embarassed.\n\nThat is a very interesting possibility. Maybe she feels she has somehow failed as a partner and/or as a dog owner?", "I agree, the anger is what tips this way beyond \"misunderstanding\".", "That's what got me. Shit I don't have any pets that need constant supervision but I book a mini staycation just to veg out once in a while and not have to cook and clean. This would be so nice and thoughtful", "OP did say that their GF told them that after this time OP should know better. By the looks of it talking to OP doesn't have the desired effect.", "It's not a child, it's not a human you don't embarrass it.", "I mean, my parents have known me for 27 years now and still don't understand that I don't like surprises. Could still very well be that OP just isn't good at reading/ listening to his girlfriend. Girlfriend's phrasing really makes it seem like OP is just oblivious and doesn't actually know what she wants.", "IDK I'm saying NTA because she could have just explained that she doesn't want to do it without yelling & calling it stupid. Not wanting to participate doesn't make her a jerk, it's her reaction that does. \n\nIf this is the 3rd time in a year he sprang plans like this on her, I can see being frustrated - especially if she typically goes along to get along. But even then it seems like an outsized reaction to yell and insult.", "> Everyone doesn\u2019t like the same things. \n\nSure. But the point here is that OP *thought* she would like it, based on his years of knowing her.  And that's why he's shocked and puzzled and hurt.", "It hinges on that, doesn't it? Either OP has somehow failed in 5 years to pick up on what she does and does not like, or she's playing games.", "Oh your parents understand, they just don't care, because they enjoy springing them.\n\nBut yes, you make a good point. That could be why she exploded: last straw and all that.", "> This wouldn't be a thoughtful gift for me.\n\nAnd that is relevant here because why exactly?"]}
