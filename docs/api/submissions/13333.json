My brother and I are not splitting our inheritance with our aunts", "selftext": "So a little history to this story, my grandad owned a farm and when he passed the land was split accordingly between my dad and my 3 aunts and let's just say my dad received 50 acres (we use different units for land where I am from). My dad passed suddenly without a will and where I am from, due to my dad's passing in intestate, the first in line to receive the inheritance are the descendants the next tier down would be my grandparents, then next tier then would be my aunts (I hope this makes sense).\n\nSo now to the story:\n\nEarlier this week my older brother received a letter from a lawyer stating that it is proposed by my grandmother that she will receive 30 out of the 50 acres if me and my brother do not reject the proposal. Shocked by this, my brother called our grandmother and aunts (they live together) and asked them why they didn't speak to us first before making that proposal, their excuses were \"Oh you're always busy\", \"You never ring us anymore\", etc. After discussing the matter with them, their reasoning for taking 3/5 of the inheritance is the debt that my brother and I owe them for raising us and putting us through approx. 5-7 years of school before we moved abroad with my mom and step-dad. Realistically they only raised one of us as my mom and step-dad sent them money monthly to cover the costs for one of us. Anyways my aunts' plan is to have my grandmother put on her will to split the 30 acres amongst the 3 of them when she passes. To sugar coat the issue, they were saying \"We are still leaving 20 acres for both of you\". If you are wondering why my mom wasn't present to raise me and my brother, she decided to leave the family because when my dad passed away in his sleep, my 3 aunts blamed my mother for his death and that she killed him, she couldn't deal with it.\n\nMy 3 aunts have already sold their land and my brother and I believe that they have spent most of their money and are running low as they live quite a lavish lifestyle and that is why they are coming after our inheritance.\n\nWe are planning to reject the proposal, are we the assholes?.", "created_utc": 1679935500, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123sqih/wibta_my_brother_and_i_are_not_splitting_our/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The estate passes to the next tier (class II heirs) in the absence of any living class I heirs. The whole thing belongs to you and your brother.

I'm not too familiar with it either tbh, only that my brother received that letter and we can either accept or reject because we are \"first in line\" (I don't know how else to phrase it) , I think the reason they were able to propose that offer was because my grandmother who was the next tier down made the proposal and just need our \"approval\" basically.
