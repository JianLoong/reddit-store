{"id": 24335, "submission_id": "15nduin", "title": "AITA for telling my son I \"don't care\" what he has to say?", "selftext": "So, a little background. I (39M) have been married to my wife (38F) for 10 years next month. We've been together for 13 years, and we have 4 kids; the oldest 3 are not biologically mine, and are from her previous marriage: for the sake of brevity, the only one involved in this is my oldest son, who we'll call \"Kevin.\" (17M).\n\nTheir bio-dad is not in the picture, and has not been since almost the day my wife and I started seeing each other. He was abusive in every sense of the word, a narcissistic POS, a drug addict, and several other choice descriptors. He ran out with his pregnant girlfriend ages ago, and we've not seen him since. There's been an occasional FB message or phone call, but nothing in the last year, which is a whole separate story in itself.\n\nNow, for the issue: my son has been.... not himself lately. Even going through puberty, he still largely remained a kind, compassionate, decent young man, who constantly thought of others before himself. We had an issue a couple of years ago, where he had an anger issue, but we were able to work past it.\n\nHowever, now he's got a girlfriend (17F) who we'll call \"Brittany.\" Brittany has a not-great home life, with a mother who apparently barely acknowledges her existence. Brittany also dropped out of school more than a year ago, and does nothing but stay at that house (when she's not over at ours, which is constantly).  Kevin and Brittany may as well be attached at the hip. They are never NOT physically in touch with each other when she's around, and when she's not, Kevin is buried in his phone talking to her. My fear is that it's becoming increasingly co-dependent.\n\nKevin has increasingly been hostile and abusive to his siblings and me, but not to his mom.\n\nWe've tried to address this multiple times, in multiple ways, and every time, he stares into space, like nothing is reaching him, he mouths some platitudes about doing better, and then right back to the same behavior. His words and actions are not matching up.\n\nThings finally came to a head about 2 weeks ago; my wife and I had him come out to the front porch, we tried to point out his behavior, and he kept throwing out excuses, how things are his siblings' fault, or some other person's fault, but never his own.\n\nI told him flat out that I don't care what he has to say, because his actions have more than shown his intentions.\n\nThis set him off, and he yelled that I \"never believe him\" and that I \"don't fucking care\" about him, at which point, I walked back inside without saying a word.\n\nHe's barely said 5 words to me in the last 2 weeks, and my wife thinks I should have handled it differently. I don't know how to approach it without making things worse, as he's not going to listening to me.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1691677200, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nduin/aita_for_telling_my_son_i_dont_care_what_he_has/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But that frustration builds up, and eventually it overflows.", "NTA - You and your wife absolutely must be on the same page and address it together.

Or get him a therapist.", "You are not the asshole, I don\u2019t think Kevin is either, he\u2019s just a frustrated teen. I have two suggestions. \n\n1. I think you and your wife should make a strong effort to connect with your sons girlfriend, you know she has a rough home life and it sounds like something you and your wife have experience with/can relate to, help her out, offer insight or guidance, create the safe space for her that like you said you longed for as a kid.\n\n2. Your sons relationship may be and probably is co-dependent, he is 17, it is presumably his first real relationship, as a parent you have to let your kid learn those tough dating lessons on their own, as long as the relationship isn\u2019t abusive, you shouldn\u2019t butt in.", "NTA - someone suggested taking him fishing, and that\u2019s a great idea!
