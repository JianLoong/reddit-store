Super loving and is always happy to see me. But she has issues that my fianc\u00e9 of 6 years has never been able to get over. Such as resource guarding and anxiety. My dog whines more often than not. Like if I leave the room, she whines. If I walk out to leave she will bolt out at the door going 110mph and whine at the car door because she doesn't want me to leave without her. She never bonded with my fianc\u00e9. She absolutely tried but my dog never gave a rats ass, to be blunt. She's a one person dog and I'm her person. \n\nNow the issue is that my fianc\u00e9 recently found out that's she pregnant. We were told this was impossible and had planned our life out not involving children because we were seriously told by numerous doctors that she could not conceive. She's absolutely terrified. I'm completely indifferent because I was on the fence about kids anyways and then I was told she couldn't have any so I was expecting a kid free life and was fine with it. I mean, we are fucking 30 already. Regardless, there is a piece of me that is stupid excited so I'm sure my mind will eventually be full on excited versus kind of put off. \n\nThe issue is that my wife doesn't want my dog around the baby because of the dogs resource guarding. There are some days where my fianc\u00e9 can't even get close to me without my dog losing her absolute shit. And she does nip (herding mix). Not hard but still nips. Yes, she's been in and out of training. She's also on meds for anxiety. Nothing has helped and if anything she has regressed. So she doesn't want the dog around our baby. A part of me understands but a much, much bigger part of me is completely unwilling to let go of my dog, whom my fianc\u00e9 doesn't like anyways. It almost feels like she thinks this is her excuse to get rid of my dog. So anyways, we got in to a heated argument about it and I finally snapped and said \"I would never fucking choose you over my dog\" and I left. Stayed at a hotel for a few days. We didn't speak. I came back today, with my dog, and she won't even look at me. The second me or the dog walk anywhere near her she makes a point to walk in the opposite direction. My friends are on my side but I want unbiased feedback.\n\nEdit: errors.", "created_utc": 1678912704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s8i9k/aita_for_telling_her_id_never_choose_her_over_my/", "score": 760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s going to \u2018nip\u2019, and when the child continues to go around her food or try to play with you, she is going to bite the child. And when you\u2019re in the hospital getting your baby stitches, the doctors won\u2019t give a shit that, \u201coh, well she didn\u2019t kill the baby so\u201d. That will end one of two ways.

She is a perfect Corgi mix. Super loving and is always happy to see me. But she has issues that my fianc\u00e9 of 5 years has never been able to get over. Such as resource guarding and anxiety. My dog whines more often than not. Like if I leave the room, she whines. If I walk out to leave she will bolt out at the door going 110mph and whine at the car door because she doesn't want me to leave without her. She never bonded with my wife. My wife absolutely tried but my dog never gave a rats ass, to be blunt. She's a one person dog and I'm her person. \n\nNow the issue is that my fianc\u00e9 recently found out that's she pregnant. We were told this was impossible and had planned our life out not involving children because we were seriously told by numerous doctors that she could not conceive. She's absolutely terrified. I'm completely indifferent because I was on the fence about kids anyways and then I was told she couldn't have any so I was expecting a kid free life and was fine with it. I mean, we are fucking 30 already. Regardless, there is a piece of me that is stupid excited so I'm sure my mind will eventually be full on excited versus kind of put off. \n\nThe issue is that my wife doesn't want my dog around the baby because of the dogs resource guarding. There are some days where my fianc\u00e9 can't even get close to me without my dog losing her absolute shit. And she does nip (herding mix). Not hard but still nips. Yes, she's been in and out of training. She's also on meds for anxiety. Nothing has helped and if anything she has regressed. So she doesn't want the dog around our baby. A part of me understands but a much, much bigger part of me is completely unwilling to let go of my dog, whom my fianc\u00e9 doesn't like anyways. It almost feels like she thinks this is her excuse to get rid of my dog. So anyways, we got in to a heated argument about it and I finally snapped and said \"I would never fucking choose you over my dog\" and I left. Stayed at a hotel for a few days. We didn't speak. I came back today, with my dog, and she won't even look at me. The second me or the dog walk anywhere near her she makes a point to walk in the opposite direction. My friends are on my side but I want unbiased feedback.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So blaming her for the situation is really not fair. She has absolutely valid concerns. Be a dad and be responsible for the safety of your child (without the dog around).\nCould you have some insecurities around becoming a father that you project on your fianc\u00e9?", "YTA You\u2019re going to be a father.

My gosh, son... this is so easy.  I get it...you have a dog and you're fond of it.  Meanwhile, your fianc\u00e9 is gifted with a miracle baby and now every instinct in her body is telling her to protect that baby with all her being.  So in response to this miracle... you tell her you're choosing the dog!?!  \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is correct to want to keep that dog away from the baby because some dogs really do attack and kill small children.  If the dog wasn't as neurotic as you explained, that might change things, but even on this side of the keyboard I can picture that dog nipping your newborn.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and rehome that dog and embrace being a father.", "YTA. But why don\u2019t you try negotiating with your fianc\u00e9 about it. Offer to bring the dog to a long term obedience school to see if they can break it if it\u2019s bad habits. Agree that if the dog has not significantly changed for the better that you will comply with her demands. If the dog does show acceptable behavior maybe it stays. Also offer to set firm boundaries on where the dog is allowed. Perhaps invest in a dog run and outdoor kennel where the dog will be very limited or off limits within your home, at least for the first years.

As for saying the dog will not kill the kid, your dog is already displaying signs of jealousy. You might think, it's okay, you will watch them in case anything happens but this will be impossible to do when the kid starts running around, grabbing, pulling and hugging.

I want to make this completely clear: you did not tell your partner you would choose the dog over her: you told your partner you would choose your dog over your *child.* Choosing a dog over a partner is one thing.

You'd still be TA, but at least it would be somewhat more understandable. \n\nBut you've had this dog a third of the time you've been with her, and you essentially just told her you love this dog more than both her and your unborn miracle baby.

She\u2019s been in and out of training? No wonder she\u2019s regressing, there needs to be consistency behind training for it to work.

You\u2019re a two person household. Your dog is a one-person dog, so why are you forcing her into a two-person household?

Your dog is resource guarding you and you have instead of investing in proper training allowed it to continue, thus enforcing this behavior and cementing your dog as the next up in the hierarchy of the house after you. You cannot control your dog in an environment of adult that know how to approach a dog and understand that the dog has resource guarding issues, what makes you think you will have any control once a child is added to the situation. Lastly It could have just not been included but I don't see a singular mention of you finding a qualified trainer, or making any attempt to correct this behavior, if true this makes you an incredibly irresponsible pet owner.\n\nEdit; yes I saw the dog was in and out of training, however in my experience this generally just means they did a few classes, got told things they needed to work on at home, didn't work on those things and then said we'll training doesn't work.\n\nEdit edit; I'm also curious about the level of activity the dog is getting as a herding breed is a working dog and needs a high level of physical AND mental exercise.\n\nEdit edit edit; why don't you just come out and say you're scared of having the kid and work through the issue instead of pretending youre upset about the dog?", ">Yes, she's been in and out of training. She's also on meds for anxiety. Nothing has helped and if anything she has regressed\n\nMy god dude, I can already tell just by your post that you're the reason this dog has these issues.

As someone who works in the vet industry, I hate these types of owners", "Yes, especially when I saw how new the dog was, all the \u201cmy dog\u201d talk when the relationship predates the dog, and the \u201cshe really tried to bond with the dog\u201d\u2026 it just all gives me the feeling OP has intentionally or not fostered this, or at the very least isn\u2019t doing enough to shut it down.", "Nobody\u2019s telling her to abort. She *could* consider the child a miracle baby, or she *could* be absolutely terrified and unprepared as she thought she would never be in this position. We don\u2019t know the specifics of her feelings or situation and it\u2019s not up to us to eliminate options from her because *we* think she should consider things one way or another.", "Of course. I'm willing to present all options.", "well, in OP's own words, she was terrified of that new reality alone even before the dog issues came up.\n\nOP made it clear she is below the dog in worth, so its been established the wedding is now off permanently. If she keeps the kid she will be a single mother with hopefully, a very strong hopefully, some child support since the dog is going to attack and bite the child every time the child comes over and the father apparently can't leave the dog behind to visit often because of dog's anxiety problems, not that he would anyways because if he doesn't put his own fiance above the dog he's not going to put a kid he has limited custody rights too above the dog.\n\nSo she's now in a scary and unplanned situation of having a baby, and suddenly is going to be without the partner of 6 years that she planned on being with, and likely won't have the house either. Miracle baby that was wanted or not, in that situation i wouldn't bring a kid into this world and into that emotional mess in those circumstances.", "Well it seems she\u2019s terrified and from OP\u2019s words it seems like he\u2019s the one who really wants the baby. I wouldn\u2019t want to be a single parent, lots of people don\u2019t, regardless of it would be a miracle baby. Infertility is a sensitive topic, sure, but nobody is saying she *has* to. Just that it\u2019s an option, and the commenter hopes she chooses whatever option will keep the possible miracle away from OP.", "Yup. It's an option on the table worth being discussed. There's no mention of her thinking of it that way.", "We don't know that she's considering the child her miracle baby. And most people can't afford to be single parents these days -- it's not just a matter of money, it's a matter of being able to afford the time and day to day labor, too. What if she doesn't have a support system? OP, who clearly is ambivalent about the pregnancy, cannot be relied upon to help. It's evil to bring a child into the world if you can't provide for its basic needs, financially or emotionally or otherwise.\n\nAnd OP didn't go into detail, but many of the health issues that make conception difficult also make pregnancy difficult or dangerous -- so we should hope she's considering abortion, along with adoption and going it alone. Whatever she decides, it's clear she'll be better off without OP.", "This! My friend had a Papillion cross that was really sweet and great with kids until my friend had her own kid  and the dog wasn't my friend's no.1 anymore. In the end, the kindest thing for him was to rehome him to a lovely childless couple who would spoil him. The dog had no idea why he was no longer as important and my friend had no way of knowing that that was how he would react after baby was born. OP already knows that his dog won't accept being second place.", "I'm probably awful but I instinctively said \"oh fucking of course\" to an empty room when I got there.", "I took that to mean they\u2019ve been together 6 years and she\u2019s currently his fianc\u00e9, but now you got me wondering", "This guy gets it.", "Yep.

The rest is just the icing on the cake.", "It would be slightly relevant only insofar as his being able to say, \"you knew what you were signing up for when we started dating.\" \n\nWouldn't really move the needle here but it would give at least a small amount of benefit of the doubt in regards to why he would be acting irrationally.", "I think it\u2019s relevant, because at least if he\u2019d had the dog before they met, she would have realized he wasn\u2019t giving up the dog and made her choice based on that. Instead, she spent four years with him before he brought home a dog that hates her and and then chose it over her.", "*their unborn child. Literally is his too and he gives no fucks. What the hell", "I can guarantee you that this was never something that was taken seriously. Resource guarding is absolutely some thing that can be corrected, and easily if you start early. Now it\u2019s going to be quite the feat. OP likely encouraged this behavior, or just found a cute that his dog was so \u201cprotective\u201d of him.", "Well, he is indifferent to the baby, so the choice will be easy for him. \"Come doggy, bye baby\"", "Even if she didn\u2019t predate the dog pregnant women > dog.\n\nBaby > dog", ">Even trained dogs are unsafe with newborn.\n\nCompletely untrue.", "Oh yes, my planned child at 32 (husband 36) was basically the christ child because I managed to conceive in such a barren, geriatric womb. /s", "I mean I think OP just does not want kids while his fiance does, and he's expressing that frustration through this silly topic of his dog (which objectively any sane person would prioritise their baby over their dog, with zero exceptions).\n\nI think I would also be in a difficult place mentally if I had deliberately set my life up with someone who I believed was infertile, knowing I would never have to have children. Not saying this guy isnt an AH but I have sympathy.", "My his behavior I was hoping 5.\n\u2018Ah look the dog loooooves me more and is going to bite your ass!\u2019 \nI hope she takes him to the cleaner if she keeps the child.", "I LOL\u2019d at that.

Oh my god\n\nIf I was her I would question all of my life choices, I feel so sorry for her", "I'm even more stunned and very confused as to why she said yes. Or has been with him for 6 years. Either this post is bait, or fiancee has more issues than OP has.", "Yes, they don't actually train the dog per se, they train YOU to train the dog and it takes a concerted effort.", "Id even suggest seeing a behaviourist, as a person with a dog that resource guards (rescue), they never saw improvement until we meet with an actual behaviourist instead of a dog trainer. They\u2019re expensive, but the dog is 2 and can change if my dog who\u2019s 8 saw improvement. Theyll also recommend rehoming if its a danger (to children) or euthanasia if its a danger in general.", "It\u2019s been my experience that couples who don\u2019t actually get married, or start planning for it at least, soon after the engagement, never do. Just an observation over 30+ years of people watching. Not to say getting married quickly makes for a longer/better marriage, it\u2019s maybe a momentum thing?

They don't hold you accountable for your actions or have the capacity to love/hate the way a person does. I adore my cat and birds, but they aren't people.

OP letting her get away with that kind of behavior will cause future problems for sure.", "Agreed, the dog already figured out it was higher up than the fiance which is partially why it continues the bad behavior towards her aside from the lack of consistent training.  OP is the problem here even more so than the dog.", "Not true.  Dogs can absolutely look at people as resources.  Lack of understanding of that fact is why many people describe their dogs as \"protective\" when they're actually possessive.  Pretty much the same end result as far as behavior, but the motivations are completely different and may require different types of training to address.", "Yep! Dogs pay a lot of attention to hierarchy and with his actions, he's clearly told this dog, time and time again, that she's more important than his fiance. The \"in and out of training\" is also telling - if your dog has 'nipped' people multiple times, it's absolutely your job to keep her in training until she stops doing that. I've never met a dog that can't be trained out of biting people as long as you're clear and consistent about them biting every single time they do it. \n\nI'm leaning towards thinking potentially OP doesn't actually want a child and if he doesn't give up his untrained dog, and refuses to put the work in to train her, well, he can't really be a father then can he? They'll have to break up and he won't get custody because his house will be unsafe for a baby, oh well, it's not his fault because he loves his dog. \n\nI wonder what he told his friends to make them on his side on keeping a completely untrained dog that is definitely going to harm an infant if she's allowed around the child.", "Yeah totally agree with the dog showing hierarchy. Dogs control people way more than you think especially small dogs.
