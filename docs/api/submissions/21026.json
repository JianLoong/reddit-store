Based on other replies I understand she is struggling with mental health issues, and I think you\u2019re putting in effort and I applaud you scheduling a family therapy session. It feels manipulative that she would accuse you of emotionally abusing her. She is almost a grown woman and obviously knows how to bathe and take care of her hygiene. You shouldn\u2019t have to live in stench. It\u2019s a difficult situation but I think you\u2019re handling it the best you can.", "NAH. It\u2019s good to teach your kid to have good hygiene, but it\u2019s also normal for teenagers to be easily embarrassed about you saying that type of thing. The limbic system or emotional brain matures before the frontal lobes, so teens struggle with emotional regulation as you probably know.", "NTA but do you know why she lets it get to that extent? Is it just laziness or do you think there could be a bigger issue she\u2019s going through?", "NTA, but maybe let her know that you're concerned about the smell beyond any shameful reason.  She could need to see a doctor about the smell.  If the doctor says it's a hygiene issue, then you're validated.  If the doctor finds a health issue, then at least the problem can be solved.", "Ok... let's bracket this.   \nShe is insecure about herself. As a result you must market your advice along these lines.    \nYou want the best for her... and her peers must think the same. Who should provide the guidance.", "EDIT: LOL forgot to say NTA, but maybe you need to start listening better.\n\nI read a bunch of the comments; I see she is being treated for anxiety with therapy and medication, going into a program, etc.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Does your daughter have issues with sensory stimulation? Loud noises, different clothing textures, gets distracted when the TV is on, gets headaches from bright lights, etc? Could be all of these, could be none, these are just examples. The reason I ask is this: A younger sibling of mine had an aversion to certain showers. Like, if we went to a hotel, sibling would scream and cry and say the water hurt. Or sometimes it was a friend's house. We thought it was the temperature of the water at first but nope, that wasn't the problem. None of us could figure out what my sibling meant by the water \"hurting,\" and sibling couldn't really find the words to explain. We thought they were being overdramatic for years. They stopped complaining as they got older and just bore it silently, so we thought they grew out of it. Nope.\n\nWhen they were a teen, we figured out it was actually the water pressure. For most people if the pressure is a little high, it's usually not a big deal, it's just a stronger water stream. To my sibling, however, the extra stimulation was so physically jarring it was actually painful. They now describe it like getting hit on the funny bone, but all over. My sibling has diagnosed anxiety and ADHD, and we're finding out now they may also be autistic. Sibling is now in their mid 20s.\n\nBased on your descriptions of your daughter's behavior and responses to you, I'm definitely seeing signs of severe depression but I'm also wondering if there is a specific aversion to showering that may stem from another source, as with my sibling. Well, perhaps it's not exactly like my sibling, but still maybe something to ask her about. You keep asking \"why\" she wouldn't want to shower -- the issue might be more complicated than you think, and she might now know how to explain it or doesn't think you'll understand or listen. My family really regrets not listening better to my sibling when they were younger and thinking the worst of them when what they really needed was someone to listen and help problem solve. Not just with the shower thing either.\n\nGood luck. Keep an open mind, listen to your daughter, and take a deep breath when you need it. Outside. Away from the stinky armpits. ;)", "She wouldnt have a complex if she fixed the stinky, NTA\n\nIm a stinky person and I kinda forget about it but I am very open to someone saying I need some deoderant, I aopligize to them  thank them and then take care of it. I feel bad that people end up in the situation where they need to tell me, but we all breath better in the end.", "Absolutely not", "pre-read: NTA? depends how you said it and if you were trying to let them know rather than attack them  \n\n\npost-read: NTA still but it sounds like your daughter needs some encouragement in life or a therapist or you to give her DIRECTION/GUIDANCE, since you're PARENTS. teaching her to KEEP HERSELF CLEAN. YTA for being upset with what you've created.", "YTA Have you talked to her about what\u2019s going on? She sounds incredibly depressed.  Probably best to solve her BO problem by figuring out the cause.", "YTA - the body odour isn\u2019t the problem if she\u2019s dealing with mental health needs. It\u2019s a symptom of that. Stop focusing on how you think she smells and support her in how she feels. If she\u2019s been calling you and your husband emotionally abusive, then there\u2019s more to this story. There\u2019s something greater she\u2019s been experiencing that\u2019s led to her lack of personal hygiene and daily routine, and you haven\u2019t paid attention to it.", "NAH but I mean anything organic that remain in a closed air environment will smell. Does her room have a window? A little fresh air should help. \n\nFor body odor that can be because of a lot of health related things and humans naturally do smell. If the odor is bad I cannot imagine that to be healthy and perhaps should check with doctor just to be cautious. As for emotional abuse I don't know what your intent was or if you guys went overboard", "Nta, as harsh as it is, you are just stating facts and condition", "NTA\n\nAsk your daughter if she'd rather hear it from you/your husband or other people outside the immediate family.  Look, if she stinks, other notice and will tend to leave her behind.", "NTA.

Girls have enough negative energy thrown at them from the rest of the world. Try to go the supportive route and encourage her to take care of herself with good hygiene. My 15 year old son is just the same, but I\u2019m tough and blunt with him because he\u2019s a boy. Carrot or the stick? Try to make her want to make the choice instead of telling her what to do. Just a thought anyway", "No", "NTA - it\u2019s something she needs to be able to pick up on herself, and have it very kindly picked up as you seem to be doing, if she\u2019s not quite noticing it on her own. It\u2019s so socially unacceptable and she\u2019ll have problems down the line, so it\u2019s probably kindest to her her parents say something now. \n\nIt\u2019s also quite unfair on the rest of the household if the smell starts to affect everyone else. \n\nPerhaps it might be worth talking to her about what can be done to make the bathing experience easier? Having heated towels for getting out, different products, maybe having a heater in the bathroom so it\u2019s warm when she gets out, maybe she\u2019d prefer the room darker & lit with fairy lights etc etc", "YTA she\u2019s almost 18, she knows.

I forgave her eventually but, boy, did I make a lot of bad decisions for myself in the meanwhile.\n\nYou made a very wise decision to have a family counseling session. It will be a good opportunity to listen and learn more of your daughter\u2019s perspective. With the help of the therapist, she\u2019ll be able to articulate what support from you looks like to her. And your help will actually become effective. \n\nFor me, the best thing my mom could have done was to acknowledge and accept my feelings. Never to force me to do anything but to believe in me; that I\u2019m the expert of my life and I will eventually know what to do and when to do it. This, of course, must be combined with professional help.

Either way the state vocational program will be there to help.", "Ok so I'm not the only one?\n\nShe reminds me of one of those moms whose whole world crumbled the day one of the members didn't fit the mold. \n\nShe makes herself out to be the concerned mom who just wants what's best. Its more along the lines of what will anyone outside this house think of me as a mother when they see her daughter\n\nEdit: Listen.. I am not saying they are bad parents but she is has to stop this expectation of what normal has to looks like. Her daughter is special needs whether she likes it or not. Her daugter needs more than just a person who does all the leg work and then says \"off ya go\". A gentle hand and understanding. Mental health sometimes is getting the big things done and the little things fall by the wasteside.", "Listen I am not being a bitch...\n\nWell maybe a little and I'm sorry.\n\nBut my parents come from a generation of don't air your dirty laundry...\n\nI have been depressed all my life but \"how can you be depressed? You have all you need... you have no responsibility... wait until you are an adult\"\n\nWell I am an adult and have BiPolar Depression Disorder and struggle to get out of bed somedays. Showers are not important to me.. being in the same clothes..\nEtc\n\nSo when I read all of this, I was pissed off.\n\nI'm really hoping that you and your family can be helped to communicate a little more productive and be able to understand eachother better", "Thank you.", "The plan or action would be to handle her own grooming regularly.  When she was a child she was taught how to bathe regularly.  She is provided hygiene products including antiperspirant.  She knows how to use it.  She is medicated for her anxiety and sees a therapist.  She claims not to smell her own BO, but when it is overwhelming it is disruptive to the other people in the household, so we mention it.  When we do, she uses the skills and products provided to her to make the smell go away.", "I could use the laugh.  Thanks \ud83d\ude4f", "This is what I think too, how could she not know?  I think right now she\u2019s showering about once or twice a week.  I don\u2019t keep track, but that\u2019s about how often I hear the water going.", "Rewarding good positive behaviors and celebrating the small victories.", "\"Being a parent of an intelligent special needs child is like walking through a minefield.\"\n\nNo, it's not easy. \n\nBut there is more to this than just this issue.\n\nSeriously, there is something underneath the surface there..\n\nNo I don't know you...\nNo I don't have a special needs child\nBut I read enough of these to know when details are being left out", "I think you are right to remind her of hygiene and it\u2019s good that you are addressing this situation in counseling too. That said, she really may not smell it. I  can\u2019t smell my daily perfume anymore. Maybe a whiff when it first hits but I have to be careful to only spray once because I\u2019ll suffocate others if I spray enough to smell it myself.  It\u2019s why people say to pay attention to what your house smells like when you come back from a trip - that moment\u2019s smell is what visitors likely smell when they come over. Best time to notice issues.\n\nAs a teen? Yeah my mom had to give me a heads up when I was oblivious to it. What\u2019s kind of strange though is her lack of change. I was so embarrassed that I took measures to avoid a repeat. That she doesn\u2019t do that makes me think it\u2019s something more than just teen laziness.", "So crazily enough, I just learned tonight that you\u2019re supposed to put antiperspirant on at bed time for best results even if you shower the next morning. I had no clue and I have issues with a lot of sweating and BO. I use clinical strength deodorant because regular doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s probably HOW you\u2019ve been saying it. Maybe you\u2019re being too blunt. People expect that just because you\u2019re a parent that that somehow also makes you an expert on handling mental health issues and other disabilities. If you\u2019re truly helping her get all these resources to help ensure her independence, then you\u2019re doing the best you can. She needs to continue therapy, maybe find a better one. Her self care will directly impact and shape how she will care for other areas of her life. But you should research some parenting articles on how to approach your children in a kinder manner when it comes to difficult topics like this. \n\nNTA is my vote, just a concerned parent that is trying to learn.", "This is not uncommon at all. Suppose one works in the sewers. First day on the job smell is overwhelming and unbearable. After 10 years probably don't smell a thing. That's how the brain works to compensate, otherwise people would go crazy working in those conditions.\n\nThere are plenty of people with body odor that knows nothing about it until someone tell them.", "Googled it:\n\nhttps://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/news/a44050/how-to-check-for-body-odor/", "This comment make me tear up.  Thank you for your kind words.  Your perspective is helpful to hear.", "She does have an air freshener, we have gone through her clothes. She does have a standing laundry hamper.  She has a custom closet with plenty of hangers and a dresser.  She has a shoe organizer.  Thanks for the well wishes.", "Y\u2019all sound like great parents. It seems like you\u2019re doing everything you can. Ultimately, it\u2019s not your fault if she doesn\u2019t choose a healthier lifestyle. I hope she does, though. I\u2019ve got a lot of mental health issues that sound similar to hers, and I\u2019ve finally figured out after however many years that taking care of my body helps my mental health too, even though my illness tries to tell me it\u2019s pointless. I feel for your daughter and you. Good luck.", "That\u2019s a great first step! And I think in terms of you, having a therapist to support you and how to talk to your daughter about what\u2019s going on with her.", "Thanks for that.  I appreciate your viewpoint.  To ease your mind, I\u2019m not abandoning my daughter to a state run independent living facility.  It\u2019s 8 apartments in an apartment complex with people from all walks of life also living there, including an onsite adult helper if support help is needed day or night.  For one year she\u2019ll be taught as a legally blind person how to cook, clean, grocery shop, etc.  It\u2019s to help with her confidence, not cut her off.  I believe some of her depression is due to feeling overwhelmed with impending adulthood and that she can\u2019t make it without her eyes (her friends from school are normally sighted).  I\u2019m hoping this program will give her confidence and help her meet other young people like herself.  Hopefully she\u2019ll make some good friendships in the process.", "I responded in the other comment with a link.. it is known that most people are insensitive to their own smell.\n\nI know because there is a famous Chinese saying for exactly this.", "Out of 7 days a week at her age she needs to shower at least 3. Everyone sweats a certain amount at night. And for woman our regional area needs cleaning more often then one day a week.", "OP means well here either way, so honestly what does it matter? OP has only stated that the smell is there. Not shamed in any way. If OP included more details about what was said, we could know for sure. But going off the post and comments, OP meant well.", "You could be right.  I\u2019ve tried to be matter of fact about it to keep it from being an attack, and more of a statement.  Like if some one stepped in dog doo I\u2019d say, oops need to clean that up because it smells, not as a commentary about their value as a human being. She\u2019s obviously more sensitive about it even though I don\u2019t view it as a personal shortfall, just a fact of life.  I\u2019ll take your advice and look for ways to approach in a kinder way.", "Interesting.  To be fair, I\u2019ve accepted her answer that she doesn\u2019t smell it.  I never challenged the claim with her.  I just matter of factly say the smell is there and will she please resolve it.", "Living with PTSD, and having problems keeping up, something I do to make myself feel better is setting up a relaxing space I genuinely enjoy. I almost make it a spiritual practice.\n\nMaybe offer a little shopping spree to spruce up her space? \nNew sheets, salt lamps, incorporate incense. I find that making little packets of coffee grounds and tucking them in corners helps lift smells. In routine, opening all the windows and febreze", "Thank you.", "This is helpful advice.  I\u2019ve thought about it before, but haven\u2019t followed through.  I\u2019ve probably been too stoic and having a professional to talk to would be helpful.", "Yeah, either way she truly doesn't know and its very normal and not because she is weird or anything. So now I think you need to get the message across some other way. Perhaps have her set a notification so she knows when to go about doing these things so you don't need to tell her. Even a normal person would be embarrassed about body odor so I think I can identify the issue here.", "I really like this idea.  Thank you."]}
