Based on other replies I understand she is struggling with mental health issues, and I think you\u2019re putting in effort and I applaud you scheduling a family therapy session. It feels manipulative that she would accuse you of emotionally abusing her. She is almost a grown woman and obviously knows how to bathe and take care of her hygiene. You shouldn\u2019t have to live in stench. It\u2019s a difficult situation but I think you\u2019re handling it the best you can.", "NAH. It\u2019s good to teach your kid to have good hygiene, but it\u2019s also normal for teenagers to be easily embarrassed about you saying that type of thing. The limbic system or emotional brain matures before the frontal lobes, so teens struggle with emotional regulation as you probably know.", "NTA but do you know why she lets it get to that extent? Is it just laziness or do you think there could be a bigger issue she\u2019s going through?", "NTA, but maybe let her know that you're concerned about the smell beyond any shameful reason.  She could need to see a doctor about the smell.  If the doctor says it's a hygiene issue, then you're validated.  If the doctor finds a health issue, then at least the problem can be solved.", "Ok... let's bracket this.   \nShe is insecure about herself. As a result you must market your advice along these lines.    \nYou want the best for her... and her peers must think the same. Who should provide the guidance.", "EDIT: LOL forgot to say NTA, but maybe you need to start listening better.\n\nI read a bunch of the comments; I see she is being treated for anxiety with therapy and medication, going into a program, etc.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Does your daughter have issues with sensory stimulation? Loud noises, different clothing textures, gets distracted when the TV is on, gets headaches from bright lights, etc? Could be all of these, could be none, these are just examples. The reason I ask is this: A younger sibling of mine had an aversion to certain showers. Like, if we went to a hotel, sibling would scream and cry and say the water hurt. Or sometimes it was a friend's house. We thought it was the temperature of the water at first but nope, that wasn't the problem. None of us could figure out what my sibling meant by the water \"hurting,\" and sibling couldn't really find the words to explain. We thought they were being overdramatic for years. They stopped complaining as they got older and just bore it silently, so we thought they grew out of it. Nope.\n\nWhen they were a teen, we figured out it was actually the water pressure. For most people if the pressure is a little high, it's usually not a big deal, it's just a stronger water stream. To my sibling, however, the extra stimulation was so physically jarring it was actually painful. They now describe it like getting hit on the funny bone, but all over. My sibling has diagnosed anxiety and ADHD, and we're finding out now they may also be autistic. Sibling is now in their mid 20s.\n\nBased on your descriptions of your daughter's behavior and responses to you, I'm definitely seeing signs of severe depression but I'm also wondering if there is a specific aversion to showering that may stem from another source, as with my sibling. Well, perhaps it's not exactly like my sibling, but still maybe something to ask her about. You keep asking \"why\" she wouldn't want to shower -- the issue might be more complicated than you think, and she might now know how to explain it or doesn't think you'll understand or listen. My family really regrets not listening better to my sibling when they were younger and thinking the worst of them when what they really needed was someone to listen and help problem solve. Not just with the shower thing either.\n\nGood luck. Keep an open mind, listen to your daughter, and take a deep breath when you need it. Outside. Away from the stinky armpits. ;)", "She wouldnt have a complex if she fixed the stinky, NTA\n\nIm a stinky person and I kinda forget about it but I am very open to someone saying I need some deoderant, I aopligize to them  thank them and then take care of it.

YTA for being upset with what you've created.", "YTA Have you talked to her about what\u2019s going on? She sounds incredibly depressed.  Probably best to solve her BO problem by figuring out the cause.", "YTA - the body odour isn\u2019t the problem if she\u2019s dealing with mental health needs. It\u2019s a symptom of that. Stop focusing on how you think she smells and support her in how she feels. If she\u2019s been calling you and your husband emotionally abusive, then there\u2019s more to this story. There\u2019s something greater she\u2019s been experiencing that\u2019s led to her lack of personal hygiene and daily routine, and you haven\u2019t paid attention to it.", "NAH but I mean anything organic that remain in a closed air environment will smell. Does her room have a window? A little fresh air should help. \n\nFor body odor that can be because of a lot of health related things and humans naturally do smell. If the odor is bad I cannot imagine that to be healthy and perhaps should check with doctor just to be cautious. As for emotional abuse I don't know what your intent was or if you guys went overboard", "Nta, as harsh as it is, you are just stating facts and condition", "NTA\n\nAsk your daughter if she'd rather hear it from you/your husband or other people outside the immediate family.  Look, if she stinks, other notice and will tend to leave her behind.", "NTA.

Girls have enough negative energy thrown at them from the rest of the world. Try to go the supportive route and encourage her to take care of herself with good hygiene. My 15 year old son is just the same, but I\u2019m tough and blunt with him because he\u2019s a boy. Carrot or the stick? Try to make her want to make the choice instead of telling her what to do. Just a thought anyway", "No", "NTA - it\u2019s something she needs to be able to pick up on herself, and have it very kindly picked up as you seem to be doing, if she\u2019s not quite noticing it on her own. It\u2019s so socially unacceptable and she\u2019ll have problems down the line, so it\u2019s probably kindest to her her parents say something now. \n\nIt\u2019s also quite unfair on the rest of the household if the smell starts to affect everyone else. \n\nPerhaps it might be worth talking to her about what can be done to make the bathing experience easier? Having heated towels for getting out, different products, maybe having a heater in the bathroom so it\u2019s warm when she gets out, maybe she\u2019d prefer the room darker & lit with fairy lights etc etc", "YTA she\u2019s almost 18, she knows.

I forgave her eventually but, boy, did I make a lot of bad decisions for myself in the meanwhile.\n\nYou made a very wise decision to have a family counseling session. It will be a good opportunity to listen and learn more of your daughter\u2019s perspective. With the help of the therapist, she\u2019ll be able to articulate what support from you looks like to her. And your help will actually become effective. \n\nFor me, the best thing my mom could have done was to acknowledge and accept my feelings. Never to force me to do anything but to believe in me; that I\u2019m the expert of my life and I will eventually know what to do and when to do it.

He complained that anyone who judged him for his car was a crappy person. I told him, it\u2019s a fact of life. Your hygiene and how you present yourself will color how people perceive and treat you.

You wouldn't just let them lay in bed all day. They need to do physical therapy, etc... whatever is prescribed by the doctor. If they just lay around all day, the knee will never get stronger. After ACL surgery, the pain is really bad, but you have to push through it. With depression, their brain is telling them to shut down so they are not always the best at deciding what is good for them.   \n\n\nWe fought through it. That major episode was about 5 yrs ago.
