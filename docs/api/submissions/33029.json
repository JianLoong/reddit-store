Your house, your rules, NTA.", "NTA. I am a Christian raised among missionaries. You don't lead a prayer at someone else's house unless asked to, if you are asked...you speak from the heart but not at length for a blessing, and if the host doesn't ask, you can quietly or silently bow your head and say a prayer yourself over your food without interrupting the rest. I was also taught to stop snd bow my own head if someone else was praying at another table or what have you, but that isn't ever a necessity, it was just a respectful courtesy my parents imposed on our family so us kids weren't noisily interrupting someone else's prayer.", "NTA and on behalf of all those who are tired of having it shoved down our throats (and really, in YOUR own home!), I applaud you.\n\nRefuse to discuss it with anyone, carry on like nothing happened, THEY can all let it go.", "NTA. You were very generous to give him space and time in your own home for a practice you do not share.   \nAll the relatives who are annoyed with you can offer to host next TG and get back into his grace\u2019s graces \ud83d\ude09", "NTA.  Ultra-religious types like Kevin need to be put in their place sometimes.  What were you supposed to do, let him blather on and on endlessly?  It is your house.  You were being gracious to even permit a prayer, and Kevin was taking advantage by trying to be star of his own flipping sermon.  The way he confronted you later was uncalled for, and your response was appropriate.", "You are absolutely NTA!\n\nSomeone once tried this stunt at a dinner my wife and I were hosting at our home (neither of us have any connection to Christianity).  After everyone was seated and the food was served, this person said, \"We like to start with a prayer.\"  I said, \"Well, we don't.  Everyone, please eat and enjoy!\"  Someone else tried to pull this at a no-host dinner we attended at a restaurant.  This person said, \"Let's pray!\"  I said, \"Oh, let's not,\" and turned to someone else and asked them whether they'd seen a popular movie.\n\nHowever, if I am a guest, either in someone else's home or at a hosted dinner, if the host wants to start with a prayer, I say nothing and sit there quietly until they are done.  That's because, as a guest, I will always respect my host's culture and traditions.\n\nI agree with you one hundred percent:  it is rude, arrogant and offensive to impose religious observances on others either in public or in someone else's home.  You're NTA.  Pastor Kevin, on the other hand, is a HUGE AH.", "NTA. You don't have to put up with long winded hate group speeches in your own him. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA.\n\nAs a petty person myself.....you are awesome.", "NTA. You are not the asshole. You\u2019re the Thanksgiving hero! The only thing I would have added is when he said he was going to pray for you, I always say \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Maybe that makes me TA but that\u2019s okay.", "NTA... you're fcking AWESOME!!", "NTA. Top marks for \u2018you can apologize to me later\u2019 \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "NTA. I am a Christian, and I prefer not to hear a sermon while the food grows cold. Matthew 6:7 addresses not piling up words like the heathen do. A short, heartfelt thank you, and blessing should suffice. Host is the one who should designate who, if anyone, offers prayer. At Thanksgiving, my nephew and I each quietly prayed in our seats before eating.", "NTA. Your Thanksgiving meal is NOT Kevin's pulpit. He can stfu and eat. And yeah, I like you.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nIn addition to Kevin being intentionally sanctimonious, he broke his own religious rules. You\u2019re right, Jesus ***would*** have hated it. The pastor should reread the 6th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew for context on why he was in the wrong here.", "NTA. If he wants to give a sermon, he can go to church. Even if you weren't an atheist, it's rude to take over someone else's hosted event to push your own agenda, not to mention keeping 38 other people away from being able to eat hot food. Then his audacity to attempt to pull you aside to chastise you in your own home makes him doubly an asshole.", ">Kevin told me he needed a word with me as if he had some sort of authority in my house. I told him nope you can apologize to me later.\n\nI genuinely laughed.", "NTA. I love stories like this. Good for you, there is being a Christian and being a Christian A hole. I get Christmas will be fun. Reminds of what my aunt did to her cousins husband. \n\nMy aunt hosts TG every year and used to let her Cousins husband say the blessing as he is very religious. One year as he was getting up to say the blessing she talked over him and said her brother Liam will be saying the blessing. This was a shock to the whole family, she had hosted for over 20 years and her cousins husband had always said the blessing. For context we usually have 30-40 people for TG. Her brother stands up and does a simple TG blessing and we all eat. \n\nLater that night as we\u2019re cleaning I ask my Aunt why she stood up like that and shut him down. Turns out her cousin had been diagnosed with cancer earlier that year and had treated her like absolute crap while she was going through chemo. Talking down to her and getting upset that she wasn\u2019t doing her wifely duties, in his mind. Because of her faith she wouldn\u2019t leave him, but she started standing up to him and not allowing him to bully her. \n\nMy aunt said he\u2019ll never say a blessing in her house for as long as she lives. Obviously what she did and how she did it caused a stir in the family. So she told everyone over the next week as people stopped buy pick up their dish ware or called to thank her for hosting as usual. By Christmas everyone knew how shitty her cousins husband was as a husband. He hasn\u2019t been allowed to say the blessing for almost 15 years at any of the family dinners for Easter, TG or Christmas. He also gets the cold shoulder from everyone at these functions. Only the first timers will talk to him for longer than 10 minutes. Everyone else greets him and does small talk with him before they walk away.", "NTA.   Thanksgiving is about gratefulness.   As someone who has eaten many meals cold at relatives' homes because of extra long prayers -- thank you.  If it comes up again, ask a catholic to say grace -- their meal prayer is short and sweet and done by memory so usually recited at double speed;  less than10 seconds, you are done.", ">I told him nope you can apologize to me later. I thought he might have an aneurysm. \n\nYou're my hero and Kevin got exactly what he deserved.  NTA and I wish more people were like you and didn't tolerate the intolerant religious hypocrites trying to force their religion on everyone", "NTA. You were kind to let him do a prayer in your house, when you were hosting. I have some very religious family members. They wouldn't force a prayer in someone else's house, and prayers before meals are short and to the point, which his should have been.", "NTA: How long would you say he went on for? I grew up Catholic and if he went on for more than a minute I'd say he was trying to prove a point.\n\nAlso, remind him of Matthew 6:5-85 \"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on street corners so that others may see them. Amen, I say to you, they have received their reward.\" 6 \"But when you pray, go to your inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.\" 7 \"In praying, do not babble like the pagans, who think that they will be heard because of their many words.\" 8 \"Do not be like them. Your father knows what you need before you ask him.\"\n\nETA: The way we were taught to pray before a meal was \"Bless us oh Lord and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.\"", "Hahaha - well played. That man gave you no respect - you just matched his energy. \n\nAin't nobody wants a sermon when there is a feast to feed 40 people going cold.
