{"id": 32946, "submission_id": "18hj5tx", "title": "AITA: My husband totaled our car and disappeared", "selftext": "So my husband (31M) and I (29F) have been married for a year. No kids. We got into a heated debate last night. He hit a deer doing 60mph, no one was injured but our car was totaled. He was able to drive it home after the accident and called state highway patrol to come out and make a report. \n\nPrior to the accident he had plans to meet up with someone from Facebook marketplace that evening to purchase vintage toys (his hobby). Instead of waiting around for the patrolman to show up, he quietly slipped out the door without saying a word. When the patrolman showed up I was in the middle of cooking dinner, so I went outside to greet him to find that my husband was not there to file a police report that he requested\u2026 \n\nI immediately called him frantically like \u201cwhy in the world would you leave?!?\u201d The officer was not going to take a statement from me, the person calling in the report has to be here. My husband said that he would be back in 5 minutes, he was on his way\u2026 fast forward at least 30 minutes later he arrives back to the house and completes the report and the officer went on his merry way. \n\nWhen we came into the house I proceeded to ask \u201cwhat was that all about? Why would you leave? You had business to take care of!\u201d He was extremely bothered that I would say anything, claiming that it\u2019s not a big deal. I disagree and tell him that I think it is a big deal that he 1. would walk away from an issue like this knowing that he had things to take care of, and 2. That he would be so disrespectful of another persons time that way. He said that he didn\u2019t give a F about that persons time, and he had plans so he wasn\u2019t going to wait around for someone to show up. Plus that officer probably had nothing better to do than sit in our driveway. \n\nI am disappointed with the way he handled this whole situation and actually quite repulsed by his attitude about the situation and lack of a baseline respect for other people\u2019s time. It\u2019s almost like he thought someone else was going to handle this. I told him, \u201cyou need to be a man and handle your shit, the person I saw tonight was a little boy going to buy toys\u201d\u2026 as you can imagine this didn\u2019t go over very well and now he is having a fit saying that all I do is ridicule him and that makes him not want to talk to me. But it seems that even me asking him to take out the trash is ridicule (yes there are underlying problems with this) but that\u2019s for another thread. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just too much of a people pleaser, which is something that I struggle with. Am I the asshole? Was it wrong for me to say anything at all?
