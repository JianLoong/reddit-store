It also states that pet waste is to always be disposed of.\n\nDespite this, my neighbors allow their dogs to use my yard for the bathroom, often. They also have various chairs, bikes, and clutter in my yard. I have gone to my landlord about this twice and she has talked to my neighbors. Despite the fact that our landlord has told them to stop, my neighbors have not stopped using my yard. A week ago I became frustrated and moved the clutter over the fence to the neighbors large yard since it was in my space.

Tell them and your landlord that from now on anything in your yard, gets throw away.  And then do it. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nContinue to message your landlord.

You should mind -- it's your allocated space that you are paying for and you are sending the wrong message if you are allowing them to play there.  It'd be one thing if they didn't have anywhere else to play.  You might be the kind neighbor in that scenario.  But in the scenario you are describing, they are taking advantage of you and your landlord. You should hound your landlord on this issue.  It's their problem to resolve.  And at the end of the day, it's a form of trespass tantamount to them using your living room when they feel like it.", "NTA. If the landlord talking to them has done nothing then they ain't gonna listen to you. Keep the pressure on the landlord and document everything. Try to do it all in writing and get all responses back in writing on what is being done about it.", "UGH!! NTA. They feel entitled to the front yard because it's also in front of their place. You need to visually \"claim\" it. Claim it by making it look like part of your house. Put some stuff like lawn chairs, small table, etc, personal things to make it look like yours.  Let them know if you see their kids things there you will move it to the backyard the first time, hold it inside the second time, and sell it the third time. If they don't clean up the dog poop, pick it up in a bag and empty the bag onto their steps.", "NTA - These neighbors are taking advantage of your good nature. I\u2019m afraid that confronting them would do nothing more than escalate their poor behavior. Best to keep the pressure on the landlord to resolve this issue. If they don\u2019t then you are left to decide if you\u2019ll tolerate the situation or move.", "NTA, but contacting them won't do anything but escalate with people who obviously do not give a shit about you, and that rarely turns out well.  Keep bugging your landlord and keep records.  Depending on your local laws you may be able to withhold rent if the landlord continues to violate the terms of your lease.", "NTA. \n\nAre you able to put a padlock on the gate to the yard, as well as a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign?\n\nPerhaps you should mention to the landlord that if you\u2019re not allowed quiet enjoyment of your \u201cprivate\u201d yard, then your rent should reflect that, and you should receive a discounted rate.\n\nAlso, just brainstorming, but since your lease says that the small yard is \u201conly\u201d for you, thus, under your control, if one of their kids was injured in that yard, would you have any culpability? Allowing the children to play in the yard may signify consent, and with consent, responsibility.", "NTA\n\nDo you have grounds to call police on them for trespassing?\n\nAs for their stuff, I'd take it all and leave them a thank you note and a chocolate bar. They are kind people giving you free stuff. You should not refuse their generous gifts. When they show up wanting it back, pretend you are stupid and thought it must be a gift cause it was in your yard. Rinse and repeat until they get tired. Just make sure you behave like a cute sweet idiot at all times. Sell some of the items (but not all) from time to time to fund the chocolate bars.\n\nFor dogs, just leave the poops in their bin or doorsteps, no packing. Again, nice and helpful dumbass persona at all times. You are just helping them to pick after their dogs.\n\nFor kids, play with them. Teach them swearing, loud annoying games, etc. You are a teacher, I'm sure you know the most annoying behaviours.", "Tell landlord you want access to the back yard, since they are using the front yard (yours). Or you will be deducting X amount from rent, because you cannot use an area you PAY for and keep stepping in their pets waste.\n\nI'd also tell the landlord that from now on, anything left in your space will be disposed of, as they \"abandoned\" it on your property (don't do this, probably not legal, but it may get your point across.)\n\nEdit - do not contact your neighbors. Go through landlord only. Call EVERYDAY that their stuff is in your yard. Tell them they are violating your lease because they cannot get other tenants to follow their lease. It is their job to fix this.", "NTA I had a neighbor like that. Nightmare.", "NTA at all. It's better if you continue to go through the landlord. Get it all in writing and ask how much your rent will be reduced by if the landlord allows this to continue.", "NTA.  Talk to your landlord again and ask him to dispose of the neighbors junk in your yard and if not, then you need a discount in rent since the yard is no longer private.  $$$ talks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
