I just went out to dinner w/ my mom and dad (both 56), I live with them while I got to grad school (me F24). I\u2019m very grateful, I was always taught to have super good manners, & so was my brother. \n\nMy brother (28) is married to my sister-in-law/SIL (27), we just returned from a week long trip to an expensive location that my parents paid for. We stayed at the same house, & all us sibs had to pay for was our plane tickets. I thanked my parent up & down for paying for the rental & pretty much the whole vacation. \n\nWhile on vacation, my SIL assumed we\u2019d be coming back next year & showed off clothes for her baby (that she\u2019s currently pregnant w/) for next year. I found it odd that she just assumed we were going next year, since after all, my parents paid for the ENTIRE thing. Also, it was never set in stone to go next year, & I also never heard her say thank you to my parents. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t just because I didn\u2019t hear it, but my dad insinuated she didn\u2019t. \n\nI went to dinner w/ just my parents last night, & I brought up how I thought it was weird & how I thought it was weird she never thanked my parents. Just to let y\u2019all know, talking poorly about my SIL is a HUGE nono, specifically for my mom, my mom treats her like the daughter she never had (even though I\u2019m her only daughter).  So when I mentioned it my dad agreed but my mom was pissed, & hasn\u2019t talked to me the rest of our time together. \n\nEven in the car, I apologized to my mom for talking negatively about my SIL, but she\u2019s still ignoring me. I made it clear that just because what I thought my SIL did was weird, that doesn\u2019t mean I think she\u2019s a bad person or think down on her. Still, she\u2019s upset w/ me. This isn\u2019t the first time. Not to being up a The Office joke, but if my mom had two bullets & had to shoot someone, she\u2019d 100% shoot me twice, it\u2019s no doubt in my mind. My mom complains about me non-stop to my SIL which I\u2019ve overheard many times, so I don\u2019t have much of a relationship with my SIL. \n\nShe\u2019s also assuming my mom & her mom are paying for this elaborate & expensive baby shower & sends them links to different venues all the time, which I also think is weird. On top of it, my mom blamed MY DAD for my SIL being greedy, & that he put it in her head so he needs to suck it up & pay up. \n\nI\u2019m fed up with this. I hate how I can\u2019t talk to my mother about my SIL, & ngl im jealous of their relationship, since my mom pretty much hates me. I confronted her, but it\u2019s all the same as the past, my mom is mad at me for saying anything negative about my SIL and I\u2019m the bad guy. I gave up a long time ago trying to please my mother, but it still hurts. I feel guilty for upsetting my mom and saying anything in the first place.

You did nothing wrong.\n\nEither your brother is the golden child in the family and SIL the \"golden daughter\" by extension of her marriage or you are worth less because your mom believes in the archaic idea that \"only men can continue on the family name\" making your SIL worth more as a baby factory than you.\n\nYou have probably always been a second class citizen to your mom and just thought it was normal.  I think talking to your dad privately, without your mom, may help you get more clarity on the situation.  Ultimately, you may have to just go low contact with your mom because she doesn't sound like she will ever care about you.", "NTA, but you need to give up on trying to get your mom to love you as much as she does your SIL. Do you realize how messed up that is. Why keep trying to get her affection rather than accept your relationship is broken and can't be fixed. I know that is harsh but your mom isn't interested in being close to you. So you are fighting a loosing battle. All your doing is hurting yourself. Instead you should be focusing on the positive relationships in your life. It sounds like you have one with your dad. Develop that more.", "NTA\n\nJust hang out and do fun stuff with your dad. \n\nMums going to lunch with SIL?\nWatch a game or go for a hike or something with dad. \n\nDon\u2019t miss out on bonding with her cause she\u2019s with SIL, use that opportunity to hang out with and show appreciation for your other parent (who seems to hear you and be on your wavelength)", "NTA! And I honestly don\u2019t see why you should even have to apologize to her. And to completely ignore you over expressing your feelings is just absurd. I know you\u2019re currently staying with them but maybe you just need a break from the energy she\u2019s constantly giving you. I would steer clear of her and SIL when I have the chance. Sucks to say that since she is YOUR mother, but that fact isn\u2019t bothering her, don\u2019t let it bother you.", "It sucks to be the scapegoat. \n\nThe lesson to take from this is that no matter what happens in the future. Never bring up your SIL to your mother again. I can see why you did it, but to your mother you spoke bad about one of her \u2018golden children\u2019 and for that you have to pay. \n\nIt\u2019s tough on you seeing your SIL get all the attention you have never got but you need to stop trying so hard to get your mom to change her mind. She\u2019s not going to and all that will happen is that you are going to become more and more wounded by it. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, you\u2019re the daughter who longs to be loved by her mom, and there\u2019s nothing asshole about that at all.", "Nta remotely but I wonder if SIL is acting the way she\u2019d does because of your mom\u2019s influence. I\u2019d talk to your dad privately next time because ultimately your mom is his problem, not yours. I\u2019m pretty sure he should make you executor of any will, not your mom, btw. She\u2019s hardly a reasonably or fair minded or financially competent person. Also, SIL is benefiting from your mom right now but if that ever stops, I bet she\u2019d cut her off fast.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate that your mother seems to favor your sister-in-law over you. Perhaps it\u2019s because she\u2019s giving them their first grandchild?. Keep the peace, finish your grad school and get out on your own, you may find the absence makes the heart grow fonder, and if it doesn\u2019t, you can always go low contact. When she asks why you are so distant, you can tell her I\u2019m sure she can figure it out. BTW, your mother is an asshole for talking negatively about you to anyone else in the family. Things you say always come back to bite you in the butt.", "NTA but why do you continue? Your parents know how you feel. It's not anything new to them.  So why continue? Makes no sense. Let them be taken advantage of. That's what they want.\n\nAnd baby showers generally are paid for/held by a relative/close friend of the pregnant woman. There's nothing unusual in that. Just be thankful they're not expecting YOU to pay for it.\n\nBTW, what does SIN mean in this context please?", "You are the Family Scapegoat as far as your mom is concerned. \n\nWatch Patrick Teahan YouTube videos on toxic family systems and being the Scapegoat. \n\nLearn how to set and maintain/enforce healthy boundaries with family on youtubes. \n\nYou should be low contact with your mom and your SIL should be an off-limits topic around her. \n\nBe extra nice to your dad and other family members so they don't take your mom's side against you.", "NTA. Your mom is super toxic", "NTA\nYou did nothing wrong your mom is a bad person. I would stop talking to your mom. But from one of your previous post your dad doesn't seem to be much better at best he just lets this which isn't good. It's sad to say but I think it's time to just cut your losses. Your mom sadly has replaced you it really sucks and I'm sorry you have to go through that. It's not your job to make the relationship work you don't have to fight for your moms love and if you do what's the point it's suppose to be unconditional love. Your mom giving you the silent treatment for saying the truth is wild and the fact she talks about you behind your is wild to me. Honestly I would go NC with the whole family because no one is sticking up for you. I your previous post they also where holding you in financial abuse/ hostage. This whole relationship sounds toxic and abusive. You deserve better I could never imagine doing this to my child. I wish you best of luck but for your own mental health leave them behind they aren't worth it. Found family is better there blood family sometimes.", "Girl why the fuck are keeping apologizing she don\u2019t give a fuck about you , never talk to her again let her know that she lost her real daughter stop being dump", "NTA, go LC with your \"mother\", find a good therapist and live your life to the fullest. And I really hope you'll be happy \ud83d\ude0a", "This hits close to home, my MIL treats my BILs and their wives like the sun shines out their asses while my husband seems to always be an afterthought and when he has confronted her she always makes out like he\u2019s being selfish bringing it up\n\nBest thing he ever did was put a little distance between them and live his life for himself. Your mom won\u2019t change so learn to love yourself regardless of her\n\nNTA", "Nta, I had the same problem with my mom when my brother was dating his ex gf... she got the loving mom I wanted and I got the scraps. It's not worth pushing it at this point as it seems like your Dad is on your side.", "Info. Why do you need to say anything bad about your sister in law? It doesn\u2019t sound like she does anything bad to you personally. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have a problem with her. Your problem is with your mom. Do you\u2019ll disagree just about this or about other things as well?", "YTA based on the information you've given. I don't see any evidence from this post that your mother hates you. She's letting you live with her and paid for your expensive vacation. She got upset at you for speaking badly about your SIL behind her back, which is bad manners, so it's unsurprising that parents who taught you say taught you very good manners would get upset about this; that's not favoritism. You say yourself you don't know whether SIL thanked your parents for the vacation or not, but regardless, it seems your parents are extremely generous in general with all of you. You admit to being jealous of their relationship and I think it's coloring your perceptions of everything both of them are doing. Instead of focusing on your SIL, I'd talk to your mother about how you feel left out and discuss what you can do to bond and get closer. Maybe you two can go on a trip with just the two of you for a weekend or start pursuing a hobby together. I think improving your relationship with your mom will do a lot more to help you resolve your feelings than obsessing over what your SIL is/isn't getting, which really isn't your concern to begin with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
