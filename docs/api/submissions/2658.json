She would repeatedly/purposefully crossed boundaries I had in place for myself and my son just cause she could get away with it (would take my son around people I was uncomfortable with him around). After major series of events, hub and I decided that it would be best for all of us to go nc with her, not as a punishment but for us to find peace and to focus on my deteriorating mental health from the constant guilt tripping and gaslighting. I have been no contact for just over a year now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnto my sister. She is considered the golden child who could never do no wrong in the eyes of my mother (and the entire enabling side of the family). She will full on attack someone who she doesn't feel is up to her standards as a person. For example, she will attack me based on my appearance, weight, and claiming that I am lying about being disabled and using it for attention (I have repeatedly shown those who have asked my medical records to prove it). Her reasoning as to how she knows I'm lying? Because she's a medic in the Army and I guess that means that she knows more than my entire medical team I have been with since my diagnosis. Due to her consistent abuse, I completely stopped speaking to her when I was 16 and at 18, I went no contact. A few years ago, I extended an olive branch when she went on deployment and for a while, we were okay and thought that we had moved on from childhood arguments but when I began withdrawing from my mom, the abuse not only started again but had escalated to where I eventually blocked her as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then, I have received messages from other members of the family telling me that \"enough is enough\" and I \"need to let it go cause she's my mom\" or \"everything was a misunderstanding with your sister\" and I have ignored them all because I truly just want the peace in my life. Recently my sister got engaged and has mentioned to my father that she would be open to sending me an invite but knowing how she is, it's her way to manipulate him and make him think that I am this bad person who is refusing to go to her sister's wedding even though she seemingly wants me there (she really doesn't, she has repeatedly said).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter saying no, we do not want an invitation sent and whether there was or not, we would not be attending as there is no relationship with a majority of the people that will be attending, including with the bride and groom and I don't want to walk into a scenario that will be unhealthy for my family or my mental health as well as one that will be filled with unnecessary drama. Now I am receiving messages not only about me being a horrible daughter for what I did to my mom (I'm sure they only know her twisted version of the story) AND for not being there for my abusive sister's wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for going no contact with my abusive family members or do I need to suck it up and \"let it go\"?", "created_utc": 1668791666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyp9jv/aita_for_abandoning_my_mom_and_not_going_to_my/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can only make it your problem if you let them.  Do not argue with them about anything.  Any justification you provide just gives them points to argue.

Speaking from experience, OP, your boundaries are sound, healthy, and need to stay in place.  There WILL be drama if you go and you WILL regret it.

The fact that she does not own her behavior is sufficient evidence that she is likely to repeat it and even double down on the fact that she has rounded up others to join her in her bullying. So, no, with a clean conscience knowing full well who is the AH in all of this- I'll not be there.", "NTA\n\nYour sister and mother seem pretty toxic, I doubt you being at the wedding is going to do anybody any good, most likely it will end up poorly (argument, fight, something).  Just stay the hell out of there.", "NTA. Often other family and friends don\u2019t realize that someone is a narcissist. You know it and you need to set boundaries and hold firm to those boundaries even when others try to guilt you. I have a friend who it took me years to realize is a narcissist. It was after she had children and I began to see the golden child/scapegoat relationships develop that things suddenly clicked. Narcissists can be deceptive. You need to look out for yourself", "NTA.  Keep them all blocked and continue on with your peaceful life.  These people are bringing nothing to your life but misery.  Let them go.", "So either NC and block them or go to the wedding since she doesn't want you to go (ruin her day) and look Fabulous.

If the extended family is only going to abuse you at the behest of your mom & sister, why do you need them?  \n\nSeparating from family can be hard.  It's ingrained in our culture that we're supposed to take whatever abuse our families dish out and not complain because \"family is family\".  BS.  Live your own life, do what you need to do for your own health and happiness.\n\nI don't see what possible good could come of you attending the wedding - or maintaining contact with your mom.", "NTA. There are times in life to be selfish, and when it comes to your mental well-being, be selfish.", "NTA. You have boundaries, they crossed them, time and time again, and you have gone NC with them.   \nBy guess, your mother wanna keep appearance up, and have her \"Happy little family\" around. Or, they need to ask you and hubs for money. Don't go, turn off your phone, and and have a date night with hubs instead.", "NTA\n\nYou have ample reason to cut off these two family members. Remain in contact with whichever other ones you like, but there's no point in trying to reconcile with people who don't even regret how they've mistreated you. Either they don't think it was wrong, which means they're hopelessly abusive and not worth knowing. Or they know it's wrong, but are too narcissistic to apologize, so they're trying to make you do it instead. Same end result, people not worth knowing.\n\nIt's quite simple. Had your life been better or worse without them in it? If better, then you're doing the right thing. If worse, then consider therapy first, reconciliation maybe a distant second (provided your therapist agrees).", "There is no conceivable reason for you to go to this wedding. You don't want to go.

You deserve it.", "\"Now I am receiving messages not only about me being a horrible daughter for what I did to my mom (I'm sure they only know her twisted version of the story) AND for not being there for my abusive sister's wedding.\"\n\nBlock these people.  If you must send them a final message, say something to the effect that they are blaming the victim, and you refuse to listen to flying monkeys.  Your mental health will improve once you stop dealing with any of these people.", "NTA.\n\nThere is no need to go for rounds of abuse from multiple family members. They\u2019re toxic and they do not show any propensity to change.", "NTA I'm 3 years NC with my narcissistic mother and I am in a much better place mentally. Each year has been more healing than the last. But I have received letters and messages from 'flying monkeys' telling me that I was too harsh and she didn't do anything wrong. Whatever story they heard it was nothing like the truth. Family can never understand, they weren't there. Continue to do what is best for you and keep the drama and stress out of your life. Me, I'm really enjoying the peace.", "NTA but I think you need to go on a social media/phone blocking parade. It's obvious that deeply flawed people run in your family. You need to protect yourself from them. NC hard lines, is the only way.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBut block these people! And take your SN accounts private for a bit. They don\u2019t need a way to contact you.", "Ignore those who only have partial info, and it's none of their business anyway.  See your mom, sister and anyone else for who they are - they've fully revealed this to you.  There is no point in trying to mend fences with toxic people."]}
