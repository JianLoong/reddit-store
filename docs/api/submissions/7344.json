It\u2019s very apparent she doesn\u2019t even see the agreement you made as a priority.\n\nAt this point, you need to stop considering her feelings. You need to stop waiting for your mom to change and just jump on adding him to the waitlist. Besides, she never considered yours.\n\nDo not feel bad for not relying on an unreliable person.

It's great that your mom wants to help out, but if she can't keep up with her obligation she makes things much more difficult than a daycare center is.\n\nA word of warning- if/when your child does start going to daycare, make sure you have sick leave.

It doesn't have to be on a scheduled basis, just when she feels like it.", ">Free daycare is never free\n\nIt is starting to feel like that! I love my mom, but might be time to make the decision for her in this case.", "Oooh this is actually a pretty good solution! Didn't even think of that. Thank you!", "She does work 4-5 days a week. She is home on Tuesday, which is when my son is at her place and on Sundays. Every other week she's home one extra day as well, usually Monday.\n\nStores are often closed here on Sunday so I get where she is coming from, but it's honestly annoying. Especially if she cancels last minute.", "The problem would be that, if he gets that spot on Tuesday, he would need to go every week because we'd pay for that day regardless of if he is there or not. So she wouldn't be able to pick and choose if she wants him to come over or not.\nWhich is why I am feeling kinda bad about it.", "He's already in daycare for 3 days actually.

And I know both she and my son love that time together, which us why I felt like TA for thinking about it. \n\nI have no desire to punish her. We are very close and I definitely want to keep it that way.\nI will admit her cancelling annoyed me over the last few months though, but I wouldn't want to damage the relationship because of it.\n\nThank you for the advice! Will definitely propose this!", "I think so too! Toddlers are a lot of work, for sure.\n\nLuckily, we all live only about 15 minutes apart so it's easy enough to meet up over the weekend or something.  Hopefully this will take some of the pressure off.", "Absolutely!\nWe completely understood when she was ill.

Grandma gets to sleep in and the kids get a short day.", "Let her know it\u2019s not personal and maybe show her that she cancelled on x times out of the past x times will help her see the problem more clearly? She may understand when you show her the objective comparison of her reliability vs a daycare. And if she cancels this frequently, sounds like she could use that extra day for her errands anyway", "So here is where you can make a bit of a compromise if you want. He doesn\u2019t have to go just because you\u2019re paying for the day-  yes it\u2019s a waste of money for him not to go; however you can look at like you\u2019re paying for the option of knowing that you have child care while still giving your mom the opportunity to spend time with him when she wants. At this age he\u2019s  not going to miss out developmentally from not going the one day. You just have to be OK with knowing that you\u2019re paying for some thing that he may or may not be using on a consistent basis if that were to be your plan. You certainly don\u2019t have to do that by any means, but it is a legitimate option", "Thank you! \nI feel like she needs that time off as well, which is understandable, of course.", "That is a very good point! If we send him, we have to pay it as well so doesn't make that much of a difference. But it will most definitely save us the headache of finding someone to care for him last minute.", "Yeah, this is why we paid for daycare five days a week when my daughter was small, my work schedule was pretty wild at the time and it was worth paying just to know that we did have the care guaranteed, I realize not everyone is in that position to be out financially, but it has its  benefits  if you are.", "NTA. Shopping is not a reasonable excuse. Either she takes your son with her, or she waits for another day. It sounds like she has no idea and/or no care the impact this is having on you.

Just nicely explain you need it to be reliable and she clearly doesn\u2019t have the time, and it\u2019s totally ok. She\u2019ll still see him.
