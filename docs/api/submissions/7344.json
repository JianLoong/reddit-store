At this age he\u2019s  not going to miss out developmentally from not going the one day.

Our old daycare didn\u2019t mind changing days or adjusting the days but when we switched to a newer daycare, their policy is whatever days are agreed upon, these are the days you go. They have a certain amount of teachers per day depending on how many kids are signed up so it\u2019s not easy to move days around. (It\u2019s definitely a more organized daycare, hence the switch!) We just let them know the daycare gave us 5 days a week option, 2 days a week, or three. We work M-F so we needed to do all 5 days. They will come during the week and will pick her up early and it alleviates a lot of stress for us scrambling for childcare.

I worked at a daycare center for several years and it was the WORST when kids didn\u2019t show up on their planned days. The owner still gets paid but the child to adult ratio means you\u2019re likely not needed. So someone is sent home. Someone who was given those hours and probably needs them since daycare employees make almost nothing.

But NTA for needing reliable care. Your mother\u2019s plans changing are causing you hardship. Tell her she can take your son on some Sundays she has off. That\u2019s more helpful anyways since non work hours childcare is a luxury most families can\u2019t swing. Just spin it to her like she\u2019d be helping and supporting your marriage by spending time with him on Sunday when you\u2019d love alone time with your husband. Then the first Sunday she has the tot bring a thank you card to pick him up, reinforcing that she IS still helping.", "NTA, she's not helping you if she's not reliable, sounds like she wants to glory of providing free childcare one day a week withhout the effort of actually doing it. \n\nIf your budget can accommodate, it would be way less stress and bother to up the nursery days", "I read it as sending your mom to daycare as well.", "True.
