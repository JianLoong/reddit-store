In addition to the totally inevitable effects on skin and hair, mental and physical health issues make it harder to lose/maintain weight, fat deposits shift due to hormonal changes, etc. Someone who is more focused on appearance than your feelings or health is not going to be a good partner as you age. Ultimately, if someone cannot shift at least part their physical attraction to a mental and emotional connection over time and prioritize other things over physical appearance, the relationship is not going to last because we are all going to change.", "He most certainly does not have the \"right\"!
