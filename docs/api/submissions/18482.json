In addition to the totally inevitable effects on skin and hair, mental and physical health issues make it harder to lose/maintain weight, fat deposits shift due to hormonal changes, etc. Someone who is more focused on appearance than your feelings or health is not going to be a good partner as you age. Ultimately, if someone cannot shift at least part their physical attraction to a mental and emotional connection over time and prioritize other things over physical appearance, the relationship is not going to last because we are all going to change.", "He most certainly does not have the \"right\"!

Dictating what another person can or cannot say is extremely unhealthy and that's not how you solve issues like this.

People gain weight, yes, but just saying F you when you yourself have physically changed, is selfish.\n\nAnd for the potential and inevitable downvotes, outside of medical conditions, going from 130 to 160 is not a big deal.  Going from 130 to 180 to 200 or more, you deal with the consequences.

People are within your right to point out if a partner is no longer appearing attractive, but you are also in your right to refuse. The guy was right to point out that he is losing attraction to you, but he also was wrong for the way he did it. The same way that you are right for choosing to ignore it but also wrong to dismiss it as not important.\n\nTake for example beards. I know a few women who absolutely loathe beards.

As much as we pretend to say it isn't, physical attraction is absolutely a part of love. If your partner is starting to make a lifestyle choice that is making them unattractive then you 100% are allowed to mention it, the key point is doing it diplomatically and not hounding them.\n\nReverse the roles here. If it was a guy that was chugging beers and getting a flabby gut, and his girlfriend raised how she was finding him increasingly unattractive and he should try to stop people wouldn't be that fast to shout YTA at her.
