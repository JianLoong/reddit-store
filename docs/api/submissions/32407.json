{"id": 32407, "submission_id": "18bc2ng", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend she will be fired at a job I got her for not performing?", "selftext": "Is it appropriate for me (23F) to express concerns about my best friend's (24F) job performance to her at the medical spa where I facilitated her employment? In October, I was offered a social media position at a medical spa but declined due to time constraints and an inadequate salary as I run my own ECOM business. \n\nMy friend always says she\u2019s in debt and needs to make money and I am all about putting my friends on opportunities. So with that being said, recognizing my best friend's social media skills, I recommended her to the owner, who paid me to provide her with a 30-day training. I consistently vouched for her, and went there with her the first day to meet him and talked her up so much.. and closed the deal for her.\n\nOn my last day of employment, I addressed concerns from the owner's wife about my friends lack of initiative. She expected my friend to go out of her way to make a good impression and work really hard since she would be rehired without me - and she did not. Keep in mind this monthly pay almost matches her other job, for not having to do much work\u2026\n\nThroughout the month we worked together, she didn\u2019t do very much. She didn\u2019t grow the social media at all.. didn\u2019t answer messages from dms, nothing. She filmed videos with me, uploaded them on a google drive for another person on social media team, and uploaded 2-3 TikTok\u2019s.\n\nAt the end of November when I was now no longer working there, I definitely observed a further decline in her social media activity, particularly during her absence in November for a week for thanksgiving. This is a job you can do anywhere too (besides when she\u2019s needed there to film) When I asked her about the recent posts on the spa's social media because I thought she posted it, she admitted to not posting anything. I expressed my disappointment and I emphasized the importance of fulfilling the responsibilities we initially promised to the owner. In a group chat with her sister and I, I had learned she was canceling her second trip to New Jersey (she was just there a week prior), I said oh good! It\u2019s definitely too much traveling (she\u2019s also leaving for a week at the end of December for a cruise - so she would be gone about 3 weeks in a month\u2026.) and then made a comment in jest only to clarify that it was a playful remark. I said \u201cKyle will fire you lmao\u201d\n\nShe became upset, claiming that I had hurt her feelings. I told her that I vouched for her and she really needs to make sure she does the job.\n\nShe now refuses to communicate (it\u2019s been a week) unless I apologize (as told to me by her sister). I find her reaction somewhat dramatic, as my other friends often provide constructive criticism without offense and constantly tell me if my performance isn\u2019t up to par in my own business. It upsets me that someone would ghost me for days like this. I have truly done so much for her (I pay for a lot of her stuff including food, coffee, given her tons of brand new high end makeup products, perfumes, etc\u2026 I have done several math and business assignments for her for school. Literally always go out of my way which now I\u2019m never doing again. I noticed I\u2019m a big people pleaser and shouldn\u2019t vouch without knowing someone\u2019s work ethic lol) What are your thoughts on this situation?

Just in this case, it did not work out quite that well.  In the future, work with the person first and get a good idea of their work qualities before recommending them.", "A lesson i learned at 13(my family had a seasonal business that was usually the first job for a lot of kids in our town) NEVER recommend or help your friends get jobs. You can tell them where there is an opening, but NEVER put in a word or anything, because in a professional setting, it is YOUR reputation that you are putting on the line. Just because someone is an incredible friend, does not make them a good employee. My literal best friend for the last 25 years is a great guy, has been there for me through literally everything in my life, but he cant hold a job to save his life. He will ask me at least once a year for help getting a job delivering parts or something, but he will quit, or not show up for work, within the first few weeks, and ive worked too damn hard for MY reputation to besmirch it.\n\nETA. NTA, But this is a lesson for you more than it is for your friend. Because you are also seeing that your friend doesnt care about your professional reputation. And if you run your own business, that is more important than anything.", "This girl is 24 years old.  STOP paying for things for her.  She is an adult, and needs to pay for herself.\n\nHer not doing a good job can reflect badly on you when you recommend her for a position.  You now know that she isn't a hard worker.  Do not give her any more recommendations.  Also, if she ghosts you when you give her some feedback, she isn't much of a friend.  I would distance myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Wait, you vouched for her w/o knowing her work ethics?\n\nBut why would you do that?

Glad to hear it went well thankfully!", "I also could have negotiated to be my rate I needed I\u2019m sure because he agreed to pay it for us combined the first month but I truly wanted my friend to make money and help her build her career since it would look good on a resume for her. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "Ugh, it really upsets me.", "Yeah :( My personal trainer the same day this happened told me to go get the job back and told to the owner and say I noticed she\u2019s not fit for the position.

I don\u2019t really see this as mothering or dictating? I don\u2019t really care what she does outside of the equation of the job I got her that I vouched for her for.

I'd end up just trying to fade out, or never tell them anything, because it could never just be a simple conversation and i'm allowed to get on with my own thing. You'd try and take charge every single time. \n\nI'm being serious, learn how to be a friend - you can still be a people pleaser if you want, but give everyone their own autonomy to live their lives and know that they can talk to you about issues without it being a hostile takeover.", "yes, she's talking about her life, TO HER FRIEND, that's what friends do, chat about current life situations. Offering the job was great, and it should have stopped there, but you're actively in her life trying to dictate what she does and does not do. You need to take a step back, and learn how to be friends with people and not meddle so much or this ghosting is going to be a recurring theme throughout your life.\n\nNot everything your friends tell you means you need to step in like mother to fix, it just means they are discussing it. A good rule of thumb would be to ask them 'Do you just want to complain, or do you want me to help find a solution?', and stick to what they answer.", "Again, I understand your perspective. I guess I am used to some friends who paved the way like this for me. \n\nShe\u2019s very shy and stand offish. It\u2019s just her personality and she was terrified to meet the owner and talk to him. As I probably should have put in here, she wanted my assistance with this or I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I am not like this with my other friends. The only thing she really hasn\u2019t asked for is me to buy her some stuff- which again is my fault. I am uncomfortable asking for money and when we go out she sometimes doesn\u2019t even offer to pay for her portion or give me the money so I just stay quiet as it\u2019s uncomfortable. She\u2019s asked me on many occasions for help with her school assignments and to do it for her. I didn\u2019t just offer. I don\u2019t try to dictate her life. I am upset about my reputation being put on the line when I assured the owner and his wife several times she is AMAZING at what she does", "Then you've learned a valuable lesson. Next time, you can suggest the job to a friend, let them know it's open and let them apply themselves. You've gone way above and beyond what is reasonable here. \n\nYou're upset because she's not doing the exact thing you told her to do, and now she's ignoring you. Let her go, she's not acting like your friend, but please please learn how to stop going beyond for people, it's going to consistently burn you.", "You are right. I am deff done doing that! I learned my lesson. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "The other hard lesson is that there are friends, and then there are \"friends\" in name only. The latter care more about themselves than you, and will take, but rarely give.\n\nGiven other examples ie not offering to pay for food in the past and wanting school work done without puttingin any effort, if there's a glaring warning sign or say 2 red flags, I'd be extremely cautious in the future dealing with \"friends\". \n\nYou have to be civil. You don't have to be friendly."]}
