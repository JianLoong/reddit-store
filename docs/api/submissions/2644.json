Even if it\u2019s your room. Not a good idea.", "NTA she's a noisy Nelly going through your stuff.", "NAH. I think that while you are grateful for the help in the past you have reached a point in your life where you need more privacy - I feel like this happens to everyone at some point in their teens. As long as you communicate that clearly and thank her for trying to help you are in the clear.", "i truly think your mother shouldn't have been taking stuff out of your room. with that being said if i see a bag with miscellaneous items in it, i wouldn't think it was that important. i would apologize but don't feel like it's all your fault. maybe try to communicate with her and tell her how it made you feel (corny but it may help). just tryna help!", "NAH. This sounds like a totally normal parent-teen interaction.\n\nIt appears your mom was just helping. She didn't double down on her right to go through your stuff and did give you an alternative to her going through your stuff (you doing it yourself). That's a pretty reasonable way to respect your privacy. As you both say, she doesn't have to clean your room for you and if privacy is a growing concern it probably makes sense to stop because cleaning a person's room is always going to be in some way privacy violating even if you try to respect boundaries.\n\nMeanwhile, I totally get why you might feel a need to say something or be worried. It's hard to feel at home when everything and every place you have is exposed. Having privacy can be comfortable and having an understanding about privacy is good. I know for me privacy was important to growing as a person.\n\nSounds like you two are just negotiating privacy going forward. \"Just yesterday\" you were a baby with no privacy and so sometimes you need to help your parents wake up and realize that you're getting to a point where things like privacy might be of growing importance. Talking about it like you did seems normal. Now she knows and you guys can talk about the need farther if it's important. But it doesn't really sound like much of a problem. If anything, go ahead with you being the one to clean your own room now and just tell mom that you didn't mean to snap and hope she understands.", "ESH.\n\nAt 16, you should have been cleaning your room regularly anyway.  Mom should not have been snooping, but maybe she just got tired of vacuuming around the bag.  Does she put other things away like laundry?", "NTA. You're entitled to your privacy.\n\nPrivacy is key to ensuring human dignity, safety, and self-determination.\n\nYour mom shouldn't have thrown something away without asking you first. She didn't know if it was important or not... and that's exactly why she should've asked.\n\nP.S: If anything, it is better that you clean your room now, you control what you want/don't want in there. It's your personal and safe space.", "NTA. She didn't have good intentions when she emptied your bag.", "Perhaps start putting private things away better so she doesn't stumble on them (or so you don't make it easy for her to find if she is snooping.) \n\nAlso, consider why you wouldn't want her to see the thing. Is it your journal where you are writing down your personal feelings (and she has a habit of making fun of you so it needs to be private, or you've had bouts of dangerous depression and she reads it because she's scared of losing you)? Is it evidence you're up to something illegal or immoral? \n\nPrivacy is fine.  But if you are hiding something dangerous to yourself, please reconsider the long-term consequences of your actions and decisions. \n\nAnd, this may be hard to accept, but our human brains don't really mature until we're about 25. So right now, your brain is over confident. It's not your fault or a criticism of you. This applies to all of us. Just try to make decisions slowly and think about consequences and don't let your brain trick you into underestimating the risk or likelihood of a bad outcome.", "YTA. You never had an issue before the bag incident with her cleaning your room. It's actually her home and if you do not want her cleaning it then you should make sure it's clean.", " It sounds as though you were firm, but not rude.  If so, NTA.  If you were rude then YTA.", "NAH Who leaves a bag of private stuff in the middle of the floor?  Especially knowing your mother does this regularly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know what it is about people of a certain age and snooping.", "NTA", "NTA. You're old enough to be responsible for your room. Try to stay on top of your tidying so she has no reason to go in your room.

She's currently trying to play the victim here but you're in the right.", "NTA.\n\nI think you should probably be the one to clean the room going forward though, and you should ask your mum to give you privacy! But part of that is taking on the responsibility of cleaning.", "YTA\n\nIf you don't want your mom messing your stuff, keep it all neat and clean. Don't leave private stuff in random bags, because mom's will totally open it and put whatever is inside the bag away. That's how mom's operate.", "If mom is going in to clean, she isn't keeping it to mom's standards.

It\u2019s one thing to vacuum and put dirty dishes in the kitchen, but another to touch somebody\u2019s things.  I wouldn\u2019t do that to my eight year old niece for something in her bedroom, much less a teenager.\n\nThough frankly, I don\u2019t understand why any parent enters a teens room except if they intend to snoop.  They should be capable of cleaning their own sleeping space by like 10.  And required to keep it reasonably neat and not a biohazard by that age.", "> Your mom shouldn't have thrown something away without asking you first.\n\nThe post says she \"put it away\", not \"threw it away\".\n\n> P.S: If anything, it is better that you clean your room now, you control what you want/don't want in there. It's your personal and safe space.\n\nThis is why I said NAH. As soon as the issue was raised, the mom offered a solution that completely addressed the problem by giving OP privacy. If the mom instead said, \"as a parent and homeowner it's my right to go through your stuff\" she'd be the asshole. But she didn't. She offered to stop cleaning the room (which inevitably means going through stuff) in order to allow OP privacy.", "How do you come to that conclusion after reading the post?

Hope you get better.", "i respect you for replying and i almost fully agree, it's just the way i grew up and and my mother would come in and cleanup with no intention of snooping, and would casually come across something and just throw it in my closet or on my bed, i however, don't know why she threw it away", "Especially if it was at all stinky. She might have thought there was garbage or dirty laundry in there.", "Moving the bag would probably have been fine. Emptying it isn't part of any cleaning routine I've heard of.", "I don't think she threw it out actually, but rather took everything out of a bag that was in a bag and put it all away", "Putting things where they belong is absolutely part of cleaning up.", "Is in a bag not a valid place for things to be? I would consider that to be put away", "You keeping things in a bag on the floor is up to you. Others are more tidy. She had no problem with mom cleaning her room up to this point. Mom therefore did nothing out of the ordinary.", "Wow, nothing makes using bags for storage untidy. I also said nothing about it being on the floor in this hypothetical. I have things such as dedicated bags for my knitting which is a common and tidy storage method, and therefore taking everything out would not be cleaning. Similarly, I know plenty of people who would keep their workbag packed from day to day as not to have to repack it every morning.", "OK! You love bags. I'm happy for you. Apparently  this mother does not.", "So you move the bag, you don't go in and empty a bag within that bag unless it's an established understanding that will happen which sounds like it was not in this case as OP was not expecting it - ie had been done this way before", "You don't know she hasn't put things away for OP in the past. Look this isn't hard. You are really trying to make mom out to be a bad guy. I see nothing here that indicates mom did anything wrong. OP knows her mom cleans up her room. She has never complained in the past. Therefore mom goes in and does the cleaning she sees as being needed. If OP weren't so messy her mom wouldn't feel the need to do so. If OP has something she deems so private she doesn't want her to see it then PUT IT AWAY!", "NTA.   You are 16 and should be cleaning your own room and then she wouldn't have to = privacy.

And b, it\u2019s stupid to have yo clean beyond not a hazard.", "Yea I understand, my opinion still stands. \n\nEven if it's 'putting something away' instead of throwing it away, the bag was inside a box, in the corner, she went out of her way, went through it, and took stuff from there.
