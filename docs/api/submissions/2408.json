I would pay for both of us because she deserves it and supported me through this entire shit show.

I told him the vacation isn\u2019t going to cost more than $15,000 and we can figure out what to do with the rest of the money when the time comes.

As you said this is the culmination of a long and exhausting process and since you don't have any existing medical bills and the issue is largely resolved then it makes sense to spend a little bit on taking care of yourself in the way of that. What of course strikes me is that your husband's plans are all to spend money on himself and his needs", "Nta make sure this money is in an account your husband has no access to.

Then double check with a lawyer about the laws in your country/state/province as to whether lawsuit settlements are marital property.

Was he butchered by a doctor too and left with permanent restrictions like you are?\n\n>and moving back to his hometown because he misses his family. \n\nWell this is a big deal. Most people don't move just because they get $236,000. It doesn't last that long; it's not enough to retire on. Do you both have jobs where you are now and what is the long term plan if you move?  \n\n>The suit started before we were married so as far as I know the money is solely mine\n\nLegally that may be true, but in terms of levels of assholishness here, it would be good to know if you and your husband keep separate money or have just pooled everything since marriage.  \n\nDid he have money before marriage, or has he gotten money like this since marriage, and did he keep that for his own use/purposes or did he immediately give you access to it, like he's asking you to do with your money? \n\nMy mom and Dad shared everything, and if one of them got an inheritance or windfall years after marriage and said \"This is mine, not yours, I'm not sharing it\" that would have been weird.  But other couples keep finances separate, in which case calling something \"mine\" or \"yours\" is much more reasonable. \n\n\n>, and he shouldn\u2019t be able to touch it without my consent, but I\u2019m still worried.\n\nWell then deposit in in a separate account only in your name.

I  got a very nice 2010 Nissan titan around 4 years ago with 74,000 miles on it and have had zero problems with it. It was around $15,000. You're getting alot of money, even if you bought him a $ 50,000 truck, you'd  still have enough money to take your vacation a dozen times. Why is it a waste for you to enjoy a week with your sister to see out some form of a childhood dream but it's not a waste to buy a truck that he doesn't need. Maybe offer to buy a small car that's easy on gas to save money. Since he seems to be worried about spending wisely.\nAlso, do you want to move back to his hometown? Certainly that wouldn't cost 100,000..", "NTA.  I dont think you are wrong for wanting a trip to New York to take your mind off everything youve been through.\n\nI also think your husband is being incredibly selfish, entitled and completely out of line for wanting you to use ALL the money, that you received in compensation for an accident, on him.  Especially since youve been married a relatively short time.\n\nI think you should contact an attorney or post in r/legal to determine if he has any claim to any of the money.  \n\nIn the meantime, i hope you will safeguard the money and put it into an account that only YOU have access to,  because with your husband's extreme selfishness and entitlement, he may steal the money and use on whatever he wants.  It's easier to prevent something from happening than to undo things if he spends the money you may never see it again. I also recommend not making other people aware of the compensation you received so you won't be bombarded with people asking for handouts and loans.", "NTA.

One of my favorite vacation spots. You get 236 k and this clown says a vacation is a \u201c waste of money\u201d. What planet is he from?", "Personal injury settlements are usually not subject to joint property laws in the US.", "Definitely NTA. But personally, I am confused why the trip costs that much. $15,000 got one week seems like an insane amount.", "NTA. This is a highly, highly personal piece of compensation. Normally I would say something about how I think spouses need to agree on finances with respect to income as well as expenses. But this is different to me. \n\nAlso am I missing something or is there still plenty of money left to spend on a truck assuming you want to work with him on that?", "NTA but definitely secure that money in an account that your husband doesn\u2019t have any kind of access or password to. It\u2019s incredibly concerning that he\u2019s already making plans on what to spend it on even though it\u2019s YOUR money. You were a victim of medical malpractice and your body hasn\u2019t made it back to 100% yet, maybe never. He doesn\u2019t deserve a dime of it. It\u2019s your money to spend on whatever you want. Take that trip to NY with your sister and have a great time!", "NTA it\u2019s YOUR money and has nothing to do with him. I can\u2019t believe how entitled he is!\n\nI would ask him why on earth you should be spending most of your settlement for a truck for him when this happened before you were married and had nothing to do with him. Ask him why he thinks YOU shouldn\u2019t get yourself something when YOU were the injured party?\n\nBut also know that any inheritance he receives from his own family should be his and his alone to do whatever he wants with, just like any inheritance you may receive from your family is yours.\n\nDo NOT move back to his hometown! He misses his family but he doesn\u2019t care about what you want! If you move back it will always be about his family and they will invade your personal space etc", "You went through the pain of both a botched medical procedure and a long lawsuit.  You deserve to use the money for what you want.  Everything on his list is solely for him.  NTA and definitely keep the money somewhere he can't access.", "NTA but if you are worried your husband is gonna steal your money you probably shouldn't be married to him.", "NTA\n\nIts yours to do what you wish. its great how he says its a waste when youve always wanted to go there. its not a waste. he doesnt get to tell you what to do  with that money.\n\ntake that trip girl! life is too short not to. put that money into an account that he cant touch. you deserve that money.", "NTA. This is your money and it seems like all his ideas are things he wants", "NTA \n\nReading this made me feel angry on your behalf.  \n\nPlease keep that money in an account in your name only. Your husband\u2019s reaction was frankly disgusting. He wants you to use the money for your pain to buy himself toys??? Anything for you is a waste of money???  This would make me rethink my whole relationship. It\u2019s not just that he immediately wants to buy himself a toy, it\u2019s that he wants to block you from spending any of the money on yourself. That\u2019s a massive red flag.", "See an attorney to make sure this is YOUR money alone. Perhaps your current one can offer guidance. \n\nIt's incredibly selfish of him to dismiss what you want, calling it \"a waste of money\" - YOUR MONEY - and make it all about himself, and what he wants would easily take all of the money and if you split then it's HIS truck and HALF the house. \n\nNTA and please be careful. Hopefully your husband is just really excited and dreaming about possibilities, and opposed to being self-centered 24/7. Is he usually like this?", "NTA. Remind DH that this has been ongoing since before he came into the picture and that the excess money is for your long years of pain and suffering. It is in NO WAY his money AT ALL. It's almost like an inheritance. It is SOLELY yours. Tell DH that it's been your dream for you and sis to visit NY and that you are going. If he continues to throw a tantrum about \"waste of money\" and \"he wants, (repeat), HE wants\", then maybe it's time to reevaluate your relationship with him. Go to NY with your sis and see what happens with DH.\n\nJust FYI: you have proof this suit STARTED before you were married. In the event of divorce he can't claim half as it was a recovery on YOUR behalf, not on behalf of \"the couple\".", "NTA your settlement money is for YOU.", "Take the vacation.  But, you might want to spend some of that money on couples therapy to resolve some apparent communication problems before you end up spending it on a divorce attorney.  There are tons of other questions that could be asked about the nature of your relationship, what agreements you both have on expenses, etc.  You say his truck is old and has problems, is it his only vehicle?  If it isn't a primary vehicle, then I wouldn't bother, but if it's a primary vehicle then is your problem with the truck, or with any new vehicle?  NTA, but I've got a feeling you both suck here for not communicating.", "NTA, so you are not only the person who had to deal with having their body wrong, but all of the stress of this lawsuit, and he thinks none of the money should be spent on you having fun, but immediately on him getting a new truck and going to live with his family??\n\nIt sounds like you should be worried. If you don't have a bank account just under your name at a different bank, you should make one and have the settlement money put there. You should take a vacation after going through all this process, because you're the one who's been dealing with all the mental and physical fatigue. Him saying it's a waste of money for you to get something that causes you Joy is such a red flag. And him only talking about what he wants is even worse. \n\nI think you should take this vacation with your sister, and while you're on that vacation with your sister you should talk about whether or not you and your husband are still a good match, cuz why is he only thinking about himself? And if he wants to move back to live with his family, does that in any way benefit you? It sounds like you two are on a divergent path", "NTA\n\nYou're absolutely fine for wanting a vacation.\n\nI don't think he's in the wrong for being under the impression that it is your (yours and his) money because that's what marriage is unless some paperwork has been signed beforehand.\n\nHe is wrong for calling a vacation a waste of money but viewing a 20k truck for himself is perfectly fuckin' reasonable.\n\nI would take the advice of others and see a financial planner before doing anything. If you act like that money doesn't exist for awhile you could laughing later in life.", "NTA. And if you want some local tips on NYC hit me up. I lived there for 4yrs and go back frequently. \n\nAlso: invest some of the money in an index fund and leave it alone. Buy some nice things, or replace stuff, enjoy life- but if you put a chunk in the market and leave it for 15-20yrs your money will make you money and you'll have long term support. \n\nFor now, take your vacation and treat your sisters. Tell your husband you'll figure out the rest afterward.", "If he wants to go back home...let him. Alone.", "i say send hubby on a permanent trip back to his family alone and they can buy him a truck lol", "this. I would be very careful of moving to his home town OP ....YOU suffered and got money and instead of being happy for you going on a lifelong dream trip HE wants a truck and HE misses hi family. (assuming his home town isn't somewhere amazing you want to live as well but even still HE HE HE)", "Not this \u201csweetie\u201d.  He sounds selfish.", "This right here, like even if you would get some amount of benefit from moving to his hometown, his core motivation is that this is all about him.\n\nI think you should take the sign and see that he is acting single, you two aren't a partnership to him. Don't move back to his hometown"]}
