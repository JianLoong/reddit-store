I would pay for both of us because she deserves it and supported me through this entire shit show. Now my husband is saying it\u2019s a waste of money and we should spend it on a new truck for him (his is old and has issues but he doesn\u2019t actually need a truck for work or anything) and moving back to his hometown because he misses his family. I told him the vacation isn\u2019t going to cost more than $15,000 and we can figure out what to do with the rest of the money when the time comes. We only have around $7,000 in debt so that will be paid off first.

As you said this is the culmination of a long and exhausting process and since you don't have any existing medical bills and the issue is largely resolved then it makes sense to spend a little bit on taking care of yourself in the way of that. What of course strikes me is that your husband's plans are all to spend money on himself and his needs", "Nta make sure this money is in an account your husband has no access to.

Then double check with a lawyer about the laws in your country/state/province as to whether lawsuit settlements are marital property.

Was he butchered by a doctor too and left with permanent restrictions like you are?\n\n>and moving back to his hometown because he misses his family. \n\nWell this is a big deal. Most people don't move just because they get $236,000. It doesn't last that long; it's not enough to retire on. Do you both have jobs where you are now and what is the long term plan if you move?  \n\n>The suit started before we were married so as far as I know the money is solely mine\n\nLegally that may be true, but in terms of levels of assholishness here, it would be good to know if you and your husband keep separate money or have just pooled everything since marriage.  \n\nDid he have money before marriage, or has he gotten money like this since marriage, and did he keep that for his own use/purposes or did he immediately give you access to it, like he's asking you to do with your money? \n\nMy mom and Dad shared everything, and if one of them got an inheritance or windfall years after marriage and said \"This is mine, not yours, I'm not sharing it\" that would have been weird.  But other couples keep finances separate, in which case calling something \"mine\" or \"yours\" is much more reasonable. \n\n\n>, and he shouldn\u2019t be able to touch it without my consent, but I\u2019m still worried.\n\nWell then deposit in in a separate account only in your name.

This is the moment to treat yourself and have a (well deserved) sigh of relief and great enjoyment. Come to NYC (I live here), live your full fantasy with your sister and I\u2019d say, stay longer. Maybe two weeks? It\u2019s incredibly selfish of your husband to demand that the money is spent on him and his truck and his wish to move somewhere else.

I  got a very nice 2010 Nissan titan around 4 years ago with 74,000 miles on it and have had zero problems with it. It was around $15,000. You're getting alot of money, even if you bought him a $ 50,000 truck, you'd  still have enough money to take your vacation a dozen times. Why is it a waste for you to enjoy a week with your sister to see out some form of a childhood dream but it's not a waste to buy a truck that he doesn't need. Maybe offer to buy a small car that's easy on gas to save money. Since he seems to be worried about spending wisely.\nAlso, do you want to move back to his hometown? Certainly that wouldn't cost 100,000..", "NTA.  I dont think you are wrong for wanting a trip to New York to take your mind off everything youve been through.\n\nI also think your husband is being incredibly selfish, entitled and completely out of line for wanting you to use ALL the money, that you received in compensation for an accident, on him.  Especially since youve been married a relatively short time.\n\nI think you should contact an attorney or post in r/legal to determine if he has any claim to any of the money.  \n\nIn the meantime, i hope you will safeguard the money and put it into an account that only YOU have access to,  because with your husband's extreme selfishness and entitlement, he may steal the money and use on whatever he wants.  It's easier to prevent something from happening than to undo things if he spends the money you may never see it again. I also recommend not making other people aware of the compensation you received so you won't be bombarded with people asking for handouts and loans.", "NTA.
