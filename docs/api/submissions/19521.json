Here's what went down:\n\nI'm part of a committee responsible for organizing our school's yearbook. As part of our preparations, we needed to find a printing company to handle the job. One of my classmates, let's call him Alex, told us that his father owns a printing website and could potentially offer us a good deal.\n\nNaturally, we were interested, so I decided to check out the website to get an idea of their services. To my surprise i noticed that in the \"About Us\" section, instead of meaningful content, there was Latin text\u2014lorem ipsum, to be specific. which I thought gave the impression of being unprofessional and unserious. I decided to bring it up with Alex.\n\nI approached Alex and explained my concerns about the Latin text on the website. I emphasized that it might deter potential clients and give the impression that the business isn't taking things seriously. I thought I was doing the right thing by offering constructive criticism and trying to help improve the website.\n\nIn the meantime, since I hadn't heard back from Alex's father's company, I began looking for a backup printing company just to ensure that we would have a reliable option if needed. However, when Alex found out about my search for alternatives, he became even more upset. He felt that I was undermining his father's business and trying to replace them without giving them a fair chance.\n\nAs a result, Alex promptly informed his father about our conversation, including my concerns about the Latin text and my search for a backup company. To my surprise, his father was deeply offended by my remarks and the fact that I was looking for alternatives. Consequently, he decided to withdraw his offer to print our yearbooks.\n\nNow, the committee is blaming me for losing the printing company, and I'm starting to question whether I was in the wrong. They argue that I should have kept my concerns to myself.\n\nI feel like I was just trying to help and prevent any potential issues for our yearbook. However, the negative outcome has made me wonder if I crossed a line and should have handled things differently.\n\nEdit: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my classmate they need to replace the the lorem impsum placeholder text on their \u2018About Us\u2019 page on their website?\u201d\nresulting in the loss of our yearbook printing company?", "created_utc": 1686479954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146qoc4/aita_for_informing_my_classmate_about_latin_on/", "score": 4987, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
