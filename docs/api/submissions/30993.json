You're supposed to be free to speak your mind.\n\nYour parents are living in this little fantasy world where they did everything fine and all is good. Of course they're shocked by what you said. They know better!", "INFO: what did the therapist say? cause it seems to me you were doing exactly what the intent was of family therapy\u2026 opening up to talk about the issues in the family dynamic.", "Welcome to therapy. You did good. NTA", "NTA. You pulled off the bandaid and a lot of pus came out. You didn't cause the wound; you just exposed it and now no one else can deal with it. Harsh, yes, helpful, maybe not so much. The reason the bandaid was there was because no one wanted to or was able to deal with the damage. So I don't think you acted perfectly, but I can't fault you for calling BS in that moment. A softer approach could have accomplished the same aeration without so much backlash.", "NTA. Perhaps the timing was less than ideal, however that being said, therapy is for honesty, and the harshness came from years of bottling up the truth. \n\nPerhaps a few individual sessions would be a better solution, before jumping into a group one, to give the therapist a better understanding of the dynamic.\n\nI mean, what did your father _think_ would happen in therapy?  Sunshine and roses?   If it was all perfect, ya\u2019ll wouldn\u2019t be in therapy!", "Maybe laying it all out in session 1 wasn't a good call, because the therapist hadn't had time to get a groove on, but if you can't say how you feel in therapy, where *can* you?\n\nNTA, but not particularly helpful either.", "NTA.\n\nI don't care if you could have chose your words more wisely or if you could have sugar coated your words better to not hurt anybody - this is your truth in a very sick situation. You think your sister is too weak to even be herself, you think your brother has all that unhealthy incel-stuff, so this is your truth. Aren't you supposed to bring this up in a so-called safe space like therapy? If not, when would you be allowed to bring it up?\n\nI mean, your poor sister has an ED already, and she's pregnant. I understand she wants her parents in her life, but right now these same parents still believe they were somehow ok and wanted you to confirm that and you could not. If she just wanted you to confirm everything will be alright, you could have spared the costs of therapy and lie to her - would have had the same result. No, you did nothing wrong. The people around you are wrong.", "I was still chuckling over the term \u201cproto-incel\u201d \u2026 so I don\u2019t feel I can render  judgment because I find that hilarious.", "\u201canxiety so bad she cries anytime the wind picks up\u201d I take it you get your temperament and tact from your parents?

That about 6 years, it screwed me up, and the older I got the more I learned about how bad the situation was. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not your parents fault they aren't in love, but they need to understand how hard it was for you. And they need to get that their actions screwed you up, in no way is it your fault.", "NTA \n\nThe best time to say all that was in therapy. A safe space where your fathers delusional thoughts can be proven wrong and spoken about, if only he had a stronger mental fortitude and the ability to admit he done messed up big time. \n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If your family wants to stop therapy that\u2019s on them. For the sake of you and your siblings though, I recommend that y\u2019all keep up with it especially your brother the aspiring incel and Lena who appears to have near crippling anxiety.", "NTA. Saying those things at a therapy session was exactly the right thing to do, because there's a therapist there to help you work through them! If dad doesn't want to go again, that sounds like he's heavily in denial, but maybe it would be good if the rest of you could continue to go.", "NTA\n\nYour dad refuses another session because its a place where everyone has a voice.  He wants you to be voiceless.  Fuck that. \n\nA lot of parents do exactly what he does.  Say everything is fine, get shitty if you don't go along with it, start with the excuses.  \n\nExcuses not withstanding, parents dont all do an excellent job.  I'd say most do a shit job or worse.", "NTA, definitely NTA. You did nothing wrong, your parents messed you up badly due to how they misshandled their relationship, ignoring how that affected you, and your dad kept playing the \"It's fine! We did a good job with our kids, raising grandchildren is gonna be a piece of cake!\" and you simply just pointed out the big elephant in the room that he refused to admit.\n\nYou didn't ruin anything: your dad's feelings aren't hurt, his ego is, that's why he is insulting you and demanding an apology. FFS, if you kids had turned out fine, you wouldn't need therapy in the first place. You do NOT have to apologize for being honest during therapy, this is what therapy is for, to reach the source of the problem and work with it. The fact that your dad refuses to go back to therapy again shows that he refuses to admit he did anything wrong and his pride got hurt. And your sister is using you as the scapegoat to blame you instead of your father. Also, in what part is cruel to say that stuff about your siblings? You didn't insult them, you pointed out the difficulties they had in consequence of their parenting, that's not an attack towards them, it's pointing out your parents' mess, which is different.", "I agree, NTA. OP said it herself, it was bad timing. But it was needed as a hopeful wake up call to your parents. The fact that your father demands an apology already bursts that hope imo. Anyways good luck!! I hope things get better for you OP.", "I was just thinking that sounds like a great first session , getting everything on the table....\n\nbased on the info im gonna say nta. op could've been nicer to your siblings, but also the whole point of going to family therapy is to say what you actually think within a mediated space. OP shouldn't have been invited if no one was ready to hear and grapple with what they had to say.", "I used her own phrasing for that, actually. She knows she cries a lot and that\u2019s how she describes herself.", "I agree. Saying something is fine and seems warranted. The way OP said it is AH behaviour.", "And your description of your brother?", "Is entirely accurate. He\u2019s been suspended for rage meltdowns this year and spouts literal incel talking points.", "NTA The fact he wasn't open in therapy says all you need to know! Seriously it's a safe space as long as we don't bring up the real issues that could help. They made your point perfectly. It sounds like your the only one thinking straight and trying to tackle that issues instead of pretending.", "NTA \n\nTherapy is THE place for that brutal honesty. You can't fix a problem if you keep denying it exists.", "NTA You weren't criticizing your siblings. You were pointing out their issues and criticizing your parents role in them. \n\nask the therapist about DARVO. it stands for deny, attack, reverse victim, and offender. it\u2019s a classic abuser technique they\u2019re trying to use on you.", "NTA, given that it\u2019s pretty clear where you stand with your parents Im unsure why they were surprised. tbh they probably weren\u2019t they were probably just embarrassed you Exposed Them in front of a stranger (despite this being probably the most helpful thing the therapist heard). Some of the best work i\u2019ve personally done in therapy has been from my therapist straight up calling me out on my bullshit. sounds like they weren\u2019t actually ready to confront or fix their own issues or be accountable for parenting (or lack thereof). I would encourage you and your siblings (brother seems like a questionable prospect at best) to all get individual therapy even if the family therapy doesn\u2019t continue, it sounds like you all need it (not in a negative way, just in a therapy is really helpful way)", "NTA but in an appropriate amount of asshole way to make your point. Therapy is for honest talk and I\u2019m sure the professional that was in the room can give you feedback on how the interaction could\u2019ve went differently, not me.", "Dad wasn't looking to improve.\n\nHe had his position set/stated in that session and he's using your comments to opt out because of his hurt feelings\n\nNTA for stating the real problems(at least as you perceive them).", "I feel this incredibly hard. Not my exact background, but the vibe of this therapy session, haha.\n\nSoooo NTA. I'm glad your parents are choosing to be there for Lena and are going to therapy, but if they think everything is fine they are a long way from fine themselves.\n\nGod! My mother's partner once made a comment that he thought their relationship was good because they'd been together 10 years or something at that point. Spoiler: it is not good. I still think about that and shake my head, and it's been another 15 years of toxicity.", "NTA. If not therapy, where was this supposed to come out. The whole bad timing thing is nonsense. You all went to therapy to try and work shit out. The only way to do that is to put shit out on the table.", "NTA - it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t include yourself in the description of their kids.  \nYou weren\u2019t just saying bad things about your siblings.  \nParents everywhere need to learn that most of the time their children are a product of their upbringing", "NTA therapy was never gonna work unless everyone participating is living in reality", "NTA. Sometimes you gotta say what\u2019s on your mind", "You appear to be unaware of your own responsibility for your healing. Also you are being presumptuous that your siblings are not okay because they have flaws that you define as being a product of their failures. Nobody should feel like they are entitled to a life of privilege and comfort in order to be seen as a good upbringing.", "ESH. Obviously your Dad isn\u2019t willing to accept any blame for anything if he\u2019s not willing to work through issues. And there\u2019s clearly past issues that should be addressed in a healthy way.\n\nHowever you can\u2019t speak for your siblings especially since it sounds like you\u2019re estranged. I\u2019d be upset too if my estranged sibling just assumed she knew how I felt or labeled me with such a poor relationship.\n\nSounds like you need to just check out of the family. Your opinion of them is clearly very low and you\u2019re unhappy around them.\n\nDefinitely sounds like you need personal therapy as does your family.", "NTA I feel your pain. My parents went through a very volatile divorce when I was 8 and my sister was 6. She doesn't remember much, but I sure do.", "YTA. You have an attitude because your parents divorced and your world wasn't absolutely perfect? Toxic as hell. Do them a favour and move far away.", "YTA \nThose are opinions.\n\nPeople define success in different ways", "NTA - Unfortunately most parents need to hear that, no actually your \u201clittle angels\u201d have severe issues they need to work through now almost entirely due to how you raised them.\n\nMy dad tried pulling the EXACT same card on my brother and I at dinner one time. I was like \u201cDad, your son\u2019s a homeless alcoholic and I only seem good to you because I DONT LIVE WITH YOU AND HAVENT FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS!!!\u201d", "NTA\n\nAnd never apologize for telling the truth, even when it hurts.", "What is a proto incel?", "I think I'm going weak YTA here. Not for the sentiments you stated, but the lack of tact.\n\nFrom your text it seems like the purpose of the therapy session was to work towards a way for your parents to be able to work together and work with your sister to help with her children. \n\nYour way of challenging your fathers statement seems like it went counter to that goal.\n\nWhat you said seems like it's right and a reality check that your parents need.. but probably aren't ready for yet and the way he was challenged probably set him into a hard defensive posture that's going to be hard to back down from.\n\nNow.. He's an AH and your reaction seem very reasonable and motivated... but maybe not so very helpful to the goal.", "NTA and family therapy isn't meant for BS fantasies. It's about facing reality. They needed to hear it.", "NTA tell your sister you are happy to skip the next session if it makes your parents feel better. Do not apologize. The correct response to people demanding an apology is to tell them to duck off and take a break from them. \n\nReally you don\u2019t need that \ud83d\udca9 in your life.", "I can guarantee you that the therapist was thinking \"this is either going to put all my kids through college or I'm going to be fleeing to raise goats in Vermont.\"", "Also wtf \"bad timing\" ?!\n\nTherapy is EXACTLY the timing to bring up this sort of thing! NTA", "Things got heated after that and the therapist was trying to deescalate I think so we never got back around to it.

How presumptuous.", "I mean, comparatively, my life is healthier and more on track than either my siblings or my parents. I support myself entirely, I\u2019m in grad school, I have generally made sound and productive life decisions, I don\u2019t let my parents push me around, I tried to be there for Mark and Lena as much as I was allowed to be, and at worst my toxic trait is I have trouble letting my guard down and allowing people to do things for me. I haven\u2019t done shitty things to my spouse or children. I haven\u2019t channeled my issues into hating specific groups of people and screaming and throwing things. I don\u2019t hurt myself and crumble at the slightest imagined hint of adversity. My siblings\u2019 issues are not their fault, they were too young to protect themselves and our parents had more time to screw them up after the divorce.

If I had had to live 8 formative years with all that and no recourse, I\u2019d be a mess as well. I went the opposite direction to them because I\u2019d already had a chance to build some resilience and sense of self. That\u2019s the difference as far as I can see.

This whole concept of \"tone\" and blowing sunshine up people's assets is toxic.", "In fairness, OP is not the parents, and is currently independent; they are not responsible for their sibs' problems and can't fix them.
