It's important to acknowledge the impact of their actions on their children's lives. Your comment was harsh, but sometimes the truth hurts. Hopefully, this will be a wake-up call for them to address the issues that have affected your siblings and work towards healing and better relationships. NTA.", "NTA. This is therapy. You're supposed to be free to speak your mind.\n\nYour parents are living in this little fantasy world where they did everything fine and all is good. Of course they're shocked by what you said. They know better!", "INFO: what did the therapist say? cause it seems to me you were doing exactly what the intent was of family therapy\u2026 opening up to talk about the issues in the family dynamic.", "Welcome to therapy. You did good. NTA", "NTA. You pulled off the bandaid and a lot of pus came out. You didn't cause the wound; you just exposed it and now no one else can deal with it. Harsh, yes, helpful, maybe not so much. The reason the bandaid was there was because no one wanted to or was able to deal with the damage. So I don't think you acted perfectly, but I can't fault you for calling BS in that moment. A softer approach could have accomplished the same aeration without so much backlash.", "NTA. Perhaps the timing was less than ideal, however that being said, therapy is for honesty, and the harshness came from years of bottling up the truth. \n\nPerhaps a few individual sessions would be a better solution, before jumping into a group one, to give the therapist a better understanding of the dynamic.\n\nI mean, what did your father _think_ would happen in therapy?  Sunshine and roses?   If it was all perfect, ya\u2019ll wouldn\u2019t be in therapy!", "Maybe laying it all out in session 1 wasn't a good call, because the therapist hadn't had time to get a groove on, but if you can't say how you feel in therapy, where *can* you?\n\nNTA, but not particularly helpful either.", "NTA.\n\nI don't care if you could have chose your words more wisely or if you could have sugar coated your words better to not hurt anybody - this is your truth in a very sick situation. You think your sister is too weak to even be herself, you think your brother has all that unhealthy incel-stuff, so this is your truth. Aren't you supposed to bring this up in a so-called safe space like therapy? If not, when would you be allowed to bring it up?\n\nI mean, your poor sister has an ED already, and she's pregnant. I understand she wants her parents in her life, but right now these same parents still believe they were somehow ok and wanted you to confirm that and you could not. If she just wanted you to confirm everything will be alright, you could have spared the costs of therapy and lie to her - would have had the same result. No, you did nothing wrong. The people around you are wrong.", "I was still chuckling over the term \u201cprotocol-incel\u201d \u2026 so I don\u2019t feel I can render  judgment because I find that hilarious.", "\u201canxiety so bad she cries anytime the wind picks up\u201d I take it you get your temperament and tact from your parents?

That about 6 years, it screwed me up, and the older I got the more I learned about how bad the situation was. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not your parents fault they aren't in love, but they need to understand how hard it was for you. And they need to get that their actions screwed you up, in no way is it your fault.", "NTA \n\nThe best time to say all that was in therapy. A safe space where your fathers delusional thoughts can be proven wrong and spoken about, if only he had a stronger mental fortitude and the ability to admit he done messed up big time. \n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If your family wants to stop therapy that\u2019s on them. For the sake of you and your siblings though, I recommend that y\u2019all keep up with it especially your brother the aspiring incel and Lena who appears to have near crippling anxiety.", "NTA. Saying those things at a therapy session was exactly the right thing to do, because there's a therapist there to help you work through them! If dad doesn't want to go again, that sounds like he's heavily in denial, but maybe it would be good if the rest of you could continue to go.", "NTA\n\nYour dad refuses another session because its a place where everyone has a voice.  He wants you to be voiceless.  Fuck that. \n\nA lot of parents do exactly what he does.  Say everything is fine, get shitty if you don't go along with it, start with the excuses.  \n\nExcuses not withstanding, parents dont all do an excellent job.  I'd say most do a shit job or worse.", "NTA, definitely NTA. You did nothing wrong, your parents messed you up badly due to how they misshandled their relationship, ignoring how that affected you, and your dad kept playing the \"It's fine! We did a good job with our kids, raising grandchildren is gonna be a piece of cake!\" and you simply just pointed out the big elephant in the room that he refused to admit.\n\nYou didn't ruin anything: your dad's feelings aren't hurt, his ego is, that's why he is insulting you and demanding an apology. FFS, if you kids had turned out fine, you wouldn't need therapy in the first place. You do NOT have to apologize for being honest during therapy, this is what therapy is for, to reach the source of the problem and work with it. The fact that your dad refuses to go back to therapy again shows that he refuses to admit he did anything wrong and his pride got hurt. And your sister is using you as the scapegoat to blame you instead of your father. Also, in what part is cruel to say that stuff about your siblings? You didn't insult them, you pointed out the difficulties they had in consequence of their parenting, that's not an attack towards them, it's pointing out your parents' mess, which is different.", "I agree, NTA. OP said it herself, it was bad timing. But it was needed as a hopeful wake up call to your parents. The fact that your father demands an apology already bursts that hope imo. Anyways good luck!! I hope things get better for you OP.", "I was just thinking that sounds like a great first session , getting everything on the table....\n\nbased on the info im gonna say nta. op could've been nicer to your siblings, but also the whole point of going to family therapy is to say what you actually think within a mediated space. OP shouldn't have been invited if no one was ready to hear and grapple with what they had to say.", "I used her own phrasing for that, actually. She knows she cries a lot and that\u2019s how she describes herself.", "I agree. Saying something is fine and seems warranted. The way OP said it is AH behaviour.", "And your description of your brother?", "Is entirely accurate. He\u2019s been suspended for rage meltdowns this year and spouts literal incel talking points."]}
