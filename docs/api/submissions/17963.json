What we do is to stay in bed and try to recover the physical and mental toll pregnancy did on our body.\n\nSo I've moved to my husband's country and it's not a widely done thing here apparently and I've already take 2 months off from work. Ive talked to my husband about this but he thinks it's very unnecessary, especially since I need someone to take care of me and the child during the period.\n\nSo here's why I think is feasible\n1. We make really good money so it's not going to make a big dent on our financial account\n2. I can just have my parents take care of me\n3. My company has really good employee benefits so even if i take that extra month off it will still be under parental leave. \n4. My states have parental leave for guys too so my husband can also stay home to spend more time with our daughter and me.\n\nBut my husband was really against it and i do want to acknowledge it might be very troublesome to extend my parents visa.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if i bring up this topic again? His white American with Irish descent if that matters.\n\nEdit: I tried talking about it before but it was shut down and i thought it was fine and I could go without one. but my pregnancy wasn't smooth after 6th month mark and instead of natural birth we are now going c section and Alot of stuff happened especially within the last few week so now I'm pretty adamant about getting this one extra month of rest.", "created_utc": 1684832225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pivs8/wibta_to_expect_my_husband_to_accommodate_a_post/", "score": 1462, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You DEFINITELY have a right to want post pregnancy recovery and if you can swing it, good for you. I\u2019d personally continue trying to persuade my husband on this if I were in your shoes.\n\nIt seems like your husband may not understand the cultural practice, and that may be why he\u2019s being dismissive of it. More info is needed on that. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s being a straight up AH, though. He probably just needs some perspective on your situation.\n\nMy advice is threefold:\n\n1. The time you have with that newborn baby goes by in a blink, in large part bc you will be a newborn mother. It takes a LOT of figuring it out as you go and as your body is healing. You\u2019re going to be physically and mentally exhausted for a little while. So it\u2019ll be a blur. But you\u2019ll also probably always look back at the pictures of your tiny daughter and wish you could have just one more day with her while she was so small and snuggly and innocent. You almost certainly won\u2019t look back and think \u201cI should have gone back to work a couple of weeks sooner.\u201d\n\n2. When it comes to postpartum, expect the unexpected. I planned on being a working mom, but the second my first baby was born I knew I wasn\u2019t going back to work for a while. I also know mothers who had the opposite experience as me. I had one super easy newborn and super easy recovery, and I had a super challenging newborn and I\u2019m STILL recovering almost 9 months later. So you just never know. You and your husband will likely have unexpected shifts in your thoughts and feelings once the baby arrives. It can be hard, but it\u2019s normal.\n\n3. Because of the physical, mental, and emotional toll that comes with childbirth and raising a newborn, one of the best things you can do for your family is have a solid plan for your postpartum care. You won\u2019t want to be fighting about this with your husband. You\u2019ll both be very vulnerable at this time, but you especially. I\u2019ve seen resentment over postpartum care disagreements last for lifetimes. COMMUNICATE WITH HIM NOW. You may not have the capacity to do so when the baby arrives. Come to an agreement, and commit to sticking with it. It will be your safety net. Everyone in your family will need it. Once the baby is born maybe you\u2019ll decide you want to go back to work sooner than planned, or he will dread the thought of putting your daughter in daycare. Revise the plan then. But you should not go into the postpartum period with shaky plans in place.", "Cultures who practice this type of confinement have a lower rate of postpartum depression. The reason is pretty obvious. Women need time to recover their bodies and to be able to bond with their babies without added pressure of working", "NTA\n\nI think this tradition is something that should be recognised and practiced everywhere. I don't have my own physical experience of pregnancy and post partum, but I know how difficult and straining it is when you try to recover and take care of a newborn at the same time. And, after all... sorry OP's husband, but she was literally making a new person using her own body resources, and then will have to go through an exruciating pain of a childbirth, especially that labour can take many exhausting hours.\n\nI would understand if there were financial obsticles, but it doesn't look like it.\n\n>he thinks it's very unnecessary\n\nSorry OP, but I would get absolutely mad if I were you. Just do it - it is your traditiion derived from your culture, there is no reason not to. Especially that you thought of all needed arrangements.\n\nSo, why does your husband thinks 'it's very unnecessary' or is against it?...", "Please please, bring that habit overseas and advertise it. It\u2019s really needed. The USA needs to accept maternal care, healthcare, disability care and other terms of care bcs society is combusting in front of our eyes without it.", "NTA.

You\u2019re giving birth, even if everything goes smoothly, you are bringing new life into the world. \n\nMy grandmother\u2019s generation stayed in bed for a solid 2 weeks after birthing her babies and then did extremely light activities while still on bed rest until the post birth bleeding stopped. Activities like knitting and mending clothes.\n\nMoms generation stayed in bed for a solid week and then light activity for 3 weeks - though hers was longer because she had a c-section with me. \n\nThe women in my family who have had babies in my generation keeps trying to jump right out of bed too soon and have a hard time keeping a routine and healing after the birth. \n\nResting helps allow you to heal faster and a chance to bond with the baby. \n\nWomen have between 30-50% more blood in their system while pregnant. That\u2019s between 1-2 litres of blood that has to go after the birth. Post birth bleeding usually takes 4-6 weeks, but can take longer. That is a lot of blood to be leaving your body.

Everything hurts, your emotions are batshit and then let's not even talk about what happens to your boobs - it's a shit show and everyone tells you to rest and eat well... Who TF is going to care for your child and make you meals etc... ? For the average person, noone is around except maybe husband for a couple days then he is back at work, and let me tell you, it's rough. My husband was home with me for a week, and then his leave was up and it was back to the usual routine, except now I had a newborn to care for on top of laundry, cleaning, cooking etc.\n\nI'd take the confinement and care ANY DAY if it was an option for me, and it sounds wonderful to have that sort of support. Your husband will never understand the beating you take from giving birth, and I hope he gets with the programme and gives you the support you need.", "NTA, although I may be bias as this is my culture as well lol. From what I hear this is really important for mothers body to recover. Some women even hire a cook to cook postnatal confinement month meals aka ginger in everything. Perhaps google the benefits of it and share it with your husband, so he can better understand? Have to go with NTA but if he doesn't agree he might be TA. Congrats on the baby!", "NTA.\n\nYour expectation to take the best care of your mind/body/etc. and to follow the harmless, established norms of your cultural identity are perfectly acceptable. It won't be a financial hardship. You know that this is new to your husband, so you gave him options: \n\n1) Your parents can do all the work.\n\n2) You could hire professionals. \n\n3) Your husband and fewer professionals could split the work.\n\n4) Your husband could do all the work. \n\n\nOne thing I learned as an autistic kid (whose \"preferences\" are occasionally non-negotiable) is that, when trying to find a compromise between two people, you should always factor in how intensely each of you feels about the issue at hand. For example, trying to pick a restaurant. My vote is for Mexican, but not for any particular reason. On the other hand, my friend's favorite dish at her favorite restaurant just came back into season, and she's been waiting until payday to go eat there. Everything else being equal, we obviously go to her restaurant.\n\nYou will have spent 10 months growing a human inside of you, throwing all of your body systems into change and chaos. Then you'll have spent who knows how long pushing it out of you. This process can cause all kinds of physical damage in the best circumstances. Unlike Western/American culture, the culture you grew up in respected and honored this by allowing for your full, multifaceted recovery. This is very significant to you with regard to your physical and emotional health and your identity. Not only will the lack of this process be detrimental to you in several ways, but your husband's and in-laws' attitude about it combined with successfully denying you this process will damage your relationships with them and will leave deep scars of disrespect and denigration upon you.\n\nNow compare that with the husband's objections, which can be summed up as follows:\n\n- I can't do everything myself (accurate and reasonable) \n\n- I don't want people in my house\n\n- I don't like Chinese food\n\n- Having in-laws here will be uncomfortable \n\n- We don't do that here.\n\n\nNow compare the two perspectives. Who has a bigger stake in this? Who will be impacted more by the consequences of this decision? Etc.\n\n\nI didn't even get to the implications of this regarding trying to raise your children in a way that includes and celebrates both your and your husband's cultures.\n\nIf you fold now, about something of such enormous importance, you'll never stand up to future denigrating from your husband and in-laws.", "Your husband may also be concerned about being able to bond together as a family, just the 3 of you. With 2 extra people in the house for weeks on end, if it were me I\u2019d feel like it wasn\u2019t my house. I would want to be gone as much as possible. The cultural differences mean he\u2019d be working hard just to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s very challenging to step into a new role like being a dad with  MIL & FIL watching every move you make.

What we do is to stay in bed and try to recover the physical and mental toll pregnancy did on our body.\n\nSo I've moved to my husband's country and it's not a widely done thing here apparently and I've already take 2 months off from work. Ive talked to my husband about this but he thinks it's very unnecessary, especially since I need someone to take care of me and the child during the period.\n\nSo here's why I think is feasible\n1. We make really good money so it's not going to make a big dent on our financial account\n2. I can just have my parents take care of me\n3. My company has really good employee benefits so even if i take that extra month off it will still be under parental leave. \n4. My states have parental leave for guys too so my husband can also stay home to spend more time with our daughter and me.\n\nBut my husband was really against it and i do want to acknowledge it might be very troublesome to extend my parents visa.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if i bring up this topic again? His white American with Irish descent if that matters.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's common practice in parts of africa too  in my grandparents time it was not unusual even in eastern europe.\n\nEven among western countries, the USA is pretty unique in requiring new parents to go right back to work (so that even when the option to stay is there its seen as an uneccesary luxury). in europe the mom wouldnt stay in bed but she would definitely get time off from work guaranteed by law.\n\nthe problem is **pragmatic feasibility**. Normally this sort of thing involves the extended family pitching in to help  while the mom recovers (and hence, *not* dumping all the childcare & household chores on the new father) so if it's just him it might be very difficult.\n\nIf he can take time off from work but doesn't, I'd ask him why that is - is he afraid that his boss will penalize him (in that case he can't help it), or is it some cultural attitude or belief that he has?\n\nPaternity leave is NOT a luxury:  It is actually important for proper bonding that the non-birthing parent (usually the father, but also adopted moms) spend significant time holding the infant. at least 20 daily minutes of skin contact is recommended, smelling the baby can also help. This makes parental hormones & instincts kick in (yes, men have them too!) - Most dudes who take time off to be with their newborns are super glad they did it.\n\nIn the USA (and to a lesser extent all the west) there is this trope of fathers being bumbling, useless & not knowing what to do with babies and/or emotionally distant, and while *some* of it is sexism or laziness, the deck is stacked against these men because the society doesn't value giving them a chance to bond with their children. Staying home with the baby & caring for them while you recover is in his interest as well - again, *assuming* he can take the time off without risk to his job & your parents ensure he isn't overwhelmed with tasks. \n\nWe're not chinese but we've read of practices like this in other countries & if my sisters (or my brothers future gf) ever have a baby we're so making sure one of us (or mom, if she's still fit enough) can come stay with her to help so she can focus on recovering & bonding.", "NTA, please find a way to be confined.

Can't judge, who is correct.\n\nHow many people will be OK to spend months   with parents in law?   Will OP agree to live with her MIL  from 2nd month onwards \n\nLastly,  do we know, if parental leave for father is with pay or without pay    and for how many days?   Normally fathers don't get same leave facility as mothers.", "But his body isn\u2019t going to go through the major trauma of pregnancy and childbirth. What don\u2019t you understand about that?", "This is about her body. And him *not* wanting to do something that will benefit his wife's recovery, allowing her to better bond with and ultimately care for their baby. And him taking leave would help his bond with her and their baby. He'd be cutting off his nose to spite his face. My company offers four months parental leave for both parents and many men take advantage of it and are encouraged to do so.", "Ah yes, the wife stitch", "Maybe it\u2019s one to make it ribbed for her pleasure?", "I actually first learned about this on tiktok, where a lady was describing her experience in a \"Chinese confinement center\", which is basically a hotel-spa situation wherein this 1 month rest can be done. The confinement center had special massages and spa treatments for the moms, room service 5 meals a day, and trained nannies who'd care for the babies -- and teach the first time moms how to do so.n", "Why?   Am I asking some hard questions?", "Yes,  but waiting for OP's conformation that she is going to get all thses by paying 4000 + living expense of a person per month.", "and super weird that she's sorta bragging about it.  No lady, your husband did something awful to you.", "OOP: I want to be allowed to rest while I\u2019m bleeding like hell out of a giant gash in my womb.\n\nOOP\u2019s husband: No.\n\nYou: How do you know he doesn\u2019t compromise? He\u2019s entitled to his own culture and his should override hers!", "Lol yes. I say this as a white woman in an interracial marriage. People in my life are great at policing other cultures!", "As a woman, with many woman friends, like to, most are going stir crazy by 6 weeks at home.  They are sad to leave their babies, but being a stay at home parent isn't for many.", "What do you mean who is correct. He thinks it's an unneccessary expense, as in, they don't need to spend that money on this. They can afford it, the husband isn't even saying they can't. He just thinks there's no need.\n\nOP moved away from her family to an entire different country for him. I can honestly and truthfully say that if my husband moved countries for me and his parents needed to visit for two months, I would suck it up for him.\n\nAlso no one is saying he should think it's his favorite thing in the world. This situation might not be what he would love to do most. \n\nBut that doesn't give him the right to deny his wife the care she prefers after having his child. \n\nEither she gets her way or he gets his way, and if his only argument is \"I don't think that is necessary\" and her argument is \"I just went through nine months of pregnancy and childbirth, risking my health body and life, and I would like to take two months to recover the way I'd do in my home country\" why should his opinion be the most important?", "Do you need to have a baby to go there? Because that sounds amazing.", "That sounds amazing, too bad there probably aren't any where OP lives. Although I believe I saw a show on PBS with an American service that at least cooked and delivered the traditional Chinese healing soups to new mothers.", "No need to keep harassing OP about it. If you want more details about confinement, just Google it. It's easy to find more information.", "You\u2019re asking questions that have been already answered in the post. Can you not read?", "No you're being annoying and asking dumb questions. She's not going to pay 4k anyways if her parents take care of her and it's their custom, they know what to do. The cost isn't going to add up and if it does, she said they can afford it. Just stop.", "No. You\u2019re being unnecessarily pedantic.", "No just really silly ones. But you have every right to continue. I always like a laugh about people not accepting the 50\u2019s are long gone.", "Nope that is not what oop said, she said shed like to lay in bed, do the bare minimum of feeding herself and baby, NOT SHOWERING which is totally great for healing her \"giant gash\" while husband picks up the pieces and takes a month off of work (which we all know in american culture can hurt your career)  you know women in the usa recover from pregnancy too.  I had my whole uterus cut out and was back to work within weeks, this whole thing is ridiculous.", "Staying at home to recuperate for 3 weeks after GIVING BIRTH is not being a stay at home parent, that's just common sense for everybody who doesn't live in corporate America.\n\nThis was the first time a reddit comment ever gave me chills, and I follow WhitePeopleTwitter. Y'all are not doing all right.", "Afaik, yes", "Can you put the link of the comment where those were answerd?  Thanks for your help.", "Are you saying her husband is dumb that he don't think that \"they can afford it\"? \n\nPeople say \"just stop\", when they know they have no logic behind their words, just arguing emotionally."]}
