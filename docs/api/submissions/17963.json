What we do is to stay in bed and try to recover the physical and mental toll pregnancy did on our body.\n\nSo I've moved to my husband's country and it's not a widely done thing here apparently and I've already take 2 months off from work. Ive talked to my husband about this but he thinks it's very unnecessary, especially since I need someone to take care of me and the child during the period.\n\nSo here's why I think is feasible\n1. We make really good money so it's not going to make a big dent on our financial account\n2. I can just have my parents take care of me\n3. My company has really good employee benefits so even if i take that extra month off it will still be under parental leave. \n4. My states have parental leave for guys too so my husband can also stay home to spend more time with our daughter and me.\n\nBut my husband was really against it and i do want to acknowledge it might be very troublesome to extend my parents visa.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if i bring up this topic again? His white American with Irish descent if that matters.\n\nEdit: I tried talking about it before but it was shut down and i thought it was fine and I could go without one. but my pregnancy wasn't smooth after 6th month mark and instead of natural birth we are now going c section and Alot of stuff happened especially within the last few week so now I'm pretty adamant about getting this one extra month of rest.\n\n\nto clarify when I say confinement i don't mean actually just staying on the bed of course I can move around and yoga is probably going to be in my routine. But confinement as in I avoid going out, i avoid doing strenuous activity and to rest more. And yes per my doctor's recommendations, she wants me to rest for at least a month.\n\n\nHi husband here. Would like to say this has open up my viewpoint. Was fed with a very skewed version of childbirth. We will be keeping discussions private from here.

'Lying in' absolutely *was* a thing in Western European culture, as well, but it went by the wayside sometime in the 60s or 70s.  It needs to come back.  Taking the time to rest and recover makes things so much easier, on everyone.\n\nEffectively, having everyone take care of me and the house made it much easier to focus on taking care of the baby and my health.  There was less stress all round, even for my husband.

You DEFINITELY have a right to want post pregnancy recovery and if you can swing it, good for you. I\u2019d personally continue trying to persuade my husband on this if I were in your shoes.\n\nIt seems like your husband may not understand the cultural practice, and that may be why he\u2019s being dismissive of it. More info is needed on that. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s being a straight up AH, though. He probably just needs some perspective on your situation.\n\nMy advice is threefold:\n\n1. The time you have with that newborn baby goes by in a blink, in large part bc you will be a newborn mother. It takes a LOT of figuring it out as you go and as your body is healing. You\u2019re going to be physically and mentally exhausted for a little while. So it\u2019ll be a blur. But you\u2019ll also probably always look back at the pictures of your tiny daughter and wish you could have just one more day with her while she was so small and snuggly and innocent. You almost certainly won\u2019t look back and think \u201cI should have gone back to work a couple of weeks sooner.\u201d\n\n2. When it comes to postpartum, expect the unexpected. I planned on being a working mom, but the second my first baby was born I knew I wasn\u2019t going back to work for a while. I also know mothers who had the opposite experience as me. I had one super easy newborn and super easy recovery, and I had a super challenging newborn and I\u2019m STILL recovering almost 9 months later. So you just never know. You and your husband will likely have unexpected shifts in your thoughts and feelings once the baby arrives. It can be hard, but it\u2019s normal.\n\n3. Because of the physical, mental, and emotional toll that comes with childbirth and raising a newborn, one of the best things you can do for your family is have a solid plan for your postpartum care. You won\u2019t want to be fighting about this with your husband. You\u2019ll both be very vulnerable at this time, but you especially. I\u2019ve seen resentment over postpartum care disagreements last for lifetimes. COMMUNICATE WITH HIM NOW. You may not have the capacity to do so when the baby arrives. Come to an agreement, and commit to sticking with it. It will be your safety net. Everyone in your family will need it. Once the baby is born maybe you\u2019ll decide you want to go back to work sooner than planned, or he will dread the thought of putting your daughter in daycare. Revise the plan then. But you should not go into the postpartum period with shaky plans in place.", "Cultures who practice this type of confinement have a lower rate of postpartum depression. The reason is pretty obvious. Women need time to recover their bodies and to be able to bond with their babies without added pressure of working", "NTA\n\nI think this tradition is something that should be recognised and practiced everywhere. I don't have my own physical experience of pregnancy and post partum, but I know how difficult and straining it is when you try to recover and take care of a newborn at the same time. And, after all... sorry OP's husband, but she was literally making a new person using her own body resources, and then will have to go through an exruciating pain of a childbirth, especially that labour can take many exhausting hours.\n\nI would understand if there were financial obsticles, but it doesn't look like it.\n\n>he thinks it's very unnecessary\n\nSorry OP, but I would get absolutely mad if I were you. Just do it - it is your traditiion derived from your culture, there is no reason not to. Especially that you thought of all needed arrangements.\n\nSo, why does your husband thinks 'it's very unnecessary' or is against it?...", "Please please, bring that habit overseas and advertise it. It\u2019s really needed. The USA needs to accept maternal care, healthcare, disability care and other terms of care bcs society is combusting in front of our eyes without it.", "NTA. You not being unreasonable here; continue to advocate for your recovery.", "NTA. You\u2019re giving birth, even if everything goes smoothly, you are bringing new life into the world. \n\nMy grandmother\u2019s generation stayed in bed for a solid 2 weeks after birthing her babies and then did extremely light activities while still on bed rest until the post birth bleeding stopped. Activities like knitting and mending clothes.\n\nMoms generation stayed in bed for a solid week and then light activity for 3 weeks - though hers was longer because she had a c-section with me. \n\nThe women in my family who have had babies in my generation keeps trying to jump right out of bed too soon and have a hard time keeping a routine and healing after the birth. \n\nResting helps allow you to heal faster and a chance to bond with the baby. \n\nWomen have between 30-50% more blood in their system while pregnant. That\u2019s between 1-2 litres of blood that has to go after the birth. Post birth bleeding usually takes 4-6 weeks, but can take longer. That is a lot of blood to be leaving your body. That\u2019s a lot of fluids to be loosing never mind the iron or the changes in hormones.", "I believe there are some scientific studies on the benefits of this that you could share with him.

You feel like you have been hit by a truck after giving birth, whether vaginal or c-section delivery. Everything hurts, your emotions are batshit and then let's not even talk about what happens to your boobs - it's a shit show and everyone tells you to rest and eat well... Who TF is going to care for your child and make you meals etc... ? For the average person, noone is around except maybe husband for a couple days then he is back at work, and let me tell you, it's rough. My husband was home with me for a week, and then his leave was up and it was back to the usual routine, except now I had a newborn to care for on top of laundry, cleaning, cooking etc.\n\nI'd take the confinement and care ANY DAY if it was an option for me, and it sounds wonderful to have that sort of support. Your husband will never understand the beating you take from giving birth, and I hope he gets with the programme and gives you the support you need.", "NTA, although I may be bias as this is my culture as well lol. From what I hear this is really important for mothers body to recover. Some women even hire a cook to cook postnatal confinement month meals aka ginger in everything. Perhaps google the benefits of it and share it with your husband, so he can better understand? Have to go with NTA but if he doesn't agree he might be TA. Congrats on the baby!", "NTA.\n\nYour expectation to take the best care of your mind/body/etc. and to follow the harmless, established norms of your cultural identity are perfectly acceptable. It won't be a financial hardship. You know that this is new to your husband, so you gave him options: \n\n1) Your parents can do all the work.\n\n2) You could hire professionals. \n\n3) Your husband and fewer professionals could split the work.\n\n4) Your husband could do all the work. \n\n\nOne thing I learned as an autistic kid (whose \"preferences\" are occasionally non-negotiable) is that, when trying to find a compromise between two people, you should always factor in how intensely each of you feels about the issue at hand. For example, trying to pick a restaurant. My vote is for Mexican, but not for any particular reason. On the other hand, my friend's favorite dish at her favorite restaurant just came back into season, and she's been waiting until payday to go eat there. Everything else being equal, we obviously go to her restaurant.\n\nYou will have spent 10 months growing a human inside of you, throwing all of your body systems into change and chaos. Then you'll have spent who knows how long pushing it out of you. This process can cause all kinds of physical damage in the best circumstances. Unlike Western/American culture, the culture you grew up in respected and honored this by allowing for your full, multifaceted recovery. This is very significant to you with regard to your physical and emotional health and your identity. Not only will the lack of this process be detrimental to you in several ways, but your husband's and in-laws' attitude about it combined with successfully denying you this process will damage your relationships with them and will leave deep scars of disrespect and denigration upon you.\n\nNow compare that with the husband's objections, which can be summed up as follows:\n\n- I can't do everything myself (accurate and reasonable) \n\n- I don't want people in my house\n\n- I don't like Chinese food\n\n- Having in-laws here will be uncomfortable \n\n- We don't do that here.\n\n\nNow compare the two perspectives. Who has a bigger stake in this? Who will be impacted more by the consequences of this decision? Etc.\n\n\nI didn't even get to the implications of this regarding trying to raise your children in a way that includes and celebrates both your and your husband's cultures.\n\nIf you fold now, about something of such enormous importance, you'll never stand up to future denigrating from your husband and in-laws.", "Your husband may also be concerned about being able to bond together as a family, just the 3 of you. With 2 extra people in the house for weeks on end, if it were me I\u2019d feel like it wasn\u2019t my house. I would want to be gone as much as possible. The cultural differences mean he\u2019d be working hard just to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s very challenging to step into a new role like being a dad with  MIL & FIL watching every move you make.

No one else\u2019s. Not to mention she capitalized the kitchen, making only their cultures good for mo this then acting offended if my brother made something different for himself. \n\nSo NTA, but I\u2019d pause to consider maybe it\u2019s not the extended time he hates, but rather having your parents there FOR MONTHS, leading him to not feel comfortable in his own home.

What we do is to stay in bed and try to recover the physical and mental toll pregnancy did on our body.\n\nSo I've moved to my husband's country and it's not a widely done thing here apparently and I've already take 2 months off from work. Ive talked to my husband about this but he thinks it's very unnecessary, especially since I need someone to take care of me and the child during the period.\n\nSo here's why I think is feasible\n1. We make really good money so it's not going to make a big dent on our financial account\n2. I can just have my parents take care of me\n3. My company has really good employee benefits so even if i take that extra month off it will still be under parental leave. \n4. My states have parental leave for guys too so my husband can also stay home to spend more time with our daughter and me.\n\nBut my husband was really against it and i do want to acknowledge it might be very troublesome to extend my parents visa.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if i bring up this topic again? His white American with Irish descent if that matters.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's common practice in parts of africa too  in my grandparents time it was not unusual even in eastern europe.\n\nEven among western countries, the USA is pretty unique in requiring new parents to go right back to work (so that even when the option to stay is there its seen as an uneccesary luxury). in europe the mom wouldnt stay in bed but she would definitely get time off from work guaranteed by law.\n\nthe problem is **pragmatic feasibility**. Normally this sort of thing involves the extended family pitching in to help  while the mom recovers (and hence, *not* dumping all the childcare & household chores on the new father) so if it's just him it might be very difficult.\n\nIf he can take time off from work but doesn't, I'd ask him why that is - is he afraid that his boss will penalize him (in that case he can't help it), or is it some cultural attitude or belief that he has?\n\nPaternity leave is NOT a luxury:  It is actually important for proper bonding that the non-birthing parent (usually the father, but also adopted moms) spend significant time holding the infant. at least 20 daily minutes of skin contact is recommended, smelling the baby can also help. This makes parental hormones & instincts kick in (yes, men have them too!) - Most dudes who take time off to be with their newborns are super glad they did it.\n\nIn the USA (and to a lesser extent all the west) there is this trope of fathers being bumbling, useless & not knowing what to do with babies and/or emotionally distant, and while *some* of it is sexism or laziness, the deck is stacked against these men because the society doesn't value giving them a chance to bond with their children. Staying home with the baby & caring for them while you recover is in his interest as well - again, *assuming* he can take the time off without risk to his job & your parents ensure he isn't overwhelmed with tasks. \n\nWe're not chinese but we've read of practices like this in other countries & if my sisters (or my brothers future gf) ever have a baby we're so making sure one of us (or mom, if she's still fit enough) can come stay with her to help so she can focus on recovering & bonding.", "NTA, please find a way to be confined.

Work those toes and feet. Rub the fore head and feed them their favorite foods. Make sure to get that bubble bath hot for her. And walk her there. And make sure to dry her. Get a very comfortable rocking chair for her to feed the baby. Have everything at her disposal. \n\nDo her laundry. Take baby and train on video games or watch star wars, lord of the rings. So the baby gets their movies in and try to catch up on what you know. Also baby pilates. Keep them in shape and make sure their armor is fitted for a baby.\n\nThen order your woman's favorite food again. Make sure she doesn't do any chores for awhile. And text her from the next room over on how hot and sexy she is. Or how going to get her water you miss her.", "This tradition is wonderful. Stay true to yourself and NTA.", "I'm conflicted.

If that blood stays in there, you'll get a fever and your kid will get the fever with you in the first two months (because if mommy has an infection, the baby will probably have to fight it as well). It's dangerous, for both of you.\n\nWe had both sets of parents in the house when my kid was born, but I have to warn you: They'll all have opinions about how to do things for your kid.

He sounds very controlling and that is kind of scary.\n\nThe husband is not the one growing a human and giving birth. His involvement in it pretty much stops before conception... he has no say in how you spend your time afterwards recovering. Plus, the complications do not stop even after giving birth. You need your time. Especially if it's a cultural thing *and* you'll have help *and* you can financially afford it. Stay safe!", "I'd say that capitalism put them both in a horrible situation. Just because you don't want to acknowledge the fact doesn't mean that people don't have to make sacrifices because so many bosses are sociopaths.", "But cultural does mean a shared group of practices or beliefs. It's not some American cultural thing because most Americans don't actually think that way. Corporate exploitation and Stockholm syndrome aren't culture.", "I gasped when I read the edit and was actually worried for OP.", "Fair, I don't know their whole circumstance so I can't really truly make a comment. Capitalism is really the root of it all, huh? Not saying that sarcastically btw, I totally agree.", "You mean, like every family has managed to get through since the beginning of time?\n\nThis is nothing new. If you agree with it or not is another question, but you cannot ignore the fact it is done because it is doable.\n\nRisking your job and family's financial structure is not a smart move. Because then you will have a wife with a newborn and a toddler and separated pelvis, with no house.", "Wow dude just took over the post. Worried about op, husband sounded sketchy from the get go and now hes not even letting her use the internet.", "Oh wow. Hubby SHUT. IT. DOWN.\n\nI was married to a guy like this, once.

I've never heard if paternity leave here", "Very", "Sounds like he's a real peach.", "From what I know it\u2019s a fairly common custom across the world. It\u2019s a period of time designed to let the mother heal from birth and spend the first few months with her baby. For the Chinese, there specifically traditional rules such as not washing your hair to not being able to eat cold foods because people are afraid that will have a negative impact on the mother\u2019s health. My mom told me how she had to argue with my grandparents about the washing hair rule.", ">The \"hi, husband here\" comment reminds me of working at the battered women's center. Why is he on her thread and shutting down future discussion?\n\nI'm relieved (not the right word, but close) that I'm not the only person with that impression.I get it, getting online feedback is hard when it's often critical and sometimes harsh. But this is a situation involving your partner and your kid. It's more important than saving your pride.", "Right?!? Very scary vibe there. But the fact that he\u2019s acting like her cultural customs ain\u2019t shit already gave an insight into husband\u2019s behavior.", "I hope husband\u2019s update at end of this post is genuine and not an indication of control.", "I had to look up the term \"heaty\" because I've never heard it before; thank you!", "And that he was \"fed\" it. Like you can't google a topic and learn more about it. I'm worried about her.", "OP, please hear me. Your husband had such a bad relationship with the same woman he is now putting above you in a multitude of ways and to such an extent that it is endangering your health. They expected you to do yard work after you left the ICU!!   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n If he was previously no contact and did not even care to tell them about the pregnancy (per your previous post) then WHY is he valuing her input over your current experiences (and doctor's advice for bed rest)?   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has nothing to do with cultural differences and everything to do with some very toxic (racist? misogynistic?) people, including your husband. After your husband's little edit, which was absolutely chilling, I hope you really take in what people are observing and communicating to you.", "What the actual fuck. Who make a person that is recently discharge from ICU do yard work. That some BS. My blood is boiling for you. OP please get your parents here to stay with you. I am talking as an Asian woman who just gave birth outside of her home country. \n\nYou absolutely don't want his parents there. I was at a very vulnerable state after giving birth, a lot of hormonal changes make you sensitive to everything. Beside, you will be bleeding for weeks even if you're doing c section. Plus, if you're breastfeeding, you will be topless most of the time. I told my husband that I 100% didn't need my inlaws there even though they insisted. The only people who were allowed to see me at that stage were my husband and my mom. My mom flew over and stayed with us for 5 months. There were some conflicts and disagreements because I hadn't lived with her for so long, and being close contact definitely created friction. We fought a lot, and I know my husband was uncomfortable at times. But my mom stayed cause she knew I needed her. Looking back, I wouldn't have healed if it wasn't for my mom. I got so much healing time, even quality time with my husband. My mom left 2 months ago, and I don't have time to do anything anymore. I got sick recently with no one to take care of. All of this is to say GET YOUR PARENTS HERE. Go extend their visa. Your husband can suck it up for 2 months if that what you're thinking. Gosh your abdomen is about to be sliced open and he wants to split chore evenly. Fuck that shit. You need to be coddled and served like a queen.", "That is definitely not normal! You bleed but it\u2019s more like a period. I had a c-section so I\u2019m not familiar with pain because I couldn\u2019t feel my lower abdomen (still can\u2019t and my kid is 2). However, if you have massive blood clots you need to get to a doctor!", "in latino culture, its also quite common for the mother to get help for the first month or two. usually their mother or their MIL is there to help. need to run to the store for more diapers? rash cream? either grandmother or grandfather is on the job. the mom focuses on being at home with the baby resting and recovering. heck, they even help with the household chores and cooking. \n\nits probably because they too understand the tolls childbirth takes on a body. my mom described it as feeling lethargic almost all the time. when the baby cries at 3 am, its usually the mom getting up, because the dad isnt gonna stick his nipple in the baby's mouth and feed it.", "I wish every woman could do this. I had a 3rd degree tear from vag to bhole and I could barely walk.", "They only told me to worry if it's larger than a golf ball.", "It\u2019s not common but it can also be normal.  Basically it CAN be cause for concern but once they rule things out they just shrug and say it\u2019s normal.  \n\nBleeding, cramping etc can be worse with each pregnancy too.", "Lol it does take some getting used to, but my partner adores the numbiness of mala! I'm sure you know, there's so many regional varieties to Chinese cuisine. Plus even home-based cooking which is more simpler isn't that out there palette wise. I'm sure your husband can deal with eating tomato-egg on rice. We even have meat and potato stir fries if he must stick to his Irish roots.\n\nOr just tell him to make himself frozen pizza everyday. Please take care of yourself!!", "The horror!", "China sounds like an amazing place for new mothers. Meanwhile in America I had to go back to work while I was still hemorrhaging and wearing adult diapers. If they have the financial means and time off to do so then it sounds like a wonderful thing.", "\ud83e\udd1d solidarity. It's such an American take on childbirth  and only the parents taking care of the newborn, when so many cultures around the world understand how stressful childbirth is both on the body and mind and have extended family or the community to help. In many cases, our extended family lives with us to help for situations like this. \n\nEven if she did sit around and eat grapes, I would be for it haha. She just gave birth of a whole new human!", "Is it better than 12 weeks UNPAID maternity leave? \n\nThat\u2019s what I got from my job in USA . My job is part of the federal government.   I got UNpaid FMLA", "The resilience of his mother's genitourinary reproductive organs 30 years ago is comically irrelevant to you today.\n\n\nImagine expecting his penis today to match the behavior or your father's penis 30 years ago in China.  \n\n\n\ud83d\ude33", "It is considered medical but you must remember that it is also natural. It is dangerous but a majority of births can be recovered from without having to stay in the hospital. Check-ups are important but often times doctors know shortly after the delivery has led to complications or if it becomes  outpatient care. Please understand in an ideal world we would have countless rooms for everyone to recover at their own pace. But most hospitals today are overcrowded as it is and after regaining their strength most women are sent home to finish recovering for their safety and to allow the hospital to free up beds for the next patients\n\nJust to point out, I'm not saying women shouldn't get rest. They should, and lots of it. But staying at a hospital to recover 100% is like staying in a hospital because you broke your arm. Chances are they'll patch you up and send you home where you can recover more comfortably and with less resources required", "On day 1, 2, 3. Sure. It can be normal. But after a month? Absolutely not! Cramping and passing clots after the very first few days points to retained products of conception, or infection.", "One of the advantages of the extended hospital stay in the past was that mom got to really recover. At home, men did not help at all. As soon as mom was home, the whole family expected her to take care of everything and everyone. Women had many more kids to care for and housework was very very labor intensive. Hospitals were set up for long admissions. I am a RN and agree that today\u2019s hospitals are not set up for this!", "Yeah, zuoyuezi can be really hard on women. I lived in China for years, and I was there when the one child policy ended. Several of my Chinese friends and colleagues who'd already had one child and could now have another if they wanted said they dreaded zuoyuezi way more than going through labor again. The food restrictions are very stringent too--lots of clear soups. No dark food (can make the baby's skin dark) or duck (can give the baby webbed feet).\n\nCustoms surrounding childbirth always made for an interesting conversation--I'm from the US, and to say my Chinese friends were horrified to hear the lack of support we give to women postpartum and that some women here are back to work within days of giving birth is an understatement. Part of the reason for zuoyuezi is to allow the woman time to heal (mentally, emotionally, and physically) and take the household pressures off of her--hence the parents and/or in-laws staying the month to help cook, clean, etc. This possibly helps with postpartum depression as well. From that perspective, I wish we had a similar tradition.", "Good tip, that might just work!", "Yikes. No wonders you guys have higher % of SAHM, I mean how is that feasible.", "That really sucks. In my country we always have 5 months for the person giving birth (at 80% normal pay), but more can be taken by either parents for a lower pay, it changes with contracts. Also there\u2019s time off for kid\u2019s sickness/other needs for several years after that.", "That\u2019s not true, I\u2019ve had 3 CS and I was told 2 weeks for all of them.

We\u2019re TTC later this year and the number of things I have to prep my husband for in terms of if X happens then Y and ABC are expected but DEF aren\u2019t etc etc is so long. \n\nLuckily we\u2019ll be close to our families and my mom and sister will be there to help him/us.
