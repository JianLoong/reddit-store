And starting last year\u2026.our daughter has been off. Whenever she\u2019s not modeling, she chooses to wear baggy, unflattering grey/dour clothes, and she has started wearing uglier glasses rather than nice, appealing ones. She\u2019s also become much more distant, and she LIES as often as she breathes nowadays. At first, my husband and I were concerned. But with how moody and dishonest our daughter has been getting, we have run out of patience and compassion, and we are disciplining her more and more these days. Right now, for the holiday season, she is under a strict curfew because she has stayed out late and come home drunk one night during the school break, and my husband and I choose what she does, where she does it and what she wears.

Your daughter isn\u2019t dressing inappropriately or too revealingly. She\u2019s wearing baggy \u2018unflattering\u2019 clothes and ugly glasses. So what? Why is that an issue at all?? \n\nDoes your daughter even want to model anymore? Because it sounds like she\u2019s dressing to not call attention to her or her body. Does she have to model revealing clothes? Have you asked her how she *feels* about modeling? Have you asked her if she enjoys it? If she wants to stop?", "Yep, YTA. Look forward to your daughter moving out at 18 and never coming back.\n\nYour child\u2019s mood, habits, and personal style have apparently radically changed. She\u2019s drinking. She\u2019s lying. This is cause for concern, but instead you\u2019re \u201cout of patience and compassion\u201d and treating her like your Barbie doll instead of your child, controlling her every move and dressing her up as you prefer.\n\nDid it occur to you that something bad might have happened? Maybe she\u2019s depressed. Maybe the modeling is impacting her body image and self esteem. Maybe someone on one of those modeling jobs was inappropriate with her. Or maybe she\u2019s just sick to death of playing fashion doll and us trying to figure out who she is. Whatever the reason, you apparently ran through your two seconds\u2019 worth of patience and decided to crack down instead of talking to her or considering therapy. She won\u2019t forget it.", "Let me get this straight. Your daughter is wearing loose and unflattering clothes, clothes which (if TikTok has taught me anything) are currently fashionable with The Youth. You suspect something is wrong, but you mostly care that she isn't dressing pretty. She's completely covered, just not dressed the way *you* want her to. She's a *teenager*, and it sounds like she's not trying to expose her \"assets\" to the entire world, and you hate it.\n\nThen, the mood change gets worse. She starts staying out late and drinking. Yes, she needs discipline. Grounding, therapy, all those \"good\" things. And what do you do? *You take away her right to self-expression and individuality*. You literally pick her clothes like some kind of doll or small child. That's not discipline. That's using discipline as an excuse to make her comply with the vision you have of how she should present. \n\nShe may be a model, but she is *not* your fashion accessory. Get her actual, constructive help. Find out if she's being taken advantage of, or, god forbid, abused by someone. Find out if this is just teenage rebellion or a cry for help.\n\nYTA.", "YTA for not getting her to a therapist STAT!!!  I am concerned about sexual abuse.", "YTA\n\n>At first, my husband and I were concerned.\n\nWhy exactly did you stop being concerned ? Her behavior didn't stop.

Something is clearly going on, just disciplining her isn't the answer. \n\nGet your head out of your butt, actually be good parents and get her to a therapist.", "I started dressing as ugly as I could and purposely got fat when I started high school. It was because I was sa\u2019d by my BIL with my sister helping him. I wanted to be as ugly and undesirable as possible so that them and others wouldn\u2019t want to touch me. I\u2019m not saying this is what happened to her but something happened.", "When I was 13, my mom took all my black clothing and burned it in a fire at her friends farm.

Have ya'll tried talking to her to see what's going on? Have you considered taking her to a therapist? Is it possible that she doesn't want to model anymore? Could something have happened to her (like being sexually harassed or assaulted) while she was modeling (or at any time) that makes her want to draw less attention to her body and appearance?", "Let here wear the baggy clothes, that\u2019s just an unreasonable issue. Substance abuse is one thing, but for christs sake let the girl live and wear comfy clothing when she\u2019s not modeling. Who cares if it\u2019s baggy, dingy and grey????? What a weird problem to have.", "Hard truth time, a**hole. I started wearing baggy, loose, \"ugly\" clothes after I got sexually assaulted as a teenager. I started breaking rules, lashing out, disobeying, and even drinking as a teenager because being good and following rules didn't protect me, so I might as well do what I wanted. \n\nSOMETHING. IS. WRONG. Instead of talking about how she's not \"dressing appealingly\" and punishing her all the time, maybe act like a parent and try to figure out what the hell is going on. And for gods sake, put her in therapy. You have her working in a high stress, over sexualized career as a literal child. **PUT HER IN THERAPY**", "You're punishing her for wearing unflattering clothes? You are a monster if this is remotely true.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I\u2019m not a big fan of what my 13 year old son chooses to wear. But I don\u2019t say anything because it\u2019s not really important, and it could make him feel judged or that he\u2019s not good enough or whatever. My bet is that she\u2019s putting walls up because you and your husband are controlling and critical. And now you\u2019re punishing her more for just reacting to how you guys are treating her. I hope she gets away from you guys soon or that you have a come to jesus moment with yourself. She\u2019s not going to be super respectful and happy and always wanting to be around you if you tell her you don\u2019t like her clothes. And that\u2019s probably just the tip of the iceberg. Congrats, hope you\u2019re willing to pay for therapy later on.", "Yeah, YTA for many reasons, but significantly for failing to recognize that your daughter is exhibiting classic behaviors of sexual abuse victims. Your daughter likely desperately needs therapy to deal with something that you are clearly not helping her with. And you are wondering if you are the asshole because your lovely little trophy piece isn't dressing the way you want? Seriously?!", "First of all, you can discipline your kid and still be compassionate, they're not mutually exclusive. This is called communication.\n\nIstead of establishing a punishment just to get them to correct a behavior, you actually try to understand why they are reaching out, while you explain your own concerns and boundaries. \n\nThe fact you are so worried about her appearance is beyond me. Are you sure it isnt because you enjoy parading your model daughter as a trophy? \n\nYTA. She has been exposed to a very adult-like world from a young age, but it doesnt seem she has the right support at home. Her looks has been a big part of her identity so far, and you are trying to control that like she is your property.", "So your daughter has:\n\n\\- lied\n\n\\- been moody\n\n\\- come home drunk one night\n\nand you institute this level of draconian control? My sister in Christ, why? I assume the modeling/baggy clothes/forcing her to wear \"appealing\" clothes is all related. Care less about your child's appearance and more about her wellbeing. YTA.", "Yes, yta. In so many ways. I\u2019m a teacher, but from what I see from my students outside of class is baggy clothing is trendy nowadays. What concerns me is the fact that you care more about your daughter\u2019s appearance than anything else. Because you don\u2019t like how she dresses, you\u2019re being controlling of her. She\u2019s doing typical teenaged shite. She\u2019s also lying because she\u2019s worried about getting in trouble, but that isn\u2019t working as well. \n\nHowever, more concerning is that you\u2019re letting her model. As a former model myself, Modeling is unethical for so many reasons. Like how your own value being your appearance and how well you as a person fit a certain mould cooked up by the likes of old white men in a boardroom.\n\nI can also say that there is a more than likely chance that your daughter is being sexually, emotionally, and mentally abused on set. The people that they hired for the kids aren\u2019t there to protect the kid, they\u2019re there to make sure that the kid does what they\u2019re paid to do. Look pretty. There\u2019s a chance that she\u2019s acting out because that\u2019s going on. \n\nYou seem like a vain person and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you pushed her into the Modeling industry to feed your own ego. There is so much more that I could say, but I don\u2019t want to open any old wounds. I\u2019m incredibly worried for your daughter. Your daughter might be a human doll when she\u2019s getting exploited on those sets, but she\u2019s not one off it. She\u2019s her own person, not a doll.", "I\u2019m with you when it comes to the lying and the getting drunk, but what\u2019s wrong with baggy clothes and grey colours?", "Y are both TA. YTA. Treat your daughter like a human person, not a potential meal ticket or a computer program you need to debug, or some kind of doll. She\u2019s screaming for help and you\u2019re going right to punishment? For *dressing how she wants to*? And if the drinking is new, don\u2019t you have any (human) interest in why it started?", "It doesn\u2019t occur to you to take her to a counselor/therapist?", "I hadn\u2019t even made it halfway through this before wondering what terrible thing has happened to your daughter. \n\nShe is hurting. Someone did something that caused this change, and instead of trying to get to the root of the problem you\u2019re punishing her for how she\u2019s coping. \n\nThe only concern you should have over her choice of clothing is why she is using it to hide - both physically and emotionally. \n\nShe needs therapy, both solo and then with you and your husband, ASAP. Yes, YTA if you don\u2019t get her actual help.\n\nETA: if your husband is the barrier to your daughter who clearly desperately needs therapy, then he is a barrier to you having a healthy child, much less a healthy relationship with her.

These final few years will be the lasting impression she has of you, and there's not much time left to make sure that impression is a good one.\n\nSo, INFO: Has it occurred to you yet that one day she'll be choosing your retirement home? Hope you like 'cheap and drafty with a hint of mould.'", "YTA.\n\nFirst, it sounds like your punishment has much to do with her appearance. This is shallow and petty on your part and very damaging to her.\n\nSecond, this kind of sudden behavioral change combined with her wearing clothes to desexualize herself suggests possible assault. You need to get her to a therapist asap-and learn some compassion.\n\nFinally, I hear only concern for yourself and not for your daughter. The lack of empathy is astounding. She deserves better than you.", "As a mom who's lived through this very recently, please look for professional help! This is shouting trauma and you're leaving her alone do deal with it.\n\nAlso consider this (outside the abuse scenario, if you rule it out 100%): these baggy clothes, dirty trainers, monochrome colours and big glasses are ALL they're wearing nowadays. Do you not show an interest in the culture surrounding your daughter? When I was their age it was fashionable to wear low cut jeans and show skin, parents hated it. Now it's baggy clothes, parents don't like it either? \n\nI feel for teenagers really, from one moment to another their existence alone is enough to annoy parents, parents start disliking, criticising and punishing their children for no longer being their barbie dolls and little tiny cutey puppets to play dress up with. \n\nSecondly, she got drunk once, okay not a good thing but educating rather than punishing so she knows how to enjoy parties and social outings safely should have been your priority surely? You can't keep her locked away forever. \n\nWhen you put a human in the world you should\nunderstand they do not have to be an extension of you, they're their own people, they're going through a lot physically and emotionally, you should have shown her more compassion op, but it's never too late, remember that cute little princess you had just a few years ago, she's still there, even smarter, funnier, with so many ideas and ideals, so much life and also so much anger sadness happiness frustration adrenaline and an insane rollercoaster inside of her that she will need help redirecting and no one better than the person that loves her more to do that. \n\nEvery time my daughter does something \"wrong\" the first thing I do is hug her and tell her no matter what mistake she made I still love her and she's still a beautiful human being in my eyes, we then discuss, talk pros and cons, move on to understand each other's side then problem solving, TOGETHER. I know it sounds incredibly difficult but you would be surprised at how brilliant teenagers are once you treat them like an actual human being. She still \"misbehaves\" sometimes? Yes. She's a person, not an angel, and thankfully so! ANGELS are meant to be in heaven not here growing with us. Your HUMAN child is growing-up, this should be taken as a privilege, not a terrible burden. \n\nYTA.", "It sounds like something happened - SA. Or, harassment.

She was coerced into doing hard drugs, became anorexic, was mentally, emotionally, and sexually abused and manipulated at the ripe age of 14-16. She bottled everything up and never let my father (her elder brother) or her parents about it until after a while but by then the trauma was already too intense. I suspect your daughter is going through something as a model. Maybe your daughter isn\u2019t going through something this intense but the modeling industry is known for taking advantage of its underage models - male and female. What I recommend is get off your high horses. She\u2019s not a source of income she\u2019s a living being and your child. She didn\u2019t start acting like this for no reason. I think you need to sit her down and say that there is no guilt involved and you guys are trying to look out for her, ask if she even WANTS to be a model. Ask her if any photographer, agent, etc has made her feel unsafe or harmed her in any way. Ask if she would be willing to give therapy a try. She\u2019s not a cash cow. YTA for not recognizing what are very common signs of anxiety, depression, and possible abuse. Also when you spend hours a day getting your hair yanked on and brushes shoved in your face and put into all sorts of outfits, she\u2019s probably just sick of it at this point and wants her time to be a person and not a dress up doll.

But I can\u2019t believe any parent would be this oblivious.", "YTA for the multiple reasons already stated in this thread. Discipline and compassion aren't mutually exclusive. Yes set *reasonable* boundaries for her, but your lack of compassion and empathy are truly concerning. As someone has said, she's displaying behaviours that could suggest she's been SA'd. She needs her home to be a safe space (and I get the feeling you're the type of person who would role their eyes at that phrase). You're proving to her that you aren't to be trusted, and part of a parents job is to be a trusted person for their kids. You've failed miserably at that.\n\nYou have likely already caused damage and she is unlikely to trust you and open up to you, so you need to get her help from elsewhere in the form of therapy.

Coming home drunk at her age is obviously a trigger to have more structures in place", "Well, those clothes are trendy with the younger generation now (it looks unkept and lazy, but hey, that's the current trend now), so there's not much that can be done with that. \n\nNow the lying stuff, I would watch closely and see how long it goes on. Some teenagers lean into it, and it becomes the norm and it stays with them. At her age, it would be hard to discipline that out of her since she's becoming more stuck in her ways. Sometimes it's just a phase teenagers go through. My sister was like that, but it generally stopped when she hit like 17 or 18.", "NTA.  If you don't setup boundaries and discipline, someone else(The Law/Govt) will.  She looks to be going down a treacherous path.  Keep in mind that love isn't always sunshines and lollipops.  Quite often it's discipline and painful!  Also keep in mind that this is your house!!!  Yall make the rules. Don't like the rules?  You won't get the safety, security,  nor provisions that you provide. Y'all are PARENTS, not friends.  If your kids like you that's cool.  Not necessarily though. But they will respect you.  Very necessary. \n\nOne thing I would do is praise her twice as much for the good that she does then for the bad.  Helps to motivate and reward good behavior.   \n\nI would also do away with idle hands while on punishment. Find another activity to focus her energy and thoughts away from the things that she can't do.  Volunteer at the homeless shelter, intern somewhere,  pickup trash. Use this opportunity as a way for her to reflect or at a very minimum understand that continued behavior like what she is portraying will land her in a situation similar to those in a homeless shelter. \n\nLastly your daughter is coming into her own.  It's time to have frank and open conversations with her.  Create a time and place that relieves anxiety and tell her how y'all feel and how you see her future.  Let her now that the safety and security that you provide now won't last forever.  Part of love is letting her fly free just for her to fall flat on her face.  This time instead of picking her up you will tell her to get herself up.  Parenting is hard and you will not have any guarantees. But you're doing the best that you can and that's good enough!

Ever since the age of 14, my daughter has been working part-time as a teen model for a local clothing brand (with my and my husband\u2019s (47m) permission, of course). And starting last year\u2026.our daughter has been off. Whenever she\u2019s not modeling, she chooses to wear baggy, unflattering grey/dour clothes, and she has started wearing uglier glasses rather than nice, appealing ones. She\u2019s also become much more distant, and she LIES as often as she breathes nowadays. At first, my husband and I were concerned. But with how moody and dishonest our daughter has been getting, we have run out of patience and compassion, and we are disciplining her more and more these days. Right now, for the holiday season, she is under a strict curfew because she has stayed out late and come home drunk one night during the school break, and my husband and I choose what she does, where she does it and what she wears. Are we the assholes?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. She is obviously going through something. She might be having some depression or mental health issues and instead of coming at her with a sense of concern and compassion, you instead punish her and are mean. Maybe look at it through a different lens. She is a kid and your child. Have her see a therapist or something. Maybe try talking to her.", "If her behavior is changing and something seems to be off with her please take her to a therapist, she is obviously not in a good mental state and being more strict with her will not help and just make her more distant towards you and more inclined to lie. YTA", "YTA that type of change in behavior seemingly out of nowhere is very concerning. YTA for not looking to it and trying to figure out what is going on and talking to her instead of just punishing her.", "Yeah you sound shitty", "YTA. You need to start working out what is bothering her. Your daughters behaviors are indicative of serious health issues such as depression or a myriad of others. Family doctors should be able to help you get started. You need to figure this out quickly though.", "YTA, instead of asking your child if they\u2019re okay you punish them. Instead of sitting down one on one and seeing what\u2019s up, to see why they\u2019re drinking or acting out you do this?\n\nYou\u2019re more concerned about how she looks than what\u2019s going on with. She could also have body issues from modeling, have bad influences, (such as you both) Actually sit down and talk to your child, you\u2019re the adults. I hope she has a trusted adult in her life since you both are not it.", "YTA", "YTA. Clearly a bigger problem here that needs addressing. Sit down and have a talk with her instead of making her life harder than it is.", "YTA- Even if no SA has occured. I have a friend from high school who had parents just like you (not saying my mom was a peach. My mom was just a control freak in different ways). My friend acted out. When I say acted out, I mean she treated her mom like shit and did stupid shit just to rebel. Her and her mom have a great relationship now (we're 36) but they only started mending their relationship after her little brother passed away. So it took death to bring them back together.\nEven though your daughter is a teenager, you can still make better decisions about how to parent. I will never understand how parents can be so focused on appearances.", "YTA. Your daughter needs compassion and support. She\u2019s asking for it, and you\u2019re complaining about unflattering glasses", "YTA. There are so many possible scenarios here and you haven\u2019t considered any of them. Suddenly wearing baggy clothes - she could have been abused or is a Billie Eilish fan. Lying - typical for 16 year olds but if a sudden behaviour change again, she could have been abused, bullied. Staying out late - again typical for a 16 year old. Came home drunk once? Was that before or after her change in behaviour? \n\nI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re punishing her for wearing baggy clothes. So many parents probably wish their 16 year old daughters would wear baggy clothes.", "Yta so, what are you really looking for? You didn't mention you think your daughter should go to therapy, but your husband doesn't, in your post, but as a comment...are you looking for ways to convince hubby? Or are you backpedalling? Super weird but I'm pretty sure you're looking at a future where you don't have any contact with your daughter. I pray she accesses therapy and is ok", "Info: what does the clothing and \u201cuglier glasses\u201d have to do with anything?", "This is a tricky one. The thing with teens is the harder you try to control the better they are at getting loose. And the more *sneakier* they are at getting loose. I have very controlling parents. They are not strict but controlling. There is a difference between the two and I can say you and your husband are being controlling and it needs to stop because it is not going to help her. Your daughter needs therapy and help now. She needs you and your husband to be an emotional support and her \u2018safe place\u2019 to turn to before she turns to the wrong things. You didn\u2019t know about the drinking which means she doesn\u2019t trust you enough for you to know. Also I feel like her dressing more baggy and rundown isn\u2019t a problem. I\u2019d want to talk to her personally about anything that\u2019s bothering her and really learn what\u2019s going on rather than straight up punishing. \n\nThey never said parenting was easy. In fact it\u2019s probably one of the most difficult job out there. Your daughter needs her mother and father to be there and you guys are just punishing her and it\u2019s causing her to rebel. She probably feels hurt and confused and sad. Please treat her better and get her the help she needs.", "Yes. Yes you are.", "YTA, in the extreme, and when your daughter flees your controlling grasp as soon as she's legal adult and cuts all contact with you and your husband, you will have only yourselves to blame. Give her room to breathe and live her life before she builds one for herself with no trace of you in it!", "YTA for caring that her clothing isn\u2019t attractive to you. Most parents want their kid covered up. Most parents would also be concerned emotionally for their kid with all these changes happening. Yeah you seem like TA.", "Lmao ya YTA in a few ways", "In my\nOpinion: YTA \n\nYou both seem pretty willfully ignorant.", "She's going through some obvious trauma and your reaction is to punish her for not acting like your perfect model doll. You see nothing concerning about a pubescent child hiding herself behind baggy clothes, withdrawing, and turning to alcohol to numb whatever pain she's feeling. No, it's about you! How dare she stop conforming to your expectations. Doesn't she know she isn't allowed to be imperfect?\n\nYes, YTA. So very very much. Get your kid into therapy NOW and then get over yourselves.", "YTA. My 1st thought while reading this is that something happened to her. Were you or another trusted adult  with her at all of her modelling shoots? If these are sudden and drastic changes I would be concerned about why and want to pursue that angle, rather than worrying quite so much about the punishments. Does she need consequences for her choices - yes, absolutely, but you also need to figure out why she is suddenly behaving this way.", "YTA.", "Sudden change to baggy, unflattering clothes? Sudden behavior changes? CLASSIC red flags for sexual abuse. But instead of being concerned and investigating what's going on, you're punishing her. Good job.", "YTA for choosing what your daughter wears but this is just a microcosm of a bigger issue. Punishing your daughter is not going to make her trust you more. It will just push her away and tell her that you are not people she can come to when she needs help. \n\nBasically, you're too controlling and this is not the way to fix your relationship.", "Have you checked to make sure she\u2019s not being abused in some way?  Such a pronounced change of character should be raising questions not punishments, at least as a first step.  Your daughter is hiding herself, she\u2019s downplaying her features, she\u2019s lying and nowhere have you said that you investigated these changes and got a reasonable response for the changes.  Nowhere have you said you got her a therapist so she could work through any issues she had, or a school counsellor, nowhere have you said you helped her.  So, after two whole years of escalating problematic behaviour with no help or resolution YTA, find out what happened to her, this seems to be something other than the usual teenage behaviour.", "Parenting is hard.

Get counseling.", "S#", "Yes. 100% YTA\nLet your kid wear what she wants and the stricter you\u2019ll be, the more she\u2019ll lie because she\u2019ll think that you don\u2019t value her opinion and input anyway.

Jesus, lady.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I was super into teen fashion (collected mags, interested in modeling, took lots of fun, expressive self-portraits). I have a very vivid memory of my mother telling me I was dressing like a schizophrenic (not even gonna begin to unpack that here). It was a very modest outfit and I had put quite a lot of effort into piecing it together.\n\nAs a direct result of this and similar comments regarding my physical appearance, I gave up dressing expressively for a long time. My mom was very controlling. I did not get away from my parents until I was in my mid 20s, and now, at 30, I have no fucking idea how to dress myself and border on panic attacks when I try to force myself to go update my wardrobe.\n\nYou're not concerned about your daughter. You're concerned other people are going to judge YOU because of how she looks.

YTA obviously. you have \u201clost compassion\u201d for your own daughter?? teen years are tough, she is obviously going through something that you and your husband are literally choosing to ignore. also, let your daughter wear what she wants\u2026 jeez.", "YTA about the clothing. Parents get concerned about teens revealing too much, but your the opposite. Let her wear what the zoomers like. Being picky on this reveals you for the weirdo you may be.\n\nShes underage and shouldn't be drinking. Look a lot of us did it but only the idiots would get plastered and busted by their parents.\n\nKeep in mind, the more strict and harsh you are, the more she actually might lash out. Instead of punishment you should go for positive reinforcement, yes tell her its not on but dont be a jail warden. Teach her about safe alcohol consumption instead of letting her figure it out alone and have incidents along the way.", "OP, you're out of your depth here and are going to make things much worse.\nThe clothing and appearance change is a red flag and a common expression of sexual assault.", "Hint: something happened during her modeling job, likely what we call in algospeak SA and she is having a traumatic reaction to it. \n\nYou're not helping.   \nYou're actively MISSING the obvious clues of her traumatic experience, and you're punishing her for it, instead of getting her help. \n\nYTA.", "I\u2019d be more looking into if anything inappropriate has happened to your daughter.

Do you listen and hold space and support her rather than tell her she is wrong and bad?

Because they know they won\u2019t be helped but blamed.", "It won't happen today or tomorrow, but at some point, your daughter will see a therapist on her own. And find out that her father is abusive, and you are also complicit in this. And you will gradually lose contact to the point where she will limit contact to quick emails about her life or no contact at all.\n\nMy father and mother are the same. I have some good memories that at 42yrs are gradually fading. Both felt that I talked back and was far too rebellious for their liking. So I was taught a lesson - corporal punishment isn't just what YOU see. It's what you don't - my mother knew something had happened but she never asked and laughed it off when I brought it up. It wasn't until I was in my mid 20's that I stopped flinching when someone raised their arm too quick or their hand near me.\n\nIt doesn't stop there. Statistically, that abused child then meets a future abusive partner.The red flags that everyone else knew to avoid, we see as normal. And then kids are brought into it...unless that once child decides to make a committed change to end the abuse with them...the cycle begins again. And so the wheel turns", "Wow what a failure of a mom.", "Your daughter is in an abusive household and doesn't feel like she can trust her parents because they're obssesed with sexualising her.", "I mean, dear god. Usually I just shake my head at these people but this one has me struggling to not say something that will get me banned. This poor child!!", "I have to agree. I come on this subreddit a lot and this mother needs a fucking trophy. I feel absolutely horrible for her child. Maybe the mom is suffering abuse from her husband as well. \n\nThat borderline corporal punishment comment made me want to barf. How sick. These types of people shouldn\u2019t breed.", "And mine", "Reading this is so horrifying to me for exactly the reasons you just laid out- she found success through her looks. Dad and his army buddy friend are controlling this girl\u2019s looks entirely right now. These two grown men are controlling this young woman and she is deeply emotionally hurt. \n\nYTA so many times over this isn\u2019t even funny. (And yes, up to [90% of victims know who they were assaulted](https://cmsac.org/facts-and-statistics/) by OP. Please open your eyes).", "Thank you for saying this. \n\nMy entire family is military. The idea that he would have to sign off on it did not make sense to me at all.", "Same! I am really having to control my language! She deserves to lose her parental rights."]}
