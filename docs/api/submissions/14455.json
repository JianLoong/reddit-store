He wanted to die at home, and despite having amazing hospice carers supporting us, it meant my family did a lot of the caring. My stepmum is honestly some kind of superhero for everything she did, and me and my brother (23) tried to help as much as we could. I missed school to sit in with him so my stepmum could go out of the house, and stayed at night so she could sleep. Me and my mum picked up prescriptions and delivered it to them. I cleaned the house so my stepmum had less to worry about and could focus on dad.\n\nWell my uncle (dads brother) hasn't really done anything. My dad has two brothers, and the eldest visited him every week despite living about 2 hours away, and nearing 70.\n\nHis other brother lives about a 15 minute walk away- if that. After dad became bedbound in early 2023 he stopped visiting due to \"shielding from covid\". It's important to mention he doesn't have (or live with anyone who has) a medical condition that would require him to be careful about getting covid. My dad didn't say anything about it, but the one time I pressed the issue slightly it became clear that my dad was sad that his brother wasn't seeing him.\n\nI'm not completely sure I believe the covid story, and my mum suggested that maybe he is just scared to see his brother in that condition- which is understandable. It definitely is upsetting to see. But I can't help but feel like no matter how he feels, my dad felt far worse. Even if seeing him in person was too much, couldn't he call him and speak to him? If the covid story was true, my dads bed was downstairs. he could have waved through the window occasionally. Even a text would have been good enough, but he didn't even do that. Just went no contact, for no reason (and despite being close before that).\n\nThe day after my dad died, my uncle has this long, self pitying message on facebook about \"how hard losing a younger brother is\" and \"how difficult the last few months have been\". The comments were full of loving and supporting messages wishing him well. I don't deny that losing a brother must be horrible, but the comment about the past few months made me so angry. Yeah, \"past few months\" when you couldn't send my dad or stepmum a text? the \"past few months\" when our lives got turned upside down while he sat at home twiddling his thumbs?\n\nI left a scathing comment saying pretty much that, and a particularly hurtful comment about how my dads last memory of him would have been how he let my dad down. I'm not proud of it, but I WANTED him to to be upset. I don't understand why he gets to be the poor mourning brother when his actions haven't shown any regard for our family. My auntie (his wife) has left my mum a voicemail which my mum won't tell me what she said. I know it was bad, and I regret the really bad comment. But why does he deserve my sympathy when its been up to everyone else to actually do the caring?", "created_utc": 1681131720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hi5ud/aita_for_publicly_humiliating_my_grieving_uncle/", "score": 5210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, the covid statement was probably a cop out for not wanting to see his brother dying. But it's clear that your FB comment is you lashing out in grief, and that's not fair either. He did lose a brother and it probably has been a hard few months regardless of how much effort you feel like he has put in. Should he have been more present? probably. But I also wonder if anyone actually talked to him about that while it was happening and asked him to be more present. I wonder if anyone actually told him that his brother was asking for him. Humans are flawed and complex creatures.\n\nI get why you said what you said, you lost your Dad and it's coming from a place of deep distress and grief. I empathize a lot for your situation - it's so hard, and when someone dies, all sorts of people come out of the woodwork and say all sorts of out of pocket things. But in this case, I fear you are (unintentionally) alienating your uncle and adding more drama to the pot.\n\nYou wanted him to hurt like you are hurting, but spreading pain doesn't bring about healing.

You uncle really suck for not visiting and getting in touch.  But... everyone have reasons. Some people can't be around death and emotions. Most likely, he was taught really young to \"man up\" and never cry/show emotions, and the situation with your dad was too hard so he just avoided it because he was never taught coping mechanism. Doesn't mean he doesn't care, for all we know, it could really have been one of the biggest challenge of his life. Sure, it sucks he didn't show up.

You are a child (technically) who lost their father, who sacrificed to help care for him while he was dying and who is not grieving. \n\nYour uncle is an adult who milked your pain and loss for social media points and sympathy. \n\nMy advice to you, as a parent in the internet, is let the adults deal with the fall out. Just don\u2019t engage in the topic any more. Avoid your aunt and uncle, let your mom and stepmom run interference and deal with the adults. \n\nUnless you used really offensive language don\u2019t apologize.

While I would never do what they did, and I don't understand it really, I can see (now that I'm not as blinded by my own grief and anger) that they loved him so much, and that he still knew it, even with what happened. Their pain from losing him wasn't lessened by having avoided the situation. What they did cost them time with him, and that's something they'll have to live with forever. I can't, in good conscience, call them assholes for what they did, just like I can't call your uncle one. You have every right to be outraged by it, but I think you'll eventually come to realize, like I did, that people deal with death in different ways, and when some people step up, like your stepmum, others turn into ostriches, and I think the burden of that guilt, on top of the loss they experienced, is enough of a punishment.", "NTA i would have done the same", "NTA.

I hope someone reached our to him before your father died and told your uncle that whatever form his grief came in, he was still welcome to come.

I've also lost family members to long-term illness, so I've seen it all. I get it, your uncle didn't step up for your dad AT ALL, and it would make me pissed as well. I don't really fault you for calling him out on the social media post. I don't know how active he is with social media. If he posts a lot, it may well have been his first reaction.\n\nWhat you do need to keep in mind is that everyone, and I mean everyone, grieves differently. It is not even remotely uncommon in the nursing community to have frequent issues where siblings and other family members simply don't have the mental fortitude to handle watching someone die. They do what your uncle did and just stay away...any excuse, they just go into complete denial about whats happening to the person that they love. Yes, I get that we all want to say that the person should \"push their own feelings aside\" for the sake of the dying person. But that's not how life works, and it's not how coping and grief work. Your uncle couldn't handle it, and it's very sad. However, it doesn't mean he didn't love your dad. It also doesn't mean that he doesn't regret his own failings as a brother. As sad as your father was, I'm pretty sure that he knew and understood his brothers weaknesses, and most likely forgave him for them. For your own mental health you should do the same. You weren't wrong for your response to his social media. And it's certainly okay to say I'm sorry my post hurt you. Your absence hurt my dad and I reacted to your post in a way I'm not super proud of.\n\nMany years ago when I was a new ICU nurse I took care of an older gentleman (80's) who had serious complications after his surgery. The Dr discussed his prognosis with his wife, who made the decision to put him on comfort care. She signed the papers, kissed him good-bye, told me to call her when he died, and left. I was floored...couldn't believe she was leaving her husband of over 60 years to die alone. I was angry and sad, and I made sure I was with him when he died. I called her to tell her, and she completely broke down. She was sobbing, said she just couldn't watch the man she'd loved for so many years die...and she knew how weak that made her. I spent some time comforting her, and I felt so awful for the unkind ways I had been thinking about her. Many years of experience with dying people have taught me that during the dying and grieving period, kindness and grace is important.", "How was the uncle putting on a show? How does anyone get to tell someone how they feel? OP isn't allowed to be telling others how they feel because they don't think they did enough or didn't show enough. My mom had a brutal death last year and one of her siblings could not come and see her. They wanted to remember her how she was. That is 1000% ok.

Your uncle is probably afraid of death and avoids unpleasant situations. He is a coward. But being a coward does NOT make it ok for someone to let a beloved one die alone. It does not make it ok to lie so ridiculously; couldn't he even come up with a believable excuse to spare his brother's feelings? And it definitely does not make them the person deserving pity. What it makes them is the ah. He could have done some of the things you and your mom did, like get prescriptions or whatever. He could have even been dropping them at your place, if he was afraid he would be forced to go in the house and see your father. He could have done ANYTHING. He did nothing.

You blew the smokescreen. And I asked you in another comment, he deleted your post, but did he delete his own self-pity tirade? Does he even feel bad at all? Or is saving face still his priority?\n\nI don't think you should apologise. You mention the worst thing you said was that he disappointed his brother. That is absolutely true, and quite milder than what he deserved. And there's no apologizing for this really, you would have to lie about your dad's feelings. Besides, if he is grieving once, you are grieving twice; you lost your father, and you are still a kid in many aspects. You are allowed the outburst more than he is allowed a pity post. Not to mention that you have less agency than him, a retired, fully grown adult with money and time, and yet you DID help, and he did not. \n\nI would be tempted to post on my own profile saying that I apologise for my outburst and making all of you kind people feel uncomfortable, but my dad died disappointed, and I couldn't stand this. But only tempted; I wouldn't weaponize my father's sorrow like this. Ignore this ah uncle of yours, and focus on your own and your family's grief.

Focus on that, not on what someone else may be thinking or feeling.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nI understand how difficult providing end of life care for someone you love. It\u2019s emotional and exhausting but you find a way to power through it. It\u2019s also nice to hear that your mother pitched in to give your stepmother some respite. \n\nThere are those that simply don\u2019t deal with end of life situations well. I had two brothers like that but neither went so far as to post online how difficult it was to witness. I can\u2019t blame you for your reaction.", "NTA\n\nI went through something similar when my dad passed away. I have two children, a job, and I was taking classes at the time, but I found a way to be by his side for hours every day. I helped care for him, including helping him eat, bathe, and dress. I read to him and held his hand. My three siblings couldn't find the time in their busy lives to even visit until my dad was very near the end. I helped my mother with arrangements and held her while she cried. My brother posted a long sappy story, and my sister posted pictures from the funeral .. that I arranged. It was so frustrating to see them practically beg for condolences when I spent so much time dealing with some of the most difficult moments in our family. \n\nI totally understand where you're coming from. \nIf I could go back and say my piece, I would.", "OK, so, you're 17 and your dad just died, and you deserve *so* much slack for that.  \n\n\nAt the same time, this is not in general a good way to handle conflict. You're upset at your uncle for disappearing from your dad's life and yours and not taking on any of the caretaking responsibilities. (I'm assuming he also didn't eg pay for getting food delivered some of the time, or a spa day for your stepmum, or any other hands-off but materially relevant form of support.) This is an extremely reasonable and normal thing to be upset about. It would have been reasonable for you to reach out to him while your dad was dying and ask what was going on, express that you were upset or that you missed him or that your dad did, and/or ask him to do specific things. (Or maybe asked someone else in the family to contact him; it can be *hard* having conflicts with relatives when you're a teenager or young adult, a lot of the time they just don't take you seriously, unfortunately.) It wouldn't be ideal but it would be reasonable-er for you to reach out to him (privately) *now* after your dad has passed away and clear the air about your frustrations. Picking a fight on social media, when you hadn't told him you were upset before, was a pretty bad way of handling things. Especially if normally you *like* your uncle and want to have a positive relationship with him going forwards.  \n\n\nIt is what it is. I'd suggest you apologize to him/try to make up. Possibly with some mediation from your mum or some other relative who can be impartial but sympathetic.  This is not incompatible with saying things like \"I am actually frustrated that you disappeared for the last few months and didn't so much as text.\" But, it's possible that won't go over well right now, so if it doesn't, give it some time/give him some space and be open to repairing the relationship at some time in the future. And if you can't bring yourself to apologize, ditto.  \n\n\nBut there is also a thing where *your dad* was also an adult and, assuming he didn't also have dementia or something, *your dad* was also fully capable of texting/calling your uncle and going dude where are you wtf. You are bringing yourself into *their* relationship in a way that isn't really appropriate. Your feelings are your business -- any loneliness or sense of rejection because your uncle wasn't around, any resentment that you made sacrifices for your dying dad and he didn't, those are *yours* and are your concern. Whether your dad was feeling lonely, rejected, etc -- that is your dad's business. (And also only something you can guess at, not a thing that you can know.) And at this point will have to remain unfinished business, although, presumably whatever happens with the dead he's not feeling lonely or sad any *more*. If your dad didn't have it out with his brother before he died, that's his problem. It isn't your problem, and if you want to have it out with your uncle I suggest you find a way to make it about *your* feelings, not about your fathers'. Your feelings are important and worthy of consideration too.  \n\n\nI may be calling for way more maturity or presence of mind than is realistic from you at this point. I don't know. I am fortunate enough to have not lost a parent yet, let alone losing one when I was still living at home not quite an adult. It is normal to have a lot of feelings to process after a loss like that, via journalling or talking to friends or long walks or therapy or whatever.  \n\n\nBTW, I'm *not* calling you the asshole and I don't think you are -- if your uncle was asking the same question I'd probably be a lot harder on him. But...he's not asking, he doesn't have a time machine, I don't think he's wrong for posting about losing his brother on facebook and that is *separate from* whether it was wrong for him to disappear for the last few months (and you have *no idea* what's going on with him, for all you know he's been flattened by the world's worst case of acute depression and hates himself far more than you do. And even if he was fine...a lot of itmes people don't *know* what to do about a dying relative. It's not ideal, and in theory he should have been able to ask someone/look around/figure something out, but...in practice, lack of clear idea of what to do + intense feelings = quite often freezing up, or other bad behavior.) In general, if someone's doing a thing you don't like, or not doing a thing you want them to do, and you don't talk to them about it at all until it's too late, they're not the only one making questionable decisions here.  \n\n\nFWIW your mum is probably right to not pass along the message, whatever it was. Go ahead and get out your uncle-related frustrations with your friends or, if you can, a therapist. Don't worry too much about your reputation in the family; again, you're 17 and you just lost your father, anyone who knows anything will be sympathetic about that. Don't be too harsh on yourself either. The reason I'm writing an essay and not just going \"eh, e-s-h, except for whatever your dad died of\", is that it's been really hard for *me* to figure out how to handle conflict and I'm hoping some \"here are some things you could have done instead and some things you can do now\" might make it a tiny bit easier for *you* to work this stuff out. Getting into fights with people you care about doesn't mean you should just put up with anything that happens; often it's a sign you should have stopped putting up with it and *said* something much sooner.", "NTA.  I have a relative who does something similar. He posts sad stories about other family members situations and then acts like he is actively involved. Generally, he has nothing to do with the actual situation but just wants the sympathy and attention.", "NTA, there's not much to it, you called your uncle out for being a hypocrite. That's all. I hope you and your family are doing okay. Best wishes <3", "NTA. When my mom was terminally ill we could not get her brother to come visit her. I finally called and left a message letting him have it and saying that his dying sister wants to see her brother one last time and if he couldn't get his ass over there he shouldn't bother coming to the funeral either. Never heard from him. Luckily he took my advice and didn't show at the funeral either. My grandma, his mom has disowned him for this too.\n\nLast time I saw him was about a year later at my great grandma's funeral. My boyfriend asked who the man was who kept glaring at me and I just said, \"Oh that's the uncle I told you about who wouldn't come see my mom when she was dying.\" I proceeded to pretend he didn't exist. My grandma said hi but not much else and I don't think she's spoken to him since and that was about 8 years ago.\n\nSo yea, I really hate people who try to garner sympathy that they don't deserve, especially scummy uncles.", "I have worked trauma, emergency, and medical helicopter for 40 years.  I have seen thousands of people die.  What I have noticed was the family member that \"carried \"  on. Ie. Showing their ass and crying excessively are the ones' that are the most guilty and have done nothing to be in that person's life.   Sort of like I am the main character. Making the event about them.  Sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  \n\n\nHe only posted that to gain sympathy, clearly. If he cared, he would have visited your dad. He had no excuses. Surely, he might be sad about it but to post how sorrowful he is online after basically ghosting your dad when he was sick is a heavily narcissistic and gross thing to do.", "NTA. If he didn't want to be called out about going NC with his dying brother in his last months, he shouldn't have done it. He bears the responsibility for that, even if you pointed it out in anger. You didn't say anything that wasn't true.", "NTA. I hate when people post that stuff on fb fishing for sympathy. Good for you.", "NTA. Fuck that guy and the Covid excuse is weak. Everyone who used Covid to get out of family obligations is pretty pathetic and deserves to be called out.", "NTA. I went through something similar. My grandpa, who raised me got cancer. I dropped everything and moved in with him to care for him. I was a single mum at the time and I literally did everything myself. His meds, hospital trips, feeding and so on. When he was moved to hospice I was there every single day. He has three kids. Two visited and helped when they came. But my egg donor didn\u2019t do shit until he was in hospice, unconscious never to wake up. She then sat there having the nuns (hospice was in a convent ) praise her for being such a wonderful daughter. It pissed me off so much. She only came up once he was about to pass to act like she gave a fuck. Then when he did pass she basically went through his house claiming everything for herself. So yea. NTA.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.  And I understand why you would feel angry about this abandonment by his brother.  \n\nWhen it comes to social media, it\u2019s best to take the high road and not comment.  His brother was clearly making excuses to avoid having to see his brother as he was dying.  Some people simply can\u2019t handle it or they want their memories to be of happier times.  Yes, it\u2019s selfish, but it doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t hurting deeply over the loss.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, I have an aunt who is just like this. Our entire family has been NC with her for a long time because she's a troublemaker. She will make posts online when someone dies even though she hasn't talked to them in forever. She did it when one of my sisters died and then when my other sister had a baby. She just likes all of the attention. Some people are like that. There's not much you can do about it. But good for you for standing up for your dad, though. His brothers absence had to have been tough for him, but it sounds like the rest of your family loved him, and sometimes that's enough. I am really sorry about your loss.", "Okay, this is tough. I\u2019m thinking NAH. \n\n\nIt is incredibly hard to loose a parent, at any age, but especially when you are so young. I lost my mom when I was 8 years old, and I can\u2019t relate exactly to how you feel, but I grew up having the memory of my mom being in and out of the hospital, drs coming through the house at all times (I now understand they were hospice nurses, no one tells the 8yo daughter that), and many more traumatic things I\u2019d rather not recall right now. I realized how hard loosing your parents are when my Nana died, and my dad who I have a strained relationship with told me he had a new found respect for me for going thru such pain at such a young age. All that to say, no you are absolutely not an asshole for being mad and reacting on it. I understand the feeling of wanting others to hurt bad, I mean, you(we) do it on the daily, they can\u2019t handle it for a day? But that mentality is so unhealthy and it won\u2019t help you in the long run. It won\u2019t make you feel better. It eventually gets old. \n\n\nThe reason why I say no assholes here, and I don\u2019t blame your uncle either is because EVERYONE  grieves so differently. When my Nana that I mentioned earlier was in hospice, I asked my dad when he planned on visiting her, and he said he wasn\u2019t and he strongly advised me against it also. His reasoning was that when his grandmother was towards the end of her life, he went to go see her, and always wished he hadn\u2019t because that\u2019s the memory he keeps of her. He wished he could recall more of the old good memories with her but the one he replays the most and that hurts him the most, is seeing her before she died when she wasn\u2019t herself. I saw my maternal grandmother a week before she passed away last year, and I finally understood somewhat of what he meant, but I don\u2019t regret seeing my grandma at all. I\u2019m like you, i saw her and all she could say was my name so I know it made her so happy and I would do it over 100 times again no matter how much it hurts me in the end because she means that much to me. I can understand 1000% why you are upset that your fathers brother doesn\u2019t feel the same way. \n\nBut, you will get older and you will learn more about your mom, step mom, dad, and uncle, and dots are going to start connecting, and you will be less mad. Maybe. Maybe the dots will all connect and you won\u2019t be so mad, but you still wont forgive and that\u2019s okay too. \n\nAll this to say: death is fucking hard. Grieving is fucking painful. Please be kind to yourself first, and then to the others around you who are also in pain.", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I lost my dad when I was 19, he was 49 years old. The pain and longing doesn't go away but neither do the memories of all the good times.", "NAH\n\nYou're both grieving. You can't control how someone else acts around death or dying. My Mom has been bedbound for 20 years, no one comes to see her except me, and I greatly resent them all for it, so I absolutely understand your anger. But your uncle being sad that your dad has passed is not unexpected", "NTA. Your uncle sounds like he wants attention without having to invest in actual grief. I know it's hard to watch someone you love die, but just abandoning them because you're afraid? No. Just no. Your actions, while not polite, were done from the depths of grief, a place where rage at the unfairness is easily triggered. The only reason I posted about my father's passing on both his Facebook and mine was because of friends and family across the globe. Many of whom I had no other way to contact. Beyond that, I never said a word on social media about his passing. My condolences to you.", "YTA everyone grieves differently and airing your shit on fb is always the AH move.", "NTA. People who do this deserve to be humiliated. If he wants to publicly play the grieving brother, then everybody deserves to know the truth before giving him undeserved sympathy.", "I lost my dad almost 2 weeks ago and still haven\u2019t posted anything to facebook. I will make one tomorrow as his funeral is at the end of the week and extended family should know but I really don\u2019t want to.\n\nI detest social media with a passion and only have it for reasons like this. I know others who post their whole life\u2019s online and assume it\u2019s just for attention. Definitely NTA from me.", ">only people who are empty inside feel the need to post everything to social media. \n\nInterestingly true (for me)... when my life was empty (widowed with a 2yr old), I posted a lot because I felt it was my only outlet. Now I am in a loving relationship (6+ years later) and I barely post anything apart from the occasional meme.", "do not apologize. you're absolutely NOT the AH. your uncle should be ashamed of himself for making it seem as if he were a loving, caring person but isn't. you had every right to call out his BS. don't feel bad about how you made him feel, he lied and tried to get sympathy for nothing.", "A few years ago my stepmother passed away.  One of my cousins had been her primary caregiver.  I lived too far away to do much more than provide financial resources.  When we knew the end was coming, I did not go see her.  She and I did not really get along (too much alike) and at that point, she did not know who I was.  I still feel guilty about that.  But, my cousin posted a lengthy tribute on FB.  I copied it and simply made an RIP statement.  Was I sad?  Yes, but it would have been massively hypocritical of me to say anything about losing her.  \n\nWhat your Uncle did was way out of line.  He could have been feeling his own massive guilt similar to mine and this was his way of voicing that.  Or he could just be an AH trying for empathy from others.  \n\nGive this a lot of time before deciding anything.  You are grieving and need time to process everything.  He may figure out he is the AH on his own.", "My mom went through hospice at home, and I was her caretaker. It was really hard. She had several sisters as well as her mother who were all alive and well while this was happening- not one of them made the effort to visit her (they lived out of state and mom was not close with them), and they would call her once a year, maybe twice, max. The day my mom died, we contacted all her close friends so they could drive over and say goodbye. We were doing the best we could with an impossible situation, and it honestly didn\u2019t occur to us to call her family. Oh, they freaked out about it. Threw out all sorts of nasty insinuations and accusations.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is what I think- that people who have lost a parent or a spouse are just trying to get by.

You don't lie in public and expect not to get called out. He brought that upon himself.", "I don't know if you should apologize because I don't know your uncle. What I can say is that people have different emotions/reactions when facing the dead of their loved ones. I imagined myself being in your situation and I probably would have been really pissed. You being angry is legit. Then I imagined being in your uncle situation and to be honest, I don't know if I could sit next to my little sister and watch her die. I hope I never have to find out what kind person I'll be in this situation.", "Honey you have nothing to apologize for.", "This is exactly it", "Amen. Very well said. Not everyone is equipped to handle death.", "Fair enough.  Just my own experience here, and I\u2019m not trying to be confrontational, but: I\u2019m an extremely private person, have very little social media presence, pretty wildly introverted in general.  But when my dad died?  I don\u2019t know how to describe it except that I was filled with fucking howling grief.  I wrote (and still occasionally write, three years after his death) extremely personal tributes to him and posted them online.  My dad was a pretty quiet person too, and not many people knew him, and I guess I wanted people to know him.  To know how incredible he was, and how loved he was, and to know that he\u2019s dead.  I wanted everyone in the goddamn world to know that my dad was incredible, and loved, and dead.  \nAnd there\u2019s probably a gross part of me that wanted everyone to know how much I was hurting, although I hope that\u2019s a pretty small part.  It did feel like I was walking around with a sucking wound where my torso had been, and it felt bizarre that people couldn\u2019t tell just by looking at me.  Those first few weeks I found myself telling cashiers and waitresses that I\u2019d just lost my dad.  I feel pretty bad about that.  \nSo I guess\u2026grief does weird shit to us.

But I learned something in a management class once.  While it had to do with business strategy, I have modified it to apply to all things.  The instructor called it the emotional bank account.  (I suppose they are not the only one to share this idea). This account starts with a fixed value and you cannot deposit to it.  You can only withdraw.  It takes careful thought to decide what emotions are worthy of withdrawal.\n\n  In a case like yours, I have learned that negative emotions like that are not worth it.  It's better to keep them in the account and save them for other emotions that can have a more positive effect.  \n\nI will give you a trivial example. I used to get upset with bad drivers.  Give them the \"Philadelphia Wave\", mouth obscene phrases to them, etc...  What I found was that days later, I would still be thinking about this event.  This meaningless event. Why was it still in my head? It was because I let that withdrawal happen.  That emotional bank account withdrawal came with compound interest, because it continued to fester in my head.  \n\nI'm certainly not perfect, but now that I choose to let a lot of the trivial stuff go and move on from it, I find that those negative events are out of my head much more quickly than before.  \n\nI've lost a sister and a brother in the past few years.

The day of my mom's death my sister and I were worried about her, and both texted our aunt trying to get our mom's landlord's information so we could have him go back to check on mom since the police said they'd go for a check but then weren't getting back to us. Aunt (who lived down the street) couldn't have cared less.\n\nWelp, mom died. In a really horrific way. My petty ass sister and I didn't tell her right away (we were dealing with a lot) and had to scramble to fly from states away to deal with mom's affairs. One of which was clearing her rental of all her belongings. One of the things we'd found was an unopened gift aunt had gotten for my mom before grandma died.\n\nWe drove to (grandma's) her house, sis dropped the gift off on the stoop, and only after leaving the neighborhood did we text to say mom died.

It sounds like the relationship is a lot more complicated and has more dynamics involved than a \u201ctypical\u201d sibling relationship. For your part, I don\u2019t think you were an AH, I think you were experiencing valid emotions, they were just expressed in a way you have said you regret. To say your uncle was an AH, I would have to know what he was thinking and why he didn\u2019t go or call or anything. At the end of the day though, you get to live with the knowledge of everything you did to make your dad as comfortable as possible. Your uncle gets to live with the fact that the last interaction he had with his brother prior was several years before that happened and that him not being there at the end caused a lot of negative emotions. That may have been what he wished for. \n\nWhen someone goes into hospice care they start grieving someone who is still living. Some individuals cannot bear that; they feel if they don\u2019t show up then it\u2019s not real, it\u2019s not actually happening. It can be seen as selfish because the person still needs you, but grief is an incredibly complex thing and any judgment you have of your uncle is probably not even close to the judgment he has for himself. That doesn\u2019t negate that he lost a baby brother. He posted publicly that he\u2019s hurting and that should be taken at face value just as your actions should be taken at face value for a grieving daughter. You aren\u2019t an AH, you aren\u2019t a bad person, you\u2019re hurting and lashed out in a way you normally wouldn\u2019t. He acted in ways it sounds like he normally wouldn\u2019t (given the surprise he didn\u2019t show up. If it were my family and this happened the surprise would come that they actually showed up so it appears he normally has been there). \n\nI know you have mentioned apologizing. I feel like if you want to apologize, it would be for the tone and public arena, but not the context. It\u2019s ok to let him know that while you wish it didn\u2019t happen how it did, you are also hurt by him not being there and leave it at that. If he wants to explain he can, if he doesn\u2019t he doesn\u2019t have to. \n\n\nINFO: Since your mom has shielded you from the details on the drama, is it possible he didn\u2019t feel like he could call/text or visit?

I had spent the 6 months before looking after her and her surviving twin at a faraway hospital, completely alone at 19. \n\nMy grandma coded and went into a coma the same time she died and was transported to a different faraway hospital. While I was grieving, settling back in at my grandparents home (they'd raised me from age 13), figuring out funeral arrangements, and taking care of a very special needs infant, my family were losing their minds. \n\nI didn't realize until then that my grandma was responsible for making sure everyone behaved. She was a strong and respected matriarch with a strong and respected patriarch by her side. Everyone thought she was going to die and it was like a struggle for dominance among my dad's generation.\n\nI got dragged in for reasons I still don't understand fully, I just wanted to be left alone, my dad and uncle tried to take over my daughter's funeral to have some fancy service, which I declined as I'd already roughly planned it months before, the women in the family spread rumors that I was having outbursts that I couldn't remember because I was on drugs (I have never taken drugs I wasn't supposed to because drug addiction runs in my family and I have witnesses of the \"events\" that assured me that I didn't behave the way they said). \n\nAn example is that I asked my stepmom to watch my daughter overnight the night before my late daughter's visitation because I hadn't slept in days and was going to take one of the Xanax that *my obgyn had prescribed to me*, and it was the only one I'd taken in my life. The bottle was stolen some time that week by one of the family addicts I assume, but I no longer needed it so I didn't care. The rumor was spread that was taking pills and getting high while caring for my daughter. The rumor was spread by 2 homeless relatives in my father's generation that wanted my bedroom at my grandparents home. \n\nMy father refused to speak to me at my late daughter's visitation, he attended and stood in a corner, staring straight ahead and ignoring me as punishment for not letting my uncle have a 2 hour sermon and for allowing people to hold her body (she was critically ill and unable to be held the majority of her life, I just wanted my baby to have a chance to be a baby for once in her existence). \n\nThere's so much more that happened, but the jist is that they made my grief so much harder than it needed to be. I was traumatized by not only losing my baby, but realizing that my family isn't what I thought they were. Truly, it was all very out of character. \n\nMy grandparents just died, both of them. I have been nothing but kind and considerate to all of the people that bullied me when I was at my most vulnerable.

He is definitely an asshole for the way he wasn't present during that time, but counting the small things he could have done instead doesn't mean you completely understand his situation or reasoning for not visiting.\n\nYour uncle definitely pulled a wrong move trying to garner pity on social media, and triggered you to post that comment, but in the end when the time came and everyone was grieving, you put a wedge in your family when they needed to come together the most, and maybe that is why you regret the comment.  \n\nDid you hold resentment towards him specifically because of his closer proximity to your family than others?

Publicly flaming him is an asshole move.\n\nReality is he probably hated seeing your dad like that, and might have been partially protecting him from COVID-19 by not coming, and partially using it as an excuse to pretend everything was fine 15 minutes away. He probably didn't really realize how little time he had. Now he is sad, and it might be partly because he wasn't around much. Not exactly the best.\n\nPublicly mourning on Facebook is weird to me, BUT it does mean people around him will know that he isn't 100% so he can get cut some slack by friends/coworkers. By putting him on blast, you really damaged him a bit more then he might have really deserved at a time when he was already not feeling the best.\n\nBest move would have been to privately vent to your mom, and then maybe send him a private message on Facebook after she maybe talked you down from some of the harsher criticism. \n\nAbraham Lincoln was famous for not sending angry letters he wrote. \n\nYou're young and right to be upset, but lashing out Publicly like this is r/pettyrevenge material, which usually means you're a bit of an asshole.

Sorry for your loss.", "YTA.   \n\n\nI get that it's a tough time and you wanted more. But we all react to grief differently. Your uncle may not have seemed like he was doing it tough, but the clues were there. He had been visiting apparently, but then when your dad was bed bound he stopped. I don't think you're really too badly in the wrong for feeling that way, but making a comment like that was too far.  \n\n\nI remember when my dad's uncle was dying, we had a gathering. His surviving brother and sister turned up as well as nephews, his kids and grandkids and a few others. It was quite a few of us. It had been intended to be at a pub, but he quickly went downhill and it was in the hospice. I'd always expected it would be a good idea to have a farewell like this before someone died. But I was terribly wrong because it was awful. He was struggling to know who was there and at one point his brother wanted a hug, then a handshake and finally just begged \"just a touch brother\". But he was so out of it he simply didn't recognise his own brother. We took a photo and whilst it seemed good, it's one I never want anyone to see. Nobody could smile and the sheer horror of grief on the faces of those in the same generation, his siblings and their lifelong partners betrayed their feelings. This was not long after my own grandfather (another brother) had died. My grandmother looked after him in their home as he faded away. And whilst she did that dutifully and treasured those last days, seeing her brother in law like that was much, much worse somehow. She even commented as we left that it was something she never wanted to do again.  \n\n\nI think the toll of watching a sibling fade away is one that is unique. I think your uncle likely struggled more than you realise and despite being absent, I doubt he was rarely thinking of your dad in that time. Especially if he was kept in the loop. I imagine he'll understand your sentiment and perhaps he struggled with that guilt himself. So whilst I say YTA for your response, I think mostly it's just a family struggling with grief.", "NAH. I'd normally say E-S-H, but you're a kid and everyone is struggling. Mental illness, depression, grief, and stress can take the wind out of your sails. You may not be able to make yourself respond until it's too late under circumstances like those. He should have been there, but... he's also grieving and you shouldn't just do a public teardown of someone who lost their brother. You are all grieving in your individual ways. You have the worst of the lot, being a minor with your father passing, but I doubt your uncle was home twiddling his thumbs. Don't blame yourself or him or anyone. Just let yourself and everyone else grieve, and don't make your father's legacy about your uncle. Your father deserves better.", "First off, im sorry for your loss and I'm sorry if my response seems harsh. I'm not trying to be extra mean considering your situation, but you asked, we answered. \n\nI'm leaning towards ESH. \n\n1. Your uncle should have made an effort. The covid excuse is weak. Maybe there's more to the story than meets the eye. Maybe he was worried thst his own shit / germs / whatever would make your dad sicker. Maybe he's just weak and doesn't have the guts to look at your father, or talk to him, even through a window. Death fucks people up. They act weird and it manifests itself differently. Maybe he revered your father and just couldn't face up to seeing him because he knew it would destroy him. Maybe he was such a mess about your fathers death that he became a drug addled recluse. The long and short of it is that you don't know his business and you don't get to choose how hurt and how much suffering he's going through. You're young, so I chalk it up to immaturity. But please, going forward, don't assume you know what other people are going through. \n\n\n2. Its so fucking improper to shit on a grieving person in public. Its pathetic. Its debase. Its awful. Its inhuman. As I said before, you don't know what his situation is, so don't shit on him for something you don't know and you don't understand. You're hurt, fine, but thats on you. Everyone grieves differently, and maybe his Facebook post is how he deals with it. Its not your call, its not your position to put it down. You can be upset with him all you want, but do it in private. Shitting on him on Facebook tells people more about you as a person than it does about him. Get over yourself.
