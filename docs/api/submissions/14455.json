He wanted to die at home, and despite having amazing hospice carers supporting us, it meant my family did a lot of the caring. My stepmum is honestly some kind of superhero for everything she did, and me and my brother (23) tried to help as much as we could. I missed school to sit in with him so my stepmum could go out of the house, and stayed at night so she could sleep. Me and my mum picked up prescriptions and delivered it to them. I cleaned the house so my stepmum had less to worry about and could focus on dad.\n\nWell my uncle (dads brother) hasn't really done anything. My dad has two brothers, and the eldest visited him every week despite living about 2 hours away, and nearing 70.\n\nHis other brother lives about a 15 minute walk away- if that. After dad became bedbound in early 2023 he stopped visiting due to \"shielding from covid\". It's important to mention he doesn't have (or live with anyone who has) a medical condition that would require him to be careful about getting covid. My dad didn't say anything about it, but the one time I pressed the issue slightly it became clear that my dad was sad that his brother wasn't seeing him.\n\nI'm not completely sure I believe the covid story, and my mum suggested that maybe he is just scared to see his brother in that condition- which is understandable. It definitely is upsetting to see. But I can't help but feel like no matter how he feels, my dad felt far worse. Even if seeing him in person was too much, couldn't he call him and speak to him? If the covid story was true, my dads bed was downstairs. he could have waved through the window occasionally. Even a text would have been good enough, but he didn't even do that. Just went no contact, for no reason (and despite being close before that).\n\nThe day after my dad died, my uncle has this long, self pitying message on facebook about \"how hard losing a younger brother is\" and \"how difficult the last few months have been\". The comments were full of loving and supporting messages wishing him well. I don't deny that losing a brother must be horrible, but the comment about the past few months made me so angry. Yeah, \"past few months\" when you couldn't send my dad or stepmum a text? the \"past few months\" when our lives got turned upside down while he sat at home twiddling his thumbs?\n\nI left a scathing comment saying pretty much that, and a particularly hurtful comment about how my dads last memory of him would have been how he let my dad down. I'm not proud of it, but I WANTED him to to be upset. I don't understand why he gets to be the poor mourning brother when his actions haven't shown any regard for our family. My auntie (his wife) has left my mum a voicemail which my mum won't tell me what she said. I know it was bad, and I regret the really bad comment. But why does he deserve my sympathy when its been up to everyone else to actually do the caring?", "created_utc": 1681131720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hi5ud/aita_for_publicly_humiliating_my_grieving_uncle/", "score": 1361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep on. \nNote: I recently lost my father 3 months ago to cancer, and like you. I watched as certain family members bragged about how involved they were, but yet listened to how hurt my father was at their lack of contact and support in the time he was sick.

Yes, the covid statement was probably a cop out for not wanting to see his brother dying. But it's clear that your FB comment is you lashing out in grief, and that's not fair either. He did lose a brother and it probably has been a hard few months regardless of how much effort you feel like he has put in. Should he have been more present? probably. But I also wonder if anyone actually talked to him about that while it was happening and asked him to be more present. I wonder if anyone actually told him that his brother was asking for him.

I empathize a lot for your situation - it's so hard, and when someone dies, all sorts of people come out of the woodwork and say all sorts of out of pocket things. But in this case, I fear you are (unintentionally) alienating your uncle and adding more drama to the pot.\n\nYou wanted him to hurt like you are hurting, but spreading pain doesn't bring about healing. I hope you are able to move forward from this. I'm very sorry for your loss.", "ESH. His actions are pretty shitty, he had lots of opportunities to see his brother before the end and squandered them. But you're also grieving and, I suspect, lashed out more from a place of pain than any desire to mend or heal. He fucked up and now he's paying the price, and while you're right, your timing was poor.

You uncle really suck for not visiting and getting in touch.  But... everyone have reasons. Some people can't be around death and emotions. Most likely, he was taught really young to \"man up\" and never cry/show emotions, and the situation with your dad was too hard so he just avoided it because he was never taught coping mechanism. Doesn't mean he doesn't care, for all we know, it could really have been one of the biggest challenge of his life. Sure, it sucks he didn't show up.

My dad passed last year and while his family did not help (they lived in a different country and also had considerable health issues) they did take the time for zoom calls, prayer group, plus a few did come to visit him when is was very ill and it made a huge difference. \n\nYour uncle could have done more and should have tried at the very least.

First, I\u2019m so sorry about your dad. And I feel for your whole family. \n\nI went through this with my dad: I had siblings who admitted they weren\u2019t up to it, and that was hard to see. They couldn\u2019t bring themselves to visit, never mind help.\n\nThe difference was that they didn\u2019t go on to pretend, especially on social media, that it was something else. I respected them for that. \n\nI also considered the totality of their relationship with our dad; while they weren\u2019t there at the end, they were there many other times during their lives, bringing our dad great joy.\n\nI still was sad on behalf of my dad but I wasn\u2019t enraged. \n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that is enraged on your dad\u2019s behalf, especially because your uncle is a generation older and should have known better. \n\nI saw that you were going to apologize.

Perhaps it may have been better if she\u2019d sent her message privately to him rather than comment so all can see, that\u2019s why the aunt rang mum because they\u2019re embarrassed they\u2019ve been publicly called out. \n100% the OP is NTA", "NTA. My uncles were sort of the same way when my grandma was dying. It was much faster (a few days in a hospital rather than months at home) but my mom and I took turns being with her 24/7 and my uncles could not bring themselves to visit more than once. Social media was not a thing at the time, but if either of them had made a post similar to your uncle\u2019s, I\u2019d have let them have it. There\u2019s also a bit of N A H because everyone processes grief differently, and I can have some empathy for being unable to face a family member dying. If he hadn\u2019t made that post, his behavior would have been selfish but understandable. To put on a public face of actions he did not actually do privately, though\u2026 that\u2019s infuriating.", "NTA. You have a remarkable amount of self-awareness and consideration for others for someone who is only 17. There are adults 3X your age who aren\u2019t that sophisticated. If the worst way you lashed out was one maybe regrettable social media post, you really are a champ. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the best thing to do, but it\u2019s also not worth agonizing over, in my opinion. It may have been harsh but it also sounds true. And it\u2019s okay to cut yourself some slack and have compassion for yourself too, your dad just passed away. Hang in there!", "YTA. You don't get to decide how someone else processes things and grieves. You are not in his mind and you have no idea how he feels or why he reacted the way he did.

Grandma died unexpectantly in june of that year, the uncle who lived out of state (my youngest uncle) died in november that year, grandpa died in march the following. When it came time to go through what the grandparents owned, my aunts and uncles were of course all there, and they made comments about how they wished their kids could have been able to spend time with them like my brother and I did.

It isn\u2019t a judgement of who they are as a person, just a reality. During this time, you need to find grace for yourself and grace for the people you want to continue having a relationship with in the future.
