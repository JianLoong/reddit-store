He wanted to die at home, and despite having amazing hospice carers supporting us, it meant my family did a lot of the caring. My stepmum is honestly some kind of superhero for everything she did, and me and my brother (23) tried to help as much as we could. I missed school to sit in with him so my stepmum could go out of the house, and stayed at night so she could sleep. Me and my mum picked up prescriptions and delivered it to them. I cleaned the house so my stepmum had less to worry about and could focus on dad.\n\nWell my uncle (dads brother) hasn't really done anything. My dad has two brothers, and the eldest visited him every week despite living about 2 hours away, and nearing 70.\n\nHis other brother lives about a 15 minute walk away- if that. After dad became bedbound in early 2023 he stopped visiting due to \"shielding from covid\". It's important to mention he doesn't have (or live with anyone who has) a medical condition that would require him to be careful about getting covid. My dad didn't say anything about it, but the one time I pressed the issue slightly it became clear that my dad was sad that his brother wasn't seeing him.\n\nI'm not completely sure I believe the covid story, and my mum suggested that maybe he is just scared to see his brother in that condition- which is understandable. It definitely is upsetting to see. But I can't help but feel like no matter how he feels, my dad felt far worse. Even if seeing him in person was too much, couldn't he call him and speak to him? If the covid story was true, my dads bed was downstairs. he could have waved through the window occasionally. Even a text would have been good enough, but he didn't even do that. Just went no contact, for no reason (and despite being close before that).\n\nThe day after my dad died, my uncle has this long, self pitying message on facebook about \"how hard losing a younger brother is\" and \"how difficult the last few months have been\". The comments were full of loving and supporting messages wishing him well. I don't deny that losing a brother must be horrible, but the comment about the past few months made me so angry. Yeah, \"past few months\" when you couldn't send my dad or stepmum a text? the \"past few months\" when our lives got turned upside down while he sat at home twiddling his thumbs?\n\nI left a scathing comment saying pretty much that, and a particularly hurtful comment about how my dads last memory of him would have been how he let my dad down. I'm not proud of it, but I WANTED him to to be upset. I don't understand why he gets to be the poor mourning brother when his actions haven't shown any regard for our family. My auntie (his wife) has left my mum a voicemail which my mum won't tell me what she said. I know it was bad, and I regret the really bad comment. But why does he deserve my sympathy when its been up to everyone else to actually do the caring?", "created_utc": 1681131720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hi5ud/aita_for_publicly_humiliating_my_grieving_uncle/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has been LC with us since then. Recently my father who is 87 fell sick. Last week there was a day when we feared the worst.\n\nI called his sister to let her know, in case she wanted to talk to him. She was here with her son the next morning. She lives in the other end of the country. She made a 9 hr journey to see him. \n\nIt was so heartwarming to see the two of them makeup for all past grievances. Within hours of her arrival it was like someone had given a new lease of life to my father. \n\nHe began sitting up, talking, taking an interest in things around him, eating - and even crating a fuss about bland food \ud83d\ude00.\n\nJust the love she brought has given my father a few more months. \n\nNTA - I have seen first hand the magic of love and I can imagine the thoughts that must have run in your father's head as he came to realize that his brother valued him so little.", "NTA i did the same thing when i lost my dad.

Apparently this is going against the grain here, but your uncle made this public by posting it on social media hoping for sympathy clout or whatever. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if he felt uncomfortable meeting in person, but as op said he could have texted, he could have called, heck he could have even video called. Either way he didn\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if op blasted him on social media without any prompting, but I feel that uncle here brought this on himself.

I know I need to reach out to my uncle to apologize, and I will (but I am waiting a few days for the emotion of everything to die down). \n\nI just want to make it clear that although the not visiting was the root of why I was upset, I wouldn't have said anything if not for the Facebook comment he made getting sympathy from strangers when he couldn't even send dad a text.", "I'm always wary of people who immediately after a significant loss, turn to public grieving, in search of sympathy.\n\nNTA\n\n*Edited after mixing up weary and wary*", "NTA He showed by his actions, how much he cared.  \n\nYou have done nothing wrong.", "NTA- You didn't do it out of a wholeness you did it out of a person who is traumatized by the loss of their father.\n\nIn the future and this is what I do sometimes is. I will write myself an email when I'm upset and I will send it to myself.  Then a bit later when I read it I will edit it down to a more appropriate response.  And honestly for me anyway, they tend to be a little more straight to the point.\n\nBut hey that's the great thing to begin in an adult. You can do a non apology.  Adults love those.\n\n\" I am sorry, just the caregiving out for my dying father over the last couple of months has really taken a lot out of me.  Reading your post reminding me how much My father wanted to see you, how any assistance would have meant the world to both him and our family.\nBut I understand you had to watch out for your own medical needs and put yourself first.  I should not have allowed my emotions to get away from me. I am still healing\"", "NTA. \n\nOP you are going through an emotionally draining time. You are angry at how the world treated your father. You are bargaining with whatever religious figures you believe in right now. You are not the asshole for being blunt with your uncle on his neglectful behavior. You are valid in your anger and your hurt. However, be cautious with what you know about your father. Would he want you calling people on their bs? If was the answer is yes. Keep on. \nNote: I recently lost my father 3 months ago to cancer, and like you. I watched as certain family members bragged about how involved they were, but yet listened to how hurt my father was at their lack of contact and support in the time he was sick. My dad was an asshole, so I know if I don\u2019t say something he would be disappointed in me. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Soft ESH - You are both grieving and taking it out on each other. Yes, the covid statement was probably a cop out for not wanting to see his brother dying. But it's clear that your FB comment is you lashing out in grief, and that's not fair either. He did lose a brother and it probably has been a hard few months regardless of how much effort you feel like he has put in. Should he have been more present? probably. But I also wonder if anyone actually talked to him about that while it was happening and asked him to be more present. I wonder if anyone actually told him that his brother was asking for him. Humans are flawed and complex creatures.\n\nI get why you said what you said, you lost your Dad and it's coming from a place of deep distress and grief. I empathize a lot for your situation - it's so hard, and when someone dies, all sorts of people come out of the woodwork and say all sorts of out of pocket things. But in this case, I fear you are (unintentionally) alienating your uncle and adding more drama to the pot.\n\nYou wanted him to hurt like you are hurting, but spreading pain doesn't bring about healing. I hope you are able to move forward from this. I'm very sorry for your loss.", "ESH. His actions are pretty shitty, he had lots of opportunities to see his brother before the end and squandered them. But you're also grieving and, I suspect, lashed out more from a place of pain than any desire to mend or heal. He fucked up and now he's paying the price, and while you're right, your timing was poor. Nothing was gained from this other than more sadness, even if your frustration is understandable.\n\nI am sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself and try to find compassion not just for yourself but the rest of your family.", "NTA What you did isn\u2019t some great thing, but THE LEAST your uncle could have done.was express his condolences to you in person, or over the phone, or even in an old-fashioned condolence letter. Doing it on Facebook, especially in this context, just comes across as performative in a gross way.", "ESH.", "Well this definitely does read as a 17 year old. Soft YTA, but it also sounds like a grieving teenager lashing out.", "Personally, I wouldn't have my family conflicts in the public arena of Facebook, but I absolutely hate people who post grief for clout. It's grotesque.\n\nYou didn't cover yourself in glory, and you may want to concede to family members that it was a bad move, done whilst grieving. You can retain your position that he let your father down. \n\nI would stay off Facebook. It's a shit place. \n\nSoft YTA leaning to justified AH.", "YTA.\n\nPeople grieve in all sorts of ways, there is no right way. Regardless of what his reasons were for not visiting, I'm sure they were valid. Just because he didn't visit in the past few months doesn't mean he didn't care, that he didn't love your dad, or that losing him isn't incredibly difficult on him as well.\n\nI do think he should've been there for your dad, but I'm not going to judge the reasons he didn't, because you really don't know the reason(s). It's hard to see the people you love ill. Some people are in denial. Try to be understanding. Your uncle has known your dad his whole life. Don't invalidate what he's going through because he isn't grieving how you want him to. \n\nIt was wrong to make that comment and I hope you can find a way to make it right. You're both going through the same thing. Be there for each other.", "YTA \n\nYou are nearly an adult and you responded like a child. You think you know, but you don't. The relationship between your father and his brother was probably a complicated one, and you probably don't know the entire scope of it because it's none of your business. Your father and uncle have a relationship over 50 years and you're gonna be the one to decide if your uncle gets to grieve in his own way? \"After dad became bedbound in early 2023 he stopped visiting...\" So...two or three months ago? You lashed out at him because you are a child and in pain. Doesn't make you any less of an AH.", "First, I am sorry for your loss. This must have been a very hard moment in your life and you seems to have handled it quite well, helping when you can, and being very mindful of other people's feeling through all of this.\n\nThat being said... soft, very soft ESH. You uncle really suck for not visiting and getting in touch.  But... everyone have reasons. Some people can't be around death and emotions. Most likely, he was taught really young to \"man up\" and never cry/show emotions, and the situation with your dad was too hard so he just avoided it because he was never taught coping mechanism. Doesn't mean he doesn't care, for all we know, it could really have been one of the biggest challenge of his life. Sure, it sucks he didn't show up. But publicly shaming him won't bring back your dad or change how the lasts month went by.", "YTA - first, I\u2019m sorry for your loss. But you dont get to gatekeep people\u2019s grief and mourning. Maybe he could have come around or maybe he was fearful of covid, but either way he also lost a brother.", "Long story short, you\u2019ve decided to humiliate someone for \u201cnot grieving correctly.\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA. You cannot police how someone else grieves. Your dad was brothers with your uncle far longer than he was your father. They have their own history. You don\u2019t need to agree with uncle\u2019s behaviour but you damn well do not get to shame him either.", "Gentle ESH. \n\nI am sorry for your loss, and I understand your anger about how your uncle went about things. But the more mature thing would have been to talk to him in private about how it made you feel. Even if over text. Even if after the fact. Maybe he had valid reasons, maybe one day you will understand them, and maybe there is no excuse. Commenting on his Facebook page was not the call, either way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
