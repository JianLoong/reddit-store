He wanted to die at home, and despite having amazing hospice carers supporting us, it meant my family did a lot of the caring. My stepmum is honestly some kind of superhero for everything she did, and me and my brother (23) tried to help as much as we could. I missed school to sit in with him so my stepmum could go out of the house, and stayed at night so she could sleep. Me and my mum picked up prescriptions and delivered it to them. I cleaned the house so my stepmum had less to worry about and could focus on dad.\n\nWell my uncle (dads brother) hasn't really done anything. My dad has two brothers, and the eldest visited him every week despite living about 2 hours away, and nearing 70.\n\nHis other brother lives about a 15 minute walk away- if that. After dad became bedbound in early 2023 he stopped visiting due to \"shielding from covid\". It's important to mention he doesn't have (or live with anyone who has) a medical condition that would require him to be careful about getting covid. My dad didn't say anything about it, but the one time I pressed the issue slightly it became clear that my dad was sad that his brother wasn't seeing him.\n\nI'm not completely sure I believe the covid story, and my mum suggested that maybe he is just scared to see his brother in that condition- which is understandable. It definitely is upsetting to see. But I can't help but feel like no matter how he feels, my dad felt far worse. Even if seeing him in person was too much, couldn't he call him and speak to him? If the covid story was true, my dads bed was downstairs. he could have waved through the window occasionally. Even a text would have been good enough, but he didn't even do that. Just went no contact, for no reason (and despite being close before that).\n\nThe day after my dad died, my uncle has this long, self pitying message on facebook about \"how hard losing a younger brother is\" and \"how difficult the last few months have been\". The comments were full of loving and supporting messages wishing him well. I don't deny that losing a brother must be horrible, but the comment about the past few months made me so angry. Yeah, \"past few months\" when you couldn't send my dad or stepmum a text? the \"past few months\" when our lives got turned upside down while he sat at home twiddling his thumbs?\n\nI left a scathing comment saying pretty much that, and a particularly hurtful comment about how my dads last memory of him would have been how he let my dad down. I'm not proud of it, but I WANTED him to to be upset. I don't understand why he gets to be the poor mourning brother when his actions haven't shown any regard for our family. My auntie (his wife) has left my mum a voicemail which my mum won't tell me what she said. I know it was bad, and I regret the really bad comment. But why does he deserve my sympathy when its been up to everyone else to actually do the caring?", "created_utc": 1681131720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hi5ud/aita_for_publicly_humiliating_my_grieving_uncle/", "score": 415, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep on. \nNote: I recently lost my father 3 months ago to cancer, and like you. I watched as certain family members bragged about how involved they were, but yet listened to how hurt my father was at their lack of contact and support in the time he was sick.

Yes, the covid statement was probably a cop out for not wanting to see his brother dying. But it's clear that your FB comment is you lashing out in grief, and that's not fair either. He did lose a brother and it probably has been a hard few months regardless of how much effort you feel like he has put in. Should he have been more present? probably. But I also wonder if anyone actually talked to him about that while it was happening and asked him to be more present. I wonder if anyone actually told him that his brother was asking for him.

I empathize a lot for your situation - it's so hard, and when someone dies, all sorts of people come out of the woodwork and say all sorts of out of pocket things. But in this case, I fear you are (unintentionally) alienating your uncle and adding more drama to the pot.\n\nYou wanted him to hurt like you are hurting, but spreading pain doesn't bring about healing. I hope you are able to move forward from this. I'm very sorry for your loss.", "ESH. His actions are pretty shitty, he had lots of opportunities to see his brother before the end and squandered them. But you're also grieving and, I suspect, lashed out more from a place of pain than any desire to mend or heal. He fucked up and now he's paying the price, and while you're right, your timing was poor.

You uncle really suck for not visiting and getting in touch.  But... everyone have reasons. Some people can't be around death and emotions. Most likely, he was taught really young to \"man up\" and never cry/show emotions, and the situation with your dad was too hard so he just avoided it because he was never taught coping mechanism. Doesn't mean he doesn't care, for all we know, it could really have been one of the biggest challenge of his life. Sure, it sucks he didn't show up.

Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it!", "Info - what does this other uncle do for a living?  Could the \u201cshielding from covid \u201c be that he didn\u2019t want to risk your dad deteriorating quicker if he came into contact with dad due to his being in contact with people who were potentially a risk?", "NTA, My dads brother was this uncaring as well, I don\u2019t understand it, but you are not the ah here by any way.", " Dad might have been let down by his brother,but it sounds to me like he at least had everything to be proud of when it came to his wife and children. The three of you seem like you did a wonderful job and I\u2019m really sorry for your loss. \n\n As far as your uncle,it seems you want to do the mature thing and smooth the resentment out a bit. If it will make *you* feel better,then do it,but I think you should ONLY apologize for the social media post,not for your words. The truth hurts sometimes but it should never be denied all the same. I wish you all the best moving forward.", "NTA   \n\n\nEnjoy it.   Deep down everyone is thanking the gods that someone said it.   At 17 there is a decent chance you can get away with it.. after all it was your dad.    \n\n\nI also hate that shit.   I've got several relatives who are quick to soak up sympathy on FB but who can't be bothered to lift a finger to help care for our elderly mom.    \n\n\nGot one cousin who was losing her shit on social media when our aunt died.   How she never got to see her to say goodbye and all that crap...   she literally lived the closest (within an hour).   My aunt had cancer for 5 fucking years.   But cousin was too busy to visit.   I wish I'd called her out on it.", "Wow, that's so crazy. I'm sorry to hear about your dad's illness but it's great that they've been able to reconcile. Wishing you and your family all the best", "exactly. as upset as you were at his inaction you didn't do anything until he made a big public display.", "thank you, and you're absolutely right.\n\nMy dad wouldn't want arguments at all, he was a very sweet and mellow guy.   \nI'll apologize to my uncle, I still don't understand him, but my actions weren't right regardless of how I feel, and my dad would hate the arguments. \n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your dad, cancer sucks.", "thank you, that's a really good idea. Most of my terrible decisions are the result of me reacting quickly and emotionally. I plan to text my uncle once it's all a bit calmer.", "He needs to apologize to you and your family but his type never will.", "No, don't apologize. He's not going to apologize for refusing to be there for you and your father. If you apologize, he'll think his bad behavior was okay. It wasn't. You had every right to call him out. He was pretending to be the loving brother, but his treatment of your father was cruel and unloving. Do not apologize.", "Please don't apologize, your uncle acted selfish and you called him out. His brother was dying just down the road and he couldn't be bothered to go see him. Everyone grieves in different ways but he should have went to your dad even if it hurt him to do so.", "NTA and you do not need to apologize. You are a child (technically) who lost their father, who sacrificed to help care for him while he was dying and who is not grieving. \n\nYour uncle is an adult who milked your pain and loss for social media points and sympathy. \n\nMy advice to you, as a parent in the internet, is let the adults deal with the fall out. Just don\u2019t engage in the topic any more. Avoid your aunt and uncle, let your mom and stepmom run interference and deal with the adults. \n\nUnless you used really offensive language don\u2019t apologize. If you used super offensive language send an apology that says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the language I used to express my feelings, it was impolite and unnecessary.\u201d That\u2019s all. \n\nOtherwise don\u2019t worry about it. Focus on taking care of you and your family. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "Don't you dare apologise. \nThis 'man' deserves to be utterly obliterated. He deserves embarrassment, he deserves shame. How DARE he play chief mourner for his Facebook audience when he was nowhere to be found when it matters the most. Whatever your aunt had to say on the matter means even less than your uncles empty words. \nIn case you couldn't tell, I am livid on your behalf.", "Maybe at most you can apologize for going about it via social media. But that's as much of an apology you owe him and even that is questionable.\n\nBut you also need to do what will help you move on and proceed with your grieving and healing.", "NTA \nDon't ever apologise for your feelings ... losing your dad, watching him suffer is one of the hardest things ever .. trust me I know .. lost mine 2yr ago and it still hurts", "Don't apologize, you're NTA! He wanted to publicly mourn someone he went no contact with, so you publicly told him what was up.", "He did isolate from other people for longer than most people were, but he is no longer completely isolating. He is retired so work isn't an issue but they regularly see their children and grandchildren who are all in work/school. He also recently attended my cousins wedding- in a room surrounded by people.\n\nA fear of covid is still of course possible, but I do find it unlikely. Even then, texting/calling would have been an option.", "Covid doesn\u2019t stop him from calling or sending a text", "Never show emotions yet he was begging for sympathy and clout on social media?? Nah he's just an ass.", "Phone calls aren\u2019t affected by covid. The uncle didn\u2019t even send a text", "There is a huge difference between grief and social media posts to get attention.", "You don\u2019t need to apologize to your uncle. You just need to heal. If anything, your uncle should reach out to you first and acknowledge how much he let his family down.", "there was no offensive language or anything like that, but bringing up that dads last memory of him was how he let him down was a low blow, and I'll apologize for directly wanting to hurt him and putting it on facebook.", "If he\u2019s interacting with other people in person that\u2019s a ridiculous excuse to make and you\u2019re definitely NTA", "It can absolutely stop from calling, some people are left struggling to breath in a way that makes conversations very difficult if not impossible and can exacerbate other symptoms which could make ADLs impossible, but yes if he could post on Facebook he could text which is why I included that above\n\nEdited to add: many long Covid symptoms line up with ME/CFS and severe cases of that can leave people unable to speak or even look at screens", "She decided to humiliate someone for \u201cnot grieving correctly.\u201d\n\nYou must have missed that part.", "how would you know ?  You know him personnally ?", "I mean. That\u2019s fine if it\u2019s what you want to do, but know you don\u2019t OWE him that. And make sure you do it in a way where he\u2019s not just going to turn around and attack you. \n\nWhat does your mom think you should do?", "The uncle was hiding from covid. OP never said he got covid otherwise I\u2019m sure it would be a different case and be more so \u201cmy sick uncle who got covid wasn\u2019t able to visit his dying brother.\u201d While he was stuck at home, nothing was stopping him from calling his brother.", "Right back at ya chief, how do you know that was just his way of grieving and not of being a selfish ah? Cause to me refusing to see your brother on his deathbed (without any indication of a toxic or negative relationship) is pretty freaking in line with being an AH.", "I don't know it is either. Aaaannnnnnddd.... that's why I am saying to OP that not publicly shaming someone is the best approach here, because they don't know. And if you are not sure, better err on the side of caution."]}
