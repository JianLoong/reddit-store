{"id": 21427, "submission_id": "14ri6up", "title": "AITA for confronting a mom at her son\u2019s grad party?", "selftext": "My son, David (18) played baseball in high school. His coach, Martin, is very beloved by the students and parents. He truly goes above and beyond for his players, as well as all students. He\u2019s developed a special bond with many of them. He is so patient with \u201cthose moms\u201d. You know the type, the ones who whine their precious child doesn\u2019t get enough court time, agree to a commitment and then let their child skip a ton of practices for no reason and are surprised their kid is then benched, etc. Martin was a great mentor to my son and I am very appreciative of him.\n\nA few months ago, Martin revealed that his wife had breast cancer. He was taking leave from work and said he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to mentor students for the time. Most of us understood, including my son. \n\nOne of the moms, Jackie, was one of the few who went past disappointment and felt that Martin \u201cskipped out\u201d on the students. It was frankly disgusting and everyone simply ignored her. Martin was replaced by a temporary sub. He did his best, but wasn\u2019t as good as Martin. Again, most of us understood. The season still ended well.\n\nMartin usually always attended graduations and would go to a few grad parties. This year, he didn\u2019t attend the ceremony. He ended up going to one party, along with his wife but then she had another round of chemo and understandably, Martin had to tend to her. \n\nJackie threw a party for her son. I didn\u2019t want to go, but her son and David are very good friends, so I relented. Martin had been invited but declined for obvious reasons. The boys weren\u2019t even commenting on that and were just having a good time.\n\nOne of the other moms mentioned updating the meal train we had set up for Martin\u2019s family. Jackie got huffy and said Martin was showing favoritism by going to one party but not the rest. She went onto say he could\u2019ve at least shown up to the last game of the season or graduation and they could \u201cfind someone else to stay with the wife\u201d. Another mom said \u201cJackie, that\u2019s his wife. They have two little boys. Of course that comes first\u201d. Jackie said that when she had back surgery, she made sure her husband kept up his commitments.\n\nI finally had enough and told Jackie she was disgusting. A woman has cancer! And she\u2019s over here whining Martin didn\u2019t attend festivities. I said her son wasn\u2019t as special to other people and she needed to get over herself. I then left, though my husband and son stayed. \n\nThe moms are divided. All agree I was right but some think I should\u2019ve skipped the party or just stayed quiet as it wasn\u2019t worth a fight. After all, Jackie hasn\u2019t changed her mind and is still trashing Martin.\n\nShould I have just kept my mouth shut?", "created_utc": 1688579849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ri6up/aita_for_confronting_a_mom_at_her_sons_grad_party/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she compared her back surgery to cancer is insane.", ">I said her son wasn\u2019t as special to other people\n\nI definitely wouldn't have said this part. But I think it's fine to have called her out.", "NTA. The reason rude people stay rude is because they get away with it.", "NTA. I think it's amazing you stuck up for him. Jackie sounds like an extremely vile person.", "NTA. This whole thing where we're socially expected to not call out the entitled bullshit behavior of people around us so as not to rock the boat is ridiculous and ultimately contributes to these types of people getting to the point of berating people to their faces because they've never been called on things so they believe they're justified. I applaud you for calling it as it is, personally.", "Hard One\n\nGood for you: You said what she deserved to hear\n\nBad: You hit HARD at a party that was for her son and lashed out at her, fighting, probably causing a major rain-on-the-party mood.\n\nYeah, you probably should have skipped her son's party since you knew how she felt and knew you were unlikely to stay calm if the topic came up.", "NTA, but I think you went too far. Certainly calling out Jackie over her behavior due to Martin's wife's illness was fair enough. But dragging her son into it crossed the line. And I don't see why you should've skipped the party; you had no idea what comments Jackie was going to make.", "I don't think you're an asshole but I don't think you needed to take a swipe at her son either. I also think you didn't need to make the remarks at someone else's celebration. This woman is not going to change. What you say will go to her will go in one ear and out the other. So, you got what was bothering you off your chest and it's time to move on.", "NTA.  By a mile.  If the rest of them wanted to stay quiet, cool.  This wretch needed to be called out in front of people.  You should have left her son out of it and just focused on her though.", "Nta. Trashing someone for not going to a party is not okay, even if their partner isn't sick but doing it while their partner has cancer... it's disgusting", "> I didn\u2019t want to go, but her son and David are very good friends, so I relented\n\nMaybe it's a cultural thing... but it seems a bit weird for grad party guests to be chaperoned by parents...

Indifference is no different than committing the crime, and the other parents need to stop enabling/allowing her to act so vile. NTA.", "NTA. Jackie apparently thinks her son is more worthy of Martin\u2019s time than his wife is, and she\u2019s not shy about letting people know it.", "YTA.\n\nThe moms were right; you should have skipped the party or kept quiet. Instead, you went to a party of someone you have issues with, used your past issues as ammunition to finally go off, embarrassed yourself and your family, and just made things weird going forward.

It\u2019s also very rude to insult a host in her own home, and meeting rudeness with rudeness is not generally a good plan for making an impact or keeping the moral high ground. That is why it is worth it to cultivate some good responses to bad behavior that make the offender feel how offensive they are without making you look like an AH. A method you could have used in this case is bland but incredulous questioning. Jackie: \u201cMartin could have shown up!\u201d You: \u201cMartin\u2019s wife has cancer.\u201d Jackie: \u201dSomeone else could have stayed with her.\u201d You: \u201cJackie, Martin\u2019s wife has cancer.\u201d Jackie: \u201cWhen I had back surgery, I made sure my husband made his commitments.\u201c You: \u201cJackie, I don\u2019t think you understand. Martin\u2019s wife has *cancer.\u201d* If you stay level but unrelenting and act as if the only possible explanation for her batsh\\*t insensitivity is that she must not understand the situation, she will either give up or lose it, in which case she looks like the AH, not you. Another useful phrase to tuck in your mind\u2019s back pocket is \u201dI beg your pardon?\u201d", "I wasn\u2019t \u201cchaperoning\u201d. All of the moms were invited to hang out together, drink a little and celebrate this phase of our life being over. Definitely not weird here.", "I am definitely not a mom who complains about any of the stuff I mentioned. If standing up for a coach who\u2019s wife has cancer makes me \u201cone of those moms\u201d, then I\u2019ll wear the title.\n\nI accept your judgment of asshole, however.", "yeah. must just be a cultural thing. We went to friends grad parties.. and family's.  \n\n\nMost of the time our parents didn't come to the parties of our friends unless the parents had grown close/knew each other.\n\nThen there were the \"other\" parties.. usually in the woods and with little adult oversight...  \n\n\nYour version makes enough sense.", "Lol. Sorry, but when you use a woman's cancer diagnosis to take cheap shots at one of your enemies, you lose the moral high ground. You can flex for Reddit, but I just find it very interesting you stormed out in a huff, but your husband and son stayed behind.", "NTA- Jackie made a public comment and got confronted in public, which is a risk she took when choosing to be an AH.", "ESH Jackie was a major asshole and you shouldn't have brought her son into the argument.", "Good grief NTA.  Martin\u2019s wife has cancer for crying out loud!", "Nah. I think it was perfect that she said that, because in reality her son isn't going to be considered special or relevant to other people & that fact is going to hit hard when she realizes how no one actually gives a shit to accommodate to her precious baby boy.", "No that statement was completely needed. She thinks her son is more important than a man's well loved wife! One who is battling for her life!  She needed to hear those words because she literally is too stupid to have common sense and already know it.", "Sounds like the moms were in a group so there may have been a chance that she wanted to exit quickly without calling Jackie what she deserved and left her husband and son there. And nothing about how Jackie is using a woman's cancer diagnosis as an excuse to talk shit about her husband choosing HIS WIFE over going to parties and games?? Jackie deserved to get her shit rocked.", "NTA.  Jackie is. Dreadful woman.", "NTA.  I might have left out the comment about the son, but good for you for standing up for Martin, and shame on every other parent there for not doing so.", "NTA you absolutely did the right thing. She probably will keep talking crap today just to save face and make herself feel better but I hope it eats her up inside and she learns to hold her venom inside.", "I hate how we (we being people; the human race) just decided that societal etiquette leads with keeping your mouth shut. People need to be shamed when it's appropriate. People need to be humiliated so they can hopefully take from the experience and not repeat their gross behavior", "Why?  Your kids AREN\u2019T as special to others are the are to you.", "NTA - someone is dying at an accelerated rate and she has the audacity to complain and compare it to her back surgery.

Jackie for obvious reasons but you because you caused a scene at a kid\u2019s graduation party. He was probably embarrassed enough by his mom\u2019s behavior but you had to talk bad about the graduating kid and make a scene embarrassing both the kid and probably your own son.
