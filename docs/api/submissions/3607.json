{"id": 3607, "submission_id": "z8wz8x", "title": "AITA for being mad about a Certificate of Deposit left for me being taken?", "selftext": "\nOK so the title pretty much says it. Yesterday I (23F) found a paper that said certificate of share, and it had a note with it from my grandma. It was from my grandmother (maternal) who passed away when I was eight years old. It was from her life insurance money and my grandpa wrote it up with a note from grandmas point of view (she was on her deathbed and unable to write). It said the money was to try and do something to make up for her not being around and it was for my future. It was for 5,000 dollars and had an interest rate of 4 percent. Meaning since it was from 2007 it would be worth around roughly 10,000 now. \n\nSome back story, my dad has been emotionally abusive and an alcoholic his whole life. My mom and him didn\u2019t love each other but she stayed with him for 23 years.  As if she was doing us a favor by \u201ckeeping the family together.\u201d \n\nMy dad is pretty narcissistic and my older brother (26M) is the golden child. He has always been favored by my father, and honestly most other family members as well. \n\nWhen I found the certificate, it had my name, and my moms name on it. Because I was a minor it had to have another name on it I guess? \nSo when I first found it I messaged my mom a pic of it. \u201cHey what is this?\u201d She replied that she had no idea what it was. I called the bank they did it through and they said the account had been closed\u2026. I messaged my grandpa about it next. And he said \u201coh that was written up for you when your grandma died\u201d I asked him if he knew what happened to it because the bank said it was gone. He said I\u2019d have to ask my mom\u2026 I ask my mom again and now all the sudden she remembers it..\n\nSo I message my brother. He knew all about them. He said that he had one to. I said what happened to them then??? He said that my mother and my father used them to BUY THE HOUSE THAT MY BROTHER NOW LIVES IN. \n\nSo my inheritance from my dead grandmother got essentially given to my brother. My grandma was the only other person in my family who had IBD.she had Crohn\u2019s disease. I have suffered with UC since I was 15 years old. And now I\u2019m 23 and had to get my colon removed and get two more surgeries this year. I\u2019ve always felt connected to my grandmother because of this commonality that we had. It feels extremely fucked to me that I was robbed of my inheritance from her. \n\nI messaged my brother and he can\u2019t seem to see why this is fucked up.\n\nMy feelings are extremely hurt. My mother signed the papers to withdrawal money with my father and getting 5,500 or so then instead of letting it be and me getting 10,000 now. AND they spent it on my brother. Am I an asshole for being extremely mad and wanting to go minimal contact with my family over this along with everything else over the years?", "created_utc": 1669828349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8wz8x/aita_for_being_mad_about_a_certificate_of_deposit/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was her gift to you, she could have given it to your brother if she wanted to, but she chose to give it to you.

In my local jurisdiction, it costs like $25 to take a case to small claims court (as long as the value of loss is under $15,000) and you can do it without an attorney.  It would be one thing if they had needed the money for your treatments or some other life or death matter, but cashing them out to buy a house for your brother is easily arguable as a misappropriation of funds held for a minor and they may have to repay the money.  Look up the magistrate court in the county where you live and see if they offer something like small claims court.", "NTA  I would see if she will pay you back.  She can get a loan.
