Maybe he can take time off work and nurse.  Maybe he can tell him mom to stay with his sister and hire some help.\n\nThis is important.  Family who come to help should primarily take care of the new mother who has just gone through a major medical event.  They do the cooking and the cleaning and the mountains of laundry.  They give the mother time to nap.  They support the mother by reassuring her she'll figure all the mothering stuff out, we all did.  They do not take over baby care and relegate the new mom to being their servant.", "NTA- when I had to fly with a broken bone the pain was so excruciating, that at 30,000ft I was screaming like a banshee.

Tell your husband that mil will most likely not do what her dr says as soon she is here and still try to help. You will be busy with baby and recovery and can't garantee you will be able to take care 24/7 that your mil does what her dr told her she should (most likely stuff like don't lift anything, move the wrist as little as possible etc.). Does he really want to take the risk that his mom doesn't fully recover bc she started using her wrist again too soon?\n\nThis setup can only work if you not only hire a nanny for help with the baby but also a 24/7 nurse to take care of mil. Can you do this?", "You are NTA-- Assuming your husband works full time; you'd be taking care of three other humans plus attempting to take care of yourself. I just had my daughter this most recent May, and having moved from my home state a few months before I found out I was pregnant, we had little to no help. I had complications and had to stay in the hospital a few extra days, so my friend offered to help about a week after I had my daughter, but she had some health issues she never told me about, and I ended up having to take care of her until her husband could come and take her home after work. My husband got home later (our cars broken so we walk 7 miles to/from work, so it took a while) and asked me where dinner was because his phone had died so my message letting him know what happened never went through, it took him a while to calm me down but I was sobbing all night because I was so overwhelmed from a colicky baby and having to take care of two other people when I could barley stand myself. \nMoral of the story-- don't take on extra burdens for other peoples happiness. Your going to need time to heal, and having an extra person that your just going to have to take care of is no help. Focus on what is going to be best for you and your little one. Also I'd rexcomend to make a \"mommy basket\"--all your comfort items and foods/drinks for after you give birth, because your going to want to recoop after a while.", "She needs to stay home to be close to the orthopedic surgeon who is repairing her wrist in case any complications arise after surgery.

But, your MIL can help in other ways such as sitting with the baby which will allow you some free time. And she won't be helpless with one broken wrist. She still has the other wrist.

There was no NEED for a nanny with any of them until I returned to work.", "Eh. My friend broke her wrist and had surgery to repair it. She was able to function just fine and even helped me hang a couple of shelves after, as she still had one good hand. She also cooked, cleaned, and went about her life days after the surgery.

She\u2019s not here to spend time with her new grandchild. It\u2019s not a time for family bonding. Just moaning about having to pay for both her and a nanny. \n\nNormally births are a lovely sociable time where families stick together. But here it seems they\u2019re only welcome if they have some financial worth.", "I think you\u2019re making an assumption your MIL will be absolutely useless without even asking her what her limitations are.  (Or if you did, you didn\u2019t mention that you spoke with her and that\u2019s what she said.). You\u2019re also narrowing down the possible solutions to either coming/not coming, and there\u2019s plenty of grey area there.\n\nAs for her helping: there\u2019s plenty of women with broken arms, wrists, etc. who still manage to take care of babies.  (My own mother broke her arm when my sister was an infant, and still managed to do the bulk of the childcare, to include changing, feeding, etc.). Hell, there\u2019s mothers with just one hand or arm, period, who still manage to take care of babies just fine.  Best case scenario, if all she has to do is keep her wrist immobilized (which can be accomplished with a cast) she can still help with nearly everything.  Will she be a little more awkward?  Yeah.  But infants are small and light and don\u2019t try to crawl away.  They can easily be picked up with the one good arm, with the other, broken arm acting as a light support.  It\u2019s not a huge deal.\n\nNow maybe your MIL is a drama queen who will use the excuse of a broken wrist to do absolutely nothing, but since you didn\u2019t provide that info, I\u2019m not going to assume it.  Absent info, it\u2019s also just as likely she could still do 95% of what a normal person could do, albeit with a bit more difficulty or awkwardness.\n\nSecondly, how about discussing some sort of in-between option, after having a long, honest discussion about MIL\u2019s medical capabilities?  It appears you talked to a friend who had similar injuries, but never talked to your actual MIL.  Maybe if she honestly can\u2019t help, a shorter visit now to meet the baby, followed by a longer visit later when she can help more might be a good solution for everyone.\n\nAlso, it appears your bigger problem here is your resentment against your husband\u2019s side of the family, which sounds like it might be a legitimate issue, but whether or not your BIL lives with you free of charge is between your BIL and your husband (and you.)\n\nSounds like your real problem is you think your husband is a pushover to his family, but that\u2019s separate to what\u2019s going on in this specific situation and how you can resolve it.", "YTA\n\nShe's not going to be an invalid. You're not going to get another baby to take care of. More like she'll be a 75% adult. She'll be able to cook, clean, help.

MIL can operate a vacuum with one hand, cood with one hand, get a grip. Don't shoot yourself in the foot and overreact here.", "Info: how will a broken wrist completely limit her from baby care or from helping you.", "People can function effectively using one arm.

She won\u2019t feel like it/ her doctor will advise against, travel so soon after surgery.  She\u2019s going to be on some powerful pain killers for at least two weeks post op.  Mil needs to be close to her Dr in case something goes wrong, for follow up visits etc..

It won\u2019t be safe for her to hold the baby until she recovers.", "NTA\nI'm in a hard splint right now post-op a severed tendon and there's no way I could help with a newborn. In fact, I work with babies and kids and I'm off work until I finish PT and get full use of my hand again. I'm having to wear sweats and pull-on shorts because I can't button/zip jeans lol.  Your MIL will not only be in a cast but will surely be on pain meds post-op which would make travel even more unadvisable, especially if she's traveling alone.  So your concerns are totally justified. \nWhat I don't understand is why your MIL hasn't called YOU and said something like \"I'm so sorry this happened, and I won't be able to help you as planned.  I wanted to give you a heads-up now so you can cancel my flight and maybe get a refund, or reschedule it for a few months from now.  I'd be happy to come when I'm fully healed and maybe even give you and DH a night out!\".

NTA, don't let this happen, and if husband makes it still happen, then do not care for MIL, leave all of that to husband, and let him know he is choosing to care for her instead of you and baby.  You could \"bounce back\" like a natural birther, you could be in desperate need of lots of support for months.  How can you know beforehand, you can't, so this plan is stupid and she shouldn't come.
