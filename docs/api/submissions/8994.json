Dropoff starts at 8. I drop my daughter off at 8:15-8:20 so the teacher could do her hair (most parents don't drop off their kids until at least 8:30). I don't think I've seen more than 4 kids between 2 teachers when I drop her off now, which is why her teacher has time to do it if we're there before 8:20.", "We do baths in the morning for a couple reasons. First, her mom used to give her baths in the morning before the divorce and she still does that at her apartment so we're trying to keep the routine somewhat similar between houses. Also, the teacher requested that she comes in with damp hair so it's easier to work with.", "YTA. Teacher is taking time out of her day to do something that's your responsibility and you don't even stick around to learn everyday.", "YTA. You need to stay every day and get SERIOUS about learning.

It shouldn\u2019t take that long to learn.", "Is there a reason you haven\u2019t been able to pick it up after she showed you twice?  This isn\u2019t rocket science", "But are you sticking around and watching her do it?

You recognized that your knowledge was lacking and you reacted by asking for help and learning the necessary skill. That sounds like great parenting to me.\nMaybe you should have done  that earlier, but all in all good job.\n\nEdit after reading OPs other posts. Yeah nope. Staying once or twice a week is not enough. That seems more like alibi trying. Stay every day until you can do it and then do her hair yourself at home.", "He probably should have mentioned that in the post.", "It doesn't take more than a few times watching.

I wore my hair down for years - well into my teens - because I didn't know how to style it. We did not have the internet to teach basic hair skills like braids and ponytails. My mom didn't know how to do hair either, except to loosely loop a rubberband around the base and call it good.

I have 4c hair and it\u2019s thick, long and just hard to handle. Plus he had all those years married and didn\u2019t learn to care for his daughter at all. He could easily learn some basic styles. Parents do it all the time.", "There's no need to expect yourself to be as good as the teacher right out the gate.

You learn how to do them by practicing and doing a whole lot of really shitty braids. Also, you don\u2019t practice in the morning. You practice in the afternoons or on weekends.

The majority of my previous comment explained my main reason.", "If you had time to drop off your daughter at 8:45 before, you have time to stay and learn from the teacher every morning.\n\nWith the info given I'll say NTA for realising you need help with you daughter's hair and asking for it, but you ex is right, you do need to learn how to take care of it ASAP. Also depends on how old your daughter was when you and your ex broke up, if it happened when she was a baby with barely any hair it's understandable, but if she was old enough to need her hair done you could have learned from your ex and in that case YTA.\n\nAlso this solution is not permanent. Sooner rather than later your daughter will move on from this teacher's class. Then what? What happens when you don't have anyone at hand to do your daughter's hair?", "Yeah this needs to be as *temporary* of a situation as possible. Curly hair is tricky and it's totally understandable that you would need some help figuring it out.

Because you would be ta if that happens. \n\nNTA for now tho!", "You should 'try' and stick around much more often - this teacher is doing something really nice for you, and you should be making every effort to learn and to make it as easy as possible for them.

By your own admission you are half an hour ahead of schedule, so you don\u2019t need to leave early.", "Dude, no. You should stick around every day and do it under the supervision of the teacher. The teacher can instruct and guide, but this is your kid and your responsibility. You need to step up.", "What would you have done if the teacher had refused?", "It doesn\u2019t take weeks to learn.  You just don\u2019t want to deal with your kids hair.", "Stick around, learn to do her hair and offer to buy the teacher dinner as a thank you.", "Trust me on this one man, you don't have to ask advice there, but there's a HUGE Google document they have on their reddit that explains different techniques for different curl types.

It gave me a starting point on how to properly take care of my curls and adjust it as need be as I learn more. \n\nI was never taught how to take care of my curls my entire life. I'm not the only curly girl who's gone through this either. I was so embarrassed of them for so long, but after learning more about them and how to take care of them, I love them so much. \n\nBy learning more about your daughter's hair, you're giving her something some of us curly girls never had when we were younger, your teaching her how to take care of them and you're giving her a chance to feel proud of her curls.", "In-person advice can be just as contradictory.

Heck, even my own mother sucked at doing my hair.

Luckily I\u2019ve figured out that you have to:\n\nBrush my hair when I get up, brush my hair at noon, brush my hair before showering, brush my hair while showering, brush my hair after showering, brush my hair in the evening, then brush my hair before bed. If I don\u2019t, it becomes matted, like long-haired a dog who\u2019s been neglected.\n\nAlso, you most certainly DO NOT comb curly hair. You need a hairbrush with bendable (but not too bendable) bristles. That way it can gently go through your hair without forcing it\u2019s way through. Combs force out the knots, causing hair to break. Whenever somebody uses a brush with the little balls on the end of the bristles, or a comb, you can hear the hairs snapping.

Sometimes asking for help means \"can you give me tips\" or \"can you tell me what products to buy\". The daycare worker told him that if he dropped his child off earlier, she would do it.  SHE OFFERED! So it seems the problem is that he's not spending enough money to have his daughters hair done. He is not allowed to accept help from someone who is familiar with that kind of hair."]}
