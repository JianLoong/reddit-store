If he was trying, he would be able m to put his own child's hair into, at least, a pony or a bun by now.", "Sounds like you don\u2019t need the teacher to do it anymore then. You should get them a nice gift as a thank you and get back to the normal routine. It\u2019s fine to ask for help while learning, but now you need to go back to doing it yourself.", "Honestly my kiddo has two parents and we\u2019re still trying to get their hair right. So many products have different outcomes. My hubby was the one who found a conditioner that finally actually moisturized the hair. It was so dry and brittle all the time. Now we\u2019re trying different brushes that won\u2019t pull and break the hair so much but it\u2019s still an issue at times. We haven\u2019t even tried styling, just keep it cut short and pin any hair out of kids eyes between cuts.", "Add ALL of this to the main post. You are learning hair styles other than having her hair down HEALTHY because hey, little girls like pretty hair styles with bows and stuff.\n\nI had a single dad doing his best and it sounds like you\u2019re doing a really great job. Cut yourself some slack. The people calling you and A-hole sound like they come from a bias of hating dads to begin with.", "It could be he's staying on days it is less busy and therefore the woman can afford the time to show him. It's faster to do hair than it is to teach. It's also unclear how long this has been going on and whether he's making progress. He's listening to advice on hair products and figuring that out, so if its been two months of every other week with all the Christmas/New Years chaos, he's probably doing fine.\n\nOP needs to check in with the daycare worker to make sure she's still okay with this, and possibly contact a salon nearby for extra education if he's not making progress fast enough with the current setup. But he's asking questions and trying to learn, and honestly sometimes it's hard. It took me years to figure out what worked best for my own kids' curly hair, and it changed a lot over the toddler years as their texture shifted. (Not all texture shifts, but some does. And one of my curly haired kids was basically bald until 2. There's a lot of reasons this *could* be Dude Shifts Responsibility To a Woman, and if so yuck and fuck him, but also lots of valid reasons he's still figuring it out and doing his best)", "Fuck sort of hair do you have? I\u2019m talking combing when wet. \n\nYou brush your hair dry? Jeez probably stop doing that", "This right here. It takes time for us to learn and maintain our hair.", "Yeah that's the obvious hint of 'you can't expect me to do this every fucking day', as if a teacher hasn't got more important things to be worrying about at that time of the morning", "Or even attempting to do things under the supervision of someone who can do it...", "Which he's doing when he can.", "I hate the \"if it was a mother/girl/different gender than the case in discussion\" arguments. I think it would be fine for a mother to ask a teacher for help so I have no problem at all for saying a dad can ask a teacher for help. Also if mom has the same curly hair and hair lenght as daughter shes got a huge advantage over dad an can shut up about him avoiding anything.\n\nNTA", "a few weeks? you are very optimistic. Girl dad of very curly haired kid here. Learning to do hair like that takes so much time....\n\ngod, all the lopsided pony tails..... getting flash backs here.", "Exactly.", "Lots of fucking people struggle with curly hair. So, not knowing immediately how to manage curly hair doesn't make someone a bad parent. Accepting help from someone who does doesn't make someone T A. Do you know how to manage curly hair? Do you know the different types of curly hair. Getting into hair care for curly hair is like walking into another dimension. My friends daughter had 4C curly hair and omg, it was a daily routine to do their hair. But her mom didn't immediately know how to manage her hair. She got help from other women who either learned to manage their own curly hair or their children's curly hair. \n\nY'all can jump down off your high horse.\n\nEdited for typo", "What I\u2019m saying is, that\u2019s a huge assumption. Maybe that wasn\u2019t part of the care routine for his daughter that he did mostly.. like, men don\u2019t learn the skills from a young age how to maintain and care for long hair like most women do, so maybe, like in my family and most I can think of, the girls all look after each others hair. OP might have been more hands on with taking her to and from school, kindy, appointments, picking her up etc the list goes on and on. There\u2019s wayyyyy more that\u2019s not in the post than what is. No possible way of knowing I\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong, or the opposite.. I was just pointing out you made a rude assumption, and that\u2019s all you contributed.", "The heck is this comment? \nI\u2019ve literally broken combs AND the hairbrush types being talked about above and my hair isn\u2019t that curly. My hair is thick and lightly wavy/curly. I like short hair because I can\u2019t stand all the prep I have to do on my hair just to be comfortable with how it looks. \n\nI\u2019ve showed up on a teams meeting after I tried to get it to flatten down and my boss literally asked if my hair stands up like that naturally, because it was at more than a 90 degree angle from my head.\ud83d\ude12", "Or even go to a salons that specializes in curly hair\u2026 or ask his ex to help\u2026 so many solutions he can find to do on his free time\u2026", "Since he used to drop her at 45 he should have time daily to stay until 45... Why can't he now?", "Yeah parenting is a very 'when you can' kinda job, you're right\n\n/s", "Lets be real, there's no way it takes as long as OP is implying to learn to do at least a good enough job for a 3 year old, and the rest he could have learnt from youtube or whatever as he went along.\n\nA few mornings worth of instruction from the teacher should be more than enough, if this is going on for weeks then that's ridiculous", "Yeah wtf mans has a job to get too. Cant sit around and play with hair all day. He should def compensate the teacher with money or nice gift but yall have some impossibly high expectations.", "He's not being blasted for accepting the help, he's being blasted for taking advantage of the help offered and coming across as though it's a long term solution and not a temporary one. \n\n\nIf OP comes out and also says he's talking to the local salon and watching YouTube tutorials every night, great. But he only stays once or twice a week to learn from someone who shouldn't even be doing this for him in the first place. This isn't a friend offering a favour, it's a worker taking time out of their work day when they should be watching multiple children to help him because she cares about the daughter.", "No one's blasting him, but he's just offloading a parental job onto a female teacher, and he actually needs to be learning this skill himself.  He's dropping the kid off and dipping out most days, which isn't ok.", "I imagine there are countless YouTube videos he could watch and learn from.", "So that his daughter can maybe have a good breakfast sitting at the table and not on the rush in the car", "Maybe he had to rescheduled his work routine?", "Nobody said all day. He used to do her hair himself in those 30 mins then drop her off at daycare and head to work. So if he's dropping off 30 mins earlier, why can't he stay those 30 mins before he heads to work at the time he used to?", "Taking care of your kid's basic hygiene is not an impossibly high expectation, it's a bare fucking minimum", "And you know he's taking advantage because.... you're the one doing her hair, and you're tired of doing it? Otherwise, you don't know if he is. He just simply accepted help. She not entirely not getting paid. They are still at the daycare. She's still getting paid for that child being there and daycare aren't cheap. She's getting paid for that child being there early. They aren't doing this outside the school. She made the offer so why do you all get to decide that she doesn't want to do it?", "That's between them. Maybe she likes doing her hair. If she doesn't mind and if she doesn't see it as an imposition, then we can't judge him as the asshole based on that. In which case, people putting their children in daycare can be classified as assholes because you are just offloading your job onto someone else. Parents who catch a break and the grandparents watch the children are also assholes because they are offloading their job onto someone else. \n\nI used to watch my neighbors child after school for him. Pretty much for free. He was newly single and working 2 jobs. They had been our neighbor for a few years. Our children went to school together. He lived just off our property, like his easement was across my property. He was going to have to work late a couple of nights but didn't have time to find a proper daycare or after-school program. We live out in the country, so there are not a whole lot of resources there. So he asked me if his son could go to my house that week while he tried to make arrangements. I knew he was trying his best. I knew it was hard to work and take care of a child. I also knew he was struggling. So after those couple of days, I told him I was more than happy to watch his son after school. My children loved his son, and it was no different than when he would come over and play. He would basically pay what he could, which would cover the cost of the extra food. I watched him for a couple of years until they moved. I'm still friends with him, and I still talk to his son. He didn't take advantage of my generosity. If i didn't want to do it, I wouldn't have made the offer, and I certainly wouldn't have let it go on for that long. \n\nIf the person who made the offer doesn't have a problem with it, then why is he an asshole because he gladly accepted that offer. YES, he should learn to do it himself, and he will, but that doesn't make him an asshole because he accepted her offer. That doesn't mean he's offloading his job onto her, and that doesn't make him a bad parent. She offered, and he accepted. \n\nI think he would be T A if he didn't get her some thank you gifts for being this kind to him."]}
