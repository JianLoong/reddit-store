I have her every other week.\n\nMy daughter has very curly hair that my ex wife used to take care of. Now that I'm alone with her half the time, I have to figure it out. I try but on my weeks her hair was mostly a frizzy, tangled mess.\n\nA teacher at my daughter's daycare has very similar hair to my daughter's so I asked if she could help me with my daughter's hair. She said she could do my daughter's hair in the mornings if I dropped her off earlier (dropoff starts at 8, I usually drop her off at 8:45 but her teacher says if I drop her off by 8:20 she'll be able to take care of her hair). She gave me a list of curly hair products to buy and what to bring to school. She also gave me some tips for washing and caring for it at home.\n\nI guess my daughter told my ex that her teacher does her hair, not me, and that she goes to daycare early now because my ex called me and asked if I really drop her off a half hour early every morning just so I could \"avoid doing her hair\". She called me a bad parent for \"relying on a teacher to do my job\" and for messing up the morning routine so we could get to school early enough for the teacher to do her hair (we used to wake up, give her a bath, I'd attempt to do her hair, we'd have breakfast, then go to school but now we wake up, take a bath, and eat breakfast in the car).\n\nI thought I was doing right by making sure her hair is cared for on my weeks but my ex feels very strongly about this so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\nEdit: I'm going to add some things to the post that I'm seeing in the comments. I am learning how to care for her hair. Her hair is healthier now than it was a few weeks ago. I have her hair down on the weekends because I still suck at styling it but it still looks good. The teacher really seems to enjoy doing her hair. I know she does other kids' hair but it's not exactly a set thing.

We live out in the country, so there are not a whole lot of resources there. So he asked me if his son could go to my house that week while he tried to make arrangements. I knew he was trying his best. I knew it was hard to work and take care of a child. I also knew he was struggling. So after those couple of days, I told him I was more than happy to watch his son after school. My children loved his son, and it was no different than when he would come over and play. He would basically pay what he could, which would cover the cost of the extra food. I watched him for a couple of years until they moved. I'm still friends with him, and I still talk to his son.

YES, he should learn to do it himself, and he will, but that doesn't make him an asshole because he accepted her offer.
