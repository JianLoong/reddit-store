Maybe you should do the same for your adult children. \n\nPutting dishes in the dishwasher is a very basic and simple request. They should respect your time and effort enough to clean up after themselves.", "NTA - They're adults and should behave like adults. They need to know that just expecting you to do it isn't a solution. Again, they're adults. They should move out if they don't like it.", "NTA.\n\nThese are adults not children, they know better.", "NTA.  Put up the sign and follow through.  They\u2019re adults and should know how to put the dishes in the dishwasher.", "Go ahead. Put up the sign!! Putting dishes in the dishwasher isn't hard. If you don't treat a space right you don't get to use it.", "Definitely NTA. I had the same rule. My mids in their 20's. I used to hear excuses about dishwasher being full so I told them dishwasher was only optional. If they couldn't use the dishwasher they were to wash the dishes and put them away. No dish ever was allowed in the sink. \n\nI stay up late and told them I'd be checking the sink daily at 2am. I don't care who is at fault. If there's a mess, everyone is woken up. The first night at 2am I found 1 spoon with peanut butter on it (everything else clean) and everyone had to get up and come down until it was cleaned. When I woke everyone up  I told them there was a huge emergency etc. Everyone was pissed when all they saw was the one spoon. That was the end of it. I never had the problem again.", "NTA... you can offer a get out of jail free cars, earned only after they wash 50 dishes.\n\nIf you can put a dish in the dishwash, thats next level lazy.\n\nOr you can have them buy thier own paoer plate and spoons.", "NTA but this is too passive. It\u2019s time to stand up and be blunt. 1) they are still your children, age of majority or not; 2) they are acting like children; 3) your house, your rules.  Dishes in the dishwasher- no exceptions.\n\nThey may be \u201cadults\u201d but they are still members of the household so they get chores, too. If they don\u2019t like that, there\u2019s always real adulting where they pay rent and buy their own food and no one is there to clean up after them. Stop being a doormat to your kids.", "NTA - but walk away from the kitchen yourself.  As you say, it's not your job to tidy up after them.  If ANYTHING is left in the sink, you don't cook that night.  You order in for you, SO & 15.\n\nRemember, you don't have to know who left something to enforce consequences.  And if any of the 3 adult children finds something in the sink, even it it isn't theirs, they can wash it up.\n\nOR - you add a premium to their rent to cover OP-as-dishwasher costs.\n\n*Edited to add a bright idea.*", "NTA - I am not sure why people ask if your kids pay rent. Paying rent does not mean you don't clean up after YOURSELF. It's not like OP is making them clean house, wash everyone clothes and pay $1500 a month in rent. I love this idea! I know it sounds mean to people who think banning people from using the kitchen is unfair, but leaving your dishes for your mom to clean when she is also making you supper is immature to say the least. Tell them this is step 1. Step 2 is a camera. Step 3 is a hike in the rent to cover maid service. Step 4 is that all three can go rent an apartment together.", "INFO:\n\nHow much rent are the adult children paying? I would increase their monthly rent and I would also start assigning them chores they have to complete to keep the house running, just like your 15 year old has. Sounds like they are too comfortable living like slobs rather than adults. \n\nI would make all of them pay a monthly rent. But if they are willing to do weekly chores, then the rent amount could be reduced if the chores are completed correctly (mowing the lawn, vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, someone can be assigned to load and start the dishwasher every morning.)", "Quit cooking until they clean up.

Active.. might be appropriate. A note will be ignored.\n\nI know this is drastic, but something that could help is physically designating plates to a specific person. I.e write names on the bottom of dishes and have each person only own 1 of each. 1 plate, 1 bowl, etc. \n\nIf they keep leaving their own kitchenware in the sink, confiscate it and have them buy their own.

I removed more than half of my dishes to the basement so that there were only enough dishes for each family member plus a few extra so they couldn't just keep grabbing nonstop glasses.... Which they totally did..... The family didn't like this...bwahahh but it's because it worked :)\n\nAt night delegate emptying the dishwasher to a family member  SO THE DISHWASHER IS EMPTY IN THE MORNING.

The one paid $100 last year (she's 27) and the other one was in school (M22). When he got out of school I told him he could have one year of $100, just like F27 did, and next year it will be $250.

Kinda makes a difference... If they're paying rent then it's not okay to ban them from the kitchen, which is ostensibly a part of their rent payments.\n\nNow, those rent payments seem really low to me.

They'll get defensive over their own colour plates if someone else uses theirs and they get the blame.", "She is surprisingly not terribly resentful. The only reason I can think of is this kind of long story...\n\nWhen they were all young, I used to assign chores. They came to me after a year or two of this and said they really hate assigned chores (who doesn't?) and claimed they would rather volunteer for things. I said fine, full well knowing they wouldn't volunteer. But I was tired of the fighting and they weren't actually that much help anyway because, you know, being kids and all, so I just went on doing all the chores. \n\nBut the funny part is that after I had a major surgery and was not able to even lift so much as 1 lb, I had my neice and her husband come and stay with us for a while to help me with my recovery. They told my kids they needed to step up, and boy, did they. (I really only found out this part of the story much later). From that day on, my two youngest kids have never once let me help clean up after dinner. I mean, they kick me out of the kitchen. Now it's just the youngest, because 2nd youngest usually goes to work right after dinner. But on the days he is home, he helps, too. \n\nThe other two never really pitched in, and I am pretty laid back and non-confrontational, so I just let it go. I ask for help with a specific task, occasionally.", "They do their own laundry, and \"clean\" their bathroom. I do still buy toiletries, but I am pretty frugal, so if they want something fancy, they're on their own.", "I suggested the same, a camera in the kitchen and color coded dishes.", "That\u2019s a good suggestion, except they will still be using pots, pans, etc."]}
