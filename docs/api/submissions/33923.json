When we told her she cried and she said she wasn\u2019t ready to be grandma yet.\n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t the greatest, he was 3 weeks early. The day after delivery my dad and his gf visited at the hospital. My dad held him for like 5 min after asking and when they were about to leave my mother in law came rushing through the door. She ran toward my bf who was holding our son, she basically ripped him from his arms and took off. All 4 of us where in shock as we couldn\u2019t believe what just happened. Since we didn\u2019t want to make a scene we let her hold him until we decided it was time to leave because we were all exhausted. She left. Still in shock I told my bf to please have a talk with her in a few days to tell her how inappropriate that was and to please ask when she wants to hold the baby. He did. \n\nA few days later we were finally able to go home. My parents in law visited us shortly after. Our son was asleep. When he woke up and started crying my bf went to the bedroom. His mum rushed after him and tried to grab him again to which my bf said that he was going to change the diaper and she cant have him rn. A few minutes later she left our apartment crying. My bf tried texting and calling but she didn\u2019t answer. About two weeks later she texted him saying she missed my bf like nothing happened. \n\nOn Christmas we were invited to her house for breakfast. We had a great time (or so I thought) until his mum disappeared. My bf said she left the house crying again. I honestly had no clue why\u2026 the baby was asleep the whole time and when he had a tummy ache I was holding him for 5 min until he fell back asleep. After an hour of her being gone we decided to leave. We said good bye to my father in law and my bf said \u201cif she is ready to talk it out she knows my number\u201d to which he replied \u201cshe isn\u2019t going to call\u201d my bf asked him what he meant by that and he just answered we know what we did and we should think about our behavior. I intervened and asked him what the problem was and what we did wrong and he just screamed in my face how horrible we are treating them and that we are withholding their grandson from them and that he specifically is not allowed near the baby, he a also called me a horrible mother and person for standing in between my bf family and our little family, which I never did. I told him that I was not going to let him scream at me like this so we left. \n\nAfter this me and my bf had a talk. I told him I was over this and I\u2019m not having toxic people like them in my child\u2019s life to which he completely agreed. \n\nMy parents however think that I\u2019m being cruel.\n\nSo Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1703770177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18stxps/aita_for_not_letting_my_parents_in_law_see_my/", "score": 398, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Create some distance and protect yourselves.", "NTA, Yeah, I think a talk is in order here. You both need to make it clear that you are the parents, and that anybody, grandparents included, that want to hold the baby need to ask first. Your boyfriend can make it clear that her initial contact with the baby right after birth, when she rushed in and grabbed the baby out of his arms, took you both by surprise. She needs to understand and acknowledge that was inappropriate so you can move forward and try to repair the relationship. \nHaving two sets of loving grandparents who are willing to help you out with babysitting etc. is always a bonus.

You are just getting used to motherhood and still learning to be an adult and the way you are handling yourself in this situation seems very adult to me.\n\nI think you need to\na) take a deep breath and find out what you, your boyfriend and baby need. I feel stressfree time to learn to look after your baby and bonding with them are key.\nb) find out what you don't need and set boundaries. These include not grabbing baby. Not coming over unannounced and no shouting in your face. I think you both need time away to child and reflect then you need to find someone who will mediate between you and in laws. Maybe your dad as he has seen behaviour? I also recommend limiting visitation to public places like a cafe or restaurant in the hope they can behave themselves in public.\nc) i'd consider looking at visitation centres were in laws can have supervised bonding with the child with trained professionals because you don't feel safe around them by the sounds of it.\nd) low to no contact is acceptable. It feels a bit like your in law is upset her baby is not a baby anymore and is upset this baby she cried over because she didn't want them just yet is now not her baby.\n\nPs.

Anyone who screamed in my face would be history.", "NTA i wouldn't have let her see my child ever again after ripping a newborn premature baby from his father's arms and \"taking off.\" what does that mean?? like did she run with the baby in her arms..? it sounds like his mother is a manipulative person with issues and her husband enables her. Your parents can either choose to protect you and their grandchild or mind their own business.", "I couldn\u2019t be as detailed as I would normally be due to Reddit limiting words, but the main points are in this post \ud83d\udc4d if you want me to go into detail with a specific situation let me know, there is definitely more I can write down.", "How can a 2 yr old have an adult child and a grandchild tho?", "How can OP and BF have a clear-headed talk with someone who runs out crying whenever she hears something she doesn't like?  It's an impossibility.", "She has had a child before she had my bf he had a heart disease and died after a few months. She has never attended therapy or seeked help\u2026 \n\nMy mum thinks it\u2019s cruel to take my baby away from the grandparents tho she agrees that their behavior is unacceptable and she understand why we are thinking the way we do. My dad however was going to rip them a new one when he heard what happened \ud83e\udee3", "OP, read this!", "My mum is just a really empathetic person and what\u2019s everyone to be happy. My dad was as upset as I was and was about to rip them a new one when he heard the story \ud83d\ude05", "Have you ever done anything to MIL or FIL that was either blatantly disrespectful or could have been perceived in that manner and you just aren\u2019t aware? Try to think of a link between her odd behaviors and an unpleasant encounter you all may have had. Of course the baby situation may have her out of sorts but maybe something happened that already had her bent out of shape? Of not then is your SO an only child?", "Yeah probably true.", "You're not taking the baby away tho?? Literally she just needs to ask first before holding him, instead of snatching him away from his parents. Toddlers understand this concept.", "Your parents can think what they want, you're the parents of your baby and only the two of you make decisions.", "First of all, she has ALWAYS done things like this, I have tolerated her behavior because it was only effecting me and my bf, now it\u2019s a different situation because it will effect our baby. There was no situation that could have caused this since she has been like this with me and also his ex gf. Yes he is also an only child due to his brother died a few months after being born due to a heart disease.", "Ah! Okay so some contact may be missing, just simply stating that this isn\u2019t new behavior. Mom sounds like she may have some attachment issues with son. Either way, it\u2019s your job as a parent to protect your child. As long as you\u2019re doing it for the right reasons, you\u2019re NTA. Just be as kind as you can while also setting firm boundaries, but as you\u2019ve already pointed out, this is behavior that mom is used to so the transition is likely to be hard.", "If they can\u2019t respect the parents they get no access to baby.  Their behavior has been toxic you don\u2019t reward toxic behavior", "I agree with this.  No contact with the baby until you've sorted out WTF their problem is.  They can't be trusted if they aren't willing to talk to you openly and honestly.", "Ignore that person you are doing the right thing. Your fil screamed in your face that should be the last time you see them.", "NTA. Their behavior is really strange and your reaction is appropriate.", "NTA \n\nPop on over to r/justnomil for some support", "Or....MIL is just very very very unstable, and FIL is a tempermental jerk who enables her. \n\nMom - keep her away from the baby.", "No, he was sleeping the whole time besides being fussy for a few minutes. And I\u2019m not about to wake him up just so they can hold him\u2026 he thinks we do this on purpose, but honestly i am not responsible for his sleep schedule \ud83d\ude05 if he wants to sleep he is definitely allowed to.. I\u2019m only giving him out to be held when he has a phase of being awake, which I have always done with everyone not just them", "The real problem is all the enabling behaviour from relatives otherwise she would have received a diagnosis and treatment by now", "That part was scary, it sounded like she ran out of the hospital with the baby. If I were you, I wouldn't want her anywhere near the baby after that incident alone.", "Menopause isn't the cause of her behavior, narcissism is.", "She didn\u2019t leave the hospital, she took off in the infant station (which is huge in this hospital)"]}
