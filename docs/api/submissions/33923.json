When we told her she cried and she said she wasn\u2019t ready to be grandma yet.\n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t the greatest, he was 3 weeks early. The day after delivery my dad and his gf visited at the hospital. My dad held him for like 5 min after asking and when they were about to leave my mother in law came rushing through the door. She ran toward my bf who was holding our son, she basically ripped him from his arms and took off. All 4 of us where in shock as we couldn\u2019t believe what just happened. Since we didn\u2019t want to make a scene we let her hold him until we decided it was time to leave because we were all exhausted. She left. Still in shock I told my bf to please have a talk with her in a few days to tell her how inappropriate that was and to please ask when she wants to hold the baby. He did. \n\nA few days later we were finally able to go home. My parents in law visited us shortly after. Our son was asleep. When he woke up and started crying my bf went to the bedroom. His mum rushed after him and tried to grab him again to which my bf said that he was going to change the diaper and she cant have him rn. A few minutes later she left our apartment crying. My bf tried texting and calling but she didn\u2019t answer. About two weeks later she texted him saying she missed my bf like nothing happened. \n\nOn Christmas we were invited to her house for breakfast. We had a great time (or so I thought) until his mum disappeared. My bf said she left the house crying again. I honestly had no clue why\u2026 the baby was asleep the whole time and when he had a tummy ache I was holding him for 5 min until he fell back asleep. After an hour of her being gone we decided to leave. We said good bye to my father in law and my bf said \u201cif she is ready to talk it out she knows my number\u201d to which he replied \u201cshe isn\u2019t going to call\u201d my bf asked him what he meant by that and he just answered we know what we did and we should think about our behavior. I intervened and asked him what the problem was and what we did wrong and he just screamed in my face how horrible we are treating them and that we are withholding their grandson from them and that he specifically is not allowed near the baby, he a also called me a horrible mother and person for standing in between my bf family and our little family, which I never did. I told him that I was not going to let him scream at me like this so we left. \n\nAfter this me and my bf had a talk. I told him I was over this and I\u2019m not having toxic people like them in my child\u2019s life to which he completely agreed. \n\nMy parents however think that I\u2019m being cruel.\n\nSo Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1703770177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18stxps/aita_for_not_letting_my_parents_in_law_see_my/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's astoundingly entitled of her and it's high time she learns that just because she wants something \"NOW\" doesn't mean she has a right to it.\n\nI don't know what your FIL means about him not being allowed near the baby or you getting between them and their son, but you should probably let your partner deal with his family. If they keep blaming you, that's not for you to solve or worry about. Perhaps put them on \"time out\". They need consequences to nip their manipulation in the bud.", ">When we announced the pregnancy everyone was happy for us, expect my mother in law. When we told her she cried and she said she wasn\u2019t ready to be grandma yet.\n\nSuch a red flag. \n\nI hate the \"YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID\" so much. If they explain what they are upset about it will cast them in a poor light, so they instead try to slyly accuse you of being diversionary by trying to communicate. \n\nSounds exhausting, NTA.", "Your in-laws are weird and toxic and you're NTA. However, if your bf decides he wants to give them a chance and wants his baby to have a relationship with grandparents, then you would be the AH if you tried to stop it. You can totally say i want nothing with them and it's his responsibility, but also his right.", "NTA She isnt acting out just because she cant be grabby-granny, she's also reacting to her 'losing control'\n\nShe's previously been able to press your bfs buttons with ease because she installed them. \n\nNow co-parenting with you is helping him to grow a shiny new spine, & preventing MiL from recreating her parenting style as a grandparent.\n\nShe cant and wont discuss the situation, because she cant and wont admit what she really wants.

If it's a loving and supportive one and this is unusual behavior?  Talk them through their midlife/grandparent crisis and the big emotions they are having about being afraid of not being around your baby enough or not having the grandchild relationship they dream of.  Figure out expectations or hopes and sort out some of those hard emotions together.\n\nIf this is typical behavior and they often are mean instead of loving?  Create some distance and protect yourselves.", "NTA, Yeah, I think a talk is in order here. You both need to make it clear that you are the parents, and that anybody, grandparents included, that want to hold the baby need to ask first. Your boyfriend can make it clear that her initial contact with the baby right after birth, when she rushed in and grabbed the baby out of his arms, took you both by surprise. She needs to understand and acknowledge that was inappropriate so you can move forward and try to repair the relationship. \nHaving two sets of loving grandparents who are willing to help you out with babysitting etc. is always a bonus. A strained relationship with his family may ultimately put a great deal of strain on yours.", "It sounds like maybe your MIL is heading into menopause-- that would explain the crying jags and feeling \"not ready\" to be a grandmother.  Before going totally NC, have your bf sit down with her and explain how she feels she's being cut off from her grandson (don't interrupt or deflect, let her het it all out).  DO ask her to be specific and talk about actual actions that happened and not vague feelings.\n\nI can't help but think maybe you are leaving out some details based on FIL's comment that \"you know\" what you did and the fact that YOUR parents are siding with your inlaws.", "Gahhhh\n\n> She ran toward my bf who was holding our son, she basically ripped him from his arms and took off.

I don't mean that horribly but you are just an adult and you have just given birth to a baby. This is a horrible and exciting time. You are just getting used to motherhood and still learning to be an adult and the way you are handling yourself in this situation seems very adult to me.\n\nI think you need to\na) take a deep breath and find out what you, your boyfriend and baby need. I feel stressfree time to learn to look after your baby and bonding with them are key.\nb) find out what you don't need and set boundaries. These include not grabbing baby. Not coming over unannounced and no shouting in your face. I think you both need time away to child and reflect then you need to find someone who will mediate between you and in laws. Maybe your dad as he has seen behaviour? I also recommend limiting visitation to public places like a cafe or restaurant in the hope they can behave themselves in public.\nc) i'd consider looking at visitation centres were in laws can have supervised bonding with the child with trained professionals because you don't feel safe around them by the sounds of it.\nd) low to no contact is acceptable. It feels a bit like your in law is upset her baby is not a baby anymore and is upset this baby she cried over because she didn't want them just yet is now not her baby.\n\nPs. Your boyfriend sounds amazing and supportive it can't be easy standing up to parents. I would talk to him and make sure you know how he feels and what he thinks is for the best.

Their behavior is really bizarre and it sounds like his mother is deeply confused about who the baby's parents are.", "I feel like there are some gaps in this story tbh.

It sounds like they feel like you are excluding them from their grandson.  Their reactions scream of desperation and stress.\n\nYou are the parents and should allow them to hold, change and interact with him as long as their actions aren\u2019t harmful to him.

Your mil might have a mental health issue.\n\nMy mil started crying\nbecause I asked them to not wake my newborn from a nap.  I ended up not taking naps myself that were much needed because she (a chain smoker) would come over snatch my newborn fresh from the NICU where she was on oxygen and hold  the baby's face against her smokey coat and cry and scream when asked to not do that.  My fil would either back her up or excuse her. \n\nWe had to have a policy that we went to them not the other way around.\n\n(Before anyone offers advice that baby is 25 now)\n\nMy mil was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had to be hospitalized a couple of times.", "NTA it's not HER baby.
