Often. This makes my grandmother very angry and I'm not entirely sure why because it doesn't directly affect her.\n\nSo yesterday she came home and she made a comment about the dishes not being done. This was something she didn't ask me to do and I know that maybe I should have just done them. The thing is though that I've explained many times that if she wants something done she has to ask otherwise I'm not going to think of it. I don't use my neurodivergency as an excuse to not do them. I just say that if she wants them done then she should ask me to do them. Same goes for anything else.\n\nI brushed it off even though I tried to explain it to her and she told me to stop making excuses. But today was different. She told me to clean something up and I said no shit because I was joking and we have been joking right before. She then made a comment saying Oh yeah that's obvious but I have to ask for anything else to be done. I tried to explain to her that since I had made the mess then I would obviously clean it up. So she sat down to have her breakfast and I said Oh where's my tea? She said I didn't hear you ask for one. And I said Oh I thought it was obvious. Which is something she would often say to me when the dishes weren't done.\n\nShe got really mad at me and then I said that this is how it feels every time she makes a comment about the dishes or something else. Because it doesn't always come to mind and I needed her to understand where I was coming from. Otherwise it just wouldn't stop. So then she started yelling at me a lot. She told me that I really pissed her off and I probably shouldn't talk to her. After that I left and I went to my mom's house and I'm still here. I don't really intend on going back in the near future.\n\nIt just seems like no matter how many times I explain this to her. She doesn't listen to me and it gets really frustrating because then I'll get in trouble for something on reasonable in my opinion. I just want to know if I'm the asshole. \nI texted her to let her know that I wouldn't be coming back and she said okay. Well don't forget the boat watching the cat on Saturday and then she said sarcastically. Thanks for doing my makeup tomorrow. For context on that her building is doing a Halloween party type thing. I was supposed to help her with her makeup because I'm relatively good at art and she was doing Beetlejuice.\n\nSo do you think I'm the asshole for what I said? Also, instead of listening to my reasoning, she just yelled at me to shut up.\n\nEdit: Since most people made the suggestion of a checklist and seem to believe that I don't do anything around the house.\n1 I've tried to do checklists and alarms but they don't work for me and never have. \n2 I do help around the house, but just because I hadn't that day, in one specific thing, doesn't mean I never do", "created_utc": 1667191122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi0vy3/aita_for_what_i_said_during_a_fight_with_my_nan/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I never asked for a tea. \n\nIt might make me the asshole because I didn't really explain to her what I said or what I'm saying it or that even that I was going to. Even so she was yelling at me so much. I couldn't get the words out. The day before she had called me lazy and was making other comments even though all I said was that I was going to have a bath.

You know that dishes exist. You know that they need to be done. Putting the burden on her to tell you and instruct you on what to do isn't fair. You are responsible for your responsibilities. You need to set a phone alarm or make a checklist, meet with her once a week to talk about what needs to be done and then do those things. You are going to have to try harder than most people, but that's still your responsibility. It's on you to learn how to do these things. Things. She would be doing you a disservice if all she did was coddle you. You need to figure out a system for yourself that works, so that you can function as an adult.\n\nYou don't need to remember to make her tea. She can make her own tea. But if you make a mess, you need to be able to clean it up without being asked.", "OP sounds like they are suffering from a form of EFD, which is a classic for people with ADHD. there are definitely things OP could do to help with their own EFD like making a list and doing their best to form the habit of actually checking the list and remembering that its there in the first place. but also grandma can get bent and stay bent if she doesn't even want to TRY to understand that this doesn't come naturally for everyone. and for those of you that also have ADHD I'm surprised by the lack of understanding. more than 70% of people with ADHD have another underlying disorder with it. just because you have ADHD like I do doesn't mean you also suffer from my BPD. just because you have ADHD doesn't mean you're in the same exact frame of mind as OP. you aren't them. some of these things might actually feel impossible for them. yes op needs to clean after themselves. but I'm 100% certain OP didn't make all of those dishes in the sink by themself. why should it be expected of them apart from everyone else in the house that contributed to the dirty sink? with that said I too would not touch the sink unless asked. hell at this point if op were to come over, they should do their best to wash the plates they use as soon as they're done with it. that way the next time they're asked they can give a definite No. not OP's mess.\n\nBuuuut if you really want to get along with everyone then I'd suggest sitting down and asking them for a set chores for you to take care of each week op. let them give you at most 4 chores. add it to a list. print/write the list out onto something that you know for certain you'll see everyday.(sticky note on a mirror for example) pick one chore to keep up on each day. if you feel you can do higher numbers than what I suggested than more power to you!  \n\n\nop is NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA\nYou didn't offend her, you had her come in your shoes.
