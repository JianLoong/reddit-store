However, afterwards their mind changed and my mom decided she did want to have a baby, so I came along. Being a new mom turned out to be really hard for her, and my dad worked full time so he wasn't really around all that much.\n\nWhen I was 1 they ended up divorcing. Mom did send me cards and gifts on birthdays and holidays. I'll admit we didn't have a great bond during my childhood and I didn't have much contact with her, but have a strong relationship now and we've been in regular contact for the past few years.\n\nDad remarried when I was 7 and I had a half sister. My stepmom is a kind woman, don't get me wrong, and we've always gotten along - but she's not my bio mom.\n\nI'm getting married later this year. Dad will walk me down the aisle and my stepmom is of course a guest, but she's not going to be doing the \"mother of the bride\" duties. It's not really that much, just greeting guests, hanging around with me when I'm getting ready and giving a speech. I would like my mom to do that, and she's been really excited about it.\n\nNow the issue at hand is my stepmom is very upset. She told me she thought I would ask her, and I explained everything to her as best as I could but she's still acting kind of upset.\n\nMy dad is also saying I can do what I want, but it's not the right thing and I'm being hurtful.\n\nI've got people telling me all sorts of things but I don't think I'm in the wrong here.

Teenage years? Or in your 20s?~~\n\nEdit: YTA  .. yes it's your wedding, your choice, you r not obligated to anyone and YOU can still be An asshole.. \n\n>My mom and stepmom don't really get along, and my mom doesn't want her to be around. I don't want her (mom) to feel like I'm not prioritizing her.\n\nYou r doing this just to Please you bio mom who by own own admission Abandoned you (yess taking a few trips and sending cards is not parenting) \n\nYou are calling your step mom \"moody\" just because she is upset? Ohh how can she be upset for a child who is not even hers and still raised her and Attended her all achievements and be treated like shit when all the hard work is done.. right?? \n\nEdit 2: so your half siblings from your mom's side get some postion and your step mom gets nothing?? Wowwww I really hope this is a troll post ... \n\nYou r a Massive asshole and so is your Mom and I feel sorry for your stepmom..", "Oh man. I'm gonna go against the grain here and say YTA for treating your stepmom like she's no different than any other guest. She should have more of a presence in this event and in your heart - unless the reality is that she mistreated you or you have a bad relationship of course - than a guest. And arguably she was MORE of a 'mom' to you then your bio mom ever has been, but honestly it's not necessary to prioritize one over the other. You should honor and include them both in some 'special' things. Even if it isn't the SAME special things - one could help you get ready while the other helps to greet guests. Obviously there is room for more than one speech. \n\nI'm happy for you that your relationship with your bio mom is healing and as an adult you will get to have a healthy relationship with her, but I don't see why that should 'bump' your stepmom.", "It is easy to parent an adult child. You can be friend and do all the fun things. but to parent a young child is hard. Your Stepmom got to do all the hard work and your bio mom gets all the benefits. Unless your stepmom was a bad person, or treated you badly you need to remember she was there for you. Ultimately it is your decision but from the outside looking in your are making it seem like your stepmom is a no one to you. If you truly have no relationship with her then you can continue to have no relationship. If you have/had a relationship with this women maybe you can find a place for her in your wedding party. Both women can participate just like bringing you up.\n\nAre you the AH. Hard to say.", "Your not the asshole per say but your not nice either. So your mum couldn't raise you. This woman has always been kind to you and been I  your life through he difficult years. \n\nBio mum repairs the relationship after you don't need raised anymore... so all the fun none of the responsibility of raising you. So of course the woman who would send gifts to relieve her guilt and is now your friend but didn't help raise you will be the mother of the bride duties at your wedding.\n\nIt's your choice as ita your wedding but I think you chose wrong and the choice can't be undone. You've step mom will always be hurt by this, she put in the time... she gave you the love and as far as I can see her only fault is she isn't biologically related to you.\n\nSharing dna doesn't make her the right choice.", "INFO:\n\nDid your mom raise you at all or did she physically re-enter your life as an adult? By the sounds of it she was a deadbeat until you no longer needed parenting so it's understandable that the people who did all the heavy lifting would be upset.\n\n\nEdit from comments:\n\nYou mention half-sisters, are they her children and did she bother to raise them? \n\nFrom your comments I feel awful for your stepmother. She's earned the honour of being acknowledged as more than just a guest. Your biological mother has earned no such honour and the mother of the bride is an honour. If I was your stepmother or even your father I wouldn't waste another second on you because clearly their hard work means nothing to you and just showing up after it was all done would have meant more.", "Do both moms. When I married, my bil walked me down the aisle (dead dad) and handed me off to my mom who then gave me away. Weddings don't have to be conventional.", "So let's summarize this: your stepmother raised you, and your bio mom came back because she no longer has responsibilities towards you, and it would be easier as adults to form a relationship. So bio mom is now getting mom benefits just because you're related? OP, you do realize your mom literally abandoned you when she was supposed to step up and raise you but instead decided to wait until you weren't a kid anymore.\n\nYTA, it's your wedding, but honestly, you should have more respect towards your stepmother.", "YTA I don\u2019t care if this gets downvoted to hell. Your stepmom was around for the actual child rearing and your mom waltzed back into your life when the hardest parts were over. Your mom is a selfish flake and I think it\u2019s honestly deplorable that you\u2019re putting her on such a high pedestal when she didn\u2019t earn it. You say it was her choice to have you, then she dipped when it got hard. Irresponsible and disgusting behavior on her part, and cruel behavior on your part.", "[deleted]", "YTA - you're doing this to appease your (absent) bio mom ; your step mom raised you and even by your own admission, was there when your bio mom wasn't.", "YTA. Your dad is right, you can do what you want but that doesn\u2019t make it the right thing to do. Your bio mom did the absolute bare minimum for most of your life yet you are picking her over your actual mom who was there for you, took care of you, raised you. To prioritize the person who didn\u2019t prioritize you, over her.  What a slap in the face to your poor mom.", "Im going YTA, you say you appreciate your stepmother for stepping up, but you let the woman who left you dictate how you have your wedding and there to exclude your stepmother. If you had a bad relationship with your stepmother I'd be more understanding but you said that she's a kind woman who you've always gotten along with, this must be a major slap in the face for her.", "You have the right to choose who you want in your wedding. But also if your stepmom has been there for you as a loving parent in you bio mom's absence, then she will likely continue to be hurt. \n\nUsually people just want to feel acknowledged in some way. You by no means need to do anything for your stepmom on your wedding but realize that she may realize her lack of place in your life and the relationship may change on a foundational level. When people precieve themselves as unimportant in the lives of people they love and feel rejected, they tend to pull away and or eventually remove themselves from the situation. Usually at weddings the important people in your life are involved or acknowledged, stepmom may just be grieving the relationship she thought you had with you. Just be ready for the fallout and be confident in your choice. \n\nHowever you would be YTA if you are pushing your stepmom aside to please your bio mom. If you are doing it to prove loyalty for your bio mom over stepmom, to potentially bring you two closer then you are an absolute asshole. Kinda seems like you want to shove stepmom aside to soothe the ego of bio mom and that's pretty gross if she didn't raise you but wants all the honors of being mother of the bride without being a mom during your formative years. If this is some show for bio mom then you and her are both asshole as well. \nIs biology and pleasing the absent parent more important than the person who raised you and loved you as mother? \n\nIt's your wedding but you are also kind of the asshole for throwing your stepmom in the bin for your mom, who seems to have a bit of a fragile ego that you are all to happy to stroke.", "NAH. I'm going to put it into perspective for you. Basically you're telling the woman who was around for the actual raising of you that you would rather the woman who left when things got hard and swanned back in when the difficult part of raising you was over as MOB. \n\nYou're allowed whatever you like for your wedding, but be prepared for your Step-Mom to feel hurt that you think biology trumps who actually raised you.", "From what you've told us, it appears that your step-mother had a much greater role in your upbringing than your mother. As such, she is for all intents and purposes, more of a mother to you than your actual mother. She is understandably upset, but it is ultimately your choice.\n\nNAH", "Nah...but you know wedding dont have to be by some imaginary book right? You can have two mother of the brides...", "YTA - your wedding you decide of course\u2026but your mom ditched you, wasn\u2019t there for your childhood while step mom was. Now that you are an adult and only over the last fees bio mom came around and is somehow more worthy than step mom? You earn the title mom, your bio mom basically ditched her title when she walked away. Step mom who didn\u2019t have stepped in and assumed the role and this is the thanks she gets. It is disrespectful imo.", "yta. your bio mom abandoned you and your step mother was the one wo raised you and now you're putting bio mom over the parent that chose you. yta and i hope your step mom stops doing mom things for you now that you've got your real mom.back. did you ever ask your mom why never stood up for you when you were younger oh thats right she fucked off on you and now you're fucking off on step mom. apple doesn't fall too far from the tree", "NAH.  It is ultimately your decision who your want with you during your wedding.\n\nBut I can also understand why your step-mom is really hurt.  She helped raise you from the age of 7 after your bio mom left, and I\u2019m sure it stings to be tossed over in favor of someone who only came meaningfully into the picture once you were fully an adult and the hard work of parenting was done.", "Yta for choosing the person that abandoned you over the one that was there for you. But it is your day and you can do whatever you want to, just don\u2019t be surprised when you lose you stepmom over this", "Love>>>>blood", "I\u2019m going to say that YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re turning your back on the woman who actually raised you when you were a child in favor of the one who is only now present after the hard work is done. I suspect that you feel so grateful to have any crumb of attention from absent bio-mom, that you\u2019re willing to hurt step-mom, who actually was a mother to you.", "From this angle YTA. Mom went against the original plan and had a kid and then decided it was too hard but now gets the mom benefits. Nice.", "Tbh, I despise people like your bio mother. She abandoned you when you were a child and waltzed back into your life when all the hard job of raising a child was already done. So your stepmom did the job, but bio mother takes the credit. It is your wedding and your rules, but still YTA.", "If your bio mom cared about you, she wouldn\u2019t put restrictions about your stepmom on her participation. Who is being loving to you in this scenario? Who is making this a good wedding for you?", "YTA here OP and your comments solidified that judgement. If you go through with this don't be surprised if you drive a wedge between yourself and your father for your awful treatment of his wife. I refer to her as his wife instead of your stepmother because after this I'm sure she'll (rightfully) want absolutely nothing to do with you", "After reading your comments, **YTA**. Big time. This woman (stepmom) was there for you doing the parenting, attending your milestones and events, and your biomom was not. you said she sent cards and went on a couple trips and only connected during college. So your mom AND your mom's children have a part in your wedding and SM doesn't? That's cold.\n\nI get you can do whatever you want with your wedding but prioritizing your biomom and having SM just be a guest is pretty cruel. They should at least share duties.", "NAH\n\nYour step mother clearly cares about you. Maybe she thought you were closer than you feel the pair of you are? Or maybe she thought you might be willing to share some mother of the bride duties between your bio mum and step mum. Either way doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s being an AH\n\nI can\u2019t call you an AH either because it\u2019s your wedding, your mum, and ultimately what you\u2019re more comfortable with", "NAH. \n\nI think this is a case of you and your stepmom having different perceptions of your relationship together and how that fits into the role you want her to play at your wedding. \n\nTo you, it seems like she's more of a guest and to her, she probably sees you as family and wants to participate as such. \n\nAt the end of the day, it **is** your decision, but I don't think finding ways to include your stepmom detracts from the role your bio mom will have on the day. Could you toss her a bone and at least have her in the bridal suite while you're all getting ready?", "NAH, but I feel like they both can do those things. It doesn\u2019t have to be one or none. Seeing as how you  get along with her, it would be a kindness to let the woman that helped to raise you stand along with your mom.", "NTA - it is your day and certainly your choice.\n\n\nThat said, I can understand why your Step Mother is upset and I hope you do too.", "No reason they couldn\u2019t share. She raised you. You love her. She\u2019s your mom.  YTA.\nYou\u2019re having the fantasy feels for the absentee parent. Very common.", "NAH\n\nIt's your wedding you can do what you want but I understand where your step mother is coming from.", "NAH. I get your feelings and I get theirs. But honestly I think it's a good idea to put in some more effort to also include your stepmother and honour her role as well. Have a conversation about it with her in which you tell her you absolutely value her and talk over how to include her.", "I don\u2019t think YTA, but I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re walking on egg shells about this. One is your bio mom, she gave birth to you, sure, but then bailed and only sent cards for your birthday, easy peasy\u2026 but the lady your dad married raised you. Society has pushed everyone to think we owe something to parents even when they weren\u2019t all that good at the job. Your bio mom took the easy part and is basically reaping the benefits planted by a woman who was more actively involved as a mother figure. I get that you probably feel this need to not damage the frail and recent bond with the bio mom, but your dad is right; you are making a mistake. Again, NTA yet here but you could become one if you don\u2019t give the woman WHO RAISED YOU the place she deserves.", "YTA and so wrong on this. Your bioMom couldn\u2019t be assed to be in your life much from 10/11 till you finished college. She did the bare minimum before that and you prioritize her feelings over the people that have been there for you every day. This is how you want to start the next chapter of your life?", "YTA. A mother is the one who raises. Your mother abandoned you for whatever reason and her way to stick around was with cards and gifts? She didn't participate in you education actively, as you put it she wasn't there when you were sick or making a temper tantrum. \n\nYou can choose who you want in your bridal party, but this is a reminder that your own mother didn't choose you. Your stepmother did and you're leaving her out of something she wanted and it's hurt by that.", "YTA, your stepmom raised you, while your mom sent cards and gifts? \nAnd now you\u2019re excluding someone who stepped up throughout your life for someone who sent cards and gifts, because she doesn\u2019t like your stepmom? \nThaaats.. a decision. \nLike your dad said, you can do what you want but be prepared for your relationship with your stepmom and by extension your dad and half sister to blow up. \n\nAlso your dad is right, it\u2019s not the right thing and you are being hurtful.", "You should take some time to think about whether you're doing this because you have a great relationship with your mom, or because you wish you had one. Abandonment does this to a person- makes you so desperate for their affection that you lose the ability to make good choices. \n\nIt's also easier for you to cast your stepmom aside because she has always been there for you, and you expect her to always be. If you don't have a good relationship with her, you don't need to have her in your wedding. But make sure that's what this is", "So step-mom did all the hard work while bio-mom couldn't be assed to come visit.  Bio-mom comes back for a relationship once you're not a kid and she doesn't have to do anything.  Step-mom gets the shaft because she didn't push you out.  \n\nOk.  \n\nIt's your wedding and your choice, but everyone can judge you for your choices.  \n\nYTA\n\nYour mom is claiming credit during these activities and speeches for the work your step-mom did.  Must really hurt your step-mom.  \n\nI feel bad for her.", "Yta- I cannot put it any better than others already have", "YTA. From the post and comments it really sounds like your stepmom was effectively your mom growing up and that you have (had, I suppose) a parental relationship with her. Why in the world would you relegate her to standard guest in order to honor the woman who virtually abandoned you as a child? Sure, it's your right to. But exercising that right like this is a dick move at best", "YTA.", "YTA", "NAH/slight YTA, \n\nYour mom wanted a kid then didnt and walked out of your life. Then reconnects once your an adult and all hard work & Child raising is done. \n\nYour stepmom has a right to be upset, by your own admission she was kind and you get along and you being in her life for 2 decades she probably considers you on some level her daughter. While your mom just waltzed back into your life well into adulthood.\n\nAt the end of the day though it is your wedding and you can assign roles how you see fit", "YTA. while it is your choice to decide what you want at your wedding, I\u2019m getting the feeling that your mom wasn\u2019t around much when parenting would\u2019ve been hard, and your stepmom was. Now that you\u2019re an adult and parenting is easy, your mom wants to have a relationship with you. This must be quite a slap in the face to your stepmother. I think you should reconsider.", "NTA. It's your wedding but your stepmom was there while you were growing up and your biological mom sent cards. I feel sorry for your stepmom.", "NTA So what if she raised you since you were 7... so what if she was your mother all this time... now that your bio mom is back.... \n\nIt's your wedding...you can do whatever you want... but there is really no place in your wedding for your stepmother more than just a guest?", " NTA but only because it\u2019s your day.  This will be very hurtful to step mom.  Why not recognize the reality and involve both equally?  If they can\u2019t get along that makes them AH but if you choose one over the other expect a lot of hurt.", "NTA, why not ask both of them to do the honors?", "NTA because it's your day, but if I were your stepmom you can be sure that I will not put effort in our relation anymore and next time you need help, money, I don t know, I will send you ask to your Bio Mom, your stepmom should focus on her bio daughter at least what she does will be seen...", "NTA. But why not share the duties between the two. If it's not that big a deal. brides do it when dad and stepdad walk them down the aisle.", "NTA.  I understand why your step mom would be upset tho...why can't they share the duty, or at the least, give your step mom a different type of duty so she is still a part of the big day?", "NAH \n\nSo, greeting guests means what? After church when we walked out we stayed by the church doors and as the guests filed out we greeted them, thanked them for coming and they have their congrats. But this was both \nsets of parents then leading up to us. \n\nIf this is what you\u2019re doing why would you not have stepmom standing right next to dad while receiving guests? If greeting guests is a MOB thing, then I\u2019d think it\u2019s a FOB thing also? Are your new in-laws in this receiving line also? \n\n\nAnd it\u2019s really not all that much trouble to have her in the room where you\u2019re getting ready. I\u2019m assuming your bridesmaids will be there also? \nThis one seems petty to me, like there\u2019s not really a reason for it other than exclusion \n\nAnd lastly, I\u2019ve never seen anyone but the best man give any kind of speech at a wedding. (But that could just be the norm where I\u2019m from) \nIf your dad is making a speech then sm can stand up there with him. She doesn\u2019t have to talk, but it\u2019s the acknowledgement that they are together and she\u2019s a part of your life, and his speech should reflect on that.", "NTA.  It is your wedding and your decision.  It sounds like it would mean a lot to your stepmom to be involved though, so is there some role she can fill in the wedding?  It sounds like she loves you and wants to be included in your big day as well.", "Reply to this when there is a update", "NTA. It\u2019s your day. If you feel you\u2019d like to\u2026 maybe there is a task or something you can designate for your step mother just to make her feel included. But that motherly stuff can definitely go to your bio mom. \n\nI just got married, I used a crochet hook to get the back of my dress buttoned. It was a small but special moment that my mom and my aunt (both very special to me although my mom is my world) help get my dress on. It made the moment so special to know they were both there.", "Yta. Yet again, the classic case of the child favoring the absent parent. Looking at your replies, it seems bio mom is bitter over stepmom and is guilting you to prioritize her. And you are", "Leaning towards NAH (maybe your dad is very slightly TA for pressuring you, but I don't think that's the key point).  It's your wedding, you're absolutely entitled to have it however you want, but she's also entitled to feel disappointed that you don't see her in the way perhaps she thought you did.  \n\nAs others have suggested, you could find some other symbolic role for your stepmom to acknowledge the role she's played in your life.  Maybe they could share the role, maybe she does something different, you can really do anything with it.  A little kindness can go a long way.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, you can do whatever you want, but maybe you could\u2019ve handled differently, maybe telling BOTH of them that you want them BOTH to do that for you", "NTA. It's your wedding, you can ask one of them, both of them or neither of them if you want to.\n\nSadly, all three of your parents are being at least somewhat manipulative over this.\n\nYour father is just straight up emotionally manipulating you with the \"you can do what you want BUT you're doing the wrong thing.\"\n\nYour biomom is pressuring you to keep your stepmother away from her.\n\nAnd your stepmom assumed she'd be the one asked and is now putting it on you that you've upset her.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. I can understand your SM being disappointed, however the mature and loving reaction if she really cared about you and your wedding more than what she wants would be to (bluntly) suck it up and do what she could to make sure your wedding was the best it could be. Instead, she (and your father) are making a point of being upset and making a scene.", "NTA. You choose who you believe was the most important person for that role. Getting guilt tripped on that decision is kinda trashy as it's what it means to you and no one else. The life of step-parents is definitely not an easy on but it doesn't mean you have to put them in your bio mom's position.", "[deleted]", "YTA - Your bio mother was absent by choice, your step mother chose you. She raised you, she invested her time, energy and care into you. You should include her and your bio mother should suck it up. She made her choices and they have consequences.", "NTA. Your wedding. Your choice.", "NTA\n\nStepmother is only the AH because she's not getting over being upset and making the wedding about her rather than OP.  Dad isn't helping here either. \n\nThe mere fact that she's offended by OPs decision means she felt entitled to the MOB position,  whereas it's not supposed to be a competition.  I think it's great that OP has had a chance to bond with her biological mother. She has not made.this decision lightly and maybe if stepmum gets over herself, she can feel special in other ways as the father of the bride's wife.", "NTA. You do as you wish at your wedding. Anyone who makes a stink about their role in someone else wedding just screams arrogance, and entitlement to me.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding. You get to decide who you want to participate. \n\nYour step mother is wrong for expecting to have the duties of someone she is not. Step parents are ridiculously entitled in most cases. You are kind enough already to invite her.  After her unnecessary reaction, I would\u2019ve removed her from the guest list. Lol. She\u2019s the asshole", "YTA. Your stepmother did all the heavy lifting, and this is how she is repaid?", "NTA. It almost sounds like your step mom wants to replace your real mother. Not to mention it\u2019s your wedding.", "NTA\n\nYour relationship with your stepmom is different than she thinks, and she needs to accept and understand that.  It just is.  People don't always form perfect bonds and you aren't required too either.  I get that she wants to be involved and that she is hurt, but it's not like you are asking her to not be involved.\n\nThe thing is this is for you and what you want.  If your relationship with her is different for you than that is OK and she needs to respect that.  This is something very personal for people and it's about them, no one else.  This isn't about her, it's about you.\n\nShe may have thought you had a different relationship and that's no ones fault,This is your special day.  It's about you and no one else. She can be there, she can be present and be a part of it, but ultimately that is NOT her role at all, and she doesn't get to inject herself.\n\nYour boundaries are your own and in the end time will dictate the relationship you have with her going forward. This marriage is for you and what you do now as an adult is your path.  She is also an adult.  It may be disappointing but in the end you want to be with your bio mom and that is not wrong to do.\n\nYou said No.\n\nThere is no more argument here.  Compromise, tell her you want her there.  Your bio mom missed out on a lot of experiences.  Let your bio Mom have this one thing.\n\nI would hope your stepmom is empathetic from your point of you because right now it seems like it is more about her and not you.", "b", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, afterwards their mind changed and my mom decided she did want to have a baby, so I came along. Being a new mom turned out to be really hard for her, and my dad worked full time so he wasn't really around all that much. When I was 1 they ended up divorcing. Mom did send me cards and gifts on birthdays and holidays. I'll admit we didn't have a great bond during my childhood, but have a strong relationship now and we've been in regular contact for the past few years.\n\nDad remarried when I was 7 and I had a half sister. My stepmom is a kind woman, don't get me wrong, and we do get along well - but she's not my bio mom.\n\nI'm getting married later this year. Dad will walk me down the aisle and my stepmom is of course a guest, but she's not going to be doing the \"mother of the bride\" duties. It's not really that much, just greeting guests, hanging around with me when I'm getting ready and giving a speech. I would like my mom to do that, and she's been really excited about it.\n\nNow the issue at hand is my stepmom is very upset. She told me she thought I would ask her, and I explained everything to her as best as I could but she's still acting kind of upset.\n\nMy dad is also saying I can do what I want, but it's not the right thing and I'm being hurtful.\n\nI've got people telling me all sorts of things but I don't think I'm in the wrong here. So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH. This one is really hard and I can somewhat understand everyone\u2019s perspective.\n\nI\u2019d be heartbroken if I\u2019d raised a kid from a young age and treated her like my child, just for her to turn around and treat me like \u201cany other guest\u201d on her wedding day. \n\nI can somewhat-ish understand your mom, although I don\u2019t personally agree with her actions. Raising an adult child is much easier than raising a child from infancy to the teenage years. I know how I\u2019d personally respond to my mom if she left me as a child only to magically reappear when I\u2019m grown\u2026 but if your relationship is strong and happy now, then good for you guys! At least she\u2019s making an effort now.\n\nAlso I think it\u2019s important to note that people view familial ties in very different ways (\u201cblood thicker than water\u201d or \u201cfound family\u201d and all that jazz) so, for some, blood ties are stronger than built relationships with stepparents. That\u2019s not my personal stance but I can understand it.\n\nIt is your wedding day so, ultimately, you do have the final say. Is there a place for her in the bridal party maybe? Or could you allow her to do a speech if she cares to? \n\nI heavily, heavily recommend sitting down with your stepmom and maybe finding some way to include her in your bridal party, even if it\u2019s just something small. It\u2019s clear that she loves you and she dedicated a lot of her life raising you when your bio mom wasn\u2019t there. I would never say you OWE her anything, but a wedding is a once in a lifetime thing for many people. All she probably wants is to feel involved in your special day and to be more than \u201cjust a guest\u201d. Grant her that if you can. Make her feel appreciated. And happy wedding day when it comes!", "Slight YTA \n\nFind a way to honor and include them both. My older daughter got married and her step mother and even ones of the future mother-in-laws were in the dressing room for photos. Stepmom, the other mother-in-law and I all went dress shopping too. As mom who was present in raising her and not simply a gift giver, I was a 100% fine with this. These are the women in my daughter's life that are important to her and care about her.", "NAH. But to echo other comments\u2026 your stepmom did the hard work raising you and it sounds like your relationship with bio mom blossomed once you were an adult. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to include stepmom in the wedding in a special way to recognize her commitment to you.", "Why cant you have 2 mother of the bride?  That is what my friend did and no one got upset and every one had fun.", "Y T A. You could have included them both. Your choice will affect your relationship with your step mom and your dad. Good luck with that.", "Why not both?", "YTA.  I feel so bad for your step mom. Her kindness was clearly wasted.", "If your father acted like your bio mom did, society would call him a deadbeat - but since it's your mom everyone has to clap and say how brave she was, and how hard it was for her. What a joke.\n\nNot going to call you an asshole, but I would not have made the same choices.", "> greeting guests\n\nLike a host? Like she\u2019s a parent who raised you.\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, but still YTA. It looks very much like you are taking the \u201ckind woman\u201d that is your stepmother for granted, so that you can give a place of prominence to someone about whom the best thing you can say about your strong relationship is that you\u2019re now in regular contact. You\u2019re pushing out someone who was there for you as a child, the one whose love you\u2019re more secure in, in an effort to get the approval of the one whose place in your life is a lot more unreliable.\n\nAnd \u201cgiving a speech\u201d \u2014 what is this woman really able to say about you and your progress as a person? That she remembers sending you birthday cards?", "Personally I think YTA hugely after reading why your stepmom isn\u2019t as involved. While it\u2019s great that you and your bio mom have a better relationship now than growing up, your stepmom stepped up and helped raise you, presumably like her own child, while you bio mom was around for a long bit of time. You\u2019ve said yourself that you\u2019ve only had a great relationship with her the last few years, while your stepmom and you have had a good relationship for 20+ years! Now you\u2019re leaving her out in the lurch because your mom doesn\u2019t like her??!! That\u2019s pretty fucked up and very heartless and cruel in my opinion. Yes, it\u2019s your wedding and you can choose to plan it however you want but I really don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking into consideration how hurtful this is to your step mom who raised you when bio mom was absent!! It\u2019s disrespectful and disappointing to let you mom dictate your wedding when she\u2019s only been back in your life for a few years. You\u2019re going to ruin the relationship with your stepmom and dad over a woman who was absent most of your life. If your bio mom truly wants to be involved in both your wedding and your life, she\u2019ll understand that your stepmom is who is to you and should absolutely be involved in the same aspect as bio mom. And if she doesn\u2019t, then bio mom is more selfish than I thought!", "I don't understand why people give so much priority to people who have abandoned them as kids.  Mom wants a relationship now, that's great, but let me just burn some bridges along the way.", "YTA", "YTA, and more so with every comment. \n\nAlso seems obvious that you're prioritizing the feelings of your deadbeat bio-mom because she's abandoned you before and you know she could do it again. Maybe something to work on in therapy?", "Sounds like the apple did not fall far from the tree.", "YTA imagine choosing the person who ABANDONED you over the person who CHOSE you.", "YTA, yea it's your wedding your choice ultimately... but it seems like stepmom was a much larger part of your life than your bio mom, but magically because you know she's your bio mom she still just wins out, there's probably nothing your stepmom could do to change that.  \n\nYou will hurt your stepmom, it is your choice to do so, but it's not exactly a great choice.", "So you *exist* because a woman who couldn't resist having a baby *also* couldn't resist running away and abandoning that baby, and you're cooler with that huss than the woman who raised you?\n\nYour dad has a point. This just seems wackadoo.", "Yta. Your mom only decided she warned to be a mom once you were an adult. It's your choice because it's your wedding, but yes, it's an asshole move if your stepmother treated you like her own.", "YTA.  Why does it have to be either or?  Your stepmom was not the usual Reddit monster SM - she was there for you and helped raise you - unlike bio mom who bailed.  It's great that you've reconnected with bio mom but that doesn't mean that stepmom should be shut out.  Surely there is enough going on in your wedding that both can share in the experience of being \"mother of the bride\".", "This was my question as well.\n\nIf it\u2019s just greeting guests, and being around you while you get ready.\n\nIt seems more like your intentionally leaving her out of things that could include multiple people.", "My mom and stepmom don't really get along, and my mom doesn't want her to be around. I don't want her (mom) to feel like I'm not prioritizing her.", "She send letters and gifts and all that when I was a kid, and would take me out for trips. Then when I was around 10-11 because she was in a tough position and in an abusive relationship, she couldn't make the time, but we got back in contact when I finished college", "Thank you!! Completely agree. \n\nThey can both something important in the big day. Stepmom shouldn't be thrown away just because bio mom decides to be a mom when op is all grown up and it's easy. Stepmom had a lot of hard years to help raise her  between 7 and now, and should be recognized for that.  Unless the relationship with Stepmom was a bad one, but all it says about that here is that she isn't Biomom. \n\nYTA  you have two women that love you and want to support you on this important day, don't throw one away when they don't deserve it.", "I thought I was insane by seeing the N-T-A comments\ud83d\udc80 \nYes she is not obligated to do anything in general but that doesn't mean she is not an asshole.. OP doesn't mention when exactly the bio mom was back...  If she was back since the Last few years that means OP was in 20s and so step mom did all the hard work and suddenly bio mom comes back and take all the credit of being the \"mom\" ?? Smh", "Yeah no, lol. \n\nA step mother is no different from a guest, lol. OP has a mother. OP isn\u2019t obligated to have her step mother \u2018in her heart\u2019 more than her bio mother if she doesn\u2019t want to\u2026. \n\nHow odd to dictate who should be more important to someone\u2026.especially a step parent\u2026", "This. Op it sounds like your step mom stepped up and was a mom to you while your bio mom tapped out. Now that you're grown up and you can do stuff together without the hard work and responsibilities, she's back. Hard to say since it's your life and your wedding but if I were step mom I'd take this as goodbye and no thanks for all the fish.\n\nETA.

What about Matron of Honor?", "YES!!!!!!!!!\n\nI think her reaction says a whole lot.  Sometimes people just don't develop bonds and that's cool.  Don't have to hate on them for that.", "Yeah she just did the bio mom's job for Most of OPs life.  Guess it is only right that the bio mom gets to do the fun stuff now that she is raised.  I mean she did send cards so I guess that makes everything all right.", "Agreed. Bio Mom missed out on a lot and I don't think bio mom should be excluded.  They want to build something now.  I think bio mom should have this one thing, she didn't get a whole lot and I bet it would mean a lot to her.", "Ditto", "Right!  I got that same vibe.", "That\u2019s too deep. It sounds like the step mom doesn\u2019t want to be just another guest", "This is... a take. Bio mom missed out on a lot of experiences? Yeah, and who's fault was that? Why did she abandon her daughter, but walk back in when said daughter is a fully grown adult to do all the fun activities (like having such a prominent role in her wedding)?\n\nBio mom can be a part of the wedding, sure. So can step mom. But no, OP doesn't want to do that, because according to her comment, bio mom doesn't like step mom and OP doesn't want bio mom to feel like she's not prioritizing her. What the fuck sort of logic is that?\n\nThis is really what OP's doing:\n\n1. Bio mom walks out\n2. Dad remarries\n3.

OP also says, in another comment, her bio mom sent cards until she was 10, then went MIA, and came back when OP was out of college\n4. Bio mom walks back in when said child is an adult\n5.

I do respect her and all that, and she was a good role model and parental figure to me growing up.\n\nBut my bio mom is my bio mom, we're closer now. I don't think the past should matter. Not to mention bio mom and stepmom don't get along that well.", "Your mom shouldn't really get to dictate that though. She's there to support YOU and it's kind and gracious of you to include her (and not so much to exclude your step mom).

My cousin gave up one of her kids because she could literally not take care of all four of them on her own.\n\nShe gave her son up for adoption, got better and became a part of his life.  \n\nThat is not f8cking wrong.\n\nMy stepdad raised me.\n\nI hate his guts.\n\nRelationships are fluid.", "Yeah and that makes her an AH", "The stepmom isn't trying to control the thoughts and feelings. And why are the biomass feelings more important than the stepmom? Bio mom was never a mom. She dumped her at 1 and sent gifts here and there maybe took around a trip here and there, but couldn't bother to raise her own child. That's not a mom, op is sitting here hoping to have a relationship with her biological mother that her half siblings have. Oh, and again to half siblings get some part of the wedding, but again, not the woman who actually raised her?? The only reason the stepmom is not involved is because bio mom doesn't want her to be. OP even said she's prioritizing her bio mom.This wedding isn't about prioritizing bio mom. The priority is the bride, so biomom needs to get over it.", "Where did I say she should hate her bio mom? I don\u2019t think she should, I support forgiveness if her mom actually apologized. Forgiveness does not mean forsaking the one who was actually there for her though. She\u2019s treating her stepmom as less than for a woman who frankly didn\u2019t give a shit about her for a large portion of her life. \n\nSure, they\u2019re are a million reasons to walk away but none of them are justifiable. If you make the choice to create a life, you are responsible for that life\u2019s", "What isn\u2019t \u201chonourable\u201d is then making an issue so you get the wedding and the woman who actually raised your kid gets booted because you don\u2019t like her", "OP literally said she just wasn\u2019t up for parenting and other than a stint with an abusive partner when op was 10-11 \u2014 yea, bio mom bailed. And the fact she didn\u2019t truly come back until OP finished college while raising other kids \u2014 bio mom doesn\u2019t deserve a reward for doing less than bare minimum. \n\nAnd on that note, why should stepmom just be thrown to the side when she DID DO the work?", "She didn't have any of that.. bio mom raised her other kids .. she even has Half siblings from the bio mom's side as Bridesmaids  \n\nNothing was \"hOnoRaBle\" about bio mom lol..", "No one is hating on bio mom (or if they are, they shouldn't be because like you said there are things that could have been out of bio moms control) but bio mom went MIA for 8+ years, after already minimally being in OP's life. Step mom was there for all the highs and lows of raising a child. For OP to essentially push step mom to the side to pull bio mom in is definitely a slap in the face to step mom for all the love and care she provided to OP.", "You are just wrong lol", "And the bride chose bio mom to perform the mom duties at the wedding. So yeah, everyone does indeed need to get over it.\n\nThis isn't a debate on how shitty bio mom is or how wonderful step-mom is. It's about OP's decision to include her bio mom. It doesn't matter the reason, choosing to have her bio mom doesn't make her an AH and dad and step-mom acting entitled and guilting OP over their decision does make them an AH. The argument of who's a better mom and who deserves it is petty, and that's aside from it being completely moot to the actual situation.", "None of them are justifiable!  Really!  \n\nOK so some mom got addicted to booze or drugs because that's reality, who knows for sure, but who can't take care of their kid, so she decides that she has to make a tough decision to get help and get better, and so since OP doesn't have a \"close\" relationship with Mom, we should just say, hell no, bio mom gets sh8t because reasons.", "Dude I have three mental illnesses and almost ended up in the hospital.  All you do is hate on this woman for trying to do right.  That's messed up.  \n\nShe owned it and got better, now OP wants a relationship.  It's called forgiveness.\n\nMy stepdad raised me.\n\nI hate his guts.", "Dude you assume that anyone who has addiction, struggles, has any kind of problem should just suck it up.  Really?  \n\nMy cousin gave up her son for adoption because she was poor and sick and it was the best decision she made.  She didn't want to abandon her kids!  She literally had no choice.  \n\nHer son is doing pretty great these days.  Better than ever and better for it.", "SO?  Life happens, it's fluid.  Should we just hate on her now for never changing?  Yeah no.", "Whelp I guess that is what people say when they lose.  Your thought process lacks critical thinking.", "It's actually not moot because the duties of the mother of the bride go to those who are entitled to them. It goes to the person who has been the mother to the bride. It is a complete and total slap in the face to the father and the stepmother. The fact that op is giving no bone to the stepmother by giving everything to her bio mom and her other children, oh the children she could handle raising. Op It's literally only doing this because it's what her biomass wants. It's not about what bio mom wants. What does it say about the bio mom that she can't suck it up and let the stepmother be there for the dresses or a toast? OP is chasing something that will never be.\n\nLet's be honest OP will never allow the stepmother to be called grandma or grammy or anything like that because it may upset her bio mom who may or may not actually be in her life.", "Yes, really! Those reasons are abandoning her child. You\u2019re making up a scenario that does not apply here. The mom dipped because parenting was hard and it wasn\u2019t for her. That isn\u2019t justifiable.", "But OP doesn\u2019t hate her stepmother. And you have mental illnesses. Okay? It has no bearing on this bio mother when Op has said nowhere (at this point) that she has a mental illness only that she didn\u2019t want a kid, decided she wanted one, and then left when it wasn\u2019t what she thought it would be. Yea she came back. AFTER THE MOTHERING WAS DONE. OP having a relationship with her isn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s that she is throwing her stepmom, the woman who did all the hard work, to the side because bio mom might not feel like a priority. You know \u2014 because bio mom made OP a priority all those years /s. And my answer would be completely different if stepmom had treated Op like shit and treated her as second best. But Op has already said that\u2019s not the case.", "Good for your cousin. Would she try to find that kid and tell them not to include their adoptive mother in their wedding. Because that\u2019s what OP\u2019s bio mom is doing.", "Again op's mom didn't really struggle from any addiction.. she was the one who decided to not have kids and then again after birth she decided to Abandon her kid And that makes her an AH.. and this story is not even remotely similar to your cousin's story.. if I somehow sympathize with the bio mom .. what about the step mom?? And what about her struggles and her feelings?? Oh she should \"suck it up\" cause she's an adult? Why can OP 's bio mom suck it up cause she is an adult too", "Nowhere does it say why her mom left, definitely doesn\u2019t mention a disability. Her mom comes back after the hard work is done and tells OP she doesn\u2019t want step-mom in the wedding. This sounds like a bitter, vindictive person and not an honorable one. You are wrong.", "What the f8ck.  You don't know that!  You have no idea what the circumstances were.  You just assumed she was a b8tch and doesn't want to change.", "You don't get to dictate the relationships of others.  You don't get to assume you know the conditions behind that choice and the circumstances.  Mental health is a means to an end!  It's called analogy.\n\nPeople are allowed to not like each other and no one is forced to have a relationship they don't feel comfortable with.\n\nOP doesn't even have to ask her, because that relationship is her choice.\n\nI hate my stepdad's guts.\n\nYeah he raised me.\n\nWe have no idea what the entire dynamics of this is, only what is said.", "If she did, adopted mom would respect it, because she's empathetic and understanding.  Adopted mom cares for my cousin and if he said I want my real mom, she would say OK I respect that and support him.  Because she respects his boundaries and the type of relationship they have."]}
