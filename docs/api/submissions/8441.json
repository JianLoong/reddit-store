The spelling is the one on their birth certificate, domenico and dominic, guilia and julia are 2 different people.\n\nAsk her nicely then every time remind her oh are you talking about [name]? I wasn't sure", "NTA, but this is more of a mixed bag. I use two different versions of my name, one translated one not, and to me there's the same name. For example think Matthew in English and Mateusz in Polish. It would be weird for me to be called Matthew in Polish, and vice versa. Technically 'Mateusz' is on my birth certificate but anyone calling me that in English is using a nickname as far as I'm concerned.\n\nNow, I understand that especially in diaspora communities, there's a lot of people that feel there's One True Name, the one that's on the birth certificate, that can't be translated, instead of the translated version being essentially the same. I don't experience it this way, but some do. I just wanted to write this because as someone with a bicultural background, I agree with your sister's perspective, and yours is not universal.\n\nHowever, you're the parent and she should respect your wishes. Hence NTA.", "WNBTA, She's changing their names based on her own preference and you should tell her to knock it off. If she doesn't take it well maybe explain your reasoning but that's very much like someone continually calling someone by the wrong name or an unliked nickname as like a power move or not caring enough to remember.", "NTA. I wouldn't even approach it as a language thing (even though it might be), just a spelling thing. \n\nIf you named your kid Suzi and she kept spelling it Susie, that's not her name.", "NTA - You should bring this up before your kids have. I\u2019m mixed race and my grandmother on my moms side always spelt my name wrong and I had to correct her she was doing it on purpose and I love her but resent that to this day.\n\nIt\u2019s tough enough finding your own way when you\u2019re a mix of cultures the people close to you don\u2019t need to make it any harder.", "NTA\n\nTranslate her name to the English version and teach it to your kids if she refuses to stop. If she is going to refuse to respect your choice of names for your kids, then she will have nothing to complain about when it's throw back at her.", "NTA - You children's names are their names with the spelling in which you gave them. She should use the spelling that you have given your children. I would correct her.", "NTA\n\nI don't know that it sounds like your sister necessarily has bad intentions, but those aren't their names. Simple as. She might be trying to do a sort of fun thing like how my old Spanish teacher gave every student a Spanish name, and later on in college my Chinese professor gave us all Mandarin names. There's no harm in that, but you're also free to dislike it and ask her to just call your kids by their names. Especially since it sounds like you did a really fun/neat thing by sort of blending your and your husband's native languages!", "INFO: Is this just transliteration? When you say 'a couple of different letters' do you mean, e.g., Cyrillic? Or the accented c in Croatian instead of 'ch'?\n\nNTA for asking her to use their actual names. Just don't be an AH in your tone or wording.\n\nBut NAH for changing to the alphabet of the language she's writing in (Cyrillic, for example) because that's done for lots of words and names. I wouldn't consider that disrespectful because that's the keyboard/alphabet being used, and there are clear rules for the 'translation' (actually transliteration).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She probably thinks she is being respectful of their names by using the native spelling. I don't think you'd be the asshole to ask her not to, but at this point it doesn't seem like she's being an ass about it.", "Info: is there a grammatical issue, like noun declension, when writing names in your native language?", "NTA \nHave a talk with her first. Tell her their names. \n\nIf she continues: \nStart telling her you don\u2019t know anybody with that name so you can\u2019t help her. \n\nIf she mails cards, return to sender as no such person lives there.", "Nta your sister should stop trying to translate their names because that's not their name and she should respect their actual names.", "NTA - but, and I'm sure I'm going to get downvoted for this because everyone loves outrage, but is this really worth your effort?  I mean if it means a lot to you you WNBTA if you addressed it, I don't get it, but my opinion doesn't really matter.  I guess I'm just lazy when it comes to interpersonal conflict.", "NTA but ti be honest the name choice may have been misguided. \n\nThe burden of their names is one that they will have to carry their entire lives.\n\nBoth me (m) and my sister and I have names that are somewhat less common and often mispronounced, misspelled, and misgendered. \n\nAfter decades of dealing with dramas over our names, neither of us would ever recommend using an unusual name and/ or spelling.", "I would go the petty route if talking doesn't work. Start spelling and pronouncing her name wrong. When she points it out say \"ya, it is disrespectful when someone deliberately gets your name wrong\"\n\nSigned as someone who faces this issue\n\nEdited for tense", "Yes NTA a person should respect the names, including the spelling that the child is given. She should definitely be corrected for the wrong spelling", "I am Polish too, but in our case, the difference is more like Alexander vs. Aleksander or Veronica vs. Weronika. I don't force my family to use English pronunciation. Actually, we wanted something that sounds pretty similar in Polish and English. The only issue for me is the spelling.", "Agree.  Any name misspelling, for any reason, should be corrected.\nNTA.", "Yeah, I thought of starting to translate her children's names to see how she reacts :)", "Yeah but the foreign language class names are part of the experience. We chose our own names both in school and language camp", "I mean just different letters e.g. Veronica vs. Weronika or Alexander vs. Aleksander (not actual names). They sound very similar but they spell differently", "There is a noun declension in my language, but you can apply it to names with English spelling. I normally do that when I write about my kids.", "That's exactly what we tried to avoid. My name was always very difficult to pronounce for anybody who is not from my home country. We gave our children classic English names that have their equivalents in many languages. My family (especially my mum who doesn't speak English) is able to pronounce their names. We have no intention to live in my home country. Thus, we prefer English spelling that is internationally recognised.", "Yeah I mean with spelling, it can be kinda weird in Polish, like 'co u Veronici', 'czy on jest z Veronic\u0105' look a little odd. If it bothers you tell her, but I'm not sure it's worth making too big a thing out of.\n\nAsk her if she would spell James as D\u017cejms and see what she says :)", "Dang, I never got to choose my own name for these things! Lucky", "You are NTA but consider being flexible on this.    Examine why this bothers you!   \n\nYou have created a multicultural family \u2014 and I am sure you\u2019ve thought about how to incorporate both sides of your kids\u2019 heritage into their upbringing.    Having access to Polish relatives and the Polish language is a wonderful gift and maybe their \u201cPolish names\u201d could be part of that.    Or not \u2014 maybe they could just be nicknames their aunt uses.   Or maybe your kids will get older and decide for themselves what they\u2019d like to be called.   \n\nAnyway, I think it\u2019s a way for your sister to connect with you over your shared heritage.   \n\nSource:   I\u2019m Ukrainian married to an American.  We chose names for our kids that translate well into both languages but we usually use the Anglo version of names (and it\u2019s what\u2019s on the birth certificate).    But I intentionally chose classic names that translate well so that our kids could choose, or access both cultures, or use Cyrillic versions of names with relatives & traveling abroad.", "Ok - now I understand!", "Weird that they'd impose a name on you.\n\nI went to Concordia Language Villages Russian camp a million years ago and one of the counselors was a retired military linguist who worked on the Klingon Dictionary", "NTA", "NTA Time to give info on who she asks about- i.e. strangers you know nothing about.

When she says your children you can tell her no my children aren\u2019t named That.", "For some reason, it pisses me off a lot", "And then translate her name into English after several warnings. Or just give her a ye olden times English name if she doesn't stop.", "Then yea, do something about it.  It's not like it's going to hurt your sister to write your kids names correctly.  And it is a respect thing.", "OMG that's so awesome! Maybe cooler for a Trek fan (like myself) but still! Did they teach you any words?", "I was struggling with Russian so no. Yeah, I threw it out there because I could get coolness by proxy.", "Find an 'international' version of her name, and start calling her that name, or all of them.

While I do admit it's annoying trying to remember if people in my life spell their names as Rebekah or Rebecca, John or Jon, Bradley or Bradleigh (yes, I live in Utah), that person still deserves the respect of their name being spelled the way it was given.", "NTA\n\nYour children's names are what mom and dad agreed on and had put on their birth certificate. She should honor that. She is definitely the one in the wrong. Maybe you should translate her name to English and call her by that until she stops changing your children's name to her choice.", "NTA. You ask her and then when she keeps doing it take a red pen, scratch out the incorrect names, then send it back with a note saying you corrected her errors. Shes an english teacher,  that should drive her insane.", "Nta. I have one of those names that has several spellings. I hate when people spell it wrong. Especially family. My aunts have never in 40 years bothered to learn which way (think Sarah vs Sara\u2026 it\u2019s not a huge or odd difference).  It\u2019s insulting and stings a bit that I don\u2019t matter enough to learn my name.", "Exactly. I would just politely point out that it\u2019s Suzi. Be polite and consistent and she will get tired of it eventually.", "She will likely just get pissed if you try to correct her. She obvviously thinks she is the one that knows best!", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking that she spell it a certain way. But as someone with family who are in a different country that spells my name differently, I liked that they spelled it their way since it emphasized my other culture. It made me feel included. I never felt confused as to how to spell it in school, it was sort of like a special family nickname. Just food for thought.", "Genuine questions: is she aware that their names are officially spelled different? And that switching letters bothers you? Does it bother your kids?", "I\u2019m Polish too, and I did the same when naming my daughter. It drives me NUTS when my mum misspells it. \nNTA.", "It would piss me off too. People complained about my daughter's name being different.  My dad called her by the wrong name the first couple of weeks but that was because his hearing was bad and he didn't realize her name was Isa, not Lisa.  Once I told him it was like Lisa without the L, he corrected it right away. Seems like that isn't sister's problem since she teaches English, but it could be she looks at using the more ethnic names as showing more affection.", "Does it bother you if other relatives who don\u2019t speak English write them in their local form?", "this is a wonderful answer and I apologise for not having reddit gold for you because this answer is worth one of those red boxes around it \ud83d\udfe5"]}
