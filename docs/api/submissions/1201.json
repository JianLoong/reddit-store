We've been together since my junior year of high school. I graduated during covid when my boyfriend was in his freshman year of college. He left school due to a terrible transition by the school into online learning seemingly 'for a semester'. He cried to me about how he thought everyone was going to be disappointed and think he was a failure. I told him I didn't like it but it wasn't my decision. That was almost 3.5 years ago now. He got a new job at a retail market, now he has a full-time kind of management position but he hates it most days. I was in college my senior year of high school, got my AA a semester after finishing, and am currently at a local university getting my bachelors and plan to get my masters in lucrative field. Both of us live with our respective parents to save money, I pay rent he doesn't. \n\nSituation: I've mentioned going back to school for him multiple times over the almost 4 years. He just sits and gets disinterested or upset. He says it's too expensive (I have scholarships to pay for mine and he no longer does) which I understand but he hasn't tried to apply for any scholarships or save up money. He even just bought an expensive new car.  He then says he doesn't know what he'd go for. He'll frequently mention 'Not knowing what he wants to do' but when I mention he can get a  Gen Ed Associates to see if he wants anything and can do it cheaply on his own time he doesn't seem to care so the conversation ends. He also randomly says he wants to do things like maybe a small plane pilot or police officer or teacher and I try to encourage his wants so I'll offer to help him look up the process and get started even if that means going back to school. But he just continues to shut me down about it. \n\nI think im the asshole for continuing to bring it up, but all he does is work, come home and play video games, sleep then work again and expects sex out of me basically anytime we're alone. We've mentioned getting married later on and I just don't see him with any sort of motivation or long term commitment to anything unless it involves sex or a Playstation.\n\n  If we are going to be long term and end up married, shouldn't I be with someone who has the same type of drive I do? The effort from him lately is minimal and I think he's depressed but he won't see a therapist either.

It\u2019s not your job to fix another human being or wait around until they grow up.  NTA but honestly your boyfriend isn\u2019t really an AH. He\u2019s got a full time job & he doesn\u2019t know how to get started in the world. That\u2019s pretty common, but it\u2019s not a match for what you want.", "NAH, but you're probably not compatible and I don't think either of you are at fault. Plenty of people didn't know what they wanted to do with their lives at age 20 (and tbh, there's a decent chance that you don't either. I have a Masters and am on my 3rd career. People change. Life happens)", "NTA....but I think you've grown up where he hasn't grown as much. You are expecting that he wants more out of life than he's getting, you are projecting a bit on him, while he may be depressed if he doesn't pursue changing his situation there is nothing you can do.", "You can\u2019t make him into what you want. He\u2019s not a doll. That makes YTA. It sounds like you know what you want to do (leave him). Your not a doll at his beck and call either. If you don\u2019t want to get it on that\u2019s perfectly fine. It sounds like you guys are incompatible on a multitude of levels and if you\u2019ve talked about marriage and don\u2019t want to bc if his issues...why are you still with him? Seriously.", "NTA for wanting \"the best\" for your boyfriend, but you are clearly not on the same page on what that means. You see that as him going back to school, but he seems to believe otherwise.\n\nI think you need to face the reality that you guys met young (around 15/16 if my math is correct) and have now grown apart. Although, it does seem like you already have that in mind, given your comment, and that you are just looking for confirmation/support.\n\n>If we are going to be long term and end up married, shouldn't I be with someone who has the same type of drive I do?\n\nThat said, maybe r/relationship_advice could give better insight.", "He's definitely depressed- not on you to fix. Maybe provide him some resources on how to get into trade jobs if he doesn't want to accumulate debt or go back to traditional schooling ad avenues to get therapy or something- but its on him to actually address his mental health and get the drive to do something. I'd say have a conversation around your concerns for his mental health, that you want to support him, but you don't want to be enabling him to not work on himself.+\n\nETA judgement- NTA", "NTA- it looks like he\u2019s comfortable where he is for now and still in the finding himself phase. The key here is communication. Sit down with him (in a public place) and talk About future goals -marriage, home and kids/pets. Talk\nAbout financial goals and loose time lines - like in 5 years you want to have a down payment on a home\u2026and see where he\u2019s at. When I was younger just being with someone glossed over a lot in a relationship and I lost years waiting. I even went into debt funding failed ventures. If your not on the same page, move on.", "NAH. Cut bait. You are both on different paths in life right now. You seem more focused on the future and long term goals and it sounds like he is drifting through life at the moment.", "YTA. He clearly is unmotivated to go back to school and has told you multiple times to stop talking about it. He also refuses to see a therapist. \n\nThe answer the the question \"How can I make someone do what I want them to?\" is \"you can't.\" Your boyfriend has \"told you who he is\" multiple times. You can either accept him the way he is now, without expectations that he will change, or decide you would prefer to be with someone with similar ambitions to you own.", "NAH. You\u2019re both just starting your adult lives and have different goals, interests, and drives. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to stick around, though. I know this isn\u2019t an advice sub, but you should consider moving on and allowing yourself to meet more likeminded people in the spaces where you\u2019re going to be. You\u2019re young! Enjoy the ride and good luck!", "YTA. I'm not sure what you want from him. It sounds like you don't have a problem with him paying his bills and that he has a management position. Saying something once is fine. But pushing it over and over is not.", "I\u2019m going with NAH. You make very good points about the future, but he doesn\u2019t know what he wants yet. And that\u2019s ok. He\u2019s right that it\u2019s pointless to spend all that money when he doesn\u2019t have any idea what he wants to do with his life. I\u2019m very glad that you\u2019ve got such a strong career path at such a young age, but not everyone has that. You can either choose to support him while he figures it out or you can decide that you want to be with someone with a clearer path.", "Soft YTA. You might want the best for him but he clearly doesn\u2019t want to do any of the things you\u2019re suggesting. Continuing to try and push him will just make things worse. This is a turning point. If his decisions don\u2019t match your ideals, you\u2019re on different paths and need to accept that. Maybe one day he\u2019ll regret not going back to school but you can\u2019t force him and you can\u2019t keep going on at him if he\u2019s not ready. You want different things so you either have to live with that or move on without him.", "I've shifted more from \"You should go back to school for that thing you now dislike\" to \"what would you want to do?\" And he'll offer careers and I offer to help  figure out how to get into them. He still seems half interested.  I know I can't make him. But you're right I'm more concerned for his mental health than his education and that's definitely a talk I'll have with him. Thank you for the advice.", "Hes never said to stop talking about it explicitly he just doesn't like too. It's obvious via body language.  It's not for me that I want him to go school either, sure I value an education and would love to be able to relate to each other but I mostly want him to go because he was motivated then, had more goals and  stuck too them. He would benefit from the education more than I would.", "Unfortunately enough, my last relationship was similar to this situation so definitely been there- on a note for your own mental health- if it gets to the point where his inability to address his mental health starts affecting your own mental health,it might be time to reevaluate the relationship. I spend two years trying to emotionally and financially support my ex to work on his physical/mental health and seek out training programs(he always talked about wanting to go into firefighting or policing) but he always just found something to blame as to why he couldn\u2019t, and actually ended up getting even less healthy because of the enabling I did. I eventually had to make the decision for me to walk away. I\u2019m not advocating you leave or make ultimatums or anything,just want to make the point that you shouldn\u2019t ever have to overextend yourself to your own detriment to help someone,even if it\u2019s someone you love and care for deeply.", "That doesn't change my response at all. You're pushing him to do something that he clearly doesn't want. \n\nIt's a mistake to date the imaginary person your boyfriend could be if he only applied himself. Either accept him the way he is, or move on.", "I'm responding for guidance because I appreciate this;\nUsually when we talk about it it's because he brought up a career path so I offer to help him look into it regardless if that means school or not as I've been thinking it's not fair to think the way I do of \"school or nothing\" when it comes to him.  I know he doesn't like his current job but he hasn't bothered to try any new ones. His job also offers full tuition up front for him. He's kind of listless and I don't know how to help other than to do this. I'm okay with being the AH in terms of your opinion but I'm asking so I can be better for him.", "I don't know how many *more* ways I can say \"either accept him the way he is, or move on.\"\n\nDo you prefer:\n\n* \"Break up with this unambitious, unmotivated, lazy guy! He's going to be an unbearable burden on you for the rest of your life!\" or\n* \"Leave him alone to be himself and find his own path in life! Don't interfere!\"?\n\nWhy are you doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results?\n\nYou might want the [Relationship Advice subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/)."]}
