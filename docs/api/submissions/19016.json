Absolutely no reason you should have applied the controls, with the information you had available.", "NTA. You made the right call. The only scenario this would be acceptable is if the adult child has a disability and is unable to safely live independently. A 30 year old woman who is paying her own phone bill should not have parental controls on it.

I wish there was a way you could warn the daughter.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't an AH situation, if the mother doesn't have those permissions then you are not able to do it without the proper authority and you did your job properly. Morally it was also the right thing to do as the daughter is an adult. It seems really weird and maybe there's more to the situation. Maybe the daughter has a disability of some sort etc.", "NTA.

The account was set up so the mother isn't authorized to modify the daughter's line. The daughter is paying for her own line.

Doesn't sound like there's any reason to make an exception. Might be worth checking on what the official policy is just to CYA in case someone pays attention to the complaint.\n\nWould recommend logging this in some way. At least send an email to your line manager, just to be safe.", "NTA\n\nPretty sure what this mother asked is illegal in more than one country.\n\nJust take record of what happened, in case the mother really fills a complaint, so you can explain yourself to your bosses (I doubt that she has ground for a complaint, but better be safe than sorry).", "Definitely NTA!\n\nAccording to you, you followed your company policy. End Of.  Pretty sure if the daughter realized that the control had been activated she might have been able to sue your company as it sounds like though they are on the one account, the daughter pays for her line - I'm not familiar with this setup but it sounds like it almost an autonomous account and the line is only on the account because it saves everyone some money?\n\nMorally I think you did the right thing as well.  The mum sounds like a controlling B***", "NTA", "NTA the kids paying for their own phone and personal usage and privacy. They are over 18. Would let a the sixty year old random man/woman put that on and 18 year olds phone? It would break a contract somewhere. It sound like it may not of been the other maybe an aunt or something. I know my aunt J for reference added herself to my lines without my consent. As I was over 18 and not will to let her take my phone that I paid for so she can try and control me. I reported it stolen and made everything public on Facebook. And made damn sure everyone new I was trying to get the hell away from abusive people. NTA", "NTA. The daughter\u2019s an adult, and your company doesn\u2019t allow this. Don\u2019t do it.\n\nIf you did it, you would be violating your company\u2019s policy, which would put your job at risk. In the USA you would be conspiring to violate the daughter\u2019s privacy, which could be a crime. It\u2019s certainly grounds for a restraining order against you, which will go into a database used by the police to track and enforce restraining orders. The restraining order would come up in a background check against you, such as when you apply for your next job after they fire you from this one.", "NTA.  I think the daughter owes you a trip to Disneyland or a really good German Weissbier.  I'd think about the Weissbier.

Surely what's relevant is you implement policy appropriately, gently and firmly.", "YTA.  As a retiree of a Telco this is either fake or you are about to lose your job.
