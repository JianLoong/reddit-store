I\u2019ve literally had to BEG for back massages to help ease the pain, and the few times im lucky enough to get one, it\u2019s only for about 5 minutes. Today he asked how I was feeling, and I told him I was in a lot of pain. His comment was \u201cwell you looked fine this morning\u201d. I\u2019m sick of having such an unsupportive partner in this pregnancy, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want him in the delivery room telling me \u201cI\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t hurt that bad\u201d.

You\u2019re going to head home still in pain and recovering, with a newborn baby in two who needs constant care. Your partner in that moment should be someone who will take on everything he possibly can to help you heal, with the baby, around the house, etc. Do you believe your partner is ready to be that person? If not, you might want to consider whether your Mom can come stay post partum or if you can stay with her, and long term, whether this is a marriage that\u2019s worth being in.", "NTA. It\u2019s not just that he hasn\u2019t been supportive, he\u2019s been actively **un**supportive throughout your pregnancy by invalidating your experience and basically accusing you of exaggerating your discomfort at every turn. You deserve to have someone in the delivery room who will take care of, reassure, and uplift you, and that hasn\u2019t been him recently.", "NTA - but be prepared to be raising that baby solo. I doubt he is going to be involved much with child rearing. You\u2019ll likely do all the clean up, feedings, diaper changing, baths, etc. I also would expect he\u2019ll be the type yell about how hard his day at work was if you even dare mention how tired you are from the delivery or caring for the baby.", "lmao if I said any of those things to my wife I would be a single dad right now (and rightfully so)", "There are two wolves inside of me:\n - the first says to kick him in the nuts and then tell him it's not that bad.\n - the second says that he can't be in the delivery room unless he becomes an empathetic and supportive partner.\n\nPart of me says, \"Why not both!\"", "NTA\n\nYou are completely justified in not wanting him there.

But be sure to communicate what a dick he is being, because as others have said, it will go beyond delivery. \n\nNot to concern you, but 14 hours of labour with 1 kid, 2 C-sections, mastitis and an abscess which exploded all on its own, the most painful thing of all for me was the early weeks of breastfeeding. I say this because I know for so many, even the majority, breastfeeding is a non-issue, but everyone experiences things differently. You don't question someone's pain, they know what they are going through, but your husband seems like the type of AH who could also think it can't be that bad because other women do it too.", "You need someone that will be supportive...\n\nNot dead weight\n\nNta", "NTA. \n\nBirthing a child is traumatic and painful, and that's before making it to the actual delivery part. You deserve someone who will comfort and calm you.\n\nI would rethink your relationship in general, though. I'm not a fan of \"just divorce\" for all problems, but how he treats you while growing a person is only a glimpse of how supportive he's going to be while healing and recovering. \n\nI'm dramatic over everything, but my husband never downplays anything I say, even though he knows my personality, he still goes above and beyond to take of me and make my life easier, as I do for him.\n\nHis behavior is reflective of how he loves, and there doesn't seem to be much compassion in the love he shows.", "Dad of 2 here. Please do not let him into the delivery room if he is so dismissive of your pain and it would put you in the wrong mindset. My wife says that you need to be as relaxed as possible during labor (obviously easier said than done, but even harder if someone is minimizing what\u2019s going on with your body).\n\nThe best advice we got before our first was born was this: you can never have enough helpful people around, but you can very quickly find yourself surrounded by too many unhelpful people. You get to set your own boundaries on the unhelpful people, even if (especially if) they\u2019re family. \n\nYour mom will be a much better support person by your side anyway.

My ex husband and I separated during my pregnancy and he was more supportive than your husband. Jesus", "NTA. Choose someone who will actually be supportive. You know your husband will not be. Having proper support in the birthing room can help move things along.", "NTA\n\nPeople who are with you during labor and delivery are meant to be SUPPORT people, in that they are there to support YOU.  Birth is not a spectator sport, and if someone isn't being supportive, then they don't belong there.  \n\nYou are also allowed to change your mind during labor.  Discuss this with your labor nurses when you're admitted.  They're practiced at enforcing whatever you want.", "NTA  you need a supportive partner in the room with you. Your hospital will keep him out because YOU are the patient, not him. If his presence doesn\u2019t put you at ease- he needs to stay out. Your blood pressure can rise and baby can go into distress\u2026 so his being there could actually be more harmful. Birth is not a spectator event, you need someone there for you- and he\u2019s shown that isn\u2019t him so far. Can you imagine his reaction to when you are in active labor\u2026 it\u2019s not that bad. \n\nIf he can\u2019t step up, you have to make choices best for you and baby. A good father doesn\u2019t belittle the baby\u2019s mother.", "NTA. \n\nYou may be saving his life because if the nurses get a hold of him if he's this unsympathetic it will be all over for him. Take your mom.", "NTA\n\nThey sell pregnancy simulation things because of this exact thing. Get one on Amazon and tell him he's gonna experience childbirth", "NTA \n\nIm sorry to hear that this is happening. Have you spoken to your midwife about your pain levels? Do you at least know the cause? \n\nNow your husband is being incredibly insensitive and unsupportive and that\u2019s not okay. He needs to work on that asap because you\u2019re going to need way more support once the baby is here and you\u2019re recovering. He\u2019s going to need to step up and support his wife who is in pain! His response to how could it possibly be that bad is just plain disrespectful. Someone you loved is telling you hey im in pain and your response is you were okay this morning? I would tempt with the idea of smacking him and asking does that hurt? Yes oh but it didn\u2019t hurt this morning. Okay don\u2019t condone violence but I\u2019m sorry your husband is being ridiculous.\n\nYou deserve someone to support you. It\u2019s scary to give birth and you need someone that will hold you hand, make you feel safe and tell you everything is going to be okay. I hope your husband can step up and become that person but if not well that\u2019s the consequences of HIS actions. Especially if you\u2019ve expressed as much, \n\nGood luck with the rest of your pregnancy and maybe you have a smooth delivery and recovery", "NTA.

I\u2019ll tell you what that turns into\u2026an unsupportive father.", "NTA its your birth your baby. Honestly though if you don't want him there then maybe that's a sign you should reconsider your relationship with him. Also, the fact that his treatment of you has been abusive also suggests you need to reconsider your relationship.\n\nLook, I know its the wrong time since you are about to have a baby and you'll need his help but I guarantee he'll be more a hindrance than a help with a young child. He sounds like a real wanker.", "Typically, I\u2019m on the side of the husband should be in the delivery room.\n\nThis time though, nope.

Please consider also hiring a birth doula to support & advocate for you. You deserve it.", "NTA. Your choice.\n\nMake sure you let him know that he has not been supportive and that is the main reason he is not in the delivery room. \n\nAnd, will he be supportive once this child is born.

This is a MASSIVE red flag OP, I would be reconsidering the whole relationship. If he\u2019s not capable of understanding your pain simply because he doesn\u2019t experience it, what else won\u2019t he listen to you about? This is fucked up. Id dump his ass but at the very least you get to decide how you want to give birth, regardless of the situation. You are the one putting your body through trauma, it is up to you and you only.", "You don\u2019t have a delivery room problem, you have a husband problem.

Also, may be time to reevaluate the relationship. Therapy, stat.

I'm so sorry.", "You would be completely justified if you didn\u2019t allow him in the delivery room, but that won\u2019t save you from him making a big stink about it for the rest of your life.

Your husband sounds very unsupportive of this journey and I am so sorry. Honestly, it sounds like his attitude is going to get worse after the baby comes. Don\u2019t let him in the delivery room and tell him exactly why. If I were you, I would lay it out straight. He steps up and supports you, or you are leaving.", "NTA it sucks that your husband has this outlook on your pain. People, even medical professionals, are dismissive of women's pain. Your husband being dismissive makes me wonder if he is dismissing only your pain, or generally discrediting all women. Honestly not sure which is worse and either way thats a mark of his character and outlook on gender. \n\nDo you like your doctor? Do you think this might be something they can attest to? And explain to him how painful a complicated pregnancy like yours is? If he doesn't truly come around to empathize with you, there will be a ton of resentment and also he will just keep dismissing and not helping and in fact actively making things worse for you. \n\nSorry, this is an awful problem to have when you're already pregnant.", "NTA\n\nThis requires an in-depth conversation ahead of time. You need to explain that he has invalidated and ridiculed your pain for months. You plan to scream bloody murder during labor and delivery and you are not tolerating any more of his shenanigans. \n\nHis choices are to sit outside and meet the baby after birth; or he can offer his genitals to hold instead of his hand and listen to you tell him \"Oh, it can't hurt that bad...\"", "NTA, I don't have to read farther than the title. Your birth, your body, your private parts on display (and hugely swollen etc)-- that means you choose who stays with you.", "I wouldn't let a partner who dismissed my pain, especially caused by a pregnancy he sure had a hand in, get near my bedroom. Honestly if possible I wouldn't let them near my house either. But definitely not in the delivery room where you need a room full of support. \n\nNTA. Your husband really needs to open his eyes", "NTA - BUT I had natural childbirth and my hubby let me \"hold\" his hand....I nearly broke it through the pain. He later stated that he didn't know how strong I was. \n\nHonestly, that would be a bad payback. Maybe have your mom as a primary and let your hubby watch from afar. I am sure he will get quite the visual education and maybe more appreciation?", "NTA- you need real help and support. If that means your mom, your sister, your friend, that\u2019s who you get. There is no room for a man not pulling his weight. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA- if he\u2019s not supporting you now he\u2019s not going to support you when the baby gets here.\n\nStart making an exit plan because you not allowing him In The delivery room is going to cause ww3", "NTA. Do not have another child with this man.", "NTA. \n\nSomehow I doubt this was the first time he\u2019s displayed being an unsympathetic/unsupportive partner but maybe this will open his eyes a bit.", "NTA and tell him why in detail. Don't have another pregnancy with him either.", "The nurses would put him in his place if he said something so stupid in the delivery room. Has he been with you to any OB appointments? Can your doctor tell him to stop being an ass and that IT REALLY IS that painful?", "No and you chose the wrong person too marry and have a baby with", "Currently 30 weeks pregnant, and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this! You\u2019re definitely NOT the asshole! People don\u2019t realize just how mentally and physically tolling pregnancy is. I\u2019d definitely bring it up to him how unsupportive he had been, there definitely needs to be a conversation. Giving birth is a traumatic event, no matter how smooth it goes, and you need someone on your team!! Hope it all goes well!", "Nta being asked if I was ok made it harder", "NTA. It sounds like he\u2019s not empathetic at all and doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through. \nI really don\u2019t think he\u2019s equipped to handle being a supportive partner in the delivery room and honestly by the sounds of it he might not want to be in there either. For example My dad went home, cleaned the whole house and came back and sat in the corner quietly but my mother had her friend in there the whole time who really helped her and coached her breathing etc. Some men really just can\u2019t or won\u2019t deal with it - although my dad was never outright unsympathetic. \n\nI\u2019d express that to him and if he\u2019s shocked reiterate that if he wants to be there his attitude needs to do a complete 180 and he needs to show you how much he cares and actually help you otherwise you will have your mother in there in with you instead.", "YWNBTA, tell him before though.

(I'm not a mom so I don't know about the magic of delivery and how emotional it is, but I have heard other couples talk about it and have read about it, and it sounds like something really really impactful and meaningful for couples and people to experience together.)

I'm sorry you r dealing with these emotional things on top of a difficult pregnancy. I hope things get much much easier for you.", "I'm seeing a lot of NTA votes here so I'll play devils advocate (not that I disagree with the others view).

She also said a lot of nice so not stuff, but that was ok cause she was pregnant right...? lol\n\nI guess my point is he doesn't know. He can't get pregnant. And while he should be more understanding, you should also, by not keeping him from being there when his child is born. \n\nEven when I said stuff I regretted to my wife, I didn't say anything in the room. We all get frustrated. It's not easy dealing with a pregnant woman either lol. I was just there holding her hand and telling her she was doing great. \n\nI seriously doubt he is going to say something like that with other women in the room (nurses, doctor). \n\nAlso, just because he is a bad husband, doesn't mean you have the right to keep him from his child. He has more of a right to be there than your mom. \n\nBut... if you REALLY think that he is going to cause you that much stress that it will risk the baby, and not just taking out your frustrations on him for his stupid words. Then you can keep him out of the room, but he still has the right to see his child right after, regardless of how you feel.\n\nIf you are just bitter you will regret not having him there.

You and your husband need to get into marriage counseling and you need to prepare yourself that you each may have very different love languages.  If there is a possibility that he is on the spectrum, he may view consoling as less valuable than solving.  Telling you that it doesn\u2019t seem that bad might be his way of comforting you.  It seems weird, but unless the two of you have had open and honest conversations about this while completely refraining from judgement, you can\u2019t really trust yourself to know how he feels about it.  He may also not enjoy back rubs, so isn\u2019t really aware of how much you might enjoy them.  \n\nThe problem here that may make you the AH is if you deny him access to his child\u2019s birth simply because the two of you have not engaged in mutually beneficial communication.", "YTA....

I\u2019ve literally had to BEG for back massages to help ease the pain, and the few times im lucky enough to get one, it\u2019s only for about 5 minutes. Today he asked how I was feeling, and I told him I was in a lot of pain. His comment was \u201cwell you looked fine this morning\u201d.

It is a major surgery, and if you're like me they give you fk all pain meds *here's a drip with some paracetamol in it* and you've to deal with your entire insides having been on the outsides and pushed back in quite hastily.

No, you can't.", "LMAOOOOOO\n\nHow do you expect him to learn how to be a parent if he keeps getting pushed away?", "I might have asked for.

I certainly don't expect any.", "If it needs an explanation then you are to adolescent to understand", "Lol, just cause I said a few mean things to my wife when she was pregnant doesn't mean I'm a bad husband / father, but you can go ahead and believe whatever you like. I'm guessing you aren't married or have kids. She was a different person the first trimester, said a lot of rude shit uncalled for shit, and I sometimes I responded to it. \n\nI was just providing context as to why this might be happening. Husbands are also doing a lot of work before and after the baby is born which is also stressful and can lead to people saying things they don't mean. I don't think that's a good reason for being there for the birth on also HIS child. \n\nShe might be able to keep him out of the birth room, which is an asshole move, but she would be within her rights.

The person who commented is out of their freaking mind (or a teenager) thinking that what you shared about your husband remotely sounds like he's more about problem-solving.\n\nMy husband is all about problem-solving. If I was bent in pain, problem-solving would look like running me a hot bath, asking if there's any medication I can take (I know you can't), giving me the freaking massage I'm asking for. Telling you you look fine doesn't qualify as problem-solving. Your husband is using you for his purposes (getting a child), in fact he's probably been using you for a long time. The fact he won't reciprocate acts of care like weekly  massages is very telling.", "Stop giving him massages if he can't be bothered to reciprocate.  And ignore that commenter, have your mom in the delivery room with you!  She'll take care of you, she'll support you.  Everyone in that room should be focused on doing what they can for the person in labor, if your husband can't be assed to do that, he doesn't belong in there.  Consider having your mom stay with you after delivery to help you recover, too (especially if you have a c section!) I'm worried your husband won't be any help.", "So why do you give him chest, back and head rubs if its not reciprocated? Use the same words back at him that he uses. Oh you looked fine this morning, last night, 5 mins ago. Oh it cant be as bad as growing an actual human being in your body as it x, y, z.\n\nYour problem is you enable him on a day to day basis.  He doesnt respect you, he cannot empathise, he doesnt reciprocate what you are doing. This isn't just about the delivery room. This is about your whole relationship, what you want it to look like, and how you are both going to raise the child. Because I bet you when you are exhausted, if you ever get ill - he'll be the same and tell you its nothing and because you fed the baby you must be fine despite you probably having no choice but to go through the most agonising pain and discomfort and still push through because your child has to be fed or changed or looked after etc", "You're absolutely right for that.", "They don't care, birth is just a unique spectator sport to them.", "All im saying is she cant make it better but she can sure make it worse.

I finally flipped one day asking him why he doesn't take anything I say seriously and he said something similar to this.

That long and hard conversation helped so much.", "That's understandable I'm glad you two were able to communicate where you were both coming from and what you needed! It can be hard to both acknowledge an emotion and also model remaining calm and not amplifying the other person's fear or pain. With my pets for instance if something falls and spooks them I'll say in a gentle excited voice \"did that make a big noise? Yeah, it's ok\" \n\nTbh I'm worried for when the baby comes. Plenty of childhood injuries an adult would see as \"not a big deal\" are also the most shocking and painful thing a kid has ever been through, even if it's just a bruise or a skinned knee - bc they just haven't been on the planet that long.

I have to remind him every so often that his response is not sympathetic and supportive and he doesnt know what I am feeling because I am experiencing my body, not him. He has gotten better but I still have to remind him. I guess its a male thing to be dismissive of and deny others' discomfort. What a sucky society that we live in that our men are taught to do that. Ugh.", "You need someone to support you. Is there any opportunity to stay with the mother now?", "I feel this but from the other end. My SO is not the calm one i am.

I'm not a parent but I'm pretty sure how you're reacting with your pets is pretty close to how you would react with a child. \n\nEspecially when they're younger, children will often look to their parents before crying because they're not sure how to react.

On the flip side, telling your kid who's clearly hurt or upset *\"You're fine. Calm down, get up.\"*  is probably teaching them to ignore their own feelings/pain, and not to expect support from that parent. \n\nReacting that way you do sounds like a good middle ground honestly! *\"That was a big fall! That's okay, we all fall!\"* and then let them form their own reaction, however that looks. \n\nAgain, I'm not a parent so I'm just imagining with my own future hypothetical child haha", "We used to do the \u2018Ouch, I bet that hurt.

I am some stranger on the internet. Who cares if I disagree with you or not. Your opinion is valid, but you gotta back it up.", "She\u2019s not keeping him out out of spite.
