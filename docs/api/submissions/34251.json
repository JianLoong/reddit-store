Currently she is an LPN for work, and she\u2019s in her mid 50s. She only cuts hair from her house now.\n\nI love her very much, but personally, I believe she has outdated hairstyling techniques. She seems to give very exact, bowl type cuts for men, and they tend to poof out on the sides as well. Whenever my fianc\u00e9 gets a haircut from his mom, I don\u2019t really like it, but he insists to \u201cnot hurt her feelings\u201d. I have swallowed my words for 4 years every haircut he gets, but my wedding is where I want to draw the line.\n\n I have had her cut my hair a couple of times, and the last time she cut my hair, I had her take length off. I am biracial and have curly hair, so I advised her to kind of leave more than she normally would for straight hair. \nI woke up the next morning and my hair was poofy as a poodle. I looked like Dora pretty much. It was shorter than chin length, and I wanted it to touch my shoulders. That was the first time I have ever received an undesirable haircut (my mother is also a hairdresser, mid 40s, and it is her main source of income) so it was very devastating for me. Took me a year to grow out all of the issues with the length, and my bangs also were cut very short, way shorter than desired. Ever since then, I am honestly traumatized and I don\u2019t let her cut my hair anymore. I never told her how I felt to spare her feelings, but I\u2019m sure she knows I don\u2019t want my hair cut by her anymore since it\u2019s been over a year since she did it last. \n\nTo add to this, his mother is very much a worry wart, and she seems very perfectionist, so often times she cuts more and more and more off your head because she wants it to look even. This type of thing worries me and is probably why I had such short hair after my last cut with her. \n\nEvery woman dreams of this day, and I want our wedding photos to be beautiful. I just want to see his hair in a more up-to-date hairstyle than I believe his mom can give him, at least for our wedding photos. It matters very much to me. \n\nAITA for requesting that my fianc\u00e9 goes to a younger, more up to date hairdresser before our wedding date? \nHe claims that it will hurt her feelings, which may be true, but isn\u2019t our wedding about us?\n\nEDIT/ UPDATE: Well, he says he is willing to give a new stylist a try for the wedding! \n\nBy the way, by no means is his right to his body being taken away from him, and he wasn\u2019t \u201cforced\u201d. My fianc\u00e9 was just expressing being worried to upset his mom, and I wanted to know if that makes me an AH for asking him. \n\nThanks for your input everyone!", "created_utc": 1704298266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xmzkl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fianc\u00e9s_mom_to_cut_his/", "score": 592, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
