He's not likely to shoot himself in the foot like that.", "Lol what an imagination. I am not sexist and definitely never intended to indicate such a thing, this is just extreme. Just telling her what would happen, without any bad intention or sexist meaning behind it as the one you stated. As for clueless, that's my opinion, to me it seems that he might leave her.
