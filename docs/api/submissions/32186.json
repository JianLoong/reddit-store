We live in Pennsylvania, and our families are in Kansas. We\u2019re planning to have the wedding in Kansas, so that no one else has to travel all the way to PA. Because of this my mom and future mother in law are helping us get everything planned.\n\nWhen I asked if my mom wanted to tour the venue, she said no, because she doesn\u2019t like driving in Kansas City. I told her that was fine and M.I.L. would tour instead. The tour went good, and we found a great place.\n\nA few months later, I get a call that from my mom asking why we didn\u2019t ask her to go to the cake tasting. I was confused, because we hadn\u2019t had a tasting yet, but she doesn\u2019t believe me when I tell her that. We\u2019d talked to her about what we might want for our cake, but we just hadn\u2019t gotten around to scheduling anything. So I scheduled a cake tasting and told her she could go, and even gave her all the combinations of cake and frosting we wanted to try. A few weeks before the tasting I came out as nonbinary, because with all the wedding planning, my fiance wanted to make sure I was comfortable with phrasing during the ceremony, etc. Well on the day of the cake tasting, my mom said she wasn\u2019t going because she felt it just came out of the blue and she didn\u2019t feel like she could be around people right after hearing I\u2019m nonbinary. I told her that I was a bit hurt that I had planned the tasting for her to go, but I would just get my M.I.L. to go instead.\n\nA month after that, she called and asked how my wedding dress was coming along. I had picked it out right after the engagement, because I just knew it was the dress. No one went shopping with me, because they were all in another state. When I told her I was having it altered, she made a comment about how she was concerned that it wouldn\u2019t fit. She\u2019s always been quick to comment on my weight, and when I told her not to worry, she just said, \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re comfortable looking however, because I\u2019d be so anxious about the dress being too small.\u201d I let it go and told her not to worry.\n\nLast week she called and was mad because she thought my fiance and I had gotten married in a courthouse here in PA without her. When I told her that absolutely wasn\u2019t the case, she went on a whole tirade about how I\u2019m not including her in the wedding and she feels like I\u2019m replacing her with my M.I.L. We had a huge fight about it, because I have no clue where she\u2019s getting all this from, and finally I just told her she didn\u2019t need to come to the wedding, because it as clearly upsetting her. She got mad, and said that I didn\u2019t love her. I told her that I had been trying to keep her involved, but she kept starting problems that didn\u2019t need to be problems.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1701526479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1894mdu/aita_for_uninviting_my_mom_to_my_wedding/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Enough is enough. \nWeddings are stressful enough without having someone nagging, nitpicking and well, being a lousy example of what a loving parent should be.\nWhy is she making up stuff to cause chaos? Congratulations OP. Have a grand time at your wedding. Your wedding. Your choice", "NTA your mom isn\u2019t supportive, in fact she sounds pretty toxic. Sounds like the wedding will be a lot less stressful without her there. I\u2019d think about going low contact to make life overall less stressful. Mom has narcissistic tendencies and likes getting you upset.", "Nta. However, there may be something wrong with your mother.

Some of the things that she has assumed and said could indicate some mental illness or decline.", "NTA, your mom sounds like a narcissist. Instead of it being your day, she\u2019s making it all about her. Invite who you want", "NTA. Do you understand that your mother is being passive-aggressive? It is a form of abuse. She refuses to be involved with the various wedding plans yet complains about being excluded. And then that jab about your dress fitting. That is exactly what being passive-aggressive is. Throwing an insult wrapped in supposed concern. Or acting like the victim. You are much better off not having her negativity at your wedding. And frankly, I would keep her on low contact to no contact because she is going to try & cause problems in your marriage.", "NTA - its your wedding and if you feel your mom is not supportive it makes sense to not want her there. \n\nI think if you do want to have a relationship with your mother in the future, disinviting her to your wedding would make it really hard to recover from so thats up to you, but totally your right.", "NTA. Your mom seems to have some serious issues she needs to work through. Your wedding is not the place for her to do that. \n\nHowever, depending on how much time you have left before the ceremony, she might have the opportunity to get her shit together and make you comfortable with her presence.", "NTA\n\nYour mother seems to be delusional and paranoid and you'd be much better without those issues at your wedding.", "It sounds like she is having memory issues\u2026", "NTA, but... dis-inviting her seems drastic and might damage your relationship forever. I wonder if something is wrong, health-wise, since she's accusing you of things that have not happened, like your getting married. (I take it your father is not in the picture, and there is no relative or friend to ask about whether they've noticed any changes in your mom.)\n\nMaybe you should straight out ask her if there is some other issue, maybe a health problem, that she's not telling you about.

There's something going with your Mom where some jealousy has replaced normalcy.  If you do eventually allow her to come to the wedding, I'd strongly encourage you to appoint someone as 'security' for Mom.  Someone who has the wherewithal and authority to remove Mom from the venue just in case...good luck", "NTA. If this is new behavior, then FYI, sometimes the early stages of dementia present as confusion, anger, and paranoia. With my MIL one of the earliest signs was that she stopped driving. We didn't know it at the time, but she was getting lost when she drove and had to ask strangers for help.", "I think you overreacted. There's no need to uninvite her. She clearly is having some emotional/mental problems, because she's making up issues that don't exist as well as uncharitably baiting you about your weight. Just minimize contact and welcome her to the wedding.", "To be honest, your problems with your mom don't seem to far from what a lot of people put up with in their relationships sometimes. Not everything is always rosy, and personalities clash and all that. \n\nWhile what you describe isn't great, I think uninviting her from the wedding was a bit harsh. However the consensus these days is that everyone is supposed to go NC with everyone for the slightest thing...", "Perhaps your mom thrives on drama because she's unhappy in her life? Whatever the case, she can either drop the drama,  behave, and go to the wedding, or decide her behavior is in the right, refuse to change and have it her hill to die on. \n\nNTA", "Are you sure there's nothing wrong with your mother, health-wise? Because she sounds irrational to the point of early senility or something. \n\nAnyway, NTA. You're right that she keeps creating problems out of nothing.\n\nI hope you make it up before the wedding, though. It might create a sad memory, and that would be awful, to associate something sad with your wedding.", "???\n\nNTA, but it seems like there\u2019s a lot of unspoken history between you and your mother that\u2019s fueling this current conflict. Because if this is truly coming out of nowhere, I\u2019d be very concerned about your mother\u2019s cognitive health. She sounds *extremely* paranoid, and maybe doesn\u2019t have the strongest grasp on reality.", "It sounds like a lot of things in OP and her mother's relationship have been bubbling to the top since the wedding prep has heated matters up.\n\nUnfortunately, what's coming up ain't the cream...", "Suggesting? Yeah, that would have been appropriate. Looked like she said \"don't come\". It came off a little harsher to me. At any rate, NTA. My mom pulled a similar stunt the night before my brother's wedding and was wildly inappropriate and then humiliated me in front of my grandmother after my brother and his fiance left. Sometimes you have to put your foot down.", "Definitely NTA.  I agree.  Have your wedding, but perhaps start thinking of letting her go a bit.  Grieving a person who is still alive is tough, but I recommend it for your own mental health.  Gather your supports.  She is not one of them.", "I was concerned about this too you didn\u2019t mention her age but mental health is always a concern and dementia can appear early and manifest itself in the strangest ways. \n\nAnother possible explanation might be other family members \u201cstirring the pot\u201d so to speak, especially if you have really conservative family members or if she\u2019s in a church group that might agitate her thinking. How many times have we heard about group chats escalating stuff and you would have no clue what was said if you weren\u2019t in the chat. \n\nIt just seems to me from what you\u2019ve written that this seems maybe out of character for her?", "Either memory issues OR someone is in her ear. They are states away, so it might just be an unknown toxic enabler feeding her tales.", "A revoked invitation is not the same as NC.\n\nAnd a person who has told you repeatedly how unhappy they are with the *planning* part of the wedding is a person who isn\u2019t likely to be much happier on your actual wedding day. The last thing a newlywed couple needs is a sour, miserable family member casting a pall over the celebration. If mom can\u2019t summon even a scrap of joy for her kid\u2019s marriage, and even *thinking* about the wedding is stressing her out, it\u2019s safe to conclude that she will not enjoy the event, and would be better off staying home.", "\ud83d\ude44", "NTA\n\nYour mom is kinda manipulative. Notice how she made you coming out all about herself and how SHE felt? That's really toxic honestly.\n\nShe starts problems where there are none and then acts like an entitled drama queen. Time to set some hard boundaries or just let go. She sounds exhausting and stressful", "OP, how old is your mom?  Because this reminds me so much of some episodes of dementia I've seen.", "Look I wouldn\u2019t call you the AH here. But uninviting your parent to your wedding is a nuclear option. And although you didn\u2019t technically uninvite her, just suggested it would be ok if she didn\u2019t come, she definitely isn\u2019t going to read it that way.\n\nIf this is new behavior, I would be concerned and revisit what\u2019s going on with her. If it\u2019s not then I would not expect this action to be something you or her will get over soon.

She's overly something but isn't actually creating problems beyond confusion. You're barring access to a once in a lifetime event. Those aren't similar. \n\nBlock/invite who you want. Just realize that you'll be escalating.", "Yeah, this sounded more like mom's memory not like mom was making trouble. My mom is going through a bit of lingering sedation dementia from surgery and this sounds like she does when she first wakes up.\n\nOP, have your dad or another close family member have her checked out.\n\neta: Also have your dad check the carbon monoxide detectors.", "Especially newly being overwhelmed with driving in a city but not being overwhelmed with driving in the local neighborhood.", "It's true that it can be difficult to judge the tone at second hand! But even if she said bluntly 'don't come', it does sound as though her frustration at her mother is justified. \n\nWhen people are repeatedly difficult and uncooperative, there's only so many chances they can get given...", "NTA.\n\nIt's at this point she can apologize and get on-board with whatever you're doing, and not complain at all, or not be invited.  Simple as that.", "Some people cannot be kind or helpful or gracious. I\u2019m sorry that you are going through this! It\u2019s ok to take a break from people who hurt you. The wedding dress comment was hurtful and she knew it. \n\nYou are NTA if you uninvited her. I hope you have a wonderful wedding!", "Your mom is at least toxic and this is main character red flag. She needs help from a professional. Go on with your life without guilt. NTA. Congrats on the wedding", "Your mother declined an invitation to tour the venue, declined an invitation to the cake tasting that was planned around her attendance, and is making some really ugly cracks about your size with respect to the wedding dress. (Why on earth would you worry that a dress that's being made and altered to fit you would be too small? This is some choice B.S. calculated to make you feel that no matter what the size of the dress, you will still be perceived as too big.)\n\nShe has out of the blue accused you of doing the cake-tasting without informing her, of getting married by a justice of the peace, and of not including her in wedding planning. \n\nHonestly, I think you'd be better off refusing to discuss the wedding or anything about the wedding with her.  You don't need the grief when you deserve to be celebrating. And whether or not you wish to include her is entirely up to you.  You're not an A either way.  I think that with her very bad and undermining behavior, she doesn't deserve to be there; if you generously decide to include her, you're extremely forgiving.\n\nNTA either way.", "She\u2019s always been very critical, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard her say that she\u2019s proud of my accomplishments or happy for me regarding how my life is going. But she\u2019s never been this antagonistic about it.", "She\u2019s always been nervous driving in big cities. She doesn\u2019t know how to use gps, and she gets really anxious about the amount of traffic.

I know it\u2019s not my future mother in law, because they don\u2019t talk to each other outside of family events. I think they\u2019ve talked to each other maybe twice. But other than my stepdad and my sister (who\u2019s been low contact with our mom for a while) she doesn\u2019t talk to her family.", "She\u2019s 55", "She\u2019s always been a bit\u2026 hard to please, but never quite to this extent. I\u2019ll definitely reach out to family to closer to Kansas and see if they\u2019ve noticed anything odd about her behavior though!", "I don't know if this is applicable for you or not, but for my mom she becomes hypercritical around weddings as she sees it as her losing control over her children/them leaving her behind to start their own families. So she has all kinds of misbehavior or overcompensation to try to prove that she isn't losing control.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with my mom's memory, no medical conditions. She has a personality disorder and she's an asshole (the two don't always go together, but its a heck of a combination when they do).", "Best of luck. This can be really hard to navigate, especially when someone is acting out of character and you\u2019re not there to find out more information. Hope things turn out okay."]}
