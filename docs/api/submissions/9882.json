The social contract where you take care of your family when they are older relies on the family helping you during your adulthood so you are able to help them later. \n\nI don't think kids owe their parents anyway but your parents really aren't owed a thing and asking to stay with you is hilarious.

He will also help your parents in the same way as he sees their need. You explain that you have a very happy little family that you are proud of, love and adore. Bringing your parents into that, knowing they won't approve of your relationships or other decisions you make and choose to do to keep you and your family feeling loved, safe, warm and welcomed in your own home, may cause issues that you can not foresee yet. Letting them move in may be easier than making them move out after issues come up. Your parents are grown adults and have more experience of providing for themselves than you did when you started. \n  We are supposed to treat others the way we want others to treat us. Not acting out of vengeance but out of love and understanding of each other. Most of us, develop rocky relationships with our parents in our teenage years as we struggle to make adult decisions, spread our wings and chase our own dreams, disappointing our parents in the process and destroying what dreams they had for us while we were growing up. When we reach a certain maturity level, hopefully before its too late and someone passes away, we learn to accept each other and realize love is always there even if you don't always feel it.\n  Coming to you the way they did, knowing the past, could not have been an easy thing for them to do.

I think maybe your here to reassure yourself you done the right thing asking for popular opinion. I would have to agree that letting your parents move in to your \"happy\" home would be a huge mistake, but not offering to help them at all knowing they are in need, assuming you would help others if you could and that you want to help them in some way if so that they can see that you do love them, and that you do not hold any grudges, malice or ill will towards them, and that you really want them to be successful and happy cause you love them regardless, ? Maybe you can offer them some cash to help pay a month's rent in their own place. Just make sure you tell them your only doing it cause you love them, that its a one time thing cause you don't have it like that either and that them moving in with your family would not work out and would only cause more hard feelings between you and them in the long run..\n   I think maybe that's what I would do for my parents if things were as you described between me and mine. I think I would regret doing nothing and just saying \"NO\". You have to live with the decisions you make, & its a good thing to be the better person. If you can't be better than you were yesterday, then at least be better than they were way back when you felt wronged..   LOVE EACH OTHER. LIFE IS SHORT.

Since they only contacted you because they need something, that's all they want from you. Short term financial assistance, not a relationship. If I'm reading this situation correctly, that's the heart of the problem for you.   \n\n\nPeople make mistakes. Good people apologize and learn from them. You own parents turned you out with 5 minutes to grab a few things, no warning, no means to support yourself. You could have become homeless, preyed upon, gone hungry. It wasn't tough love. You weren't doing drugs. Weren't stealing from relatives. Didn't graffiti the house. You're a lesbian. So what? \n\nThere is nothing wrong with avoiding being used. Your parents seem unwilling to admit they betrayed you as only a parent could. Forgiving them is good for your soul, but that doesn't mean you have to keep accepting that behavior. Forgive, relish your happy life, and move on, rather than getting sucked back in to family drama. \n\nMy biggest problem with this is that they did not tell you that they were wrong not to seek you out to repair the relationship. That they were wrong to treat you that way. The longer it went on, the harder it seemed to reach out, until they just got used to the silence between you. An apology is balm for a wound. Instead, they acted entitled. \n\nIt's up to you if you decided to help them out in any way. They will not apologize or acknowledge they did you a great harm. \n\nI will add this. Such a wound like this can cause lasting repercussions that can be hard to identify. You didn't mention if this was the first time your parents displayed such a$$holery. I assume that any parent who would throw their child out on the street has exhibited bad behavior before. If so, then perhaps the Crappy Childhood Fairy on Youtube might be of help. I started watching her channel recently, and it's helped.   \n\n\nGood luck. Best wishes.", "It always makes me angry that there's still bigotries like this.
