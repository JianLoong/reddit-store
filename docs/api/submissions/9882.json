The fact that your parents thought they had the right to even contact you, let alone ask for money, it just a testament to the people they really are. Don\u2019t feel any guilt about this. Not at all.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe them anything.\n\nHowever, because I  petty am as hell, I would suggest if you did want to help them out, you make them give multiple public affirmations to what ever congregation or social group that lead them to throw you out to begin with that your lifestyle is not wrong, that they support same sex relationships and that they are in full support of your relationship.  That and have them post repeatedly on social media the same thing and attend x number of gay pride rallies.\n\nThey would never agree I believe, but they need to understand that their beliefs are keeping you from helping them rather than the fact that you are being cruel and selfish.", "When I told my wife that I felt a little guilty about it, she told me I was 100% allowed to get a kick out of that poetic justice lol", "Yeah was going to say this- THEY DISOWNED YOU OP- and didnt bother to try and reconcile until they needed you to help them. Well too flipping bad- they did indeed make this bed with their own sh\\*tty bigoted lifestyle choices and they can lay in it.", "OP did want to take the high ground, by first ignoring them and then turning them down without comment. Dad insisted on further explanation and got the simplest and most eloquent answer back that OP could give - his own words. \n\nIf his words sound cruel and selfish, imagine how cruel they sounded to an 18 year old that had just been kicked out of their house with nothing. \n\nWhen you're a shitty person looking in the mirror hurts. Too bad, it sucks to suck, I would have laughed in his face.", "Same. I am a major empath and would honestly probably help them in most situations, if I were in OP\u2019s shoes.\n\nBut NOT in this case..OP, you are most definitely NTA.", "Very well said. \n\n OP's parents literally made her struggle on every level, not just financially, to prove their homophobic point and have the audacity to complain that she's being cruel to prove a point!", "You can fucking bet they wouldn't be able to keep their mouths shut and make trouble as well.", "Thank you so much! My wife and our baby girl are the best part of my life, I'd do it all over again exactly the same way if it meant always ending up with the two of them.\n\nI had been taught by my family that being *out* meant being in misery, because \"sinful\" behavior would lead to a life of suffering. But now I get to fall asleep next to my wife every night, and I get to make our daughter smile, and we get to have a home that is full of laughter and built on love. I know that there's no way for any of this to be a sin, not when my life brings me more joy than I ever thought I could feel.", "Oh, and please find out how they got your number, then change your number and cut the person who shared your info out of your life if you think they'll share info again. Don't be afraid to burn bridges with people who endanger you or your family", "I have a brother, he's pretty religious too and we don't talk much but he's never been out right \"cruel\" to me about my sexuality, he's said that he doesn't agree with it but he doesn't hate me. He was at my wedding at least so I guess that's something.", "Hahhahah OP should definitely send thoughts and prayers", "nah, steal the can they beg for money with.", "What OP did was far from cruel. More like karma in my opinion. They kicked OP out for being lesbian and basically disowned her, then have the audacity to contact OP to seek financial help? They made their bed, now they have to lie in it", "In situations like this, fuck being the bigger person. Be microscopic \ud83d\ude02\n\nThey're grown adults that made the choice to disown her. They can reach out to churches, charities, or assistance programs. I've made my peace with my mother kicking me out for a bs reason, but have shot her down any time she's asked me for help outside of setting up deliveries for her. I will never live with or financially support her ever again and she knows it's her own damn fault.", "It's not cruel in any way turn down help for people who hurted you badly'. She doesn't have to help that disgusting people. If they were good people maybe they would have family to get support from. She is not \"retaliating\" since she isn't the cause of their problema and it's not her licking them out of their house like they did to her.", "You feel guilty because you have a heart. They don't.", "Your wife is awesome.", "Don\u2019t feel guilty. Your parents were legally obligated to support you to 18. The second that legal obligation was done and you did something they didn\u2019t like, they threw you out. Your parents are not entitled to anything for \u201csupporting\u201d you growing up because that was their legal and moral obligation. If they pester you about it again, just ask why they want to partake in your sInFuL lIfEsTyLe? Surely living with two lesbians who are actively having lesbian sex and being lesbian married is not just condoning such a \u201clifestyle,\u201d but actively encouraging and benefitting from it?", "She's right!!", "This! They didn't even reach out when she married and had their grandchild? But now that they need money, OP is suddenly good enough? They really deserve to rot in hell.", "They chose not to have a relationship with you. That was their choice,", "This one. They didn\u2019t just abandon you, they disowned you. I mean financial hardship is exactly the point.\n\nWe don\u2019t tolerate intolerance in a tolerant society.", "Maybe they should ask him for help. \n\nYour parents have done nothing but reiterate they are bad people. The absolute gall to reach out to someone they disowned now they need help is almost impressive it it wasn't so pathetic. \n\nDon't waiver. Don't give them a cent. You don't need that toxicity in your life, nor in your daughter's life.", "I for a fact wouldn\u2019t be the bigger person in this situation", ">her licking them out of their house\n\nLOL\n\nEdit: Am I going to hell for thinking this is funny? I guess I don't care.", "I hope OP sees this comment too. She's a much better person than the people who raised her.", "Yes.  And pretend every post saying you are NTA has one more upvote.", "She's the best :')", "Actively being lesbian married lol. \n\nAnd don't forget they'll have to witness their precious granddaughter (who they've never met) being lesbian parented. The horror"]}
