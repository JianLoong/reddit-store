We don\u2019t have any kids together, but he has a 10-year-old daughter from his last marriage, Emma. Dan and his ex-wife Eve, both get equal time with Emma. Dan and Emma have always had a good relationship, and I love Emma to death\u2026 she\u2019s a great kid.\n\nOn the other hand, Eve and Dan don\u2019t get along and she has never liked me\u2026 and I understand the resentment, Dan has said that when they were together that he was not a great husband to her, and their divorce was tough on everyone involved.\n\nThe problem started when Dan was worried because Emma was acting like something was wrong, but she wouldn\u2019t tell him anything.\n\nI eventually talked to Emma, and she told me that over the holiday, her cousins had made jokes about her chest/body and told her that she needs to wear a bra. She thought that her training bra would be fine with the shirt that she wore that day, but that the cousins still noticed her chest and made fun of her. She didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling her dad what happened, because, in her own words, she \u201cfelt gross.\u201d\n\nI did the best that I could to comfort her about what happened. I told her that she isn\u2019t \u201cgross\u201d but rather that she is perfectly normal, and her cousins were just being awful. She seemed to feel better after we talked for a while, and I told her she's always welcome to talk to me about \"girl stuff.\u201d\n\nLater I told Dan what she said, and I asked him if it would be weird if I took Emma out to buy her a couple of bras with different support/padding, along with new clothes. He said that he didn\u2019t think so and he even offered to go himself but said that he would be clueless, and it would probably be awkward for both of them.\n\nSo, the next day I asked her if she wanted to go, and she was up to it, so I took her. We didn\u2019t get her anything crazy, just some clothes and underwear to last her until she promptly grows again in a week.\n\nThe night before Emma was supposed to go back to Eve, I (stupidly) decided to text Eve to let her know what had happened, that Dan and I had handled it already and that while Emma was okay, that she might want to check in on her.\n\nEve sent me a super long reply, saying that it was not appropriate of me to have \u201cbody conversations\u201d with Emma, and that I had crossed a pretty serious line. Eve said that in the future, she wants Dan and I to let her handle all body conversations and situations with Emma\u2026 because these things should be handled by her mother\u2026 something she said I would understand if I had kids of my own.\n\nI told her that if I had known this was important to her, I would\u2019ve reached out to her and let her handle it\u2026 but I was only trying to help Emma, a child that I love dearly.\n\nIt was pretty clear that her feelings were hurt that she missed a milestone with Emma and that she doesn\u2019t trust me. Dan says that she\u2019s just inventing problems, but I can\u2019t help but feel like even if I had good intentions that I might have accidentally overstepped.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669610354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6mx0b/aita_for_taking_my_stepdaughter_to_buy_clothes/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly Eve didn't notice or care enough to talk to Emma. Your husband did and you did. Mom doesn't get to be mad when she ignored her own daughter. \n\nThis is also coming from someone who often would have chosen to go to get step parents over her parents because i have had better relationships with them. \n\nI think you handled it well. You weren't having a body talk with her out of the blue. Something was clearly wrong, you asked, were given an answer and spoke to her father to fix it. If dad didn't have a problem, it should be fine. And i will fight anyone calling you the asshole here\n\nAnd please continue to be a safe person for Emma to the best of your ability. Because you are a parent. It doesn't matter that you came into her life later. And if she trusts you, then you're a safe adult and she might trust you with other stuff down the line that if she doesn't have another safe adult, she'll keep bottled up.", "NTA. It\u2019s great that Emma feels comfortable enough with you to talk about these things, I don\u2019t believe any line was crossed here", "NTA. Ex has equal time with Emma, & could/should have been on top of this whole advancing puberty/clothing size issue so Emma's cousins couldn't make fun of her & humiliate her to start with. You showed empathy & compassion for Emma, who clearly trusts you, & you helped her out when she was dealing with her first sexual harassment, which wouldn't have happened if her mother was paying attention. Ex seems to be trying to stir up shit because she's embarrassed she didn't notice all this herself & Emma confided in you, honestly, which is a her problem & does not make you an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I agree with Eve that this was a parenting issue,  you ARE a parent to Emma. As her stepmother, you also help in the parenting of Emma. It's not like Emma can schedule when these kinds of things are going to come up and only deal with them when she is with her mother. The fact that she felt comfortable talking to you about it is awesome and should be celebrated, not criticized. Honestly, jealousy over Emma's comfort in talking to you is probably what Eve is reacting to. Ignore Eve and keep being an awesome step mom to Emma; she's the important one.", "NTA honestly something like that happened with me she took me to get my hair dyed and cut along with going to the store and buying me some bras the only thing my mom got upset about was the I didn\u2019t tell her I was getting my hair done.\n\nAnyways there\u2019s a reason she went to you and not her Mom. Talking with family members you are familiar with can be harder then talking with someone you are semi familiar with. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Eve is going to have to accept Emma's right to be able to depend on other adults beside her mother.  It doesn't matter what the ex says, when the child is living with the other parent, that parent needs to take care of them. If that means getting help from other people, get over it. \n\nGlad for Emma she's comfortable enough with you to confide in you.", "NTA. Despite what others are saying, buying a bra isn\u2019t a \u201cmilestone\u201d for everyone. A good parent does what you do, they don\u2019t treat it as a huge deal and just go buy some along with maybe a few other things as needed. My mom flat out refused to buy me a bra that wasn\u2019t a training bra, and I needed one. I had to use Xmas gift cards to figure that out myself. It wasn\u2019t some sort of a \u201cmilestone\u201d to be celebrated, it was a necessity, and that was a need that wasn\u2019t being met. You saw your child needing something, you took care of your child\u2019s needs. You were being a parent, doing what a parent does. A stepchild is still a stepparent\u2019s responsibility, and you were being responsible. Thank you for being there for that kid, recognizing what she needed, and taking care of it in an appropriate and subtle way.", "NTA she's old enough to start make choices about what she wants to wear and who she is comfortable talking about *her* experiences with. You did the right thing letting Eve know because she is Emma's mother- but if Emma wants to talk about these things with her stepmother that should be an option she has.", "NTA You asked Emma what was wrong and she confided in you. She clearly trusted you and saw you as someone she wanted to have that conversation with. As she's dealing with body issues, it should be up to her who she talks to (as long as she's not asking you to keep secrets, etc.)\n\nYou also included both of her bio parents in your debrief. It's not your fault that one of them reacted negatively instead of appreciating Emma got the support she needed.", "NTA - you did what you were supposed to do. Eve may have missed a milestone but I'd at least take comfort in knowing that someone caring and trustworthy was there for my child in a moment like that.", "NTA, did you make the kid feel better? Did you give Eve the heads up? Then she can have a coke and a smile. My cousin went through the same thing with his Ex she raged hard simpy because of how things ended", "NTA. That was nice of you to help your stepdaughter. The mother should at least appreciate that you care.", "Nta. If it was so important to her she would have handled it before her daughter felt she needed more support.", "NTA not your fault she\u2019s growing up in a split home.  Bio mom only gets to parent 183 days a year.  Sue\u2019s going to miss out on plenty", "**NTA** \n\nIt was good of you to notice the problem, talk to Emma and take action to solve her problem. \n\nSure buying a bra is a big step and usually done with the mother but as this problem has gone unnoticed by Eve, Emma was very lucky you stepped up. \n\nEve is just salty that you were a better mother to Emma than she was.", "NTA - Can someone tell me what\u2019s the big deal about the mom missing a \u201cmilestone\u201d? I think the daughter\u2019s feelings trump her mom\u2019s because it was the daughter who was feeling insecure. The daughter went to the adult who she felt comfortable with, no one can blame OP for that. \n\nI personally find that weird because when I needed my first bra, my mom just took me to the store and bought me one? It wasn\u2019t a sentimental moment. \n\nI get it when it\u2019s their first period but a bra? But maybe I\u2019m just not the sentimental type?", "NTA, Emma came to you and you handled it exceptionally.  Maybe her other mother is projecting anger because she didn\u2019t notice her daughter had developed a bust and was being bullied by family members.  You did a nice thing, and showed your stepdaughter that a bonus mom also cares and she can come to you if she needs help.", "NTA. A bra is a tight tank top for the chest that holds breasts in place. It's nothing more. It's not actually a \"big milestone\", society just things getting breasts = being woman even though it's 100% not. She was most comfortable talking to YOU. It's her choice. You were in the right to inform her mother, but getting a bra is a quite simple thing.", "NTA\n\nBut Dan slightly TA, he should have spoken to Eve about it straight away. \n\nYou spoke to Dan and got the permission to deal with the situation. You don't need to feel bad about it, I think Eve would be less angry if the message came from Dan instead too. \n\nAlso, Eve needs to understand its not all about if I am the mother only I can deal with it. As a woman you managed to look after another woman's needs and she should have thanked you for it.", "NTA - in case 'Eve' hasn't heard about it, there is this thing called 'the internet' where people discuss all kinds of things, including 'body conversations' so it should be great that the kid has some adults she can trust rather than getting advice from a bunch of strangers on the internet......oh wait..........LOL", "Info: When you say holiday, do you mean Thanksgiving? Was she with her Mom at any point after the comments happened?", "The mother is concentrating on the \u201cmilestone.\u201d But this was about her being hurt by kids comments and being body shamed and needing to be reassured that things will be ok. You take care of that right away!", "You couldn\u2019t have possibly known it was important to Eve without her telling you prior. Now that you know and the boundary has been set your shouldn\u2019t actively seek to cross it. \n\nThat being said Emma has thoughts and feelings of her own and she chose to talk to you about it when she, presumably, could have talked to her mom about it if she wanted to (I\u2019m assuming Emma could have called her). It would be confusing and hurtful to Emma if she tries to initiate conversation with you about a sensitive topic and you say \u201cnope, your mom said I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you about that\u201d. Gotta agree with Dan here that Eve is inventing problems cause her feelings are hurt. NTA", "NTA as you are a mom and Emma trusts you, but now you know how the mom feels it's important going forward to give her the opportunity to have those bonding moments with her daughter.", "NTA - Mixed families are a mixed bag of issues when co-parents resent each other. Issues pop up at both homes. Mother wasn't present or available. Closest thing to a stand-in took initiative and helped daughter emotionally and physically. Mother should be grateful daughter has people who love and support her when she isn't there. I can understand her envy and hurt feelings not being a part of something like this. But mom's feelings aren't as important as daughters in this case. Mom missed out on something, daughter was actively struggling with something. Also you asked her father if it was appropriate and okay for you to help. The issue here is between  her and her ex. They need to sort out boundaries. You my dear did NOTHING wrong. Your daughter is very lucky to have you. <3", "NTA.  If she felt comfortable talking to her mother, she would have.  Dan is right, she is creating problems.  I would suggest in the future though that you let Dan text her and tell her, \u201cwe got Emma some new bras and clothes as she got teased by her cousins.\u201d  The key is limiting the information that Eve gets to the basics so Emma doesn\u2019t get flack from her mom.", "NTA, but the mother has set a boundary and I would just apologize and respect that moving forward. It seems pretty reasonable and her dad gave it the OK, but I wonder if theres a way that you can encourage Emma to share this info with her mom if it comes up in the future?", "NTA.", "ESH except Emma\n\nWhoever\u2019s side of the family those cousins were on need to have a serious discussion with them; it is unacceptable to make fun of family like that especially at that age.\n\nIf she\u2019s getting that noticeable, Eve should have done this with her daughter already, not to mention noticing her being down.\n\nYou should\u2019ve told Eve what you were planning. These are milestone days.\n\nDan needs to be able to have conversations like this with his daughter; just because it\u2019s a girl thing doesn\u2019t mean mothers will always be around. It\u2019s tragic but it\u2019s true. All children should be able to rely on all parents equally, speaking as a daughter who has resented my father her whole life for not being able to discuss \u201cgross\u201d things. It takes two to tango, and two to have a sex talk.\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up too much. It is a big deal but as you said one that can easily be discussed more and more as she blossoms.", "NAH.  Emma came to you with a problem and you talked to her dad about it before acting.  Eve doesn\u2019t want you involved in that part of parenting her child.  Also, valid.  A boundary has been establish now.", "Your intentions were certainly good, and it's great for a child to have lots of people who care about them that way. But as a mother, I get the mother's point of view as well. That's a big milestone, and I personally would have been super bummed if I missed it. On the flip side, I would also want my daughter to feel loved and supported wherever she goes, and thats what you did for her. \nSo I would give it a very soft YTA. Did you overstep? Yeah, but not cause of the conversation, more the first bra shopping thing. \nBut did you overstep on purpose? No, that came from a good place.", "Nta bc u truly didn\u2019t know. Next time, following the mom wishes, and txt/call Eve for events like that. Your heart is in the right place", "Maybe a little bit of YTA because taking her to buy her first bra is a pretty big milestone and you took that away from her Mom. This wasn't a situation where it had to be immediately handled and would have probably been better to talk to her but let Mom take the lead on this.", "Slight YTA\n\nI get Eve\u2019s point because you aren\u2019t her mother. Even though you did talk to Dan, this really should\u2019ve been brought to Eve\u2019s attention. You crossed a parenting boundary. Even though you love Emma, she\u2019s not your responsibility and you can\u2019t do certain things.\n\nEve can still talk to Emma more in depth. Since Emma talked to you, it\u2019s a good sign that she\u2019s comfortable with you.", "Why didn\u2019t you contact her mom before doing milestone stuff with her daughter? YTA for not asking. Of course a mom would want to be there for her daughters first bra shopping trip. Are you gonna take her shopping for prom, too?", "YTA a girl getting a bra for the first time is a big milestone. I am a mother and I would be upset too.\n\nYou taking her for clothes and talking about what upset her with her cousins is not a big deal to me especially since you let the mom know. Just letting her dad know is fine and he can share with the mom if he wants. \n\nWhy didn't the girl share this with her mom though I wonder?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's something that needs immediate attention. And chances are, Emma is going to be more comfortable telling step mom over dad. And it's going to cause more issues if step mom says \"hey, i can't talk to you about this. You'll have to go to your mom\" because there's no way to put it, that won't make it sound like step mom is saying Emma can't come to her with those things and that would damage the relationship.\n\nMom needs to accept the fact that step mom is in fact a parent, is in this kid's life and is going to play a role. She needs to be more realistic about the boundaries being set. And \"not talking about body things\" is not an acceptable boundary.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only about the info here but also that this woman took her daughter to buy her first bra. I\u2019d feel a type of way about her confiding in someone else, but know I have no right to be mad. I would be more angry she took it upon herself to go buy the first bra instead of letting me know I may need to do that for my daughter", "Woa, first award, thank you!", "Except it's not valid. I mean, her not wanting it, her feelings about it are her own and valid. But enacting the boundary with it, is not. \n\nThat child spends half the year with dad and step mom. Step mom is a parent. Her and dad are a team. And the blanket can't be no body talk. Emma was comfortable talking to step mom. What happens if she gets her period at her dad's. Is she supposed to call her mom while she's at her dad's and deal with the tumultuous relationship between her parents while also dealing with that just because she can't go to step mom. Also the way being told she can't go to step mom, who has now been established by Emma to be an adult she thinks safe, is going to ruin relationships everywhere.", "Emma's feelings and needs trump her mothers desire to go bra shopping for the first time.", "If it was a big enough deal to mom, she would have noticed her kid's behavior. Dad did. Step mom did. Both were concerned enough to find out what was going on. Clearly mom didn't. Step mom checked with dad first. And it kind of did need to be handled immediately. The girl's self esteem was talking a major hit because of the way she was being treated. The longer that's allowed to fester, the worse it gets. And with the relationship mom has with dad and step mom, there's a solid chance mom might not have done it out of spite because it was at their suggestion.", "Thank you. A lot of people judging the fact that mom didn\u2019t notice. But stepmom didn\u2019t notice anything about the bra til the stepdaughter told her. Maybe she should\u2019ve realized she was upset, but we have no idea what situation mom is in", "Right? Should Emma time her first period for when she's with Eve?", "Yeah I feel like people who are voting y t a are making the whole situation about the mom instead of the child. The important thing is that the child has people she can confide in.", "Soft YTA you should have talked with Mom", "Honestly, you can tell when you need to take your daughter for bras. Eve procrastinated and got mad someone saved Emma from embarassment caused by lack of proactive parenting. Puberty isn't a surprise.", "She didn\u2019t take it upon herself.  She talked to the girl\u2019s father and he gave his permission.  It is up to him to work out with his ex where the line is for consultation, not the stepmother.", "I don\u2019t agree. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It sounds like these events happened over a short period of time while with her Dad and OP for the holiday weekend. Give the Mom an opportunity to discuss and handle this.", ">If it was a big enough deal to mom, she would have noticed her kid's behavior. \n\nIt sounds like all of these events happened over the course of this holiday weekend and she wasn't with her Mom during this time.", "Disagree. The mom was lazy. All it takes is a glance to tell if a girl needs bras.", "Op said in another comment that the mom hasnt seen her yet. She\u2019s been with dad since the holiday so the mom couldn\u2019t have even noticed she was upset. The stepmom did, but she didn\u2019t notice she needed a bra before step-daughter told her. How could the mom have known when it wasn\u2019t even her time with the kid?", "Then the stepmother shouldn\u2019t have been the one to message her", "This isn't a situation where step mom has just entered the picture and is trying to do everything to be mom. This woman has been in the child's life long enough that they've formed a bond. She's been a parent for 4 years (and we don't know how long she was in the picture before marriage). \n\nIt WILL damage relationships all around in their family if that boundary is enforced. It will put further strain between coparents (which the kid knows about. We see it. We know it's there. And any conflict that arises, most kids blame themselves). It will affect the relationship child and step mom have because she had a safe person who now is going to have to say \"hey sorry. I can't be the one to talk to you about this. Either call your mom or go talk to your dad whose clearly awkward about these topics.\" It's going to affect the relationship between mom and daughter because she's going to know mom stole that safe adult from her. \n\nThis isn't something you agree or disagree about. This is facts. Co-parenting is hard on the parents, sure. Especially when there's step- parents because they are parents. It's in the title. But the kids always get the rough end of the stick. And it will affect everything. Eve can enforce a boundary of being included. But she cannot keep step mom out of those talks entirely. Not without it causing serious damage.", "Leave the 10 year old girl you have a good relationship with as her step mother obviously upset because her mother should have the opportunity to help her first \ud83d\ude44 fantastic advice", "Did the breasts grow out over the weekend too? Mom had to notice that new bras were needed!"]}
