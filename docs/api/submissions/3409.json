We don\u2019t have any kids together, but he has a 10-year-old daughter from his last marriage, Emma. Dan and his ex-wife Eve, both get equal time with Emma. Dan and Emma have always had a good relationship, and I love Emma to death\u2026 she\u2019s a great kid.\n\nOn the other hand, Eve and Dan don\u2019t get along and she has never liked me\u2026 and I understand the resentment, Dan has said that when they were together that he was not a great husband to her, and their divorce was tough on everyone involved.\n\nThe problem started when Dan was worried because Emma was acting like something was wrong, but she wouldn\u2019t tell him anything.\n\nI eventually talked to Emma, and she told me that over the holiday, her cousins had made jokes about her chest/body and told her that she needs to wear a bra. She thought that her training bra would be fine with the shirt that she wore that day, but that the cousins still noticed her chest and made fun of her. She didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling her dad what happened, because, in her own words, she \u201cfelt gross.\u201d\n\nI did the best that I could to comfort her about what happened. I told her that she isn\u2019t \u201cgross\u201d but rather that she is perfectly normal, and her cousins were just being awful. She seemed to feel better after we talked for a while, and I told her she's always welcome to talk to me about \"girl stuff.\u201d\n\nLater I told Dan what she said, and I asked him if it would be weird if I took Emma out to buy her a couple of bras with different support/padding, along with new clothes. He said that he didn\u2019t think so and he even offered to go himself but said that he would be clueless, and it would probably be awkward for both of them.\n\nSo, the next day I asked her if she wanted to go, and she was up to it, so I took her. We didn\u2019t get her anything crazy, just some clothes and underwear to last her until she promptly grows again in a week.\n\nThe night before Emma was supposed to go back to Eve, I (stupidly) decided to text Eve to let her know what had happened, that Dan and I had handled it already and that while Emma was okay, that she might want to check in on her.\n\nEve sent me a super long reply, saying that it was not appropriate of me to have \u201cbody conversations\u201d with Emma, and that I had crossed a pretty serious line. Eve said that in the future, she wants Dan and I to let her handle all body conversations and situations with Emma\u2026 because these things should be handled by her mother\u2026 something she said I would understand if I had kids of my own.\n\nI told her that if I had known this was important to her, I would\u2019ve reached out to her and let her handle it\u2026 but I was only trying to help Emma, a child that I love dearly.\n\nIt was pretty clear that her feelings were hurt that she missed a milestone with Emma and that she doesn\u2019t trust me. Dan says that she\u2019s just inventing problems, but I can\u2019t help but feel like even if I had good intentions that I might have accidentally overstepped.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669610354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6mx0b/aita_for_taking_my_stepdaughter_to_buy_clothes/", "score": 3112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly Eve didn't notice or care enough to talk to Emma. Your husband did and you did. Mom doesn't get to be mad when she ignored her own daughter. \n\nThis is also coming from someone who often would have chosen to go to get step parents over her parents because i have had better relationships with them. \n\nI think you handled it well. You weren't having a body talk with her out of the blue. Something was clearly wrong, you asked, were given an answer and spoke to her father to fix it. If dad didn't have a problem, it should be fine. And i will fight anyone calling you the asshole here\n\nAnd please continue to be a safe person for Emma to the best of your ability. Because you are a parent. It doesn't matter that you came into her life later. And if she trusts you, then you're a safe adult and she might trust you with other stuff down the line that if she doesn't have another safe adult, she'll keep bottled up.", "NTA. It\u2019s great that Emma feels comfortable enough with you to talk about these things, I don\u2019t believe any line was crossed here", "NTA. Ex has equal time with Emma, & could/should have been on top of this whole advancing puberty/clothing size issue so Emma's cousins couldn't make fun of her & humiliate her to start with. You showed empathy & compassion for Emma, who clearly trusts you, & you helped her out when she was dealing with her first sexual harassment, which wouldn't have happened if her mother was paying attention. Ex seems to be trying to stir up shit because she's embarrassed she didn't notice all this herself & Emma confided in you, honestly, which is a her problem & does not make you an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I agree with Eve that this was a parenting issue,  you ARE a parent to Emma. As her stepmother, you also help in the parenting of Emma. It's not like Emma can schedule when these kinds of things are going to come up and only deal with them when she is with her mother. The fact that she felt comfortable talking to you about it is awesome and should be celebrated, not criticized. Honestly, jealousy over Emma's comfort in talking to you is probably what Eve is reacting to. Ignore Eve and keep being an awesome step mom to Emma; she's the important one.", "NTA honestly something like that happened with me she took me to get my hair dyed and cut along with going to the store and buying me some bras the only thing my mom got upset about was the I didn\u2019t tell her I was getting my hair done.\n\nAnyways there\u2019s a reason she went to you and not her Mom. Talking with family members you are familiar with can be harder then talking with someone you are semi familiar with. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Eve is going to have to accept Emma's right to be able to depend on other adults beside her mother.  It doesn't matter what the ex says, when the child is living with the other parent, that parent needs to take care of them.

Despite what others are saying, buying a bra isn\u2019t a \u201cmilestone\u201d for everyone. A good parent does what you do, they don\u2019t treat it as a huge deal and just go buy some along with maybe a few other things as needed. My mom flat out refused to buy me a bra that wasn\u2019t a training bra, and I needed one. I had to use Xmas gift cards to figure that out myself. It wasn\u2019t some sort of a \u201cmilestone\u201d to be celebrated, it was a necessity, and that was a need that wasn\u2019t being met. You saw your child needing something, you took care of your child\u2019s needs. You were being a parent, doing what a parent does. A stepchild is still a stepparent\u2019s responsibility, and you were being responsible. Thank you for being there for that kid, recognizing what she needed, and taking care of it in an appropriate and subtle way.", "NTA she's old enough to start make choices about what she wants to wear and who she is comfortable talking about *her* experiences with. You did the right thing letting Eve know because she is Emma's mother- but if Emma wants to talk about these things with her stepmother that should be an option she has.", "NTA You asked Emma what was wrong and she confided in you. She clearly trusted you and saw you as someone she wanted to have that conversation with. As she's dealing with body issues, it should be up to her who she talks to (as long as she's not asking you to keep secrets, etc.)\n\nYou also included both of her bio parents in your debrief. It's not your fault that one of them reacted negatively instead of appreciating Emma got the support she needed.", "NTA - you did what you were supposed to do. Eve may have missed a milestone but I'd at least take comfort in knowing that someone caring and trustworthy was there for my child in a moment like that.", "NTA, did you make the kid feel better? Did you give Eve the heads up? Then she can have a coke and a smile. My cousin went through the same thing with his Ex she raged hard simpy because of how things ended", "NTA. That was nice of you to help your stepdaughter. The mother should at least appreciate that you care.", "Nta. If it was so important to her she would have handled it before her daughter felt she needed more support.", "NTA not your fault she\u2019s growing up in a split home.  Bio mom only gets to parent 183 days a year.  Sue\u2019s going to miss out on plenty", "**NTA** \n\nIt was good of you to notice the problem, talk to Emma and take action to solve her problem. \n\nSure buying a bra is a big step and usually done with the mother but as this problem has gone unnoticed by Eve, Emma was very lucky you stepped up. \n\nEve is just salty that you were a better mother to Emma than she was.", "NTA - Can someone tell me what\u2019s the big deal about the mom missing a \u201cmilestone\u201d? I think the daughter\u2019s feelings trump her mom\u2019s because it was the daughter who was feeling insecure. The daughter went to the adult who she felt comfortable with, no one can blame OP for that. \n\nI personally find that weird because when I needed my first bra, my mom just took me to the store and bought me one? It wasn\u2019t a sentimental moment. \n\nI get it when it\u2019s their first period but a bra? But maybe I\u2019m just not the sentimental type?", "NTA, Emma came to you and you handled it exceptionally.  Maybe her other mother is projecting anger because she didn\u2019t notice her daughter had developed a bust and was being bullied by family members.  You did a nice thing, and showed your stepdaughter that a bonus mom also cares and she can come to you if she needs help.", "NTA. A bra is a tight tank top for the chest that holds breasts in place. It's nothing more. It's not actually a \"big milestone\", society just things getting breasts = being woman even though it's 100% not. She was most comfortable talking to YOU. It's her choice. You were in the right to inform her mother, but getting a bra is a quite simple thing.", "NTA\n\nBut Dan slightly TA, he should have spoken to Eve about it straight away. \n\nYou spoke to Dan and got the permission to deal with the situation. You don't need to feel bad about it, I think Eve would be less angry if the message came from Dan instead too. \n\nAlso, Eve needs to understand its not all about if I am the mother only I can deal with it. As a woman you managed to look after another woman's needs and she should have thanked you for it.", "NTA - in case 'Eve' hasn't heard about it, there is this thing called 'the internet' where people discuss all kinds of things, including 'body conversations' so it should be great that the kid has some adults she can trust rather than getting advice from a bunch of strangers on the internet......oh wait..........LOL", "Info: When you say holiday, do you mean Thanksgiving? Was she with her Mom at any point after the comments happened?", "The mother is concentrating on the \u201cmilestone.\u201d But this was about her being hurt by kids comments and being body shamed and needing to be reassured that things will be ok. You take care of that right away!", "You couldn\u2019t have possibly known it was important to Eve without her telling you prior. Now that you know and the boundary has been set your shouldn\u2019t actively seek to cross it. \n\nThat being said Emma has thoughts and feelings of her own and she chose to talk to you about it when she, presumably, could have talked to her mom about it if she wanted to (I\u2019m assuming Emma could have called her). It would be confusing and hurtful to Emma if she tries to initiate conversation with you about a sensitive topic and you say \u201cnope, your mom said I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you about that\u201d. Gotta agree with Dan here that Eve is inventing problems cause her feelings are hurt. NTA", "NTA as you are a mom and Emma trusts you, but now you know how the mom feels it's important going forward to give her the opportunity to have those bonding moments with her daughter.", "NTA - Mixed families are a mixed bag of issues when co-parents resent each other. Issues pop up at both homes. Mother wasn't present or available. Closest thing to a stand-in took initiative and helped daughter emotionally and physically. Mother should be grateful daughter has people who love and support her when she isn't there. I can understand her envy and hurt feelings not being a part of something like this. But mom's feelings aren't as important as daughters in this case. Mom missed out on something, daughter was actively struggling with something. Also you asked her father if it was appropriate and okay for you to help. The issue here is between  her and her ex. They need to sort out boundaries. You my dear did NOTHING wrong. Your daughter is very lucky to have you. <3", "NTA.  If she felt comfortable talking to her mother, she would have.  Dan is right, she is creating problems.  I would suggest in the future though that you let Dan text her and tell her, \u201cwe got Emma some new bras and clothes as she got teased by her cousins.\u201d  The key is limiting the information that Eve gets to the basics so Emma doesn\u2019t get flack from her mom.", "NTA, but the mother has set a boundary and I would just apologize and respect that moving forward. It seems pretty reasonable and her dad gave it the OK, but I wonder if theres a way that you can encourage Emma to share this info with her mom if it comes up in the future?", "NTA.", "ESH except Emma\n\nWhoever\u2019s side of the family those cousins were on need to have a serious discussion with them; it is unacceptable to make fun of family like that especially at that age.\n\nIf she\u2019s getting that noticeable, Eve should have done this with her daughter already, not to mention noticing her being down.\n\nYou should\u2019ve told Eve what you were planning. These are milestone days.\n\nDan needs to be able to have conversations like this with his daughter; just because it\u2019s a girl thing doesn\u2019t mean mothers will always be around. It\u2019s tragic but it\u2019s true. All children should be able to rely on all parents equally, speaking as a daughter who has resented my father her whole life for not being able to discuss \u201cgross\u201d things. It takes two to tango, and two to have a sex talk.\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up too much. It is a big deal but as you said one that can easily be discussed more and more as she blossoms.", "NAH.  Emma came to you with a problem and you talked to her dad about it before acting.  Eve doesn\u2019t want you involved in that part of parenting her child.  Also, valid.  A boundary has been establish now.", "Your intentions were certainly good, and it's great for a child to have lots of people who care about them that way. But as a mother, I get the mother's point of view as well. That's a big milestone, and I personally would have been super bummed if I missed it. On the flip side, I would also want my daughter to feel loved and supported wherever she goes, and thats what you did for her. \nSo I would give it a very soft YTA. Did you overstep? Yeah, but not cause of the conversation, more the first bra shopping thing. \nBut did you overstep on purpose? No, that came from a good place.", "Nta bc u truly didn\u2019t know. Next time, following the mom wishes, and txt/call Eve for events like that. Your heart is in the right place", "Maybe a little bit of YTA because taking her to buy her first bra is a pretty big milestone and you took that away from her Mom. This wasn't a situation where it had to be immediately handled and would have probably been better to talk to her but let Mom take the lead on this.", "Slight YTA\n\nI get Eve\u2019s point because you aren\u2019t her mother. Even though you did talk to Dan, this really should\u2019ve been brought to Eve\u2019s attention. You crossed a parenting boundary. Even though you love Emma, she\u2019s not your responsibility and you can\u2019t do certain things.\n\nEve can still talk to Emma more in depth. Since Emma talked to you, it\u2019s a good sign that she\u2019s comfortable with you.", "Why didn\u2019t you contact her mom before doing milestone stuff with her daughter? YTA for not asking. Of course a mom would want to be there for her daughters first bra shopping trip. Are you gonna take her shopping for prom, too?", "YTA a girl getting a bra for the first time is a big milestone. I am a mother and I would be upset too.\n\nYou taking her for clothes and talking about what upset her with her cousins is not a big deal to me especially since you let the mom know. Just letting her dad know is fine and he can share with the mom if he wants. \n\nWhy didn't the girl share this with her mom though I wonder?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are you supposed to just let Emma deal with it?  That's ridiculous.  \n\nI suggest you write her back and let her know that you'll inform her when issues come up but that it should be reciprocated so you both know what's going on in her life", "NAH. understandable for eve to be hurt bc she missed a milestone, but also what you did wasn't actually bad", "NTA. Emma was upset, she confided in you. You spoke to her dad about your idea, he gave you the go ahead and now Emma feels better. Eve's response wasn't about you helping her daughter because if she was worried about Emma she would have been pleased that you were there to help her feel comfortable with a difficult situation. Eve needs to place Emma's feelings first.", "NTA. I'm also a mom/step mom and when you sign up for the role, you're in all the way. You did a great job making an awkward moment in life less weird, and she seemed comforted by it. Way to go! I'm guessing birth mama just feels a little threatened, understandably.  Hopefully, in time, she will come to see you as the  asset you are in co-parenting. \n\n\nSide note. Maybe encourage your husband to speak with Eve. To admit to his mistakes in their marriage and being a shitty husband to her. It might help heal some of the wounds of the past. Hopefully in doing so, it might mend their relationship and make the co parenting journey a bit smoother. Good luck!!", "NTA you had a conversation with a child who was upset and struggling with being made fun of because of the way she looks and you did something to help her overcome this issue in the future. Eve better get over herself and get used to the fact that body conversations are going to happen. What happens if Emma is with you both and she gets her period? Does Eve just expect you to send her home? She\u2019s 10 you bought her some bras and had a chat you didn\u2019t put her on the pill and go get tattoos. Definitely didn\u2019t over step.

You learnt next time not to reach out to Eve.", "NTA. And the forceful way she responded is probably Why Emma hasn\u2019t talked to her about it. \n\nTen to one Emma feels overwhelmed, overruled and owner-looked when she tries to speak with her mother about these things. \n\nYou made her feel safe, heard understood and seen. You did absolutely great.", "NTA. Eve might consider you one, but her opinion should be meaningless when compared to Emma's opinion of you", "NTA, you helped your stepdaughter, that's a great thing. Bio moms often have problems with that. \nI had a great bond with my stepmom, my mom hated that and tried to stop it. I'm so glad my dad supported me and my stepmom bonding.

Step Mothers are mothers. (You should watch Disenchanted with Emma). Having more parents who love you never hurt any child and part of being divorced with kids is accepting that they may have more parents, step parents and bio parents and more love and support and that\u2019s a good thing. \n\nYou were there for Emma when she needed you and were a good mom. Her other mom needs to work on her feelings, and realizing you being there for Emma doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t also be there and support her.", "NTA", "Nah - you accidentally overstepped, with best intentions, and apologised", "NTA mom is just being controlling. I would put money on Mom discouraging her kid from having a relationship with you because she\u2019s jealous/angry.", "NTA. As a mum of a little girl I would've just been happy my daughter had a support network that she felt happy to go to, and also that someone else loved her as much as I do. Just a note too, if Emma felt comfortable talking to Eve about this then she would have done. Eve sounds quite bitter, it's no wonder Emma came to you instead.", "What you did was super sweet and thoughtful. NTA at all.", "I\u2019m gonna stay out of this conversation because as a man I don\u2019t have an opinion on this", "NTA.  But I think some private conversations should stay between you and the daughter (and sometimes dad).  Just leave it up to them whether the ex should be notified. I'm so glad she opened up to you. Her mom could twist your words at any time and destroy the trust you built.", "NTA\n\nEve doesn't seem to understand it's a big, cruel world out there and Emma needs all the love and support she can get to navigate it. I've always said there's no greater gift anyone can give me than to love my children. Eve is putting her selfish possessiveness over Emma's long term well being. Continue being a safe person for Emma to turn to because she deserves to have that regardless of which parent she is with at the time.", "NTA in the slightest.\n\nWhile Eve might be a great mom and genuinely just want to be there and help daughter with this, obviously the circumstances prevented that. Puberty is so extremely tough for kids and they need help from *everybody*, not just mom. Dan absolutely needs to step up and be a part of this as well. What's going to happen when Emma's with you guys, and maybe you're at work or something, so it's just her and dad when she gets her period? Will he know what to do? Are there already pads available in the house? It seems like he cares a lot and is trying his best, but he's got to get knowledge about this stuff *now*, before Emma starts having to deal with it.\n\nHopefully you, Dan, and Eve can all sit down and talk to figure out what's best for Emma as she's entering her tweens/teens. It is understandable for Eve to be upset, she's probably just going mama bear about this (especially considering the bad marriage with Dan), but this is about Emma's needs and not her's. Since Emma lives in two homes, she needs to feel safe at BOTH homes to talk with an adult about what she's experiencing. In situations like these, texting and phone calls aren't enough cause they be even more stressful. And obviously her mom simply couldn't have been there to take her shopping at that time.\n\nIt's actually a really, really good thing Emma felt comfortable enough to tell you at all *and* that you were able to help! Also critical too that Dan noticed his daughter was a having a hard time, and although she didn't talk with him, by communicating his concern with you, everything was able to get worked out. Sounds like both you and Dan are doing great by Emma and supporting her.\n\nAfter she's back with Eve, those two can always still go underwear and clothes shopping. Emma can get some more clothing options and they can have their own special mother/daughter bonding experience too. It may be hard on Eve not to be the \"first\" one to help her daughter, but that just means Emma's getting lots of extra help and that's the best possible outcome in this scenario. Much better than her being miserable with you and Dan cause she *isn't* getting the support she needs. All three of you being trusted adults in here life is hugely important.\n\n(Also as an aside, I'm just going to throw this out there as a very small possibility, however unlikely. Puberty sucks for everyone, of course. That plus the bullying (the parents of those cousins *definitely* need to be talked with) will certainly make Emma feel awful about herself. Yet her being uncomfortable with having noticeable breasts and calling it \"gross\"  could potentially be an indicator of gender dysphoria. I only mention this cause that is an extremely common sign for folks who were born female. Again, probably not all at the case, but it seems worth mentioning on the rare chance she could be experiencing that.)", "NTA, your stepdaughter had a problem and you helped her.  You did the right thing. Her mother should be appreciative. \n\nMight have been better not to text the ex wife, I'd let your husband handle all communication that isn't purely logistical.", "NTA. The fact that she has a training bra would tell me that this conversation should've already been had. So unless her mom was just like hear you go and handed her a bra and walked away, she should've already discussed this \"milestone\". You were providing an outside source of validation, and like you said she's going to need more items fairly soon. You did nothing wrong except helped her daughter which every parent should want. Imagine cutting off a child confiding in you because she needs to wait for the week she's at her mom.", "Eh NAH. You only had Emma's best interests in mind, but that is traditionally a mother daughter situation. You did take a milestone away from her biological mother. It should have occurred to your husband to give Eve a call before doing anything, because if Emma was my kid I would want to know that her cousins were bullying her and deal with the outcome myself. I would apologize and explain that it wasn't your intention to overstep and you will call her first in the future when these things happen.

Her mom seemed to be oblivious to her daughter being upset about something.

That being said, it\u2019s not reasonable for her to expect Emma to wait up to a week after something happens to be able to talk about it (yes phones exist but calling or FaceTiming is not the same as talking in person). What does she want to happen when Emma gets her period? Does she expect neither you nor Dan to help her through it?

I think this is a case of miscommunication and you're all in a different realm now that her preteens are beginning. That's all part of co-parenting. Things change on a dime and new boundaries need to be reestablished at a moments notice. I do think she could have been nicer to OP and not be as hostile. Maybe she's projecting her own insecurities regarding her relationship with her daughter since she confided in you and not her. Her feelings were hurt and that's valid.

Continue building your relationship with Emma, you are doing the right thing. \n\nBtw, you sound like someone I would want to \u201cco-parent\u201d with because you obviously want to respect all boundaries in place by both bio parents.

You did the right thing, and EVE is going to let her jealousy of you affect the kid.  You saw Emma was upset, found out why, talked to her dad about it, and made a solution to make her feel better.

Your heart was in the right place and the child clearly appreciated it.", "NTA \nPeople especially children relate differently to different people. There are some things I will happily talk to my mum about, but would never talk to my dad about and vice versa. I also had my nana that I really appreciated being able to talk to, and I often went to her first before either of my parents, she often noticed when I was upset first. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love my parents but sometimes you feel more comfortable talking to an adult that isn\u2019t your parents. \n\nI don\u2019t get why this has to specifically be a mum thing to deal with other than it being for the benefit for the mother? So the child was meant to spend the rest of her time feeling upset, embarrassed and uncomfortable until she went to her mothers, where her mother would potentially not pick up on? That\u2019s so selfish. Surely just feel happy that your child has a step parent that cares about them and takes a proactive approach? And if the mother had let the child know thar she is there for these things the child can make her own decision about how she feels comfortable talking to. again, NTA OP, thank you for actually prioritising the child and not family drama.", "NTA, but you should have reached out to her mom and let her know what had happened to gauge her response and see if she even knew and potentially brushed it off.

We don't know.\n\nBio mom is upset that getting divorced has taken bonding moments away from her and her child. That moment was given to her husband by the child being in his care and he promptly offloaded them to another woman instead of the child's mother when it could have easily waited until mom's time.\n\nNo good parent has children hoping another person raises them.

It\u2019s also not wrong for mom to prefer that puberty/body talks and underwear purchases are done with parents rather than step-parents. That\u2019s a pretty normal expectation.\n\nOne of the key parts of co-parenting is communicating and dad could have very easily checked in with mom to let her know what was going on *before* the shopping trip took place.

You are a safe, respectful and supportive, nonjudgmental adult. If Eve was that, Emma would have told her mother. Eve is just mad that Emma went to you and not her. She is too immature, jealous,  controlling and resentful to see that  Emma is fortunate to have another adult she loves her that Emma feels safe disclosing private information to.", "The woman should have taken her to the store already, she's blind to how her child was feeling, do not give up having conversations with her because it sounds like the mother wants to control things but actually do nothing of any importance for the child", "That's what I was about to say.", "I think that's a good reason as to why it should be ok for Emma to discuss such things with her stepmother.\n\nI get Eve might feel she missed out on important mother-daughter milestones, but what she's insisting on is ultimately selfish. Would she rather her daughter remain distressed or upset for a week, just so she gets to be the one to comfort her? Or would she prefer she has a trusted female available to her at all times, so she can be reassured and comforted as soon as possible?\n\nOP did the best she could. She showed concern for the kid. She explained things to her and comforted her. She discussed the situation in private with her father. She suggested options that might help make his daughter feel better. She offered those suggestions to the daughter and let her choose what would make her feel better. She informed the girl's mother that there had been a situation, what had happened and that she may now want to get involved, too. I'd call that about as mature as one could get.", "This happened to me too. My mother wasn't in the picture so I had no female figure to talk to me about these things. I learned about menstruation at girl scouts and I didn't realize I was in dire need of real bras at age 11 until my gym teacher called my grandma and told her kids were picking on me. Body issues weren't something my family spoke about. I wasnt allowed to mention periods, Id just write pads on my grandmas shopping list and theyd magically appear in a bag in my bedroom. I wish I had had someone like OP to help me at that age. She sounds like a wonderful stepmom.", ">She thought that her training bra would be fine with the shirt that she wore that day\n\nInitial bra purchase already happened, so this incident was because it was time for an upgrade.", "And in a few years time, when her period starts, should OP help her out or send her back to mum to avoid offence? The mum needs to sort herself out. I'm afraid it's part and parcel of co-parenting.", "I was going to say the same thing! Mom should have noticed her daughter needed a bigger bra. I have a daughter going through what this girl is going through. I check on her bras weekly for their fit. My daughter also comes to me when she notices they are getting small. I am thankful she feels comfortable talking with me about it, however if she felt more comfortable going to her aunt I would support her in that. I would be hurt, but want her to feel completely comfortable and safe. This is a thought time for a girl and she should feel completely at ease going to whomever she is most comfortable with.", "Yes, and this was in a rural area, around 2000 or so. I'm sure we have better access now, as you say, and we are so fortunate! When Mina grew up a bit, and her rib cage expanded, things were a bit better, although pricey. She couldn't purchase little lacy things, I suspect, like teenage friends who wore more normal range sizes. My big busted HS friends in the late 70s were consigned to very matronly, boring bras.", "Neither did Dad or Step-Mom until the girl was visibly upset because Step-Mom and Dad didn't notice their relative making fun of her at the holiday", "NTA", "YTA this should have been a group effort. If you and Dan had communicated with her mother. Then she could have stopped by to discuss things and shop with her daughter. It was a milestone that she missed out on. What you did for her wasn\u2019t wrong, but if it\u2019s and big issue then those discusssion should happen between the parents.", "NTA. Co-parenting is not about your feelings. It's about the best interest of the child. Even if she was hurt by what you did, she should be grateful that you helped her daughter, she should simply thank you and if she's upset she can cry about it, but what matters most is the child.", "NTA \n\nPeople besides her bio mom were already talking to her about her body (awful cousins). Your job is to have the best relationship possible with your step daughter (not step daughters bio mom).", "NTA. I'm a bonus mom myself and I think you handled this well! You are approachable with her and she trusts you, you discussed the situation with her father who gave you the go ahead and you let her know before the house switch. If her mother has an issue, she needs to take it up with her father, not you.\n\n Im firmly of the opinion that it doesn't matter who the trusted parent is, be it parents, stepparents or even grandparents, as long as the child has a person they can trust who can support and guide them appropriately, it doesn't matter. I understand it may hurt to not always be your child's first choice, but ultimately we have to do what's best for the child and I believe you did that.\n\nPersonally, my stepkid goes to different parents about different things, and that's okay! It means kiddo is talking to someone they trust and are comfortable talking about that issue with and is getting support and wisdom from somebody who has their best interests at heart."]}
