The fact that you would've married him yet he was just playing a mean prank is arguably unforgivable. If you left, he will learn a hard lesson about what it means to actually be husband material, and you will be hurt for a while but will find someone who would rightfully consider such a thing unthinkable.

Hard.", "Get rid of him. Like yesterday. What an overflowing trash bag of a human.", "NTA, but he certainly is. If your bf would treat you in such a horrible manner, I would suggest to seriously consider finding a new bf. The sheer lack of empathy alone is mind-boggling.

This was mean and demoralizing. Shame on him. He deserves to be left over this. I\u2019m so sorry.", "OP, I am so sorry. What a cruel \"joke.\" I am not a fan of strangers on the Internet telling people in long-term relationships to break up, but.... Is this really the man you want to be with?\n\nHe doesn't sound the least bit remorseful.
