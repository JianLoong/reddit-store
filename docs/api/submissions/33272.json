This was a very cruel joke and in front of your family. I think you really ought to re-evaluate your relationship with him. \n\nEven if he does give you a real engagement ring at some point soon, his motives will be questionable.", "NTA. Dump him. Leave. That is one of the most cruel things I have ever heard. I am so sorry. You do not deserve that. You are young and you can and will find so much better.", "NTA. There is such a thing as taking a joke too far, and this right here is it.", "Sounds like you dodged a bullet. Kick him to the curb and move on while you\u2019re still young!", "NTA\n\nI bet if you did get married you'd ask him not to cake smash you, and he would...", "So not only did he embarrass you in front of your family, but he further embarrassed you in social media? That\u2019s pathological. NTA", "NTA, wtaf? This is something I'd expect from a 17yr old, not a 25 year old man. The fact that you would've married him yet he was just playing a mean prank is arguably unforgivable. If you left, he will learn a hard lesson about what it means to actually be husband material, and you will be hurt for a while but will find someone who would rightfully consider such a thing unthinkable. On the other hand you could work it out but he needs to be made SERIOUSLY aware that this sort of behavior can not be tolerated.", "NTA. And you\u2019re still there?? Are you stuck in a lease? Share a bank account? Your parents would probably put you up for a while till you got a roommate or your own apt. If you were my daughter I\u2019d have you packed up and out. \nThat dude is a moron. Huge huge red flag.", "NTA. I really hate hearing about partners doing \"prank\" proposals, and doubly worse for those who embarrass their partners for internet clout\n\n\"it's just a prank bro\" doesn't suddenly undo all the hurt feelings and embarrassment, you had every right to be upset.", "Throw this one back.  Hard.", "Get rid of him. Like yesterday. What an overflowing trash bag of a human.", "NTA, but he certainly is. If your bf would treat you in such a horrible manner, I would suggest to seriously consider finding a new bf. The sheer lack of empathy alone is mind-boggling. He saw how upset you were, and had your family kick him out over it, and STILL chose to upload the video? Has he always been this oblivious to the feelings of others or is this something new?", "NTA. If he doesn't care enough for your feelings and play with something so precious to you, you should kick his sorry knuckle head out.", "NTA\nhe\u2019s a d*ckhead, especially because he posted it on his story and laughed about it. i\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve had a smooth relationship thus far, but perhaps it\u2019s time to reevaluate.", "NTA but if you marry him after this nasty, humiliating prank he performed on you in front of your family and then posted for attention on social media you would be Mrs. Asshole. I wish much better for you.", "NTA- the major thing with a prank is that the person getting pranked has to be able to find it funny, or it\u2019s incredibly cruel.  He showed a callous disregard for your feelings.  That\u2019s cruel.  He\u2019s definitely the asshole, and he needs to work to make you feel safe with him again, or accept the fact that you never will.  It\u2019s on him, he\u2019s the one that broke the trust.", "If he was planning on pranking you, and he did that by playing with your feelings, then you have every right to be upset. I would try talk to him a bit more though, see if you can work things out, but no, NTA. He wasn\u2019t giving the gift for sincerity, he was giving it to mess around with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Usually, I'm all in gor talking things out but not only humiliating you in front of the whole family but *posting it online* is taking way too far.\n\nOn top of that, if it still on Snapchat, I'd contact them to take it down. This is absolutely insane.", "NTA - So he posted a video of it as well, that is beyond cruel dump him.", "Let me get this straight. He thought it would be funny to humiliate you? In front of your family and then blast it out on Socials? NTA but he is.", "This is not the right answer. You\u2019ve been together 8 years, don\u2019t let a prank end all those years together. You\u2019re still NTA, but leaving him is not the right answer.", "I don\u2019t think he wanted to hurt her feelings. Kicking him to the curb is probably too drastic of a decision, especially considering it was just a bad prank.", "That's a boy who deserves to be forever single! ESPECIALLY since he uploaded it for all to see!\n\nFucking 8yrs, too!! What an absolute fucking dick!\n\nBut (literally) anything for those clicks, I guess!\n\nThis will be a horrific moment for this poor girl forever.", "In front of her family. He humiliated her and blew up his relationship with them over a tiktok. I don't think that is recoverable.", "He played with her emotions, humiliated in front of her family, filmed it and posted it on internet. All was premeditated. He dedicated time and money to make her feel awful and shared it to the world while she was clearly in distress.\n\nHe ran out of things to work out the second he chose to share the video instead of delete it and come appologize when she left in tears.", "Which is why he is the asshole.", "8 years and he still didn't give her a ring.. he just playing with her", "It is totally the right answer. \n\nYou don't get to humiliate your partner in front of everyone and then post it online, showing absolutely no remorse, without any consequences. I couldn't trust someone like that anymore. This was cruel.", "You falling into the trap of \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d just because they have been together for 8 years doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t ever leave. He disrespected her and even after seeing low upset she was he put it online. He sounds awful and she can do better", "I feel like your intentions are good, but you are 100% leaning into the sunk-cost fallacy rn.", "Leaving an asshole who plays a cruel prank on you and then posts it on Snapchat, gloating that you fell for it? That's *exactly* the right answer. It's the only sane answer.", "He posted a video mocking her to snap chat.  That would be over the line and i would break up immediately.", "It wasn\u2019t just a bad prank, he made her look like a fool in front of her whole family then doubled down on the humiliation by posting it on snap chat! So ya I\u2019d say he doesn\u2019t care about her feelings at all.", "You forgot the part where he bragged that she fell for it on social media.", "Why is it his job to give her a ring? Can't she do it? Can't they decide together?\n\nI think she's NTA but this reasoning in 2023 is ridiculous.", "I\u2019m not saying he will 100% give the ring, but as long as he said he would, and as long as OP still cares about him, then giving up on the relationship might be too drastic a decision.", "I'll be so glad when the popularity of these stupid / cruel / ridiculous pranks goes away. \"Ha ha I tricked my forever gf into thinking I wanted to marry her!\" isn't funny. It'd be one thing if he did this \"prank\" in private (still an asshole move) but to do it in front of her family... disrespectful as shit. \"Hurr hurr she shouldn't throw away eight years over a joke\" but he's fine hurting her like this for a joke.\n\nNTA and I'll say it: DTMDA.", "Yeah, what he did was bad, I won\u2019t argue you there, but it shouldn\u2019t be an absolute deal breaker, especially after all the years they\u2019ve had together. That\u2019s why the best thing to do is to simply talk with him, and see if they can work things out. If they can, great, if they can\u2019t, then she can see if moving on is the best option.", "He involved other people in his \u201cjoke\u201d and those people just so happened to be OPs family. Hes not coming back from this lmfao, the family isn\u2019t gonna let him.", "Obviously no one here really know the nuances of their relationship and maybe they can make it work that will be up to OP\u2026 but if she\u2019s looking for an outside opinion based solely on what\u2019s she\u2019s told is I\u2019d say that\u2019s not the type of guy you want to have to rely on the rest of your life. That\u2019s not the type of guy that will have your back. He\u2019s the type of guy who will humiliate you in public and not apologize when he knows how much it hurt you\u2026really not husband material. Like I said she dodged a bullet.", "This isn\u2019t the family\u2019s decision. This is OP\u2019s, and trying to work things out instead of just leaving the relationship is the right thing to try and do. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out, at least she tried to make things get better again.", "She hasn\u2019t dodged a bullet. They\u2019re just not talking, but hopefully they can try and work things out. You\u2019re right, we don\u2019t know the nuances on their relationship, so it\u2019s unfair to say that one dumb thing defines an entire person and who they are.", "And her decision may be influenced by her family, it\u2019s not uncommon. He did humiliate her in front of them, and then he got removed from the home by OPs dad. \n\nSeriously, there is no coming back from this unless he is actually remorseful, which right now - he isn\u2019t. \n\nHE needs to make the effort, not OP.", "The bullet she dodged was that she thought she was getting proposed to but in the end it wasn\u2019t a proposal\u2026she dodged getting hitched to the kind of guy who would put a lot of thought effort and money into humiliating her. It\u2019s a a cruel prank. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be with her if he\u2019s going to treat her like that. \nOP didn\u2019t say he\u2019s been trying to apologize to her for 2 weeks, she said she told him how she felt, he didn\u2019t care, and they haven\u2019t talked for 2 weeks since.", "Why would you want to work it out with a person who thought social lulz were more important than how his actual girlfriend felt?\n\nShe won't.  It's over. Her bf is an oaf. He should take the l and grow up.", "Starting to think we've found the boyfriend's account based on how much you're bending over backwards to defend absolutely cruel behavior.", "Yeah, he does need to make the effort, you\u2019re right. If he doesn\u2019t reach out, then that would only look bad for him. OP doesn\u2019t need to do anything yet, but hopefully he will reach out, and they can try and work things out. But if he does reach out, OP shouldn\u2019t try to end things because of this one incident.", "This one incident is big and shouldn\u2019t be addressed as some small boo boo like forgetting a birthday for the first time.", "What he did was wrong, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cend of the world, break up immediately\u201d wrong. Look, I don\u2019t think either of us will make the other one agree with them, but we can both agree that OP is NTA, and that\u2019s really all that matters. Anything else that happens is her choice."]}
