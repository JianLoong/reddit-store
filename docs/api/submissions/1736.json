Is there a waiver process?\n\nI can only speak to my locale. A kid that was quite bright went through all our grade school, high school and entered into university at 13. Book smart, but needed growth in other areas and struggled with the lack of structure. It kinda undid some of his advancement but doing great overall. Lots of my classmates had enough credits to graduate at 16 but stayed to take more broad courses while still taking a few university level ones catered to transition high schoolers.\n\nNot relevant now, but under 16 people deliver the paper. 16 you can cook food, serve coffee, work a warehouse. You can wield a service rifle in the armed forces.  Can volunteer. I don't think 16 is young at all to do anything. Has she had a lot of group involvement outside of homeschooling like community, church, youth groups etc?\n\nI'd be inclined to give her a semester's worth off and stop the nagging. Maybe even promote some travel and finding self.  Later down the road give some positive influences that your work and education has given you. Often I find people hate their jobs and just do it to survive so need to be wary of that framing.", "or what? do you kick her out? ground her for 2 years?", "NAH.

It's not like she can just time-jump to 18 and start university. What she does in the meantime matters a lot and will change the course of her life.", "You are NTA, however, it seems your younger daughter is on her way to becoming one. Encouraging her to get a job and develop a good work ethic is not being overbearing in any sense.

Proir work experience isn't just good for getting a into a uni, it is extremely important for getting a job after uni. I am a commercial/industrial superintendent for a general contractor. I run construction jobs from the field (schedules, plan interpretation, safety, ect). I am not formally educated from a university but gained my experience on the job. I also didn't graduate college nor did I work as an apprentice in any of the trades. What I did have was overall work experience. I worked in retail since I was 16 before joining the military and also spending some years in law enforcement. \n\nMy point of explaining my background is this. Your ability to show a work ethic, especially when that work is hard and requires leadership is just as good as that uni diploma when u submit your resume. I got chosen for this high pay/high demand job not because I was experienced but because I showed a high level of leadership and ability to work. When she gets out of college she may have a slight leg up thanks to her smarts but nothing gets you a job over your peers like the ability to show work. \n\nI have one more example before I end this wall of text. My wife has a masters degree in education. A 4.0 GPA in her undergrad and a 4.2! In her graduates degree. She had to submit over 400 resumes before she got a job. She had zero work experience. I made one phone call and had one interview when I got my first construction job. I'm working for my second company now and I got the job the same way as the first. \n\nTl;Dr. Showing the ability to work and lead is just as important as straight A's.", "NTA you're saving her from trouble. It's hard to get your foot in the door of any career without any work history. At least having a small job like babysitting or mowing lawns would be something to show work ethic. However, I suggest opening up her options to volunteering as well, if she doesn't need to be saving up for school that is. That way she has more options and long term volunteer work looks great for your work ethic.", "Nah yet.  I had a customer service job at 14, but it was *my* choice.  At 16 she should still be in education.  Whether that is online classes (even just auditing them for no credit), volunteering for what she wants to do, or an apprenticeship\n\n\nNot wanting your kid to sit around 2 years.

It will also give her the opportunity to expand her social circle, which I think is healthy.\n\nBut I think you need to approach her with the benefits of working, rather than demanding she get a job, if you see what I mean. If it doubt, make it seem like it\u2019s their idea.\n\nBear in mind though that a lot of places won\u2019t be looking for a young teen with no experience for a full time job.

You can't leave education to start work by law", "As of the law rn children need to be in education until they are 18", "The US is not the world though. British teens earn \u00a35 an hour and can only do 35 hours a week, that's a max of \u00a3175 a week, or \u00a39100 a year, which averages at \u00a3758 a month. Do I think they need to be doing something? Absolutely, do I think any job that isn't one step short of slave labour is going to look at them, nope", "I agree, but since it's not a financial necessity, the kid would be better off earning money slowly while investing in their skills", "I suppose that's true, but my logic is more \"I suffered so nobody else should\" instead of \"since I suffered everybody should too\"", "I didn't say she didn't \"not work\". I said she didn't get to relax.", "You explained that your daughter wants to study medicine. Maybe get her to volunteer/work at a clinic or at an hospital? It will look good on her cv and she\u2019ll get to learn a bit more about the environment she wants to work in. However, I would suggest to give her some slack about it. She worked her butt off to finish early and deserves a decent break. Kids get three months of break after they finish school so you could at least give her that.", "In England only. The other three UK countries you can leave at/around 16 depending on term dates.", "No, they don't. In England they need to be in education or training (including apprenticeships) until 18. Wales, Scotland and NI you can leave at 16 and begin full-time work depending on the month that you turn 16 and how that fits with school term dates. \n\nSome leavers will have to stay on a significant amount of time after 16, I believe NI is the strictest on this.", "What that teaches kids is that since they got good grades it means that minimum wage jobs are beneath them.", "Because she spent months being anxious? That\u2019s your argument here? Man being an adult is going to kick that kids ass if waiting for results was that taxing", "Ach rubbish. You do you final exam and then chill until a week before results come out.", "Has she looked at what it takes to get accepted for medicine in the UK? Good grades are not going to be enough.\n\nAssuming she'll be 18 in time for the 2024/5 academic year, then she's got a year to really focus on things like getting work experience, other extra curriculars, practicing admission tests, etc. Without these, she won't stand a chance.", "She absolutely will not get into a medicine course with just her grades, especially if she's not still in school. They don't want candidates who just lie around the house all day watching tv. I applied to a competitive university (not medicine though) a year out from my a levels and it didn't matter that I had perfect grades like your daughter, they wanted to know what I was doing with my time now. Luckily I had a job so I was able to talk about that. It would have been incredibly embarrassing to say nothing. NTA you are helping your daughter.", "She could absolutely enroll in university for her core classes that are required, but aren't part of the medical curriculum.", "Are basics like history not part of a medical degree?", "Whether or not a kid has good grades, their financial situation will determine how early they have to enter the workforce. If this parent can provide, the student would benefit better from time invested towards a specific goal instead of just whatever local part time job. It's a blessing to not have to work minimum wage. The work is emotionally demanding, customers are AH especially to teens. You get paid little and are expected to be on your feet for 8+ hours. Some retail jobs require specific dress (heels, jewelry, makeup) Food jobs require difficult hard manual labor. Not saying the people who work those jobs are unimportant or lesser, because I worked those jobs, dude. Up until this year. From 16 and all through college. When I finally got an office job, I was shocked. Because it was too easy. I couldn't believe that work didn't have to be so demanding. Yes I built rewarding traits, but my parents can only wish that could have provided more.", "The fact that you aren't making ***any*** effort at **communicating** with her... for that, YTA. \n\nYou have a 16 year old that is apparently sleeping *quite* a bit, and apparently has no interest in anything. Doesn't that *concern* you at all? The possibility of depression? The fact that you had a kid *so* driven, that she excelled and aced all her classes early, and now... is aimless. \n\n***Talk*** to your kid. Stop judging her for being \"lazy\", and TALK to her.", "that's not typically how it works in the UK", "Aren\u2019t bachelor degrees in the UK typically only 3 years?", "She could do graduate entry medicine...", "I don't know UK terms or laws, but could she get an EMT cert?  Even if she isn't old enough to ride an ambulance, kids sporting events like to have an EMT around in case of injury.  \n\nOr she could get a part time job at a retirement home or physical therapy type place.  They always seem to be hiring for the crappy jobs.  Then her resume (CV?) can show that she has seen the crappy side of medicine and isn't just another wannabe TV doctor.", "What are you talking about?", "Thats not how things work in the UK, medicine is a 5 year course and the way its structured you can't start part of it without the rest. \n\nShe could do a seperate bio or chem degree before medicine but thats about it but undergrad courses are 3 years long.", "People don't change programs/majors in the UK?", "Medicine in UK is a 5 year undergraduate program, you'd typically start at 18 straight after A levels", "No idea, but bio/chem classes will at least be helpful in preparation for a medical degree.", "And will add thousands more to her student debt", "Generally speaking, no.", "Unless it's eg Philosophy and Theology to Philosophy or BA Geography to MA geography or something no we don't do that", "No, outside the US, you study the degree you want from the get go. In Britain, like my native Ireland, you go to uni and study nursing off the bat, or veterinary, medicine, law, etc. You don't spend years building more unnecessary debt. You simply do the degree you want. The only areas this differs is the likes of arts and general sciences where you go more focused into certain areas as you progress your uni years", "That's adding thousands more pounds of debt for no good reason.", "Yeah thats true tbh. Im lucky in that i did my nursing course when the nhs paid the tuition. So my debt was smaller at the end. Its a shame that people are being costed out of these courses.", "She could just be introverted. Sure you can be depressed and do great in school but I dont think it's likely. She may just have friends online she socializes with."]}
