Is there a waiver process?\n\nI can only speak to my locale. A kid that was quite bright went through all our grade school, high school and entered into university at 13. Book smart, but needed growth in other areas and struggled with the lack of structure. It kinda undid some of his advancement but doing great overall. Lots of my classmates had enough credits to graduate at 16 but stayed to take more broad courses while still taking a few university level ones catered to transition high schoolers.\n\nNot relevant now, but under 16 people deliver the paper. 16 you can cook food, serve coffee, work a warehouse. You can wield a service rifle in the armed forces.  Can volunteer. I don't think 16 is young at all to do anything. Has she had a lot of group involvement outside of homeschooling like community, church, youth groups etc?\n\nI'd be inclined to give her a semester's worth off and stop the nagging. Maybe even promote some travel and finding self.  Later down the road give some positive influences that your work and education has given you. Often I find people hate their jobs and just do it to survive so need to be wary of that framing.", "or what? do you kick her out? ground her for 2 years?", "NAH.

It's not like she can just time-jump to 18 and start university. What she does in the meantime matters a lot and will change the course of her life.", "You are NTA, however, it seems your younger daughter is on her way to becoming one. Encouraging her to get a job and develop a good work ethic is not being overbearing in any sense.

As you said she finished her education early. Even if she gets a job or not --- whatever she decides to do, it's her own life that she needs to learn it by experiencing the choices (and consequences, whether beneficial) she made herself.

Proir work experience isn't just good for getting a into a uni, it is extremely important for getting a job after uni. I am a commercial/industrial superintendent for a general contractor. I run construction jobs from the field (schedules, plan interpretation, safety, ect). I am not formally educated from a university but gained my experience on the job. I also didn't graduate college nor did I work as an apprentice in any of the trades. What I did have was overall work experience. I worked in retail since I was 16 before joining the military and also spending some years in law enforcement. \n\nMy point of explaining my background is this. Your ability to show a work ethic, especially when that work is hard and requires leadership is just as good as that uni diploma when u submit your resume. I got chosen for this high pay/high demand job not because I was experienced but because I showed a high level of leadership and ability to work. When she gets out of college she may have a slight leg up thanks to her smarts but nothing gets you a job over your peers like the ability to show work. \n\nI have one more example before I end this wall of text. My wife has a masters degree in education. A 4.0 GPA in her undergrad and a 4.2! In her graduates degree. She had to submit over 400 resumes before she got a job. She had zero work experience. I made one phone call and had one interview when I got my first construction job. I'm working for my second company now and I got the job the same way as the first. \n\nTl;Dr. Showing the ability to work and lead is just as important as straight A's.", "NTA you're saving her from trouble. It's hard to get your foot in the door of any career without any work history. At least having a small job like babysitting or mowing lawns would be something to show work ethic. However, I suggest opening up her options to volunteering as well, if she doesn't need to be saving up for school that is. That way she has more options and long term volunteer work looks great for your work ethic.", "Nah yet.  I had a customer service job at 14, but it was *my* choice.  At 16 she should still be in education.  Whether that is online classes (even just auditing them for no credit), volunteering for what she wants to do, or an apprenticeship\n\n\nNot wanting your kid to sit around 2 years.

It will also give her the opportunity to expand her social circle, which I think is healthy.\n\nBut I think you need to approach her with the benefits of working, rather than demanding she get a job, if you see what I mean. If it doubt, make it seem like it\u2019s their idea.\n\nBear in mind though that a lot of places won\u2019t be looking for a young teen with no experience for a full time job.

I wanted to do history and ended up working at a museum through university, thanks to volunteering there from 16 onwards. Also, if anyone from the council comes for an inspections, volunteering can be spun as an educational experience far more than most jobs you can get at 16 (she can still get a job, though, since most places don't allow you to volunteer for more than 16 hours a week, otherwise you could claim to be an employee).\n\n3) This is incredibly harsh, but you need to get your daughter to understand that all As and A\\*s is not that rare. She needs to stand out from the crowd and just being home schooled is not enough of a selling feature. She also (in my experience) will need to prove that she is able to play well with others. The first thing I was asked in interviews (work and education) when they saw 'home schooled' on my resume was always \"can you cope working around other people?/So you're anti-social?\".

Two years without studying and then setting of into the higher level can be difficult. A part time job isn\u2019t a bad idea, but nor is maybe a little more studying- another a level, or maybe an open university level one module (they\u2019re designed to bring you through a level into first year university study, and depending on what she\u2019s planning to do, the humanities ones cover a range of different subjects which could be interesting.)\nThat said, sitting a levels - and getting such good results - by 16 is rather intense. She might feel a little burned out, maybe have a talk about how she\u2019s feeling. \nThe problem with being advanced as a young age is that your contemporaries sometimes have an annoying habit of catching up with you, I would definitely suggest returning to some kind - part time - of study the year before she goes.", "NTA.\n\nShe can't watch tv for 2 years.

NTA, you are right to be concerned about her future. After 2 year break while doing nothing it will be very hard to go to university. \n\nBut maybe you can search for a compromise: volunteering, part time job, studying / learning something else (like doing a course in something that she is interested, or a craft of some sort).\n\nIf money is not the issue in your family then she can only volunteer. If money is important too, then you should explain that to her. My advice: give her 3 different options to choose from. Also give her the \"trial\" period.

And let me tell ya I do not regret playing video games for all those months and doing absolutely nothing productive. A good break between one highly demanding commitment to another.  \n\nLet the kid watch Netflix! She worked hard. Burn out is real. Maybe get her to do some chill volunteering or something.

Much like internships, you could easily find volunteer work in a field you are interested in, which will provide you with firsthand personal and professional experience that will give you a significant edge over other applicants, be it for academic or professional purposes. You can volunteer at museums, science/research labs, libraries, small businesses, and even hospitals to an extent. \n\nNot only do they bolster one's resume significantly, but they can be extremely helpful for finding fields and topics that you are interested in pursuing, without the commitment of a formal internship or job. Hell, even good Samaritan volunteer work like picking trash off of the beach every weekend can lead to some people realizing that they have deeper interests in things like environmental conservation and/or marine biology. Or volunteering in a food kitchen/homeless shelter and realizing that you have a passion for social work. Just as importantly, you can also figure out what you absolutely *aren't* interested in pursuing further.

It is highly unlikely that good grades while homeschooling will get her a placement. Yet another reason not to homeschool your children, if you know they're interested in highly competitive programs like medicine, veterinary science, etc, have them transfer and get the diploma or degree or qualifications from an actual school. They will be at a massive disadvantage to kids from traditional schools.\n\nThe amount of work she'll have to do on her own to overcome this disadvantage is going to be intense.
