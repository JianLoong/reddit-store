Is there a waiver process?\n\nI can only speak to my locale. A kid that was quite bright went through all our grade school, high school and entered into university at 13. Book smart, but needed growth in other areas and struggled with the lack of structure. It kinda undid some of his advancement but doing great overall. Lots of my classmates had enough credits to graduate at 16 but stayed to take more broad courses while still taking a few university level ones catered to transition high schoolers.\n\nNot relevant now, but under 16 people deliver the paper. 16 you can cook food, serve coffee, work a warehouse. You can wield a service rifle in the armed forces.  Can volunteer. I don't think 16 is young at all to do anything. Has she had a lot of group involvement outside of homeschooling like community, church, youth groups etc?\n\nI'd be inclined to give her a semester's worth off and stop the nagging. Maybe even promote some travel and finding self.  Later down the road give some positive influences that your work and education has given you. Often I find people hate their jobs and just do it to survive so need to be wary of that framing.", "or what? do you kick her out? ground her for 2 years?", "NAH.

It's not like she can just time-jump to 18 and start university. What she does in the meantime matters a lot and will change the course of her life.", "You are NTA, however, it seems your younger daughter is on her way to becoming one. Encouraging her to get a job and develop a good work ethic is not being overbearing in any sense.

As you said she finished her education early. Even if she gets a job or not --- whatever she decides to do, it's her own life that she needs to learn it by experiencing the choices (and consequences, whether beneficial) she made herself.

At some point she will have to find one, but if you push too hard it's only going to piss her off worse.", "NTA. Proir work experience isn't just good for getting a into a uni, it is extremely important for getting a job after uni. I am a commercial/industrial superintendent for a general contractor. I run construction jobs from the field (schedules, plan interpretation, safety, ect). I am not formally educated from a university but gained my experience on the job. I also didn't graduate college nor did I work as an apprentice in any of the trades. What I did have was overall work experience. I worked in retail since I was 16 before joining the military and also spending some years in law enforcement. \n\nMy point of explaining my background is this. Your ability to show a work ethic, especially when that work is hard and requires leadership is just as good as that uni diploma when u submit your resume. I got chosen for this high pay/high demand job not because I was experienced but because I showed a high level of leadership and ability to work. When she gets out of college she may have a slight leg up thanks to her smarts but nothing gets you a job over your peers like the ability to show work. \n\nI have one more example before I end this wall of text. My wife has a masters degree in education. A 4.0 GPA in her undergrad and a 4.2! In her graduates degree. She had to submit over 400 resumes before she got a job. She had zero work experience. I made one phone call and had one interview when I got my first construction job. I'm working for my second company now and I got the job the same way as the first. \n\nTl;Dr. Showing the ability to work and lead is just as important as straight A's.", "NTA you're saving her from trouble. It's hard to get your foot in the door of any career without any work history. At least having a small job like babysitting or mowing lawns would be something to show work ethic. However, I suggest opening up her options to volunteering as well, if she doesn't need to be saving up for school that is. That way she has more options and long term volunteer work looks great for your work ethic.", "Nah yet.  I had a customer service job at 14, but it was *my* choice.  At 16 she should still be in education.  Whether that is online classes (even just auditing them for no credit), volunteering for what she wants to do, or an apprenticeship\n\n\nNot wanting your kid to sit around 2 years.

It will also give her the opportunity to expand her social circle, which I think is healthy.\n\nBut I think you need to approach her with the benefits of working, rather than demanding she get a job, if you see what I mean. If it doubt, make it seem like it\u2019s their idea.\n\nBear in mind though that a lot of places won\u2019t be looking for a young teen with no experience for a full time job.

Go for a walk together, go out for lunch, something. I know teenagers can be stubborn or push buttons but maybe start by telling her how proud you are of her but you\u2019re worried that two years off will slow her to lose some of her fantastic hard working skills and also by working/interning/volunteering now, she\u2019s setting herself up for her job search when she finishes university.

Good luck to you both.", "Have you asked her why she's would rather stay at home and do nothing?  Without being judgemental?\n\nI do think this time of year is maybe not the best time to make an issue.  Together, discuss a plan for after the holidays.  \n\nWhat you need to remember, no amount of nagging will ever motivate someone.  You need to be her partner, not a driver.  The best you can do is to provide only the minimal food, shelter, clothing and restrain from extras to motivate her to earn what she wants.\n\n16 is a hard age to be rudderless.", "Did you push your older kid to get a job at 16?", "Expect she will never have that rest again in her life", "From what I remember, my A-levels were all finished by the end of June.

The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich. In England in the early nineteenth century fifteen hours was the ordinary day\u2019s work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very commonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busy-bodies suggested that perhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults from drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say, \u201cWhat do the poor want with holidays? they ought to work.\u201d People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much economic confusion.
